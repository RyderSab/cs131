US	52988732	RSZAMSMNO4P2U	0966678702	901313396	Aircraft Acquisition Planning	Books	3	5	5	N	Y	Basic Corporate Aviation Analysis	This book is an introductory text for procuring a corporate aircraft and setting up a corporate flight department. The authors are distinguished in their field, but knowing a lot does not necessarily mean that they are gifted writers. The book is very dull, even more than an average textbook, and is fairly amateurish in overall presentation. The specifics are quite dated (particularly in the aircraft specific selection area), but most important principles are discussed, although frequently only in a cursory manner.<br /><br />The book covers aircraft needs, key missions, evaluation parameters, technical analysis (which is one of the weaker sections), fleet size, financial alternatives and analysis (even though more options now exist than when the book was written), and acquisition planning.<br /><br />The book is very general, and the combination of large margins, large font, and many black and white illustrations means that you can comfortably read this book in one dedicated day. The material presented is good, it just isn't especially detailed. Certainly someone wanting to know the intricacies of financial analysis for corporate aviation will need additional references, as will people who want to learn to evaluate different corporate aircraft for potential purchase or lease.<br /><br />I think the book rates three stars: the material is general, but overall fairly good, but the production values leave something to be desired, as does the currency and completeness of the text.	2005-09-28

I have been interested in this subject for many years now both as an airline pilot (I flew the 737 for almost two years, and must in all candor say that it was my least favorite of the nine different airliner types that I have flown; In all fairness to Boeing, many of my colleagues seem to really enjoy flying the 737, but after my personal experience with the plane, I still can't understand why) and a student (I wrote my Master's thesis on a quantitative systems safety comparison of 737 and A-320 primary flight control systems.) Of the two books on the market which focus on USAir flight 427 (the other, by Bill Adair, is also excellent) I give this one the slight edge for the average reader or the person most interested in how the NTSB \\"Party System\\" functions at a major aviation accident.<br /><br />Byrne carefully weaves the story of flight 427 in with the earlier United 585 accident (same cause) and the later Eastwind 517 incident (also the same cause) skillfully and with generally quite good technical accuracy (there are a couple of very minor technical errors, but they are inconsequential and would not be noticed by most people.) What I really appreciate about the book is Byrne's breadth of sources in reporting on not only well known and understood matters, but also on very obscure, but important background information like all the early Frontier 737 rudder malfunctions, which few are familiar with.<br /><br />The real story here is of the frustrating experience of investigating such a complex and politically charged investigation. There is no question that Boeing comes off looking bad by the end of the book, and I have to admit, deservedly so.<br /><br />The only weakness in the book is the total lack of illustrations. This is a topic that could really use illustrations, particularly when Byrne starts discussing things like the interior functions of the dual-concentric servo valve, which was ultimately the problem here.<br /><br />This is a great book, and I highly recommend it.was ultimately the problem here. <br /> <br />This is a great book, and I highly recommend it.  <br />	2005-08-23

The book is fairly technical, and would be most easily understood by people with some basic knowledge of chemistry, physics, or engineering; having said that, the authors are very good at explaining difficult ideas from general concept to specific application, which makes the book comprehensible to an average reader. One thing that makes the book easier to digest is the lack of higher math, which is frequently where this subject can bog down for non-professionals.<br /><br />I like the book especially because I appreciate the focus the authors have on system safety, including human factors issues (and the use of simulation in training). The book is great at presenting all sides of the nuclear debate, and provides the necessary background to really grasp the vital elements of nuclear safety systems. The section on Accident Sequence Precursors (ASP) is particularly strong, and demonstrates the efforts undertaken to prevent accidents by the study of minor incidents and precursors. Specific methods are discussed in terms of different types of Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), as well, which effectively shows how the pieces of the puzzle fit together (although I disagree with one of the procedural steps in Figure 2-3 \\"Accident Sequence Precursor Analysis\\" on page 117). This plus the discussion of the \\"Defense In Depth\\" (Chapter Four) concept are the most useful components of the book from a safety perspective.<br /><br />There is a very good discussion of all radioactive elements, including their decay properties, and good background information on the basic physics involved in actual practice. The discussion of core thermal hydraulic design, reactivity control, Doppler effect considerations, and the remainder of Chapter Three (\\"Control and Safety Systems\\") is particularly well written and interesting, though Chapter Four (\\"Accident Prevention\\") is probably the single most valuable chapter in the book for safety professionals.<br /><br />The book concludes with several interesting documents, including a forecast to 2015 of expected electricity consumption by country, and deals with the problems each nation faces in energy production decisions, with good coverage of the problems in China and Africa.<br /><br />This book is invaluable for nuclear safety professionals, students of nuclear energy, or concerned citizens. It is the single most readable and comprehensive background book on nuclear power that I have yet seen, and I recommend it very highly.apter Four (\\"Accident Prevention\\") is probably the single most valuable chapter in the book for safety professionals. <br /> <br />The book concludes with several interesting documents, including a forecast to 2015 of expected electricity consumption by country, and deals with the problems each nation faces in energy production decisions, with good coverage of the problems in China and Africa.  <br /> <br />This book is invaluable for nuclear safety professionals, students of nuclear energy, or concerned citizens.

My biggest issue with the book is that it really should establish that it is a Taoist guide at the outset that is as much about Eastern spirituality concepts as it is about sex. It isn't that I object to the book, it just isn't what I expected given the title and cover art.<br /><br />Having said that, there are some good pointers, and I found the chapters on health and aging to be especially well written, although I must admit that I found several of the exercises recommended to be vague and not particularly helpful.<br /><br />I think that there are better books on the subject available that are more geared to the target audience with a specific \\"how to\\" approach. If you have an interest in Eastern spiritual beliefs and want to apply them in your sex life, this is an excellent book. Many, though, will find the extensive Taoist philosophy tiresome. The book has some well written chapters and sections (chapters one, two, and eight are very well done); just be aware of what you are buying before you purchase the book.	2005-07-25

Details like that and the fact that the Molvanian diet is largely based on parsnips and pickled herring contribute to the faux-authenticity of this book, which is further aided by the realistic \\"Jetlag Travel Guide\\" binding.<br /><br />At least one reviewer took offense that this book mocked Eastern Europe, but I don't agree: the book specifically invented a fictional country to avoid ridiculing a real nation. There is certainly no mistake that Eastern Europe is economically behind the west, but given that this book was clearly written as satire, I think in general that a reader would have to be unusually sensitive to be truly offended by this work; I agree with noted travel author Bill Bryson: \\"this book is brilliantly original and very, very funny.\\" The book is a bit redundant and lengthy, which are the main detractors, in my view. It is a \\"one joke\\" book, but it is a good joke, and a very well executed one at that.	2005-07-22

The central premise of the book is that the policies enacted by liberal thinkers are more about self-aggrandizement than about implementing true positive social change in the economically lower class. Some reviewers with one-star reviews assert that Sowell's arguments are only valid for rich Republicans with no feelings for anyone but themselves, but Sowell is a master logician who also happens to have an amazing mastery of world history. Time after time Sowell shows through use of real-world cause and effect examples (buttressed by solid mathematical reasoning) the negative unintended consequences of liberal policies, and the frequent hypocrisy of liberal \\"thinkers\\" like socialist George Bernard Shaw, who found the working class to be \\"detestable\\" people who \\"have no right to live;\\" and Edmund Wilson who (in discussing World War One) confided to a friend \\"I should be insincere to make it appear that the deaths of this 'poor white trash' of the South and the rest made me feel half so bitter as the mere conscription or enlistment of any of my friends\\" (page 122). Truly, it does seem that the leftist intellectual elite are the ones with a decided lack of genuine interest in the well-being of the lower class.<br /><br />Although there are times when I disagree with Sowell, I am always open to his viewpoints, as he is truly one of the most original and brilliant thinkers and commentators of our time. While I strongly suspect that most of the one-star reviewers have not actually read this book, it would really benefit them to do so. Sowell is always a proponent of informed debate, and this is a fabulous book to be read, analyzed, and debated.	2005-07-22

Most of the criticism boils down to frustration with the facts, as the criticisms of the book don't really offer any inaccuracies in the text; they just label it as inaccurate yet give no specific objections. Many also claim what a good man Carter is, and how he is such a peacemaker, yet totally ignore the monumental foreign policy gaffes committed in his administration that directly contributed to the unstabilized world that Reagan, Bush, Clinton, and G W Bush have had to clean up, notably in the Persian Gulf and Latin America. As Henry Kissinger so eloquently put it in 1980: \\"The Carter administration has managed the extraordinary feat of having, at one and the same time, the worst relations with our allies, the worst relations with our adversaries, and the most serious upheavals in the developing world since the end of the Second World War\\" (page 107). This is a trifecta that the US decidedly did not need, and has been paying the price for ever since.<br /><br />The book casts Carter as a bumbling yet ambitious micromanager, who was unbelievably unfocused in his objectives, yet determined to have his way. Even his own Vice President, Walter Mondale, said \\"I never understood how Carter's political mind worked. Carter's got the coldest nose of any politician I ever met.\\" The \\"New Republic,\\" a periodical known for liberalism, summed up the Carter presidency thus: \\"The administration has a remarkable record. Almost everything it proposes turns to ashes\\" (Page 95). Certainly Carter's economic policies produced an unmitigated disaster (\\"stagflation\\") in which he used activist liberal spending programs  in an attempt to stimulate the economy in a move that still makes Americans old enough to remember the Carter \\"Misery Index\\" cringe when they consider liberal platforms.<br /><br />This book details not only these examples of foreign and domestic ineptitude, but unwelcome and counter productive attempts at policy creation post-1980, most of which involve coddling dictators around the world, ultimately frequently working against American goals and the cause of freedom.<br /><br />While some of Carter's post-presidential works (I'm thinking of his involvement with Habitat for Humanity here) are genuinely admirable, there is no doubt that the title of this book is accurate: he is the worst ex-president, and this book is a worthy chronicle of his life of \\"service\\".is book details not only these examples of foreign and domestic ineptitude, but unwelcome and counter productive attempts at policy creation post-1980, most of which involve coddling dictators around the world, ultimately frequently working against American goals and the cause of freedom.  <br /> <br />While some of Carter's post-presidential works (I'm thinking of his involvement with Habitat for Humanity here) are genuinely admirable, there is no doubt that the title of this book is accurate: he is the worst ex-president, and this book is a worthy chronicle of his life of \\"service\\". <br />	2005-07-22

I have to admit that I am an inexperienced softball player, who has recently joined a league for recreation. Because I had little knowledge of the game, I bought this book because it is advertised on the cover as \\"The best book on the basics of the game.\\" In retrospect I think that claim may be a bit of an overstatement because the book does assume a general working knowledge of the mechanics and rules of the game of softball. While these fundamentals are explained in pieces throughout the book, I would have really enjoyed a more thorough overview before Garman raced into chapter one, \\"Catching.\\" Don't get me wrong: this is a great book, but absolute beginners may also need an even more basic text.<br /><br />What the book does do superbly is to break down all the fundamental skills of the game of softball and give easy to comprehend (if not to execute, sometimes) explanations, tips, and techniques related to these skills, as well as sets of drills designed to develop those skills. In reading the book (from the viewpoint of a neophyte player) I couldn't help but believe that the single best audience for this book would be coaches. This book would be a positive treasure trove of information for coaches at any level of competition.<br /><br />I think this is an excellent book, and would have given it five stars if not for the omission of a general introduction, overview, and strategy section that would really help those who need the most basic \\"basics of the game.\\" As it is, I would like to give it four and a half stars, because it really is an excellent text.<br /><br />Highly recommended to softball players and coaches everywhere.	2005-07-21

I now recommend it to others for that reason, as well. Certainly the focus is on attracting the opposite sex romantically, but it is just as useful to people already involved in a steady relationship to maintain the romance in their lives. While I certainly found the observations Tracey Cox makes to be interesting, I found her underlying premises related to body language utterly fascinating.<br /><br />People who are naturally shy in potential dating situations certainly stand to benefit most from this book, but there is ample material for everyone to chew on. Most of her assertions seem to make complete sense, but a couple came across as a tad farfetched to me. Little matter: if any of her tips are true (and I believe the majority are) the book is completely worthwhile.<br /><br />The book is nicely illustrated, and generally well designed. I have to admit to being a bit put off by some of the multi-colored pages and unusual graphic design in several places which I think make it a bit more difficult to read than was really necessary. I also found it to occasionally be a trifle unorganized, sometimes to the point of needing to flip back and re-read sections. That leads me to my prevailing comment on the book: there is so much technique and information discussed here that I definitely do not feel that I have learned what I needed to from it the first time through. The book requires at least two readings to grasp the essential elements of what the author is trying to get across. I am not implying that it is a boring read (far from it), rather, that there is just a lot of information presented here.<br /><br />This book does truly help make sense of the actions of others. Whether in a steady relationship or not, this book is an excellent introduction to body language, and I recommend it.	2005-07-21

Having said that, Daryl Smith has written one of the better volumes in the series with this book on CFIT.<br /><br />Smith discusses many scenarios of CFIT (Controlled Flight Into Terrain) and includes many real-world examples with generally disastrous endings. Most of these accidents boil down to low Situational Awareness (SA) or complacency, but a wide enough cross-section is examined to keep the reader interested.<br /><br />One critique (a problem in the other volumes as well) is there are numerous grammatical, spelling, and especially subject-verb agreement/tense errors in the book. I am seriously wondering who proofread these volumes. Some of them are fairly innocuous (such as calling an L-1011 an L10-11 starting on page 26), but many are truly glaring.<br /><br />Smith covers the United 173 (UA 173, Portland) and Eastern 401 (EA 401, Everglades) accidents in particular detail, and for good reason. Not only are they vivid examples, but they both ultimately became the parents of Crew Resource Management (CRM) years later. I have no real complaints with the UA 173 accident coverage, but the EA 401 accident coverage does contain some technical errors (I have a type rating on the L-1011, and although most of the details are insignificant, a few are truly misleading) that I noticed, particularly in relation to Autopilot mode (Command vs. Control Wheel Steering [CWS]), as well as a few other systems inaccuracies.<br /><br />Smith does tackle the interesting results of the Milgram Obedience Study (page 116) including the concept of \\"Destructive Obedience\\" that can truly be a killer in the cockpit. Although I was familiar with the study, this was the first widely distributed aviation book I have seen it discussed in.<br /><br />Smith presents a good overview of the American 965 accident in Cali, Columbia, but here (and elsewhere in the book) he makes several generalized and incorrect statements regarding Flight Management Systems (FMS), and doesn't really correctly explore spoiler retraction during a go-around (GA); note that spoilers are automatically retracted in GA mode on the L-1011 and some Airbus aircraft, though not on the B-757.<br /><br />I personally do not revere Chuck Yeager, but Smith discusses Yeager's dedication to knowing his aircraft thoroughly, and I think that is a model that all pilots should follow. I salute Smith (and Yeager) for making this point so eloquently in the book.<br /><br />Starting with the premise than most CFIT accidents begin with loss of SA (normally related to terrain proximity), Smith undertakes an excellent introduction to the different types of altitudes pilots must be aware of (MEA, MCA, MVA, MOCA, MORA, MSA, etc.) starting on page 210. This is an excellent review for all pilots, and should be studied repeatedly by new instrument-rated pilots, especially. On the down side, Smith makes an erroneous statement concerning Backcourse Localizer approaches in most HSI equipped aircraft on page 242. This goes back to Yeager's doctrine of knowing your aircraft: different information is presented in many ways in different aircraft; know how yours works before you go fly (especially in IMC).<br /><br />Overall, I was pleased with this book; it has many good lessons, and despite a few obtuse technical deficiencies, the points it makes are all on target.

A Homeowner's Guide to Troublefree Pool, Spa & HotTub Maintenance	Books	4	21	22	N	Y	Good Introduction To Pool And Spa Maintenance	I own a home with a large spa in the basement. When I purchased the home, the spa was not filled with water, and since I had no experience maintaining pools or spas, I read this book to give me some general operating tips. Although the book is not written to explain details concerning all complex pool and spa maintenance procedures, it is an excellent introduction for the novice pool or spa owner.<br /><br />It is true that the author sometimes refers the reader to a trained pool professional, but I think that is appropriate given the range of possible complications. He also recommends getting a periodic professional water analysis (most pool shops will do this free or at very reasonable cost) as the chemical sticks are good for only fairly basic information. One of the strengths of the book is the explanation of the basic applied chemistry involved in pool maintenance.<br /><br />After reading this book and getting a water analysis, I have been confidently enjoying the hot tub. Overall, I recommend this book for all pool and spa owners, especially novices. People with a lot of experience with pools may desire a more advanced text, but I think this one works great for probably 99 percent of the pool and spa owners out there.	2005-07-16

I am certainly not defending this book as a piece of high literature, but I am willing to wager that not too many of these critics wrote a book at age 17. For the record, I think Crowley is occasionally tedious (the word \\"stupid\\" must be the most common adjective in the book, and the Homer Simpson references are irritating after a while, as is his hatred for cats), but I don't think he is particularly mean spirited (he thanks the creators of all these sites for providing him with material, after all). As the author he gets to define his subject, he chose the 505 stupidest sites on the web, and some of the ones he chose really do deserve to be singled out for special condemnation. Examples of humorous senselessness abound: [...] (a site dedicated to incinerating wrapped cheese slices on a grill); a site dedicated to the church of William Shatner; a site devoted to the \\"Sounds of Pasta\\" (different types of pasta being poured into a pan sound files), and of course, Britney's Guide to Semiconductor Physics, with features involving Britney Spears and advanced physics (including explanations of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers which you can read while looking at your Britney wallpaper.)<br /><br />Clearly this book was not the originator of the silliness or stupidity of the subject matter involved, and I think it's great that a 17 year old wrote a book like this. It is sometimes a bit repetitive, but overall it is a good first effort. Incidentally, Crowley has written a second book covering stupid online stores (\\"The 505 Weirdest Online Stores\\"), and I think he has improved as a writer since publishing this one.<br /><br />Most of the sites I went to from this book (which, admittedly, weren't that many) worked as of July, 2005.	2005-07-14

Despite that, I just can't bring myself to like this book. Many of the worst attributes (gore, depravity, etc.) are glorified, analyzed, and rationalized in this book, while many of the more innocent pleasures of low-budget films are largely glossed over.<br /><br />While I disliked the vast majority of the book, finding it ponderous and pretentious, I gave it an extra star (I had originally given it only one) for the insightful interviews with Ray Dennis Steckler and Doris Wishman, two of the true giants of the genre. Steckler and Wishman contrast markedly with the ghastly Frank Henenlotter, and the insufferably long interview with the ever self-important Larry Cohen plods on for an excruciating 26 pages.<br /><br />The book has a modestly interesting \\"Genre Articles\\" section, which is like a longitudinal study of trends in B-movies (and therefore is useful to serious students of film) but the self-indulgent \\"Film Essays\\" section is a painful exercise in over-analysis.<br /><br />As much as I love most of these films, I can't recommend this book. It is smug and intolerant (especially of organized religion and the US military) at all turns, and there are many better guides available.<br /><br />As a side note, the book itself is very poorly made. The binding on my copy cracked and fell off, with all the pages falling out during the first reading. The book was in such poor condition that I put it in the recycling bin at the airport when I finished it today...not that I'll miss it.<br /><br />Two stars for Steckler and Wishman (and for mentioning Coleman Francis).	2005-07-01

The book is accurate and is scrupulously unbiased, which is a rarity in any book dealing with nuclear power. The first 32 pages of the book provide the best and most concise general overview of the accident I have read, and anyone wanting to understand the accident should start here.<br /><br />The book is accessible to non-specialists, but does not make inaccurate generalizations simply for ease of explanation. There is information presented on the basic concepts of nuclear energy, which makes the book extremely valuable to someone just beginning to read on the issue. More knowledgeable readers, industry professionals, and policymakers benefit from this book as well, as it has chapters on the health effects of the accident (including recent data on ongoing longitudinal studies), environmental effects of the accident, policy effects of the accidents, and perhaps most usefully, excellent appendices which include a useful glossary, an accident timeline, and a list of common misconceptions about the TMI accident.<br /><br />The authors have done an admirable job of writing a book that is useful to both professionals and the general public. It is extremely well documented, non-political, unbiased, and scrupulously accurate. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in nuclear power.	2005-06-13

This book is filled with enormous amounts of extraordinarily obscure information on the Apollo program. The book is frustrating to read, though, because as an Apollo enthusiast I think the costs saved by canceling Apollo 18 through 20 were a pittance compared to the potential reward forfeited, especially given the enormous fixed costs already spent on the program. The book is, at times, rather (necessarily) speculative, especially in the area of crew complement, inasmuch as Deke Slayton had not announced firm crews for the final missions. I found the book rather tedious in this respect on occasion, and beyond a general discussion of crew rotation and who the front runners for the seats were, could have dispensed with a bit of the more esoteric speculation.<br /><br />The strongest point of the book for me was, unsurprisingly, also the least speculative, namely the excellent coverage of the planned Apollo 1 and Apollo 13 mission profiles. I had never known much about the Apollo 1 (actually referred to as AS-204 at the time) mission, and had always understood it to be a near duplicate of the later Apollo 7, though it was altered in several ways. Likewise, most people assume that Apollo 14 was the successful version of the Apollo 13 Fra Mauro landing, although there were differences there as well.<br /><br />Because of these strengths, I gave the book four stars, and it probably deserves four and a half, but I had two main problems with the book: the tedium of crew speculation really began to wear thin by the end of the book; and most annoyingly, there are just loads of spelling and other typographical errors, leading me to wonder where the proofreaders and editors were on this project.<br /><br />Springer-Praxis and David Shayler have a lot to be proud of, and I recommend this book to the Apollo historian who has read extensively on the subject. It is a very worthwhile book, and I am grateful to have it.orthwhile book, and I am grateful to have it. <br />	2005-06-06

This is an utterly brilliant book of English language gaffes from around the world. I frequently found myself laughing out loud when I was reading this book, and especially delighted in the interesting translations from Asia, Russia, and Italy. I could not put this book down once I started reading, and continue to pick it up and read random sections for amusement. My favorite pages are 164-166, and 182-182 which largely concern Asian and Italian mistranslations, respectively.<br /><br />Some completely random examples of perfectly stunning English are as follows:<br /><br />\\"Rocco Buttiglione: He has studied jurisprudence...under the guide of Prof. the Augosto Of the Walnut...\\"<br /><br />\\"The power of the head of state is not unlimited. Why is it said that the power of the President is not unlimited? Probably the idea comes from the English translation: 'It is not unlimited.'\\"<br /><br />\\"Brain for rent.\\"<br /><br />\\"After you vomit, you rinse your mouse and if you can eat, eat.\\"<br /><br />\\"Has any part of your body suddenly grown uncontrollable? Do you have heart thrills? Do you feel as if there were two when there is only one? Are more than half of your teeth off?

It is not so much a science text as it is a biography of the people who melded this amalgam of mathematics and science to produce an entirely new view of the world from a macro, rather than a micro viewpoint. Gleick's writing style is somewhat akin to a skilled mystery novelist, as he has a decided knack for revealing just the right tidbit at just the right time to optimally entertain and inform.<br /><br />The scientific discussions in the book are relatively shallow, as is fitting for a general audience; after all the book was a national best seller and not only to be found in obscure corners of university bookstores. True academics and professionals within the field (or more accurately, fields) may find the book interesting, but more so from a historical standpoint rather than a rigorous scientific standpoint.<br /><br />My assessment is that Gleick did the general reader a huge favor by producing this masterpiece, in that it serves as an excellent introduction to chaos theory that is accessible and comprehensible by intelligent people of varied backgrounds. In that sense he greatly surpassed his goal: this book is eminently readable and serves as a wonderful introduction to the science and personalities behind this new and wondrous theory.	2005-05-29

The strips are all here in the original order, and are immaculately produced. I was born long after these strips ran, and these are the cleanest copies of these strips that I have ever seen. The books are beautifully bound and come in a very sturdy slip jacket, which will last a lifetime if cared for.<br /><br />The strips are interesting to see the early innocence of the characters, which are all dramatically different stylistically than they were in later years. Snoopy in particular is very different looking, and has no lines in these early strips. The progression of the characters over the years is fascinating to me, particularly the development of Charlie Brown and Snoopy into the nexus of the strip.<br /><br />Although I was born long after \\"Peanuts\\" began, I still remember reading the strip as a young child, a habit I kept until Schulz passed away. These are wonderful books and I highly recommend them to anyone of any demeanor anywhere at any time for any reason.<br /><br />Thank you Charles Schulz. We miss you.	2005-05-29

Samuel Walker is a fine treatise on the Three Mile Island (TMI) accident in historical perspective. Walker deals less with the technical and physical aspects of the accident to take a more overarching view of the operations of TMI (and other nuclear plants) from a political, organizational, and managerial standpoint.<br /><br />Walker is the official historian of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and as such has spent the bulk of his professional life researching and documenting nuclear issues. He is a lucid and interesting writer for anyone interested in the material at hand. I recommend this book unequivocally. I further recommend that this book be read in tandem with \\"Hostages of Each Other\\" by Joseph Rees, which is actually my favorite general account of regulatory interactions vis-a-vis TMI.<br /><br />This is an excellent book to assist in grasping the complex regulatory, political, and corporate organizational influences in nuclear power, particularly relative to the TMI accident.	2005-05-29

I have always liked Richard Roeper's column. He is a normal, reasonable, sensible guy who is also one of the most influential critics in the country. In general I don't pay much attention to most critics because they are more full of themselves than politicians on average, and have no more real-world knowledge or sense than anyone else I come across in a typical day. Roeper is different because he grew up from centrist Midwestern, roots, and doesn't hide from that history as if it was a skeleton in the closet.<br /><br />This book is wonderful at pointing out the wretched excesses and self-centeredness of Hollywood and much of the critical world. I am particularly amused by the observations from Aspen, and never tire of Roeper exposing self-serving, hypocritical talking heads for the shallow hacks they are. Don't get me wrong, neither Roeper or I believe in censoring anyone's right to free speech, but we both believe that if a celebrity says something absolutely asinine, it deserves to be exposed as surely as if someone else said it.<br /><br />I actually prefer Roeper's daily columns to his books, but I found this book an entertaining expose that was fun to read, and was not a bit self-serving. Best of all, Roeper is still a normal guy with a normal ego, and I can't tell you how wonderful I find that to be.	2005-05-29

Both books are incredibly entertaining and have plots revolving around fairly unbelievable government programs. Chuck would have fit in here perfectly.<br /><br />This is the story of military and government intelligence officials who believe and promote utterly wacky concepts, like \\"Warrior Monks,\\" the ability to stop a goat's heart telepathically by staring at it (this was allegedly demonstrated later on guinea pigs for budgetary reasons), and the ability to walk through walls.<br /><br />Jon Ronson has a wonderful, conversational writing style. The only unfortunate part of that it is hard to tell when he is serious and when he isn't. I do not know how much of this book is true, and how much is complete, if inspired lunacy. I am not accusing Ronson (a documentary filmmaker) of fabricating anything, but given that his references are all speaking from first-person experiences which were supposedly classified, verification of these stories is nigh-impossible. In other words, even if Ronson reported the facts as he knew them, there is no way to verify the bulk of these allegations. I do know that Art Bell is discussed to a degree, and despite relative skepticism from Ronson and others, his mere appearance in the book tends to make most people (including myself) more skeptical of matters at hand.<br /><br />I don't know what parts of this book I believe and what parts to merely laugh at. Within that conundrum is the entertainment value (as disturbing as it may be) of this book.<br /><br />I recommend this book for people with open, but skeptical, minds.	2005-05-29

The book is not utterly wretched, but has no new information, and is not comprehensive in any significant way. (Again, it is little.) The illustrations are the books strong point; they are not especially lurid, but are adequate to illustrating the author's points. The problem with them is that for every four or five points needing illustration, there are one or two photographs. The photographs themselves are in color and have good color registry.<br /><br />If you are in a long-term relationship and are looking for something new to spice up your romantic life, this book is not for you. For content it is pretty low scoring, but the one exception is the last chapter \\"Health Matters,\\" which is largely common sense, but nonetheless spells out some important health and safety considerations, a few of which are less obvious than others.	2005-05-28

I give it two stars because it does, on occasion, contain good information, but more often than not is disjointed, poorly organized, and unfocused.<br /><br />The book is essentially a collection of academic papers related to Human Factors in aviation (some are moderately tangential to the subject matter at hand), and as such it is really better suited for use as a reference book than as a text. It is further limited as a text by virtue of the fact that because most of the articles are extremely specialized, giant chunks of Human Factors considerations are left totally unaddressed.<br /><br />I particularly disliked the contribution from Daniel E. Maurino, entitled \\"Crew Resource Management: A Time For Reflection.\\" There are much better resources available on CRM (and now Threat and Error Management as well.) On the other end of the quality spectrum, the article by Giovanni Costa titled \\"Fatigue and Biological Rhythms\\" is an excellent account of the effects of fatigue on human performance, and emphasizes the importance of circadian desynchronosis in aviation safety. Most of the articles range between these two in quality, but these two stand out for me as the defining ends of the spectrum.<br /><br />This book is valuable as a reference tool and for some very specialized pieces of knowledge. It is unsuitable for a survey course in Human Factors at any level, and an attempt to read it as a text is torturous at best. Combine the unsuitability as a text with the usurious price of $145.00 and this is one of the worst values around.	2005-05-28

It is fairly comprehensive, although there are some errors in the text. Having said that, the errors are not particularly egregious, and would not be readily apparent (or significant in a meaningful way) to the average reader (I am an airline pilot who had to fly the 737 for about two years, and admittedly strongly prefer flying competing products.)<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the nicer books on the 737 available, but I gave it three stars because of the aforementioned minor errors, and the fact that I don't really think it is a very good value, as it is rather expensive for what you get. Even though there are inaccuracies in the MBI books by Sharpe and Shaw (in two volumes) as well, they are readily available, have roughly equivalent coverage, and are available at a much better price for what you get. The volume on the 737-100 and -200 is the better of the two books in the MBI series by Sharpe and Shaw.	2005-05-26

Ideally I would give this book two and a half stars, but I felt generous and rounded up to three. It isn't that the book is bad, it just isn't that illuminating. There is relatively little in here that most adults have not thought of. On the plus side, it does offer a good refresher course from a woman's perspective, which is good for people (especially men, obviously) in long established relationships.<br /><br />Any time there is a list with 269 items on it, it's a given that some tips will be better than others, but most of these are common sense and general knowledge. I reiterate, though, that it is best seen as a \\"refresher course\\" for people stuck in a rut. The book has some illustrations which are generally R-rated. It also refers to several websites, at least one of which is not current.

There have been several other publications written on the subject of Gemini, but most are official NASA histories that are extremely difficult (and expensive) to obtain. In this book David Shayler documents all aspects of Project Gemini from inception to conclusion. He details not only the technical aspects of the Gemini spacecraft (and spacecraft subcomponents) but discusses the development, testing, and capabilities of the Titan, Atlas, and Agena vehicles which were so crucial in obtaining program goals. Each mission is discussed in detail, and there are many illustrations (including some I have never seen anywhere else), tables, and graphs providing most any information desired.<br /><br />The book is lengthy, but is never boring, and I reveled in the thorough treatment given to this crucial program, a program that truly was a giant step to the moon. My only critiques of the book are fairly miniscule. There are numerous typographical errors in the text, most of which are quite obvious, so I am rather surprised they slipped through proofreading. There are also a couple of insignificant errors in the crew biographies (notably regarding Armstrong's post-NASA teaching career) that don't dramatically detract from the book as a whole, but would be good to correct in future editions.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and salute David Shayler for writing such an outstanding book on such a critical program.	2005-03-20

This book is certainly more up to date than The Turkeys, and is of the same general ilk and demeanor.<br /><br />What I love about this book (and the Razzies in general) is the ability to skewer not only small, insignificant films like \\"The Creeping Terror\\" and \\"Devil Girl From Mars\\", but to take on hugely bloated yet unspeakably bad tripe like \\"Glitter\\", \\"Exorcist II: The Heretic\\", and \\"Spice World\\".<br /><br />Truly, this is a treasure trove of bad cinema and has given me many good (bad) suggestions for future viewing, as well as helping me plan future gifts for fellow movie lovers.<br /><br />If you have any interest in movies, especially if you love the bottom of the barrel so-bad-it's-good film, this book is a must.	2005-03-13

I do not think the \\"Controlling Pilot Error\\" series is all that strong to begin with, but this is unquestionably the worst offering in the series. David Frazier, a lifelong flight instructor, spends the vast majority of this book essentially trashing the reputation of other pilots (some of whom are dead). He is disrespectful at best and spiteful at worst. The book is filled with proofreading and grammatical errors (a common example is \\"pic\\" instead of \\"PIC\\", an acronym for Pilot In Command, hence the capitalization), and betrays his almost exclusive experience in light, single-pilot aircraft as he makes sizable mistakes almost every time he discusses situations that occurred in airliners.<br /><br />Frazier comes across as a self-important pompous crab who is jealous of anyone younger and more successful than himself. I'm not saying he is that way, but that's how he comes across. I know several other people who read this book, and they universally had the same observations. A prime example of ignorance and arrogance starts on page 93, where he discusses a Northwest crew that forgot to configure the aircraft for takeoff and subsequently crashed. It's obvious Frazier doesn't know much about airline operations, the MD-80, or taxiing in a busy airport, as almost everything he says is inaccurate. The crew was not joking (perhaps he was confusing it with a similar accident at Dallas; perhaps he should have double checked the NTSB reports before turning this in to the publisher...), they were very busy dealing with a complicated taxi reroute at night. If this were an isolated incident in the book it would be tolerable, but that is not the case.<br /><br />Frazier goes through a tortuous and ultimately fallacious discussion of soloing students in high winds. He chastises a new CFI for not soloing a student in high winds because he should have been taught how to handle the winds. Well, before the applicant takes his flight test, he will have to demonstrate competency in crosswind operations, but first solos are a major deal, not only for skills but for psyche: if an instructor doesn't feel comfortable soloing a student on any day for any reason, he is the one who has the best knowledge of the student's capabilities and should never be pressured to solo a student he deems not to be ready. (What is scary is that Frazier is the Director of Aviation at Jackson Community College in Jackson, Michigan. I know where my friends and family won't go to learn about flying.)<br /><br />Frazier also berates pilots who complain about long duty days. On page 114 he even says this about a CFI who had had an extremely long duty day, made an error, and wrote a very candid and professional report of his error: \\"He seems to me to be a poster boy for the me generation....And oh yes, he was tired from working a long day. Poor baby.\\" I would never work with or for someone who had this attitude. I wonder what the hours for a CFI at Jackson Community College are? I wouldn't want to work there. Later in the book he discusses an airline crew that attempted a takeoff with one engine left unstarted which the Captain attributed to a long duty day. Frazier seems to have no problem with that incident, but that just furthers my observation of huge internal inconsistencies in this book, and in Frazier's rationale.<br /><br />He discusses the Eastern 401 Everglades accident on pages 126 and 127, but didn't even know for sure where the accident happened (once again, maybe looking at the source material before writing is a good idea...). It is obvious that he only understands the accident in extremely general terms (I have a type rating on the L-1011 among other aircraft, and recommend against using this book for any airliner related information); he clearly does not understand the L-1011 autopilot, CRM, or ATC issues involved in the Eastern 401 accident.<br /><br />He wraps everything up with some safety tips which essentially boil down to \\"stay vigilant and avoid mistakes\\". The last paragraph of the book is OK, but that's the only paragraph of the book that even comes close to making the grade.<br /><br />This book is really pathetic in every way; I would recommend it to nobody under any circumstances. Now that I have written this review I am going to throw my copy in the trash, because I don't even want to give it away where it could be read again by an unsuspecting and trusting person.<br /><br />Utterly wretched.\\"stay vigilant and avoid mistakes\\".

Of all the books I have read on relationships, this one has the best, most applicable, most practical, and most comprehensible advice for couples (targeted particularly to married couples). In this book Gary Chapman explains his concept of the \\"five love languages\\" which are in a sense just the ways that different people give and receive love (and desire love to be demonstrated to them). He explains different viewpoints about love in relationships in a reasonable and graspable manner that anyone can understand, and of key import, he helps you determine your primary love language or love languages (some people like me have two). When combined with the love language of your partner, you can quickly see where things can potentially go asunder.<br /><br />Although he doesn't specifically recommend it as a premarital compatibility tool, I think that is perhaps one of the best uses you could make of this book. Hopefully you can find someone with the same languages you share, but if you can't you can at least know what to expect in future interactions with your intended spouse.<br /><br />This book is very simple and very easy to read (I read it easily in an afternoon), but it is also very powerful and helpful. Like most books of this sort, this is normally read by people in a struggling relationship, but I also recommend it for people in a healthy relationship (though perhaps less urgently) to try to improve what already seems great.<br /><br />This book was recommended by a trusted friend of mine; it sounded so useful that I ordered it the same night she told me about it, and read it the day after it arrived. I am so grateful that she recommended it to me: this book really opened my eyes on relationships in general and was right on target in my own personal experience. I am a skeptic by nature, but I recommend this book highly and without reservation to anyone in any kind of a relationship.his book highly and without reservation to anyone in any kind of a relationship. <br />	2005-03-13

The main character, Bat Boy, comes, of course, from \\"The Weekly World News\\" where he is a running character (most lately seen assisting Marines in Iraq). Here he falls for a young girl and love prevails (sort of) over the protests of just about everyone.<br /><br />The story is largely a comedy, but I think \\"tragi-comedy\\" is really more accurate. There are little jokes and puns everywhere in the script, and the songs are funny and well written. The show has one big shocker that most people won't see coming, so I won't spoil it, although it's a pretty grim little secret: not to fear though, the script is only 94 pages long, and is easily read in an hour, so your suspense won't last long.<br /><br />This makes a good companion to the soundtrack or play, but if you can, the best option is to simply go see this production staged somewhere: when done well it is a wonderful (if quirky) little show!	2005-03-13

While \\"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\\" weaves an almost believable tale of a double life as \\"Gong Show\\" host and CIA assassin, this book is somewhat less plausible, yet it is very fast paced and filled with several twists that I didn't see coming. My favorite part of Barris' writing style is his character descriptions. He is one of the best at genuinely painting a picture of the characters so they totally come to life and can be readily visualized. I was particularly amused by the descriptions of Coulter Bean and all of the villains.<br /><br />This book is foremost a first person spy novel, but also touches on a lot of other things such as aging and relationship traumas that are clearly more autobiographical for Barris. The interplay of the CIA assassin plot versus the aging TV producer are well balanced and poignantly nuanced.<br /><br />Although I still prefer \\"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,\\" I think it is worth five stars for sheer entertainment value. Great job, Chuck!	2005-03-05

The book makes some good general suggestions about diet and nutritional supplements, but I recommend that everyone discuss the implementation of these steps with their personal physician, as I did in the cases where I made changes, before implementing them. His advice is generally grounded in common sense, although I confess I am unsure about the functioning of some of the nutritional supplements he recommends (again, your doctor can help you here).<br /><br />One thing that caused me concern was his discussion of aspartame. Although I tend to believe that aspartame is not a health food (as I sit here typing and drinking my Diet Coke), I am concerned by a specific implication made on page 269 of the book. Broer makes the assertion that aspartame may have played a role in the crash of USAir Flight 427 in 1994 because the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) revealed the Captain discussing that he was drinking a diet beverage sweetened with aspartame ten minutes prior to the crash. His implication is that because he drank the aspartame he lost control of the aircraft and it crashed. He then goes on to say that FAA investigators confirmed that nothing was wrong with the aircraft. There are multiple problems with this. In the first case the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), not the FAA, investigates aviation accidents; secondly, the First Officer was flying the aircraft at the time of the accident; third, at the time the book was written the NTSB had reached no conclusions on the probable cause of the accident, but has since concluded that, in fact, the aircraft, a Boeing 737, was at fault (the aircraft had a malfunction of the rudder); and fourth, there is absolutely no evidence of any sort that either crewmember was not fully conscious and attempting to prevent the crash until the very end. In fact, the CVR revealed great evidence of higher cognitive processing and psychomotor skills during the last seconds of flight from both crewmembers. As an airline pilot with several years experience in the 737, I find Broer's implications to be totally baseless. My concern is that in this one area of the subject matter that I know much better than Broer, the author plays rather loose with the evidence to make his point. This may be intentional or unintentional, I have no way of knowing, but it does make me wonder where else in the book data contradictory to his position has been intentionally or unintentionally overlooked to make a point.<br /><br />Like I said, the book is largely a good resource with a lot of good and practical dietary and lifestyle information. I would have given it four stars except for the nagging issues raised by the aspartame section. I recommend this book with reservations. I would verify any major dietary, lifestyle, or supplement changes with my doctor before blindly following all the advice in this book.omotor skills during the last seconds of flight from both crewmembers.

US	52988732	R37H11PJ0MT2JK	0609805797	341629353	The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work: A Practical Guide from the Country's Foremost Relationship Expert	Books	4	29	32	N	N	Excellent And Practical Marriage Advice	Noted marriage researcher John Gottman has written a very good and practical book full of genuine insights into marriages, and specifically why some work and others fail. The book itself is of great use to anyone married, contemplating marriage, or on the brink of divorce. I recommend that the book be read even by people in solid marriages to prevent a future derailment, but of course the book will primarily be read by people in struggling marriages.<br /><br />The difference between this book and most other marriage counseling books is that it is scientifically and empirically based. Gottman debunks many myths including the myth that most divorces are the results of affairs; in fact he conclusively demonstrates that most affairs are symptoms of a failing marriage, and not the cause.<br /><br />The two best chapters in the book are chapters two and seven. Chapter two deals with predicting divorce (which he is quite good at) and presents sobering warning signs of pending failures as well as methods to cope with the specific problems. Chapter seven deals with the two types of marital problems, and was frankly why I bought the book: this chapter is excellent for engaged couples to read together prior to marriage. Gottman explodes the myth that all problems are solvable and can be dealt with using effective compromise: the sections on \\"perpetual problems\\" and gridlock are particularly insightful and helpful. I also found the afterword to be especially practical.<br /><br />The book is insightful, fact-based, and helpful for people contemplating marriage or in a marriage of any quality. I was torn between five stars and four, and eventually settled on four because I found a few of the exercises to not be especially helpful, but that is a relatively minor point; the text is worth five stars throughout, and I highly recommend this book.	2005-02-26

Mattsson, at the time a public affairs official with Swedish-American Line, tells the story of the \\"Andrea Doria\\"-\\"Stockholm\\" collision accurately and skillfully. People already familiar with the case will, no doubt, occasionally find hints of pro-Swedish bias in the account, but I believe that the book is overall quite objective and it fascinating to read.<br /><br />There are numerous excellent, rare photographs and illustrations as well as reprints of several important articles on the collision in the appendices. The only part of the book I really didn't enjoy was Chapter 19 \\"'Andrea Doria' v. 'Stockholm': an Imagined Conversation.\\" This chapter conjectures a conversation between lawyers of the two parties arguing the merits of their cases. The actual material is good, but the fictitious method in which it is written would have been better replaced by a factual recap of the legal arguments and opinions involved.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this book: it is a valuable edition in the library of anyone interested in the fates of the \\"Andrea Doria\\" and \\"Stockholm\\".	2005-02-20

He is a fascinating man, and got me interested in this very important story of early air logistics in the opening days of World War Two. The book does not disappoint. It is short and concise, but well written, well illustrated, and complete.<br /><br />The story concerns the Pan Am contract flying over Africa in 1941, and although it is a relatively unknown story, it is utterly fascinating to anyone with an inclination to historical reading. Although I know a lot about World War Two history, I must confess to having been almost totally ignorant of the valiant work of these contract employees and their contribution to the war effort. This book made me appreciate their huge undertaking in extremely austere conditions, and I recommend it highly.	2005-02-14

The eighth edition is very current with discussions of topics like JIT, JIT II, and early RFID technology (although much has happened in the last year in RFID, already making the text somewhat dated in that regard.) I found that the case studies were well written and the real world examples cited in the book were well conceived to illustrate the intended points. Learning goals and reviews were useful, and while I did not use all of the reviews, the ones I did use assisted my comprehension of the material.<br /><br />This book is great for an aspiring logistician or someone already in the workforce as a logistics or supply chain professional. This is definitely one of the best texts I have been exposed to in my graduate business classes, and I firmly believe that it would be equally useful in an upper level undergraduate class as well. I deducted one star not for any shortcoming of the book per se, but because of the outrageous price, which is, of course no fault of the author.	2005-01-26

I used the book as a text in a graduate school simulation class, and was fairly familiar with the material in advance as a long time simulation professional and instructor pilot. This \\"book\\" is really nothing more than a collection of unrelated scholastic articles of dubious value. Most of the articles are extremely old: one of the more up to date articles dealing with the importance of motion in flight simulation cited as prime sources studies conducted by TWA and American Airlines in 1969. To say that such material is dated is kind; to say it is wholly irrelevant is more accurate. (Some studies are a bit more current, but not by much; others are actually based on data collected in the 1930s and 1940s. Really.)<br /><br />Now a word on quality: the book is junk. To say that it is annoying to buy an expensive book which is very shoddily bound (pages started coming unglued and falling out on the first reading, others in my class had the same problem) is being generous.<br /><br />There is very little useful material even remotely relevant to modern flight simulation found in this book, and there are certainly better modern texts available on the subject (basically anything not written on papyrus will be more current.) This book is absolutely stultifying, and I still can't believe that any respected university would use this as a text book in 2005.<br /><br />If you have any choice in the matter whatsoever, do yourself a favor and skip this geriatric piece of tripe.	2005-01-26

Just when I thought that he could never top his wonderful (yet repulsive) \\"Gallery of Regrettable Food,\\" along comes \\"Interior Desecrations.\\" Quite simply, this is the only reference book you need about the 1970s. I grew up in the decade of matching sofas and wallpaper, and Lileks nails it here. I don't know where he found some of these photos, but they will make you howl with joy (but may make you scratch at your eyes, too.)<br /><br />The commentary is hilarious (planaria as a painting motif, Owl and the Pussycat idolatry) and everyone who has seen my copy of this book has wanted their own. If you want to look back at the ugliest single decade in human history, this is your textbook. I give this book my highest possible endorsement.	2005-01-12

I learned a lot from this wonderful book, which was a well-considered Christmas gift from my extremely exoptable best friend. One thing I learned is that I am rather devoted to gynotikolobomassophilia, as long as it is with the right person, of course! Unfortunately, on the down side, I occasionally suffer from bouts of onychophagy when under stress. (Sometimes I bite my nails.)<br /><br />This book is an absolute treasure trove of exotic vocabulary. Prior to reading this book, I knew what maybe ten percent of these words meant. To say that I have been enlightened and broadened is somewhat of an understatement. I did not know, for instance, that \\"fabiform\\" means \\"bean-shaped.\\" Likewise I was surprised to discover that \\"interbastation,\\" which sounds positively naughty, actually means \\"quilting.\\"<br /><br />Also amusing to me is the discussion of the typeface, a normally boring affair. Perhaps one reason I liked this book so much is because it is set in Galliard, \\"a type of solid weight, it possesses authentic sparkle that is lacking in most current Garamonds.\\"<br /><br />This is a great book. The entries are universally witty and obscure, and will be sure to please the bibliophile in your life. I could not recommend this book more highly.	2005-01-12

The music is very complex in many places, which makes it rather difficult for someone of modest ability to follow, but that is no fault of the book of course. On occasion the tablature is rather difficult to follow and sent me scurrying for a chord directory so as to figure out the proper fingering of some of the more advanced stuff.<br /><br />The product description says the book is hardback, but it is not: it is paper like most other books of this ilk. I gave it four stars for having a slightly misleading description. Overall, a great book for advanced guitarists (but a bit ambitious for less advanced players, like me) containing some of Knopfler's best solo work.	2005-01-12

This is my single favorite Edward Gorey book, partially because of the amusing couplets it is written in, but mostly because of the appearance of the guest himself, which never ceases to amuse me. The concept of a strange creature who mysteriously visits and decides to stay (seventeen years) while exercising odd whims (like fits in which he removes all towels from the bath or hiding inside a soup tureen) is particularly suited to Gorey's odd brand of humor (although it is not one of his more unusual books, by any stretch of the imagination.)<br /><br />I have liked Edward Gorey since I was in my teens, and still find him as unique and entertaining as ever. This is my very favorite Gorey book, and would make an excellent introduction to one of the oddest cartoonists of the twentieth century.	2005-01-12

I was fortunate enough to receive this gem as a gift, and must confess that despite a degree in Biology, there are facts about flatulence in this tiny book I had not previously realized.<br /><br />The book contains the basics of gas production, assigns labels to individual techniques for releasing it, provides a useful thesaurus for gas-related euphemisms (i.e. \\"step on a duck\\"), and quotations on the subject from a variety of famous individuals from Hippocrates to Lyndon Johnson. A typical example is this nugget from Benjamin Franklin: \\"What comfort can the vortices of Descartes give to a man who has whirlwinds in his bowels?\\" There is a slightly less acceptable section on flatus jokes (almost never funny), but that is more that compensated for by the phrasebook for several foreign languages including Afrikaans, illustrated by this example: \\"Ek het te veel blomkool geeet\\" (I've eaten too much cabbage.)<br /><br />I have to hand it to Alec Bromcie; he has illuminated the sulfurous art of maldigested complex-carbohydrate byproduct expulsion in an entertaining little book. I give him five stars for willingness to pursue this fetid subject when anybody else would have turned up their nose and retreated.	2005-01-01

I have used and enjoyed the other books in this series, and while other people prefer other guidebook series, this is my overall favorite series for Hawaiian travel. The author has an insider's knowledge of the island, and has written a book on Kauai that is full of useful information for travelers regardless of their individual interests.<br /><br />The information on beaches, areas of interests, and lodging options is without peer and is lavishly illustrated. People with more specialized interests will also find a plethora of useful information here; for example, there is an excellent and concise section on getting married in Kauai, among other details for those with special itineraries.<br /><br />This book is beautifully illustrated throughout and is printed on heavy stock paper. It is logically organized, easy to use both for planning and while on the island, and is current and topical. For anyone considering a visit to Kauai, this is a great all-around guidebook, covering both common and out of the way attractions. If I could only have one guide to Kauai, this would be it. I highly recommend this book.	2004-12-27

The book is generally shrink-wrapped in stores, so the contents are somewhat elusive; Amazon's price is great so I took a gamble on it. While there are some ideas illustrated in the book to recommend it, in general I am a bit underwhelmed. The book is full of color photographs (which are generally good, although the quality varies) but essentially no text. My biggest complaint about the book is that it has sections like \\"Fittings and Accessories,\\" which illustrates things like faucets, but rarely does the book tell you what you are looking at or even who the manufacturer is. The architects involved in the projects are generally referenced; in fact many of the bathrooms look like promotional photos for architectural firms. The strongest section of the book is the section on small bathrooms, which is good for a lot of remodeling projects that don't have a 500 square foot footprint to work with.<br /><br />The book is stylish with a clear plastic cover over very colorful illustrations, making for a unique effect. The book looks very cool, but if I had to do it over again, I would skip it and look for a book with more information on the materials and fixtures in the photographs.	2004-12-24

These tails allow them to move among trees freely, but unlike some reptiles they are not capable of caudal autonomy (that is they can't drop their tails for self-defense.)<br /><br />This book is a good guide to picking a healthy skink, housing it, and caring for it. There is an excellent section on group dynamics and social behavior as well as great detail on skink diseases including stomatitis, mites, and tail rot (which may require amputation resulting in a healthy \\"stump-tail\\" skink.)<br /><br />I purchased this book for a friend who is very enamored with skinks, but decided to first read it myself, as my collegiate background was in vertebrate anatomy (although I am primarily a mammologist.) The book is a very quick read (maybe an hour, maximum) but is filled with a lot of good information on skinks. I recommend this book for anyone interested in being a responsible skink owner.	2004-12-23

Vaughan, a sociologist, obviously worked very hard at understanding the field joint technology that caused the \\"Challenger\\" accident, and even harder at understanding the extremely complex management and decision making processes at NASA and Morton Thiokol.<br /><br />The book ultimately discards the \\"amoral calculation\\" school of thought (which she was preconditioned to believe at the outset of her research by media coverage of the event) and explains how an ever expanding definition of acceptable performance (despite prior joint issues) led to the \\"normalization of deviance\\" which allowed the faulty decision to launch to be made. The sociological and cultural analyses are especially enlightening and far surpass the technical material about the actual physical cause of the accident presented.<br /><br />This is a masterful book, and is impeccably documented. The reference portion of the book in the back is especially useful, in that she reproduces several key original documents pertinent to the investigation which are difficult to obtain elsewhere. My only objection to the book is the extreme use of repetition, which I think needlessly lengthened the book in several areas, and obfuscating sociological terminology like \\"paradigm obduracy\\" which not only fails to illuminate the non-sociologists among us, but makes for somewhat tortured prose.<br /><br />In praise of the book, however, it is a brilliant analysis of how decisions are made in safety-critical programs in large institutions. Chapter ten, \\"Lessons Learned,\\" is particularly noteworthy in its analysis and recommendations. It's a shame that managerial turnover has ensured that few of the \\"Challenger\\" era managers were still at the agency during the \\"Columbia\\" accident era. Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.<br /><br />This book makes for very weighty and difficult reading. Having said that, I highly recommend it to technical professionals, particularly engineers and managers involved with high-risk technologies. Likewise, it is absolutely imperative reading for safety professionals, consultants, and analysts./>This book makes for very weighty and difficult reading.

Goldberg is not a conservative firebrand, in fact he is philosophically more libertarian and describes himself as an old fashioned liberal, a point that most authors critical of the press can't honestly make. His advantage is being able to give first-hand testimony to actions of others in the media, and while this book was written before the enormous faux pas of \\"Rathergate\\" (in which Dan Rather used suspect sources prior to the 2004 election in an attempt to smear President Bush, which not only backfired, but further denuded the network media of credibility, not to mention possibly costing him his job) I have no doubt that Goldberg would be completely unsurprised by those events.<br /><br />The book is not simply a rehash of \\"Bias,\\" but goes further to the heart of big media bias, with many insightful examples of skewed reporting in the post-9/11 world, such as the mandate by Reuters that reporters not use the term \\"terrorist\\" to describe the 9/11 perpetrators (and other terrorists) evidently on the grounds that it is inflammatory and portrays them in a negative light (well, duh), demonstrating that liberal bias in the media is not restricted to the US. He also details the newest line of nonsense from the big media wonks, that there is actually a right wing bias in the media. As ridiculous as that premise sounds, it has recently been said many times, mostly since Fox news has become more popular. Goldberg does acknowledge some right wing bias at Fox, and although some have critiqued the book for not pursuing that lead further, I believe he handled it well inasmuch as conservative bias is not a central part of his thesis, and also because the Fox news audience is dwarfed by network news audiences.<br /><br />The book isn't perfect, and occasionally I detect a bit of a \\"noble martyr\\" tone in the book (even though that's true, modesty goes a long way) though it doesn't detract overall from the material presented. I highly recommend this book as well as \\"Bias\\" to obtain an inside view of the slanting of the news.

Not only is the book extremely current (it posts a 2005 copyright date), but the layout is easy to use, and it provides information that is actually useful in both planning a trip and once on the island.<br /><br />The book is well written, and is especially strong in the section on lodging. Without question the coverage of hotels in this book is superior to any other guide. The restaurant information is also informative, much better than other guides, but remember that no book can completely cover all the restaurants on the island. I have been to many of the places detailed in the book, and generally agree with the appraisals of the authors (the one exception being that I thought the Honolulu zoo was substantially better than the authors did). Even if you don't completely agree with every opinion offered in the book, every claim is well reasoned and nothing is completely out to lunch.<br /><br />This is the gold standard for Hawaii guidebooks, and I recommend it highly to anyone visiting Oahu!	2004-12-16

It is essentially a collection of quotations and short essays from famous people concerning George Washington. The book is divided into three sections, with the first devoted to thoughts of his contemporaries, the third is thoughts from modern thinkers, and the middle section devoted to everyone in between.<br /><br />The essays are informative, with the first section being the most important. It seems that now most people have an idea that Washington and the other founding fathers were a cohesive group of men who saw eye to eye on most important issues, but that is more a myth than reality. This book details some of the differences of opinion, particularly between Jefferson and Hamilton, and even includes quotes from people like Thomas Paine which are not particularly flattering to Washington. (In fairness, Paine held a personal vendetta against Washington in his later years which was not particularly objective or fair-minded.)<br /><br />This book is not an in-depth study of Washington, but is interesting and worthwhile reading. It is easiest to obtain from the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, the group that saved Washington's estate from ruin.	2004-12-16

The book is relatively current and topical, and to its credit covers not only Honolulu and Waikiki, but also the rest of the island (some other books shortchange everything outside the city, I find.)<br /><br />I like that the book provides off-the-beaten-path type information, but I do believe that the book is so compact that a lot of useful information has been left out, particularly in the categories of restaurants and lodging. The maps are, of course, fairly small (and black and white) so I recommend getting the excellent Lonely Planet map for island navigation, especially if you are driving.<br /><br />I think that overall this is a good guidebook, but the organization is sometimes difficult to use. That combined with the relative brevity of restaurant and hotel information caused me to deduct a star from my rating. Overall it is a good guide, and I certainly recommend it, although I have to give the more up to date \\"Oahu Revealed\\" guide by Andrew Doughty and Harriett Friedman the edge for user friendliness and completeness of commonly useful information.	2004-12-16
US	52988732	R2TJK0P3G9RUZD	0894640658	767222597	Introduction to Space: The Science of Spaceflight (Orbit, a Foundation Series)	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	Decent Introduction To Space	Thomas Damon's \\"Introduction to Space\\" is a good place to start for people who are generally unfamiliar with any of the basic principles of space flight. It is comprehensible any to interested person, and is generally geared toward a high school or early collegiate reader. The text is good at simplifying the math involved and in separating it from the text, making comprehension much easier for people who are not mathematically inclined.<br /><br />The book introduces most every aspect of space flight from the history of the US and Soviet space programs, to living in space. There are specific chapters that discuss orbits (although sparing the reader the math of an orbital mechanics book), space stations, the shuttle, space stations, astronomy, remote sensing, satellites, and even the potential for extraterrestrial colonization.<br /><br />I was required to read this book for a class, but think this book is really only suitable for a high school or early undergraduate course. (It would be ideal for a high school physics unit on space.) I have a fairly good conceptual background in spacecraft operations, and because of that found the book a tad boring, although it occasionally did teach me something I had not previously known. The book is clearly written, and seems factually quite good. I recommend it for anyone who needs a basic introduction to spaceflight, and who has no previous background in that area.	2004-12-06
US	52988732	R36V851YD9CS1M	1557787808	650199514	Environmental Case for Nuclear Power: Economic, Medical, and Political Considerations	Books	4	38	38	N	Y	Obviously Partial, Yet A Generally Good Effort	In this book Robert Morris does a generally credible job explaining the benefits of nuclear power. His book is factually accurate and informative, and particularly useful to people who have listened to extensive anti-nuclear rhetoric without attempting to hear the pro-nuclear arguments.<br /><br />While I agree with most of the points Morris makes, I do have a couple of quibbles with the book. The first is endless, mind-numbing repetition. I don't know how many times he says that 50,000 people a year die in the US from carbon-based air pollution, but you can bet it's a lot. The basic point here is that while that is likely true, repeating it every other page for 200 pages or so does not help make the case: this book needs editing. The second issue I have with the book is the presence of grossly inflated, yet trivial arguments. There is no question, for instance, that coal and oil use are air polluters; that is a valid point to make in this book. Where the logic gets stretched, however, is when he claims that because of all this air pollution (that would not be present with more nuclear power) that humans probably have more fatal traffic accidents because carbon monoxide makes driver reaction times longer, seems improvable at best, and ludicrous at worst. These are the two big criticisms I have of the book.<br /><br />While I believe his data on nuclear safety statistics, I do think that he overestimates nuclear safety features, and perhaps underestimates dangers. Safety engineering professionals study not only the accidents in an industry, but also the incidents that did not lead to accidents, yet could have. On this matter Morris is totally silent, and I think that detracts significantly from the scientific validity of some of his arguments: in other words, accidents are actually very rare, incidents more common. Since Three Mile Island the nuclear industry has become much better about sharing trend data, but this book leads readers to the conclusion that nuclear power is a 100 percent safe, utopian energy source. I personally agree that it is a generally safe source of power, and that the US would be wise to follow Europe's lead (for once) and develop more of it. Having said that, I also believe that nuclear accidents could potentially be quite dangerous, despite Morris' reassurances.<br /><br />Most of the low rating reviewers here are clearly in the anti-nuclear camp, and I think it's admirable that they read the book (if they actually did). I do question where most of them got their information; some of the armchair critics seem unclear on basic physics or other issues (like Uranium ore production, for instance.) One particularly offensive reviewer thought that this book proves that Morris was worse than Hitler and hated babies. My take on that: if you can't objectively criticize the book, you must not have anything important to say...frequently like the media establishment. It is clear that Morris' assertion that the media spreads a virulently anti-nuclear message is correct, probably in part because they are politically to the left in general, but more likely simply because it sells. For the same reason that you never see a headline reading \\"Jetliner Lands On Time After a Smooth Flight: Passengers Enjoyed A Light Snack\\" you will also never see a headline reading \\"Nuclear Plant Releases No Radiation; Nobody Injured; Electricity Produced At A Reasonable Price.\\" This is a differentiation that I think needs to me made, and while he attempts to make that argument in the book it falls a bit flat.<br /><br />While parts of this book are a bit overblown, and the book is clearly in the pro-nuclear camp, at least Morris makes his sympathies clear at the outset. I am glad that he wrote the book, and despite a few qualms about the presentation, I think it is worthy reading for anyone on either side of the nuclear debate, preferably in conjunction with the excellent and considerably more unbiased masterwork on contemporary nuclear safety organizations, \\"Hostages of Each Other\\" by Joseph Rees.y nuclear safety organizations, \\"Hostages of Each Other\\" by Joseph Rees. <br />	2004-12-02

This book is very thin, but is packed with generally very accurate and always extremely useful information as well as great color photography. This book is wonderful to use as a starting point for planning a trip to Iceland, and it is small enough to carry with you everywhere when you are there.<br /><br />The book provides an overview, geographic information, hotel, restaurant, and nightlife recommendations, and multiple road trips of varying lengths that see all the common sights and many that are substantially off the beaten path. These road trips are from one to four days endurance, and are very well designed from my experience, although I can't personally attest to the attributes of the ring road between Hvammstangi and Neskaupatadur. I can say that the southern routes, and the routes to Pingvellir and the Snaefellsnes peninsula are very well designed. My favorites of the tours are numbers three and four. The coverage of the Skaftafell National Park, Jokulsarlon glacial lake (a must see: take the boat ride), Hvannadalsshnukur, Kirkjubaejarklaustur (one of my favorite little towns), Porsmork, and Stykkisholmur is particularly good. I was also amused by the coverage of the Vesturfarasafnid a Hofsofi, the only museum in the world that focuses exclusively on herring. (Iceland is known for many similar oddities, and that is one reason I love it so much.)<br /><br />My only minor critiques of the book would be that the index is rather sparse, and some of the hotel and restaurant information (and a few prices) are out of date (which is to be expected.) One thing the book entirely failed to mention in the money section is that most businesses will take Icelandic kronurs and also US dollars.<br /><br />This is a great little introductory tour guide to Iceland, with the emphasis on brevity and utility.

I read it and generally found the information to be rationally presented and logical, although ultimately mostly improvable. The truth of the matter is that I don't know if this book cost Kerry the election, but it certainly didn't help him, and to that end the Senator really didn't help himself.<br /><br />I would have liked to see Kerry respond to the allegations within this book more directly during the campaign. For instance it would have been inordinately helpful to have Kerry own up to the fact that while he served honorably in Vietnam (for which I salute him), his actions immediately after the war (especially with regards to other veterans) were a tragic mistake. It would have been good to have him proudly claim his medals, while clearly communicating that he received only superficial wounds in the case of all his Purple Hearts; candor would have been refreshing. Likewise it would have been helpful for Kerry to actually correct once and for all his account of the March 13, 1969 Bronze Star action (an event that he has given a minimum of three versions of publicly). While he was at it he could have admitted that he never spent Christmas in Cambodia (which even his supporters began to admit prior to the election), and give an accounting of why he circulated that story in the first place. This isn't to second guess Kerry's campaign, but rather to admit that this book brings to light several inconsistencies in Kerry's positions over the years that would have been helpful to have directly addressed.<br /><br />The book was largely written by John O'Neill, who once worked for Richard Nixon, which bothers some reviewers. Working for Nixon does not make him wrong any more that hating Bush makes Molly Ivins right. This book makes many allegations, and I honestly wish we knew the truth; I gave the book four stars for asking important questions.<br /><br />In at least one respect I completely agree with the authors: given the democratic position that all Bush Air National Guard records needed to be turned over, I find it scurrilous that they were not equally indignant that Kerry has steadfastly refused to sign Defense Department Form 180, which would make all his military records public. I don't know why he has refused, but it is reasonable to be suspicious: after all Bush signed DD 180, and it stands to reason that if the information within his military records was universally glowing he would have rapidly made the contents public. For this reason alone, I tend to give O'Neill's vision some credit: I just would have liked to know the truth; ultimately John Kerry could have told us, and no matter what was in the records, I think it would have helped his perceptions in the \\"red states.\\"he democratic position that all Bush Air National Guard records needed to be turned over, I find it scurrilous that they were not equally indignant that Kerry has steadfastly refused to sign Defense Department Form 180, which would make all his military records public.

I have been to many of the parks, and without exception the book's advice about how to get there, when to go, what to look for, etc., is excellent in every way. The book is filled with excellent color photography, and accompanying explanatory text with detailed entrance information that is particularly useful in some of the busier parks. There is also some good introductory safety information presented, but as always, it is a good idea to talk to local authorities when arriving (this is especially a good idea in the Alaska parks, many of which are veritably full of bears.)<br /><br />All the parks are worth seeing, and this book gives a good introduction to them. Among the favorites that I have been to and particularly recommend are Denali National Park, an easy drive from Anchorage, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, on the island of Hawaii (the \\"Big Island\\"), Zion National park in Utah, home of some of the most spectacular desert landscape in the world, and Badlands National Park in South Dakota, featuring not only spectacular landscapes, but amazing animals in abundance.<br /><br />This book is a great place to start; now get going and enjoy the beautiful National Parks!	2004-11-30

The sparseness of maps and total absence of photographs (although they do manage to insert a color glossy advertisement for American Express) really hurts this book. New Zealand is a unique place and deserves substantially more detail than it receives here. Interestingly, Fodor's also publishes a book titled \\"Fodor's Exploring New Zealand\\" which is quite good, provides much better coverage of matters of interest, and has numerous excellent color photographs. Of the two, I would definitely opt for \\"Fodor's Exploring New Zealand,\\" which is a much more user friendly and informative guidebook.<br /><br />The best feature of this book is the \\"Smart Travel Tips\\" section which briefly summarizes important travel information about New Zealand travel, such as driving and flying information, money, mail, and tax laws, etc. This section is at the very beginning of the book and is really the only reason to even consider purchasing this book as the information in concise and crucial to travelers. Most of this information is available in other, better, guidebooks, though. Because of the deficiencies in other areas of this book, I recommend either \\"Fodor's Exploring New Zealand\\" or another guidebook.	2004-11-30

Beginning with the thoughtful introduction, Doubilet and Boles showcase some truly stunning American homes, demonstrating the lasting value and societal insights that mark great architecture.<br /><br />Without question the greatest architect featured in the book is the master of overlapping pure geometric shapes and planes, Richard Meier. Perhaps his greatest work is his stunning Grotta House, which just might win my vote for most beautiful private residence in the US. He is also featured in a piece of earlier work, the Hoffman House, which has since been modified by two of his proteges. Also interesting for its geometry, but more for its combination of materials is the Pacific Palisades House by Charles Gwathmey. Of great geometric interest are the Dan House by the brilliant Franklin Israel, and the stunning Lawson/Westen House by the genius of geometric manipulation, Eric Owen Moss. These homes are national treasures, are well illustrated here, and are also well explained by the enlightening text.<br /><br />There are a couple of clunkers in the mix as well, namely the horrid deconstructivist monstrosity on Martha's Vineyard by Steven Holl. After looking at the illustrations and grasping that he was inspired by ancient use of whale bones as a building method, I appreciated why nobody builds houses from whale bones anymore. The Knee Residence finished in large maroon panels and small windows appears more like a prison than a single family home. Although I actually do appreciate the intriguing structural techniques used in these two homes, I cannot appreciate their lack of aesthetic refinement.<br /><br />My only critique of the book as a whole is that the house plans are extremely small and difficult to read. This is a minor complaint, as overall I think this book, like the homes it illustrates, is a masterpiece.a masterpiece. <br />	2004-11-29

This is a companion to Sullivan's earlier book of the same format on the Apollo CSM. If you have read his CSM book, you know how detailed it is, and amazingly this volume is even more detailed.<br /><br />The book has a general history of Apollo and the LM program, with particular emphasis on the flight mode quandary, and the ultimate decision to use Lunar Orbital Rendezvous (LOR) for expediency, a move that in retrospect seems obvious, but dramatically altered the Apollo program.<br /><br />This book is a mostly a compendium of incredibly detailed drawings of all components of the LM in extreme detail. The book is so detailed that there is no way a person can absorb all the information in one reading. Both the H and J series spacecraft are detailed, as is the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV, which in my opinion is Boeing's single best piece of engineering work ever.) This volume also comes with a CD of numerous images and files of great interest to an Apollo historian, including Adobe files of the Apollo Operations Handbook for the Lunar Module (volumes one and two), which basically comprise the flight manual for the LM. Think twice before you start to print these two documents, by the way, as they are about 1,800 pages long in combination.<br /><br />My only complaint about this book is that the entire book (including the text) is printed in landscape format, which makes it much more difficult to read as text is fairly close to the spine. I also sometimes disliked the use of false-color drawings (used to illustrate different materials or complex mechanisms), but Sullivan did an admirable of using color photographs to show the same areas on various Lunar Modules. This book is an Apollo treasure trove, and space program enthusiasts will love it.	2004-11-28

This is a children's book about a man who marries a vacuum cleaner named Elektra; the wedding is unusual considering that the bride wears chrome wheels, a dust ruffle, and a grapefruit sized diamond engagement ring at the end of her hose. The marriage sours on the very first night as Elektra runs off with a woman's husband, who happens to be a lawnmower.<br /><br />The book is written in rhyming couplets (which frequently don't have very good meter, as if the kids will care), and is certainly original. The moral appears to be that humans should not marry machines. I bought this as a gift for a friend who also happens to be a vacuum cleaner aficionado; I am certain he will enjoy reading it to his daughters, although I am less certain of their reaction.<br /><br />The book is certainly unprecedented, but given the enormous number of children's books to choose from, this one really isn't particularly entertaining or educational in any way, although the drawings of the vacuum cleaner with facial features (Is it a seven foot nose or a hose?) are wryly disturbing. In other words, it isn't emotionally scarring for life, but it isn't Beatrix Potter, either.<br /><br />This is a most peculiar book.	2004-11-28

The book is written with a historical perspective on the Apollo program that not only discusses the technology, missions, and hardware of Apollo, it also discusses the political underpinnings of Apollo as well. That is all relatively common, though; the thing that sets this book apart is that it also covers the physics of rockets, orbital mechanics, and trajectories in a comprehensible manner that most casual readers have not been exposed to. He also gives excellent summaries of the Apollo 1 fire and the Challenger accident, as well as observations on the shuttle, future planetary exploration, and John Glenn's shuttle ride.<br /><br />The book is interesting for both aerospace professionals and newly interested readers as well. In the body of the book, for instance, he discusses the basic math behind Newton's laws and required thrust (which accompanies an especially well written section on staging) without resorting to extravagant mathematical proofs, however for the more avid reader he defines the calculus based proofs in the appendix. This writing technique makes the book an excellent choice for an intelligent non-expert to read as an introduction to the Apollo program.<br /><br />I found this book to be quite accurate, and found his conclusions to be generally very sound. I don't universally agree with every opinion he shares in the concluding part of the book (he essentially contends, for instance, that John Glenn's shuttle flight was apolitical, an opinion I don't share, and in which he is definitely in a tiny minority), but I find his reasoning to be excellent overall. My one critique of the book would be that the last third or so of the book dwells on the shuttle, Mars missions, and other future programs (some of which are very far out.) I am sure that Mr. Allday would say that past is prologue, and that those programs form part of the perspective mentioned in his title. I don't dislike the information; I just found some of it less than germane to the Apollo program.<br /><br />This is an excellent, accurate, and interesting book, which I highly recommend to any space enthusiast.form part of the perspective mentioned in his title.

I am extremely choosy about compilations of comics, but have to go on record as highly recommending this volume. \\"Dilbert,\\" while normally enjoyable, has some true standout strips, and this is a collection of Scott Adams' personal favorites with handwritten notes by Adams about each one selected. There is no question that Adams hits the nail on the head regarding personnel in modern American companies, and touches on everything from the ridiculous and grotesque management compensation packages (My favorite of that ilk concludes with underpaid Intern Asok complaining \\"I make my own underpants from sandwich bags.\\"), management by cliches, pointless corporate reorganization and departmental name changes (I am particularly familiar with this one.), outsourcing (I love the Elbonians.) and Adams' (and my) personal pet peeve, \\"Management by Analogy\\" which has management saying something absolutely stultifying to employees while not ever recognizing their own gaffe.<br /><br />I highly endorse this book.

This book features a wide variety of superior architects, but in some cases not the best works by those architects; for instance the book features one of my favorite European architects, Ben van Berkel and his splendid Mobius House, but then follows up with one of his aesthetically least pleasing works ever, the dreadful semi-subterranean Villa Wilbrink, a conscious affront to suburbia located in the Dutch suburb of Amersfoort.<br /><br />I have always been a fan of Finnish architecture; unfortunately it is somewhat underrepresented here. Despite that shortcoming, the one Finnish selection (the Double House in Espoo, Finland) by the Helsinki firm of Gullichsen Kairamo Vormala is a splendid example of constructivist school philosophy tempered with rationalist emphasis on economical construction based in part on prefabricated structures.<br /><br />Alongside the Espoo house, my other favorites in the book are all Spanish and Portuguese, with the Cap Martinet House on Ibiza and a beautiful Portuguese home by renowned modernist Eduardo Souto de Moura being the best examples of southern European modernism displayed in the book.<br /><br />There are a few structures that while interesting structurally, were aesthetically unacceptable to me as they were extremely avant-garde modifications of century old structures which shortchanged both old and new; chief among these offenders is the House Kada B in Leibnitz, Austria, in which a beautiful blue home built in the 1800s had an enormous brown box attached to it in a most unstately manner. Second offender is the Cristoph Mackler home addition onto a sixteenth century Lake Constance home. I am actually a fan of the new structure, and think Mackler is brilliant, but the juxtaposition between the two structures is visually distressing to say the least.<br /><br />All in all this is a great book worthy of being in any architectural library. I gave it four stars for some home selections that I thought were sub par, for an under representation of Scandinavian architecture (some of the most creative, innovative, and beautiful in the world), and especially for the extremely tiny house plans that you actually need a magnifying glass to read.r />All in all this is a great book worthy of being in any architectural library.

This is a surreal little dictionary containing many definitions as strange as the one in my title. Many of the \\"definitions\\" refer the researcher to another book (that is normally even more obscure than this one), and many use the word as part of the definition itself. By the way, I had to look \\"besom\\" up in a real dictionary, and discovered that a besom is a broom made out of twigs, which means that a heather-besom is a broom made out of heather twigs. (I guess.)<br /><br />Geordies are people from the industrial city of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in England. Originally the term only referred to local coal miners, but now generically refers to anyone from the region. The term started derisively and was derived from the name of King George III, who went completely out of his mind and was widely disliked. Fortunately, the term can now also be used affectionately, and simply connotes a person from around Newcastle.<br /><br />For English linguists familiar with the area, the dialect is an interesting study as it is a peculiar evolving dialect with many terms and pronunciations not found anywhere else in the world. Geordies can be very difficult for other English speakers to understand, in fact. This book was written in an attempt to give meaning to many of these idiosyncrasies, and while useful, falls short. For starters, the words are generally phonetic spellings of dialectic pronunciations, like \\"nowt\\", which is defined as \\"nothing\\", but would be correctly spelled \\"naught,\\" of course. (I wonder if famous Geordie Mark Knopfler would have had a hit with a song titled \\"Money For Nowt\\"?) The second obvious problem is that many entries refer the reader to another super-obscure book, normally Heslop's \\"Northumberland Words\\" (from 1892!) or Geeson's \\"Northumberland and Durham Word Book,\\" which is at least from the twentieth century (1969). Good luck finding either of those.<br /><br />The words themselves are frequently defined by examples, which is a bit useless at times. The entry for \\"plodge,\\" for instance (which means to wade in water with bare feet) contains this illuminating example: \\"Along the sand we myed wor way, like plodgers on a rainy way.\\" For further information readers are counseled to see a book by a man named Wilson titled \\"Tyneside Songs,\\" published in 1890.<br /><br />Despite these annoying tendencies, there is much enlightenment to be gleaned from this book, and if you are really interested in the Geordie dialect (and especially historical Geordie dialect), this book is one of the few choices available to you that has been printed within the last 100 years. Some of my favorite definitions are: \\"skyet-gob: fish face;\\" \\"hawkie: a white faced cow;\\" \\"gowk: the heart of a plant, especially an apple;\\" \\"faallen wrang: become pregnant;\\" \\"choke-damp: the result of an explosion of fire-damp in a mine;\\" \\"claggum: coffee made with treacle;\\" \\"scumfish: to choke with smoke;\\" and finally the least likely of all, \\"corporation: the stomach.\\"<br /><br />This is a small book, locally published in Newcastle in the series of \\"Northern History Booklets\\" by Frank Graham (which also includes titles such as \\"The Vindolanda Jewellery,\\" and \\"Buses of Northumberland and Durham.\\") \\"The New Geordie Dictionary\\" is a sincere little book, and although it does have faults is one of the best books on the subject, and is certainly among the most accessible.s.

This is a book that will appeal to U2 fans of all types, but particularly musicians interested in their work. The book consists of a brief narrative, lyrics for the songs from \\"Achtung Baby,\\" and musical transcriptions and guitar tablature for each of the songs on the album.<br /><br />The photographs (both black and white and color) are excellent and truly capture the mood of this excellent album, as does the narrative and the selected quotations from the band members.<br /><br />The guitar parts are well defined and easy to read, and are, to the best of my ability to discern, quite accurate. Particularly outstanding are the transcriptions of \\"One\\" and \\"Love Is Blindness,\\" although I may be a bit biased, as those are also my two favorite tracks on the CD.<br /><br />This book is great for any U2 fan, but is especially great for fans who are also musically inclined; to those in either group I recommend this book.	2004-11-24

The book features several excellent color photographs of Mark Knopfler and the band, lyrics to the songs, and music tablature for the songs. The musical transcription is excellent, and any quick glance will tell you that this is difficult material to play. Of course while some of the solos are transcribed, some of the fadeouts (obviously including the extremely long concluding soloing in \\"Telegraph Road\\") simply state \\"Repeat with ad lib. treatment till fade.\\" This is generally irrelevant anyway, as only an incredibly talented guitarist could think about duplicating the solos.<br /><br />Songs covered are a mixed bag of good to great, and include \\"Sultans of Swing,\\" \\"Down to the Waterline,\\" \\"Portobello Belle,\\" \\"Twisting by the Pool,\\" \\"Tunnel of Love,\\" \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" \\"Where Do You Think You're Going?,\\" \\"Walk of Life,\\" \\"Private Investigations,\\" \\"Telegraph Road,\\" \\"Money For Nothing,\\" and \\"Brothers In Arms.\\"<br /><br />This is a good book, but remember that this is very difficult material, and you will need to play it finger style.

In reality I would like to give this guide 3.5 stars, but will have to settle for four. The photography is generally good, and the information is generally correct in my experience. This book features some excellent pointers that are especially good for those new to Hawaii. The book has a brief background section on the islands as a whole, and has decent island by island coverage of all the major Hawaiian Islands (certainly all the ones a tourist would visit.)<br /><br />My only real critique of the book is that with a length of just over 200 pages, it is not terribly complete given the diversity of the Hawaiian Islands. The hotel (and restaurant) listings are generally accurate, but are not complete, resulting in the situation where some fairly well known and sizeable properties are overlooked, which can be extremely annoying if you happen to be booked in one of those properties. This is by far the biggest drawback to this book.<br /><br />My take on the situation is that this is a good book for finding things to explore further in Hawaii, but when it comes down to detailed planning, I recommend that you consult other guidebooks; I particularly like the Lonely Planet series of guides, which has offerings for all the islands that you will be interested in visiting, albeit with less captivating photography.	2004-11-24

This volume features many excellent color pictures of Mark and his guitars, a very interesting interview in which he discusses the advantages of being a lefty that plays right-handed (among other topics), and of course note-for-note transcriptions of some great (mostly earlier Dire Straits) Knopfler songs. These transcriptions are definitely the best available, but because they are very accurate remember that they are extremely complex.<br /><br />The songs featured in this volume are \\"Sultans of Swing,\\" \\"Once Upon a Time in the West,\\" \\"Expresso Love,\\" \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" \\"Tunnel of Love,\\" \\"Love Over Gold,\\" \\"Private Investigations,\\" and \\"Telegraph Road.\\" Amazingly enough the transcription includes an accurate rendition of the extremely complex and lengthy closing solo on \\"Telegraph Road,\\" which I have never seen anywhere else.<br /><br />This is the Knopfler music book to buy for musicians and fans alike.

Not only is this map detailed and current, it is logical and complete. There is an overall map of Oahu, and several smaller inset maps of key places including Honolulu, Waikiki, Kaneohe, the Mokapu Peninsula, Laie, and Mamala Bay (including the huge Ala Wai Harbor). The Honolulu map is very detailed and continues far enough to the West to cover the airport and the publicly accessible parts of Pearl Harbor. Note that this map, unlike many others, uses the traditional Hawaiian spellings complete with accents and pronunciation marks, which makes it the ultimate in accuracy, although when comparing it with many more anglicized works, the spellings may differ slightly.<br /><br />This map is without question the best overall map for navigating the sometimes very convoluted (and busy) roads of Oahu: if I could only take one map to Oahu with me, this would be the one. I highly recommend this map to anyone traveling to Oahu.	2004-11-23

For what it is, it is excellent. The map is a laminated, accordion-fold map of the portions of Oahu and Honolulu that most people want to visit. It is a great size and format, but would be even better if it was just a bit shorter to make it better able to fit in pockets. The only reasons that I gave it four instead of five stars is that not all Honolulu is depicted, making it less than totally useful for exploring out of the way places (although it does cover Waikiki and downtown Honolulu well, redeeming it largely), and the scale is generally so small as to be difficult to read, especially while driving, the exceptions being the downtown Honolulu and the Waikiki maps, which are altogether excellent and very user-friendly.<br /><br />I do recommend this map to people visiting Hawaii. It will be perfectly adequate for 99 percent of all tourists, but if you plan on venturing beyond downtown Honolulu or Waikiki, you need to consider a more comprehensive map. The single most useful map for most travelers to Oahu is the Nelles Maps edition titled \\"Honolulu and O'ahu,\\" which I recommend highly. The only drawback to the Nelles map is that it is a full-size fold-out map, making it a bit unwieldy at times; therein lies the reason that I use both the Lonely Planet and Nelles maps, this map is best for on the go, quick reference use, while the Nelles map is best for trip and route-specific planning.	2004-11-23

A much better overall alternative to this map is the Nelles Maps \\"Honolulu and O'ahu\\" map. It is not specifically as useful for bus riders, but for most travelers, it is perfect: detailed, user-friendly, and complete. Unless you only care about bus travel, I recommend the Nelles map instead.	2004-11-23

This book has an admittedly narrow audience but it you happen to be of Norwegian (or Swedish) descent, from Minnesota or the Dakotas, a Lutheran, from a farm, or a fan of Edvard Munch's \\"The Scream\\" you will undoubtedly find this little book very amusing. The authors discuss the cultural conflicts of Munch versus traditional Midwestern farmhouse art, ultimately attempting to finish Munch's incomplete \\"Frieze of Life\\" via comedic cartoons featuring the character from \\"The Scream\\" in typical upper Midwest scenes.<br /><br />The characters have good Norwegian names like Einar and Ingeborg, and frequently exclaim in Norwegian tinged English, which is more true to life than most people who are not from the area realize. The situations are funny in a kind of surreal way, and involve everything from school and meal preparation to bass fishing and tractors.<br /><br />Is it good? You betcha! The book is generally quite entertaining, but being from one of the demographics listed in my introduction will definitely make it more personally amusing to readers. I give the book four stars for being quirky and peculiar and for taking Edvard Munch to places he has most definitely never been before.	2004-11-23

All these new activities are strangely suggestive, but not what most people would actually call pornographic; after all, the book is only illustrated with Gorey's discreet little drawings.<br /><br />The sofa itself is contained in a room lined in polar bear fur, is upholstered in scarlet velvet, and has nine legs and seven arms;  when the machinery starts within it Alice shudders and the book concludes in a delightfully ambiguous manner, in what may well be one of the strangest endings of any of Gorey's books.<br /><br />I like Gorey, and this is a good little book, but is not actually one of my favorites, as I think there are others more whimsical, and a few are even stranger. For Gorey lovers this is a great little book, but understand that it is quite small, which makes it a questionable value, particularly in light of the excellent compilations available.	2004-11-21
US	52988732	R3B3H46YCECK7Y	0375421505	82593719	Lost in Space: The Fall of NASA and the Dream of a New Space Age	Books	2	6	14	N	Y	Pointed Ax-Grinding	When I purchased this book, I expected a thoughtful analysis of managerial and oversight failure. I am supremely disappointed to report that in this book NASA can do no right. I approached this book with my own opinions: NASA has lost focus, has lost funding, and has lost the technological edge. Much of this has been due to political hacks running their pet pork through NASA and ignoring NASA's real mission, all the while cutting funding for programs to levels where virtually nothing can be effectively accomplished. I wouldn't say that Klerkx disagrees with that point of view per se; he does appear, however, to have a major ax to grind with management.<br /><br />In the view of Klerkx, it is time for NASA to let loose the reins of manned spaceflight, and allow private corporations go into space on their own. He presents his case that NASA stifles competition at every juncture while making his claims of incredible capitalistic prosperity in space. What he then goes on to claim, in an irresolvable paradox, is that NASA needs free market competition in manned spaceflight, but that because the required investment is so huge, no private company could afford it. His solution involves privatizing the shuttle and ISS. So let me see if I have this straight...he wants the US to foot the bill to develop manned spaceflight capabilities, but then just give it away? He doesn't say it quite that bluntly, but a large portion of the book details essentially that viewpoint.<br /><br />He tends to vilify many NASA managers, some deservedly (like Dan Goldin), and some not. He also embraces some of the most arrogant and obnoxious of all the alternative space gurus, particularly the seemingly insufferable Robert Zubrin, although to his credit, he does adequately detail the personality conflicts that go everywhere Zubrin goes. He also adulates the Space Hab on Devon Island as doing extremely valuable research for Mars preparation. It may be fun to dress up in toy spacesuits and ride ATVs around in the arctic mud, but I hate to break it to you, Greg: Mars isn't like Devon Island, and this is basically Space Camp for ubernerds.<br /><br />High on my list of issues with the book is the willingness to accept any data presented by the alternative space movement while simultaneously disregarding much of NASA's data. He repeats the mantra of low cost access to space endorsed by the alternative space movement that a truly low-cost, reusable vehicle is feasible, with claims of costs as low as $500-$1,000/lb for orbital insertion, versus $3,000/lb on a disposable launcher and $10,000/lb on the shuttle. I guess he wasn't paying attention in the early 1970s when the Nixon, Ford, and especially Carter administrations were preaching this exact same miracle of cost effectiveness for the shuttle.<br /><br />Another theme permeating the book is that \\"normal\\" people should fly in space at a reasonable cost. Towards the end of the book, he even espouses the view that shuttle passengers don't really need training to go into orbit with the convoluted reasoning that 777 passengers don't need to know how to fly the plane in an emergency. That's true: of course neither do the shuttle payload specialists know how to fly the orbiter. At a half-billion dollars per launch, I think it is only responsible of NASA to expect that everyone onboard is put to some productive use. (This goes hand in glove with the adulation of Dennis Tito that runs throughout the book.)<br /><br />The closing chapter is the weakest of the bunch, a trend which other reviewers have also noted. It essentially combines a lot of platitudes about the future with no concrete recommendations on how to help NASA (though there are a few pie in the sky theories aired.) There are lots of things I would like to take NASA to task for, notably the huge lack of focus in the shuttle and ISS, but at least I am willing to admit that NASA has strengths too, a virtually unimaginable concept to Klerkx. Only in the last pages of the book among much adulation for the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute does the real motivation of Klerkx become evident. In a passage dealing with the cancellation of the DC-X (which actually was a shame) he laments that the Stockholm Institute claims that in 2001 the governments of the world spent $772 billion on defense (although many institutions not as politically far left estimate a much lower figure.) Klerkx is dismayed that US spending allegedly accounts for a third of that, and laments this waste (without mentioning, of course, that the US provides about three quarters of all the world's peacekeeping forces.) His true colors as an anti-government, anti-military leftist become apparent, and make his vehemently anti-NASA stance then appear for what it is. The best illustration is the following passage which speaks for itself: \\"It may well be that one of the best, and most optimistically subversive, uses of military spending is to pursue better, cheaper and more reliable spacecraft. After all, the $60 million the military spent on the DC-X...kept at least $60 million from being spent on bombs.\\" It finally all makes sense: Klerkx spends the whole book railing on government based development programs, then complaining when they are cancelled; the truth is he wants the government to pay for the development and hardware, and then give it all away. I'm sorry Mr. Klerkx: the real world doesn't work that way. (Heaven forbid the military would have anything to do with it, after all they only sponsored most of the programs, including the shuttle in part.)<br /><br />The book gets two stars for presenting some interesting information, but if I had to do it over again I would have never bought this book or wasted my time reading it. NASA has problems, but none are as big as the holes in this book.or the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute does the real motivation of Klerkx become evident.

The book focuses on general history, operators, and color schemes (and contains numerous excellent color photographs), with a few rudimentary technical notes thrown in. There is also an excellent production list, and a very brief summary of accidents. Potential readers should note that although the book was up to date when published, it is through no fault of the authors, decidedly not current now due to rapid post-9/11 fleet plan changes at many of the airlines listed as operators.<br /><br />The technical portions of the book are generally accurate, though several errors are present. There is also an interesting tidbit in a section titled \\"In Service\\" in which a Captain Jack Brown makes assertions about the B-737 versus DC-9 that I find highly questionable. I have flown the B-737 with a major US airline, and have also flown the DC-9, although I am not sure if Brown has. To say the least, I find his statements comparing the B-737 to the DC-9 less than complete, particularly his claim that the B-737 outperforms the DC-9, on among other things, fuel consumption. (I don't for a second believe that, and if he has the Specific Fuel Consumption data on equal Airspeed/Mach profiles to back up his claim, I would surely like to see it. At any rate, for full disclosure, I flew the B-737-200 for two years and considered it to be unquestionably the worst commercial aircraft I have ever flown.) Captain Brown also dismisses the problem of rudder hardover lightly, although in fairness, at the time of writing the NTSB had not issued the final reports on US 427 and UA 535. I don't take the rudder hardover issue lightly at all. I am grateful that all B-737 aircraft are now being modified as the result of an Airworthiness Directive, although the FAA gave Boeing and operators a very generous time frame to make the modifications. I suffer no illusions that the only problem with the rudder is in the yaw damper, and to their credit the authors do discuss the significance of problems in the B-737 Power Control Unit (PCU), which is a major point of journalistic fairness in favor of the book, as it predates the final NTSB rulings in question.<br /><br />The section on accidents is a study in brevity, but there is quite a bit of detail on two accidents, the British Airtours engine explosion, which is generally well covered, and the Air Florida accident, which contains several errors, including uncorroborated, unknowable assertions about crew attitudes, lack of understanding of routine NTSB investigation protocols, and strangely, an apparent misunderstanding of how Engine Anti-Ice works on the B-737 (and almost all other jet aircraft.) The book alleges that a heated fluid is circulated around \\"the air intake and induction areas, and the PTT [sic] probes.\\" In reality, hot air (from the engine's 8th and 13th compressor stages) is directed into the engine cowling, bullet nose, and guide vanes through three valves to warm the area including the PT2 probe in the bullet nose assembly. (For you technical purists, there is a small amount of area continuously anti-iced by the circulation of warm engine oil which flows through the inlet guide vane at the six o'clock position. This oil goes to lubricate engine parts mounted under the bullet nose. This detail is really not germane to the accident.)

The book alleges that a heated fluid is circulated around \\"the air intake and induction areas, and the PTT [sic] probes.\\" In reality, hot air (from the engine's 8th and 13th compressor stages) is directed into the engine cowling, bullet nose, and guide vanes through three valves to warm the area including the PT2 probe in the bullet nose assembly. (For you technical purists, there is a small amount of area continuously anti-iced by the circulation of warm engine oil which flows through the inlet guide vane at the six o'clock position. This oil goes to lubricate engine parts mounted under the bullet nose. This detail is really not germane to the accident.) My point here is that people who want technical information on the B-737 should look elsewhere. Hobbyists, people less interested in technical data, and people interested in operators, color schemes, and history of the early B-737 should enjoy this book. <br />	2004-11-14

Despite the omnipresence of vacuum cleaners in our lives, very little is written about them. This book is an excellent history of vacuum cleaners and their predecessors, brooms, Bissell sweepers, and carpet beaters.<br /><br />The book explains the formation of dust and various methods of removing it from our homes. It also teaches kids about dust mites and allergies, and emphasizes cleanliness. Obviously the accomplishments of the great H. Cecil Booth, the inventor of the first practical vacuum cleaner, and James Murray Spangler, the man who invented the beater bar (although it was originally a rotating brush made of goat hair) are highlighted. Also detailed are the rise of the mighty vacuum industrial giants, Hoover, Kirby, and the Swedish company Aktiebolaget Elektrolux, better known as Electrolux, the first manufacturer of the canister vacuum cleaner with wheels. Many novel vacuum cleaners get mention, including bellows powered models, and one powered by coal.<br /><br />The book discusses current technology vacuum cleaners including dustbusters, \\"bugvacs,\\" a French animal refuse vacuum, and a vacuum cleaner specifically designed to vacuum prairie dogs out of their holes on ranch land. The book adds excited mention of the Hoover Historical Center in North Canton, Ohio, a museum devoted to vacuum cleaners, with over 100 on display.<br /><br />Finally, the book has step by step directions for kids to follow to make their own vacuum cleaner. It also has a glossary and index, which is extremely rare in a book of this kind.<br /><br />This is the best book for teaching children about vacuum cleaners, or possibly about household appliances in general. It is well illustrated, and stresses the importance of cleanliness and helping parents with chores (obviously including vacuuming.) I recommend this book for parents of kids curious about machines in general and vacuum cleaners in particular.is book for parents of kids curious about machines in general and vacuum cleaners in particular. <br />	2004-11-13

It has sections on toilet history (Thomas Crapper, interestingly, did not actually invent the toilet, but apparently purchased the patent for it), toilet humor, and quotes about toilets from such luminaries and Rod Serling, Joey Bishop, and Lyndon B. Johnson (which certainly seems appropriate). The book also covers commode trivia, a section of toilet haiku, and a concluding \\"pottyscope\\" feature that divulges horoscope information for each star sign that is sure to intrigue you (if you happen to be a raving lunatic.) Mine, for instance tells me that as a Leo my bathroom is luxurious and first rate, with a padded, expensive, electrically heated seat, and that I use scented rose oil as an air freshener. As with most horoscopes, there is one small nugget of truth in this prediction, but I'll never tell which nugget it is. This book is a perfect sticking stuffer for the oddest person on your Christmas shopping list.	2004-11-11

The quote is symbolic of the entire book for me, in that it tells the casual reader little by itself, but forms part of the overall tapestry of odd facts, trivia, stories, and downright weird vocabulary that together make this book a delightfully entertaining, informative, and insightful read.<br /><br />In preparation for this book Bryson visited Australia several times, and covered an amazing (some would say crazy) amount of territory, most of it far, far off the beaten path. I greatly admire his characteristic ability to put interesting sights into historical perspective, although in my mind, he never really did answer the conundrums he posed early in the book about the Aborigines. I particularly enjoyed the sections devoted to the amazing ecosystem of Australia (and the subsections on the amazing number of things in Australia that can kill you), the number of silly museums and sites (\\"The Big Lobster\\") Bryson visited, and most charmingly of all, the seemingly endless topic of curious (if not downright eccentric) people that call themselves Australians.<br /><br />This is a great book, which I recommend highly to anyone interested in Australia. My only minor critique of the book would be its occasional redundancy (I understand it is hot, and that the Outback is large after the first one hundred or so mentions, for instance), but this is a small price to pay for an otherwise exquisitely entertaining travelogue.<br /><br />I have always wanted to visit Australia, and after reading this book, have redoubled my resolve to go there (despite the number of things waiting there to kill me.)	2004-11-11

He also mentioned that the class was open to all students from all backgrounds and though calculus was not required for the course, it would help. I'll say so. I had quite a bit of calculus in college (although that was several years ago), and while I could generally follow the discussions in this text, some of the mathematical assumptions and thought processes were at times difficult for me to work through.<br /><br />The point to be made about this book is that while it is ostensibly an introduction to space flight, do not be fooled into thinking that it is casual reading: it is very rewarding reading, but is not easy. The text is very lucid, well thought out, and thorough; while the mathematical reasoning is generally logical, some assumptions are made that are not always evident to non engineers.<br /><br />Most people reading this book will be engineers with a recent college math background, and it is a perfect book for that audience. I enjoyed reading the book as well, but had to take my time with the mathematical reasoning fairly routinely. I give the book four stars because while perfect for collegiate engineering students, it really is a bit in depth for a more casual reader with a less rigorous mathematical background. For narrative excellence, though, the text can't be beat. Recommended to any interested engineers or to any interested party with exposure to (at a minimum) calculus of a single variable, although this book is not particularly suitable for armchair space enthusiasts.	2004-11-03

This is my second favorite of all Gorey tales, behind only \\"The Doubtful Guest.\\" The story concerns Embley and Yewbert, who, after hitting each other with croquet mallets, have quite an adventure on the bicycle in question.<br /><br />One of the beautiful things about Gorey is the number of interpretations that are possible. In all likelihood no two people will take the same thing away from his stories, which immeasurably enhances the reading experience. As in all Gorey tales, this one contains extremely peculiar turns of phrase, and this one has the bonus of seemingly randomly numbered chapters, although it took me three times through the book before I noticed.<br /><br />This is a delightful introduction to Gorey, and is one of his distinctly less macabre stories. This book is wonderful fun for all ages and is highly recommended.	2004-11-03

In the front of the book are small regional maps showing the location of the depicted drives, and in the main body of the book are details about the drives with specific directions and sights to look for.<br /><br />Many travel guides show interesting destinations, but few can compare to this book for showing beautiful routes, sometimes far more breathtaking than the destinations themselves. The directions are generally clear and the color photography is first rate throughout. I subtracted one star, though, for a conceptual issue that I think weakens the book to a degree. Most of the routes start in isolated areas far from a major city. For travelers from other regions, it is sometimes difficult to deduce the way to the starting point (many starting points are simply crossroads) and from the ending point of these routes. It would be a notable improvement (especially for unfamiliar travelers who fly to a major airport to start a driving vacation) if in the third edition the editors put brief directions to the starting points from major cities in the general area. I would like to give the book 4.5 stars, but Amazon doesn't allow that, so I settled for four.<br /><br />This is an excellent vacation planning resource and I recommend it highly.	2004-11-02

I bought this book the day it came out, and eagerly began reading it, only to have my eagerness rapidly turn to disappointment. Wagener is clearly writing on subject matter far outside his field of expertise, and commits many mistakes, misspellings, and factual inaccuracies to paper in this book. I was exasperated when Wagener constantly referred to Neil as a \\"jet ace\\" in Korea (he does not know what the term actually means, apparently), but was really appalled when he kept calling the \\"Lunar Module\\" the \\"Landing Module.\\" The point to be made by these two (of many) examples is that if these are the errors I caught, how credible is the remainder of the book? How many errors did I miss? Surely the most egregious gaffe is putting the famous lunar photo of Aldrin on the cover of the book. I don't know why the publisher didn't have an astronaut or pilot review the manuscript for accuracy, but that would certainly be an excellent idea before a second edition is published. I am surprised that astronaut Bill Pogue, a relative contemporary of Armstrong, would endorse this book on the back cover.<br /><br />To his credit, Wagener attempts to chronicle Armstrong's entire life from childhood to the present, and does manage to include a lot of relatively unknown information on Armstrong. I am sympathetic with the author's plight, in that while not a recluse, Armstrong is an intensely private man, which makes material and background information infinitely more difficult to gather. Obviously this is not an \\"authorized\\" biography with participation from Neil, but does cite several friends and acquaintances of Neil in the text. The pre and post Apollo 11 information is most interesting, and is the best work in the book. I have no doubt that the general storyline of the book is correct, but wish that I could find corroboration for some of the information presented here.<br /><br />Certainly there are many better books on Apollo, if that is your primary interest: I particularly recommend books by Chaikin, Cunningham, Collins, and Lovell (who, amazingly, the author wrongly blames for the Apollo 13 accident) for very engaging accounts of the Apollo program, and the excellent Apogee Apollo Mission Reports series for technical information. Unfortunately if you want a biography of Neil Armstrong, you are pretty much stuck with this one. Hopefully sometime in the future a historian with a gift for writing will gain Armstrong's confidence and a genuinely authoritative biography will result; Neil Armstrong is an American hero and frankly deserves better than this.on for some of the information presented here.  <br /> <br />Certainly there are many better books on Apollo, if that is your primary interest: I particularly recommend books by Chaikin, Cunningham, Collins, and Lovell (who, amazingly, the author wrongly blames for the Apollo 13 accident) for very engaging accounts of the Apollo program, and the excellent Apogee Apollo Mission Reports series for technical information.

The book places anti-Americanism in historical context in five separate free-standing, yet mutually supporting essays. The book is difficult reading given the number of references to obscure writers, philosophers, and activists who are little known outside extremist European political circles.<br /><br />Each chapter deals with some different aspect of anti-Americanism, and chapter five also discusses the parallels between anti-American and anti-globalization rhetoric in Europe. The best chapter is chapter three, \\"Democratic War, Repressive Peace\\" in which Berman discusses the fundamental logical problems and lack of factual basis supplied by leaders of the anti-American movement, or as the author succinctly states in the first page of the chapter: \\"Drawing on long-standing cultural conditions rather than on contemporary conditions, anti-Americanism is trapped in a world of imagination. It is ideological in the sense that the ideals to which it adheres are never tested against hard facts.\\" Numerous examples are cited to prove his assertion, and the chapter is probably the single most concise indictment of the hypocrisy present in the anti-American movement in Europe that I have yet seen.<br /><br />The book lost a star for chapter five (on anti-globalization), which becomes a tangent to the book more that a topical discourse on anti-Americanism per se. He also spends quite a bit of time on the writings and political views of Arundhati Roy, a bombastic Indian anti-American propagandist. Although she is read more in Europe than in the US, her influence seems blown out of all proportion to her actual relevance, which is essentially nil.<br /><br />This is a good and noble effort, although I think that \\"Anti-Americanism\\" by Jean Francois Revel is a better overall book, and is certainly more readable.	2004-10-30

That would be a tragic mistake. This book is eminently readable, funny, and human, and best of all requires no knowledge of calculus or particle physics to understand or enjoy.  <br /> <br />Richard Feynman was one of the truly great minds of the twentieth century, and his lectures are considered some of the most important works of hard science to date by the overwhelming number of physical scientists in the world. This book discusses physics in language accessible to most anyone, yet has an urbane sophistication and sense of humor about it that is able to entertain a wide variety of readers. I recommend it to anyone who wants to look inside the world of a genuine genius. Inside that world they will discover insights about science, music, societal values, the educational system, and much more, while simultaneously skewering pompous blowhards who feel superior to others due to education or upbringing.  <br /> <br />Truly Feynman was a genius for the masses; this is my favorite of his books, but I recommend them all.	2004-10-28

Much has happened in the aerospace world in the intervening time, and virtually none of the forward looking predictions made by the authors have come to pass in even general terms, except on an obvious and hugely macro scale such as avionics developing faster than airframe design.<br /><br />The book itself is an acceptable introduction for very casual readers with little background in aeronautics. It should be skipped by anyone in an aviation profession. Unfortunately I was required to read this book for a graduate class, in what I can only hope was a ghastly textbook selection error by the instructor (I would say this book is comprehensible to suitably inclined junior high school students.) I read the entire book in less than three hours and learned essentially nothing of value from it.<br /><br />The information is old (the authors still refer to the B-777 in the future tense) and many of the concepts advanced (especially on the civil aircraft side of the house) are pie-in-the-sky concepts, impractical and unfit for the real world (like the cargo plane so huge that it can't land on runways so it will instead land on an air cushion, bizarre flying boats, oblique wing aircraft with wing spans over 500 feet, etc.) Even if these ideas were practical and possible (I believe some are possible, but none are practical) the market for such aircraft would be so small as to render them commercially untenable.<br /><br />My bottom line appraisal of \\"Future Flight\\" is that there are a few nuggets of interesting (although common) information in this book, but students or professionals who want a real-world overview of the future of aviation with appropriate technical details need to find another book.	2004-10-21

In this volume Gaddis, a Professor of History and Political Science at Yale, analyzes the changes made in foreign policy under George W. Bush and places them in historical perspective.<br /><br />Gaddis reminds readers who have forgotten their history that as a result of the War of 1812 during which the British burned Washington, DC to the ground, it was (then Secretary of State) John Quincy Adams who instituted a three-pronged strategy to protect the United States from surprise attack. The lynchpins of the strategy were preemption, unilateralism, and hegemony. This strategy served the US well from the War of 1812 until it was fundamentally changed by FDR in 1942 in a multi-lateral response to the Axis powers of World War Two. In the case of the FDR policy shift, the decisive surprise attack was, of course, Pearl Harbor. The Adams doctrine essentially comprise the policies the George W. Bush administration has reverted to, much to the consternation of multilateralists and UN wonks.<br /><br />Gaddis finds that the FDR doctrine of multilateralism was appropriate during World War Two, although allied relations were mishandled, particularly at Yalta. These errors in dealing with the Soviets would eventually set the Cold War in motion.  The policies of international interdependence remained basically unaltered throughout the Cold War because of a phenomenon Gaddis describes as an \\"asymmetry of legitimacy\\" in which the world was divided into two spheres of influence. Most countries saw the US as the more desirable ally (excepting the majority of dictatorships in the world), i.e. the Soviet Union (and communism) was generally considered anathema. The influence of the US grew throughout the Cold War, with the consent of the allied countries. The Soviet Union also expanded, without ever having such consent. The decision by the US to abandon preemption and unilateralism during the Cold War helped decide the ultimate fate of the Cold War, and expand democracy around the globe.<br /><br />Gaddis is highly critical of the Clinton administration's collection of ad hoc decisions on terrorism posing as strategy, and particularly points out differing approaches between Bush and Clinton. The Bush administration has stated their policy on terrorism as \\"We will defend the peace by fighting terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.\\" Gaddis compares this with policies laid out in Clinton's last national security policy in 1999, which simply listed three priorities: \\"To enhance America's security. To bolster America's economic prosperity. To promote democracy and human rights abroad.\\" Gaddis correctly analyzes the significant differences between the two and finds that while Clinton speaks in lofty goals, the statements are nonspecific and assume peace as a given, which it obviously is not. Bush clearly sees the need to defend peace and forcefully promote American security. An interesting point is that Bush seems positively multilateral (and of course there are numerous other countries fighting with the US in Afghanistan and Iraq, despite what the Bush detractors try to assert), but makes a point of engaging with the major powers. This clearly makes the point that under Bush, the US need not accord countries like, for instance, Kenya, equal say in alliances. (This is exactly how the UN has deteriorated into a third world debating society.)<br /><br />Gaddis supports the foreign policy of George W. Bush, making it clear that since the US has extremely open borders and is no longer protected by geographic isolation, a policy of preemption when dealing with fanatics is required (and obviously bigger intelligence budgets will be needed), and a willingness to act unilaterally if necessary and not subjugate security to the UN (which has done a manifestly unsatisfactory job of managing security in even the tiniest of states in the most minor of conflicts) is a necessary corollary. This Bush doctrine takes the US back to the policies of John Quincy Adams, policies that largely kept the US secure for 130 years.<br /><br />Gaddis closes with a story of a lecture at Yale. He was discussing Lincoln, who called America \\"the last best hope of earth.\\" Gaddis believes that is still true, and I agree. This is not a universally popular notion in academic circles, particularly in liberal arts in the Ivy League. The ensuing discussion must have been fairly lively, but an amazing thing came out of it. An undergraduate student stood up and said \\"I love this country. I love this place. I love what we're doing here tonight. I love it so much that I'm prepared to defend our right to do it, which is why I'm joining the Marines. It's people like me who make it possible for people like you to be here doing what you're doing.\\" Never have truer words been spoken.

These papers were taken from a conference held in Gottingen, Germany in 1977. The papers are generally excellent, with a couple of exceptions. I have given the collection four stars because in 2004 some of the work is now a bit out of date. I would encourage all scientists, students, and professionals involved with marmosets and tamarins to obtain and read this volume. It is particularly strong on marmoset behavioral issues and hand-rearing techniques. When I was in school, I concentrated my biological training on mammology, and was particularly interested in lemurs and South American primates, particularly the Golden-white Bare-ear Marmoset, the Black-and-white Tassel-ear Marmoset, Snethlage's Marmoset, the Black-chested Moustached Tamarin, and the Cotton-top Tamarin. Unfortunately, these species are fairly obscure, and are largely overlooked in this study in favor of the more well known Common Marmoset and Golden Lion Tamarin.<br /><br />I was particularly interested in the articles of taste stimuli in different Callitrichidae, and found the comparisons of taste thresholds of saccharin between varying marmosets and humans to be particularly enlightening. I also found M. F. Stevenson's behavioral work on ritual lip-smacking, allogrooming, piloerection (including the \\"bristle\\" pattern, sometimes involving ear tufts, sometimes not), and body posturing and gestures (including the extremely rare \\"bared teeth gecker,\\" which was only observed once in a male being chastised by a female, leading me to inquire if this phenomena is exclusive to short tusked marmosets). Stevenson also presented some interesting work on marmoset diet, particularly the portion of marmoset nutrition made up by gum resins from certain trees.<br /><br />My only complaint in the series of articles is the paper written by J. C. Ingram of Bristol titled \\"Infant Socialisation [sic] Within Common Marmoset Family Groups\\". This article was illustrated by very difficult to decipher sociograms of family interactions of two different-sized marmoset family groups. The diagrams tend to be almost impossible to comprehend and seem to present information best presented in other types of diagrams. This was also a problem in some of Rothe's binary tables (using Sozcka's method of cluster analysis) which appear to contain valid, but extremely difficult to decipher data.<br /><br />Despite the shortcomings of age (and a few shortcomings of data presentation), I highly recommend this volume to mammologists in general, and particularly those involved with marmosets and tamarins.hin Common Marmoset Family Groups\\".

I really wanted to give this book four stars, but I just can't in good conscience. The author is an English Professor at Costal Carolina University, and for the sake of full disclosure, is a former colleague and friend of one of my best friends. Hamelman takes every opportunity to prove or reinforce his central thesis, which essentially is that America is a disposable culture and this is mirrored in the throwaway nature of rock music. In other words, rock music is the music of waste. Among my problems with the book is the self-aggrandizing pseudo-scientific analytical tone in the book which entirely fails to take into account other relevant or contradictory pieces of evidence. For example, a central problem for me is essentially ignoring rock's black roots with the sole exception of Hendrix. There are also questions of scientific objectivity in the ponderous section on landfills. I am not defending needless waste here, but the author goes on and on about all the stuff that is discarded without considering the entire environmental picture to make his point. Hamelman goes on at length about how many cars we discard in the US every year without mentioning that virtually all cars are recycled (over 90 percent). He also talks about disposable diapers like they are a scourge. The truth is that the phosphorous used to launder cloth diapers would be hugely more environmentally destructive than throwing away disposables. He alleges corporate greed as the reason behind using plastic jewel cases instead of environmentally friendly cardboard (which cuts down trees) because the cardboard is 60 cents more expensive. Earth to Steve: if the production uses cardboard the consumer pays that cost, which may not sound like a lot but amounts of billions a year; secondly the primary job of the jewel case is to protect the CD, which it does measurably better than cardboard. I don't have a personal stake in this (other than not wanting to pay more for CDs encased in flimsy cardboard), but I do care about valid and logically correct conclusions.<br /><br />Hamelman falls into a trap so common in academic writing: the assumption of correctness. There is also a 1960s-centric view of the rock world: if you aren't a Baby Boomer you aren't really qualified to judge the body of rock as a whole, in other words. Dave Barry once fell in this same trap, much to his detriment.<br /><br />I really wanted to give the book four stars because I thought that his central thesis and supporting arguments were interesting and (possibly) correct. As a scientist by education, I had problems with Hamelman's scientific methodology. The biggest single issue is presenting assertions as facts on which his arguments are then built. This is particularly true in his discussions of love and death in part two of the book. The conclusions from a logically correct argument are not necessarily true if the premises are false.<br /><br />Other areas in the book that I take exception with are Hamelman's offensive and inappropriate comparison of Jesus and Hendrix. The author is, of course, entitled to his own opinions, but I personally find Hamelman's arguments about rock music being an adequate system of morality (and a replacement for God) to be illustrative of the morally bankrupt rock culture he so dearly loves. This all from the same author who admires Yo La Tengo (who I have seen in concert, much to my everlasting disappointment) and is apparently obsessed by, of all people, Lou Reed. I have to question any author who continuously refers to the greats of rock with references to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Reed's Velvet Underground. He seems particularly smitten with later Reed work, namely \\"Berlin\\" (thank goodness it wasn't \\"Metal Machine Music\\") which he explains in grand speculative interpretations for pages on end.<br /><br />In the positive column, Hamelman does explore uncharted territory, withinteresting and at time logical proposals, although sometimes his evidence is anecdotal and sketchy (he points out that if you take the first three letters of \\"trash\\", you can rearrange them to spell \\"art,\\" for instance.) I like the development of the art as trash theme, and think that there is support for his arguments, although the final two parts I found to be on vastly more dangerous logical grounds. I generally agree with Hamelman that most rock music is disposable, but with many exceptions, which tend to weaken his arguments. I still listen to the Beatles, Dire Straits, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Led Zeppelin. I think that these examples alone (among many more) tend to refute the \\"rock is trash\\" argument. Some rock is trash, some is not. Hamelman need not worry: history will sort out which is which.<br /><br />The best section of the book is his chronological list of his \\"Trash Top Forty,\\" a truly inspired labor of love that for me makes the book worth reading by itself. Certainly Hamelman had to listen to a lot of very bad music to make this book a reality, yet I believe that despite all the effort, there is a biased focus on 1960s rock, punk, and grunge (he is especially enamored with Kurt Cobain.)<br /><br />Candidly, this is an interesting but ultimately fairly inaccessible effort. There is interesting analysis to be pondered and boatloads of information to digest, but it is all cloaked in academic over-verbosity, which will be an enormous turn off to the majority of readers. One reviewer likened this book to \\"London Calling\\" by the Clash. Due to the ponderous writing style and academic pretension inherent in this book, I think of it more as \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" by Emerson, Lake and Palmer. I recommend this book only to serious academic students of music history.interesting and at time logical proposals, although sometimes his evidence is anecdotal and sketchy (he points out that if you take the first three letters of \\"trash\\", you can rearrange them to spell \\"art,\\" for instance.)

The book starts with a history of the Arizona including modifications made to the ship current up to the attack. Also provided is an overview of the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 and the significance of that attack on the American psyche. These sections are concise, factually accurate, and interesting to read, but will likely not expose any new or vital information to serious historians of the Pacific War.<br /><br />The real originality of material here concerns the archeological record of the Arizona, and the seldom visited Utah, the only other vessel sunk during the Japanese attack (out of 30 vessels sent to the bottom of Pearl harbor that day) that is still resting in Pearl Harbor. The dives undertaken by a joint force of divers from the US National Park Service and the US Navy to document the conditions of the two ships are amazing in scope and detail. Several detailed maps of the wrecks are produced on fold-out pages in this book. These illustrations and maps are invaluable to historians, as anyone who has been to the memorial knows that only a very limited amount of detail of the Arizona is visible from the surface. (Even less of the Utah is observable from the surface.) As part of these studies experiments designed to measure the estimated rates of corrosion (and, hence, remaining life) on the ships were undertaken. These efforts are detailed in the extensive section titled \\"Biofouling and Corrosion Study.\\" This chapter is of critical importance to preservationists and historians in plotting conservation strategies for these shipwrecks, bearing in mind the complicating fact that the Arizona still entombs approximately 1,000 sailors, and the Utah still holds around 50.<br /><br />As a result of these studies it was determined that over 99 percent of the Arizona is encrusted with a diatom/detritus mat of plant and animal life, particularly sponges, large Feather-Duster Worms (Schizoporella errata), vermetid mollusks, Sagebrush Tube Worms (Salmaoina dysteria), and Colonial Feather-Duster Worms (Branchiomma cingulata). There are a total of ten taxa of fauna and five taxa of flora that comprise the bulk of species present on the wreck, although many more have been identified in minor quantities including barnacles, snapping shrimp, numerous types of sponges (especially erect and encrusting species), Orange Soft Coral (Telesto riisei), Wood-Burrowing Bivalves (Martesia striata), sea squirts of several species, and various mantis shrimp and oyster species. Additionally, there are numerous fish living and nesting on the Arizona, including the Cardinal fish, the Parrot fish, the Burrow goby, the Mongoose fish, the Goat fish, the Sordid Damsel fish, the Balloon fish (whose eggs have proven particularly destructive to some portions of the Arizona), the Gold Butterfly fish, and the Raccoon Butterfly fish, just to name the most significant. For those interested in further hard scientific explorations, there are many other topics discussed including sedimentation and water oxygenation studies, oil escape and entrapment studies, and a fascinating set of bathycorrometer measurements, which are conveniently summarized in table form.<br /><br />There is an additional section on management of the site, which reveals great insights from two former administrators of the landmark. This section is vital reading for anyone interested in underwater landmark administration.<br /><br />This book is profusely illustrated, and was obviously meticulously and painstakingly produced. It is immense value to underwater archeologists and preservationists, historical site managers, biologists, and serious historians of World War Two.

US	52988732	R210J7HTLGHYBO	0972456244	71466576	Close to the Sun	Books	3	5	5	N	Y	Good For Political Intrigue, Weak On Aviation Knowledge	As a pilot who has flown all the Boeing airliners except the B-707 and the B-777, as well as the A-320, I was intrigued by this book, although in the end it was not exactly what I expected. My preconceived notion that this book would be rather technical was proven decisively wrong, yet I have given the book three stars for good background information on the formation and machinations of Airbus. In particular the sections devoted to the political intrigue of the British on-again, off-again approach to the consortium (and the resulting consequences) was especially good, and gave me a fresh appreciation for the good judgment exercised by Margaret Thatcher during the debate about the A-320 wing construction, and the positive effect it had for her policy of privatizing British industry. For a political history of Airbus this book is an excellent resource.<br /><br />While the book may be excellent in dealing with the politics of Airbus, it is poor in evaluating technical aviation information. Aris repeatedly makes horrendous technical and terminology errors which tell me he does not grasp any of the underlying technology of flight, and is particularly ignorant of how Fly By Wire (FBW) actually works. He continuously makes the grating error of saying that conventional aircraft, including the entire Boeing line, have \\"joysticks\\" to control them, for instance. This is of course exactly wrong, they have control yokes; the controversy when the A-320 was introduced was in fact precisely because Airbus was deleting the yokes for side sticks (or if you must, \\"joysticks\\"). This entire section of the book is muddled by his improper terminology: an unknowledgeable reader would conclude that it was actually Boeing that had sticks in their products. This is perhaps the worst, but is not the only, technical gaffe in the book. I noted numerous misspellings (including of airline names) and imprecisely worded statements which will lead some readers to improper conclusions. Likewise, in his section on A-320 technology, he leads the casual reader to believe that the pilot is just along for the ride, which is totally incorrect. The A-320 has a lot of slick, very useful technology, but it operates as it is directed to by the pilots at all times (with the exception of some pre-programmed envelope protection features outside the scope of this book or review.) In discussing Airbus accidents, he makes the unfortunate error of technologically lumping the A-300, A-310, and A-320 into the same group, which is blatantly incorrect from a flight control point of view. He likewise has either not read, or certainly has not understood, the factual accident reports concerning the early A-320 mishaps. Be cautious, in other words: do not take the information presented here for fact unless confirmed elsewhere.<br /><br />I sometimes wonder about Aris' research techniques given the construction of many sentences in this book. Very frequently he quotes the author of other books verbatim, with introductions like \\"...in the words of [author's name]....\\" I would find this appropriate if dealing with unique references or technical data, but it is generally taken from other books written by laymen for laymen. While there is nothing technically wrong with this, as he does give appropriate credit, I am simply saying that given the relative shallowness of the material involved, he could have seemingly conveyed the information in his own words: I paid to read his thoughts, not those of others I have likely already read.<br /><br />While some people have dismissed this book as Airbus propaganda, I think it is better than that. I do think that Aris favors Airbus over Boeing (and frankly, so do I), but I do think that he attempts to be fair to both sides in general, and gives Boeing credit where credit is due for the most part (sometimes I think too much credit, in fact.) If anyone gets the short shrift here it is Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas, who come across as blundering corporate idiots with their trijet programs, which dramatically over-simplifies the situation as it actually existed in the late 1960s and early 1970s. At that time, for instance, Extended Twin Operations (ETOPS) was not even conceived of: aircraft needed a minimum of three engines to fly more than 60 minutes from shore, clearly making the idea of a widebody twin less appealing. In fact, the trijet was a great idea: the market was just not able to support two similar designs. Interestingly, Lockheed had desired to build a twin engine version of the L-1011, but the engine technology of the time didn't allow an engine of sufficient thrust.<br /><br />This book is worth reading, but principally for the political intrigue involved, and for some of the interesting information on dramatic sales campaigns waged by Airbus; particularly the Eastern, Pan Am, and Northwest campaigns. For information of a technical nature, go elsewhere. Overall I recommend \\"Birds of Prey\\" by Matthew Lynn as a superior Airbus versus Boeing text, although it was written considerably earlier.corporate idiots with their trijet programs, which dramatically over-simplifies the situation as it actually existed in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The book combines fascinating text, highlighting his years of professional knowledge, with amazing color photographs, to yield one of the most breathtaking large-format architectural books I have ever seen.<br /><br />Most stunning in this book is the photography. The breadth of buildings photographed is amazing, and all developments in modern architecture including minimalism, post-modernism, European rationalism, and deconstructivism are well covered. I particularly enjoyed the sections on megastructures, world cities, and populist architecture. I noted that London seemed a tad over-represented, but I didn't mind as the examples showcased (The Ark and The Circle, for instance) were so interesting. Also displayed heavily is the deconstructivist Bernard Tschumi, whose Parc de la Villette is modestly interesting, but who otherwise seems a bit more conventional than his reputation would tend to indicate.<br /><br />My favorites in the book include all the works by Michael Graves, particularly the Benacerraf House Addition, and Ken Yeang's Menara Mesiniaga Tower in Kuala Lumpur, which is a peculiarly skeletal, yet overstated building. Of course there are many other wonders in this book, and I highly recommend that anyone with an interest in contemporary architecture buy it today.	2004-09-22

This little book written by a top breeder of longhairs (and who is married to a veterinarian) is enormously useful for people new to longhaired cats. I generally agree with the author on most issues (although I think more behavior is breed-linked than she does), and find this book most useful in the pre-cat ownership stage. She has an excellent section on considerations necessary before adopting a new cat.<br /><br />Her advice and information is presented in an easy to understand manner, but most of this will be known by experienced cat owners already. People who have never owned a cat before (and particularly those considering a Persian or other longhaired cat) should definitely read this book. If you have had cats for a while, there is probably little new information to be learned here, although many of the illustrations are nice. One key to take away from this book is that while longhairs may look more glamorous than shorthair cats, the upkeep on a longhaired cat is significantly greater, particularly in the grooming department. Having said that, I think they are totally worth the extra effort.<br /><br />She discusses longhairs and breeds (I am partial to neutered male Persians and Maine Coons myself), but emphasizes that all cats are individuals with unique personalities. I agree with her, but want to add my own comment on top of hers: if you want a pet, you will gain nothing by having a pedigreed cat (in fact they may be less healthy because of greater inbreeding, though not necessarily). Having said that, please consider rescuing a cat from your local shelter. If you want to show or breed the cat, she gives some basic information on this as well.<br /><br />Cats make wonderful companions, and I highly recommend this book for those interested in getting their first cat, while more experienced cat owners can probably safely skip it, although it still makes a nice reference.e. <br />	2004-09-20

While it is true, as one reviewer points out, that most of this information is available by phoning the schools in question, that seems to be missing the point: in this one book all the information that a prospective student needs to begin their graduate school search is in one place. That, in a nutshell, is why this is valuable.<br /><br />The book has profiles on essentially every school in the US with graduate programs, including many I had never even heard of. The profiles explain what programs are available, admittance requirements and procedures, costs, addresses, phone numbers, contact personnel, etc. All the information is extremely well presented and genuinely useful. While I am sure that there are small errors in a book this comprehensive (just like there are errors in any 700-plus page book, be they grammatical or otherwise) this is a great resource for basic research into a school or program. Obviously, when a student has accomplished this first step, they will need to go to individual school websites, talk to schools, and ultimately visit campuses.<br /><br />For general information on graduate programs in the US, this book is the clear champion compared with the other available options. Any prospective graduate student that isn't 100 percent sure what program they want to enroll in should own this book.	2004-09-20

There are many rankings which are useful (but inherently subjective when you examine the methodologies) and articles on important considerations like funding, scholarships, admissions, etc.<br /><br />The section with a brief description of the individual schools and programs is the most useful, but also has flaws, most specifically with the survey method used to obtain information. The information is very incomplete and basically only consists of what the admissions department wants the public to know about a given program or school. Schools that did not send the surveys back have essentially no information presented, making them hard to compare to others that did. Many schools didn't answer all questions, so the internal consistency is frequently poor.<br /><br />I think these publications (they are essentially unchanged from year to year) are not intrinsically awful, but the reader needs to take claims of \\"Exclusive Rankings\\", etc. with the grain of salt they deserve. Better yet, just buy a comprehensive book on the subject, of which several are available, probably the best being from Penguin.	2004-09-18

W. Bush administration, and as such had great exposure to the inside workings of government including US relations with the UN. The book is short, easy to read, and generally well documented. It has an extensive \\"notes\\" section with many original sources cited, and photocopies of numerous pertinent UN documents toward the end of the book.<br /><br />The UN has devolved into a sewer of international despotism, and is now nothing more than a third world debating society whose time has long past. Babbin explains the inner workings of the UN from how the UN feels free to assist Saddam Hussein in the totally corrupt \\"oil for food\\" program which netted Saddam (and the UN) billions, to how anti-American moral relativist Kofi Annan devotes his time to propping up third world dictatorships and tyrants. If you ever wanted to know how Libya could replace the US on the UN Human Rights commission, it's in here. If you ever wanted to know how France got a permanent seat on the security council (it was a goodwill gesture), it's in here. If you ever wanted to know how the UN works against the forces of western democracy embodied by the US and the UK, it's in here.<br /><br />The last part of the book exposes the political machinations of \\"Old Europe,\\" by which Babbin largely means France and Germany. Babbin cites the ever astute Mark Twain in a perfectly descriptive quotation on France: \\"France has neither winter nor summer nor morals. Apart from these drawbacks, it is a fine country. France has usually been governed by prostitutes.\\" The more things change, the more they stay the same.<br /><br />There is no questioning what side of the road Jed Babbin is on. I find this to be a cogently presented book that is on the money. With one possible exception, I believe that the one star reviews of this book are by leftists who have not actually read the book. The one that may have read it claims to be a UN insider, but offers no evidence that anything Babbin has said is factually incorrect. The point here is not to dissuade people critical of the book from reviewing it, but rather to point out that, in general, the people who dislike this book have not read the book, and therefore aren't really qualified to judge it. The people who have actually read the book with an open mind seem to find it important and relevant, by and large, I note.<br /><br />I think that Babbin has done the nation and the world a huge favor by writing \\"Inside the Asylum.\\" I recommend that everyone read it before the November elections.ider, but offers no evidence that anything Babbin has said is factually incorrect.

Doganis, an analyst and teacher these days, is able to take all his years in industry (including a stint as CEO of Olympic Airways of Greece) and distill it into a useful text full of real world examples. The third edition is updated to include new developments like Internet ticketing, and was written post-9/11, so that sections dealing with issues such as security are up to date.<br /><br />The book has complete sections on airline, aircraft, and route planning and forecasting, and related subjects such as yield management, marketing, and charter operations. Of particular note is the chapter on pricing policies and fare structures; it is clear that Doganis completely understands the significance of the low cost carriers and the future of yields throughout the different regions of the world.<br /><br />I always enjoy reading Doganis, and vastly prefer this updated version of \\"Flying Off Course\\" to the pre-9/11 \\"The Airline Business in the 21st Century\\" (although I do recommend that book as well.) This is a great book, and should be read and understood by airline managers everywhere. My only caution is that though it is not the most mathematically exhaustive book on the subject, casual readers may not enjoy the book inasmuch as it is quite weighty and the chapter on forecasting demand is fairly mathematically rigorous.	2004-09-14

There may be other books on the subject, but I can't imagine any other book capturing the bittersweet moments of George Washington's return to Mount Vernon after the Revolution more poignantly than Stanley Weintraub does here. The book begins in November 1783 and details Washington's long trip home, and brilliantly captures the trials of long distance travel, as well as the joys of receiving the outpourings of gratitude from his countrymen as he passed through towns and villages.<br /><br />The book gives great insight into the character of Washington and his amazing leadership qualities. I think any reader will better appreciate the suffering and personal sacrifice of this original American patriot after reading this book. The book details the drama of the signing of the final peace treaty with England (assisted by Benjamin Franklin in France), the withdrawal of English troops from New York (a fascinating and oft overlooked drama in and of itself), and the personal interactions of George Washington and other key leaders necessary to keep the coalition of States together in the fight against the British. Particular detail is reserved for efforts to meet the US Army payroll, which, then as now, had substantial Congressional problems as well as issues relating to unwillingness of some States to be taxed.<br /><br />The most interesting facet of the book, though, is the examination of the personal motivations driving Washington. In contrast to most powerful leaders (and Washington at the time was revered enough that he turned down the opportunity to be King of the United States), Washington desired to do his duty, and once having completed his mission by winning the Revolutionary War, to retire from public service. Great detail is spent on the preparations necessary for Washington to resign his commission, and the account of the ceremony and celebrations involved are detailed, scrupulously researched, and thrilling to read.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book. I highly recommend it to anyone, particularly to people who would like to know more about the emotions, motivations, and character of George Washington, the original American patriot.>This is a wonderful book.

The concept is simple: people find things that they were not intended to find, and send it in to Davy, who sorts the wheat from the chaff and comes up with a pithy book of insight on the American psyche. Some of the things that have been found are unreal. I am particularly fond of the love letters and notes left on double parked cars. Others are simply too bizarre to try to contextualize, such as notes reading \\"Warning: The iguana is loose on the porch...\\", and \\"If the ball is too loud take it up when you sleep and put it back down when you get up\\", for instance. But my all time favorites are the lost pet flyers. Now I love animals, and I think it is a real tragedy when someone loses a pet, but these flyers made me laugh so hard I almost fell off my chair (you really need to see them for the full effect): \\"Loss Cat: Speckles, Does not call when come, Dirty, Not tag, Reward needs medicines. Foam. Call Ward.\\"  Best of all is \\"Lost Cobra Color: brown, black, yellow, red (on teeth), blue (color of tongue) Snake has been known to bite off heads. Snake is not house trained. Answers to \\"Psycho\\". Length: 7' Weight: 45 lbs Warning, snake is deadly. Will bite if provoked. Psycho has a strong scottish accent.\\" As hard as I try, I could never make up something that funny.<br /><br />Some of the things are genuinely touching, and some are quite old. A few are from outside the US, but largely this is a peek into the collective subconscious of America. This book is a national treasure.	2004-09-14

I have been using their 2004 \\"Why Paint Cats\\" calendar this year, and it never ceases to make me laugh. These pictures (and stories to match) are marvels of humorous wizardry. Each month features a different feline (my favorites for 2005 are January and December) which has ostensibly been painted for greater artistic merit. Of course this is all a big joke, which I feel I must point out, inasmuch as inevitably some people are convinced that the cats are being horribly mistreated. Not so; the effects are done in a computer. In fact, authors Burton Silver and Heather Busch are active in promoting animal rights.<br /><br />For whimsical feline portraits that will never fail to make you laugh at their over-the-top flamboyance, I recommend this calendar highly.	2004-09-14

This book was originally published in early 2001, and by virtue of predating the terrorist attacks of 9/11 some of the information presented here is a bit outdated. Of course nobody could have accurately predicted the effects of the 9/11 attacks, but there are several other inaccurate predictions in the book as well, most especially the forward looking prediction of fuel prices. There are also several simply incorrect statements presented as fact here. For instance on page 132, Doganis asserts that the key reason that Southwest Airlines is so successful is due to its \\"low cost, non-union labor.\\" Actually Southwest has some of the highest paid workers in the industry (they are, however, more productive, on average, than those at legacy airlines) and virtually all groups at Southwest are unionized. What is true is that many other low cost carriers do in fact have poorly compensated non-union workers. He also (page 133) alleges that Southwest has three Flight Attendants on a 737-300, whereas most airlines use either five or six. I know of no airline that routinely staffs a 737-300 with that many Flight Attendants (the airplane doesn't even have than many Flight Attendant jumpseats), certainly not in the US.<br /><br />Doganis comes out in favor of cabotage and total deregulation of the worldwide industry, which US carriers view as predatory inasmuch as the US domestic market is still the single largest aviation market in the world. The problem with his view is that the US government has for several decades now depended on CRAF (Civil Reserve Air Fleet) aircraft for the majority of its airlift in wartime as a budget cutting measure. By using CRAF for airlift, the USAF needs vastly fewer transport aircraft, saving the government billions of dollars annually. The issue to recognize (which Doganis doesn't even touch on) is that if major airlines come under foreign control, those CRAF aircraft can't be counted on to support the US military. Imagine if French interests controlled one or more major airlines during the latest Iraqi campaign. This is obviously a thorny area that can't be simplistically reduced to the level of analysis that Doganis has reduced it to.<br /><br />Doganis has both good and bad moments in this book. In Chapter Five, his obvious pro-management bent (he is a former CEO of Olympic Airways of Greece) blames virtually all monetary problems on the cost of labor while sometimes discounting bad managerial decisions, although to his credit, in other parts of the book he does discuss the pitfalls of bad management. The book is illustrated with many charts, some of which are quite good, but many of which are irrelevant at best and confusing at worst. The section on e-commerce predates the development of Orbitz and is generally out of date, although many of his predictions have thus far been proven correct. In the plus column, he writes brilliantly on the effects of seat commoditization, and (page 174) brilliantly unmasks the whole Priceline.com issue for what it really is.<br /><br />This book is a weighty and ponderous read, but I do recommend it to airline and management professionals, particularly those with background in the economics of commercial aviation. This book has its faults, but reading it is still time very well spent.ign control, those CRAF aircraft can't be counted on to support the US military.

Not only does it contain extremely detailed road depictions, but also has useful distance information, a table of restricted motorway junctions, a geographical relief map, and depictions of numerous points of interest. I was interested in a detailed map of the Snowdonia region, and in particular for coverage of Portmeirion, Porthmadog, Llanfihangel-y-Traethau, Penrhyndeudraeth, and Ffridd Uchaf. All this and more was well detailed, making for easy route planning. I heartily recommend this map for anyone contemplating a trip to Wales, particularly Northern Wales.	2004-09-10

Not only is the photography colorful and breathtaking, but the narrative and information presented is relevant, topical, and well detailed. I particularly appreciate the fact that less commercial areas are presented well, and with more care than many other guides. The book contains a variety of useful features, from details of interesting spots, to climate, cultural, travel, and lodging information useful to any traveler. I particularly appreciated the coverage of the beautiful and often overlooked Snowdonia region.<br /><br />There are other guidebooks available with somewhat more detailed lodging information, and I would likely buy them as well, but for planning a trip to Wales, this book provides an excellent overview, and facilitates decision making in part by the abundance of color photographs of genuinely captivating subjects. Maps are not particularly detailed, but are carefully scaled and positioned for ease of use.<br /><br />For planning a trip to Wales, this book is virtually indispensable.	2004-09-10

Without getting too deep into the technical details of nuclear systems or chemistry (other than a basic explanation of the general theory of plant operation and a bit of detail about the faulty PORV design), Rees analyzes TMI from a human factors and safety systems vantage point, and subsequently details the improvements made to the US nuclear power industry since the accident.<br /><br />Rees especially details the workings of the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO), a non-governmental industry group which oversees safety more diligently than even the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in a system that Rees dubs \\"communitarian regulation.\\" He details industry problems such as \\"nonconservative decision making\\" and provides useful analogies to other industries. The case of Consolidated Edison (p. 154) is of particular interest for those people interested in studying corporate safety systems and programs.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in nuclear power, and particularly to professionals and students with an interest in industrial safety, regardless of their specific field. This book has applications in every industry, and will improve the understanding of human factors and industrial safety for any interested reader.	2004-09-09

It is essentially a photographic history of the early manned space program through Apollo 13. It contains a brief (two pages or so) historical abstract of Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo and loads of black and white photos. Most of these photos have been seen before, but there are a few that were new to me. There are a few pages of color as well, and a useful glossary and index. Possibly the most useful feature of the book are the brief astronaut biographies in the back of the book, which include even the later scientist-astronauts who flew on Skylab (and of course Jack Schmitt, who flew on Apollo 17.)<br /><br />This is a great books for introducing kids to the early space program (probably junior high school and older) and has some valuable photographs. Don't expect much serious historical writing here, though; it is mainly a picture book.	2004-08-28

I had an interesting perspective of Seuss from a young age, though. My father, an English Professor, was writing his Doctoral dissertation on \\"Transformational Grammar in the Works of Dr. Seuss\\". In this treatise (which involved a good bit of math, it turns out: my Dad's undergraduate education was in Metallurgical Engineering) my Dad approached Seuss from a very adult point of view. Even after growing up, I would continue to marvel at the seeming simplicity of the Seuss tales, while grasping the incredible complexity underlying them all. Needless to say, my late father deserves credit for initially exploring these facets with me.<br /><br />With that background, I had been looking forward to a compendium of the Seuss \\"adult\\" art. This is it, and it is glorious. These pieces are at once similar stylistically to his animation for kids (although I really do believe that kids of all ages love Seuss), but on the other hand are much earthier and adult. To my delight many of these pieces feature cats, but some of the cats are decidedly not friendly, witness, for instance \\"Cat from the Wrong Side of the Tracks\\" (1964). I am particularly fond of his more avant-garde paintings like \\"Impractical Marshmallow-Toasting Device\\", a piece that I would not have been able to identify as a Geisel if not for the telltale handwritten inscription.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Dr. Seuss is for adults as well as children (I also recommend checking out his World War Two political cartoons), and I am delighted to finally have this book (with introduction by the wonderful and whimsical Maurice Sendak) available to see what Ted Geisel did in his spare time. I recommend this book highly.	2004-08-12

The strength of this book is in its comprehensiveness. It lists so many programs that it can be a chore to wade through them all. Fortunately they are indexed in the main text alphabetically, but are cross-referenced in the back by state and program subject.<br /><br />This book would be a hands-down five star slam dunk if it were more up to date. I realize that colleges change their programs all the time, but to me that strongly argues for less time between editions. This was last published in 2002, and much has happened since then especially where Internet learning is concerned. Despite this weakness, it is still at least as current as its competitors, and is vastly more useful and comprehensive. Another small issue that occurs occasionally are short entries like \\"See school website\\" or \\"Contact school\\" in response to required data fields. I gather from reading this that the entries here were exclusively based on the information schools sent back to the editors on a standard survey. It would have been nice if the researchers had actually called the schools and asked for the information to complete these data fields. It would have been more time consuming to write (enormously so, in fact), but the finished product would have been unbeatable.<br /><br />In the end, this is my favorite guide to distance learning available, and despite its weaknesses, I still recommend it to anyone considering a distance learning option at any educational level.	2004-08-12

This book is small, but don't be fooled: it is a true emotional roller coaster that gets to the essence of the human-animal emotional bond better than any other book I have read.<br /><br />Phillip Schreibman was grieving over the loss of both of his parents after long, tortuous illnesses. He had found himself inconsolable and depressed. Much to his surprise the one who finally led him out of his depression was a tiny little orphaned kitten he took in and named Alice. Over her lifetime she managed to teach him important lessons he had never understood before, and ultimately even prepared him for her own passing. There is no question that there is great sadness in this book, but it is ultimately uplifting, as the lessons Phillip learned from \\"Cat School\\", as he called it, let him regain a firm foothold on his own life.<br /><br />This book was particularly touching to me as it paralleled an encounter with a kitten, \\"Ghost Blimp\\" (a.k.a. \\"Gloovis\\") who I took in when she was a tiny ball of fur, and who graced my life for seven years, like Alice. Although those seven years were far too short, in that time her presence helped me recover from the loss of my father. My point here in telling you this is that the lessons Schreibman learns from Alice are universally applicable to other lives as well. I believe that whatever animal you choose to keep company with has lessons to teach you.<br /><br />My only critique of the book would be a disagreement with a couple of the specific conclusions that Schreibman draws about \\"Creation\\" versus \\"Culture.\\" Having said that, it is his book, and the conclusions he draws are important for him to tell. Everyone would have slightly different conclusions after going through events like those relayed here, but that does not diminish the power of this little book.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who is grieving for any reason, particularly after the loss of a loved one, and also to any animal lover. Thank you Phillip, and thank you, Alice, even more for this beautiful book.<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who is grieving for any reason, particularly after the loss of a loved one, and also to any animal lover.

This book is a clever parody of three silly genres all at once: Japanese monster movies, the Manga craze, and professional wrestling. Largely I think it works well as a satirical piece of humor and social commentary, but mostly it is just good old fashioned fun.<br /><br /> The basic premise is that the evil Dr. Cube has created giant monsters that fight each other in the &quot;Kaiju Big Battel&quot; arena for entertainment of the masses. There are good and evil Kaiju, and some rogues that can change allegiances at the drop of a hat. The monsters here are not your typical Japanese Godzilla copycats, but rather creative originals such as Call-Me-Kevin (my personal favorite), the ridiculous looking Sky Deviler, and the heroic tuber, Silver Potato.<br /><br /> The book is broken down into a biography section, a section of famous Kaiju bouts, and assorted other features such as &quot;How Sky Deviler's Digestive System Works&quot; and &quot;Silver Potato's Holiday Miracle&quot;. There is even a color spread that has very amusing faux-Japanese translations like: &quot;Who is the sphincter mouth of depth-perception irrelevant monster? Sky Deviler most high ugliness the dive bomb swoop. Special appetite skill combine with brain lentil size create the deadliest!&quot;<br /><br /> I found the book quite entertaining and diverting. I particularly love old Japanese monster movies, and seeing this pay homage to them while concurrently mocking Manga and wrestling made this book totally worthwhile for me.	2004-08-07

A Candid Guide to the Profession	Books	5	70	72	N	Y	Pragmatic, Useful, And Well Written	In this book Roger Lewis outlines the most important considerations in pursuing a career as an architect. I have always loved architecture, and have read extensively on the subject at the level of an interested amateur. When I was preparing for college in the 1980s, I wanted to pursue a five year professional architecture degree, but was dissuaded when I received a full scholarship in biology. That was an unfortunate decision in the long run, although I have been doing well professionally until recently, when my career field went into steep decline. I never forgot my interest in the subject, and while considering a mid-career occupation change, I have carefully considered returning to school and attempting to be admitted to a 3-4 year M.Arch. program.<br /><br />I am very glad that I read this book (and several others) prior to embarking on a career in architecture. The book is very honest about the rigors of school and the relative lack of money to be obtained in the field, unless you are uncharacteristically brilliant in design (and in selling your services). People like Michael Graves are definitely the exception to the rule. I appreciated Lewis' candor, and honestly the book has made me reappraise my desire to pursue this particular career transition. He repeatedly emphasizes that you should become an architect because of a love of architecture. I also have to be practical in considering that between three or four very expensive years of school and at least three years as an underpaid intern, it is at least seven years to becoming a licensed architect for me, and at this stage of my career that is difficult. Not impossible, but very difficult.<br /><br />I have not decided what professional avenues to pursue yet, but I will always appreciate the practical nature of this book in educating me about an architectural career. This is the most important book a prospective architect can read prior to committing to the arduous path leading to licensure.	2004-08-01

Well Documented	I am always amazed at the number of reviewers who slam books they have clearly not read: if they had actually read this book they would presumably be able to make a comment about something contained within the book, which not one of the one star reviewers seems able to do; instead they rely on spewing their version of the evil of the authors, conservatives, Republicans, or especially President Bush.<br /><br /> I actually have read this book, and found it entertaining, well documented, and factual. Moore has so long disgorged his narcissistic self-important conspiracy theories on America under the guise of documentaries, but in reality he is nothing more than a very creative propagandist featuring footage taken out of context and careful edits. (For a particularly offensive example please refer to the Charlton Heston footage in &quot;Bowling For Columbine&quot; which was extensively edited to the point that the entire meaning of statements in both his interview and speeches were totally distorted.)<br /><br /> This book takes the much needed first step of identifying factual &quot;errors&quot; and extensive fabrication and inconsistencies in statements made by Moore over the years. Most importantly, it is not a slipshod piece of yellow journalism; rather it is excruciatingly well sourced and documented. I particularly appreciated the 33 page bibliography at the conclusion of the book. It would certainly seem that Hardy and Clarke did a lot of hard work researching the career of this pompous windbag. Another feature I appreciated was on Moore's narcissistic personality disorder. I am particularly amused by this observation, taken from the &quot;Notes and Sources&quot; section (p. 232): &quot;The authors would note an ironic feature of this chapter, in that we are responding to a suspected narcissist by...devoting an entire book to him.&quot;<br /><br /> There is important truth revealed here: propaganda has been used throughout the years, Moore is just the latest, most clever, most creative, and fundamentally most deceptive of the propagandists. The world owes David Hardy and Jason Clarke a debt of gratitude for exposing Michael Moore for what he is: a self-purported documentarian creating nothing less than anti-US propaganda.<br /><br /> I also look forward to seeing the movie by Michael Wilson called &quot;Michael Moore Hates America&quot; when it is released. This film is covered in some detail in the book, and essentially is someone turning Moore's own tricks on him, much to his fury. Wilson has worked very hard on this piece and it brings Moore full circle to &quot;Roger And Me&quot; except this time a different young filmmaker is pursuing a different genuinely dishonest, bloated fat cat.<br /><br /> I recommend reading this book after you have actually read Moore's books, and then compare the two for sourcing, accuracy, and honesty. All I ask is that you actually read the books before you review them; otherwise you are as fundamentally phony as Michael Moore himself.latest, most clever, most creative, and fundamentally most deceptive of the propagandists.

The book is very short (128 pages) and can be read in a couple of hours, nonetheless it describes combat operations in the F-105 from a personal viewpoint that will captivate most readers, particularly those familiar with the Thud or the air war in Southeast Asia.<br /><br /> The book gives background about the author and USAF fighter pilots in general, and moves on to his tour of duty in Vietnam and the struggle to complete his 100 missions North and all the triumphs, tragedies, terror, and turmoil involved in attaining that lofty goal.<br /><br /> The reason that I deducted one star from my rating is that despite the interesting and captivating prose in this book, it is horrendously scarred with typographical errors, bad grammar, and questionable punctuation. The problem is so pronounced that in some cases the errors seemingly change the intent of the author. This book could have seriously used a proofreader or at least a trip through spell check.<br /><br /> Although there are other books on the F-105 in Vietnam that I would recommend before reading this one (in particular &quot;Thud Ridge&quot; and &quot;Going Downtown&quot; by Jack Broughton, &quot;When Thunder Rolled&quot; by Ed Rasimus, and &quot;100 Missions North&quot; by Ken Bell) this is a good book for F-105 enthusiasts, and is an interesting, if grammatically-challenged, personal account of the air war in Vietnam.	2004-08-01

Of course now there are several &quot;Get Fuzzy&quot; books, calendars, posters, etc., available for purchase, and they are worth the money to devoted fans of the strip. I am especially partial to the books but now for the second year I have bought the day-to-day calendar to provide a bright spot in any day, no matter how otherwise dull.<br /><br /> Everyone needs a calendar, so if you love animals, and particularly if you have personality intensive pets, you will love this calendar. I ordered mine early and already peeked at the strips for the year ahead, and they are funnier than ever. Buy this calendar if you want a dose of animal related fun every day for 2005.

By and large it takes a dictionary form and defines words as they are commonly meant to be understood by liberals. The definitions are generally very witty and right on the mark. I opened at random for an example and came up with page 104. The first entry on the page is an excellent example of what to expect: &quot;Obscene: Liberal pejorative applied to 'outrageous' corporate profits; not, however, applicable to pornographic magazines or motion pictures.&quot; That isn't my favorite from the many entries, but it is a random example of what you can expect here. Of course, there are entries for things like &quot;hate-crime&quot;, &quot;extremists&quot; (which never applies to the left, of course), &quot;multicultural&quot;, &quot;chilling effect&quot;, and my favorite, &quot;meaningful dialogue&quot;.<br /><br /> I was thinking of a four star rating for the book as funny as it is, largely because I like to reserve five star awards for truly exceptional books. I ended up with five stars, though, after I read the appendices, which are all written in good humor and are all actually quite informative and well done. I especially want to single out Appendix 4 &quot;Six Liberal Myths&quot; as important reading. These are all things that everyone should know, but many don?t.<br /><br /> This book is great for exposing the hypocrisy of liberal-speak. So the next time you hear talk of &quot;ethnocentrism,&quot; &quot;fascism,&quot; &quot;ethnic pride&quot; (all of which are incredibly overused today), or any of the other scores of catchphrases so popular on the left, know exactly what to say to expose what is being said for what is meant. This is a great, funny, and desperately needed book. My hat is off to Victor Gold, I just wish that I had thought of it first!	2004-07-22

This report summarizes the actual factual findings, and has a complete analysis of the accident; spreading blame in the &quot;Causes&quot; section, in what I believe is a very fair manner.<br />This is a relatively unknown incident inasmuch as no aircraft damage or injuries occurred, but the potential of a serious ground collision existed, but was fortunately avoided. The aircraft was bound from Malta to London, where eventually it was cleared for an unusual approach to Runway 26R, which neither pilot had ever landed on at night. Runway 26R is in a complex of peculiar and difficult to understand lights, and the adjacent Taxiway 2 is easily mistaken for the runway. In fact there was an earlier runway incursion on Taxiway 2 in 1988 involving a BAC-111 attempting to land on Runway 8L.<br />The runway lighting at Gatwick is only one of the threats that pilots deal with on a daily basis. This report sheds copious amounts of light on some of the critical sources of runway incursions: poor airport design, lighting, and markings. Unfortunately, these problems are far from isolated, and although many problem areas are well documented (Cleveland, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Chicago-O'Hare are especially notorious in the US) barring an accident relatively little is done about these structural problems seemingly due largely to monetary and political considerations.<br />For any researcher of runway incursion accidents, this report is of great value. I highly recommend it to air safety personnel everywhere.	2004-07-18

He is one of the more perceptive interviewers out there, and even when I disagree with him, I am always interested in what he has to say, and what the diverse group of panelists he has on says as well.<br />This book, which was written before Dennis had his political awakening on September 11, 2001, is more center-left politically than he currently is. I think Miller has matured and become a realist since 9/11, and find it interesting comparing some of his rants in this book to his more highly evolved positions today.<br />The best rants in this book, though, are the apolitical rants, my favorite of which is titled &quot;Fear of Flying.&quot; Dennis Miller hates flying, and his insights are extremely entertaining to me, a professional airline pilot. What is interesting here is that except for the actual fear of being airborne, I totally agree with him on the subject of modern airline travel. My favorite line from this particular rant sums up his position perfectly: &quot;Once you've nestled into your seat, which was last cleaned by the Earth-bound third Wright Brother, Noodles, and you've arranged your miniscule stinky synthetic car wash shammy [sic] of a blanket and your Stay Free pillow pad that's the size and softness of a geltab multivitamin, and adjusted to the jet cold, tuberculosis-microbe-laden recirculated air that's blowing right down your spine, you've now achieved the comfort level of a North Korean POW with an ingrown toenail and no premium cable.&quot; What can I say? He's right. This is why on my days off you will see me as far away from the airport as is humanly possible.<br />I would give the book five stars, except the frequently needless adult language really restricts the audience of people with whom I can share this brilliant work. Dennis thanks for setting the world straight.	2004-07-17

It isn't actually bad; it just isn't up to the standard of critical architectural writing now commonly available. The book is a large format coffee table book, with a very inviting cover. Inside you will largely find many color pictures of several buildings the authors consider significant, although I frequently disagree with their appraisals of individual projects. There are some truly breathtaking projects illustrated, my favorite of which is the Ackerberg House in Malibu, California, though there are several other worthy projects depicted such as the Stockholm University Library and some of Itsuko Hasegawa's greatest Japanese homes in Tokyo and Shizuoka, Japan.<br />Unfortunately, the book does not pick uniformly excellent or even representative works to showcase. Some of the most garish and hideous examples of contemporary architecture imaginable are illustrated in this book, such as the grotesque Lloyds Building (London), which appears to have taken its form from that of a refinery, the mind-bogglingly ugly INIST Documentation Centre (Nancy, France), which appears to be the work of nomadic architects trying to redefine a tent as high art, and the most ungainly building of all, the Renault Distribution Centre in Swindon, England, which looks like a giant anthropomorphic caterpillar walking across otherwise beautiful English countryside.<br />Taken in combination with the text, which is Spartan and not particularly enlightening, I think that this book had great potential, but withered on the vine. Some of the book is great, but the bulk is merely bland, and some is downright awful.<br />Although there are some good features in the book, overall it only deserves two stars in my estimation: there are just too many other truly excellent books on modern architecture available to bother with this.	2004-07-13

It is very detailed and has separate chapters for important topics such as structure, climate services, lighting, acoustics, fire safety, etc. Although the author largely stays away from mathematics, he is always clear and concise in dealing even with complex analytical problems. As an example I would give his excellent treatment of two and three-hinged portals, and the fascinating parallels he draws between the engineering ideal of arches and the different types of portals. He covers all major construction techniques from timber platform frame construction (generally of houses), to more complex forms such as the hyperbolic paraboloid (opposed double curvature), and the esoteric &quot;hyperboloid of revolution&quot;, the opposed double curvature architecture (almost always in concrete) common in power station cooling towers.<br />His writing on accessory systems such as heating, air conditioning, ventilation, and fire detection and prevention are both introductory and comprehensive. In all areas from structure to systems he is careful to explain real-world rationale in an approachable format that is both thorough and easy to understand.<br />This book is wonderful. It should be read by every student in engineering or architecture school (the section in chapter one on stresses is of enormous value to technical students), and I would further recommend it to practicing professionals as an excellent conceptual 'refresher course' of real world building systems wisdom. This is an excellent book.	2004-07-11

The Lockheed beauty was the most graceful, yet agile plane I ever flew, and I miss her every time I take to the sky.  In this book, Philip Birtles does the L-1011 justice with an in-depth look at the history of the program, operators, technical specifications, a production list, and a concise accident summary.<br />In general, the &quot;Airliner Color History&quot; series is quite good, but this volume on the L-1011 sets the bar. This is the gold standard of TriStar books. Anyone from an aerospace historian to a pilot, to an L-1011 devotee will love this book. It features very accurate and fairly detailed information (although not to the level of a Pilot Operations Manual, of course), and superb photography, mostly in color.<br />To me the L-1011 will always be the Queen of the Sky. The TriStar was the best designed, safest, best flying plane ever built, and many of the systems (like the DLC and Autoland) are still unrivalled for technical excellence. Whether you are an old TriStar fan, or you just want to learn about Lockheed's greatest marvel, this is a great addition to your library!	2004-07-08

This volume deals with the development of the A-300, and traces the evolution of Airbus as an organization in the early years. I have no personal knowledge of the A-300, although I am very favorably disposed to the later Airbus products (particularly from my experiences flying the A-320). This book is a valuable reference for people interested in the pioneering Airbus, the A-300 (which is still being built today, albeit as the A-300-600).<br />The book includes a well written section on systems, contains an operators list, production list, and accident list, and assorted other information (technical advances, Zero-G simulator, Beluga, etc.) While I don't think this is the best of the series (the Birtles L-1011 book is easily the best in the &quot;Airliner Color History&quot; series), I still think it is very well done, and although I can't personally vouch for the technical accuracy in this volume, Gunter Endres writes in an authoritarian and informative manner, and seems eminently credible. I recommend it to anyone interested in early Airbus history or the A-300 specifically.	2004-07-08

OK, I admit it, my VERY favorite is the L-1011, but unfortunately the old girl has largely been put out to pasture now. But after the TriStar, there is no question that the A-320 is the one I would rather spend my time in, hands down, bar none. It is a pilot friendly machine, and the only people I know that badmouth it are the people who haven't ever flown it. It is an honest, forgiving, and easy plane to fly, and is smart enough to do the things you want it to do for you (like shutting down the air conditioning packs prior to engine start, and turning them back on when the engine is stabilized on speed), but is still a joy to hand fly. This is one airplane that has the competition beat, hands down. (I can say that since I have flown the 737, too.)<br />Now that you know how I feel about the airplane, let me tell how I feel about the book: it is a great introduction to the Airbus A-320 series. It has scads of beautifully shot color photos, useful production and operator lists, and an excellent general history of Airbus and the A-320 family specifically. There is a nice section on technical specifications for the series, and although it doesn't get into pilot level systems descriptions, what the book does say is pretty much on the money, and easy to understand. They even have a nice diagram of PFD/ND/ECAM data and symbology found on the six CRTs. There is a very general discussion on the benefits of Fly-By-Wire (FBW), but I suspect most readers would have liked a bit more on this remarkable technology. (Yes, I prefer the side stick to the yoke...)<br />This book is great for pilots, enthusiasts, or for that matter, aerospace historians. My only (tiny) nitpicks were a couple of explanations that are less than completely correct in the accident section, particularly in the Lufthansa Warsaw accident. The errors mostly concern omitting a few crucial details, and unless you are an A-320 pilot or an accident investigator you won't really care anyway. I realize that being concise is something the editors require, but sometimes another line or two can really clarify matters.<br />All told this is another in the excellent &quot;Airliner Color History&quot; series, which are generally great. For someone who wants an introduction to the greatest airliner family in the world (and here I include all the FBW Airbus family members from the A-318 to the A-380) with lots of outstanding photographs and excellent background text, this book can't be beat.ansa Warsaw accident.

This book is a photo book of DC-9s of many different operators. The subtitle of the book is &quot;Airline Markings, Vol. 9&quot;, and that is pretty much what you get. This is a worthwhile series if you have particular interest in the markings on a specific airliner type. The book is scant on narrative, dwelling almost exclusively on color photographs of DC-9s in action. I recommend this book to DC-9 fans with the understanding that it really doesn't cover much information textually, but does have loads of great pictures of the classic Douglas twinjet.	2004-07-06

This is a small book devoted to the A-320, and it is mainly a book of photographs. The illustrations are generally excellent, but the book is very short, and the text is very general.<br />Honestly, I was torn between three and four stars here, but went with four due to the quality of the photographs. It isn't that this is a bad book; it is just very brief, and fairly insubstantial in terms of text, although in fairness it is from the &quot;Airline Markings&quot; series, and it does cover that aspect of the A-320 well.<br />The A-320 is a dream to fly, and if you want a great little book chock full of photos of A-320s, this is a good one.	2004-07-06

I love it and couldn't wait to buy this book. Largely, I was very pleased with the book. I particularly like the way the book is broken down into major subjects like \\"Condensed Art History\\" and \\"Condensed Physics\\". I especially enjoyed the science sections and the \\"Condensed Pop Culture\\" chapter. I was particularly impressed with the analysis of the confusing lyrics in Steve Miller's \\"The Joker\\" (yes the line actually IS \\"Some people call me Maurice, 'cuz I speak of the pompatus of love.\\") The solving of this mystery alone is worth the price of the book.<br />I really sat on the fence on whether to give the book four or five stars. I would give it 4 1/2 if that were an option, but there were a few little thing about the book that bugged me enough to prevent a five star review (although I do give the magazine five stars.) The first (minor) error I noticed is in the chapter \\"Condensed General Science\\" under \\"Sexy Animal Facts\\", where the author states that \\"A goldfish has a memory span of only three seconds\\". I hold a degree in Biology, and can categorically say that is untrue. This is an urban legend and supposition, which has been disproved in several studies in animal behavior in which goldfish were taught to swim in elaborate mazes over the span of several days. If they only had a three second memory, they would be unable to complete the maze correctly with ever improving times day after day (which shows that learning occurs.) The television show 'Mythbusters' did a primitive version of one of these studies on one show, by the way. This isn't a big point, but is worth noting.<br />I object to the politically correct use of the terms of 'BC' and 'BCE' instead of 'BC' and 'AD'. Although the calendars are identical there is no valid reason to dispense with the terminology in place since about 525 AD just to be politically correct. It is annoying, reduces the comprehensibility of the dates in the book and in no way improves the calendar.<br />I find it a bit ironic in the chapter \\"Condensed History\\" that sometimes journalism professor Peter Haugen has a section called \\"Rotten to the Corps: Tyrants with Horrific Rap Sheets\\" in which obvious winners such as Stalin and Hitler make the grade, but so do three 'Pasas' from nineteenth century Turkey, due to forced relocations of peasants during wartime. They may well have been bad guys, but even historians disagree whether or not this was an unfortunate byproduct of war or genocide of a minority group. My point is that there is a lot of ambiguity here, and elevating them to the same plane as Hitler while leaving every single corrupt Middle Eastern despot off the list entirely is patently ridiculous. Bottom line: this list lacks historical objectivity.<br />In \\"Condensed Literature\\" the allegation is made that Chaucer's \\"The Canterbury Tales\\" is still 'fresh and funny' after 600 years. Everybody can have their own opinion, but I have read \\"The Canterbury Tales\\", and can say from personal experience that absolutely nothing could make \\"The Canterbury Tales\\" in any way fresh or funny.<br />Finally, under \\"Condensed Religion\\" there appears a box titled \\"The Problem of Evil\\" which attempts to refute religion as a belief system. The logical assertions are not well constructed, and most any individual dedicated to any monotheistic religion (that I know of, anyway) will have no difficulty recognizing the fallacies in the rather disingenuous arguments presented.<br />Overall, this is a credible, interesting book, though I don't think it is quite up to the quality of \\"Mental Floss\\" magazine. I recommend the book, but, as always, read skeptically, and let the arguments make sense before you change long-held beliefs. Having said that, the book is fun and irreverent.

Having read other books from this series (notably the Birtles L-1011 book, the Endres A-300 book, and the Laming and Hewson A-320 book), I ordered this volume in connection with research I am doing for my Master's thesis. In comparison to those other volumes in the series I found this book lacking in detail and accuracy in some cases. The author apologizes right off the bat for this claiming that due to the number of aircraft built, he was unable to be comprehensive in the book. Though the book allegedly covers the B-737-300-800 series, it really focuses on the 300-500, as the NGs were just starting to come off the line when this book was written. There are very few photos of 600-800 series aircraft, and the ones that are here are in Boeing paint or primer. There is essentially no coverage of the -900 to speak of, other than mention that it exists.<br />If you want to look at color pictures of 737s, this is the book for you. It is really a photo book with a bit of text, rather than an in-depth look at the aircraft. Certainly do not expect any serious discussion of systems here. There is a lot of redundancy between the sections of the book as well: prepare to be told the same information repeatedly, rather than have new information revealed as you progress through the book. There are also several inaccuracies in the book.<br />I have flown several models of the 737, and my estimation of the book is that it's OK for easy to look up facts, such as launch dates, first flights, etc., but do not rely on this book for technical information. There are even parts of the book where the author is unsure of his material and just leaves the doubt and indecision in the book instead of actually finding out the correct information. For example, in a discussion of painting the aircraft he reveals that the 737s are covered in primer at Renton then flown to Boeing Field for painting, except for the rudder which is painted prior to flight. He explains that the rudder &quot;is finished in customer livery prior to being fitted to the aircraft. This has something to do with the weighing of the aircraft which affects the trim&quot; (p. 16). Two points here: his understanding is close, but no cigar; and second, if you are writing a book that technical people are going to read, call Boeing and ask them why the rudder is painted first. This is not the only gaffe of this sort, but it illustrates the problem.<br />The coverage of the accidents is spartan, and also contains errors. The book predates the ruling on the UA 585 and US 427 accidents. He does mention that the rudder is suspect (to his credit), but beware that the book contains no real authoritative information on the rudder or those accidents.<br />Anyone who knows me well knows that of all the airliners I have flown (A-320, DC-9, MD-80, B-727, B-737, B-747-400, B-757, B-767, and L-1011) that the B-737 is hands down my least favorite for many, many reasons. Having said that, I gave this book a fair shake, but it simply came up short. The book largely reads like Boeing corporate propaganda: it seems much more biased than the other books in the series which I have read. It is also the book with the least amount of concrete information on the subject aircraft, and contains more inaccuracies and tenuous information than the others do.<br />Like I said before, if you for some reason would want to look at color photos of 737s, buy this book; if you are looking for technical information, look elsewhere.painted prior to flight.

I was tremendously disappointed in the book in general. While there are worthwhile observations from many notable architects (and students), the book devolves into a self-congratulatory, politically correct collection of &quot;insights&quot; in language so obfuscating that the gist of the statement is normally impossible to determine.<br />The book takes it as a guiding principle that Occam's Razor (which requires the simplest of equal competing alternatives be selected as best) is never to be regarded, and that when one small word will suffice, ten large words will instead be used. Is it so hard for these obviously very bright people to speak English? Here is a prime example from page 10, which I obtained by opening the book at random: &quot;In blob modeling, objects are defined by monad-like primitives with internal forces of attraction and mass. Unlike a conventional geometric primitive such as a sphere, which has its own autonomous organization, a meta-ball is defined in relation to other objects. Its center, surface area, mass and organization are determined by other fields of influence. The surfaces are surrounded by two halos of relational influence, one defining a zone of fusion, the other defining a zone of inflection.&quot; I will spare you the rest, but suffice it to say that that paragraph drones on and on, and gets even more ridiculous before it is concluded.<br />The organization of the book is so confusing that there is actually a key to decoding the format at the beginning. The format is extremely unpleasant. Avant-garde? Yes! Readable? No! Largely the book is an index (hence the title) taken alphabetically, but there is an abundance of information in tiny font adjacent to the text in the gutters, which are, inexplicably, the hideous color of green found in the interior of a school bus.<br />Among the horrid design of the pages and the tiny graphics that rarely are directly associated with anything else on the page or under discussion, there is some genuinely brilliant commentary on contemporary architecture, which is, after all, why someone would buy this book. Due to these occasional pithy insights, combined with a few brilliant illustrations, I give the book two stars.<br />I would not recommend this book to many people, probably only practicing architects, and only with the strong caveat that it is very unpleasant and annoying reading trying to sort the wheat from the chaff, hidden as the wheat is among the pomposity and pretentiousness of the text.

The photography and commentary are both first rate, mimicking and mocking the pretentiousness of the contemporary art scene without losing the sense of whimsy that has been the hallmark of the series since the book of the same title was first published.<br />Some people seem aghast that people actually paint cats. Well don't. This is a joke. The visual effects are done courtesy of Photoshop long after the photos have been taken. The creators, Burton Silver and Heather Busch, are quite devoted bona fide animal lovers, and although I am sure they would be flattered that some people thought the effects are real, would never allow harm to come to these beautiful animals.<br />This is a beautifully done calendar, and is perfect for the art lover in your life. I look forward to the 2005 &quot;Why Paint Cats&quot; calendar. I have no doubt it will be as spectacular as this!	2004-06-29

The book is extremely difficult, no, impossible, to categorize. It is essentially a photographic primer on the stark, almost anarchist, ultra-modern architectural works of Kalkin. I am a great fan of contemporary and industrial architecture, but I have never seen it taken to this level before.<br />Interspersed with the architectural forays are hand drawn, child-like sketches of concepts that are far beyond the boundaries of normal architecture books. In particular, the &quot;Sphincter of Loneliness&quot; on p. 94 caught my attention, as did the test on p. 59, which features such questions as these:<br />Diaper is to Sari as:<br />a) urbanism is to classicism<br />b) rain is to fog<br />c) fez is to spanking<br />Who was the least well known:<br />a) Plotinus<br />b) Elvis<br />c) The Nancy Drew Series<br />Essay: Write twenty words or less on the following topic<br />Clinton: Sage or Bedwetter?<br />Clearly this is no ordinary architect. While some of his works are a bit too industrial even for my tastes, you will be hard pressed to find a more unusual, stimulating, weird, or fun book on contemporary architecture.<br />It is simply mind boggling.	2004-06-26

Books	4	5	5	N	Y	An Experience So Vacuous, It's Almost Frightening...	&quot;An experience so vacuous, it's almost frightening...&quot; is from a review of 'Xanadu' by Ian Birch, and sums up much of the commentary in this amusing little book. The book is a collection of reviews covering several centuries, and featuring many notables (and others you have never heard of) such as George Bernard Shaw, Dorothy Parker, and the wonderfully biting Rick Kushman, who makes reading the 'Sacramento Bee' a singular pleasure. The book is presented in sections on theater, movies, literature, etc., and features some delicious examples of literary witticism. I have my favorites and they are far too numerous to mention, but what follows are just a few examples to illustrate my point.<br />&quot;'The Birthday Party' is like a vintage Hitchcock thriller which has been, in the immortal tear-stained words of Orson Wells, 'edited by a cross-eyed studio janitor with a lawn mower.'&quot; -Alan Brien<br />&quot;This is M. Ionesco's first attempt at a social play, and the number of interpretations to which it is susceptible is roughly equal to the number of people in the audience.&quot; - Kenneth Tynan on 'Rhinoceros' by Eugene Ionesco, 1960<br />&quot;They gave us for dinner boiled ant-bear and red monkey; two dishes unknown even at Beauvilliers or Paris.... The monkey was very good indeed, but the ant-bear had been kept beyond its time; it stank as our venison does in England...&quot; -Charles Waterton<br />&quot;What can I do with it? It's like a lot of yaks jumping about.&quot;<br />-Sir Thomas Beecham on the third movement of Beethoven's 'Seventh Symphony'<br />&quot;The music of Wagner imposes mental tortures that only algebra has the right to inflict.&quot; -Paul de Saint-Victor on Richard Wagner in 'La Presse'<br />And finally, my all time favorite review in the entire book, and probably of all time:<br />&quot;I love Wagner; but the music I prefer is that of a cat hung up by its tail outside a window and trying to stick to the panes of glass with its claws.&quot; -Charles Baudelaire<br />My only criticism of the book is that its roughly square shape makes holding it a bit of a chore, as it is quite thick, yet dimuitive of height and width. It's good material, just a less than ideal format. If you want a book filled with some of the worlds all time pithiest reviews, this is the book for you.ws.&quot; -Charles Baudelaire<br />My only criticism of the book is that its roughly square shape makes holding it a bit of a chore, as it is quite thick, yet dimuitive of height and width.

I have always been interested in Pearl Harbor and World War Two in the Pacific Theatre, and have read extensively on it (I particularly like the Gordon Prange books, especially &quot;At Dawn We Slept&quot;.) I found the 'Arizona' memorial to be a place of beauty and tranquility, yet amazingly solemn and haunting. After the visit, I decided to learn more about the 'Arizona' herself. This is a great book for a start. It is an interesting amalgam of operational history, information on the attack, including an excellent section debunking myths surrounding the attack, personal recollections, and historical preservation efforts today.<br />The bulk of the book deals with recollections of crewmembers on shipboard life, with emphasis on December 7, 1941, obviously. These recollections form a valuable oral history of the ship, and though there are minor conflicts between the stories on a couple of details, they are heartfelt, well told, captivating, and historically irreplaceable.<br />Equally important is the story of the current preservation efforts of the National Park Service to manage the wreck. In particular, the stories of survivors who elect to rejoin their fallen comrades when they are interred in Turret Four are moving beyond all expectations, and reinforce the significance of the Pearl Harbor attack in their lives.<br />There are some minor errors in the book, many of which are typographical, for instance using &quot;savage&quot; instead of &quot;salvage&quot;. Some of the errors are a bit more careless as in a reference to 'General Yamamoto', when he was, of course, and Admiral, and going back and forth on whether the 'Arizona' was tied up at quay F-7 or F-8 (I believe it was F-8.) These are pretty nit-picky, but need to be mentioned. The book does have a couple of standout features in the five appendices. Appendix A is an excellent, if brief, overview of the key events in the Pacific war, Appendix B is an 'Arizona' casualty list, Appendix C is a list of 'Arizona' survivors, and Appendix E is a list of ship casualties of Japan in World War Two. Appendix E makes a sobering statement, that I have never heard anywhere else and found utterly fascinating: &quot;Of the attacking Japanese fleet that initiated the war against the United States on December 7, 1941, all ships ended up on the bottom of the sea by the war's end except one midget submarine.&quot; As horrible as Pearl Harbor was for the American forces, the whirlwind reaped by Japan, in the end, was no less ferocious.the key events in the Pacific war, Appendix B is an 'Arizona' casualty list, Appendix C is a list of 'Arizona' survivors, and Appendix E is a list of ship casualties of Japan in World War Two.

Largely the brainchild of gifted young architects Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos, the Erasmus Bridge has now totally captivated the cityscape of Rotterdam, and has endeared itself to modern architecture aficionados everywhere. Personally, this is my favorite bridge of the twentieth century.<br />This book is essentially a monograph, lavishly illustrated in color that details conceptualization, design fabrication, and assembly of this modern marvel. Extensive interviews with van Berkel enlighten readers to the inner workings of the process and creative considerations that went into the Erasmus Bridge.<br />The book has many sectional and elevation views and hundreds of illuminating photographs to address details of construction in any level of detail that any reader might wish to see. The most interesting chapter in the book to me was on the design and assembly of the asymmetrical central pylon, although the bascule bridge and lighting chapters are also standouts. In particular, the calculations that went into the folding section of the bascule bridge, which actually leans toward Noordereiland when raised due to the unusual angular construction of the bridge, are stunning achievements in architectural design and engineering.<br />The entire book is framed by the political, economic, and social impacts that the bridge has had on the people of Rotterdam, and the bridge as a stand alone work of art. I plan on a visit to Rotterdam next year to examine the amazing collection of modern architecture to be found there, of which the Erasmus Bridge is the surely crown jewel. Well done Ben van Berkel for building such a magnificent structure, and thank you Todd Gannon for bringing this valuable book to us.	2004-06-17

Gary Gladstone makes a point of photographing a representative person from each town to help capture the mood in that small part of America. The results are some beautiful photos taken in such unusually named towns as Crapo, MD, Yum Yum, TN, and Boogertown, NC.<br />Gladstone is a very gifted photographer, and his narration and description of the places and people he discovered is to be savored. You will laugh with him, and occasionally feel a bit of pathos, too. This is a truly unique collection of original photographs that most anyone with a sense of humor will enjoy.	2004-06-17
US	52988732	R15UK9FS5L5GJN	0974537616	164161415	A National Party No More: The Conscience of a Conservative Democrat	Books	5	14	24	N	N	Candid and Refreshing	I have liked Zell Miller since I lived in Georgia when he was Governor. Although as a conservative, I generally vote Republican, I was proud to support Governor Miller for his second term (I moved to the state during his first term.) I have no question that Zell is a man of integrity and honesty; I believed it when he was Governor, and I believe it today.<br />In this book Zell delves into several topics, but most notably into the transmogrification of the Democratic Party into the party of far-left special interests. In the first portion of the book he discusses his upbringing, his family and his background. He is a fascinating man, who has truly earned his place in history. With that place, he has learned introspection and humility, and that is the single attribute that differentiates him from the bulk of politicians, and differentiates this book from most political retrospectives. My only serious critique item would be that although all parts of this book are interesting and well written, I think the book could have been perhaps a bit better focused and edited. Some of the transitions between subjects, particularly early in the text, are a little rough.<br />Certainly there are subjects on which I disagree with Miller, for instance the long term wisdom on most of FDRs New Deal programs, and public funding for the National Endowment for the Arts (although I do agree with him on arts education in the schools) to name a couple. The point is that I respect his opinions, and have come up with different informed opinions of my own in several instances. That reflects one of his biggest themes in the book, namely that the current Democratic Party leadership is a solid block of far-left positions, and that deviating from that party line is strictly forbidden. This is especially true of highly emotional issues such as opposition to tax cuts, and the right to have an abortion. Miller eloquently points out that this was not always the case, with no less a Democratic stalwart than John F. Kennedy championing giant tax cuts (which were passed by an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress) at a time when the budget deficit was a vastly larger percentage of GDP than it is now in terms of inflation adjusted dollars. My point isn't to champion tax cuts here (though I happen to agree with them) but to echo the point in the book that it is verboten to even have rational dialogue on the issues in Congress anymore, and particularly within the Democratic party.<br />Miller addresses a plethora of current problems in an always straightforward style. He is particularly eloquent on legacy social programs from the LBJ years, when he states &quot;[These programs] were designed to compensate the victims of poverty rather than to solve the problems that cause it. They gave poor people enough in the way of Medicaid, welfare, food stamps, and housing subsidies to keep and sustain them in their poverty instead of giving them the skills and opportunities they need to break out of their poverty.&quot; I have never seen a more succinct and thoughtful encapsulation of all that was wrong with the 'Great Society' programs. Miller is also one of the most expert Governors and Senators on education, and sponsored Georgia's highly successful HOPE scholarships and pre-kindergarten programs. (Do not confuse the Georgia HOPE scholarship with the abortive program of confusing tax credits introduced by Clinton several years later that just happens to share the name of its successful Georgia progenitor.) Miller talks about the perils of modern education with all the self-important expert educrats emphasizing self-esteem over achievement. It is now so bad that some schools will not designate a Valedictorian for fear that it cause emotional harm to others who weren't selected. Once again, Miller says it best: &quot;Show me a school or a school system that emphasizes how children should learn rather than what they should learn and has 'facilitators' instead of teachers, and I'llshow you a failing system.&quot;<br />For these courageous stands of logic, historical perspective, and common sense in opposition to the Democratic Party monolith, Zell Miller is to be commended. What really made the book complete was the transcript of his Senate speech made the day after 9/11, both a sensitive tribute to American heroes, and a much needed battle cry for protection of America. This one section of the book is worth the purchase price by itself.<br />I would be remiss if I didn't mention the incisive and brilliant chapters on the Carter and Clinton election campaigns from the point of view of an insider, and the valid conclusions that he drew from them (which every politician should study), and perhaps the most valuable day to day advice in the book, a list composed on his seventieth birthday for his four grandchildren, called &quot;Some Lessons Learned By Seventy.&quot; Anyone of any political persuasion should heed well the advice on that list.<br />Though there are topics on which we disagree, there are very few politicians I have admired more than Zell Miller. He is an honest, hard working, self made man, and I salute him for his years of service from his time spent in the USMC through his Governorship and Senate service. The United States is a great nation because of men like Zell Miller. This book is highly recommended for anyone of any political ilk.<br />Thank you, Zell.l show you a failing system.&quot;<br />For these courageous stands of logic, historical perspective, and common sense in opposition to the Democratic Party monolith, Zell Miller is to be commended.

The book is a rather compendious (though oddly shaped) book full of silly things said by people and corporations throughout the ages. Many of these quotes are very funny, for example: &quot;A sad ending, albeit a happy one&quot; (Murray Walker, motorsports commentator); &quot;The policeman isn't there to create disorder, the policeman is there to preserve disorder&quot; (Richard J. Daley, Chicago Mayor); and &quot;We shall never make war except for peace&quot; (William McKinley.) I selected these three quotes by opening to three random pages, and they capture a representative sample of the books contents.<br />While many of these quotes are very entertaining, I actually found the book a bit stilted and at some points repetitive and dull. There are sections (especially among the politicians) with numerous very similar, modestly entertaining quotations that are generally a case of getting tongue-tied on hard to pronounce phrases. We have all done that, and a few of them are entertaining, but there are way too many represented here.<br />Additionally there are a few quotations wrongly included, which are actually brilliant that I just don't think the author understood, such as the Edsgar Dijkstra quip: &quot;The question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can swim.&quot; Here Dijkstra is not asserting that submarines can swim, rather that computers can't think. My point is only that there are a few misunderstood quotations taken out of context that are actually not stupid at all, but may seem to be if you don't understood what is being said in the context in which it is stated.<br />The book is square, and has very small print going nearly to the spine of the book, making it rather difficult to read. On balance, there are some real gems of quotation in here (Watch out for more than a few 'attributed to' quotations, that in some cases seem highly suspect) but all in all there are much better books of this variety available, chief among them being the wonderful &quot;Anguished English&quot; by Richard Lederer and the sublime &quot;Non Campus Mentis&quot; by Anders Henriksson.e (Watch out for more than a few 'attributed to' quotations, that in some cases seem highly suspect) but all in all there are much better books of this variety available, chief among them being the wonderful &quot;Anguished English&quot; by Richard Lederer and the sublime &quot;Non Campus Mentis&quot; by Anders Henriksson.	2004-06-09

I am also a current CFI, although I don't frequently exercise my Instructor privileges in single engine aircraft. Not long ago I was approached to assist in teaching a Private Pilot ground school and to do some tutoring on the side. I accepted more for the challenge than any other reason.<br />The selected text for the course was the &quot;Private Pilot Manual&quot; by Jeppesen Sanderson, and I must say that I was very impressed with the book. It is very complete and provides easy to comprehend explanations (normally with useful diagrams, charts, or photographs) that make learning relatively painless. It was an excellent refresher for me as well, as single engine VFR flying is not what I do on a daily basis anymore. I highly recommend this book to CFI's for their students, to any Private Pilot or Private Pilot candidate, or to any advanced pilot as a refresher of the basics.<br />The only complaints I have heard from students are in regard to the relatively high price of the book. My response is that this one book contains the best explanations of the most important concepts needed to pass your written, oral, and practical exams before becoming a Private Pilot, and is an excellent reference to be referred to in the days to come. Flying isn't cheap. Economy is a good thing, but you need to know when to skimp and when to spend. This book is an excellent investment.	2004-06-05

Chances are if you are reading this book it will be for a collegiate research class. Do not even think of buying this for use outside of school; there are many more useful and practical research books available at much more reasonable prices.<br />I used this in a graduate research methods class, and found it devoid of much practical information, instead being filled with a lot of meaningless doubletalk that has (unfortunately) come to dominate a high percentage of social science textbooks in the last twenty years. The advice on research and study design is useful for only extremely narrow types of studies, and may or may not help a student prepare for a thesis or dissertation (I am guessing it will not help more people than will find it helpful.)<br />To add insult to injury the book is patronizing and tends to talk down to students particularly in the insultingly stupid and simplistic faux case studies it uses. In particular, the 'MindWriter' study with &quot;Myra Wines&quot; reads more like a very poorly written soap opera than legitimate business case study, and insults the intelligence of students. (Particularly galling is the wholly implausible situation in which Myra finds herself solving an expended munition problem in the Army. Clearly from reading this, the authors should know more about their subject matter before creating these vignettes.) Most people who use this book could do entirely without these manufactured, extremely politically correct case studies. They in no way enhance learning.<br />Another major issue is the actual presentation of the text. McGraw Hill should be ashamed of the way this book looks. There are random text boxes breaking up the chapters all over the place (most often with useless information), pointless and often indecipherable flowcharts abound (an excellent example of this is the questionable flow of lines on Exhibit 3-7, 'Research Proposal Process', or the labyrinthine Exhibit 5-1, 'Ethical Issues and the Research Process', neither of which help make anything clearer), and extremely poor font and color choices. Here I refer to the dubious decision to use red ink to print inset quotations. Evidently McGraw Hill doesn't know that in many studies, red has been found to be one of the most difficult to read colors, and detracts from comprehension. Besides that, what's the point? I can read black ink just as well, it costs less, and it is already inset so I can see it is differentiated at a glance. None of that, however, is as bad as the selection of pink paper for many of the ancillary sections (normally case studies and the like) sprinkled liberally throughout the book at inconvenient places. This is dreadful. Not only is this difficult to read, but it is hard to highlight. Of course all these things make the book vastly more expensive. Textbook publishers would do well to knock off the fancy typesetting tricks and get back to basics while making their books less expensive. I don't mind paying $136.00 for a book, but I do want to get a good value. (Of course this isn't the only textbook that has fallen into this trap.)<br />All told I gave this book two stars. It really is a sub par book, and I did consider giving it one star, but it occasionally contains a real gem of a thought that makes it more worthwhile than a single star book would be. I believe that this book is in dire need of a good editor. It is 857 pages long, and could easily be reduced to 300 pages by sorting the wheat from the chaff. At 300 pages this would probably be a very good and practical book, at 857, it is obese. If you have a choice of book to use for a given course, I would not select this one. It is of limited utility and it requires vastly too much effort to glean required knowledge.

Textbook publishers would do well to knock off the fancy typesetting tricks and get back to basics while making their books less expensive. I don't mind paying $136.00 for a book, but I do want to get a good value. (Of course this isn't the only textbook that has fallen into this trap.)<br />All told I gave this book two stars. It really is a sub par book, and I did consider giving it one star, but it occasionally contains a real gem of a thought that makes it more worthwhile than a single star book would be. I believe that this book is in dire need of a good editor. It is 857 pages long, and could easily be reduced to 300 pages by sorting the wheat from the chaff. At 300 pages this would probably be a very good and practical book, at 857, it is obese. If you have a choice of book to use for a given course, I would not select this one. It is of limited utility and it requires vastly too much effort to glean required knowledge. Avoid if possible.	2004-06-03

She is also quick to point out that the book is essentially suited to a Master's thesis. I will point out that in programs that have de-emphasized thesis writing, instead relying on a written 'Graduate Research Project' (GRP, which also goes by other names), generally of smaller scope than a thesis,  this is also very applicable.<br />The focus of the book is making the dissertation or thesis as painless as possible. Dr. Ogden has advised scores of Ph.D. candidates on their dissertations, and her tips are on the money. She focuses on how to strategically and tactically plan your dissertation by focusing on what suitable topics are, and particularly emphasizes how to pick your advisor and committee (if you have a choice), how to focus your topic to manageable size, how to design your study and methodology, how to minimize required changes along the way, time line construction, and preparing for the oral defense. After reading the book, I came away with a new approach to this subject for myself, and I truly believe that this book is the most useful I have read on the subject, certainly more so than most formal research methods books. Having said that, I do believe her time line is quite tight. Although it sounds plausible to complete the dissertation in two semesters, I truly believe that in most cases it may require more, particularly in some scientific disciplines where the basic research can add substantially to that time line. Nonetheless, even if it does take you longer, the techniques and tips in this book will save you countless hours if you heed their wisdom.<br />I was on the borderline between four and five stars as a rating for this book, and though I love the book and highly recommend it, I settled on four. The reasons for the one star downgrade ore fairly straightforward: first, the book was originally published in 1993, and reprinted in 2002, making it out of date with regard to personal computer and printer technology and methodology (for instance it recommends daisy wheel printers); and secondly, the book is largely geared to examples of educational studies (although there are a few others including biology and ecology studies) to illustrate the authors points. The large bulk of these examples involve empirical study of large populations using statistical treatments (though there are no statistics in the book itself). This is great if you are a geneticist or psychologist, for example, but it applies less to a historian or language major. She very much promotes statistical treatments of empirical data whenever possible, and doesn't delve deeply into case study type dissertations, which are very common.<br />Overall, this is a great book. It is concise, easy to use, and universally applicable in the vast majority of concepts discussed. I highly recommend that any graduate student buy this book and read it before starting their dissertation or thesis. It will pay for itself many times over!hed in 1993, and reprinted in 2002, making it out of date with regard to personal computer and printer technology and methodology (for instance it recommends daisy wheel printers); and secondly, the book is largely geared to examples of educational studies (although there are a few others including biology and ecology studies) to illustrate the authors points.

Mark W. Smith is a trial attorney (yes, there are a few conservative lawyers left) and applies legal reasoning in most of his chapters as well as heavy doses of both deductive and inductive reasoning.<br />The book is full of excellent general information (and specific details specific to each chapter are detailed in summary form at the close of the chapters) and is designed as a convenient to read debunker of liberal myths. In general the book is very successful at doing just that, although I would have preferred a little more deductive reasoning  in a few places with more clearly labeled premises, illustrated reasoning, and conclusions and fewer catchy statistics and facts. Nonetheless, for what it is, it is an excellent effort, and I recommend it. I generally agree with most of his positions (with a couple of notable exceptions) and enjoyed reading all of his positions and justifications. I particularly like that the book makes the reader think. It requires active intellectual thought to ponder what Smith is saying, and to form conclusions of your own. In other words, you don't have to agree with him to appreciate this book: by virtue of reading it, it requires any serious reader to more deeply consider their positions, and regardless of whether or not you are in lockstep with Smith or not, that's a good thing.<br />The best feature of the book for my money are the notes at the end of the book giving useful website addresses and further reading you may wish to consider. I have never seen all that information in one location before, and I consider it a very useful addition to the book and much more than a mere appendix.<br />I look forward to hearing more from Mark W. Smith.	2004-05-29

The beauty of this book over all others is the methodology of asking top corporate recruiters their opinions of the different programs (some of which are eye opening and controversial). This more readily gives someone seeking an MBA the relative value of a specific MBA in the marketplace, not as ranked by some elitist academic survey.<br />Of course, all these programs are excellent, and I think anyone would find some issue to quibble with in the rankings or synopses, but all told this is an enormously useful and complete source of information. No MBA candidate should be without it.	2004-05-22

Initially beginning with one tyrannical rabbit, Binky, and eventually growing into a menagerie of rabbits, ducks, geese, turkeys, cats, parakeets, and assorted other creatures, Tarte relates all the joys and tribulations of being an animal lover. The relationships between the animals (especially the birds) are wonderfully recreated, as is the relationship between himself (and his wife) and all the animals. The joy of discovery when a new animal is brought into the fold (and the humorous exploits of accommodating all of them), the amazing scheduling impacts of all the animals on their lives, and the harsh reality of coping with the loss of a beloved animal are all poignantly told in a manner that makes it hard to put the book down.<br />I am a diehard animal lover, but my hat is off to the Tartes for the patience and love they show daily to their huge multi-specied zoo. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves animals!	2004-05-20

This is a compilation of some of Darby Conley's best strips; they are a joy to read and bring laughter into a frazzled day. The interaction of Rob, Satchel, and Bucky is a national treasure.<br />I particularly appreciate the tone of the strip in addressing social ills without being preachy, while still honoring the good things in America. Particularly noteworthy is the honor Mr. Conley bestows on the NYPD, EMS, and fire fighters throughout his strips, particularly post-9/11. I also appreciate his sensitivity in honoring the passing of truly significant people such as Douglas Adams (the '42' strip is wonderful), and Fred Rogers.<br />This is one of the most entertaining books on my bookshelf, and I treasure it. I could not recommend a book of comic strips more highly. Buy it: it'll make your day!	2004-05-20
US	52988732	R2B2TTJ0DENPXF	1893554856	45375245	Anti Americanism	Books	5	36	40	N	Y	The Most Important Book of 2003	&quot;Anti-Americanism&quot; by Jean-Francois Revel is the most important book of 2003. (It was originally published in France in 2000; this translation was released in the US in 2003 with added information.) Revel exposes the willful disregard for the truth found in European governments (especially France) and the tendency to criticize America first at every opportunity for every reason imaginable, even when the criticisms are, in fact mutually exclusive. The book is illustrated with numerous examples, and is impeccably documented (mostly from French publications). My only wish is that it had an index, although footnotes are abundant with source information.<br />Throughout the book Revel makes it quite clear that when America does something wrong it should be criticized: he never flinches from doing so when he believes it is inappropriate; for (just one) example, he believes the death penalty is wrong, and criticizes the US for having it. Fair enough, the man is entitled to his opinion. The point that he goes on to make is that it is the American use of the death penalty that gets cries of derision from Europe and human rights groups, while countries that have wholesale executions, such as China, North Korea, Iran, and Saddam's Iraq get nary a second glance from the Europeans. That is a perhaps minor point in the great scope of world events (though not to the people involved), but there are many more vivid and complex examples of Anti-American bias discussed that are too long to go into here. The point to be made is this: read the book with an open mind and you will gain a new perspective on European governments and elites, as well as the infiltration of socialism and Marxism into all facets of the European left (and academia and the media virtually universally.)<br />Criticism of this book in these reviews is fairly predictable: people who actually read the book generally give Revel his deserved high marks for analysis and accuracy, and the overwhelming majority of one star reviews are one liners with no insight or critique, rather just an obvious liberal political ax to grind. One reviewer, though, piqued my interest; when he called Revel a &quot;French Uncle Tom&quot; and a &quot;bought-off Frog&quot;: I wondered where he got his information and exactly who bought Revel off and for what purpose. He certainly would have sold more books in France, his chief market, if he had been hostile to the US (read the book again). This reviewer also makes a statement about the &quot;fortunate Halliburton stockholders&quot; rebuilding Iraq. I am not so sure how 'fortunate' Halliburton stockholders are inasmuch as the company lost $928 million last year and the stock under performed the S&amp;P 500 last year by a substantial margin (although analysts now believe it is poised for a comeback, in the interest of full disclosure.) My point is this: in direct contrast to this reviewer and other leftists of his ilk, Revel deals in actual historical facts, not in propaganda strewn diatribes full of jingoistic fervor with no actual basis in the real world. That is why this book is so valuable: it is a real, honest, refreshing look at the actual situation in Europe from a knowledgeable insider, not a vitriolic piece of mindless propaganda.<br />This should be the next book you read.y of one star reviews are one liners with no insight or critique, rather just an obvious liberal political ax to grind.

The book is relatively brief, but full of vital information. It details aptitudes and preparation needed for architecture school, as well as the educational process and internship and licensing processes used in the profession. She also details information about allied professions such as urban and land use planners, landscape architects, and historic preservationists.<br />Central to the book are a series of interviews with a number of practicing architects in different specialties and at different points in their careers, which is very interesting and useful for focusing on areas of the profession most interesting to a specific reader. Also included are several listings of professional organizations, architecture schools, etc., along with contact information for each of them, in what may be the single most useful feature of the book.<br />The book is certainly enlightening regarding all aspects of the profession, and in some cases is nothing short of eye opening, for instance in the area of salary, in which the author reveals that a beginning architect can expect to make only $25,000 to $35,000 annually after completing school, a figure well below most other professions. Despite the salary wake up call, architecture still comes across as a vibrant, interesting career field, and any reader considering a career in architecture would be well advised to read this book.	2004-05-16

It's hard to top fridge toting, but &quot;One Hit Wonderland&quot;, while occasionally amusing, really doesn't measure up to his earlier works.<br />Tony had a top 5 hit in the UK in 1988 with his group 'Morris Minor and the Majors'. It was a comic parody (kind of like a British 'Weird Al Yankovic' concept) of the Beastie Boys. What was the song title, you may well ask? It was called &quot;Stutter Rap.&quot; Need I say more? (You can hear it on Hawks' website, directions are found in the book.) In this book he takes another bet (surprise!) this time attempting to have a top 20 hit anywhere in the world within two years. Many odd comic misadventures ensue with trips to Nashville, Amsterdam, Romania, and the Sudan, before finally finding a compilation with famous composer Sir Tim Rice, and English movie star (from the 1950's or so) Norman Wisdom doing the trick, rising to number 18 in Albania.<br />The book is sort of like &quot;Stutter Rap&quot; in that Hawks' musical career went downhill fast after that song; likewise, this book is a decided plunge from his earlier writing efforts. There are amusing portions of the book, but he generally comes across as a bit of a prat, and frequently a bit condescending, particularly to the United States, and most particularly to Christians. I didn't really find it a bit amusing when, during his Nashville foray, for instance, he entered a church during worship specifically to mock it, nor was I amused when he mocked an older woman working in a Christian book store. If this is what he is resorting to for humor, then, I doubt I will really need to examine his next book too closely.<br />Three stars, but I seriously considered two. The adventures with Tim Rice and Norman Wisdom in Albania really pulled it back from the edge.	2004-05-05

What was less obvious, though, was how accurate this book was in many ways, most particularly in rural Minnesota. Although I wasn't born in Minnesota, I now love it and consider myself an adopted Minnesotan, but after nine years I am still learning to master the subtle complexities of Minnesota interactions so perfectly defined in this book.<br />Howard Mohr (&quot;Creator of Minnesota Language Systems&quot;), a brilliant writer for 'A Prairie Home Companion,' details all the basics of talking Minnesotan form the viewpoint of a visitor. After reading this book, you will: learn how to refuse food three times before accepting it; learn to reduce anxiety with the all-purpose reaction &quot;it could be worse&quot;; learn proper conduct at Bob's B-17 Park, the Particle Board Pageant, and the Deep Woods Tent Casino; and learn the proper way of accepting a gift from a Minnesotan (hint: never call it a gift).<br />There are wonderful examples of all linguistic areas provided as well as guides to where to go in Minnesota, Minnesota dating etiquette, and an overview of Minnesotan cuisine, including detailed explanations of various hotdish concepts unseen outside Minnesota. This is a wonderful book, with more than a little humor and more than a little truth in it. I love Minnesota, and I love this book. It's a heckuva deal.	2004-05-01

While I still hold most of my earlier opinions, I have a couple of other insights after the second reading.<br />First, the PowerPoint slides on the included CD are very useful, and are generally well done, but they do contain a number of errors, which should have definitely been caught.<br />Second, the book gets more mathematically oriented as it goes on, and by the time the reader gets to about Chapter 9, the book makes so many assumptions about mathematical background (that may not be safely assumed, even in Business schools) that the example problems and, more importantly, explanations given, are very difficult to grasp: the chapter on forecasting is the peak of indecipherability. Some problems will just say something like 'using calculus...' and then show what happened as a result (this is especially true in the PowerPoint slides, by the way). What I am saying is that people who have recently had advanced calculus and statistics won't have a problem, but anyone who has been away from higher math for a couple of years will struggle.<br />Third, many of the case studies, while very well written and illuminating, are clearly taken from company specific corporate public relations fodder. In other words, they frequently read like propaganda. Don't get me wrong, I very much like the case studies, they just seem a bit stilted, though frequently they are the strongest part of a chapter.<br />Fourth, the book is absolutely strewn with buzzwords. I understand the needs to use specific terms to define specific concepts, and these authors are far from being alone in this misdeed, but sometimes speaking clear English actually helps a student understand the information. I absolutely draw the line when the authors call 'eyeballing' a line on a graph &quot;Ocular Heuristic Approximation&quot; (OHA). (Just a tip for the authors before they write the next edition.)<br />Finally, the book is filled with color and expensive printing tricks throughout, like color type, inset boxes, lots of color graphs and charts (some of which are redundant), and the like. My point here is that this stuff, while generally nice to look at is not value added, and dramatically raises the price of the book (mine was $135.00) with no increase in value to the students. For Mr. Chase and the rest of the authors: read your own book. Understand what the consumer (in this case students) want and need, and write that book. Don't fill a book with tons of color and fancy typographical tricks and drive the price through the roof. There are many other Operations Management books available for half the price and I recommended a couple of specific titles in my course critique. The book may look nice, but it isn't worth this price.<br />In summation, I now give this book three stars. It is very comprehensive, and there is a lot of good information between it's covers. If you can grasp the advanced math, put up with the buzzwords, and deal with paying $135 for a single book, this really isn't too bad./>Finally, the book is filled with color and expensive printing tricks throughout, like color type, inset boxes, lots of color graphs and charts (some of which are redundant), and the like.

The photos are breathtaking, many involving animals, many human interest shots, or even an occasional landscape. My favorites have to be the 'polar bear waltz' photo by Frans Lanting in Hudson Bay, Canada (p.77), the 'smiling saguaro' by Joe McDonald taken in Arizona (p. 79), the 'north pole' shot by Per Breihagen (pp. 72-73), and the 'whimsical ostrich' shot by Kevin Horan taken in Addington, Oklahoma (p.45). All of the shots in this book are great, but perhaps the most touching is the photo from Mount Elbert, Colorado by Dave Showalter on September 16, 2001 (p.96), surely one of the most inspiring photographs I have ever seen.<br />This is a beautiful and affordable book of some of the most truly amazing and stunning, sometimes playful, sometimes serious, but always magnificent photographs that I have ever seen.

It is a lavishly illustrated (albeit in black and white) comprehensive work detailing every style of American home in drawings, sections, and elevations emphasizing the differences that make a certain home or style unique. In this way it is extremely useful for anyone with even a passing interest in architecture to learn about the varying styles of American homes.<br />Mr. Walker does not visibly seem to favor any one style over another, and avoids editorializing for the most part. Instead he seems to love all the differing styles for what they are, in different ways, and for different reasons, depending of the particular house in question. In addition to specifics on certain examples and styles, Mr. Walker also gives the reader a historical perspective of housing developments in a developmental time frame, starting with Pueblo and Tipi styles to the Inflatable, Deconstruction, Brutalism, and Neomodern styles that are decidedly more recent. As a fan of creative contemporary architecture, I especially found the coverage of the International Revival movement, the quirky Silo and Yurt homes of the early 1970s, and Fantasy homes from the 1940s in the shapes of an elephant (Margate City, NJ), Mother Goose (Hazard, KY), and a pig (Los Angeles, CA), among others, to be delightful.<br />This is a wonderful volume and I highly endorse it to anyone from architectural historian to collectors of Americana.	2004-04-23

In this short book, Jan Carlzon relates how he righted three travel companies as CEO by listening to the knowledge accumulated by frontline employees and helping them do their jobs, rather than the other way around. Mr. Carlzon was spectacular in turning around the fortunes of Vingresor, Linjeflyg, and finally SAS. As head of SAS he was able to dispense with business as usual by listening more to the frontline employees, and scrupulously insisting on removing 'yes-men' from his inner circle, a policy that has also served Southwest amazingly well over the years. Although his tenure was not totally without controversy, Carlzon talks frankly about unions (he looks on them as partners and long-term stakeholders), and tough decisions, such as sticking with the trusted DC-9 when other airlines were buying newer planes merely for the sake of having newer planes, despite negative balance sheet implications.<br />This is a book that should be read by every business major, MBA, and airline employee about what is possible by working together. Sadly in recent US history most airline executives have been self-centered boors who don't care about the airline business, and have no long term stake in the company. Largely they have stayed around a couple of years, raked in millions (in some cases hundreds of millions) of dollars and then left a bankrupt or weak carrier in the lurch. Carlzon makes it clear that he is a capitalist, but a capitalist that realizes that if management and employees work together, solutions can be reached that will benefit all over the long term.<br />To the Boards of Directors of any airline anywhere I say this: read this book, learn how it should be done, and go out and get a Carlzon-school thinker for every executive position in your company. The long term results will amaze you. I could not recommend this book any more highly.	2004-04-23

Most of them are amusing anecdotes on life in America, and especially wistful recalling of life in America as he knew it twenty years ago contrasted with the present day. In his world, the present generally is inferior, though there is quite a bit of self doubting in his opinion pieces (notably especially when discussing motels and drive-in movies) and occasionally praise for modernity (look hard.)<br />When he sticks to wry commentary on humorous topics (the IRS, computers, customer service, etc.) he is hilarious; kind of a more urbane Dave Barry. I was on a few occasions irritated with the book, and each time it was on one of two topics: air travel or immigration. He has nothing good to say about traveling by plane (and sometimes I would agree with him), and he goes to great lengths, for instance, to complain that he arrived at an airport with no photo ID, and had difficulty getting on the plane. (Who travels by plane without a photo ID?) In fact on several occasions he blames others for misfortunes caused patently by his own (frequently admitted) ineptness, ignorance, or forgetfulness. I find it perfectly reasonable that if you show up for a flight with no photo ID, that you don't get on the plane. He took the attitude that the security forces were inept, loser idiots who should have known who he was, and clearly should have made an exception for him, a celebrity. He goes as far as to contrast this to the UK where he relates a tale of a customs agent telling him to lie to get into the country and praising him for his efficiency. This truly rubbed me the wrong way, and I hope he would not have been so foolish to write that after 9/11. He is also goes off on a rant against people opposed to immigration in the US, saying that so little of the country is built up that we should, essentially, let anyone that wants to come in feel welcome. Mind you, this is the same guy who, just a few pages away who laments how built up the country is getting and how terrible it is. Nobody noticed this seeming contradictory position during editing, for some reason. He also thinks that it is unreasonable to deny benefits to illegal aliens, ignoring that in the state of Arizona alone, the cost of medical care for illegals is almost $1 Billion (of  US taxpayer dollars) annually, and that in the Southwest an enormously disproportionate amount of crime is the work of illegals. I realize his wife is English, and I appreciate his toils to get her into the country legally, but to impugn that anyone opposed to illegal immigration is a cretin, is ignorant at best and insulting at worst. Hey, Bill, one more time: unlike your wife, the vast majority of immigration foes are talking about people here ILLEGALLY!<br />Having said that, overall I liked the book, and will almost certainly buy more Bryson books. Some of the gems are truly worth reading and re-reading, particularly the address he gave to a high school graduation. I think it's worth four stars, and it would have been worth five easily if it wasn't for some of the pompous self-righteousness in a couple of the chapters.

Columnist James Lileks has hit a home run with this pungent assemblage of comestible horrors. Noted for his amusing website ([...] the author has been collecting humorous bits of Americana for a while, and this is essentially the greatest hits of horrifying food that he has thus far uncovered. The book is very tongue in cheek and profusely illustrated with recipes for and photographs of hideous and disgusting real recipes that somebody thought were a good idea at the time, but in retrospect seem amazingly daft.<br />The book is divided into chapters largely by food type (\\"Poultry for the Glum\\", \\"All the Smart People Eat Toast\\", \\"Glop in a Pot!\\", etc.) but there a couple organized more by genre (\\"Swanson's Parade of Lost Identity\\", \\"Eat Brains and Whip Hitler!\\", etc.) All told there are 192 pages of revolting and hilarious monstrosities of the kitchen. Most are descriptions and photos of the dishes, while some include the actual recipes. I actually wish more of the recipes were included, as I can't imagine what ingredients make up some of these dishes, the sardine dish on p. 76, for instance, the appearance of which is accurately described as \\"piscine torsos in a vinyl sauce colored with melted peach crayons.\\" Some of the recipes, on the other hand, find the reader wishing they knew a bit less about the contents of the dish, for instance on p. 31 under the heading 'Aspic Entrees', the recipes for \\"Tongue Mousse\\" and \\"Jellied Calf's Liver\\" spring to mind readily.<br />This book is a wonderful addition to any library; I plan on putting mine among my cookbooks for easy future reference! Highly recommended!	2004-04-07

They cover the actual requirements for education, internships (generally an architect must serve a full time three year internship before taking his or her licensing examinations), and licensing. They further discuss what particular aptitudes a person should have to consider an architectural career in an excellent section where abilities in math and drawing are discussed.<br />My favorite feature of the book is the inclusion of information on career options beyond private practice, particularly in urban and land use planning, historic conservation, project management, and governmental regulation. Also discussed are salary ranges, requirements for school entrance, and a section on all accredited schools of architecture in the United States (110) and Canada (8). My only negative comment on the book is that internet contact information is not provided for the schools, but that is a minor point.<br />The target audience for this book is young people, mostly high school students, and college students with undecided majors, however, I am a mid-career professional in a totally unrelated field, who found it useful for information on career transitions (I am considering eventual early retirement from one career and returning to school in architecture, as after I complete my MBA I am considering project management as a specialty.)<br />The book is brief, and easily read in one sitting, but is full of practical information on this field. Anyone considering a career in architecture would be well served by reading it.	2004-04-07

This is the third edition of 'Aardvark', otherwise known as 'Aardvark 3', and is one of the strangest books that I have ever seen. Melbourne is one of the greatest cities in the world for unusual and beautiful modern architecture, so I leapt at the chance to own my own copy of 'Aardvark 3' without having much information to really base my decision on. The first thing you should know about this book is its unconventional nature: the book itself is about 5 1/2&quot; x 4 3/4&quot; x 1&quot; in size and it is accompanied by a CD-ROM. It is also enclosed in a cardboard slipcase for a nice, if quirky, presentation. My major issue with the format is that because the pages are so tiny the information becomes rather difficult to read, especially close to the binding.<br />The material is generally excellent. The book is broken down geographically by region, and includes buildings of every description imaginable as well as information on their construction and the designing architectural firm. My personal favorites from an aesthetic standpoint are the eleven story office building at 91-97 William St. by Denton Corker Marshall, the beautiful Choong house (in which the apparent collision and cantilever of disparate elements is balanced perfectly against the undulation of the central spinal wall) by Biltmoderne (it is also featured on the CD-ROM), and the quirky St. Kilda Toilet Block in the St. Kilda Botanical Gardens, an unusual study in organic blending with the surroundings, by the firm of Wood Marsh.<br />The CD-ROM has unique color illustrations of several structures, including the Choong house, the gorgeous curvilinear Elthan Library, a study in beautiful efficiency in a compact private residence by John Wardle, and possibly my favorite of all, the exquisite Frantzeskos house also by Wood Marsh. Unfortunately, since 'Aardvark 3' was released in 1997, Windows 95 was the operating system of choice at the time, and using the CD-ROM with Windows XP is quite frustrating. The index functions do not work correctly in my personal experience, either with or without an internet connection, and the amount of information that I was able to actually see with Windows XP is a fraction of that actually available, which is a shame.<br />'Aardvark 3' is a valuable, if costly, little reference book on one of the most vital cities in the world for contemporary architecture. I recommend it to anyone interested in great architecture with the caveat that it is small, and the CD-ROM may prove difficult to use.at the time, and using the CD-ROM with Windows XP is quite frustrating.

It also deals with several other tick-borne illnesses such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Q fever, and babesiosis. Unlike most readers, I have a unique perspective on this work as a former suffer of Lyme disease due to a tick bite I got while hiking in the St. Croix River valley of Minnesota in 1998. Fortunately, my physician, a gifted diagnostician, promptly tested for Lyme disease, and after a treatment of antibiotics (and anti-inflammatory drugs for the migratory arthritic pain involved), I became Lyme free after a careful prescription and testing regimen. It is with that background that I read &quot;Bull's Eye&quot;, and I heartily endorse it as the best historical treatment of Lyme disease I have yet seen. I also have the benefit of being a biologist by education, so I was already acquainted with most of the terminology involved. This book is excellent for Doctors and other medical professionals, and is totally suitable to the layman as well, although someone with limited background may end up re-reading sections and flipping to the Appendix and Glossary occasionally.<br />The book is really a medical detective story, and a gripping one at that. It begins with the symptoms of an unknown disease clustered around Lyme, Connecticut in the mid 1970s. Initially believed to be Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA), authorities began questioning that diagnosis after demographic patterns were not consistent with JRA, and the disease exhibited significant clustering (which JRA does not do.) Initially brought to the attention of authorities by two area mothers, Polly Murray and Judith Mensch, their initial concerns were rebuffed. Through their perseverance, ultimately several teams of doctors began investigating the illness, believed to be linked to an insect vector due to the geographic distribution of the illness and the seasonality of the illness. Navy Doctors William Mast and William Burrows were quick to realize the curative effect of antibiotics on the disease, though not all doctors agreed. Notably Dr. Allan Steere of the Yale rheumatology department believed that antibiotics were not indicated until four years worth of data were analyzed. Although in 20/20 hindsight this is an obvious gaffe, I am sympathetic to the conundrum faced by Dr. Steere, as obviously he didn't want to prescribe unnecessary antibiotics. Where I am not sympathetic to Dr. Steere is in his seemingly arrogant, quick dismissal of the Navy doctors and their corporate and medical knowledge, particularly in light of their ninety percent cure rate with antibiotic therapy. I am somewhat academically amused that Steere and the Yale 'experts' were generally incorrect in most of their initial assumptions. Although I am personally grateful for the work of all the researchers involved, including Dr. Steere, I was exceptionally impressed with Mast and Burrows in addition to noted tick expert Dr. Willy Burgdorfer (after whom the Lyme disease spirochete is named) and his efforts to find the agent responsible for the disease. Working with ticks is extremely difficult: they are small, hard, and contaminated with a gazillion things. Isolating the one agent being searched for, in this case an unknown spirochete, is extraordinarily difficult.<br />Dr. Edlow is an excellent writer and anyone with interest in the medical field would love this book. The doctor who treated my Lyme disease recently left practice. When he left I went to see him specifically to thank him for all his efforts on my behalf and to give him a copy of &quot;Bull's Eye.&quot; It was the least I could do.ctor due to the geographic distribution of the illness and the seasonality of the illness.

Is it a book on transformational grammar for linguists? Is it a book of miscommunications, and the resultant impact on aviation safety? Is it a book on computer programming? Actually, it's all three. I bought the book to read from an air safety standpoint, given that I am an airline pilot. I found the book very interesting but very tough reading in parts, and occasionally a bit unfocused. The book is in three parts, plus a very long technical appendix. The first part concerns itself with language use, and includes many examples from not only NTSB Accident Reports, but from ASRS 'Callback' (published by NASA) that were from incidents. Although I generally agree on all his points and would highly encourage all pilots and Air Traffic Controllers to heed his warnings (and to examine their speech for potential errors of the types Dr. Cushing points out) there are a couple of minor exceptions I take to statements he makes or assumptions he has about pilot-controller language use, particularly in reference to the word &quot;hold&quot; in the Air California gear up landing accident. Overall, though, it is a brilliant analysis. Part two is similar to part one in that it focuses on communication problems not related to language (numbers, radios, etc.). Both parts one and two are four chapters long per part. The analysis in part two is my favorite part of the book, and relates issues such as transposed digits, limitations of radios, the 10 versus 11 problem so common in altitude violations, etc. This is the part that has unparalleled insight into pilot-controller communications interactions and the foibles that can result. Every pilot and controller should read part two.<br />Part three deals with proposed solutions to the problem, and in this section he details a machine that can interpret language, check grammar, sentence structure, and meaning before allowing a message to be transmitted. He admits that this is a long time in the future, and proposes a short term data link system. I realize the machine he developed, while excellent research, is a prototype, but with all respect to the efforts of Dr. Cushing and his graduate students, I feel he may be barking up the wrong tree. The constructs of the machine are so complex, and the commands and menu options he envisions are so unwieldy that I can't imagine a machine that checks grammar and content of every transmission, and won't (at least to my understanding) let any non-database words pass its parser, being fast enough to keep up with the Air Traffic Control needs of Jackson, MS, much less LaGuardia at five in the afternoon. I am absolutely not closed minded on this subject, and am a huge proponent of CPDLC, which was in testing by American Airlines and Miami Center last year. I would love to see a revised edition of the book (it was published in 1994) with the latest technology added and the computer programs he developed to be updated and possibly integrated with CPDLC. The appendix is a very detailed (excruciating to a non-computer programmer) explanation of the constructs of his lab test system containing two computers that could converse with each other via the data link system and menus he developed. I read it, but only marginally grasped the material. The appendix information is best ignored by pilots and controllers, although it is probably very insightful to programmers and linguists.<br />Overall it is the best book I have seen on the role of communications in aviation accidents, and I give it four stars for two reasons only: one, it diverges into a computer programming book in the last third of the text, which I had not expected given the summaries of the work I had read; and two, Dr. Cushing numbers every line of transcript throughout the book and then makes reference to that numbered line in the discussion. This is fine when the discussion is near the quotation, but often he refers to a line number that you read about fifty pages earlier instead of reprinting the quotation which makes the reader fumble back and forth looking for the line in question. This is an excellent work overall, just understand that it is technical reading and requires a basic understanding of 'aviation English' and grammar to fully comprehend the author's discussions and analyses. I eagerly look forward to reading more by Dr. Cushing in the future.line number that you read about fifty pages earlier instead of reprinting the quotation which makes the reader fumble back and forth looking for the line in question.

I am unsure what criteria were used to select the stories in this volume, but largely the results are amusing to hysterical. My favorite, hands down was the Bill Bryson piece titled &quot;What's Cooking?&quot; (&quot;We have a crepe galette of sea chortle and kelp in a rich mal de mer sauce...&quot;), though almost as funny were &quot;A Train, A Frog, and Aliens&quot; by Randy Wayne White, and &quot;Bad Haircuts Around the World&quot; by Doug Lansky. Many of the other pieces were also quite funny, and a few only modestly amusing, though generally sincere. A couple were downright unpleasant, namely editor Tim Cahill's own &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot; and especially the almost unendurable J. P. Donleavy piece &quot;The Fox Hunt&quot;, which was not only distasteful and crude, but not a trifle funny.<br />By and large this is an entertaining travelogue, and I recommend it. It is particularly good for a short plane trip, as it will take about two or three hours to read. Parts are genius, but just know that other parts are occasionally a bit of a drag.	2004-03-31

The book is approximately twelve inches square, and can easily be mistaken for a (very large and heavy) coffee table book from afar. Once it is opened, though, it is obvious that this in no trifling work. It contains background and narrative on Shackleton and the expedition and all of the surviving Hurley photographs (almost 500 of them total) and in scope is the most complete and amazing account of the expedition I have ever seen.<br />The text is enlightening and wonderful, but the photographs are the unmistakable stars of the book. Hurley was taken along to document the expedition, and document it he did, despite the fact that it turned out completely differently than any of the men would have ever wanted or imagined. The photographs range from breathtakingly beautiful pictures of water and ice, to fascinating character studies, particularly of life aboard the ship, to poignant photos that are impossible to view without being choked up, of which I place the photos of the dogs and cat at the top, realizing that all the animals, their most faithful of friends, were ultimately killed on Shackleton's orders to conserve food (many of the dogs were eaten.) It is truly fortunate that Hurley was along to document the voyage; mere words alone could never do justice to one of the greatest survival stories ever told, and certainly the most harrowing that I can imagine.<br />The book is a timeless masterpiece and belongs on the bookshelf of anyone with an interest in the Antarctic, polar exploration, or man's ability to endure untold hardships yet emerge victorious over the elements.	2004-03-27

Written long before 9/11 and his coming of age as a more conservative voice, this is a fairly libertarian, rational, and practical look at life in the United States. There are a few areas that I disagree with him on, but I am not recommending that anyone think a certain way, just that people hear different concepts with an open mind and make their own decisions. In this book you can see the seeds of Miller's conservatism, although it is clear that he has been awakened and revitalized by the events of 9/11 and is thus more conservative now than when this book was written.<br />Overall, this is a neat summary of Miller's world view as it existed in 1996. His gift of satire is preeminent in the world today, and while probably everyone will find something in this book to provoke or annoy them, at least it insists on the reader thinking for themselves. I would have given this book five stars except for the fairly frequent profanity. I know this is adapted from some of his HBO material, but the book could be used for a much younger audience to excellent effect if not for the language. Excellent job overall: highly recommended for people of any political leaning.	2004-03-26

I can't praise this little book enough. In its pages are the best explanations and analyses of contrasts, textures, shapes, and colors that I have seen in one single, condensed location.<br />Originally published in Denmark in 1959, and therefore lacking some of the more contemporary and postmodern design trends, this is an invaluable analysis of primarily European design through the mid twentieth century. This book is profusely illustrated with black and white photographs (most of which were taken by Rasmussen himself) and a fair number of drawings, all of which greatly assist the reader with his understanding of the material.<br />Specific buildings mentioned are too numerous to list, but the run the gamut from St. Peter's basilica in Rome, to the haunting and sinister Palazzetto Zuccari (also in Rome), to the ultramodern Johnson Wax Company building in Racine, Wisconsin by Frank Lloyd Wright, and the very modern study in open spaces found in the Copenhagen Police Headquarters (one of my personal favorites.)<br />This would be a useful guide to architects, and is the single best introduction to historical architectural style that I have yet found. Anyone with even a passing interest in architectural design or history would love this book.	2004-03-12

The ninth edition is very comprehensive; however I recommend you get the most current (tenth) edition in which the authors have emphasized recent innovations in e-commerce and the internet. The text is well written, with less obfuscation than most books of this genre. The organization is quite good, with numerous graphs, charts and photos to illustrate the thrust of the subject matter.<br />I really like the excellent applicable case studies cited as examples in the text. These really helped with comprehension on the material. The CD has some expanded spreadsheets, presentations for the various chapters, and miscellaneous other items of interest. Candidly, I have really not used the CD much, but it is a nice resource to have.<br />Detractors for the book include the degree of statistical background and comprehension that students are presumed to have when they begin using the book (and the relatively poor mathematical explanations given for various formulas), the excessive price of the book, and the lack of clarity of some of the illustrations.<br />Overall, this is a good book, and I would recommend it, especially to a student with a strong mathematical background.	2004-03-11

Everything about it is absolutely splendid, from the cover photograph, to the last word of the index. I have always been a fan of bad movies, and I enjoy seeing what doesn't work cinematically as much as what does. This is a collection of Ebert's best reviews on the subject of what decidedly does not work.<br />Ebert is always a quick wit, and though I don't always agree with him, I always find his writing insightful to illuminating his point of view. In this book, though, I believe that I am in complete agreement on all the movies that I have seen. Indeed, some of these reviews are so well written and intriguing, I had to see the film in question just to know if it could be that bad. For instance after reading about the silly character names, the telepathic parrots and the man eating vegetables, I just HAD to see &quot;At The Earth's Core&quot;. It is unquestionably as wretched as Ebert says, and I delighted in its badness. I have now set my sights on &quot;North&quot;, but that is allegedly much harder to watch.<br />If you want an accounting of mostly big budget cinematic fiascoes, this is the book for you. I hope Ebert writes another book soon called 'More Movies I Hated, Hated, Hated.'	2004-03-11

This is the most wonderfully complete and comprehensible tax preparation guidebook on the market, and I buy the new edition every year. It never fails help me with the tortures of tax season. My favorite features are the wide margins that allow me to make notes in the book as I go. I also like the 'Caution' and 'Law Alert' notes in the margins pertinent to the matter being discussed. These clarify confusing issues (particularly about deductions) and make the tax code a mite more comprehensible. Other good features are the complete tax tables in the back of the book, a planning section, and a set of tax forms, although I personally don't use them as I traditionally use TurboTax.<br />My one minor critique is that sometimes an entry will refer you to a website to find the ultimate answer to a question. This is very rare, but does occasionally happen, for instance in this year's edition I needed some information on per diem reimbursement rates, and they weren't in the book, which was a mere annoyance, but at least the book told me where to get the information.<br />As tax preparation software becomes more all encompassing I use this book a little bit less every year, but at some point it always bails me out without fail. I highly recommend this book to anyone, especially people with moderately complex returns or small business owners filing Schedule C.	2004-03-11

Don't misunderstand me, I am all in favor of strict safety and anti-pollution measures, which are generally better today than when this book was written thirty years ago; I just was expecting that this book would discuss technical matters and life onboard to a greater extent than it did, and be more balanced in its appraisal of the shipping industry.<br />The book is shrill and alarmist. It dwells on the negative impact of oil in the ocean, decries the evils of Japan, Western Europe, and especially the United States, and their appetite for oil, and notes anecdotal information like that Africa and Asia use less oil per capita than the industrialized west. Of course what he never mentions is that those same Western societies at the time of publication produced an overwhelming majority of the world's goods. This is a book that wants to be &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, while trying to appeal to those with a technical interest in shipping.<br />I am interested in literature on the environmental impact of tankers, and particularly recommend &quot;Black Tide&quot; about the 'Torrey Canyon' as an excellent example of tanker related, balanced environmental reporting. What I don't like is a book that is ostensibly fair and balanced trying to sell me a shrill alarmist position that is anything other than balanced. In the book, for instance, Mostert goes on at length about studies that show that the oceans will be completely lifeless due to oil pollution in 25-30 years. That time has now past, and where marine species have decreased, the cause has overwhelmingly been over-fishing, not oil, with exceptions around refineries and spill areas. My point here isn't that oil is good for the oceans, but that his personal disdain for supertankers won't decrease the need for them: the solutions are in the disciplines of systems safety and crew training, with legislative assistance from governments and insurers, not in ridding the world of the tankers. Long term, of course, alternatives to oil will be found that will relegate these ships to the scrapper's torch, which is the good news; on that I am sure that Mostert would agree with me. I am for increased regulation and monitoring of tankers and agree totally with Mostert that the bulk of the problem is with ships flying flags of convenience (especially Liberia.) There is no question that these mammoth ships are capable of untold destruction, and for that reason I believe that the oil companies and the insurers (especially Lloyd's) need to carefully monitor not only the ships themselves, but the adequacy and training of the crews and the regulations and enforcement actions of the flags they sail under. If insurers make it less economically viable to use flags of convenience due to higher accident rates, safety can only then be improved.<br />There is good information in this book, particularly details of tanker losses and casualties, and also in the history of tankers and oil importation/exportation, but there is a grim hysteria about the horrible fate supertankers hold for the world, virtually none of which has actually come to pass.<br />I would very much like a new and revised edition to examine the current situation today, and to accurately summarize the strengths and fallacies of the original. If you are looking for a book on the functioning of tankers, look elsewhere. If you want a balanced book on the environmental impact of tankers, try &quot;Black Tide&quot;. If you want a look at modern (cargo) shipping as it exists today, try &quot;Colombo Bay.&quot; If you want a shrill, alarmist tome that accepts sources uncritically that further its cause, but is quick to dismiss evidence contrary to the opinion of the author, this is your book.he disciplines of systems safety and crew training, with legislative assistance from governments and insurers, not in ridding the world of the tankers.

Despite the claim that the book is 948 pages long, its printed length is actually 435 pages, which is still plenty hefty.<br />The conference from which the text of this book was taken occurred before the first flight of the shuttle 'Columbia', and is therefore greatly insightful into the early phases of shuttle planning, operations, and design. Needless to say, the program was wildly optimistic at the beginning, and this book reflects that misplaced optimism with papers presented on things like follow on STS derivatives, a 74 passenger shuttle variant (to ferry workers to all the work that would need to be done in space), and most fallacious of all, the concept of launch on demand, in which an orbiter could be launched with minutes notice. Also touted was the incredible economics of the shuttle which was supposed to reduce the cost per pound of orbited payload tenfold, when in reality, it has been more expensive than disposable boosters.<br />There is a great deal of technical information on the shuttle in the volume, accompanied by a very large number of excellent illustrations (for instance, external tank slosh baffles, and other hard to find photos and drawings), therefore, I highly recommend it for serious shuttle historians, but be forewarned that it is very heavy reading, and also contains numerous papers not related specifically to the shuttle on subjects as diverse as VAB reconfiguration, financial regulations pertaining to the operation of large platforms in space, and the excruciating &quot;Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System,&quot; which delves into way more detail on the functional configuration of TDRSS satellites than anyone ever wanted to know.<br />I gave it four stars overall. The shuttle material was interesting and not commonly known, so that part of the book rated five stars, but the large quantity of non-shuttle information of dubious historical significance brought it to a four star overall rating. This is an excellent shuttle reference overall, just be prepared for quite a bit of extraneous or marginally applicable material.e quantity of non-shuttle information of dubious historical significance brought it to a four star overall rating.

It is organized alphabetically, as you would expect, and has extensive explanations of most any aviation related term you can think of. As an aside, the only term I have tried to look up and have not found is &quot;RAT&quot; (Ram Air Temperature). It does include &quot;TAT&quot; (Total Air Temperature), but I was trying to find the definitive answer on how the two differ.<br />The lack of &quot;RAT&quot;, though, is (by far) the exception, as the book covers most all other topics more thoroughly and concisely than any other single volume I have found. This volume would be especially useful to people upgrading to complex aircraft (especially jets) for the first time. The section discussing FMS (Flight Management System) information and use would be very helpful to pilots transitioning to their first 'glass' airplane.  The book has hundreds of illustrations, and all key points requiring visual illustration seem to have an easy to grasp drawing, chart, diagram, or graph, as appropriate.<br />This book is useful to pilots at all levels, as it discusses the very basic things like the forces acting on an aircraft in flight, to advanced EFIS and FANS concepts. This book is a one stop reference goldmine for pilots. The chances are very high that if it isn't in here, it isn't that important for a pilot to know.	2004-02-25

If you have never seen Unarius (oops, UNARIUS...it's an acronym for something) you have really missed out. This is a photo tour of Unarius and their charismatic leader Ruth E. Norman.<br />Unarius is a weird new age thing. These folks basically are big reincarnation people and are always going on about the 'Space Brothers' and 'The Golden Vortex.' It seems that they believe that we are one of 33 worlds about to have a big galactic convention (in California, of course). They really enjoy dressing up as things like the Ambassador from the planet Po (really).<br />The book must be seen to be believed. I actually think that Ruth Norman was a nice lady who happened to be a bit different (well she had been just about everyone...I think DaVinci and Julius Caesar amongst others). Ruth died a couple of years ago, so in the highly unlikely event that she was correct, she could be coming to a vortex near you.	2004-02-25

Clearly Quantrill is a devoted fan of Leiviska, whom he sees as Finland's premier architect in the post Alvar Aalto age. Indeed, Leiviska followed Alvar Aalto and Reima Pietila in the great honor of becoming the architecture Member of the Academy of Finland in 1997.<br />This is a beautifully photographed and designed book combining commentary (by both Quantrill and Leiviska himself) on significant buildings in Leiviska's body of work with plans and interesting perspective photography of these beautiful structures. Among my favorite buildings illustrated here are the German Embassy in Helsinki, the Kouvola (Finland) Town Hall, and all his churches. The understated modernity of Leiviska's churches form a body of work without peer in Europe. Particularly breathtaking are the Parish Church and Centre for Myyrmaki, Vantaa, and the peerless Mannisto Church and Parish Centre.<br />Juha Leiviska is truly one of the all time greats of European architecture, and is one of the reasons that contemporary Finnish architecture has become the powerhouse that it is today. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in architecture or contemporary design. It is beautifully executed in every way, and I look forward to reading more from Malcolm Quantrill in the future.	2004-02-21

Unfortunately, his editing there, and here, is frequently ill-advised. He is not a pilot or flight crew member, or especially knowledgeable about aircraft operations, and it shows.<br />In &quot;On a Wing and a Prayer&quot;, he takes verbatim accounts (from the NTSB Survival Factors Group records) from survivors and witnesses and edits them into a somewhat coherent account of the accident from the perspective of the victims. Unfortunately, due to his lack of aviation background, he frequently does not know what is important and what isn't important to achieve an understanding of the accident, and, worse, frequently inserts 'clarifying' information in brackets into the survivor testimony that is sometimes completely wrong. It would have helped immensely if he had had a pilot and flight attendant review his manuscript for errors and editorial quirkiness. Don't misunderstand me; I don't think that Mr. MacPherson is a bad writer, per se (in fact, I think he is a sometimes brilliant writer, particularly noteworthy is his recent \\"The Cowboy and His Elephant\\"); I just think that in technical areas that he has virtually no comprehension or understanding of; it would be wise to have genuine experts review the manuscript for errors.<br />I think that this book is interesting to read, as so often the ordeal of the survivors is quickly forgotten after an accident, and it is frequently these perceptions and the information that survivors offer that are vital to improving future air safety.

Anyone with an interest in high drama at sea would be advised to pick up a copy of this book, but I particularly recommend it for people with an interest in safety engineering, environmental, or maritime safety.<br />The 'Torrey Canyon' was a 120,000 ton supertanker which went aground on some rocks off the southern coast of England on March 18, 1967. She released thousands of tons of oil into the sea, killing aquatic life and devastating seabirds all along the Cornish coast of Southern England, and along the Brittany coast of France. The oil on the beaches was at times up to 18 inches deep in some areas. Needless to say, it destroyed the tourist trade temporarily and took months to superficially clean up, while genuine deep cleaning took the ocean several years.<br />Mr. Petrow covers the accident from the beginning until about a year after the accident, when major cleanup was complete, but oil was still found under beaches by merely lifting up rocks or digging a few inches into the sand.<br />Ultimately Captain Pastrengo Rugiati was blamed for the accident by the Liberian appointed investigating board. ('Torrey Canyon' was registered in Liberia.) The proceedings of that board have never been made public, but through journalistic sources Petrow was able to obtain a copy, which comprised background for his investigation. The board appeared nothing more than a kangaroo court designed to help the shipping companies, on which Liberia owed a large part of its national income. There is no doubt that Captain Rugiati made errors on the bridge, most notably deciding to pass in a narrow channel between known rock formations in the Scilly Isles. From a perspective of accident investigation, that would seem to be the root cause of the accident, though there were other factors, including the presence of fishing boats hindering his turn away from the rocks, and a confusing control lever on the bridge to allow disengagement of the autopilot, so that the helmsman could manually steer the ship. In reviewing the book, it seems that while the board slammed Captain Rugiati for not checking the lever was in the &quot;hand&quot; position to allow manual steering, also culpable would be the professional helmsman, who realized the ship was not turning, and had the control lever right beside him, yet did not notice it's inappropriate setting or advise the Captain of it's status. There was poor crew communication, and the problems on the bridge were exacerbated by a series of bad navigational fixes taken by a new Third Officer who had just come on watch. Altogether, while a major portion on the blame must go to Captain Rugiati, there was culpability elsewhere, too.<br />The story of the clean up is as fascinating as the story of the actual wreck. England (and later France) used detergents with harsh, toxic solvents to clean rocks and beaches. While none of the sea life benefited from the presence of the oil, most fish and shellfish were able to live with minimal problems in the oily mess. The seabirds were the innocent creatures who took the brunt of the ecological devastation from the oil, and the chapter dealing with the bird rescue will rend the heart of anyone. The real devastation to marine life came from the detergents used, which, though they could superficially clean the beaches, they killed absolutely all marine life in their path, despite preposterous claims to the contrary by the detergent manufacturers. Modern marine biologists and ecologists would be well served by a reading of this book to assist in formulating better cleanup strategies for the future.<br />Mr. Petrow did a fine job of investigative reporting, and always told all sides of the story. His special research into the Liberian investigation, hispersonal interviews with Captain Rugiati, and his extensive analysis towards the conclusion of the book on the intricacies of maritime law are especially commendable, and show the thoroughness with which this book was prepared.

The map is a 1:600,000 scale map of the entire country, along with inset maps of Reykjavik and other areas of interest, such as Akureyri, Heimaey and The Skaftafell National Park.<br />Also included are several representative color photos from different areas, a very useful index, a climate guide, a trilingual legend (English, Icelandic, and German), and a distance table to see how far apart places of interest are. My only desire would be more detailed information on the inset Reykjavik map on locations of hotels, museums, etc. A few places are noted, but a separate inset of 'places of interest' would be a nice feature for future editions.<br />I highly recommend a trip to Iceland, and I heartily endorse this map as essential to helping you prepare for your visit. Be sure to pack it with you, as it will prove indispensable, and is generally less cumbersome than most maps found in guidebooks.	2004-02-14

I have loved their book &quot;Why Cats Paint&quot; for years, and had to buy &quot;Cat Artists and Their Work&quot;. What I didn't fully understand when I bought the book, is that this is actually a book of postcards that can be removed and mailed. The book is so beautiful, and the commentary on the art is so sublime that I couldn't bring myself to tear the cards out and thus destroy the book. So, I bought a second copy of the book because the postcards are absolutely wonderful, and are great for special notes to the cat lovers in your life.<br />I hope to see more work from Busch and Silver in the future, as they are able like few others to capture the intellect and simultaneous silliness of our feline friends in captivating photographs and wonderful, warm commentary.	2004-02-13

This large, colorful book is filled with beautifully composed photos of cats in the Greek Isles. Most of the photos are of one or two cats, though there are a few that have larger groups of cats.<br />The beauty of this book is in Sylvester's ability to convey feline temperament, mood, attitude, guile, poise, and grace in every frame. Most people who love cats admire their range of physical expressions of mood, from facial expressions to body language. Here Silvester captures all of the moods related to feline affection beautifully. The cats come across not so much as mere animals, but as loving, caring beings that have a wide range of emotions, which is of course one of many reasons that humans love cats so much.<br />Although it definitely is a part of feline affection, my only criticism of the book would be the inclusion of a couple of photographs of cats actually mating. I don't object to this out of prudishness, but that those photos tend to damage the mood of the rest of the book: going from love and sensuality to a more overt, biological look at the mechanics of feline reproduction, which is not what the book is really about. Fortunately there are only a couple of these examples, yet their presence is the sole reason that I didn't give this otherwise very worthy book five stars.<br />For a cat lover, or anyone who admires beautiful photography, this book would be hard to beat, and I highly recommend it.	2004-02-11

The book is clear and well illustrated (although a couple of the charts are a bit cumbersome and unwieldy), and calls upon numerous case studies to illustrate key points. There are separate chapters of Hazard Analysis, Fault Tree Analysis, Safety Analysis in Engineering, and Safety Management.<br />While useful for engineers (particularly in the chemical processing or nuclear fields), this book is written in comprehensible terms that do not require an engineering background or technical education to understand. In fact, I believe that the biggest beneficiaries of this book are not engineers at all, but non-technical managers, who desperately need to understand safety systems, but often don't. In fact the chapter on Safety Management should be required reading for any manager in a safety critical environment, as it is an excellent &quot;how to&quot; guide to safety management of complex systems. This chapter has examples of correct safety management, and more importantly, excellent examples of the perils of management unwillingness to prioritize safety. The case study of the Nypro UK cyclohexane plant explosion in Flixborough, England is the best detailed, and has universal applications to safety systems across varying industries. The loss of the shuttle 'Challenger' is also reviewed from a systems safety vantage point, but while there are many errors to be analyzed and learned from there, more of the lessons are industry specific than are the lessons from the Flixborough example.<br />I used this book in a graduate class on systems safety. This is one of the best safety books I have seen, and is the most concise text on systems safety that I have ever read, far better, for instance, than the works of Perrow. Mr. Bahr is to be commended for his work; I look forward to reading more by him in the future.	2004-02-01

While he is himself a professor of engineering, Petroski uses language comprehensible to the layman making this book accessible to almost anyone. During the course of the book he argues that engineering is part art and part science, and that as a discipline engineers focus on building safe, affordable, and reliable things (from paper clips to airliners) to meet a set of requirements. He goes on to elaborate that, being human, engineers make errors and sometimes spectacular failures ensue. The key, he argues, is that once errors are exposed, engineers can glean knowledge from those problems to improve future designs.<br />He uses accessible examples that most people can readily relate to, from researching failure modes on one of his son's toys (the components used most frequently failed first, just like a frequently used light bulb burns out more quickly due to metal fatigue and subsequent cracking), to the deadly collapse of the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Hotel walkways, which killed over 100 people. He also discusses easy to comprehend failures (suspension bridges in strong wind), and more intricate interactions, such as was revealed in the Chicago DC-10 accident. Throughout, he retains an aura of good humor and approachability, which makes this book far more readable than most books in this field.<br />My only complaint about the book is not even the fault of Mr. Petroski at all: the font in the book is very small, and combined with small borders, the book is a bit tough to physically read. Small matter, though, as once you start the book, you will not want to put it down. Well done.	2004-02-01

This book is an utter delight for anyone who cherishes the unusual, strange, or surreal. The book contains 162 poems (technically, many are not haiku, but are senryu, but since 'ku' means 'verse' in Japanese, the title is still appropriate) about the most popular spiced pork luncheon meat product the world has ever known.<br />The book is actually divided into chapters such as &quot;Dreams and Nightmares&quot;, Obsession and Addiction&quot;, and &quot;Philosophy and Deep Thought.&quot; In all cases Mr. Cho, who is the 'Spam Haiku Archive Master' (SPAM) for his Spam-ku website ([...] has selected only the tastiest poetic morsels for us to feast on. I have many favorites, but will cite two examples of the finest of the Spam poetry genre. In the section &quot;Epiphany and Portent&quot; there is this gem:<br />Roseate pork slab,<br />How you quiver on my spork!<br />Radiant light, gelled.<br />While in the section &quot;Anticipation and Desire&quot;, this little greasy gem lurks:<br />How my hands tremble<br />Applying a light coat of<br />SPAM-colored lipstick.<br />All in all this book is perfect for those with a well developed or offbeat sense of humor, or alternately, it is tailor made to annoy anyone who takes poetry way too seriously (which can be fun in and of itself).

This is a simply delightful little book about a cat who has a whole bevy of modern psychological issues, and finds relief in the miracles of Prozac, Xanax, Valium, Ambien, and a whole host of other medicinal delights! I was surprised to find that the only disorder this poor kitty didn't suffer from was Attention Deficit Disorder, but given his daily dosage of mood altering substances, I'm betting he'll feel just fine even if ADD is diagnosed in a sequel.<br />This is a very funny book, and is a quick read. The narrative is funny and crisp, the illustrations are wonderful, and the whole thing serves as a witty parable of the excesses of modern life, and the easy way out so often prescribed by so many Psychiatrists today.<br />I love this book!

I also have a science background, and thought this would be an interesting blend of the two. The book really isn't what I expected, but has some strong points.<br />Generally speaking, this is a physics textbook designed for the advanced high school level (the author was for years a teacher in the San Bernardino Secondary School District.) The book is divided into sections to enable the reader to make non calculus calculations of relevant equations for a generalized translunar flight. The math is relatively easy to follow, but I would complain that on many pages the equations get rather jumbled and require re-reading to get your bearings. There are also 'self test' sections at the end of each area to check your learning (answers in the back are provided.) The book begins with an overview of basic astronomy and physics, including a relevant math review (up through and including trigonometry), and concludes with a section on the Apollo 11 mission profile including generalized calculations and considerations. The physics sections are obviously very clear to the author, and are generally well written.<br />The downside here is the Apollo specific information, some of which is just plain incorrect. It appears that even though the author claims to be a huge admirer of the Apollo program and the astronauts, he just seems to have vaguely glanced at the introduction to a book on space flight, never bothering to become genuinely knowledgeable on the subject. On several occasions he states that Apollo 14 was the last Apollo mission, which, of course fails to account for the Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions. I honestly can't understand this most basic of errors, nor can I understand the errors in terminology and crew names (not to mention the famous &quot;One small step for man&quot; quote, which is botched here) that prevail throughout the book. He claims to have written this book after his retirement, but certain dates in this book make me wonder when it was actually written. He references the Challenger disaster and Mir, but other features make me suspect that this book was largely written some time ago, particularly the lack of knowledge of missions after Apollo 14, the computer section, and the quality of the illustrations. The illustrations must be singled out for a bit of critique. They obviously were done freehand, most likely by the author, and are very poor in quality. Commercially available clipart and inexpensive drawing programs render these obsolete, which makes me believe they were done prior to the modern PC. Further, there is an entire section on computers and the chosen language he wrote his programs in is BASIC, which makes me think that this must be fairly old. At best the computer information is useless.<br />To sum up, if you want a physics book about basic space flight, this is an OK choice; if you want a book about anything specifically related to Apollo you will be disappointed. I heartily recommend this book to one group without reservation, though: high school physics teachers. This is a book that will challenge and interest high school age students. The math is not entirely basic, but requires no calculus, and the format would be perfect for a one quarter long unit on space, introduced, of course by a decent documentary on the space race, like the NOVA DVD available here on Amazon.s book after his retirement, but certain dates in this book make me wonder when it was actually written.

On the one hand Perrow offers some genuine insight into systems safety, but frequently does not understand the technicalities of the systems (or occasionally their operators) well enough to make informed decisions and recommendations. In more egregious cases he comes to conclusions that are guaranteed to reduce safety (as when he argues that supertankers should be run by committee, and the usefulness of the Captain is no more) or are merely the cherished liberal opinions of an Ivy League sociologist (he teaches at Yale) as when he argues for unilateral nuclear disarmament, government guaranteed income plans, and heroin maintenance (distribution) plans for addicts &quot;to reduce crime.&quot; In the case of disarmament, remember this was written during the early 1980s while the Soviet Union was still a huge threat...complete nuclear disarmament would have resulted in fewer US nuclear accidents, but would NOT have made us safer as we would have been totally vulnerable to intentional nuclear attack. He has great personal animosity toward Ronald Reagan, and makes inflammatory statements in the mining section that mining safety regulations would surely be weakened by Reagan, causing many more accidents and deaths. Later in the same section, though, he concludes that mining is inherently dangerous, and no amount of regulation can make it safe. So which is it? Any of this is, at very best, folly, but regardless of political bent (he is a self avowed &quot;leftist liberal&quot;) has absolutely no place in a book ostensibly on safety systems. As such I think portions of this book show what is so wrong in American academia today: even genuinely excellent research can be easily spoiled when the conclusions are known before the research is started. This is one of the many reasons that physical scientists scorn the social sciences, and it doesn't have to be this way.<br />Having said all that there IS a wealth of good information and insight in this book when Perrow sticks to systems and their interactions. The book contains the finest analysis commercially available of the Three Mile Island near-disaster, and his insight about how to improve safety in nuclear plants was timely when the book was written in 1984, though many improvements have been made since then.<br />Speaking as a commercial airline pilot, I feel his conclusions and observations about aircraft safety were generally true at the time of printing in 1984, but now are miserably out of date. (The same is true of the Air Traffic Control section.) I believe that he generally has a good layman's grasp of aviation, so I am willing to take it as a given that he has a knowledgeable layman's comprehension of the other systems discussed. As an aside, he never gets some of the technicalities quite right. For instance, he constantly uses the term 'coupling' incorrectly in the engineering sense; this is particularly objectionable in the aviation system where it has a very specific meaning to aeronautical engineers and pilots.<br />The section on maritime accidents and safety is superbly written. Here I am not an expert, but there seems to be a high degree of correlation with the aviation section. His section on &quot;Non Collision Course Collisions&quot; by itself makes this book a worthwhile read. He presents very compelling information and reasoning until the very end of the section, at which point he suggests that since ships are now so big, large ships (especially supertankers) essentially should have no Captain, but should be run by committee. This is an invalid conclusion, and he offers no evidence or substantial argument to support that idea. Clearly, it is an idea hatched in his office and not on a ship (or plane.) There always needs to be a person in a place of ultimate authority in fast moving, dynamic systems, or the potential exists to have crew members beginto work at direct odds with each other, making a marginal situation dangerous. Ironically, in the very same part of the discussion where he concludes that there should be no Captain, he has hit upon the key to the problem. He mentions that he was pleased to see that some European shippers were now training their crews together as a team, and that he expected this to lower accident rates. He is, in fact, exactly right about that. Airlines now have to train crews in Crew Resource Management (CRM) in which each member of the crew has the right and obligation to speak up if they notice anything awry in the operation of their aircraft, and the Captain makes it a priority to listen to the input of others, as everyone has a different set of concerns and knowledge. In this way, the Captain becomes much less dictatorial, and becomes more of a final decision maker after everyone has had their say. It IS critical, though, to maintain someone in command, as there is no time to assemble a staff meeting when a ship is about to run aground, or a mid-air collision is about to occur. Many other well documented studies and books have come to this conclusion, and in the airline industry since CRM was introduced the accident rate has decreased dramatically.<br />Overall, if you have a desire to understand high risk systems, this book has a lot of good information in it; however it is woefully out of date and for that reason among others, I can only recommend it with reservations. A better and much more contemporary introductory book on the subject is 'Inviting Disaster' by James R. Chiles. Remember, this book was written over twenty years ago, and much has changed since then.

Karen Anderson has a knack for explaining cat behavior in a sweet and enjoyable way that is not only lyrical but effective. Part of the fun of being around cats is trying to figure out the sublime and strange ways that they express emotions like affection, love, curiosity and anger. In this book the author demonstrates her lasting respect and love for these amazing and beautiful creatures. As all cat lovers know, cats do peculiar things that are often difficult for us humans to understand. In this book Karen Anderson succeeds at answering questions from basic fare such as &quot;Why do cats sleep all day?&quot;, to more involved questions like &quot;Why do cats cover up their half eaten food?&quot; The answers are sometimes amazing, and will make anyone cherish the quirkiness of their feline companions even more.<br />Any review of this book without praise for Wendy Christensen's beautiful and plentiful illustrations would be remiss. She is a gifted feline illustrator, and the text is immeasurably enhanced by the presence of her drawings.<br />In the end, the last question in the book is also my favorite: &quot;Why do cats completely endear themselves to us?&quot; Although she does explore answers to this question, I like to think that every cat has their own personality and their own set of beguiling charms so unique, that any answer to that question can never totally do justice to our feline friends.<br />Bravo, and thank you, Karen and Wendy!	2004-01-29

Pollak rode on the 'Colombo Bay', a modern containerized freighter owned by P&amp;O Nedlloyd, the second biggest shipping concern in the world for a five week voyage halfway around the world. Starting the day after the 9/11 attacks in Hong Kong, and eventually traveling the long way around the world back to his home in New York, Pollak tells readers of the drudgery and excitement that go hand in hand on one of these mammoth vessels.<br />During the course of the voyage he talks with all crew members (as well as with many other characters of all types he meets in port) and relates not only what they say, but what their real points of view are, generally attempting  to tell a story from both sides. He not only describes who the sailors are, but their backgrounds and aspirations. He makes the point repeatedly, for instance, that Filipino sailors are prized by shipping companies for three fundamental reasons: they are good workers; they have good attitudes; and they work cheap. He then goes on to deliver the rest of the story from the Filipino sailors point of view, that though they may be making less than someone from the US or Europe would be making doing the same job, they are happy to have the job, as jobs in the Philippines are very scarce and they make more than ten times the average earnings of land based Filipinos. This same type of 'both sides of the story' journalism penetrates the vast majority (with exceptions) of the commentary in the book.<br />Pollak not only discusses the men but the machines involved, and gives us the basic history of containerized cargo. This may not sound very exciting, but it actually is quite interesting to anyone with a view for history and world balance of trade and power. After World War Two, the US led the world in cargo shipping, and now controls almost none. In fact the twenty largest carriers are now headquartered outside the US (even the United States Lines was sold to an Asian investor a few years ago.) The net result of this revolution in containerization has led to much more efficient shipping as well as a huge increase in imports to the US; after all the US has been a net importer since 1976, and now has a roughly $500 Billion trade deficit. Even politicians are beginning to see that this is a significant problem as the US has had a net outflow of jobs to the cheaper countries of the world, taking US dollars with them. Pollak tells this story generally quite well, though his personal biases begin to creep into the discussions. He can't seem to make up his mind if he is protectionist of US jobs (he is a self described liberal), or if he is a free trader (after he sees how much the jobs mean to the third world.) I am sure he isn't the only one with these quandaries, but the net effect here is one of a brilliant opening and discussion of the geopolitics of containerized shipping, with a muddled conclusion drawn from it.<br />He also discusses other threats to shipping, including piracy (a bigger deal than you probably realize), stowaways (shipping companies and crews can't win no matter what they do), fires (the biggest threat to a ship), and weather (still a huge factor in maritime accidents.)<br />My biggest problem in the book is when he digresses from discussing issues relevant to shipping. For instance he has a long discussion about how awful it is that the US is only sixth in the world in foreign aid on a per GDP basis, ignoring the facts that the US is by far first in the world overall (the other countries have vastly smaller economies), and he does not include the overwhelming first place expenses of military and peacekeeping operations worldwide (many of which (for instance, Somalia) came about during the more to his liking Clinton administration) that the US has. He also takes an opportunity to make personal statements about how inhumane it is that the US converted containers into shelters in Guantanamo Bay for Taliban detainees, and alleges with no evidence given that US troops were part of a massacre of Taliban prisoners in the spring of 2002, despite a rigorous investigation that found otherwise. This was brought into the book on the tangential basis that it is relevant because the prisoners were transported in containers. This is his book, and he can put anything he wants to in it, no matter how irrelevant it is. I recognize that as his right, but that is the sole reason that I downgraded this book to four stars. On the plus side, he does discuss the potential for container ships to be used as weapons by terrorists, and generally presents a good introduction to that subject (although even here he decries the prohibition of crewmen being able to leave the ship in the US without background checks, all the while talking about how awful 9/11 was.)<br />Overall, I think 'Colombo Bay' is a masterwork: it is taut, detailed, and human.

This is a great little book, and really tells you what you need to know before a stay in Reykjavik. It is a small book, and fits into most any pocket. It is divided into useful sections like 'Sleeping' (hotels, guesthouses, etc.), 'Festivals and Events' (from Independence Day to the Icelandic Jazz Festival), and many other handy sections.<br />It focuses on things that are fun, historical, and/or quirky. For instance, there is an interesting and helpful commentary on Pingvellir National Park, home of the world's first elected parliament and general assembly (930 AD), and the huge geysers (&quot;Geysir&quot; and &quot;Strokkur&quot;, which are, in fact, very impressive.) If you are into art there are numerous small and large art galleries and museums around Reykjavik, and this book details all the ones you might want to see (my favorite is the ASI Art Museum ([...] if you are interested), and the much stranger (and vastly creepier, yet less funny than expected) Iceland Phallogical Museum which is stuck away on Laugavegur, a key street in the main city shopping and arts district. It is just too weird to believe, but while you're there, you really owe it to yourself to visit, preferably not immediately after eating a large Mexican lunch, like I did (trust me on this one.) If you are into nightclubs, there are reviews of all of the happening places in Reykjavik, such as Club NASA. All types of transportation and lodging options (from the beautiful grand 'Hotel Borg', where I most recently stayed, to the Salvation Army Hostel accommodations for sleeping bags) are presented, and will definitely assist you in finding a place to stay that is in your budget and to your tastes.<br />The point of all this is simple: if you are going to visit Reykjavik, especially for the first time, you need this book. It has information that will be useful to absolutely anyone, as well as commonly called numbers, and several small but useful maps. As an aside, order it when it is in stock, it sometimes is unavailable for long periods, so grab it while you can. Don't go to Reykjavik without it.sometimes is unavailable for long periods, so grab it while you can. Don't go to Reykjavik without it.	2004-01-19

I like this London guide because it is a nice size (easy to carry) and is full of genuinely useful information.<br />I particularly like the very detailed maps in the back of the book (there are 16 color maps in addition to the tube map and a few other handy things back there). The maps make planning itineraries much easier than if they are spread throughout the book. One minor quibble about the maps, though: the maps are of excellent detail, but cover relatively small geographic areas. That's ideal for detail, except for the fact that there is very little orienting information about how the various maps fit together. It's not a huge deal, but is the only real room for improvement that I saw in the book.<br />As far as information goes, the hotel and restaurant stuff is pretty standard fare, but the information on sights and attractions is wonderful. I am especially fond of the &quot;Highlights and Lowlights&quot; sections which point out the things generally of highest import to a tourist. Of course, there is substantial information on other things, but this 'do not miss' feature is great. I was also especially pleased with the detailed public transport information including the tube, trains, taxis, buses, and all five airports (and how to get to and from them.)<br />In short, I am really impressed with this latest edition of the Lonely Planet London book, and will definitely be packing it when I go to England next.	2004-01-19

Evidently some of the tube information is a bit out of date, but aside from that minor quibble, it is a very sturdy and utilitarian map. I like that it is an accordion fold laminated card format, as it is eminently durable and near waterproof. It would be very difficult to damage.<br />It is particularly good to gain a 'lay of the land', particularly in the planning stages of a trip. It is quite easy to visualize where you will want to stay, visit, walk and ride. I like that it has a nice 'London walking tour' outlined, and has all prominent landmarks and points of interest clearly labeled. There is also an excellent and complete index, map of West End theatres, an inset map of inner London, and an underground map.<br />Overall, for initial trip and route planning as well as navigating London's sights, this is an excellent map at a bargain price!	2004-01-14

I have kept up with the 'Annals of Improbable Research' for several years, and must say that this book reflects the best of the highbrow, yet offbeat sense of humor found in 'AIR'.<br />For those unfamiliar, the Ig Nobel prizes are awarded every year for &quot;achievements that cannot or should not be reproduced&quot; in an elaborate spectacle of a ceremony at Harvard University. Among the participants are many genuine Nobel Prize winners, proving beyond doubt that scientists do have a sense of humor.<br />There is something for everyone in this book, even for those who hate science; in fact especially for those who hate science. The subjects coast gracefully from the bizarre (&quot;Elevator Music Prevents the Common Cold&quot;) to the absolute fringe of science (&quot;The Effects of Ale, Garlic, and Soured Cream on the Appetites of Leeches&quot;; the sour cream was the biggest appetite stimulant, by the way). There are subjects you would have never thought of (unless you are a scientist with way too much time and Federal grant money on your hands) from levitating frogs to &quot;Chicken Plucking as Measure of Tornado Wind Speed&quot;. The subject matter is dizzying and amusing.<br />I eventually settled on a four star rating for a couple of reasons. First, in a majority of cases, these studies are supported through tax dollars, and I generally resent the glorification of wasted money, which this book surely is in great, if unintentional, part (only a small percentage of these studies have genuine follow on benefits; most were clearly done for square-filling publication in the 'publish or perish' world of academia). Second, the politically motivated selection of some recipients, notably Edward Teller, is an undeserved slap at scientists who did and do work on defense projects (where a huge number of genuine scientific advances actually occur) by what is an obviously smug class of academics, who clearly seek to advance their own political agenda. I find that to have tarnished what would have otherwise been a superior work of science reporting and humor.<br />Despite my reservations, I overall recommend the book, as it does generally meet its stated goals of making a person laugh and think.e tarnished what would have otherwise been a superior work of science reporting and humor. <br />Despite my reservations, I overall recommend the book, as it does generally meet its stated goals of making a person laugh and think.	2004-01-07

D. is in, but I would guess psychology given the human factors emphasis evident in this book. Indeed, human factors play an overriding factor in many if not most accidents and she gives good and bad examples of Cockpit Resource Management (CRM) and Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM) in the numerous case studies in this book.<br />The book is designed in broad categories of accident types (for example, 'Weather' and 'Mid-Air Collisions'), which are further broken down by specific hazard type ('Thunderstorms' and 'Turbulence', for instance) and illustrated with case studies largely taken from NTSB reports. Most of the case studies are excellent, and her analysis is generally quite good, although her specific systems knowledge is occasionally not up to speed (for instance, in the L-1011 autoflight discussion of EAL 401, and in the hydraulic system discussion in the 737 rudder hardover accidents). The minor systems errors and misconceptions found in these sections would be virtually undetectable to someone who had not flown the specific aircraft in question, and at any rate are mere annoyances at worst. The overall level of analysis is good enough that trivial details don't take away from the greater points she makes.<br />Overall, the book is a quite comprehensive text and should be read by pilots and aviation personnel of all experience levels. Her discussions of weather accidents and runway incursions were superlative. Particularly well covered were icing and microburst accidents, though I think she went a little far in her discussion of 'giant anteater clouds'.<br />Distractions for me were what I thought were a relatively large number of typographical errors, including the very annoying, often repeated (likely spell check induced) &quot;HIS&quot; instead of &quot;HSI&quot;. The systems quibbles were minor as well, but nonetheless a distraction in some instances. The effort to make the book 'current' by including the Air France Concorde accident was a mistake. The summary presented was evidently taken from a sole internet source and completely devoid of useful information.<br />On balance, I think this is an excellent effort, and should be read by all pilots, the earlier in their career, the better.ce Concorde accident was a mistake.

US	52988732	RYKMWEVXV6A7G	0471469130	467641260	Armey's Axioms:  40 Hard-Earned Truths from Politics, Faith, and Life	Books	4	6	7	N	Y	The Idea is Bigger Than the Man	Overall I found this book by Dick Armey to be interesting, well thought out, and introspective, despite a couple of faults. I will deal with the strengths first, and the faults second.<br />The book is easy to read, and contains a lot of good analysis. Particularly pleasing is the extensive analysis, comparison, and contrast between liberals and conservatives. This is particularly well developed in Axioms 21 and 23, 'Liberals love feelings too much', and 'Conservatives believe it when they see it, Liberals believe it when they believe it'. His arguments are cogent and fact based, and he does not resort to name calling at any point. To a fault, he is respectful of his opposition, to the point of praising noted liberal reporter David Broder of the 'Washington Post' for honest journalism and high standards.<br />I respect that that Armey is up front and comfortable in his religion. He gives the credit for his success to God from the outset, which I respect. I believe that given his personal convictions, that he presents his religious views well, and is a credit to himself and his church (I believe that he is a Presbyterian, by the way).<br />The book generally stays away from bashing opponents by name (except for Charlie Rangel, who Armey must really dislike) which I believe is generally good policy, but he takes it to the point of annoyance. He frequently refers to 'a member of the opposing party', or something similar, which I presume is out of courtesy, but often makes the book more difficult to follow in specific matters. I appreciate candor, and if a story needs background, I would appreciate naming names so as to better judge the wisdom being imparted. My second irritant is the claimed enormous 'success' of his cherished military base closing legislation (BRAC) that he pushed in his first term in congress. I do not endorse the necessity of military service for congressional or other political service (in fact, I am annoyed with the hypocrisy of those that slam Dick Armey for not having been in the military, but say that is was unimportant that Bill Clinton had not served) but I do think that to write legislation as significant as BRAC, it would have been appropriate to have either served in the military, or extensively called on others that had in developing the bill. The closing of \\"redundant and wasteful military bases\\" is presented in terms of a great money saving idea designed to make government smaller. In reality BRAC has proved not quite as apolitical as Armey claims, and may, in the long run, harm our defense posture in part. In fact, the horse trading done in Washington over which bases to close has never gone away, and genuinely horrible decisions (like closing Williams AFB in AZ, the biggest, most productive pilot training base with the highest number of good weather flying days annually, while keeping open Columbus AFB, MS and Vance AFB, OK which have vastly less productivity) have frequently been the hallmarks of BRAC. Do not misunderstand my point: there was excess military base capacity. It is simply not clear (or in fact true) that the most suitable bases were the ones always abandoned.<br />All in all this is a well conceived book with a lot of important lessons between its covers. He is not, nor does he try to be politically correct, which is refreshing for a politician today. He is proud of his conservatism and takes the blows aimed at him as badges of honor, as perhaps best summed up in this quote: \\"The first rule of conservatism is that if you are true to yourself, Susan Sarandon will never hug you in public.\\" No doubt in his case, that is quite true. I started the book with mixed feelings about Dick Armey, and despite the flaws mentioned above, I finished it with much greater respect for him and his ideas.Dick Armey for not having been in the military, but say that is was unimportant that Bill Clinton had not served) but I do think that to write legislation as significant as BRAC, it would have been appropriate to have either served in the military, or extensively called on others that had in developing the bill.

I agree with him more often than not, but some of the cruises are a bit esoteric and definitely out of the mainstream (particularly the China information), which is fine as long as you understand that is what you are getting here. Many fine itineraries are reviewed here with information on passenger demographics, activities, and cost presented in fine fashion.<br />My biggest quibbles with the book's format is the lack of maps illustrating the geography of the trip to help get a better handle on where the itineraries actually go, and the lack of an easy to use cost index, which is a factor for many of us considering the astronomical costs of many of these cruises. As always, personal taste often dictates an individual's opinion of certain cruises. For instance, I prefer Celebrity's &quot;Horizon&quot; over their &quot;Zenith,&quot; (which Mr. Scull prefers) for a Bermuda cruise.<br />This is a fine book overall, if somewhat of a 'dream book.' It is excellent for generating ideas for new destinations and ships, and fills it's niche very well. If you are looking for more comprehensive cruise information, I would recommend &quot;Berlitz Ocean Cruising and Cruise Ships 2003&quot; by Douglas Ward as probably the single best cruise reference available, as it is amazingly complete.	2003-12-28

Including the very short \\"VD\\", \\"Jake's Journey\\", a pilot for an American sitcom written immediately prior to Graham's death, the odd conceptual piece \\"The Concrete Inspector\\", and the hilarious highlight of the book written in collaboration with the equally offbeat Douglas Adams, \\"Our Show For Ringo Starr\\", which was a avant-garde script for an hour long TV show promoting Ringo's then current album \\"Goodnight Vienna\\". (The best line is when Ringo gets to say: \\"The concept of a four-dimensional space-time continuum inevitably suggests that the universe looks like a prawn omelette.\\") I found \\"Jake's Journey\\" a bit tedious and formulaic, and the Ringo piece utterly brilliant, with everything else falling somewhere in between. Also of great use to the collector is a 'Chapmanography' of videos, recordings and books in which Graham somehow contributed.<br />This book is a very quick read, and I recommend it to people interested in Graham or Monty Python, just realize that it really isn't a biographical work as much as a set of quirky skits.	2003-12-24

This book made it easy to learn the exact steps involved along the way to making every dish contained herein.

In that regard, it is quite good: it does shed light on the lives of the three astronauts pre Apollo 11, and is particularly good in discussing background information on childhood, early flying careers, etc. It is particularly useful in relating information on Neil Armstrong, perhaps the most enigmatic of all the Apollo astronauts. That is the main strength of the book: it is a human interest story right out of 'Life' lengthened to 400 plus pages.<br />On the downside, the book tends to idealize the astronauts and NASA into supermen, and acts as if they have no faults.

It is written for laymen, yet does not condescend to people without a background in submarine operations. The K-141 'Kursk' sank on August 12, 2000 off northern Russia during a training exercise after an aged torpedo exploded in the bow of the boat, sinking the ship rapidly to the 350 foot deep seabed. 28 men survived in the aft of the ship and lived in a cold and dark environment for several days before being killed by a rapid flash fire.<br />The elements that led to the tragedy are compelling. The Russian navy was (and is) in utter disrepair after the breakup of the USSR, and rescue submersibles were among the first budget cuts made. Only several days after the 'Kursk' sank was help from England and Norway solicited, due largely to national pride (and fear of espionage). The entire debacle happened only a few months into the Putin administration and proved to be a watershed in Russian politics.<br />Moore tells the story from the viewpoint of the survivors, the would-be rescuers and the victim's families, with special emphasis on deteriorating Russian capabilities (and the preventable nature of the disaster) and the political forces that doomed the survivors to a sure death. Overall it is a superb telling of the salient points of the tragedy, its investigation, and aftermath. The photographs alone are worth the price of the book, particularly the pictures of 'Kursk' in drydock after the accident. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a general treatment of the technical side of the disaster and an in-depth covering of the political machinations involved.	2003-12-18

The bottom line, I actually expected that a book titled &quot;Last of the Green-Toed Fruit-Bats&quot; would actually be about fruit bats. That is, in fact, where I made my major error. It turns out that this book is actually a coming of age novel about a witch named Nelly Harbucker in the fictional land of 'New Balkland'. The fruit bats in question are mentioned, but do not really play a key part in the book.<br />The book is basically an anti-nuclear rant of the evils of mankind in general and males specifically. Pretty much without exception men are all evil or stupid in this book, with the exception of Daryl, the fruit bat keeper, who is merely shy. After his death, Nelly supposes that had she known Daryl better he would have been fairly awful too. I won't go into details here, but Nelly the burgeoning witch has a particular fondness for the library sciences, so we learn of her journey to becoming a full fledged witch/librarian. We also learn that it's OK for witches to take illicit advantage (rape) mentally handicapped men as a coven activity provided that it's all for a good cause.  In the end the nuclear powers of the world destroy the entire earth except New Balkland which was saved only by the witchy women knitting a magic net and encircling their island with it. Go figure. A UN submarine arrives finally to tell them how incredibly wise they all are and it contains the only other survivors on earth; thanks to the fact the Captain was also a witch. This is fairly realistic for the UN, I think.<br />I gave it two stars, as Toni Jeffreys did make a valiant attempt with very lame material, and there were some fairly isolated amusing passages in the book. Oddly enough, my copy came autographed by the author, but it still isn't worth much.thor, but it still isn't worth much.	2003-12-18

Contemporary architecture is often misunderstood and misrepresented by focusing on the extreme or most useless of structures. In this book Ojeda takes us into some of the most beautiful, yet utilitarian, contemporary homes from the Arizona desert to Manhattan. He explains the design choices made and more importantly why they were made for the different designs. Included in the book are numerous beautiful photos of the different projects and architectural sketches of the projects.<br />This book would be a wonderful 'idea book' for an architect, or someone like me who is looking for ideas to give to an architect in preparation for building a new house. It is also a simply beautiful book to look at and learn from, both in design concepts specifically, and in building materials as well. I highly endorse this book as one of the best illustrated generalist books available on contemporary architecture. The ideas you will get for your own home alone are worth the cost.	2003-12-10

This book is essentially the personal observations and reflections from within the Gemini and (mostly) Apollo programs, and as an external bystander from the early days of the Shuttle until now. What I like about the book is Cunningham's candor, a trait he was always know for within the program, and willingness to discuss the less glamorous, and less appreciated aspects of an astronaut's life in the 1960s.<br />Generally this type of book is fairly sanitized, and results in a glossy, picture perfect view of the Apollo program and its participants. Here Cunningham tells the story without pulling any punches. He attempts to give everyone their due, but in the end if he has negative information to convey he doesn't shirk from it. Others may disagree with his opinions (I do in a few instances: for example, I think he is unduly hard on Armstrong and Scott for their handling of their Gemini thruster problem), but he makes it clear at the outset that these are his views, and not the official party line. Many come out better than their average perceptions in the public (mostly because so many of these names are now generally forgotten), guys like Bill Anders and Rusty Schweickart, who really did some of the early pioneering that allowed the Apollo 11 and subsequent successes. Certainly the depiction of Conrad and Bean is very sympathetic, and reinforces their good guy personas with more detail devoted to their contributions than they normally get. Many come out worse, in some cases much, much worse. Many (but not all) of the Mercury 7 come across as self important, pompous windbags. I was particularly annoyed by Wally Schirra during the Apollo 7 mission. I had actually believed the position that Cunningham takes, namely that he and Eisele were trying largely to be team players while Wally was the one with the \\"Bull Moose Complex\\" (Cunningham's words) and temper that made the mission so agonizing for everyone, especially the ground controllers. Certainly Chris Kraft comes out as a very competent, but egotistical manager, and it still seems unfair that especially Cunningham's career was cut short largely through Kraft's efforts when he was really being painted with the same brush as Wally. (Donn Eisele also got a bit testy with the controllers, but Cunningham always showed restraint and deference. That has been established in numerous sources other than his own book.)<br />Cunningham does not pretend to be perfect, and admits to shortcomings, while giving credit where it is due. He makes no bones about it, for instance, that he thinks Armstrong and Scott mishandled the Gemini thruster situation, by jumping to quickly to an emergency measure that scrubbed the remainder of the mission too quickly (I disagree), but also goes on to say that nobody could have flown the Apollo 11 landing better than Armstrong (I agree). Likewise he says that Scott's Apollo 15 landing was the best scientific exploration of the moon in the entire series. This dichotomy explains in a nutshell why I liked the book: Cunningham is unafraid to critique a performance, yet will turn around and give the same person kudos for other events. In other words, he recognizes and addresses the fundamental truth that each human has individual strengths and weaknesses.<br />Particularly illuminating are his views on post-Apollo NASA, a giant bureaucracy that is slow to do anything and serves more as a political rather than a technical organization, especially under Dan Goldin in the Clinton years. The International Space Station, vis-a-vis Russian participation, particularly, is held up for scrutiny as the debacle it has become. Also discussed are institutional safety problems in the agency that led to the Challenger and Columbia accidents (Did we learn nothing from Apollo 1?), and the political appointment of astronauts based on politically correct social theories rather than professional competence.<br />In summary, this book, along with \\"Carrying the Fire\\" are the two books by Apollo astronauts that actually show insight into the program from the inside. Read them both, they will greatly expand your understanding of what made Apollo great.olitically correct social theories rather than professional competence.   <br />In summary, this book, along with \\"Carrying the Fire\\" are the two books by Apollo astronauts that actually show insight into the program from the inside.

In this volume there are several wonderful articles such as \\"Preserving the Grand Canyon: Final Report\\" in which the author proposes filling the Grand Canyon with Styrofoam peanuts of various types, and \\"A Decade of Burnt Food\\" by the founder and curator of the Museum of Burnt Food. Unfortunately, the real gems here are relatively few and far between, and occasion the articles get into heavy-handed political criticism, especially in the Ig Nobel Prizes section, which I found to be inappropriate, irrelevant to science generally, and a put off.<br />Fundamentally, \\"The Best of Annals of Improbable Research\\", with many of the same cast of characters is a by far funnier (and genuinely science driven) book than this one, so for my money, between the two, I would go for \\"The Best of Annals of Improbable Research\\" without hesitation. The primary difference between the two is a matter of degree: both show science at its most ludicrous, and both use bizarrely convoluted 'experiments' (actual or imagined) and brazen misinterpretations to make for amusing pseudo-scientific reading. \\"The Best of Annals of Improbable Research\\", though, is much more rigorously scientifically based, whereas most of \\"Sex as a Heap of Malfunctioning Rubble\\" is mostly simple fiction in scientific garb. Yes, it is still funny, but given the wealth of articles published over the years in 'The Journal of Irreproducible Results' it could have been much, much funnier. I would recommend a subscription to the 'Annals of Improbable Research' magazine or a copy of \\"The Best of Annals of Improbable Research\\" instead of this book. Normally I think both AIR and JIR are too short, and I can't get enough. With \\"Sex as a Heap of Malfunctioning Rubble\\", I just wanted to get the book over with.	2003-12-01

I got that, so in that sense, I am satisfied. My goal is a quality, part-time, part-residency MBA. The hardest part of researching these programs is finding out which schools offer them. In that sense this is a good book as it lists those schools in a much more concise format that does a comprehensive guide like Peterson's MBA Programs, which also includes traditional, full time degrees.<br />I do know that Dr. Bear has been disparaged for being affiliated with several diploma mills in the past, and is frequently savaged in reviews and on the internet. I do not know or claim to know of all of Dr. Bear's current and former dealings, but if you use this book simply as a listing and starting point for further research, it could be a useful resource.  I would always do due diligence on my own, finding out detailed program and accreditation information before considering a school or program further. My recommendation for others interested in graduate degrees would be to consult with a Peterson's guide, like I have, as the single best source of information in book form.<br />There are certainly a lot of well known and reputable schools in the Bear's Guide, but there are others I have never heard of. Like anything else, buyer beware: do the research on your own.	2003-12-01

Many of the one star reviewers have little specific criticism and have resorted to name calling as a substitute for introspection and analysis. One infers that in a previous age she would have been in the Klan (she's Jewish) or simply calls her an 'idiot' as an apparent substitute for discourse. She actually went to Columbia University, a fairly liberal school. Should I therefore call all Columbia grads idiots? No; that would be unfair, just like it is unfair to call her names simply because you disagree with her. There ARE idiots on the Left (and Right), but Mona Charen certainly doesn't make the list.<br />Aside from a couple of misspelled names (and a one time reference to a column by Thomas Friedman which makes him look a bit more left than I believe he really is), this book is an excruciatingly documented work, in which Charen uses quotes, combined with historical background information to let the 'idiots' speak for themselves. Several reviewers have gone on about all the liberal cold warriors like JFK, LBJ, and Harry Truman. And then their list pretty much stops. In actuality, Charen gives them their due credit along with others such and Sen. Henry \\"Scoop\\" Jackson in being tough (even with Johnson's botched execution) on Communism and strong on defense. This book is not anti-Democrat, it is anti-liberal policy. The obvious problem is that since the Democratic party has diverged so far to the left over the last thirty years (a phenomenon noted even by the outstanding Democratic Senator Zell Miller) that a cry against liberal policies will almost necessitate an indictment of the democratic proponents of those policies. Charen is very quick to give credit to anti-communist Democrats, as well as criticize left leaning Republicans, such as Elliott Richardson.<br />Part of the problem with the low rated reviews of this book (besides the name calling, and my conviction that most of them have not actually read the book) is the fanciful self-delusion that the left propagates about how they (generally the Democrats) were just as hard line anti-communist as the Republicans, that, in fact it was a joint effort to defeat Communism. Charen spends a lot of time on this subject, and it is one of the keys to the book. She debunks that myth with countless citations and quotations, all meticulously researched. For instance, the section on Andrew Young, Jimmy Carter's Ambassador to the UN (and now, embarrassingly, on the Board of Directors of my company), who went on record as saying that the US is a leading agent of repression in the world, but then excuses Soviet human rights barbarism (millions slaughtered, tortured, and imprisoned) by saying, among other things, this: \\"We must recognize that they are growing up in circumstances different than ours. They have, therefore, developed a completely different concept of human rights. For them human rights are essentially not civil and political, but economic.\\" This type of obvious pandering to the Soviets and apologizing for their every misdeed is clear not only in Young, but throughout the Johnson, Carter, and Clinton administrations with people like Robert McNamara (ultimate pie in the sky, liberal wonk, and conceiver of the disastrous policy of 'gradualism' in Vietnam), McGeorge Bundy, and Cyrus Vance having real power to direct American foreign (and domestic) policy, with disastrous results.<br />The self loathing in the left did not stop in the Presidential administrations, of course. Numerous Congressmen and Senators are profiled, with Chris Dodd and Ron Dellums getting their fair share of criticism. In the 1980's Dodd was one of the biggest detractors of Reagan's Central America policy as destabilizing and threatening to our national security far more than the presence of an active Communist hotspot in the continental Americas. He of course was speaking of El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Grenada. At the time the left railed on the Reagan administration for their opposition to Communism in each of those countries, always using the same ruse, of at first denying that the opposition actually were Communists (normally they would say 'leftists'), then progressing to the line that the country was small an impoverished (just like Cuba was in 1962, when a real Democratic cold warrior had to face down the Soviets in a missile crisis), and finally, that we can't win a guerilla war, just look at Vietnam. Of course, Dodd is not the only example; Ron Dellums is an even more spectacular buffoon. Dellums absolutely foamed with adoration for Communists in Latin America. Dellums was particularly enamored with Communist Maurice Bishop who seized power in Grenada (before he himself was killed by competing Communists). In a correspondence with Bishop, Dellums aide Carlottia Scott wrote this: \\"Ron as a political thinker is the best around and Fidel [Castro] will verify that in no uncertain terms...Ron had a long talk with Barb and me when we got to Havana and cried when he realized that we had been shouldering Grenada all alone at this time. Like I said, he's really hooked on you and Grenada and doesn't want anything to happen to building the revo [sic] and making it strong. He really admires you as a person, and even more so as a leader with courage and foresight, principle and integrity...the only other person that I know of that he expresses such admiration for is Fidel.\\" Of course 'Barb' is Barbara Lee, now in congress, and the only one to vote against authorizing military force to combat the aftermath of the September 11th attacks.<br />Fortunately, Dodd, Dellums and the rest are now discredited by history: El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Grenada are now all democracies. So the question remains: Why should we now listen to Dodd (and his compatriots) on Iraq?

This book is an interesting one as it is seen through the eyes of a Major (an experienced, mid-level officer) as opposed to Jack Broughton's classics 'Thud Ridge' and 'Going Downtown', which are written from the higher level viewpoint, and the new classic 'When Thunder Rolled', by Ed Rasimus, who went to the Thud (and Vietnam) as a Lieutenant right out of Pilot Training. As such, Bell's '100 Missions North' is right in the middle. If you have the time I would read all three authors, as in combination, you can get the best composite viewpoint.<br />Bell's writing is strongest in describing everyday events and life in the squadron hooches. I think there is more tactics and flying specific information in the Broughton and Rasimus books (which I love), but Bell is able to make anyone (even someone not familiar with the military, the F-105, or Vietnam) feel like they are right there.<br />This book should be on the bookshelf of everyone with an interest in military aviation, especially if you happen to love the F-105.	2003-11-28

There is a colorful if brief history of all three bands, and a short introduction by Guest. Additionally, there are printed and complete versions of all the lyrics printed both within the sheet music and outside of it, where they are easier to read. A special bonus is the music to 'The Catheter Song,' which was scandalously omitted from the soundtrack.<br />If you like the movie, or just like the music, you will like this book, just understand it's a music book first, and a scrapbook second.	2003-11-27

Before starting grad school earlier this year I had never had any reason to know how to use PowerPoint, but when the time came to learn, I had to get with it fast. The directions that come with the stand alone Microsoft product are pretty weak, so I bought this manual as the best for comprehensiveness and being comprehendible by an average MS Word user.<br />This book is not for the super technical, programmer types, but works great for the other 95% of us.

Earlier in the week I consulted it about putting video into a slide, which I had never done before. Now I have a very dramatic multimedia presentation that looks great.<br />The salient point here is that I am not a huge PowerPoint expert, but this book makes me look like one. I gave it four stars only because it is a quite expensive book (remember it has all pages printed in color, and has a practice CD included), in fact twice the cost of many competing books. Although it is pricey, in the long run it is totally worth the expense.	2003-11-27

He told me when he gave it to me that it was his favorite book growing up (he was age 10-15 during World War Two) and that I should read it to better understand the human side of war. He couldn't have been more correct. I came to understand that even when the cause is noble, and the enemy leadership is evil, that war is a horrible thing, even when it is necessary.<br />Bill Mauldin, who died recently, was a national treasure. His characters Willy and Joe (themselves a national treasure) form the crux of his cartoons from that era, and they embodied everyman in the heroes of the war. For his work he eventually won a Pulitzer prize. Mauldin claimed to be more of a cartoonist than a writer, but the writing is, in my opinion, at least the equal of the cartoons. For people who have never been exposed to the human level, front line realities of war, this book is vital for understanding the men who fight for the freedoms we enjoy.<br />This is a wonderful book, and I wish that every high school student was required to read it when they studied World War Two in Europe. I am so glad to see it back in print. While I cherish the copy that my Dad gave me many years ago it is now very fragile. I am grateful to have a new copy to thumb through on my bookshelf. If you read any one book this year on World War Two, this has to be it. It will make you proud to be an American, and proud of the men who fought for freedom sixty years ago.	2003-11-26

I have kept up with the the Annals of Improbable Research for many years and this truly reflects some of the best efforts of scientists the world over. In this volume we have works by legitimate Nobel prize winners, and lesser known works such as &quot;Gummy Worm on a Sidewalk&quot; by Kate and Jesse Eppers, ages 12 and 10, respectively. (In their conclusion they noted that: &quot;We came to a conclusion that three out of five people will accidentally step on a gummy worm thrown on a sidewalk.&quot; Brilliant.)<br />Highlights for me include: &quot;The Laser Cheese Raclette&quot;, &quot;The Effects of Peanut Butter on the Earth's Rotation,&quot; and, of course, &quot;Internet Barbie and the Time Caplet.&quot; There are too many to go into, but almost all are delightful. I guess the only minor critique would be of the couple of pages of limericks, which I find a bit trying, particularly when the subject matter is &quot;Mastodon, Mother, and Babe.&quot;<br />Overall a wonderful, humorous look at scientists and science through a very different lens than most are used to.	2003-11-26

The detail on different ships and lines is excellent, though I personally think that the Berlitz book &quot;Ocean Cruising &amp; Cruise Ships 2003&quot; is more detailed on the ships themselves, and is generally easier to use than &quot;The Unofficial Guide to Cruises 2003,&quot; though both have strong and weak points.<br />The strength of this book is in the complete and clear explanations of every aspect of a cruise for someone new to cruising. Some people like the breakdown by separate quality and value scales, but I didn't find it particularly user friendly, and often was scratching my head trying to resolve the grades received with narrative about particular ships. Once again, I think Berlitz has a more straightforward numerical system where it is clear why each ship got the overall score that it got.<br />While I prefer the Berlitz book marginally, this is also an excellent book with it's own unique viewpoints and strengths. My strategy has become to use the two books in tandem, as together there is a complete picture that neither book completely captures on it's own. Overall a noble effort and in the end this book is recommended for anyone considering a cruise, especially first time cruisers.	2003-11-23

Little known Columbus, Indiana is one of the most progressive of all American cities architecturally, largely due to the benevolence of the Cummins Engine Company. Cummins, one of the largest employers in the area, set up a grant of money whereby nationally renowned architects would come in and design the major public buildings of Columbus, with Cummins footing the bill for the architecture. This more that anything accounts for the proliferation of beautiful structures throughout the city.<br />My personal favorite works are the churches and schools. The churches, particularly the North Christian Church on Tipton Lane, are absolutely unique and magnificent. The North Christian Church (1964) was the last building designed by famed architect Eero Saarinen before his death. It is one of two churches by Saarinen in Columbus, the other being the First Christian Church at 531 Fifth Street built in 1942. It was one of the first contemporary (versus traditional Gothic) churches in the United States, and certainly the first in Columbus. It is a masterpiece, but a bit more Spartan than the later elegant North Christian Church.<br />There are many other examples of outstanding architecture well covered here, for example the Fodrea Community School on Illinois Street, and the Mount Healthy Elementary School on State Road 58. These two were at the vanguard of 'people centered' schools with more large open space and fewer formal classrooms.<br />All in all the book is excellent, even including a locator map to help you take a self guided tour of architectural Columbus. Why only four stars? Basically for three reasons: the book is entirely black and white and therefore requires a bit of imagination when the text describes colorful features of structures; the spine of the book itself is rather brittle so care must be taken not to over-articulate the pages and break the spine, and most importantly, because of it's age. The book is in desperate need of a new edition to document changes and new developments since the last edition was published. Overall, though, a commendable and very noble effort!and most importantly, because of it's age.

One of my best friends is an English professor at a four year university, and is even more stunned by what crosses his desk. After listening to them grouse, I got a degree in biology and became an airline pilot.<br />This collection spans several decades of student essays and exams from a history professor and some of his associates. There are so many delightful errors in this book that I can't pick a favorite, but I will share three selected at random:<br />&quot;The Russian revolution of 1905 began about 1907. Unfortunately, the Czar was easily influenced by flutterers. The Triple Alliance faced NATO. This too was produced by Bismark, who worked for Caesar at the time.&quot;<br />&quot;Japan boomed Pearl Harbor, the main U.S. base in southern California. American sailors watched in shock as the sky filled with Japanese zebras.&quot;<br />&quot;History grundled onward. International relationships moved to the broodle stage.&quot;<br />As you can see, there is no stopping the silliness (and, yes, I did recheck the spelling in the three examples to ensure it was exactly as written)!<br />Buy this book!

I have always been fascinated by the Apollo program, and have always found the mission control team interesting. (I highly recommend 'Failure is not an Option' by Gene Kranz.) When I heard that Sy Liebergot had written a book, I pre-ordered it. I generally found the book interesting but not as focused on the Apollo program, NASA or the EECOM job as the title would imply.<br />I am amazed by the hardships that Sy overcame and my hat is off to him for that, I just wish that his first book had focused more on Apollo and EECOM duties (after all, the title is 'Apollo EECOM') and less on his personal tribulations.<br />There is one incredibly redeeming feature of the book, though, and it is the enclosed CD, which is a series of recordings of the EECOM loop during the Apollo 13 near disaster as well as some Apollo 15 audio and a spoof song for the post Apollo 13 party.<br />Overall, a good book, but the CD alone is worth the cost!	2003-11-13

My problem is largely in the self important, stilted writing style which is particularly notable in Chapter 3 under ecological factors (in which some popular, but scientifically questionable, theories seemingly influence the author's thinking detrimentally). As an aside, but a very distracting one, the layout of the book is absolutely horrid. There are numerous inserts, fact boxes, exhibits, and case studies scattershot throughout the book seemingly at random, which substantially breaks up the text. Additionally, many of the text boxes and examples involve copious texts and backgrounds in blue ink, which I am sure raised the production costs of this already very expensive book needlessly (not providing increased value to the end user...you would think they would read their own book).<br />Largely the chapters are enormous lists with overly wordy jingoistic explanations. The section on &quot;SWOT Analysis&quot; is particularly annoying. It tries to sound like it is based on highly scientific principles, whereas, in reality, it is still a bunch of subjective value judgments. (Guesses, mostly, in actuality.) The terminology rarely cuts through to the central point, making the book enormously long and unwieldily. Likewise, it is very difficult to look up things as much of the information is scattered in seemingly illogical places.<br />Overall, I obviously did not like this book, but gave it two stars despite it's faults due to some of the interesting case studies it contains. There are some excellent, thought-provoking cases examined. Unfortunately, there is insufficient discussion of these cases, which would have proven beneficial. The case studies aren't totally unbiased, either, as they largely are lifted directly from 'Business Week' (whose name and logo even appear on the cover) so is 'Business Week' didn't think it important, there is probably a dearth of information in the book on that subject.dearth of information in the book on that subject.	2003-11-12

Pastore. The transcripts are fascinating reading for serious students of naval history or (especially) systems safety (my particular interest). Though the hearings were held in 1963 and 1964, there are many sections which are annotated 'Classified Matter Deleted.' In all likelihood some of this information could be recovered now with an FOIA request, I suspect. Despite the classified editing the main points are unmistakable.<br />The study eventually faulted then accepted construction and inspection techniques for the loss of the Thresher (as did the Navy's separate investigation), particularly focusing on the inadequacy of using silver brazed (vs. welded, which was more complex and expensive) joints in high pressure salt water piping systems. Also believed to be directly causal was the air deballasting system, which was found to not have been adequately tested, and in testing on sister ship SSN 606, USS Tinosa was, in fact, found to be faulty. Specifically due to pressure and (therefore) temperature differentials in the system, upon a max effort blow the filter screens would develop ice on them, restricting air flow and therefore the ability of the sub to surface rapidly in an emergency. Admiral William Brockett discusses this so called 'critical flow situation' and freezeup issues at great length. Also discussed in great detail is the propensity of the then revolutionary HY-80 steel to crack at welds, and it's use in submarine hull construction. Admiral Rickover testifies regarding extra precautions taken in the nuclear plant section of the sub, and in personnel system shortcomings in the Navy and shipyards in which top management and leadership changes frequently (unfortunately, this is still an issue in the military 40 years later).<br />All in all, this is a very useful document for safety professionals, which is why I gave it 5 stars, but be forewarned, it is not light reading and is very technical in nature. From the investigation on the loss of the Thresher, many improvements were made in the nuclear subs of the US Navy. Since Thresher only one more US sub sank (The USS Scorpion, SSN 589, off the Azores in 1968).

I have read many books from introductory student pilot texts to Operating Manuals for the A-320, L-1011 and B-747-400 in my aviation career, but if I had to pick any one book that best explains the nuts and bolts of advanced turbine flying, this is my pick, with no close second. This book has no peer.<br />Jim Webb makes this information come alive and makes often difficult to grasp (or remember) concepts like weather and aircraft performance second nature. I have instructed in many models of jet transports, and when I can't find an answer to a tough question, I never fail to refer to my well used copy of &quot;Fly The Wing.&quot; Many of Webb's examples reference information specific to the DC-9 and L-1011, but understand that the general points being made translate equally well to all commercial jets. As a side note, I have been to school on both the DC-9 and L-1011, and Webb's information is as good as gold, which reinforced the solidness of the underlying text for me.<br />If you are a turbine pilot now or have any interest at all in becoming one, this book is absolutely indispensable to have on your bookshelf. If you are a student, private, or new commercial pilot, this book has loads of accessible, relevant, and important information for you. Don't worry about the turbine specific information and you will still find this a most worthwhile book to read. No pilot should be without it!	2003-11-09

Books	5	20	20	N	Y	Wombats, Mollusks, and Greek Literature All In Moderation	Will Cuppy has written a very strange, very funny little volume that covers a lot of territory. Ostensibly, it is mainly devoted to an overview of animal characteristics, and includes a great deal of odd and relatively unknown facts on a myriad of animals (my undergraduate degree is in Biology, and I learned many peculiar things from this book).<br />The amazing thing about the book for me is the literate weaving of a coherent book which includes not only an explanation of the head-foot and lifestyles of lower mollusks, but a tracing of literary references of mollusks through history, from the ancient Greeks to Wordsworth (really). That kind of surreal juxtaposition runs throughout the book, and is perfectly delightful. The net result is a book that it genuinely educational, and simultaneously hilarious.<br />Cuppy has a wonderful way with words, indeed he has a rich vocabulary and elegant writing style that is mostly forgotten in contemporary writers. I wish this book was compulsory reading in all high schools (take your pick in English or Biology class) to expose students to the concept that a book, even with a sometimes strange or mundane subject, can be utterly fascinating when told well.<br />My only minor critique of the book is the relative abundance of footnotes, which is sometimes a bit distracting. If you want a good laugh, or you just love animals this book is a good choice. It turns out that wombats are pretty interesting, believe it or not!	2003-11-09

I used this book and associated software (which you must download) in a graduate Aviation Route Planning class, and this book takes every opportunity to disappoint.<br />Understand that this is a simulation guide and you must use the simulation as part of a registered class. As for faults, there are many. The most glaring error is the almost total absence of information related to selections you must make from the very beginning. There is essentially no discussion of pros and cons of various options presented, therefore if any of the information is not completely understood prior to beginning the class (which obviously defeats the purpose of the class) errors can be made which can prove disastrous for the remainder of the simulation. Only my long history in the industry assisted me in making reasonable choices in the numerous gray areas.<br />If you insist on taking a class that uses this simulation, buy a comprehensive airline management text and read it prior to starting the class (perhaps the books by Douganis would be most helpful). Don't even think about buying this for personal use; you will get nothing from it.<br />As an aside, the software is extremely buggy (for myself and many others in my class), so be prepared to enter all decisions multiple times, have data disappear, never be able to find your information, etc.<br />All in all this is without peer in the truly horrible textbook category. If you can take an equivalent course based on case studies, or for that matter ANY other text, by all means do so. I was obviously very disappointed by this book (and software): it sounded like a good idea at the time, and I genuinely thought it could prove of value to my knowledge of the materiel; instead all I got was indigestion.	2003-11-08

I saw it in a book store and balked at the price tag, but was rescued when I received it as a gift. Now that I have seen it I can honestly say that it is worth far more than the list price. This is simply the greatest compendium of comics ever.<br />The books are beautifully bound, and the set is VERY heavy (remember to lift with your legs, not with your back) and very large. That brings me to my only complaint about the set, which is that at a bit over 14 inches tall, the books will not sit in most standard bookcase shelves, so I have to figure out someplace else to put them now. It is a small price to pay for all of Larson's brilliance (and Cow Tools, too)!<br />The books are very well printed and many of the panels are in color (even some of the original black and white panels) which to me adds to the beauty of the books, although I understand some purists have objected to the 'colorization.'

It is basically a box full of souvenirs from Apollo 11. It contains replicas of several artifacts from the Apollo 11 mission contributed by the Astronauts (and from the Smithsonian). Sample contents are a replica of a page from Collins' 'solo book' he kept in the CM while Armstrong and Aldrin were on the moon, copies of photos of Aldrin's children left on the moon, and most amusingly a copy of Armstrong's travel voucher claiming as destination &quot;moon.&quot; <br />There is also a brief and interesting short paperback book (more a pamphlet, actually) recounting highlights of the Apollo 11 mission. It doesn't contain any new revelations, but is a good general treatment of the mission.<br />I rated this as 5 stars for it's uniqueness and originality. Serious Apollo historians will not find any new information in the box set, but it IS an interesting compendium for anyone. This would also be perfect for someone just becoming interested in space flight, and could be handled by any reader from approximately ninth grade level.	2003-11-05

The book probably would have received five stars if it was available in a more up to date version and/or more individual technologies had been explored (hopefully 'Our Own Devices', his newest book will rectify both points). A revised edition would be most welcome. (For instance in the section on computers the Pentium chip had just been released.)<br />Tenner's gift is in his ability to take very complex subjects with a myriad of unseen interactions and to explain the outcomes in a logical, readable and comprehensive manner. This would be an excellent book to use in a systems safety course, along with James Chiles' 'Inviting Disaster,' which is also an excellent read.<br />The ability to explain revenge effects, reverse revenge effects and the like on a number of diverse subjects from sports medicine to forest fire prevention makes this a must read for safety professionals, as well as making it fascinating reading for anyone with an interest in the world as it interacts with technology.	2003-11-03

I am not a submariner, and I doubt that if I were that I would be so captivated as it is mostly a sociological study of the crewmen and their interactions on a Trident submarine on a three month underwater voyage. I am in a technology intensive profession, and am interested in the technical details of the sub, which is why I initially bought the book, but came to enjoy the complex interactions of the men on the sub more than the actual submarine specific information.<br />The professionalism of this group of people is one of the great untold (or nearly so) stories of the cold war and modern times. I was impressed with the incredible amount of training and simulations while on a typical cruise. As an airline (and former Air Force) pilot, I am more than aquatinted with training and simulation, but these men really take the concept to a whole new plane (no pun intended).<br />If you have any interest in submarines, and more specifically, life aboard a modern nuclear missile sub like the 'Nebraska,' you will love this book.	2003-10-22

There is virtually nil on the actual itineraries, but there is an abundance of insight into the technical details of the ships themselves, and more importantly excellent analysis of a ship's ambiance, which is critical for making a good decision on whether to cruise on a specific ship or not (e.g., the differences between a Celebrity ship and a Carnival ship).<br />Before I consider a cruise on a specific ship, I open this wonderful book up and read the entry for that ship, and have never been disappointed with the informative analysis and technical information. I just finished a Bermuda cruise on the Celebrity 'Horizon,' and found the book to be right on target, and the cruise to be perfect.<br />One minor nitpick, that does not really detract from the overall value of the book (but would be nice in future editions) is the general absence of information on the ships that specialize in coastal cruising in Norway (Norwegian Coastal Voyage). I know that is a fairly specialized area, but there are many other specialized ships in here.<br />If you are interested in itinerary details, this book is of limited use, but if you use it in the planning stage, you will greatly increase your chances of a great cruise suitable for you.	2003-10-22

Obviously, the central point of the book that a full scale invasion of Iraq is the best option left to the world, while exhaustively analyzed, is now moot. The book is still vital to an understanding of the most recent Iraqi war and the events leading up to it, and, most importantly, why it was necessary.<br />Kenneth Pollack spent seven years in the Clinton regime as an Iraqi analyst (and was one of only three analysts in the government who had previously predicted the invasion of Kuwait under the first Bush administration). I had expected a softer stance on invasion, given his long association with the Clinton White House, but was pleased with his balanced views of the three most recent administrations (and Reagan's, to a lesser degree). He lays bare the faults in the initial containment framework as implemented in the various UN programs after Desert Storm, and explains is painstaking detail why Containment failed as a concept under Clinton. (Hint: France, China, and Russia, are the biggest culprits, but not the only ones.)<br />The most impressive feature of this work is the scope of the book. The first part of the book is essentially a quick history of Iraq and Saddam. The information in that part of the book is vital for an understanding of the situation we had to deal with prior to the invasion and to understanding the fallout of the war.<br />The bulk of the book deals with analyzing all possible strategies for dealing with Iraq from deterrence to invasion. Ultimately, the author concludes (and I believe correctly) that in the long term invasion was the last resort, but the only one that would work. He particularly focuses on the Iraqi threat in the middle east to include terrorism in the Saudi oil fields, making the point that if Saddam had ever been able to control or harm Saudi oil production that the world economy would be plunged into a depression at least as severe as the Great depression in the US.<br />Since the war is over from the military point of view (policing is left, of course), it is easy to grade his predictions on the results of the war, and Pollack is generally spot on (the exception, is that he underestimated the cost of rebuilding Iraq, as he had considered Iraqi oil revenues as a contributor, whereas the Bush administration largely has not). I would hope that those in Washington seek Pollack's counsel on Iraq. When they disregarded him in the past (especially notably in the disregard he received under Clinton from William Christopher and Madeline Albright), problems quickly developed.<br />This is not an easy read. Often I had to review passages several times to grasp all the information presented, but in the end, my knowledge of Iraq is now hugely superior from what it was before reading this book. If you really want to understand Iraq (whether you were pro-war or antiwar) this is THE must read book.as severe as the Great depression in the US. <br />Since the war is over from the military point of view (policing is left, of course), it is easy to grade his predictions on the results of the war, and Pollack is generally spot on (the exception, is that he underestimated the cost of rebuilding Iraq, as he had considered Iraqi oil revenues as a contributor, whereas the Bush administration largely has not).

This book is full of much the same kind of stuff only it is more repetitious and comes across as being more highbrow.<br />There are certain passages that really come across to redeem this book though, for instance: \\"I had hated several big vinyl houses in front of my house for about 20 years because the vegetables in these houses have the same feeling of melancholic...A week ago when I walked beside these vinyl houses, I talked to the vegetables in these vinyl houses. By using my third attention, I said to these vegetables 'Please, excuse human beings who will eat you soon. Don't get perverse as long as you live on the earth.'...When such a message could reach the vegetables in the vinyl house by me, beautiful transparent flash suddenly lightened in the vinyl house by me and the vegetables turned to be lively. Then I could feel relieved and joyful.\\"<br />Never since Pedro Carolino walked the earth has such gibberish been presented quite so eloquently. I gave this book three stars because I honestly didn't know what to do with it. If you read it for serious advice it is worth one star, if you read it for it's humor quotient, it's worth five, so I split the difference.umor quotient, it's worth five, so I split the difference.	2003-09-27

I bought the book simply to have a title this unusual in my collection of odd books, but it is not what I expected (although with a title like this, how tasteful could it have possibly been?) Kenny loses 30 pounds in as many days due to a persistent case of diarrhea, hence the title. Amongst the buffoonery in Mexico Kurt previews some poems and songs he has been working on, most of which deal with a recent romantic break up.<br />There are many strange occurrences, some of which amused me greatly such as the directions for making iguana soup. (Really.) What I did not enjoy were the excessive drug references, which were the focus of the book, as it turned out. For instance after eating a meal of turtle eggs, honey and hallucinogenic mushrooms, the author had this to say:&quot; I told the kings of Safeway, 'Don't let my groceries get hard.'&quot; Drill the oblique niceties. Girdled mannequin. Endless tour of underground mazes. Grouchy blackwater frogmen from Boise, Idaho slinking and staking out you for a meal, eyes bugging out and claws made of steel. Idiot! Jerk! Stupid! Gather. Disperse.&quot; That is one of the more lucid passages. If you like drug induced depravity, this book is perfect for you. I don't, so I didn't appreciate it in general.	2003-09-22

Weaver exposes the many pitfalls of modern liberalism and moral relativism. The book was originally written in 1948, and clearly shows the influence of then recent World War 2. All of the chapters have powerful arguments, especially &quot;The Great Stereopticon,&quot; which exposes the propagandistic humanistic left-wing bent of the media (print, film, radio, and television) and the destruction laden on contemporary society by the different media outlets. Other important chapters are &quot;The Spoiled-Child Psychology&quot; (a discourse on materialism and sloth), and &quot;The Power of the Word,&quot; a chapter on changing word usage through time and foreshadowing the destructive effects of modern 'politically correct' terminology.<br />This is an extremely weighty, dense book. I generally liked the contentions found within it, but found the stilted language somewhat annoying. As an example, consider this passage from the opening of the chapter titled &quot;Piety and Justice&quot;, which is all too typical: &quot;I would maintain that modern man is a parricide. He has taken up arms against, and has effectually slain, what former men have regarded as filial veneration.&quot; Until going to the dictionary I was unaware that a parricide was &quot;one that murders his or her father, mother, or a close relative.&quot; Perhaps I should have known that, but my complaint is clear, reading this otherwise wonderful and informative book can be extremely tedious.<br />Having said that, I do recommend this book with the reservation that passages will need to be read and reread several times, and you will need to be prepared to consult a dictionary for words in English, French, German, Latin and Greek that you may not know. There are several amusing portions of the book, my favorite being the chapter in which he assaults Jazz as the music that will oversee the downfall of civilization. I only wish he could have lived to see Rap. The book as a whole is an amazingly accurate predictor of societal ills, amazing in their scope considering that it was written nearly 55 years ago.he book as a whole is an amazingly accurate predictor of societal ills, amazing in their scope considering that it was written nearly 55 years ago.	2003-09-21

Buzz Patterson is frank and comes across not so much as a person with an ax to grind (in fact he seems downright apologetic at having to criticize his former boss) but as a professional involved with an administration of broad incompetence and ignorance. This, then, is really a cautionary tale and plea, not to elect Republicans, per se, but to elect people who grasp military strategy and national security realities, which of course was not the case in the Clinton administration.<br />The book is a story of Patterson and his relationship to Clinton for the two years of duty as an aide assigned to carry the 'nuclear football.' There are many alarming insights in the book, most frighteningly how Clinton lost his set of nuclear codes, the most important piece of paper in the world, for an indefinite period of time during one on his many scandals. Noteworthy also is the cavalier attitude with which he (and especially his staff) treated the military, with chapters on everything from the Somalia ('Black hawk Down') debacle to refusing to take out bin Laden when given the opportunity (especially in light of the fact that he was known to be behind several bombings and the USS Cole attack). The list goes on and on. How we gave North Korea two nuclear plants in return for nonproliferation agreements (and look where we are now...Thanks, Bill), how we knowingly allowed Loral and others to sell 'dual-purpose' technology to China, vastly enhancing their nuclear weapons delivery capabilities, and how seats were essentially sold on Air Force One to big Democratic donors. The list goes on and on. Don't miss the sections on Hillary's influence on the White House (people from New York, pay particular attention). Likewise, do not mention the sections on Al Gore, whose personal distaste for military people is so extreme that even when greeted courteously, he would totally ignore them. (As a side note, I formerly was a C-9 pilot in the Air Force and knew several people in the Presidential Pilot Office at Andrews AFB, and they confirmed this behavior privately to me.)<br />The single most useful device in this book is the chronology of major foreign policy events of the Clinton years. The list puts many events of those years into context and focus.<br />If you adore Bill and Hillary (and Al), you will probably not want to read this book, but you desperately need to. If you want a candid view of daily life in the Clinton White House, this book is excellent.in the Presidential Pilot Office at Andrews AFB, and they confirmed this behavior privately to me.)<br />The single most useful device in this book is the chronology of major foreign policy events of the Clinton years.

This book is kind of like if Dave Barry authored a Fodor's Guide on Moldova. I loved his earlier 'Round Ireland With a Fridge,' and consequently bought this volume. I prefer the Ireland book, as it is a little less dark, and a little more travelogue, but I am quite fond of this one as well.<br />The plot basically concerns a bet about his being able to defeat the entire Moldovan National soccer team at tennis. His quests take him to Moldova, naturally enough, Northern Ireland, and Israel to play all the team members. Travel to Moldova is very difficult, and will definitely be off your list of potential vacation destinations after reading this book.<br />I found the book funny and warm, and especially enjoyed the relationships formed with the family members he stayed with in Moldova. The last thirty or so pages are absolutely exquisite, and I won't ruin the surprise ending, other than to say it is wonderful, and I didn't see it coming. I anxiously await a new book from Tony at the earliest possible moment!	2003-09-18

They are quite complete and interesting, as is the background and history of the aircraft. I also enjoyed the reprint of the flight manuals, though you will discover that there are essentially two very similar sets of flight manual information that are fairly redundant.<br />Unfortunately, there is a relative dearth of information on the individual test flights themselves, with only general summaries being provided. For a better overall look at the program, I would recommend &quot;At The Edge of Space&quot; by X-15 pilot Milt Thompson (with forward by Neil Armstrong). The Thompson book is better at explaining the actual workings of the missions and results obtained, I feel. An added feature in the Thompson book is a detailed account of the Mike Adams accident in the third X-15, a subject of great interest to any potential readers of this book, but essentially glossed over in the NASA Mission Report.<br />In summary, I think this is a useful book, it is filled with extensive documentation from the program, and will be of great use to aerospace historians. My reservation is that, basically, it is a systems and contracting history book rather that a Mission Report.	2003-09-14

I used this book (and that CD that came with my edition) as part of a college algebra course that I took to brush up on basic math so I could do well on the GMAT and GRE.<br />I have a good background in math so didn't find the information very challenging, which is good, as the people in the class who had a less mathematical background struggled with the text and CD all semester.<br />The book is not all that well organized and still has a lot of politically correct and new math filler for my taste. Most annoyingly, every time a new concept is introduced, the first technique presented is to guess a solution to the problem, and then see if you are correct. I grasp that Martin-Gay is trying to use the concept of reasonableness of answers, unfortunately, most students don't get it.<br />If you happen to have an edition with a CD-ROM, good luck. I had continuous computer and program errors when I used the program, and in fact my computer (at the time with Windows ME) began crashing regularly after I installed the software (I complained about this constantly to my teacher) which it had never done before. I can't prove the PHIM software did it, but I can't imagine what else it may have been. This edition may not even come with the CD, I can't tell from the description, so you may be safe. I just suggest extreme caution if you ever happen to run any PHIM software.<br />To sum up here, if you take a course where this is a required text, be ready to ask lots of questions in class, and beware of the software. Better yet, try and get into another section that uses a different book. If you are interested in a basic algebra book for independent study, please buy any other algebra book.	2003-09-07

The commentary and 'interviews' are the best part of the work, poking fun at everyone involved, especially art critics (fortunately). The authors have the stuffy self-importance of the critical world down perfectly, right down to the 'references', for example: &quot;The artist's depiction of a green-eyed purple cat as a metaphor for monster...draws a clear parallel between the socially noxious effects of television and the environmentally destructive consequences of feline-avian conflict in the urban context,&quot; - D. Koplos, The Green-Eyed One-Tailed Spying Purple Parrot Eater. L.A. Art Times, 2001.<br />The work is startlingly original and can be read on several levels. I heartily recommend it in every way.	2003-09-07

It is an introduction to accident theory for generalists, and is as interesting (perhaps more so) to nontechnical people as it is to engineers and the like. James Chiles discusses several major accidents (Challenger, Three Mile Island, Ocean Ranger, etc.) in well executed chapters with substantial background from previous precursor accidents or incidents. One reviewer seems to believe that this is a flaw, but I disagree. The reviewer seems to believe, for instance, that the R101 (a dirigible, not a blimp, as the reviewer wrongly states) is totally irrelevant to Challenger. In fact R101 was the Challenger of it's day, and the social, managerial and technological pressures that ultimately led to the R101 disaster ultimately led to Challenger as well. Chiles ties this theme together in a seamless manner in chapter after chapter.<br />This book is not a rigorous technical analysis of the individual disasters with the engineering and math associated with formal inquiries and technical (AAIB, NTSB, etc.) investigations. What it does better than any of the technical inquiries could ever do, though, is make a clear a compelling case for the problems that led to each of the accidents covered, treating man-machine interface issues with particular grace.<br />I have long been associated with the more technical aspects of accident investigation and safety systems, but have to say that while there are more technical accounts available for all of these accidents, if you are looking for an entry level (but complete) overview of accidents and systems safety, you can't go wrong with this book.	2003-09-06

This is a photo tour of Unarius and their charismatic leader Ruth E. Norman. <br />Unarius is a weird new age thing. These folks basically are big reincarnation people and are always going on about the 'Space Brothers' and 'The Golden Vortex.' It seems that they believe that we are one of 33 worlds about to have a big galactic convention (in California, of course). They really enjoy dressing up as things like the Ambassador from the planet Po (really). <br />The book must be seen to be believed. I actually think that Ruth Norman was a nice lady who happened to be a bit different (well she had been just about everyone...I think DaVinci and Julius Caesar amongst others). Ruth died a couple of years ago, so in the highly unlikely event that she was correct, she could be coming to a vortex near you.	2003-09-06

The premise is that due to a bet while under the influence he has to hitchhike around the perimeter of Ireland in a month. The fact that he paid more for the fridge than the value of the wager makes the concept even more entertaining. Some have criticized (I believe unfairly) the book for not being a detailed travel journal. I think that is a factually correct statement, but the point here is not to be a serious travel guide, but to be a humor book about funny experiences during a very odd odyssey.<br />There are many amusing moments in the book, some of which are so well written that they made me laugh out loud. Purists may argue that it is a rather smallish fridge, but I don't think that matters; it's the concept of hitchhiking in a foreign country with a large, ungainly peculiar object that matters here.<br />Tony Hawks is a very strange, and very funny man. If you are interested in a book filled with unusual comic characters and situations, this would be hard to beat.	2003-09-06

I believe that the plane was decades ahead of it's time, and still has some features (Direct Lift Control, which accounted for it's superior Autoland system, and an enormously sophisticated Speed Command System for example) that are unrivaled today. I was fortunate enough to check out and get a type rating on the L-1011 near the end of her life at the major airlines, and in every respect I believe she was the best designed aircraft I have ever flown. I can't recall meeting an L-1011 pilot who would disagree with that.<br />Jim Upton has put together an excellent book on the 1011, and I highly endorse it. In this one volume he accurately summarizes the operations and features of this beautiful machine. The photographs are clear and plentiful, the systems descriptions are well done (and will be the best you can see unless you get a 2,000 page L-1011 operations manual), and the format is logical and accessible. Buy this book and learn about one of the greatest airliners to ever grace the sky.	2003-09-06

Felton and Fowler have come up with many odd entries: Worst Senatorial Rationale, Most Unusual Concession to Modesty, Best Cucumbers, etc. You will learn that the world's worst acronym is PUMCODOXPURSACOMLOPOLAR (which stands for Pulse Modulated Coherent Doppler-Effect X-Band Pulse-Repetition Synthetic-Array Pulse Compression Side Lobe Planar Array), and much, much more.<br />I read the whole thing on a trip to Iceland, and on occasion could not stop laughing (even on the plane). The book's only drawback is that it is actually a compendium of two previous books published a few years ago, so it is not totally up to date with recent world silliness.<br />Read the book and laugh.

The book is very expensive, and in my view not really worth the money.<br />I have four fundamental issues with the book: numerous grammatical errors abound, and are actually distracting sometimes; the author is obviously very knowledgeable, yet is extremely repetitious...it is an easy read simply because the author says the same thing over and over again (I understand reinforcement, but this is ridiculous); some of the materiel is becoming out of date rapidly, while much of the rest is 'pie in the sky' theory; and finally, and most annoyingly, the author perpetuates the myth that you sound better when you speak in acronyms. This book is the worst I have ever seen for making up acronyms for no reason. I'm an airline pilot by profession, I understand the need for acronyms for things that are long and will be said repetitively, but is this really necessary: &quot;Aeronautical Fixed Service (AFS) refers to telecommunications between fixed points or ground stations...,&quot; when what he means is 'phone call?' That is just an example from opening the book at random. You will also be pleased to know that &quot;MIDANPIRG&quot; means &quot;Middle East Air Navigation Planning and Implementation Regional Group.&quot; I could go on, but you get the idea. When so much of the text is pointless acronyms, it becomes very tedious to read and fails to convey the author's intent (get some coffee, you will need it).<br />Now that I have slammed it's weaknesses, I will tell you about two strengths the book has. The first is that it is an excellent overall text detailing the Future Air Navigation System (as it is envisioned), and has good explanations of interrelationships of different components of the FANS. The second it the most useful to students: at the end of each chapter is an excellent summary detailing the key points in the chapter (this is where you want to go when you need to study or write a paper).<br />I was genuinely torn on what star rating to give.

He has taken a very complex subject, nearly forgotten due to time, and made it utterly relevant and engaging. For anyone with an interest in either space or computer history, this is a vital book.<br />It is somewhat technical (I had no idea how they made rope memory modules, an early ROM format before this book for instance), but Hall is very careful to explain things in terms that an average reader can readily understand.<br />The book itself documents the Apollo Guidance Computer from conception through numerous iterations and changes, to final successful lunar landings. Although the AGC capabilities seem trivial today, the AGC was the world's first Integrated Chip computer, and had enormous hurdles to overcome. In the end, of course, we know that Hall and his fellow employees at MIT did a good job...what I didn't know before was exactly what they had to do and the challenges they had to overcome.	2003-09-05

The book promised large gains in my aviation weather knowledge. I actually felt a little underwhelmed to be honest. This is, in essence, an introductory level aviation weather textbook.<br />I am a current airline pilot flying MD-80's, and think that as a General Aviation weather resource, this book is OK. It would be particularly useful for someone studying for their Instrument rating or initial Commercial certificate. For jet transport operations, though, this book is only marginally useful.<br />This book does contain good information, but understand that it is not very detailed information (I read the entire book in two hours in a hotel room), and is marginally useful to experienced turbine pilots. The book is partly redeemed by numerous case studies, that show the relevance of the materiel. The case studies are very interesting, but lack depth. For better case studies I recommend the NASA ASRS monthly reports (blue sheets) that are mailed free to interested people. For better real world weather flying, stick with Richard Collins for GA or &quot;Fly The Wing&quot; by Jim Webb for turbine flying.	2003-09-05

As an airline pilot who has flown (and generally disliked) the 737 among other airliners for a major US airline, I was pleased with the pains that Adair went through to be balanced in telling this story. It is generally a very accurate account of the accident sequence and investigation.<br />Of particular note is the ability Adair has to tell the story from all points of view, particularly from the victim's family and NTSB's point of view, without giving short shrift to Boeing (despite their general arrogance). In fact, the book, if anything, goes too easy on Boeing. The mantra about how safe the plane is repeated frequently. The reader is constantly told how safe the plane is, and then is told that the NTSB says it is less safe than it's peers, which seems hard to swallow. That it has a low accident rate (but NOT the lowest, as some have incorrectly stated, by any accepted statistical methodology, i.e., accidents per departure, accidents per flight hour, etc.) seems to permeate the book without emphasizing that so do all western built airliners.  At the end of the day when the NTSB does rule against the 737 rudder, it almost seems that Boeing is redesigning the rudder actuators out of the goodness of it's corporate conscience, rather than the FAA mandates, which doesn't really square with reality. (Bottom line, airlines have until 2007 to replace the faulty system with the new design, so basically you have 737s flying around with a known defect for upwards of 13 years, which is one reason I personally avoid flying on 737s unless there is absolutely no other choice available.)<br />My hat is off to Mr. Adair. Though I may quibble with the tone of certain sections of his book, it is, nonetheless, a masterpiece. Enjoyable for professionals and laymen alike.	2003-06-01

People who don't like him (liberals, predominantly), will not like this book. I largely find the book to be a positive, motivating work for true conservatives. I could do without some of the name calling (Jesse Hijackson, etc.) Even when cleverly and accurately done, I generally find that to be a turn off, and a show stopper to some readers who could otherwise benefit from the insights here (which are plentiful).<br />Good job overall. Michael earns his four stars from me by virtue of the message. The message is that we need to take America back in the direction originally intended by the Founding Fathers, and away from the lawyer oriented, socialist country that some would have America become. If you agree then you need to read this book. If you don't agree then you REALLY need to read this book.	2003-03-11

Of all the books I have read I always liked 'Thud Ridge' by Jack Broughton best...until now. While I still put Broughton right at the top of my list, and certainly at the top of my list of heroes along with Leo Thorsness, Ed Rasimus has written the definitive F-105 pilot memoir with 'When Thunder Rolled'.<br />I loved it from beginning to end; I only wish it had been longer. His recollections rang true as a scared young man who flew fighters in the beginning to a mature veteran fighter pilot at the end. I understood him better than I have other authors as I can totally understand the overwhelming fears of going to war compounded by being the new guy recently qualified a very intimidating machine flying into the worst conditions ever known.<br />Ed, if you read this: thanks for my new favorite Thud book and thanks for your service under the most trying conditions I can imagine. For everyone else: go buy this book NOW! You will not be disappointed!	2003-03-11
US	52988732	R326EFN9OHWNSB	1401004113	433947746	The End of an Era: my story of the L-1011	Books	3	14	15	N	Y	A Very Different View of The L-1011	I had absolutely no idea what to think of this book when I ordered it, as there was no description or information available on it that I could find. I bought it, as I am a huge devotee of the L-1011. I am by profession an airline pilot with type ratings in seven airliners including the L-1011, and consider the 1011 to be the best of the best, certainly the best of the early widebody aircraft. I was hoping for a pilot's perspective when I read this book, but that was just my personal bias. What I found was a work devoted to the management and financial aspects of the program.<br />That is not to say that it isn't an authoritative or useful book, it just will not be what the typical airliner fan (or pilot for that matter) will be most interested in. There is interesting information on the early contest vs. the DC-10 that is enlightening, but largely the book details financial arrangements at Lockheed.<br />The reason most people that know airliners love the L-1011 is it's incredible technological achievement (CAT IIIB, DLC, Flying Stabilizer, etc.), but here these are treated as an expensive waste of money. I am not saying Mr. West is wrong in his thinking, per se (the program DID lose money, after all), it is just that he sees the plane as a piece of metal and plastic, that is strictly a utility defined by a profit and loss statement. He does not seem to appreciate the longlasting strides in plane building and safety the TriStar made.<br />If you are really an L-1011 completist then by all means read it; it is good to have it available, just be aware it is not about the L-1011 itself, and contains no real technical information on the best airliner ever to grace the sky.	2002-08-13

The book was interesting, but not really what I expected. It is really more of a personal account of Grumman/LM Management decisions and functioning than anything else.<br />I found it to be a bit shallow on technical matters, but still overall worthwhile as there is really quite a dearth of information on the LM out there. People who really want the be all, end all LM technical information are probably better off reading The NASA Mission Reports series compiled by Robert Godwin. (In particular the Apollo 9,11,and 13 volumes are most illuminating about LM functionality.)<br />Overall, I would say a good, personal effort, but probably best  for people with a management bent, or after you have read everything else there is on Apollo.	2002-05-07

Chusid vividly tells the tales of the most incompetant, inept musicians in history with a genuine love and affection that makes this book a true joy to read. It may be my very favorite book of all time.<br />The concept of \\"outsider music\\" is one that I have embraced for years. While I don't deny liking some classical music and traditional album rock (Dire Straits, Lynyrd Skynyrd, etc.), I have always had a place in my heart for the struggling artists that just don't seem to (and never will) get it (like The Shaggs), others that DO get it, they just mock the norm (Brave Combo, PDQ Bach, etc.) and that peculiar group that are seemingly from Mars (Jandek, The Legendary Stardust Cowboy), that possibly get it, but are a so far beyond the norm that nobody pays attention to them.<br />This book is an unabashed celebration of ineptitude and (seeming) insanity. It is not to be missed, but when purchasing please make sure to buy the CD as well so you can grasp what he is talking about. Of particular note is the section on the famous MSR Song-Poems (where you send them $100 and your lyrics and they record your song) which, to me is the ultimate in outsider music.<br />I couldn't put it down. I can't recommend it strongly enough. Buy this book. Do it now!	2002-05-07

I was stunned at how much background information I was previously unaware of that Mr. Jenkins has unearthed. Although I have always been especially fond of the classic Anderton book on the 105, I think for depth of information this book is the one to beat. The chapters relating to unique configurations and missions (Ryan's Raiders, etc.) were particularly interesting. I also found the history of the Weasel program and the chronology of how the F transformed into the G to be especially revealing. This is a book that any serious student of the F-105 simply must have.	2000-12-19
