In North America there are only two examples of his work, the famed Watergate complex in Washington DC and the Tower of Change in Montreal Canada.  According to the authors, over his lifetime he produced seventy projects. <br /> <br />What this book gives is an insight into his remarkable career though his writings and pages of photographs.  They trace the evolution of his career, showing the roots of ideas germinate on various buildings. The scope of Moretti's work is highly varied, private apartments, apartment buildings, gymnasiums, corporate headquarters, vast plazas, Olympic facilities, etc. He was a commited Fascist, serving prison time for his views, and his popularity during Mussolini's time led to many projects. Most of those were vast in scale and were dominated by the Baroque, medieval influences that he so admired.  <br /> <br />The unifiying principle in his work is his mastery of concrete, making it float seemingly unsuspended in a variety of ways. For example, a staircase in the Casa del Balilla that looks like a chambered nautilus, or the magnificent fountains at Watergate that gracefully cascade several levels through the air. The underground parking garage of the Villa Borghese might be mistaken for a Stanley Kubrick movie set of a space station or a dramatic theatre set. He forces concrete to do the unbelievable, making the viewer think that the medium is as supple as plastic. This book is well worth the inveestment and the chance to learn about someone whose work has not received enoughr adulation.	2005-01-17

The denouement finally comes  in the last pages and she rushes it in a few paragraphs. It is a labor to read because of the dull writing and lack of imagination. Many issues are totally unbelievable. For example we are expected to believe that a woman running a castle in her 20s does not understand the loss of virginity! Lamb adds an elephabt to the story who adds nothing to the storyline.  She creates characters that are mentioned a lot and then have no real role in the storyline. Time is precious. Spend yours reading something else.	2004-07-04

In most of her other books Mason stops just short of rape and real cruelty to her heroines. Of the 30+ books I have read so far, this is by far the most sexually graphic and startling in terms of what she puts her through. Usually no other man \\"touches\\" the heroine unless she is widowed or he is dead.  This book envisions about the worst horrors that could befall a woman in that era, and she seems to experience all of them. It is somewhat difficult to imagine all of those things happening to the same woman, but the factual circumstances of that era are real, therefore giving plausibility to the storyline.<br />It is hard to either like or respect Tony.  He is almost always cruel to her, rarely gentle until well into the book.  There are characters, Nathan and Francis, both of whom embody a much finer character than Tony's, and I would have preferred her to chose one of them and leave this harsh selfish man.  But, her lot was sealed from the first and as an indentured servant, there was little she could do to escape her fate. But, not liking Tony's behavior does not constitute reason enough to give this book a bad rating.  It is well written and the storyline is fast paced and gripping.  It is as though watching the horrors unfold, the reader cannot believe that yet something more awful is about to happen.<br />I recommend this book to those who have a  strong stomach for a woman's survival in this era, and who enjoy Connie Mason as a good author.  Do not expect her usual formulic tales where evil mistresses eventually  vanish and deprivation usually means hero and heroines being separated with simple misunderstandings to overcome.	2003-12-02

This is one Regency romance where the author does not feel compelled to repeat the same agonizing thoughts in fifty different ways, but actually moves the plot with new thoughts and new actions. I found it hard to stop reading, and it is a short quick read.  I hope her other books are as wonderful as this one.	2003-07-09

This was my first Kurland book and I was bothered by the first part which has a repetitive style. The last part of the book was terrific. But, the more I thought about the story, and read subsesequnt books by this author which reintroduced many of the characters and updated their stories, the fonder I became of this one.

It is about a young woman living in present day Minnesota who is transported back to 1811 Regency England as a Gypsy ancestor. A magic ring is  responsible for this feat, as she casually wishes to meet Her Own True Love. The ring has a wicked sense of humor and an agenda of its own that makes it endearing. The first hundred pages were slow paced, until a plot twist kept the pages turning!  The ending was excellent, tying up loose ends in an amusing and creative manner.

Having read so many of her delightful other books, I was bored and disappointed with this sequel, which would have been better left unwritten. Part of the problem was the style, choppy going back and forth from a recent past to present.  If she had told that story first and then proceeded, it might have been more interesting.  Unlike her other novels, this one lacked pace and riveting plot lines.  It repetitively focused on the heroine's coldness and desire not to be wed, and her former lover's equal insistence that they would be. Other books are far better, such as Wings of the Storm, After the Storm, etc. Was her editor sleeping?	2002-07-23

It is a medieval time travel romance mystery--what happened to the time research team to lose their memories and years of their lives--set in the Middle Ages. The tale unfolds in a way reminiscent of Rebecca (DuMaurier), a little information revealed at a time in flashbacks. It has great humor as well sa a fast paced storyline, bringing back some characters from the first novel and answering some leftover questions about what happened to those characters. The romance is very well done, as is the ending.  Be careful about reading too much in other reviews as it will spoil the plot.	2002-07-08

A young half Asian woman is transported to medieval France by a wizard intent on rescuing his friend from a doomed future. It is unique in that most such stories usually have Caucasian heroines. Her Asian heritage is critical to the storylne because, being so exotic, people from this era mistake her for a demon or the like. In the modern world the heroine is a sort of film critic.  When she first arrives in medieval France, she is forced into the role of storyteller, and the stories she tells, based on movies, put into medieval terms, is hilarious.  &quot;Casablanca&quot; and the Godfather&quot; will never look the same to me again!

Compared to other books in this genre, this is a weak contender. The author attempts to convince the reader she is writing a &quot;Regency&quot; novel by overwhelming the story with adjectives such as &quot;jaded&quot; or &quot;cynical&quot;--obviously all heroes must be dukes no less, who radiate such qualities.

I only wish I had the talent to have written this absorbing story.  The author did indeed leave a number of questions hanging in the air, so to speak--including how the transmigration of souls happened, what happened ultimately to Morrigan, Charles' lack of interest in exploring how Elaine came to be his wife or why he tolerated the Boleighs and the disgusting Hattie in his house--but these details aside, Robin Schone spins a narrative that is gripping with mystery, fantasy, romance, and more explicit sex than seems to be the norm among this genre of writers.  It is by no means pornographic but is not designed for those who don't want to peep behind the bedroom door. Don't blast Ms. Schone for those who do enjoy details, just don't read her books!  <br />This is an unforgettable book by a highly creative writer.	2002-04-29

Ms. Quick shows in her many books that she is a scholar who does a lot of research into the background settings of her books.  This can range from all sorts of scientific facts to archeological information to, as in this book, the growing of herbs and flowers for essences and perfumes.  She creates characters in this book that are incredibly real, you can see them, sense them, even feel like you can touch them.  They are also immensely likable, and the chemistry between them is formidable. The plot in this book forms smoothly and the tension builds little by little until the great confrontation. Humor and double entendres are liberally sprinkled throughout the book, and make it a thoroughly enjoyable read.  But it is the touching love story between the characters that melts heartstrings and makes it a hard book to put down, and and even harder for the reader when it is ended.  It is an unforgettable romance.	2001-11-12

Almost always there is the young, independent  woman, spearheading rights for women, and acting more like a modern-day woman.  In this book, her heroine, Sophy, has radical notions for her time that constantly conflict with those of her husband's. One such issue is the question of how honor differs for a man and for a woman.  That forms the basis for the conflicts in the book, and it is handled in a very interesting manner.  Ms. Quick forces us to look at things through different eyes and perspectives.  <br />This may be my favorite Amanda Quick.  It is a totally charming book.  The love story between the 2 characters is one of her best.  The mystery is well-done. It is an amusing story that holds the reader enthralled to the end. HIGHLY recommended.	2001-11-05

The character development is outstanding, as they grow in relation to each other and to events, and the chemistry between the 2 main characters is palpable. It is a story of an Earl's intended revenge, but each time he thinks to finally leverage that revenge, his wife's belief in his truly higher nature, turns him away from the revenge he so desperately sought.

So, it was slightly disappointing to discover a book by her that was interesting, but that lacked the elements that make her usually a truly great writer--humor, wit, well-drawn characters and fast paced storylines. The characters here are okay, but the chemistry between them neither ignites nor develops believably. Unlike so many of her books which tell tales of the Ton, the main characters are more members of the Intellgentsia, and lack the social connections, entree and financial resources to be part of the Ton. Instead of owning fashionable things, they struggle to  earn what they can off the wealthy Ton. The secondary set of characters in this novel, the niece and the brother-in-law of the main characters are well-drawn and likable. This is a book worth reading, but only after having finished all her others, which are so much better.	2001-10-31

This book is riveting with its delightful humor, fast-paced action and exquisite love story between the 2 main characters. Ms. Quick writes about intelligent heroines, in this case a fossil collector who prizes old bones above wealth, jewels and Society. It is a charming tale of how she recognizes  the true nature of the man who becomes her husband, despite his dreadful reputation in Society. The chemistry between them is electric.

While many stars from several readers is always an indication that a book must be good, those with few stars do not necessarily mean the opposite, that the book is bad. This is one such book. As fans of Ms. Lindsey's many books know, and I have now read them all, Ms. Lindsey usually is an exceptional writer.  A few of her books are less fabulous, but even when they are not up to her very best, they are usually better than many other books out there.  In this series which includes Warrior's Woman and Keeper of the Heart, both better than this book, Ms. Lindsey has created a science fiction love fantasty that is quite extraordinary.  The first two books are absolutely gripping.  This one is not, but it has other things to recommend it.  First, it is VERY funny. The misunderstandings between planetary cultures are hilarious. Second, this is the book that fully explains all the culture, customs and everything a space rookie would want to know about living on a strange planet.  That tends to get tedious for many readers I think, unless they are sci-fi afficinados.  Also, she carries the plotline involving disbelief too long.  Instead of making the heroine Brittany come to terms with it as a side plot line, she makes that the dominant one of the book and it tends to get a little boring. I am not sure if I read an abridged version or censured version, but this book did not have the love scenes that so characterize her other books. So for readers primed to expect certain behavior from the characters, this book does not have it, and I suppose some may be disappointed as a result.  Again, am not sure if there is an abridged form or not.  For me, the negatives were minor as Ms. Lindsey's books always provide a wonderful excape mechanism.	2001-10-19

It is funny, the plot is gripping, the characters are magnetic, and the love scenes are memorable. It is the first in a triology that includes Keeper of the Heart and Heart of a Warrior.  In the last book of the series, Heart of a Warrior, Ms. Lindsey explains all the customs, culture and circumstances of the planet that the reader must ferret out in this and the second book.  Therefore, I would suggest reading the third book first, as it would not harm any of the storylines to read this group out of order.  It would also make reading all the books more enjoyable. Of the three books, this is the most enjoyable and has the most action. It is amazing that Ms. Lindsey has this incredible talent to write for so many different time periods and cultures in her books.  This is an extraordianry achievement, based as it must be, on imagination, unless she was secreted by Martha in Tedra's spaceship!	2001-10-19

The first chapters knock one's socks off, they are so powerful. They describe how an earl's daughter is kidnapped, drugged, and against her will, driven by the drugs to submit to the passionate love-making of a Russsian prince. It is one of the most explicit such scenes that Ms. Lindsey has written. While the plotline that follows is interesting, the first chapters are just so extraordinary,that the rest of the book seems to drag in places. Ms. Lindsey's humor and wit are rife throughout, and the book pulls at one's heartstrings. There does not appear to be a sequel to this story, even though the secondary characters in this novel could carry a sequel--Dmitri's sister Anastasia, his friend Vassili etc. This is well worth reading, especially at this time in the wake of the recent terrorist attacks on America, it is welcome respite.	2001-10-17

My personal favorite is Angel, but all these books are terrific. They should be read in order as the plotlines continue through the series.

And, this one is very, very good. Hated to finish this book as it was so engrossing and had me emotionally invovled.  This is the sequel to Glorious Angel, which introduced Hank Chavez, the hero, as a roguish outlaw. His appearance in that book, though fairly minor, was so strongly drawn, he almost stole the storyline.  Apparently Johanna Lindsey's mother thought the same thing, since in the dedication to this novel, JL thanks her mother for &quot;falling in love&quot; with Hank Chavez in the previous novel. She wasn't the only one to do so!  This is a superb love story between two very strongwilled people. Sometimes JL makes such relationships too strong and too stubborn--almost always they require a year of living apart once married to realize they cannot live without each other-- a theme she develops over and over in many of her books. In this book she has again created some minor characters that would lend themselves to books of their own, Lorenzo, Hank's faithful outlaw/rancher friend and Sheldon, Samantha's brother.  The latter closely resembles the Malory caracter of Warren. This book ranks in my top 5 favorites of JL and is worth re-reading many times.	2001-10-10

This is one of those books I truly adored, finished and then picked up immediately again to re-read and savor.  I think it is one of her best.  The story is a fairy tale that even the heroine does not believe--long exiled princess, growing up unaware of her identity, is kidnapped by 4 absolutely charming men and told she is being brought to a distant country, her homeland, to marry the King. There is much humor and amusing dialogue, gripping love scenes, adventure and action. The King himself is a wonderfully drawn character, as are his 3 men.  The pacing of the love story is well done, and never boring.  Read it and judge for yourself!	2001-10-04

Raised by an embittered father who was desperate for a son, the heroine is taught a man's skills in ranching and defending herself.  When her mother is allowed back into her life, she is introduced to her mother's stepson with whom she has a passionate affair. It is an interesting story set against the Wyoming frontier, replete with Indians that come across as real characters, not cardboard.  Ms. Lindsey writes with such flair that most of her books are truly a delight to read.  This is another one of them. I often have trouble with her titles as they seem to bear no relationship to the storylines.	2001-10-01

All I Need Is You is the sequel to A Heart So Wild, and what a sequel it is too! The first book traces the romance of the parents, Chandos Straton and Courtney Harte, the sequel is the story of one of their children, their daughter, Casey. To prove to her father that she is capable of running a major family ranching interest, Casey decides to take employment doing what a man can do.  She thus becomes a bounty hunter and is hired by Damian Rutledge to track his father's murderer.  It is an exciting tale, filled with humor and great plot development.  But perhaps, one of the more satisfying things is reading about the parents again, so deftly described in the first novel.  This is another of Ms. Lindsey's demonstrations of expert writing.  It is hard to put this book down, and it is a most enjoyable read.	2001-09-30

This is another of her success stories.  It is about a family travelling across the unsettled west that is seperated during an Indian raid.  The daughter finds evidence that her father is alive and sets out to find him with the help of the man she hires to protect her, a man of mystery who is a handsome gunslinger.  Great characters and storyline.  Highly recommend!	2001-09-29

The first is Fires in Winter and the third is Surrender My Love. I think this one was the best of the three, the characters better drawn and more likeable. It is an exciting book with a storyline that has plenty of action. In all three books Ms. Lindsey plays on the theme of slave/prisoner. She handles it differently each time so the theme does not become boring. This is a book worth reading, though not &quot;her best&quot;.	2001-09-28

I figured that so many readers could not be wrong. When I had finished reading most of her books, I decided to read this one anyway.  I found out that they WERE WRONG! Lesson learned: find out for yourself~ It is a love story of a beautiful girl who is captured by a pirate and ravished by him.  It turns into a passionate love story set in the Carribean amidst tropical scenery.  This is not one of my favorite Lindsey works, but Ms. Lindsey excels at writing even when she is not going full steam.  It is worth reading and savoring for what it is, a fine escapist novel with an exciting tale of romance.	2001-09-28

There is much humor and feeling in this book. Her heroine's laser-like wit is very funny, so clever in fact that it turns her into one of Lindsey's best characters. The hero is a great match, with an absolutely endearing determination to find ways to pleasure his wife. Given that so many heroes in these medieval novels tend to border on being brutish louts, this is a welcome change of pace. There are excellent subplots that tie together nicely with the hero's father and brother. This book is so entertaining that the reader will feel compelled to reread it several times. If you are looking for an enjoyable lift you cannot go wrong with this book!	2001-09-28

The other books are better, and this is the weakest of the three.  Yet, it is a delight to read about the characters from the previous books as their lives progress.  The heroine in this book, Erika, is a Dane, and is weakly drawn. The dashing eldest son of Lady Breena and Garrick from book one, Selig, is disappointing.  Other than his supposed good looks, he seems capable of real cruelty.  Yet, reading the other books first, one understands the genesis of it, that this is expected behavior of Vikings and part of his heritage, resembling his grandfather and father. This is not a bad book, but it is not brillant either and lacks her exciting plotlines and excellent character development.  But even when Ms. Lindey is not up to 5 stars, her books are worth reading.	2001-09-28

This is the story of the Viking Haardrad clan, and in this first book of three, the patriarch of the clan raids a village in  Great Britain and comes home with a woman slave for his son, the Lady Breena.  The catch is that this aristocratic Lady believed that she had been promised in marriage to this very same man by her now dead father. A promise that the Viking patriarch is all too happy to annul in his fury at these former enemies. Lady Breena is full of spunk and character, and is easily one of Johanna Lindsey's best heroines. Her &quot;master&quot;, Garrick, is less appealing, but their story is heart warming. Future books, Hearts Aflame and Surrender My Love (numbers two and three respectively) carry on with the stories of their children. This is an excellent book and well worth reading.	2001-09-28

This is not a Regency, Medieval, Viking, Sci-Fi Fantasy or Western Romance.  Rather it is a book with the backdrop of the romantic island of Oahu, Hawaii. It is a story of mutual hate turned to love.  There is nothing extraordinary about it, no memorable characters, not a gripping plotline, nothing that is the true hallmark of a fantastic Lindsey book.  Yet it is a pleasant read.	2001-09-28

Should I have worried knowing what gripping stories Ms. Lindsey always writes?  Never again!  This was a remarkable novel with a thriling love story which was enhanced by its western background. There is almost always some deception in her novels, between the hero and heroine, and this was no exception.  Ms. Lindsey has an uncanny ability to create  awesome heroes. Too bad she isn't one of those scientists mixing up DNA to create them for real!	2001-09-17

She is a witty, entertaining writer, and this book is thoroughly enjoyable. The plot is a trifle thin (one can easily guess the real villian) and at times the dialogue a little difficult to take. BUT, she does an outstanding job in developing her main characters and in giving them spunk and audacity. After I finished reading it, the story kept coming back and distracting me.  Only really good stories entertain like that long after they have been finished.	2001-09-17

Such &quot;joinings&quot; created powerful political and strategic alliances between members of the aristocracy. This book is aptly named, for it is the story of two families that wish to strengthen their ties to one another by betrothing their children, who as adults, are unhappy with the contract to marry each other. It is a delightful story, and the characters are interesting but Ms. Lindsey does not develop them as well as in many of her other books. She describes a &quot;different&quot; type of heroine, with many unusual abilities that could have been more utilized. Her subordinate characters, a half brother and a twin sister could also have had better roles. The twin had the potential to really add to the storyline, but she was mostly a background figure. These are minor criticisms compared to the pleasure Ms. Lindsey's novels always bring. This is a fine light read, perfect for briefly escaping the humdrum of real life.	2001-09-10

Some of her novels have incredible storylines that supersede the characters.  In this one, there is less action per se and more about the strong characters themselves, what they feel and why. One also gets a real sense of the time period and the way of life. Leonie's is not the story of a whiny heroine, but rather a woman of substance and intelligence. Ms. Lindsey has a knack for creating awesome heroes, and Rolf is no exception. The only problem is that she is so great at constructing such hunks, it makes reality all the more difficult when the novel ends, and we are forced to realize they are but fiction after all.	2001-09-08

In Man of My Dreams, we meet the Duke, Devlin, and Megan who becomes his wife.  Towards the end of that book, they have an unpleasant encounter with Lachlan, the hero of this book. Ms. Lindsey teases the reader with wanting to know him better, and in this book, we surely get to do that.  It is a wonderful story and different from so many others, in that the heroine of this book, Kimberly, is not described in breath-taking terms, she seems like someone to whom  the vast majority of us can relate. She becomes more and more likable as the book progresses. Another really great thing about the book is the chance to find out what happens to Devlin and Megan, as well as his Aunt and Grandmother Duchy. There seem to be no wasted words or plots in this book, everything is tied together in neat packages in the end.  It is a delightful story and well worth reading, with plenty of dry humor.	2001-09-08

That is a difficult statement to make given the Malory series, and so many other utterly delightful novels. However, in this one, she lets her knowledge of history create a background for the characters. It is not just a love story, but a love story in context. The storyline is exceptional and riveting. A 20th Century woman is paired with a Viking through a cursed sword, and they are transported together between centuries, where each have different comfort levels. It makes for fascinating reading how he, her Viking, deals with modern conveniences (bathrooms, kitchen appliances, cars etc.), and how she must cope with attitudes and clothing and everything else devoid of any modernity. This book is filled with humor. It is different from her other books, because it makes one think about the consequences of going back and inadvertently altering history. It is probably best appreciated by those who enjoy thinking about the storyline or imagining that time travel were possible. Or even better, that her Viking could materialize!	2001-09-08

It is utterly charming, but the best part of it is the &quot;update&quot; of the current day family and their broods of children. It is almost impossible to dislike any member of this amazing family, and enjoyable to read about them. Read the other books first and save this as the icing on the cake. Then do as I did, search the Web, looking to see, if perchance, mysteriously, another Malory novel remains to be read...maybe one was published I missed? :))	2001-08-30

She is irresistible except perhaps to the man she is determined to marry. This is one of those page-turning stories that you cannot put down, made even more lively by the roles played by her delightful uncles, Tony and James.

She brings the family into the storyline of the main characters and makes them part and parcel of its happy resolution, something she does again in the last book so far of the series, The Present. The book's love scenes are different from those of other Malory novels, a lot less wildly passionate, and a lot more tender. That is not to say there isn't plenty of passion, but it is more restrained, and in keeping with the characters. After all, Derek is not Anthony or James! But in its own way, this is a wonderful story, highly recommended.	2001-08-30

Suddenly as you sadly finish the last line of the book, you realize you must return to reality and wonder what happened to several hours that have magically vanished out of your life while engrossed in this utterly delightful novel. Each character is well drawn and likeable and the story is gripping. This must be one of her most succesful heroines.

Every other page she uses the same adjectives to describe her key characters. She creates a great storyline and then makes it tedious by the non-stop arguing between the characters.  Give me a break! You almost want to throttle the heroine to shut up, as does one of the highway men, who thought initially he fancied her too. Another tedious distraction is the converstaion her heroine keeps having with her conscience.  It adds nothing to the book and is annoying. I very much enjoy Ms. Lindsey's books in general and hope to read all of them.  This, however, was not one of my favorites.	2001-08-19
