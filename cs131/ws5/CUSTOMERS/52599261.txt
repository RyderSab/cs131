US	52599261	R31CHKJWY05GC6	188703806X	952259818	Blood Memories	Books	5	33	37	N	Y	Glittering Tapestry Tale	I started with 'Dhampir' and then had to get anything else Barb Hendee wrote.  Im only sorry that there are only two books so far.  A bit different then your average vampire tale.  These are neither the good vampires, nor the naughty vampires.  Perhaps the lost vampire might become a new genre.  In Dhampire we play the human side, mostly.  Or at least, mostly human. But a glimpse of the undead there reveals a great variation in vampires and the sides are drawn not between good and evil but simply for survival.  In this book we go full scale on the vampire side, through the eyes of vampires who are yet ignorant of themselves and what they are.  While in some books one becomes somewhat emeshed with the characters, Barb Hendee has the ability to bring you totally codenpendent on them.   As with some authors, BH can use detail and description to bring the characters and their emotions alive without distracting the reader.  In this case  I was not just disapointed when the book ended, but actually rather annoyed.    It's only in the hope of more books that I can recommend these	2003-04-03
US	52599261	R3EIN7KFKMQYVE	0765300346	214429954	War for the Oaks: A Novel	Books	5	6	12	N	Y	At last, a reprint!	I can not highly recomend this book enough, assuming you like 'urban fairie'.  It's funny and sweet and sad and pulls you in.  Its hard to put into words, and there are many other reviews that describe more.  Vaguely it has some similarities to DeLints urban fairie but with more humor.  Yet its a serious book, not a comedy.  I do love a book where the lead female a has a good case of 'smartmouth'.   But for while it was out of print, the average price on the used market was [$$good}!   And that is for a plain ordinary unremarkable book in no more then average condition.  Is THAT a clue? It took me two years before something came up for less, and thats using some special internet firms that search THOUSANDS of books sellers lists and notifiy you when there are matches.   Im not sure why Emma Bull is rather unknown,  but her style is unique.   This is the lightest of her books,  many of them are deeper, so perhaps not everyone enjoys reading them.  THIS book though is as close to 'universally popular' as I think something can get,(except for evanovich's  mysteries).   If i tried to describe the wardrobe thing I think it would detract, but I can say that I never looking at picking my clothes without a giggle  now.  And I notice that books that DONT describe what people are wearing gets a down from me. I did notice that Charlene Harris (?) of the southern vampire series does this very well too!   But someone else might make it tedious.    its the WAY she does it, not what she does.	2003-02-23

The books are; 1996-Death in Bloodhound Red, 1997-The House on Bloodhound Lane,  1998- A Brace of Bloodhounds, 1999-Blind Bloodhound Justice, 2000-Ten Little Bloodhounds.   I'm not sure why we don't have books for 2001 and 2002, but after you read the first book and then run out and buy the next four that continue without dropping the pace and excitement, you'll mourn the gap in the series.   Especially using the recommendations, its not that infrequent I get a new author 'can't put me down'er.   However this was one of those I read through as fast as I can because of the tension and mystery, and then start right over again to read for the wealth of information and the beauty of the text.  <br />I can't think of anything this book doesn't have.  There is a strong female protaganist, and one that hard to work her way from the ground up as well (as I did) that I really appreciate.  As a now breeder and trainer of bloodhounds, Jo Beth is a complex character with sometimes warring qualitis, but one that acts consistently within the defined pesonality.  The tension with the maniacal ex husband catches you quickly,  but the mystery picks up and holds you as you go on.   Additionally  I love a book that provides some other new knowlege and this book is rife with knowlege about 'The South',  the Okenofree swamp, and Bloodhounds.  I've checked some of what I learned here with a friend who has been in the swamp and the South and it's been checking out.  As an animal lover as well, you really get to love the bloodhounds and the knowlege of scent tracking and bloodhounds in particular is wide and varied.  <br />Yet Virginia Lanier sneaks the information in without any long boring solioquies.   She always manages to get the right amount in to help you appreciate the story and does it in a way that goes with the story, like say explaining something to a new person,   and then drives back to the plot before you could get bored.   And she makes it fascinating.   As I said earlier I was interested enough to talk to people till I found one that had been in the okenofee swamp, and I've got bloodhound research on my list of things to look into as well.  As far as the south in concerned,  I feel she does a good job of showing the pros and cons,  the beauty and surface graciousness on the surface, and the misogeny and the racism underneath.	2003-02-03
US	52599261	R3FJ41FHKWY55I	0061010871	533875529	A Brace of Bloodhounds (Jo Beth Sidden, No. 3)	Books	5	3	6	N	Y	Third in series of a gripping mystery	This is *NOTE* the third book of a series.  It is well done enough that you can pick up the series here but it will be more enjoyable if you start from the beginning.   The books are; 1996-Death in Bloodhound Red, 1997-The House on Bloodhound Lane,  1998- A Brace of Bloodhounds, 1999-Blind Bloodhound Justice, 2000-Ten Little Bloodhounds.   I'm not sure why we don't have books for 2001 and 2002, but after you read the first book and then run out and buy the next four that continue without dropping the pace and excitement, you'll mourn the gap in the series.   I have a review in on the first book that gives you an idea about the series, which I won't repeat the basics.  <br />It took the first two books to teach me to REALLY not start them on a work night because no matter how hard I try I am NOT going to sleep until its done and it's hard to debug unix on four hours sleep.  This time I managed to wait till friday night to read it, and did i mention  these are a healthy sized book, the kind a serious reader who reads very fast needs.   A thin or medium sized book I can read in a couple hours and is more like an appetizer to me, and you'll see me always score short story collections as 4 or less because there just isnt time to do a 5 story in one.   While not a thick as 'Dune', all her books are a serious read and very satisfying to the mature bookaholic with a substantial habit going.  Speaking of addiction, this is not the first  but one of the cream of crop of books that makes me sigh that I can only read a few thousand words an hour , I scored six hundred with 100% retention in high school, 30 years ago and am several orders of magnitude faster now though I don't know exactly HOW fast.   This kind of book makes you regret you cant IV it directly into your veins!   <br />The reason I call this a 'friday night only' book is that she achieves the kind of realism where the idea of having to get up in three hours for ten or twelves hours of work, even vigourous brainwork,  is a vague and unimportant concept once you start reading.   Virginnia Lanier's books are filled with such a wealth of information   and such an interweaving of the elements that after reading 1, then 1 again,  then a pause before I found 2, and read 1 and 2,  then 2 again,  that it was only a few weeks before I found 3, and then read 1, 2 and 3!   And im VERY ADHD so I get bored easily, but not with these books.  Like only a few authors Virginnia Lanier manages to hold onto several themes at the same time (like life) and weave them in together so well that anytime you hit a low point at one you hit a high point elsewhere and the book never lets you go without being artificially extravagent,   which never works for me.  The story has to hold together well for  things to happen within the realm of possibility of the definition of the characters and the environment and these stories definitely do that.<br />The main theme of this book is a murder.   But what makes this a different murder mystery?  One reoccurring theme that comes up is here is a mystery that has clear warning signs come up that a SMART woman would back off.   However while Jo Beth is smart, she is both stubborn and ruthless in her way.  There is just a point where she don't give a rat's behind and goes on anyway cause it's RIGHT, which is why I **LIKE*** the character.  And no matter how compelling the story is otherwise I can't stand reading a story about someone I can't stand.  Well, unless they are in a serious hailstorm of.. you know.   But even then they can't be the main character or I just won't want to bother reading it.  I know enough of THEM in real life.  <br />So anyway, this book the main theme is a murder, but there are many others and skillfully woven in.  Like life, nothing else waits while you work on your biggest priority.  The lightning just keeps coming.   And sometimes Jo Beth has to bail her boat pretty hard in the rain, which makes me like her and the series MORE.  I've hadto do some serious bailing myself, more often then not in fact I've been bailing out more then one leak and so does Jo Beth.  I like Jo Beth because she has made herself a sucess AGAINST all odds,  not because things just worked out her way easy.  Also because she is smartmouthed ... tough broad that is willing to take the consequences of speaking her piece, even if they can be fairly serious.  <br />Of course by the strict definition of success a lot of people would not think she is a sucess, she works dang hard,  long hours and doesnt have fast cars or serious jewelry (funny, like me).  She does have a house (at the edge of a swamp) but then she did have an inheritance I didn't. <wink>  But Jo Beth has none of the icons of success in the current world, most especially a husband.  To a lot of the world she is just more white trash.   But **I** think she is a success and that is all the thinking that **I** care about even if I am just 'more shanty Irish'.  And if Jo Beth and I both  blew some chances because we just had to tell someone where to go, sure but we're still laughing at the look on his or her face years later, not crying cause I'm 'trapped' in my nice house and wasn't 'allowed to be myself'.  Which is actually something Jo Beth had and walked away from.  I never had it so I don't know if I'd meet the test and give it up, but then Jo Beth is fiction and I STILL really LIKE her.   I don't know what kind of background Ms Lanier has, but she sure created a tough gal that this 'worked her way up alone from minimum wage' reader can appreciate without rolling her eyes at the lack of realism.	2003-02-03

It is well done enough that you can pick up the series here but it will be more enjoyable if you start from the beginning.   The books are; 1996-Death in Bloodhound Red, 1997-The House on Bloodhound Lane,  1998- A Brace of Bloodhounds, 1999-Blind Bloodhound Justice, 2000-Ten Little Bloodhounds.   I'm not sure why we don't have books for 2001 and 2002, but after you read the first book and then run out and buy the next four that continue without dropping the pace and excitement, you'll mourn the gap in the series.   I have a review in on the first book that gives you an idea about the series, which I won't repeat.  <br />In this second book Virginia Lanier develops the themes she began in the first book.   As I mentioned she does an excellent job of giving you a wealth of knowlege about the south, the Okenofee swamp,  and bloodhounds as trackers (not hunters).   You learn still more and critically important, she manages to repeat some of the old knowlege such that you don't lose vital bits if you start at the second book, but is still interesting if you read the first one.  Instead of boring solliques you get inserts that go with the action that end before you get bored,  such as when she is explaining something to someone as opposed to an off the story line that reminds you that you are reading a book.   As with the first book, I not only read it till it was done (about 3am on a night I had to get up and go to work at 7am)  even though I swore to myself that really truely I was not going to do this like I did with the first one. Then once I read it through I went back and enjoyed a leisury read to pick up the information and the beauty of the story, after I happily reread the first book for the third time.<br />I've checked out a lot of the information here with a friend that is from Georgia and so far she is 100% on accuracy.   Since just because an author makes something sound believable doesnt mean it is, and I'm primary a science fiction reader so I'm always wary.  The only difference is my friend knows bloodhound hunting dogs,  but no trackers.  But she did verify (and I can't remember which book it was in) where a monster gator was climbing a fence to get at the puppies,  that while she doesn't know of any examples of them climbing fences, there are many examples of them getting into fenced yards where no one can figure out how they got in.  <br />Additionally in this book the long feared release of her ex-husband from prison happens, and I really enjoyed Jo Beth's revenge on the prison system for not telling her BEFORE.  I'm not going to say what happens or if she found out 'in time'  because I HATE a review that blows the plot by telling you the entire book like a bookreport.   I'm going to let you wonder.	2003-02-03

You are likely to enjoy this book if you like either or both.   But this book isn't quite as funny as Evanovitch, for whom a new star score should be made and which I describe as 'pants wetting funny.' Sookie never arrests anyone in a feathered chicken suit with a mustard gun, but it certainly does have some of the endearing quality of the 'how did I get into this'  of Stephanie Plum.  It doesn't have the depths of scary horror of Linda Hamilton, which can be a plus if you can't handle major horror.  Although it is a very funny book with amusing episodes as well as mystery and romance, it is hard to pin down how it comes about.  Some of it is just Sookie's matter of fact attitude in the face of the bizzareness that surrounds her life after ending up with a vampire boyfriend.  It is crazy to someone else, but the author is able to show how from Sookie's point of view with her disability of being forced to hear human minds, that in fact, its simply logical.  And that I think is some of the charm of the book (and its sequal, Dead in Dallas)  where you see-saw between your viewpoint and Sookie's and the author is very good at reminding you why it does make sense to Sookie without being boring about it.  Bill her vampire boyfriend remains a mystery as well as he is the one mind she can't read.  He SEEMS to care for her, but its the reverse of many 'romantic' books where you know the other side, here the boyfriend is the one mind you never really know of.  Another thing I particularily like is attention to the characteristics of the secondary characters and happily, you see many of them in the sequel.   But mostly you get to know and like Sookie more as time goes on, though 'only' a barmaid she is a gold star winner at good hearted spunky, down to earth practicality and how to make the best of a bad lot.  And unlike either Stephanie Plum or Anita Blake, Sookie and Bill arealways TRYING to stay OUT of trouble.  So you have chuckles when over and over, they end up 'dead' in it again.   The mystery in it more then dilutes the romantic angle for those of us bored by 'straight romance' readers.  This is a rare four way crossover of mystery, horror, romance, and comedy.	2003-01-23
US	52599261	R2ULZ0YG8SX89Y	0684196395	830758196	One for the Money (Stephanie Plum, No. 1) (Stephanie Plum Novels)	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	Should be a six star comedy	This is the only series for which a new six star catagory ought to be made which I normally describe as 'pants wetting funny'.  I found this, the first of the series,  from amazon browze, and thought I'd be getting another tough gal private eye, coroner, detective, etc.  It's helpful if you just consider sugarplums to be a christmas special.  In this first book you are introduced to ex lingerie buyer Stephanie Plum  and the first of her cars, and many lovable secondary characters.  As soon as I saw she was an unemployed lingerie buyer I almost quit, but the hysterical dinner with her family won me over.   Stephanie stumbles into a job as a bounty hunger because the filing job with her cousin is taken and slogs through the adventures with a combination of guts, luck, and a scary lack of reality about how underskilled she is for the job which comes naturally to the girl who once tried to fly off the garage roof.  I expected to her to toughen up as the series continued, but with a sneak peek I'll admit that by book eight she is still scared of guns if much more used to exploding cars and finding people waiting in her living room who picked her lock.  The book and series would be totally unrealistic if Stephanie wasn't sel admittedly 'lucky' rather then skilled. Her relatives on the police force and her home grown knowlege of the 'Mafia retirement community' in New Jersey with its net of families and friends makes her survival more plausible.  Delightfully nearly all the wonderful secondary characters grace the sequels  (including her hamster), something I really enjoy.  It's a good crossover of romance, comedy and mystery for those of us that like our books varied.  The sicker your sense of humor, the funnier this book is.  Titled numerically I don't have to include a sequel chronology here, except that 'visions of sugar plums' (a christmas special) comes between eight and the soon to be published 'nine'.	2003-01-23

Putting together two small books in one convienent cover, this is actually the one I've wished the most for a sequel to. It's a lighter introduction to Lint's world of urban fairie when two young women find themselves catapulted into the fae world without warning.  Read it, enjoy it, and then try Moonheart and Greenmantle before you give up and buy all the rest of his books.  The only of Lint's books I haven't loved is the short story collections, and only because I find short stories frustratingly well, short.	2003-01-23

'but he loves me in some way'  being as true as 'and death is too good for him'  can be a difficult concept for those of us raised to be victims of love.  'that he loves me in some way'  and 2.50 will get you a cup of coffee anywhere.    this would be a good book to read for anyone that has been in an abusive releationship as a child or adult.	2003-01-23

However I really enjoyed this book!   The plot was interesting, the end was unguessable (could have gone easily more then one way) the main two 'heros' (hahaha) had complex but explicable personalities that get you hooked to find out more.  Also the 'ememies'  were well thought out and described with different personalities and motivations. Of prime interest, the characters reacted within their defined characteristics and motivations,  but not TOO predicatably.  Something in the style reminds me of Barbara Hambly who regularily produces 'can't put me downers'.   I'm hoping for more books in the series and for more series as well!	2003-01-22

Although the titles of this series sound like the shaman is going to be the main protagonist,  it doesn't work that way.  There is a very humorous interaction between Charlie Moon, of the Tribal Police,  who doesn't believe in magic, and his Grandmother who pretends she doesn't when around the priest but who sneaks out to confer with the  local landspirit, a type of dwarf.  The mystery is well thought out and kept interesting by the complex (but not TOO complex)  characters.  Of great importantce to me is that the characters also act within their characterization and motivations.  This is a particular joy in this book where Charlie and his Grandmother are often working at cross purposes motive wize and a delightful weave of information back and forth as you move towards the ending.    The grandmother in particular is sort of a ute 'maxine'  with never a good word to say and a hillarious lineup of grumbles and mumbled complaints.	2003-01-22

Angel with a Sword is written by Cherryth alone, and has nonumber on the cover.  Festival Moon is the first anthology, and islabeled #1 on the spine of the book. And I'm sure because I'm staring right at the book and just re-read both books this weekend.  Angel With a Sword definitely preceeds Festival Moon. <br />Staring with Angel with a Sword, you get your introduction to the space/medieval world of Merovin, though the whole series takes place in one city, Merovingen. It is a Venice-like city of canals and corruption both, with Borgia like clans plotting against each other.  <br />Medeival/space worlds are fun, and there is no world builder like Cherryth.  The mix in this world is due to a human colony being bombed back to, if not the stone age, to barely industrial civilization after the planet must by treaty be handed over to the alien sharrh.  Who don't do anything else (up to now) and leave the survivors to fragment and interestingly enough, decide that if they don't develop technology they will be left alone. <br />That may be true or not, but one of the most amusing parts to me is the religions that spring up over the whole issues of 1) how do we explain what happened and why we are here 2) how to control the masses.  It is an analogy not difficult to draw back to Earth and provide a good spoof on the whole organized religion wagon. The only exception in the religious main triad of adventist, revantist, and janist, is that the janists (followers of jane morgoth) wish to bring BACK technology, though out of caution to do so subtly.  <br />No relationships in the book are simple, with tension and confusion being entertainments standards with Cherryth and a guarentee of fun reading for other bookaholics, I mean, highly motivated readers.  Well perhaps the attraction that Altair Jones has in the beginning for Tom Mondrogan is the only easily understandable one. Street girl of seventeen, tough andhard shelled, but long overdue in a medeival society for a 'intimate relationship' when tossed nearly into her canal boat is handsome, mysterious, Tom Mondragon.  But the scrapes and plots they get into are anything but simple, and the book will keep you turning pages. <br />I also have to say that the anthology is so well done, and so well edited, that I am not really cognizant while reading of the fact that I am switching authors as I go.  This was far MORE apparent in the Thieve's World anthology, so if you were put off there, you may enter the Merovingen world without fear.  END	2000-04-11

As is appropriate, she was far too  young in the first book, 'The Betrayl'.  It would be difficult to get the full scope of  this book without reading the first one but better than not reading it at  all.  Book Two carries you between the whole political world and the  reasons behind the creation of Ari Emory, to the formitive years of Ari  herself.  If you couldn't get book three EITHER, it would really be a  waste, because this is definitely a bridge-book.  Priceless though, for it  is by following Ari's developement in book two that we understand the  powerful character created in book three.  And secondly, it brings through  the eyes of a growing child the world that is Cyteen, where all that seems  strange to us is assimilated as merely part of her world.  It is a  refreshing way to consume the reality of a new universe the Cherryth does  so well.  For not only does Cherryth bring to life new worlds with an  intricate detail that leads one to question if Cherryth has actually  traveled there, and not written them, but winds them around deep characters  and convuluted plots that keep even the most jaded readers of science  fiction spellbound.	2000-04-05

A lesser author would lose  you with the complexity of the characters and the plot and the world, but  Cherryth just manages to capture your mind, suck it into the book, and hold  it hostage until the thing is done. WARNING, do not start reading this book  before a work day.  Or, any of Cherryth's.  Start on friday night, so that  you will have plenty of time or you might end up in a lot of trouble.   By  the end of this book, you will want to re-read all the alliance books just  to reexperience the saga now that Union has been made real to you. <br />As a  public service announcement, the other books loosely in the order written  is 'Merchenter's Luck', 'DownBelow Station', 'Forty Thousand in Gehenna',  'RimRunner', and 'Tripoint'.	2000-04-05

Coming out of a vacumn that was only  slightly touched by 'Forty Thousand in Gehenna'  the Cyteen books suddenly  brought to life an all too human Union, that has found a different way to  survival in the stars.        <br />In the betrayal, Ariane Emory's planned  clone is brought to life after the assasination of the brilliant but  somewhat twisted scientist that had a major part in the eugenics that keeps  Union alive.   The small Ari is but a minor character in this book,  featuring Justin Warrick and his 'brother' the clone Grant. More  interestingly, Justin Warrick suffered at the hands of Ariane Emory and you  see his own struggle not to let the past poison his life, the child, or the  suspicions of others destroy his own too fragile family.  <br />It is a fast  change from 'Union the Evil Ghost' to a fast dip into the world of Cyteen  and a feeling of kinship with the beleagured people that struggle for  survival there. A world not of evil, but like others, a mixture of people  trying to survive.  Better, this book was rapidly sequaled by parts 2 and  3, the rebirth, and the vindication.	2000-04-05

Man, demon, fetch, you don't know, and the whole story takes you on a trip where you can not  preguess the plot or the ending.   The only problem with this book is that  it is very much a lead in to the next book. Fortunately Lyn Abbey wrote the  sequel 'Under the Web' instead of leaving us hanging.  My big regret is  that there isn't a whole series of these books. Lyn Abbey has a tendency to  create a fascinating new world, write a book or two, and then drop it.  On  the other hand, Lyn Abbey's books never seem to accumulate the fame that  they deserve, so perhaps somewhere there IS a third book, waiting to be  published.	2000-04-05

In the world patiently crafted Lyn Abbey lets her characters lose to solve the mystery of 'Dart' and wether he is man, demon, fetch, or who knows what.  Berika the sheperdess came off relatively  poorly in the first book, still gaining her feet.   As she finds her power  that changes.  The obsessive reader of science fiction for some thirty five  years, I rarely find a book who's ending I can't guess, but Lyn Abbey makes  the whole thing a unique experience with her depth of detail and  characterization.  I only wish I could say of her that 'she doesn't know  when to end a series', as two books seems to be her limit.  A pity, because  the rich worlds she carves out have the potential for much more.  These two  books are worth finding.END	2000-04-05

If you simply want to copy things, the dover art series is the book for you.   If you wish to get into the details of the art enough to create fresh  designs or to 'straighten bent borders' and 'bend straight borders' or cut  things in half, this is the book for you.  After reading it I found that I  also noticed things in existing art that I had never looked for before.  Prior to reading this book I had tried to freehand modify certain designs,  and met with fairly, though I am a fair sketcher.  With this book I was  able to modify a design for my purposes, and then using a chalked grid,  draw it from scratch on leather, to use in quillworking.	2000-03-31

A warning here,  these are fairly serious books for people that are truly caught by the art of the Celts and wish to know  more about it. These are not clip art books nor stencils.  Meehan  does a beautiful job of joining historical information and the  construction. In reading books  you know that he loves this subject.  His  books are full of tantalizing hints into another world that throws around  terms like 'the Waldalgesheim pattern'. Which he does explain, but leaves  one with the desire to run out and find a book specific to that subject and  learn more.  Short of doing what I suspect might be doctoral work on the  subject, reading Meehan's books are the way to go.  He also has a useful  appendix of terms in the back.  My favorites in this book however are  the discussion on the triskele, the triple sprial patterns, which are not  considered knotwork per se, and are therefore not to be found in the  standard books on knotwork.  This book also covers some of the more  freeform curving designs that do not come under the knotwork category.  Well worth the read.	2000-03-31

In fact one of its best points is the same reason I penalize it a star, is the intricacy of the designs.       The intricacy is also wonderful, since most stencils tend to give up detail in order to make the  stencil simpler to make.  The problem here is that you have to cut the  stencils out yourself.  Now because of the very intricacy, there are a LOT  of tiny holes you have to cut out.      By the time you get done, or at  least by the time I get done, the paper is not quite so sturdy as it was.   And it took quite some time to do. I recomend a sharp pair of small  embroidery scissors to do it.	2000-03-31

Much of the art of the Gaels and the Norse is similar, due to both a common origin, proximity, raiding, and trading.  I've had books on  Viking art, harder to find than Celtic, and many on Celtic. But although  there was great similarity in the designs, (and also resembles much of the  Scythian art which brings us to anthropological discussions)  I found  nothing to discuss the differences until I found this book.       As I  discussed in 'Spiral Patterns' by Meehan, his books are delightful sources  for the serious interest.  He has a way of combining a historical  study  with the construction of the art that is simply delightful.       My  favorite in this book is the whimsical 'gripping beast' discussion.   Otherwise, though it is hard to describe exactly how, by the end of the  book I was not only exposed to a number of Viking designs that I had never  seen before, but now able to tell the difference at a glance between the  two art forms.  The Viking form is less restrained than the Celtic art that  reached its height in dreary volumes, the designs such as 'the early viking  style' shown have a energetic and powerful energy then the overly tame  knotwork.   In addition there ARE some examples worth using as clip art,  but the main point of the book is serious information as to the history and  the meaning of the designs, which other books simply show.	2000-03-31

Okay, it has a really good variety of borders as well.  Both  the bounded kind, and in the back some free line designs. they even provide  a nice celtic alphabet in the back for use.  But the non-xeroxing blue  layhout lines means that you are going to get things really centered on the  page before copying. This is a big plus in my book.  I only give it four  stars because page borders just dont thrill me enough for five stars. Maybe  if they were in color..	2000-03-31

If you have, you probably own several, and already know to get this book.  You may even have some and not realize it, many examples of her  work are sold at Celtic fairs.   The designs in the book are clear and  good, can be used (with a little work with scizzors, transfer pencils and  plastic sheets) for either stencil, embroidery, a background for the  paint-on stained glass decals, or scanned in for any purpose you would  like. <br />It's definitely a book to buy if you are building your celtic  crafts collection.	2000-03-30

Any celtic art book of hers is worth buying, even sight unseen. <br />I actually bought the book hoping for  borders for clothing design, but it is more set for paper/book type  borders.  I'm giving it five stars anyway, because for what it is meant for  it is not only fantastic, but the only book of its sort I've seen  available, after years of scrounging at Celtic fairs.<br />As usuall with  Courtney's work, the designs are beautiful and well chosen giving a well  rounded variety of possible designs to choose from.	2000-03-30
