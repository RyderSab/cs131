Mr. Pressfield introduces the concept of \\"Resistance\\" to be that voice in our head that always holds us back from doing the things that would take us to the next level in our life.<br /><br />Part 2 goes through how to overcome \\"resistance\\" and take that next step.  A lot of the advice in this section is good but has been stated before.  I also would have liked some practical applications like what to do to help overcome fear.<br /><br />Part 3 talks about living a life that has put fear in check.  This section was my least favorite of the 3 but it still had some good advice such as how to determine if what you are doing is your real calling.<br /><br />Overall, this is an easy read with a lot of good advice.  I would recommend it to anyone looking to overcome their fears and do what they know has to be done.  4 out 5 stars.	2005-10-09
US	48157598	R37GTUT8DNAZFQ	0310247454	340262262	Boundaries: When to Say Yes, How to Say No to Take Control of Your Life	Books	5	6	8	N	N	A great book about learning to say "no"	\\"Boundaries\\" is a great book about learning to say to \\"no\\" to people.  I am definitely a person who has trouble saying \\"no\\" at times so this book was a welcome read for me.<br /><br />The book starts by explaining the need for boundaries.  Essentially the jist of the book is you are responsible for yourself and no one else.  Therefore you must take control of your life and your decisions.<br /><br />This amounts to defining what your responsibility is and what is acceptable for you.  Then you need to communicate to other people what is and isn't acceptable and then hold to your ground.  Quite often this surprises others who are not used to this.  People even begin telling you that you are being unreasonable or too harsh.<br /><br />This book also tends to focus more on \\"tough love\\".  The book suggests that if someone is doing something that is unacceptable, you should set out the consequences of the decision, place the decision in the hands of the person, and then stick to your guns.  For example, if your spouse is always running late, tell them that if they are late, you are going to leave without them.  Then stick to you guns.  The authors belive that after a few times of being left behind, they will change their behavior.<br /><br />I didn't find too many negatives about this book.  Some of the reading is a little dry.  I would have liked to see a little more organization to the book and a few more examples.<br /><br />Regardless, \\"Boundaries\\" is a great book to read.  If you are looking to take back control of your life and learn when to say \\"no\\" to others, this is the book for you.  5 out of 5 stars.	2005-09-24

I was highly excited to read this book as most books don't take your personality type into consideration.<br /><br />First off, you will probably get a lot more out of this book if you have already determined your Myers-Briggs personality type.  The beginning of the book does try to help you determine your type, but it is mostly just picking one type over another when the actually score is really based on a continuum.<br /><br />After determining your time, the book has a chapter for each personality type.  Since you only have one personality type, you only need to read one of the 16 chapters.<br /><br />The chapter written specifically for your type was just ok.  The chapter was filled with examples of people who are that type.  I just wanted to read about how my personality type applies to the job situation, not read example about my type. Eventually the chapter did get to what jobs would work best for you and things you should keep in mind when selecting a job.  However, I was hopeing for a more in-depth explanation and analysis.<br /><br />While the book does an excellent job of focusing on your personality type, it does next to nothing to help you with determining your interests, passions and goals, all of which are vital to picking the correct job.<br /><br />So... if you know your Myers-Briggs type, which you should before you read this book, you only really need to read 10-15 pages out of this book.  If you are really stuck on what job you are best suited for, pick this book up or just skim it in the bookstore.  3 out of 5 stars.	2005-09-24

We have all had to deal with person that flies into a rage, tries to use unscrupulous tactics to get their way, or is just plain difficult.<br /><br />Shapiro and Jankowski present the material in an excellent fashion.  Each topic they bring up is followed by an example situation that they have experienced and how the technique they used broke down the techniques of the difficult person.  They also give instructions to identify what type of difficult person you are dealing with as well as a step by step formula to put you back in control of the situation.<br /><br />The only negative thing I have to say about this book is that the techniques are easier said than done.  The first and most important step for dealing with negative people is learning to control your emotions which is hard to do when you are being yelled at or taken advantage of.<br /><br />I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn to deal difficult people.  It's easy to read, easy to remember, and gives lots of examples.  5 out of 5 stars.	2005-09-12

Ferrazzi starts off by stating you really need to begin by finding your own passion and mission.  Additionally, to build strong relationships you need to ask, \\"What can I offer?\\" rather than \\"What can I get?\\"<br /><br />Ferrazzi has an excellent writing style that is easy to understand and read.  He gives some great suggestions regarding how to \\"ping\\" casual contacts and keeping in touch with people.  Ferrazzi is a \\"follow up\\" maniac as he states you should continually follow up with people even if you don't hear back from them.  I guess that depends on your viewpoint.<br /><br />There isn't much to like about this book.  I would highly recommend it for anyone looking to be able to develop their relationships.  5 out of 5 stars.	2005-09-10

Richard Duncan states the current American trade deficit has caused a worldwide credit bubble which will pop and when it does, we can look forward to a global recession as well as deflation.<br /><br />I picked this book up because Robert Kiyosaki recommended it.  The book certainly reads like an economics textbook so be sure to have a economics dictionary close-by if you aren't an economics major.<br /><br />This book is filled with lots of data and graphs, although Mr. Duncan tends to repeat himself. His interpretations of the data seem to be logical although he takes the stance that the worse case situation will happen.  Mr. Duncan also has an interesting hypothesis regarding how the Fed seems to have lost control of interest rates.<br /><br />While you may agree or disagree with Mr. Duncan, this book is a must read for anyone wanting to look at where we may be going economically in the future.  4 out of 5 stars.	2005-08-23

The first part of the book makes the case for execution in a company, while part 2 looks at how to create a culture of execution, and finally part 3 looks at the 3 processes vital to an \\"execution\\" culture.<br /><br />I found this book to be written at a high level, targeted to CEOs and executive managers.  As a result, I couldn't understand a lot of what the authors were talking about.  However, I enjoyed the examples that they provided and wished they had provided more.<br /><br />I also would have like more diagrams and processes to use in order to create this culture.  Much of the book speaks of the author's experiences, but they don't do a good job of explaining the situation fully.  Unless you have been following these author's lives, this may be difficult for you too.<br /><br />In all, it's an average book.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  If you are a CEO or execution, you may want to skim through this book.  Otherwise, it probably won't hold your interest.  3 out of 5 stars.	2005-08-14

Books	3	14	15	N	N	Not what I expected....	\\"Your First Year In Network Marketing\\" is a book about surviving your first year in Network Marketing.  However, given the book's title, I expected this book to be a how-to guide about network marketing skills.  Not so... this book is all about the mistakes network marketers make.  Really the title should be, \\"What Not To Do In Network Marketing\\".<br /><br />I also did not enjoy the format of this book.  It's dimensions are too large and the column format is annoying.  Apparently the authors didn't read, \\"What Not To Do When Writing A Book\\".<br /><br />However the book still has some strong points.  The advice is logical and useful, even if it takes forever to get to it.  I really liked the summaries that they gave at the end of each chapter.  You would be better off ripping these out of the book and just reading those pages.<br /><br />If you are new to network marketing, this might be a good book for you.  Again, it mostly focuses on what not to do, so if you don't already know, you will be left thinking, \\"So what DO I do?\\"  3 out of 5 stars.	2005-08-08

After all... who doesn't want to be happier? And a book that was written in the 1950s and has sold 5 million copies should be a good read.<br /><br />I was surprised, but pleasantly surprised, at the level of spirituality in this book.  The entire book focuses on how you can use the power of Jesus Christ to transform your life and your thinking.  Norman Vincent Peale also goes through several other negative habits such as worry, overcoming sickness, optimism, and overcoming a broken heart.<br /><br />On the downside, this book is a bit repetitive.  What's the answer?  Look in the Bible!  I did like the lists he included at the end of some of his chapters, but I wish he would have spent more time on describing and explaining those instead!  Additionally as the book was written in the 1950s, some of the English is awkward, but is still readable and therefore effective.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"The Power of Positive Thinking\\".  However be warned of the Christianity present in it.  If something like that offends you, best to steer clear.  Otherwise... this is a must read.  4 out of 5 stars.	2005-07-19

However upon reading \\"Cracking The Millionaire Code\\", I was left thinking, \\"What did I get out of this book?\\"<br /><br />Essentially this book is about creating \\"Enlightened Wealth\\", or rather earning money to give it away to charities.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm all for philanthropy, but this book attempts to be both spiritual to all beliefs and be about wealth creation, and ends up doing neither.<br /><br />Robert Allen and Mark Hansen's universalism is dripping out of this book.  Plus they over utilize the \\"rely on the higher power\\" without really getting into how to go about it.  Again, not that I believe contacting a \\"higher power\\" for seeking wisdom and understanding.  However too much of this book is just repeating the statement, \\"Seek the higher power.\\"  Want a better marketing plan?  Seek the higher power.  Want to increase your sales?  Seek the higher power.<br /><br />There are a couple of good points in this book, but they are few and not worth the time and effort to search them out.<br /><br />If you offended but the \\"higher power\\" idea, steer clear of this book.  If you offended by \\"universalism\\", steer clear of this book.  If you don't want to waste your time, steer clear of this book.  2 out of 5 stars.	2005-07-11

Specifically, how to apply this question in areas of your life such as finances, time, purity, and family.<br /><br />I was impressed with Andy Stanley's insights.  His writing is very clear, concise, and easy to read.

Using strategies like using a organizer, figuring out what your goals and priorities are, and things like refusing to take coffee breaks are examples of what can be found in this book.<br /><br />The advice in this book is solid.  I especially liked the chapters on organizing your tasks by priority, developing excellent work habits, and overcoming procrastination.  The ideas presented are logical and beneficial to maintaining a highly productive lifestyle, while they remain practical and easy to implement.<br /><br />However I felt I had read this book before because many of the ideas presented in this book are repeated in his other books.  I found very little content in the book that was actually new.  I also thought the chapter \\"Time Management Techniques for Salespeople\\" didn't belong in this book.  That chapter should have been in a book directed to salespeople rather than a general audience, and which made me think it was just added for the sake of adding material.<br /><br />This book is a good read if you never have read Brian Tracy material before, or if you would like to review Brian Tracy's material again.

Plus Brian Tracy has a pretty good track record when it comes to workplace efficiency.<br /><br />However I must say I was not entirely impressed with this book.  The book has absolutely no flow to it.  And most of the material can be found in his other materials.  It's like he just cut and pasted the parts on goals into a new book.  As a result, the book tends to jump all over the place, often repeats information, and sometimes has unclear information (For example, you are supposed to write down your goals once a day, but later in the book it says you are supposed to write down your 1, 5, and 10 year goals.  Huh?  Is that something extra or am I supposed to do that with the daily goals?)<br /><br />Regardless of it's shortcomings, it does have good information.  The habits you are supposed to try and develop are solid, but just really unorganized.  There are a lot of questions at the end of each chapter to help you identify areas you need to work on and what you want.  I also really liked that he put a recommended reading section in the back of the book.<br /><br />If you are new to Brian Tracy, or if you want a review of his material, pick this book up.  Otherwise it's not really going to be worth your time.  3 out of 5 stars.	2005-06-17

Essentially it boils down to the fact that most small business owners are still \\"employees\\" at heart and don't understand their responsibilities as the business leader and manager.<br /><br />The ideas for overcoming this fatal flaw involve looking at your business as if you are creating a franchise.  To do this requires that you work \\"on your business\\" and not \\"in your business\\" by creating a \\"primary aim\\" along with detailed, organized systems for your organization.  The concepts seem to be solid and logical, but the book was just that.... concepts and no real meat.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen more specific examples in this book.  While there is a running story throughout the book, it merely reviews and restates the concepts that are introduced in the chapter.  I would have rather seen a brief overview of the important points of the chapter, and then an example that shows the specific steps of how to do each of the concepts the author talks about.<br /><br />Regardless of its shortcomings, \\"The E-Myth\\" is still a good book for entrepreneurs to read.

I was expecting a book on how to pick advisors like accountants, real estate brokerss, lawyers, etc.  However this book was about creating a team that works according to a \\"code of honor\\" that is created by the team.<br /><br />Essentially the code of honor is a set of rules that the team creates and lives by in order to maintain a high level of accountability and performance.  The idea makes sense as teams and people and general need rules by which to live by.  Author Blair Singer does a good job of organizing the information and presenting it in an easy to read fashion.<br /><br />On the downside, I wish there were more examples in this book to illistrate the points he's makes.  A list of rules would have been nice, or the lists of rules that some other companies have come up with.<br /><br />However other than that, the book is well done.

Robert Kiyosaki goes through the ideas that he believes the rich have about money.<br /><br />A lot of this book makes sense.  The advice that the rich use their money to buy assets rather than liabilities, and the rich become inside investors in order to reduce their risk in their investments, seems very logical.  However I felt quite unsatisfied throughout the book as it offers no real substance or examples.  A good example would be the book stresses the importance of having a financial plan, but gives no example of what a financial plan looks like!<br /><br />The depth of the information is also extremely thin.  The BI-triangle chapters are good ideas, but they offer no real advice about developing these systems.<br /><br />However about halfway through this book you realize that this book isn't supposed to give you information about investing, it's just trying to get you to think more about the ideas behind investing.  Basically the whole point of the book is to get you interested in learning about other investing activities.  But the book doesn't even help you out by suggesting where you should begin to start the learning process!<br /><br />So this book is good for expanding your mind if you are an employee or looking at starting your own business, but it's just a waste of time for the rest.  There are also several typos throughout the book making me wonder if perhaps more time shouldn't have been spent on this book.  3 out of 5 stars.	2005-05-20

My only beef with the book was that it's a little outdated and I found myself wanting more explaination of more current companies.

The questionnaires that are returned from these millionaires reveal that they in fact did not do fantastic in school, they don't spend excessively, they spend their time shopping for investments and getting investment advice, and they work excessively hard at a job that they love to do.<br /><br />\\"The Millionaire Mind\\" takes a very mathematical approach, just like \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\".  However I found \\"The Millionaire Mind\\" to be much more readable as Thomas Stanley does a better job of writing up the correlations and summaries.  The amount of data included with the book is quite impressive and very useful.<br /><br />I really enjoyed learning about how millionaires overcome their fears lead frugal lifestyles.  I was equally impressed by the spouse chapter which talked about what factors are important in spouses.  Plus the overall theme of the book was that millionaires work very hard at their job, but they absolutely love their job.<br /><br />Despite being a great book, I found Stanley to be very repetitive.  I really thought this 400 page book could have easily been 300 pages if you cut out of the repetition.  Additionally I would have liked a glossary of definitions in the back of the book as some of the statistical jargon can be confusing at times.<br /><br />Overall, the book is fantastic.

Unlike what most people think, the people who have the biggest houses, drive the fanciest cars, wear the most expensive clothes are in fact not millionaires and are also not wealthy.<br /><br />Stanley and Danko observe what characteristics make up a wealthy person and why the people who we think are wealthy are in fact not wealthy.  Mostly it boiled down to wealthy people are frugal and are more entrepreneurial than the upper class doctors, lawyers and executives.  The people who look wealthy but in fact are not spend far too much of their money on consumer items to give the \\"look\\" of being wealthy, as opposed to investments.<br /><br />My biggest beef with this book was it read like a specialized statistics textbook.  They have packed a lot of statistics into this book, some useful, some not useful at all.  That makes reading this book rather tedious at times.  It also felt like the authors were drawing out some of the points longer than they needed to be.  Being shorter and more concise potentially could have made this book easier to read.<br /><br />Regardless, this book contains some excellent information that everyone should know about.  If you are looking into increasing your wealth, you can't go wrong with this book.  4 out of 5 stars.	2005-05-06

It's more of a book that just states some common sense ideas.  While there certainly is some merit to the ideas, none of them are really new and most of them are things that work for him, but not necessarily for other people.<br /><br />I enjoyed the parts of the book where he talks about what he goes through in a typical day, and the types of habits he keeps.  Reading about the type of material he reads and how much time he spends on learning was very interesting for me.<br /><br />However, Mr. Trump doesn't get into a lot of details.  Some of his advice (Find the right assistant, Be patient) was just plain simple.  He would have been better off explaining how to implement these ideas or how one could gain insight into this advice.<br /><br />That said, if you want to learn more about Mr. Trump, this would be a good book for you.  But if you are just looking for specific advice about how to get rich, look somewhere else.  3 out of 5 stars.	2005-05-04

He gives some interesting insights into his life, such as sleeping only 4 hours a day, reading over 3 hours a day, and some real estate advice.<br /><br />This book is certainly written in \\"to-the-point\\" fashion\\". And in some cases, too much so.  Some of his advice just plain stinks.  Advice like, \\"be sure to hire the right contractor/lawyer/banker\\" but then fails to explain how one goes about determining this.<br /><br />However, he also goes through what a typical week in the life of Trump is like, which I found to be quite interesting.  Just to see the amount of work he gets done in a short period of time was quite fascinating.<br /><br />So purchase this book if you are interested in the life of Mr. Trump, but don't expect any ideas that you probably haven't heard before.  3 out of 5 stars.	2005-05-03

The book covers a wide range of topics from idea conception, to choosing a business structure, obtaining financing, performing market research, buying equipment, basic accounting, etc.  This book covers almost every topic related to starting a business.<br /><br />That being said, the book doesn't go into great detail on most of the topics, it merely introduces each aspect and explains the most important parts.  However this book is quite incomplete without additional information.<br /><br />Regardless this book has some great information in an easy to read format.  The book includes some great web sites that give more information on particular topics but I wish that the author would have included more book recommendations.<br /><br />If you are thinking about owning your own business, this book is for you.  But if you already own a business, this may be too elementary for you.  But if not, I highly recommend this book.  5 out of 5 stars.	2005-05-01

I was also impressed with the step-by-step scenario they had of the negotiation with the landlord that had charged over the rent control limit.<br /><br />On the down side, I really wished there were more examples in this book.  While there certainly were a few, I was left wanting more in order to understand the techniques given.  Also I found some of the language to be dry, but this is not a huge issue.<br /><br />Getting to Yes is definitely a book you want to read and we all have to negotiate at some point in our lives.  4 out of 5 stars.	2005-04-17

The topic of finding one's purpose is a hot topic these days and Feinberg attempts to tackle the topic as well.<br /><br />The book goes through some of the issues that arise and Feinberg lets us in on a couple challenges she faced while finding her purpose.  Through the book, some good advice is given (do what you love, trust God, etc) but nothing I haven't heard before.  The best part of the book probably was when Feinberg talked about needing to get your validation from God, and not from the world.  While this makes sense, I felt the practical application was not covered as well as it should have been, as trusting God is much easier said than done.  Most people don't need to be told what to do... they need to be told how to do it, and then be given examples of what other people did.  And while Feinberg does give some examples from other people, I was left unfulfilled.<br /><br />I was impressed with the extras that were included in the back, as those were a welcome addition.  The book was also laid out really well and included some good statistics.<br /><br />In all, this is a good book if you are in your 20s and don't have any idea what to do with your life.  Even after you read it, you still won't have any idea, but you will feel better about it.  3 out of 5 stars.	2005-04-09

The book went through some excellent exercises like memorizing the 50 US states and memorizing very long numbers.  And while these exercises do work (was able to do it myself), it requires a fair amount of effort to perform the memorization techniques.  Not that this is a bad thing, but if you buy this book you will need to expect to work on this everyday in order for it to work for you.<br /><br />I found the chapters of the book to be very helpful as various topics are discussed, such as: phone numbers, appointments, names and faces, the stock market, cards, and even music. I found the diversity of the chapters gave a solid foundation for expanding the techniques into other areas not covered by the book.<br /><br />I had some trouble with some of the exercises and I just was not able to come up with substitute words.  I suppose this may come with time, or maybe a larger vocabulary, but one shouldn't require a large vocabulary just to utilize their memory.<br /><br />However this book is still an excellent book to pick up and I highly recommend it.  Just be ready to put in the effort before you buy the book.  4 out of 5 stars.	2005-04-09

This concept is obviously interesting to all of us as beening able to determine when a person is communicating to you non-verbally has a lot of potential uses.<br /><br />The book unfortunately is quite old.  While body language is unlikely to change much over the years, the language used is obviously older.  The book does a good job of explaining that you can't just take one signal and immediately translate it into a message, but rather you have to look for groups of signals.<br /><br />The organization of the book is acceptable, but I wish the formatting were better in order to reference it better.  While the pictures included were good and helpful, I wish there were more of them.  I also wish there were a few pictures in an index in order to practice.<br /><br />The content of the book however is good and very informative.  I recommend this book.  4 out of 5 stars.	2005-02-27

How To Talk To Anyone goes through 92 little techniques that you can incorporate into your communication to improve the way people perceive, respect, and respond to you. The book is written in several short chapters, only about 3 pages each.<br /><br />The author gives some great advice regarding body language, facial expression, how to read people, and how to keep the conversation flowing.  The author also goes into how to sound more pleasant on the phone and how to sound like a few knowledgeable person in almost any setting.<br /><br />The author does need to work on her humor as I found her sense a little dry.  She can also tend to come across and picky and shallow from time to time, but I suppose we all have to deal with these types of people anyway.  I also really would have liked all of the summaries given at the end of each chapter to have been listed again at the end of the book, to allow one to easily review the main points without having to flip through the book.<br /><br />However I really enjoyed this book and will likely be going back to it to refresh myself and to stay on top of the techniques mentioned.  A must read. 5 out of 5 stars.	2005-02-20

The book consists of several stories of real people who have struggled with the question that the author has gone out and interviewed.<br /><br />While the topic of the book certainly caught my eye, I wasn't extremely impressed by the stories of the people.  Some were interesting, but none were really inspirational.  The book also seemed to be missing an extremely important part of the whole premise, specifically why is this question so important?<br /><br />The stories themselves are not terribly exciting.  I also didn't understand why there was coarse language sprinkled throughout the book.  Perhaps it was to keep the stories ad people \\"real\\" but I found that it added nothing to the underlying question and merely annoyed me.<br /><br />In the end the book really doesn't offer any advice or guidelines to the reader about how to go about choosing their path.  The author also inserts his own story in a few chapters but he doesn't offer any indication on the page that he is now talking about himself and not another person.  I found this to be quite annoying.<br /><br />Best bet... borrow it or pick it up if you are really having problems.  Otherwise it's just going to be a waste of time for you.  3 out of 5 stars.	2005-02-17

Speak Smart goes through all of the subtle things you don't think about when giving a talk, but really should.  Things like speech preparation, how to talk (clarity, volume, etc), non-verbal communication, presentation formats are all covered.<br /><br />Additional topics such as visual aids are looked at. My only problem with this book is that it is a little dated and didn't focus more on Powerpoint presentations, which is the defacto standard at most Universities. However additional sections of how to field questions from the audience, handling enemies, and how to prepare for a presentation make this an excellent read. The author also suggests other books for more information which I found to be invaluable.<br /><br />The book is well laid out with the main points highlighted and repeat in a appendix for easy review. The author doesn't waste pages with useless information and his humor and wit make read this book very entertaining.<br /><br />After my previous poor experiences with my last 2 Princeton Review books, I am happy to say that this is by far the best book in this series so far and I happily recommend it.  5 out of 5 stars.	2005-02-09

It's important to note that this book does not look at learning techniques but rather focuses on regurgitation or parroting.<br /><br />The ideas presented in this book are interesting and useful.  However only one idea is presented and then is repeated over and over throughout the rest of the book.  The examples are mind-numbing and I found myself skipping over most of them.  I honestly don't know why they included them in this book.  I can perform these tasks with my own material thank you very much.  The pages in the book could have been used instead for other techniques.<br /><br />The textbook section can be summed up in one sentance: \\"Read more than one textbook\\".  That's all there is to it.... but they manage to drag this on for over 70 pages!<br /><br />The test section also has some good ideas but again is padded with examples.  Probably the best part of the book is the last chapter, which ironically is the shortest (10 pages), which talks about study habits and keeping yourself focused.<br /><br />I would suggest that you don't buy this book.  Get it from the library or borrow it and then skim over it.  You should be able to get through this thing in just a couple of days.  3 out of 5 stars.	2005-02-03

Bill Perkins does a good job of explaining why men are so suseptable to lust and gives some practical methods to help defeat temptation.<br /><br />Bill Perkins starts off by examining the reasons behind lust and why it's so addictive.  From here he moves on to admitting that lust has control over you and knowing that dispite all that you have done, your heavenly Father still accepts you and loves you for who you are.<br /><br />He also includes a chapter called \\"The Family of Origin\\" where he attempts to discuss codependence.  This chapter seemed to be out of place with the rest of the book, but was interesting regardless.  I thought that the chapter was also too short.<br /><br />From here the rest of the book focuses on breaking the addictive habits that are in place through identifying what you are losing from lust, what you could gain from eliminating lust from your life, finding a buddy or a small group with which to open up and expose your secrets and work together to lift each other up, and meditating on the Word of God.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the chapter on Buddyship where he talks about how men have lost the art of having deep relationship with other men.  He gives some excellent advice about why it is so important to have someone you can be completely open with and how it can help the both of you draw closer to God.<br /><br />This book takes a slightly more liberal approach than the book \\"Every Man's Battle\\", but is still deeply rooted in scripture.  I enjoyed this book and found it very easy to read and I would definitely recommend it, but I would also recommend \\"Every Man's Battle\\" so one get's an understanding of 2 different views.  5 out of 5 stars.	2005-01-29

While the book indeed was right that teachers tend to just teach us to read properly but not well creating a need for education directed at improving reading skills, I felt this book came up a little short in that area.<br /><br />Reading smart does indeed have some good ideas, but it tends to state them at the beginning and then repeats them and rides them for the rest of the book.  Ideas like marking up your book, prereading, think about why you are reading the selected text, what do you want to take away from it, etc.  There is a speed reading chapter, however while I found the idea to be accuracte, I found the amount of text and practice to be inadequate.<br /><br />The exercises were quite painful.... as in painfully boring.  The text selected for the exercises was from areas that I was not in the least bit familar with (Art, Politics, etc) which I found caused my comprehension to be lower than normal.  However it is still important to be able to read uninspiring material and be able to retain the material.  However I really didn't want to practice that in succession with improving retention, speed, etc.<br /><br />While I think this is a good book to read, I would have trouble saying that this is definitely a MUST read.  It has some good tools but I would look for a book with a more complete set of areas and corresponding material.  3 out of 5 stars.	2005-01-03

This easy to read book gives 21 pieces of advice to stop putting off the things that really need to be done and just do them.<br /><br />I found a lot of these examples repeated from his book, \\"Million Dollar Habits\\" but repeatition is sometimes needed to learn some techniques.  Additionally the layout in this book is much better so I highly recommend this book also.<br /><br />The mostly focuses on the importance of setting goals, planning and attacking the big tasks from a piece by piece mindset.  While I found this advice relevent and helpful, I would have liked some examples, especially in the planning part of the book.  However there are plenty of other books out there on that topic and examples were probably left out to keep the size of the book small and easy to reread.<br /><br />In all, definitely a great book and worth reading.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars.	2004-12-30

I have to admit, when I started reading Napoleon Hill's \\"Keys To Success\\" I wasn't expecting it to be a great book. I had read \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" a couple months ago and I wasn't too thrilled with the older style English and abstract thoughts without real world examples. However I can confidently say that this was a great book!<br /><br />The book goes through 17 different habits and thoughts of highly successful people. All of them are excellent techniques that a person can use to take themselves to success. Aspects like creating a definitness of purpose, creating an alliance of experts, keeping positive mental attitude are all included along with great examples and words of wisdom.<br /><br />While there is still some older style English in the book, and some abstract topics such as keeping in contact with a higher intelligence do not contain as many practical examples, I believe this is only because this refers to topics that cannot be explained as well. I also admire him for tackling the tough job of writing about such things... but it appears to be a very important issue for Mr. Hill. I tend to agree with him.<br /><br />In all, I thought this was a great read and definitely worth the time. 4 out of 5 stars for the old English... :)	2004-12-29

It also goes on to explain that there is a corelation between positive habits and success in life.<br /><br />The rest of the book goes through habits that will help you find success in several areas of your life, including busines, health, finances, and leadership. I found that the habits indeed were helpful and interesting to read. I also found the book to be helpful with practical methods to overcome some of the bad habits we tend to develop.<br /><br />In all I found this book to be a good read. I wish that the habits themselves were better organized and perhaps more pronounced in the book with format as often it was tough to tell what was a new habit and what was a follow up to a previous habit. However this book was a good read and I recommend it. 4 out of 5 stars.	2004-12-29
