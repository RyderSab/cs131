How apt what a sweet novel to take a final bow on if that is the intent. As seems to be the format of Hard Case True Crime an imprint of Liesure Publishing it is short and as others mentioned a quick read.   This story is perfect for King to exit with for a few reasons obvious to fans not so obvious to non-fans. It is great because as in his best works it has King traits throughout. For instance his characters are realistic and plausible in their humanity. In fact the Publisher of The Islander Vince Teague and his editor Dave almost echo some of King's own remarks on the subject of writing and story telling/reporting. Another trait in the best King fiction highlighted by this story is an open ended ending. The mystery is not totally solved. Life is full of unexplained incidents and mysteries and this is definitely a case of art imitating life. Here there is the unknown but both in its length and ploting this focuses on the everyday and realness of life. Making THE COLORADO KID, I repeat an excellent coda for King especially with its relative thematic stirrings raised in FROM A BUICK 8 and its accessablity to the casual reader/fan.    The last point I wish to raise in this review is a light rebuttal about the comments from reviewers critiquing the pacing of the story. In my not so humble point of view I think the pacing is dead on accurate and King is a master of pacing he has brought it up on his musings on the craft and I feel the pacing of this tale albeit slow makes instead of breaks the story.    PS I had to tack on one more observation why this series is suitable for King's publishing twilight and that is throughout his career he has been accused by some as being a \\"pulp\\" writer and he finally wrote a \\"pulp\\" fiction novel;)	2005-10-13

Rachel Morgan, the white witch was introduced by Kim Harrison in Dead Witch Walking. There readers happily met the human mom-human and her pixie and vampire companions. As we read we discovered that Rachel's self-doubts and tendencies to bite off more than she could chew was part of her wide spread appeal. <br />    In the second entry into the series Rachel is recruited be the FIB to find out who is killing ley-line witches. Luckily at the start of the tale Ms. Morgan is a fairly apt earth witch not a ley-line witch. As the plot unfolds, circumstances lead Rachel to expand her repoitiore and her dabbling in ley-line magic whicb deals with the \\"ever-after\\", and the proximity she gains on the suspect of course lands her life in peril. <br />     In a burgeoning, and some may claim over crowded sub-genre of the supernatural/paranormal thriller(horror romance) field Harrison excells. Like a maestro she conducts the population of the Hollows and their mortal neighbours in a symphony of excitement, thrills and yes even a few chills. Is her writing becoming even perhaps unintentionally more erotic? Yes is the reply to that rhetorical question. But Harrison has yet to cross the boundary where sex gets in the way of plot. Instead she uses her characters simmering sensuality as harmony to the actions melody. <br />    Is this a perfect five star novel in actuality or am I in a generous spirit as I write this review? Perhaps Harrison's fine orchestral maneveors in a dark fantasy realm inspire a little generousity from this reviewer. I will admit it is not perfect though. Readers may have their fill of this kind of fiction with writer's like Harris, and Armstrong a mere couple stepping into Rice's void with Harrison, but I feel Harrison leads the pack. I read this novel in under 36 hours I was so enthralled by Rachel Morgan and her cohorts Harrison kept me turning the pages anxiously instead of flipping pages with a been there read that attitude. So to any would be nay-sayersI proudly declare this field may be crowded but there is always room for one more of Harrison's talent. <br />	2005-09-20

The premise.plot though not truly original is close enough to originallity for this book to be worth the read alone based on plotting.  <br /> <br />Kylie O'Roarke and her husband Jack are on a chartered flight that crashes. The couple survive the accident with Jack suffering merely bruises and superficial injuries while Kylie lies in the intensive care unit in a coma. Asa Schelling reveals although both survive, the mental/psychological after effects of the crash linger in both their consciousnesses. In fact the trauma even has Kylie doubting her memories of the accident and in a larger way her very sanity, especially when reality and hallucinatory memories and images seem to coexist so nicely in her post-accident mind. <br /> <br />Schelling draws very sympathetic and realistic characters. Both the main characters and the supporting characters, heck even the \\"imagined\\" characters breathe with an amazingly deep set of lungs pulling the reader into the Boston and Savannah settings of the novel with more touch due to excellent characterization. <br /> <br />This novel due to above mentioned plot elements and characterization is a very creepy read. I will admit it kept me up more than one night. It has an almost FINAL DESTINATION meets Clive Barker feel to it. There is some gore, but it is minimal and only used to propel the story not for shock value. <br /> <br />My biggest and perhaps only qualm about this novel worth mentioning is as others have alluded to the editors could have been a little more exact in trimming some of it. I didn't notice the grammatical or factual errors at least one person mentioned, so must point out they did not interrupt the flow of storytelling for me. However in such a long novel even the most apt storytellers tend to lose interest for a few pages. In the first third of the novel I felt hammered to death with the aftermath of the crash and felt like yelling \\"OK I get it.\\" Sure Schelling kept this reader turning pages, but at the same time I would have been as entertained and felt she could have told as good a story in half the pages. However one last caveat, do not let the length intimidate you if you are interested in checking out this book, after all if you skim a few pages I won't tell a Living soul.	2005-09-19

Moore's Serenity Falls Trilogy is quietly being billed as the horror trilogy of the season.(Almost but not quite backed myself into an oxyomoron there:P) It hasn't recieved tooo much hype that I can tell, but I digress before my review has even started.  Fact of the matter is Serenity Falls is a little American town with a lot of history, much of it \\"writ in blood.\\" Centuries ago a woman accused of witchcraft was burnt at the stake, and her husband in his bitterness cursed the town. Well as Simon McGruder decides to write a book about the local history of \\"The Falls or Serenity\\" he discovers just how blood soaked the town is, which may explain its lagging success either in population growth or tourist trade. Of course there is another mystery built around this novel in the form of a stranger that seems to have supernatural abilities and a shrouded past where he made many powerful enemies who dubbed him (John Crowley) \\"the Hunter\\". Crowley is a sort of Angel(from the Buffy spinoff series) character who adds some intentional and unintentional comic relief to this short dark opening to the trilogy. In fact there was one passage I felt sure was inspired by Pratchett or Gaiman as I chuckled while reading it on the bus.    Overall this is a strong first entry into the trilogy. It has many occult/supernatural happenings to arouse the readers' interest. In fact that may have detracted a little from the work. There is so much action and while the characters are not thin per se, they could have used some development to entice the reader to continue with the series. It is almost like Moore wished to take elements of many horror novels and jam them into one book. And they almost fit and I am sure as the series continues they will, but meanwhile after reading but the first in the series I put the book down almost overwhelmed by all the elements which may or not be a good thing. On the positive side there is definitely more than enough(and not quite too much) to inspireme to start the second novel and anxious for the third to come out. I have very verbiously(is that even a word) critiqued Moore in a very backhanded fashion teehee what I started to state in a negative connotation ended up sounding very positive, well done Mr. Moore. My point was however he didn't need parts of NEEDFUL THINGS(which I think is more apt comparision IMO than Salem's Lot), SPEAKS THE NIGHTBIRD amd perhaps some Koontz thrown in to spark my interest, a simpler story would have done that just as well and still maintained my interest in the trilogy.    I gave this book 3 stars but in my heart wish to rate it 3.5 - 3.75:).	2005-07-27

Other authors get much praise for their genre-hopping/blending and yet one that has I think been overlooked is MacKay. He started out know as a science fiction writer, and this book was classified as sci-fi, however Orbis is as much alternative history as anything.  <br />       The Benefactors are \\"Angels\\" or \\"Guardians\\" in the author's America. Representations of the great theocratic government. But a Eucheistical(or something like that darn already forgot how to spell it. Minister anyhow) begins having doubts. A once loyal friend/follower of the Benefactors he is even more curious about the truth after being framed for owning contraband.  In the Benefactor's St. Lucius Latin is prohibited due to its association with the Romans (a still thriving though exiled society in the book) and radios for the same reason. A cardinal is appointed to St.Lucius and soon recruits the minister for his quest to uncover and destroy the Benefactors before their plan dooms everyone. <br />        My apologies that was not as articulate a summation as I would have liked to provide but honestly you have to really read this novel to understand the plot.  Also I encourage patience as the first half of the book seems to set the stage for the action that is to come.  <br /> <br />In fact throughout half the book I planned to give it a three star review as it was interesting in concept, but a little mediocre in execution, it took half the book for me to really realize what was going on. Not exactly a glowing recommendation, but I found the latter half as the plot thickened so to speak redeemed the story. This novel is not Excellent but it is really really good. It contains alternate history as I said, but also has an almost underlying element to myth and legend to it as well and in addition has ode to the western within its pages:P. <br /> <br />Not to repudiate my fellow(ess) reviewers, but some make this tome out to be much more controversial than I found it. The portrayal of the Indian savages remarked upon by one is no worse than anything you would find in many a Western and tamer than some.  Another person seemed to feel this book bordered on Heretical. I did not find it so, my interpretation was that MacKay wasn't denying God or even encouraging the reader to doubt. Rather his message seemed aimed against blind faith especially when that faith fell into an institution as opposed to a Deity. <br /> <br />Enough answering other reviewers that is not what this review is about. its purpose is to merely state that I really enjoyed Orbis and in writing this review hope I point other potential readers to the books charms. <br /> <br />Lestat	2005-07-13

Sansborough was introduced as CIA operative, daughter of International assassin The Xarnivore and cousin of Saraqh Walker in Lynds debut under her own name Masquerade. In this sequel she is pulled back into the espionage game when her cousin and cousin in law, fellow CIA agent Asher Flores are attacked. Someone(group)wants The Carnivores files he kept and believe Sansborough has the best job of obtaining them. Is The Coil behind the kidnapping? You have to read the novel to find out.:) <br /> <br />I am NOT going to compare Lynds to Ludlum in this review. Enough people have done so I feel the point has been made. Instead I would point out the reason for my measly three stars when this book would have gotten more if it was written by anyone else. But after discovering Lynds back in 1997 band devotedly reading every title I could get since then I have high, some may say unfair standards. I can not give a higher rating though because my expectations were so high picking up this book it was almost preordained to disappoint this reviewer. Is the prose tight? Yes. Are the characters as real as ever, and do we learn more about the charasmatic Liz Sansboruogh? Yes and Yes. Is the plot as complicated yet fluid as Lynds's previous efforts? Again I have to give a positive answer. Yet in Masquerade, Mosaic and Mesmerized Lynds added a little extra to her story a hook if you will. In Masquerade(which I will focus on it being other Lansborough title) it was amnesia, and the importance of memory on one's identity and personality traits. The Coil has a message too, and an important one granted. Yet I found myself sighing at the third or fourth protest of Liz how she hated violence. Pacisifism is important especially in the post 9/11 world, but the theme paled compared to other issues Lynds has penned. I reread Masquerade as I read The Coil and although I enjoyed the latter I was blown away yet againby how amazing the former hit me viscerally getting a reaction from almost every organ in my body at different points. I am tempted after all this protestation to award this title the extra star just because it is a more polished tale, but instead will close by saying sometimes when you set the bar in the genre so high even you can not clear it with every novel published.	2005-07-12

I expected the explicit sex and gore this book contains. However I had not prepared myself for how tight the plotting was, in this story about struggling screenwriter trying to discover the truth that led him to identify his ex-wife Amy's corpse and his friend Jeff finding his missing btother Mitch Shirley juggles his subplots with aplomb as the story heats up. The friends discover, along with an ex-addict counsellor looking for his daughter about the Akishra. Astral plane parasites that feed on addictions. <br /> <br />This novel as others have pointed out is a cautionary tale in a maccabre setting about addiction. Like all the best horror however there are undertones such as a not so covert indictment against the shallowness of Hollywood and the upper classes in America. Shirley doesn't preach just let his prose scare the bejesus out of his audience setting us straight. A casual read may lead one to think this novel was aimed at a younger audiences(for intstance those that love the slasher movies), but with the subtext tight plotting expand the demnographic that can appreciate this story into any horror fan. I strongly recommend checking this title out, just as long as you havem't eaten immediately beforehand.	2005-07-09

The fact of the matter is King's writing is honest as Straub says in an elegant introduction, which is what inspires legions of fans to want to read everything available that he has written be it fiction or non-fiction. <br /> <br />SECRET WINDOWS is set up as a book of the month club companion piece to King's bestselling memoir/how-to guide ON WRITING. Apart from a very heartfelt ode in the introduction by King's fellow master of horror and collaborator Straub it contains various essays and short works of fiction dedicated to the art of writing. The dates of the pieces in the collection range from when Stephen was a wee lad of 12 writing for his brother's paper to the time of publication.  There are some well known pieces, such as short stories that have later been published in his Everything's Eventual anthology, and an excerpt from his other well-known non-fiction piece Danse Macabre to some real hidden gems that have never been published before. One of these gems is a short talk/essay on banned books. Another is great opening lines that are favourite of King's. <br /> <br />In Secret Windows, just like in his fiction King's integrity shines through; he claims not to be the best novelist around even if he sells better than some but always promises to deliver the best story he knows how to write. His humour is evident in these pages even when it is self-deprecating and as a reader his same conversational tone that soaks his other works is present here as well. Danse Macabre was not the perfect book, On Writing is not the perfect book and no even Secret Windows is not the perfect book but it is darn close especially when read in conjunction with On Writing.	2005-07-05

One word and a host of preconceived ideas and attitudes are likely to pop into the average, intelligent person's head. Yet this tome by Russell Targ and Keith Harary is not as much a X-Filelike book of government conspiricies and paranormol occurances, rather it is a scientific examination of psychic abilities such as remote viewing and their pratical applications. <br /> <br />Remote viewing is an innate ability in more of the population than one might expect according to the authors. It is a phenomena where the subject can describe a target from a spatial and sometimes temporal distance.  <br /> <br />In this book the co-authors lend credibility to their experiments by reporting their findings in their investigation of Remote Viewing(and precognition) in a very clinical and scientific manner. This objective approach however does nothing to dimninish the writing as their often first person description of how an experiment is handled brings an immediacy to the writing. In other words while one may imagine an objective study of a phenomena that could have huge controversy may be dry reading the opposite is in fact true thanks to the integrity of the authors.  Each chapter in this work is progressively reaching a goal or finish line regarding the main thesis/theory of the authors. It starts out with basic definitiions and experimental descriptions, then leads to harder and wider ranging experiments with a bigger impact on both the remote viewer and society at large. <br /> <br />This book may have been more exciting if it was a huge conspiracy theory about CIA/KGB brainwashing and doing horrific experiments on subjects in mind control, but it was fascinating and credible in the matter it dealt with without need of sensationistic journalism to make it more interesting it was fascinating enough exactly how it was written.	2005-06-26

His friend helps him slip into the past for the first time which only deepens the mystery of who the Witches of Chiswick are and their diablical plans to change the future/past. Luckily Will has help from his mate Matt and Barry(a talking magical sprout) in his time travelling adventures.<br /><br />  The first few chapters of this novel, while being humurous are quite confusing in nartative structure and plotting, however Ranking quickly cleans up his style to tell his story with witty satire and deep ideas a la Pratchett. In some ways I found this title to be clearer and funnier than Thief of Time, but Rankin is no Pratchett.<br /><br />  While Rankin fills his novel with tons of theories and ideas each getting minimal airplay for humour over substance Pratchett will seemingly take one central thought and suffuse his novels with juxtopositions of same. I am not claiming one is better than the other, merely saying two humurous authors with different approaches to their satire.<br /><br />This book is definitely not Pratchett lite and although I would recommend it to PTerry fans I would caution them against reading with that mindset and suggest they suggest the jokes that work, ignore the jokes that don't(and with the difficulty of writing humour there is admittedly bound to be jokes that fall flat which happens here once or twice.) and enjoy Rankin for his own brand of fantastic fiction.	2005-06-14

There are a couple ways of reading Miller's INSIDE OUT, as a great novel with multiple sub-sub-plots, or as a great novel with one big complicated (but not too complex) plot. Either way this is one heck of an enjoyable thriller. <br /> <br />Winter Massey is an United States Deputy Marshal, who after a phone call from long standing friend Greg Nations, expands his specialty from tracking down fugitives to working a Witness Security detail for assassin Dylan Devlin and his lovely wife Sean. Dylan was a contract killer for Sam a godfather type figure in the New Orleans Mob, hence the need for protection. However even some of the best marshals fail to protect the target, leading a reader to think oh oh end of story...Wrong after Dylan is hit the real action/intrique begins. <br /> <br />Miller does an excellent job building the principle characters into people a reader wishes to get to know better, and luckily this is the first of a projected Winter Massey trilogy. <br />Winter is a complex widower whose son is blinded in the plane accident that killed his wife. Rush is a very likable boy as well, and Miller paints a teasing glimpse of what it must be like to be a young person that is \\"handicapped\\" with loss of sight. Rush and Lydia, Winter's mother are both intricite pieces to a plot whose focus is largely around family. <br /> <br />This novel is virtually non-stop action, that would make an excellent movie as well as the casting is right and the actors do not overly play their roles. There are stereotypes in this book which is one of the reason it recieved 4 stars instead of five. Overall a great read anytime but I would credit the publishers for releasing the first entry when they did as it really seems with the action and pacing to be a custom made beach read.	2005-06-09

What made him such a notorious/infamous serial killer in American History? <br /> <br />These are a few questions author Schecter answers in this historical true crime biography. He details Mudgett's, aka Holmes's childhood in very brief detail in New Hampshire then follows the killer's life story into young adulthood in Englewood Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. He also makes passing mention of another infamous killer, Jack the Ripper, as a contextual setting. One of the things this author excells at in fact is context. He opens his book with a description of Chicago circa the late nineteenth century including detailed passages of the Chicago Fair.  He objectively reports the marriages of Holmes to his various wives and his affairs with other young women who end up becoming his victims. <br /> <br />Schecter then describes assorted get rich quick schemes Holmes had dreamt up in order for him to afford his rather at the time extravagant lifestyle. It turns out it was one of his insurance frauds that led to him to be unveiled as the monster the public would come to know him as being.  <br /> <br />This true crime book is very entertaining in a rather morbid and sordid sense. However I found some parts too detailed lengthening the tale for no apparant reason other than to increase the number of pages or so it seemed to me. I was fascinated to the extent it revealed about Holmes yet found in part it only truely whet my appetite to read more about him, which of course may have been its aim. <br />	2005-05-30

Yet despite losing his cool at a bank meeting regarding the repossession of his truck(his livlihood)and attacking and sccidentily killing a bank employee he remains a sympathetic character. The reader can feel his desperation as he heads south with two colourful bounty hunters, one a \\"freak\\", and the other an Elvis impersontor on his tail. <br /> <br />That has always been one of McCammon's strengths the, the portrayal on paper of fictional characters that are believable to the nth degree, and that can touch the reader's hearts and minds. There are no heroes or villians in this slight departure from some of McCammon's well-known works, but rather a collection of anti-heroes colourfully brought to life to drive a powerful narrative. <br /> <br />What a clever novel. Without wanting to include too many spoilers in this review I may say it should be no surprise the title is in fact a phrase with double meaning.  <br /> <br />This story is atypical as pointed out above of some of McCammon's works, he is known for sharing a genre with Koontz and King after all but this is no horror story, rather a moving thriller that plucks all the heartstrings of a reader. Hopefully this review does not make this tome sound wishy washy as it is far from that, rather the author's storytelling prowess are at their peak telling a tale about a disenfranchised Vietnam vet, that I would argue was even more powerful than King's Hearts in Atlantis. This book would in fact get five stars, but of course it was not PERFECT, there were some issues I shared with fellow reviewers about the ending that did not diminish however the overall impact of the novel.	2005-05-30

Well present time upon publication which was 1975 so the text is a little dated, but that is not his fault. <br /> <br />In a preface Ashley has the respect for his readers to explain his journalistic biases. This as far as I am concerned is excellent as there is definitely bias shown in the writing. He is almost a reincarnation of Freud, who as Ashley describes partook of cocaine himself as well as prescribing it to others. What I mean is that he seems very pro-cocaine in moderation and denies evidence of its addictive properties. <br /> <br />This is a very interesting text on the drug and I learnt a lot from reading it, this really does deserve more than three stars however my own bias factors into the writing of this review. In certain hands this could be read almost as an endorsement of cocaine and since I believe it is an addictive narcotic despite Ashley's claims, I would add a caveat to any reader to take his reasearch and it is very well researched with numerous sources sited in the endnotes with a grain of salt and don't believe everything you read. <br /> <br />And do not use this book to do lines off of it is only meant to be read.	2005-05-30

However before readers of the Da Vinci code, and there are a few, decide that they have read this before and therefore there is no need to read THE PEGASUS KEY please read this review. <br />     Langford Rielly is an ex-Cia agent, whose sister and nephew are killed in a firebombing. Just because Lang had changed his career to become a lawyer does not however mean he can turn a blind eye to justice, or vengeance however, and he vows to discover the reason behind their tragic deaths no matter where it leads him. The key seems to be a copy of a painting, that is a map leading to...well you will have to read this excellent book to find that out. <br /> <br />Loomis apparantly worked on his manuscript for a couple years at least, which should prove there is no intentional copying or mimicking here. Although the plot is similiar to Brown's Pegasus is not the first thriller to run into similiar plots, in fact Da Vinci for all its controversy is hardly the first novel to raise questions concerning church dogma. Now that I have laid to rest my defense for the plot I will focus on Loomis's excellent characterization and pacing. This is an extremely readable novel, written at a compelling fever pitch where the pages are soaked with characterization and action. Loomis flips from third person narration to first seamlessly. It has fascinating historical details which although fictional are interesting enough in that there is evident factual research at play in the story.  <br /> <br />This novel is not extremely long and depending on readers' commitment to Loomis's storytelling can be read in a matter of days but hopefully kept on the shelf to be re-read, in fact after just finishing it I almost want to reread it immediately I enjoyed it that much. <br /> <br />One more thing, some may intepret this review as a dissing of Da Vinci Code and I want to assure Amazon browsers that is not my intent I also really liked Brown's novel. I just want to restate that this is an excellent alternative or addition to anyone's reading list that already contains The da Vinci Code. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-16

The main premise/thesis is an examination into the human (and a few other intelligent mammals') minds, examining its wonders and mysteries tying the mind into paranormal phenomenon in more instances than not.  <br /> <br />It is an in depth examination regarding psychology, parapsychology and the seperation of the mind from the brain. This book looks at how someone can share dreams, how someone can damage a great portion of their brain and have a high iq, encounters with UFOs and other paranormal activities. It asks pertinent questions about the boundarie of reality and mass mind control. <br /> <br />In short this book is almost impossible to read without some reflection and genuine insight on the part of the reader. Each section is short and sweet. In other words although there is no real in depth study given to any particular aspect of the mind there are in most instances case studies providing evidence or at least plausible theories behind some phenomenon. Having stated that though it is not some exploitive sensational enquireresque publication. The editorial staff/contributors do not come across as gullible, and ask the reader to think about the answers behind the sections for themselves in their style of writing without making predetermined judgements about the truth of the various reportings. When they write about an incident involving the paranomal or occult they do not ask that the case study be taken as gospel truth, but offer a pro and con attitude behind every finding, leading the reader to draw their own conclussions. <br /> <br />This book not only entertained and informed me but as I said it also made me think. Not only about the subject matter, but there were brief sections that made me say to myself \\"Oh my G*d that makes so much sense, thank you for providing me with that wonderful psychological insight into myself. As I said it is a very thin volume, but I would think its purpose is not to provide all the answers to the marvels of the mind, but rather to act as a starting point to interest the reader enough that they will follow up on some key points to them and learn even more about the subject.	2005-05-16

It briefly illustrates the history of the Beat Generation (the generation labelled from about the late 1940s to the late 1960s although many beat writers published into the nineties). The \\"beatniks\\" were disenfranchised, disillussioned precursers to the hippies and had their own view of there world. The beats' philospohy was a hodgepodge of anti-trust towards established authority, some middle and far eastern movements such as Zen, and an almost nihilistic (although the famous writers would argue being called nihilistic I bet) thirst for freedom. Especially freedom of expression wanting to use the written language to spread their message. <br /> Mel Ash profiles the most famous Beat Writers such as the \\"prophets of the movement\\" Burroughs, Ginsburg, and Kerouc. He provides a brief biographical blurb and then provides exercises for the reader to complete in their \\"Beat Journal\\" in an effort for them to have a better understanding of said author. Better yet though Ash does not stop at the big three, but also provides information on some of the lesser known \\"beats\\" who while not as famous as the others still contributed much to their subculture. <br /> <br />  This book is so close to having five stars because A:) It really is informative in brief sections aimed at getting the reader to write and think about the writing style and background philosophy behind the beat movement. B:) I have read most of THE PORTABLE BEAT READER (not to compare apples and oranges as that is an anthology and this is a self-help manual), but found myself much more in tune to the spirit reading this interactive book. <br /> <br />However as much as this book had it was not perfect it could have had even more biographical blurbs and exercises, but that is a very n itpicky point. So I recommend this book to readers who are interested in \\"Beat\\", to writers who wish to open up a new side to their writing, andto people searching for something without knowing precisely what they seek. Wow just about for everyone then teehee. <br />	2005-05-09

Famous Art Critic Philip Grove is found dead in an apparant Spontaneous human combustion with other clues leading some to speculate the Devil claimed his soul. Luckily Pendergast is now reunited with Vinnie D'Agosta (From the Relic) now working as a Southhampton Sergeant to help in the case. <br /> <br />This latest novel featuring Agent Pendergast, like most of them is much more than a gripping thriller. It is even more than a compelling whodunit, as Preston and Child continue to evolve their arguably most popular character he is a blend of Mulder, Sherlock Holmes and Murder She Wrote heroine rolled into one. Just as there is an allusion to an Agatha Christie novel this story is indeed a fitting send up to some of the best the genre has to offer. The tone and pacing is very Doylesque and without wanting to provide too many spoilers the villian is even worth of a Professor Moriarty. <br />This novel does have elements of horror to it but is not exceptionally graphic and the horror elements are more to complement the rest of the plot than to propel it into bestseller lists (where it belongs with no fictional gender-bending voodoo needed). <br /> <br />Overall A big satisfying novel with a surprise and cliffhanger ending to whet readers' appetites for more.	2005-05-08

The Ninja titles tended to flash back often providing hints about title character's past. In his most recent work he is more subtle about linking the past to the present as Lustbader adopts the ever growing in popularity Bourne.<br /><br />Jason Bourne is the alter ego (the Mr Hyde if you will) to Professor David Webb. When Webb's family got killed CIA agent Alex Conklin recruited him and helped mold him into an excellent assassin/operative. Years later someone has murdered Conklin and Bourne's other friend/psyciatrist Mo Panov and framed Jason Bourne for the deed. With CIA and a mysterious assassin dogging his trail Bourne must survive long enough to get at the truth.<br /><br />This is not Ludlum's writing, to state the obvious therefore those making comparisions between this title and the original trilogy are bound to feel disappointed. However Eric Van Lustbader is a talented author whose own interpretation of the mythos is well worth checking out. He weaves a tight thriller shifting scenes and action almost flawlessly with on or two exceptions where I admit it(the narrative) jerked from one scene to another so hastily and disjointedl;y I checked if I skipped pages accidentily. Overall though the minor critiques I reserve do not overshadow the fun and pleasure I recieved from reading this entry. As a bonus although it may be tricky this could be a stand alone introduction to Bourne's universe as well as a continuation of the story.	2005-04-23

Yet it belongs in the same classification as Donna Tartt's My Secret History a pseudo-thriller very literately penned. Although Dorcasm twin of Abigail (a modern Aphrodite) is a librarian with a love of books, that is not why I call it lieterary. Although the supporting characters Guy and Hilda are artusts and writers this fact alone does not make it literary in my view either. Rather it is the whole essence of the narrativem the sense one gets of Willet's love of the English language and the care the author takes stating exactly what shen means to write, i.e. each sentence has been pored over and written with greast care a rare trait for novelists these days. You can tell Ms. Willett is very well read just by reading this novel.  <br /> <br />Admittedly at first I found the narrative structre a little hard to get into, but then about a third of the way through the novel I was hooked finding this novel of familial loylalty and angst an extremely well written read. I recommend this book to fans of Donna Tartt and David Sedaris. If you enjoyed Wally Lamb's I Know this Much is True there is a good chance you will enhoy this as well. The characters are beyond well drawn the pace is perfect for the story. This is not neccessarily a fast read or a novel you might breeze through in a day but I predict if you take time to savor the story and can appreciate the dark sometimes subltle humour/irony you will love this book as much as I ended up loving it.	2005-03-29

THE OCTOBER HORSE is Colleen McCullough's final entry in her \\"First Man in Rome\\" series. It wraps up her chronicle of the Roman Republic and dawn of the Roman Empire. <br /> <br />In the opening chapters Caesar meets Cleopatra in Egypt, and thereafter it tells of the growing conspiracy against Rome's general that had never lost a battle. It introduces Caesar's nephew and adopted son Octavius, who would grow into Caesar's inheritance and become Augustus Caesar. McCullough also reacquaints readers with famous senators Cicero, Mark Antony and others. <br /> <br />As in the previous books in the series McCullough intricately weaves the setting back to ancient Rome, bringing alive the near mythological characters in her novel for the reader. With so little written about Julius Caesar, both non-fiction and fiction wise, I feel she deserves even extra credit for painting such a vivid literary portrait of the great man. In some instances in the novel it seems like she may romanticize Caesar a little, after all it is hard to believe he was really that noble a citizen who achieved such lofty success. Yet as a reader relatively unfamiliar with Caesar she argued well a case for his deserving of immortality. <br /> <br />Although fictional, one browse through her afterward complementing the story itself is testament to the time and research she spent penning the tale. This is indeed a powerful story and I for one am so saddened that the story is now finished I plan to re-read this series at least once. <br /> <br />Ave Caesar, Ave Ms. McCullough!	2005-03-29

Amazon and my reviewing colleagues have summarized this plot very well permitting me to exercise some laziness and post a few bullet points in this review. <br />            - Victor Frankenstein lives, and with his ego and penchant for playing God intact is given 21st century technology for his experiments. <br />            - Deucalion is Frankenstein's monster from the nineteenth century, also surviving over 200 years and naming himself after mythological Prometheus's son. <br />            - Deucalion tracks Victor to New Orleans (a very suitable locale for a neo-gothic remake.) in order to finally rebel against his programming and destroy his creator. <br />             -There could easily be half a dozen sub-plots spiraling around inside the larger retelling of the Frankenstein mythos here. <br /> <br />Kevin J. Anderson is going to fairly or unfairly gain some kudos and credit for this story's crispness. I commented to any that would listen that although I am a fairly large Koontz fan I found the latter offerings I have read by him to be overly verbiose. I thought while reading BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON for example \\"Ok Mr. Koontz we realize you enjoy and have fine grasp of English language I see no need for every second paragraph to me metaphorical, or other wordplay\\".  However in this novel the writing is sharp and succinct, doing an admirable job of being clever yet seamlessly interweaving and sewing a huge tapestry of plots and sub-plots into one very compelling suspenseful tale. So yes Koontz gets his lion share of credit for this excellent horror/suspense novel as well perhaps being reminded to return to his roots (before his language got a little flowery) and telling the story he had to tell and readers virtually have to read.  <br />Also as in all good multi-part suspense novels this was ended perfectly with a cliff-hanger making me at least eager for the conclussion.	2005-03-13

Island falls whole-heartedly into the latter category. Will Farnaby a reporter with ulterior motives finds himself stranded on the tropical island of Pala. The readers' learn the religio-socio-philosophical engine that drives Pala as Will does. It is a utopian society formed around sensuality, and mind enlightening drugs. <br /> <br />This novel is a philosophical treatise in disguise. It is a worthy tract comparable (as some here have I believe) to Candide and Gullivers Travels (but on acid.) The prose is very lucid in parts, yet also a little wacky(not most literate term but nothing else is coming to mind) at times. I could picture Huxley ingesting his muse opening the doors of perception and writing furiously. In fact I admit I have not braved the new world, but have read Huxley's THE DOORS OF PERCEPTION/HEAVEN AND HELL and enjoyed that more mainly because it didn't wear the disguise of a work of fiction. This is a fine satirical commentary on the human condition and would have rated four stars from me if the ideas expressed were not recycled in some cases from DOORS OF PERCEPTION.	2005-03-11

Kerry's enthusiasm wanes however when she meets the eccentric sculptor, and disappears completely when she stumbles into the model family for his Family Planning 9 series. <br /> <br />This novel is not for the faint of heart. It is very graphic in its depiction of violence and sex. In fact this was a book, that compelling though I found the writing to be I could only read a few pages at a time so disturbing was some of the imagery conjured by Nykanen. The author did a good job of alternating the narrator's point of view throughout the story from first person point of view to third person (when describing Lauren and reporter's Ry's scenes.) I think this device was more than sleight of hand to make story more interesting no tricks were neccessary to accomplish that feat. It allowed the reader to pull away momentarily from the deranged mentallity of Stassler. The characters could be described as thin in some instances but I found Nyaken to have formed an excellent cast of main characters in the ninth family's young daughter and Stassler, who are what the novel's plot really revolve around. Even after finishing this novel a week ago I still carry around some of the nightmare images and impressions in my skull now that is what I would call art.:)	2005-03-11

The premise is the ancient origins of science. Andrew Gregory focused much of his attention of course on the Greeks, I suppose the philosophy of their \\"big names\\" like Socrates, Plato and Aristotle naturally evolved into natural philosophy, a point hinted at in the text. <br /> <br />However I felt slightly gypped(sp?) as my limited knowledge of the subject led me to believe scienctific thoughts were around the Babylonian and Phoenician culture(who got very little space in book). Then I reread the blurb on back and realized this book delivers exactly what it promises. <br /> <br />It is the birth of science, charting how the ancient Greeks turned away from supernatural, and mythological explanations of the universe and looked instead for natural reasons. It is very make that VERY readable. Without talking down to his audience Gregory relates how various schools of thought sought to enlighten humanity about the cosmos, human anatomy etc... <br />in very simple layperson's terms so a degree in science is unneccesary. <br /> <br />It is a little book, yet that too delivers the promise of the title as it is the birth of science so it like a birth deals with the very beginning although light mention is made of scientific discovery's toddler years and adolescence.  <br /> <br />A fascinating read, although I confess found the latter chapters especially one on science's ties to Astrology and Alchemy to be my favourites.	2005-03-03

Thankfully his friend Parker is a lawyer yet even Parker and a dream team may not save David Remler. <br /> <br /> <br />This novel is so full of twists and turns it defies cliche. Roughan has a very likable first person narrator that as a reader I was rooting for no matter how bleak the situation. His supporting characters are also as another reviewer mentioned likable as well. The plot although explored in other novels is presented in a fresh fast moving style as opposed to what could have been a tired haven't I read this before fashion. My only half negative comment is the motivations behind the \\"villian\\" could have been a little more in depth. Otherwise while this is not literature it is a sharply written thriller that should be enjoyed when read as such. Roughan also cleverly played on the title of Roughan's book \\"The Human Pendulam\\", whose premise was even good people can do ineplicable acts of evil to make the plot swing back and forth very much a pundulam. Well done. <br />	2005-02-28

It is one volume divided into three books, which are all interconnected as part of the larger story, This book might be intimidating to some readers by its sheer size/weight. However if you enjoy historical fiction and a good story I humbly ask that you read this book.  <br /> <br />Readers of Cryptomonicon will recognize some of the characters in this novel, as their family names imply that they are the ancestors of popular people from Cryptomicon. As a bonus the seemingly ageless Enoch Root (from Cryptimonicon) cameos in this tome.  <br /> <br />Book 1 mainly focuses on Daniel Waterhouse and the Royal Society. There are many references to Leibniz Isaac Newton and other key personages from the era. It is a neat study of natural philosophy and a fictionalized account of some of the activities of the study of natural philosphy and birth of modern science. (Though from the interview at the end of book with Mr. Stepehnson he implies it is not that fictionalized i.e. the activities of experiments are likely to be representative of what was happening at the time.) <br /> <br />Book 2 introduces more characters including Jack Shaftoe, the Vagoabond king and Eliza. This book details more of some of the poilitical intriques that were part of the seventeenth century and nicely portrays the origins of the art of espionage. <br /> <br />Book 3 Unites Eliza with some of the Royal Society members and further expands the plot of the first two books. There is fine dexriptive detail of a fight scene and the tower of London (which was both a prison and the mint at the time). <br /> <br />As I stated this is a huge book and does involve a bit of a commitment in the reading of it. Some critics and fans might claim Stephenson uses three pages to describe something that could have been aptly done in three paragraphs. However personally and maybe being such a huge fan of Dickens(who is often unread due to sheer wordiness of prose) accounts for me finding that lush complete detail a positive attribute of the novel instead of a negative one.  In fact my only negative comment, and here I may be alone is in Eliza's character. I had a hard time trying to figure out who exactly she was supposed to be(which might have been intentional on Stephenson's part). She was a very strong women which is refreshing but seems to act of of character occassionally throughout text. Also I felt more could have included Newton's personality (as author sees him at least.) again though I guess that was intentional too as part of Newton's charm is the enigmatic cast to his being. <br /> <br />Overall I say do not let length intimidate you fellow readers instead dig and enjoy an incredibly accurate(I assume teehee) depiction of the baroque era.	2005-02-21

As it turns out what was originally thought to be a possible case of mass hysteria turns out to be an invasion of a sleepy town by pod-like aliens who then take over the populace's appearances and identities. <br /> <br />Admittedly other reviewers summed this book up better than I, which I attribute partly to my not wanting to give any plot away (for those Amazonians that have not had the pleasure of reading this book yet), and partly because as one reviewer pointed out the alien invasion plot was hardly original even at the time of this title's publication. Writers of Finney's era seemed to thrive on metaphorically writing about the \\"red\\" threat of communism.  <br /> <br />Finney may not have been the first or last to write on the theme but he did an exceptional job re-visiting other author's alien plots and using his unique style and imagination to write perhaps the seminal novel on the subject. From the opening pages I was scared. Reading each paragraph with a mounting sense of dread as Finney did an excellent job pacing his novel. <br /> <br />Certain scenes jumped out in this relatively thin tome(compared to some horror novels Body Snatchers is almost a novella with an economy of words to do the job of scaring readers) placed within the story for maximum effect. When Miles, and Jack discovered the \\"blank\\" slate of a body in Jack's basement I thought \\"oh sh*t\\" presumably as Finney intended I should. <br /> <br />As stated this isn't longest horror novel ever and there was no need for it to have been. Finney uses the perfect amount of words to tell his open ended tale of alien takeover elegently and with such an influx of paranoia in the text I reflected upone completion \\"they sure don't write them like that anymore but I wish they did.\\" <br /> <br />In summation a classic in the genre in the purest sense of the phrase.	2005-02-19

When Bobby the bookscout is murdered, he begins investigating with his partner until psat demons cause his suspension and resigning from the force. He opens a bookstore hoping the police will solve the case without him, yet is inevitably drawn back into it when death strikes his hired staff. <br /> <br />Cliff is an immensely likable character reflecting readers' passion for the written word and becoming a vehicle for Dunning (himself a dealer) to educate us on some of the finer points of collecting while entertaining us with a mystery. Cliff is not perfect a combination of brute police mentality and a poet, which duality is part of his appeal as a character. I scanned enough reviews in various Janeway titles to note the public clammoring for more of him. Dunning's supporting characters are also well written, and intrique. <br /> <br />The plotting is good as well my main and perhaps only notable critique of this novel as a whole is a sub-plot which is perhaps too much of a co-plot for it to have maximum effect. (Those demons of Janeway's maybe should have been kept a little more in background of story as opposed to having equal billing as the main mystery). <br /> <br />Dunning does an admirable job introducing a new series that touches any fan of rare and first editions and anyone curious about the book business. <br /> <br />Bravo.	2005-02-19

Christopher is busy as the Secretary General of the UN preparing a de-populated humanity for the New Age. Decker Hawthorne his left hand man (and ironically posible betrayer) gets kidnapped again this time by the KDP and fundamentalists just before he can receive the communion. (The communion is taken to expand human's lifespans and decrease disease and all who have partaken of this treatment bear a mark as predicted in Revelations.) Doubts begin to stir in Decker Hawthorne's mind as he is treated well by his \\"captors\\" and has debates over religion with them. <br /> <br />This last title is full of action. Many things happen heralding the dawn of a New Age, and the Apocolypse. de Beauseigneur narrates in the same style sa his other novels as an objective observer stating the action as signs permeate the story. He also very clearly reinforces his warnings written prefacing each title by ending his dark, mysterious trilogy in a very Christian manner. Disposed are some of the controversial ideas espoused in earlier titles. He does not preach to the reader yet very clearly states that his characters reflect his own religious beliefs and seems to use his novelization as a platform to critique where society is heading, (away from faith in powers greater than themselves.) So on this score I would pat him on the back and call him successful. <br /> <br />My quibbles are similiar to the first two volumes. While the story telling is overall exciting, there are moments when I felt a less detached narration may have been useful. One of his footnotes was wrong, and almost made me put off reading this thrilling conclusion indefinitely. Luckily for me I lay to rest the miffed reference and enjoyed the actionreach its stunning and worthy finale.	2005-02-06

Woodworth grabs the readers' attention from the first pages and doe not let it go. Woodworth makes excellent use of language to write on the themes of death and afterlife, excellently conveying the lonliness of his principal charaters making them realistic.

He prints out pages and pages of suspense, International intrique, and a dab of romance between his lead characters(probably preparing for a Hollywood adaptation.) The main flaws I found with this thriller was its pace. While entertaining and intriquing enough to finish, it lagged purposely in parts. There was enough suspense, but not quite enough action to rate higher on my own scale of thriller novels. <br /> <br />This is a well written novel, with an interesting enough premise and plot to be worth the read yet would not label it a \\"must-read\\" by any means.	2005-01-25

Yet that doesn't prevent her from lighting this novel up the way she has lit up his previous novels. <br /> <br />Omega is a malevelant(presumably) destroyer of civilizations, a space-cloud that had wiped out a couple societys in the distant setting in which the novel is based in, and there is an Omega clou heading to earth in oh about 900 years or so. Therefore nobody takes nuch notice of the far from imminent crisis, as they study the phenomenom in the most abstract terms. Until a sentient race is discovered on a planet due to be hit by an Omega in the very near future. The inhibitants or Goombahs as the media has dubbed them are a very cute and popular species making the effort to divert the cloud and save them even more politically intense. Priscilla almost launches a rescue mission of teams forbidden to break protocol i.e. letting the \\"Goombah's\\" learn of the human existence which makes the mission even more unlikely to succeed. <br /> <br />McDevitt has been given due for his ability to create alien systems/races and planets. This is clearly a novel of him highlighting his strengths as a writer as the Goombah's are almost more fully characterized than their human counterparts. The reader is made to fully understand the workings of Goombah society, their daily life, entertainment sexual practices, religious maxims etc... <br /> <br />I surmise the author went out of his way to use this book as an expression of some of his own beliefs and values, there were passages I drew an imaginary parallel to Gulliver's Travels. The Literati would probably be offended by such a comparision, yet I feel McDevitt echoed some of Swift's message in a far away setting in the far future. This is more than mere entertainment and high space drama, it is a story with meaning (whether intentionally inserted into the tale by the author or not the meaning is still evident to this reviewer and can be interpreted by any reader however they like.) <br /> <br />There are no clear answers to the Omega offered by McDevitt but I think that was part of his point and should not subtract from one's enjoyment of this book.	2005-01-25

His latest title I read focuses on a mysterious disappearance followed by some mysterious deaths in a small town in Long Island. East Harbour's police force do not recieve much respect, as they mainly direct traffic and are thought to be overrated meter maids by the general populace. Justin Westwood however was not always a glorified meter maid he was a former top-notch detective whose instincts begin to resurrect themselves when a popular reporter is killed, and tied to a movie loving buff who also dies shortly afterward.  While trying to protect an eye-witness to the reporter's death, and keep himself alive Justin is determined to get to the bottom of the mystery. <br /> <br />This is another sharply written offering from Andrews. I could debate this is his tightest most plot driven title yet. The pages virtually turned by themnselves as I read through the novel. Even though there are hints of where he is going around the halfway mark I found myself intriqued enough by his literary route to that destination to read on. <br />This novel is far from perfect though and in some key elements does not measure up to his earlier books in my opinion. While Justin was more than another angst driven cop with a dark past, but was instead a fleshed out well'drawn character I found some of the supporting characters lacking when compared to his well penned supporting casts in other stories. As I said the plot was good, and maybe Andrews drifted slightly from character driven techniques into plot driven books. The \\"bad guys\\" were interesting, and the ultimate villian was good but both could have been better. <br /> <br />Otherwise this is an author whose prowess I continue to admire as I am continuously enteretained by each new novel I read.	2005-01-21

What ought we as a society ought not to know? Is any knowledge Forbidden? In this day and age where science and technology make learning easier than ever are there still taboos in society? <br /> <br />He answeres these questions by anaylzing art and science from (as title says) Prometheus to Pornagraphy(although his main examble of latter is de Sade which is debatable today after his \\"ehabilitation\\" how pornographic de Sade remains.) He dissects various literary examples of his theme. <br /> <br />Shattuck does an excellent mini survey of classics such as the Divine Comedy and Milton's Paradise Lost citing examples relelvent to forbidden knowledge. It is obvious he did his research before undertaking to write this book. <br /> <br />This is not the easist read. Shattock does an excellent job writing on this topic yet already some of his material seems dated or irrelevent through no fault of his own. It just seems like in the twenty-first century the author has a uphill strugle convincing any reader who has access to the internet that certain experiences and fruits of knowledge should be left alone. Aloso Shattock does not dumb down his tome at all which is another reason for it not being easist read. As a layperson and not expert in literature or science I found myself really having to concentrate, and in cases re-read passages to understand what he was saying. <br /> <br />However all that said this book is really interesting and made me think about the topic in ways unbefore thought.	2005-01-17

She has no memory of her past life. Luckily her neighbour Mike is there for companionship and to help her get through the nightmares that have plagued her new life. Dark dreams in which mirrors are much more than mirrors. A string of ritualistic murders in London is soon connected to Mike and Rachel and ahhh the plot thickens. <br /> <br />This is a very strong debut effort showcasing Ms, Pinborough's talents. There are echoes of King, Lovecraft and Matheson within this novel, but it is very much told in the author's unique voice. The Hidden's terror is built in a very suspenseful manner and is tinged with just enough graphic gore and sensuality to satisfy most bloodthirsty horror fans. The novel never goes over the top though, Pinborough maintains a nice style without any gratuitous sensationalism and using an economy of pages. There are unresolved issues as another reviewer pointed out, but one of the best trademarks of true horror is the questions left unanswered. Character development was a little on the light side, yet there was enough there that I was touched reading scenes that were meant to move the reader. I am fairly discrimitory in my horror reading as there is like in any genre an onslaught of bad writing, but Pinborough definitely doe NOT fall into this category. A very scary first novel and I look forward to follow up releases.	2005-01-08

After a part she auditioned for, with her best friend who gets the soap opera role, falls through Johanna is depressed. Her spirits are lifted when she meets author Matt. Matt quickly wins Johanna's heart in a whirlwind romance and invites her to his place in Maine for the winter. The romantic getaway is soon revealed to be a mistake as Johanna is confronted with a dark side of her lover. <br /> <br />The Verdict: <br />I did not even plan to review this novel. It struck me as entertaining, but unexceptional. Lying in bed the other night I thought about it again out of the blue and realized exactly what an excellent read it turned out to be. It is written from Johanna's perspective a device Cecilione uses quite effectively towards propelling a very twisting, and in some ways twisted plot. The ending and the fact without spoiling anything that the narrator is less than credible lifts this from just another \\"beach read\\". There were some editorial glitches and errors that affected my enjoyment to an extent. I was tempted to give it 3 stars based on little irritating inconsistancies, the lying awake thinking about it I realized that is one of the points of a good story. To remain with the reader after the fact, here the author at least in my case suceeded. That has to be interpreted if not as a scorching hot endorsement at least a warm one. There are clues dropped throughout the story to entice the reader to read on and an ending that will ultimately reward those that persevere through the tiny details.	2005-01-08
US	30101572	R60ATOGXGVY2I	0425200612	890960277	Retribution	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Very Strong First Novel	The Plot:Law Student Chloe Larsen is returning from an unpleasant date with her boyfriend when she finds herself in the sights of sadistic rapist The Clown. The man in the clown mask viciously attacks and sexually assualts Chloe leaving her sterile and with enough emotional scars to pair with each of her physical ones. The narrator then skips ahead twelve years where it is seen that Chloe has passed the Florida Bar(having skipped out on the New York one following her rape) and renamed herself C.J. a rising Assistant State Prosecuter. Just as it seems her life may rebuild itself an evil serial killer dubbed Cupid has been killing young blondes in Miami, and the task force soon arrest a suspect C.J./Chloe recognizes as the man who raped her 12 years before. <br /> <br />Strengths: Even to a jaded suspense reader like myself Hoffman although not totally successful in hiding the villian spices her plot with enough twists and turns to keep the reader entertained. She writes strong characters whose emotions and reactions to various revelations and developments ring true. This book is generally well paced with good dialogue. <br /> <br />More important than plotting however is Hoffman's treatment of justice versus retribution. The moral quagmire she places her characters in both defense and prosecution is intricately drawn and realistic(to the extent the plot of novel allows). As a reader I felt the theme was an important one to Hoffman which enhanced the pleasure I obtained. <br /> <br />Weaknesses: Very few. I would just say that like another reviewer or two I was a little disappointed with the denouement and felt even more closure could have been added. <br /> <br />Overall Recommendation: Very highly recommended I finally read it after seeing it hyped a little with good reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, and that racheted my expectations up. Those were met and overshadowed though, this is a very promising start to hopefully the first of many from this talented legal thriller author.	2004-11-10

Anyway it is not the most up to date treatise ever on the subject, which is what I had to bear in mind as I read it. <br />The preface and first chapter tie witchcraft to Satanism in a very no holds barred manner, brooking no debate. Even though I am not a practising witch or wiccan I found that offensive until I reminded myself on Summer's background and the age of text. <br /> <br />This is a history of witchcraft and Black magic and is interesting in that even though some chapter headings confused me as it took awhile for Summers to broach the various headings subjects. In other words it seemed like chapters were not neccessarily about descriptive paragraph headings. <br /> <br />This is an interesting history and Summers is quite extensive in his subject matter covered my other critique would be the absence of Aleister Crowley's absence from these pages. <br /> <br />Still an interesting and somewhat educational read.	2004-11-10

In order to obtain, or prove that such a unification is natural or suitable Ponce examines the hidden world of Astrology, Tarot, and other occult phenonemon and studies them in a very psychological and scientific matter. <br />The opening chapter particularly achieves his thesis as he traces Astrology's origins to scientific method before it became entangled with the taboo world of the occult. He footnotes and charts throughout the text various sources to back up his thesis. <br /> <br />I would guess this book is targeted at people interested in the Occult, but it also finds an audience in philosophers, and after all the much of the human race even in the twenty-first century are amateur philoaophers. MY personal opinion is that this book is well reasearched, and written. The chapter on Kabbalism was a little oblique to me, and will have to be re-read. In fact this is a very small book, and should probably be completely re-read to fully appreciate and understand the total depth of it. <br />	2004-10-22

It is a fictionalized version of the gospels after all written nearly two thousand years ago. However Meyers writes this \\"novelization\\" with admirable zest and imagination. His premise even of having the messiah born at a Motel 6 by itself is interesting, let alone some of the scenes of Eli's travels with his colorful disciples. <br /> <br />I am man enough to admit that tears glistened in my eyes reading some passages of this book. Meyers parallels the gospels setting it in modern times with no loss of power. In fact my masculinity can even bear my confessing I was outright crying by this novel's conclussions. <br /> <br />Meyer's style is not preachy, well not preachy considering this is a Christian novel. His writing is more a parable of Christs life and I would venture even to the none Christian the story itself is a worth-while read.	2004-10-22

Thomas is still the reluctant archer responsible for finding the Grail although his lack of faith in the hallowed cup finds him much more eager to be an archer and leader of man than a \\"knight of the round table following an elusive quest. The English turn back the Scots at the battle as they did historically, yet soon after Thomas's lover is killed by his cousin Guy Vexille or the Harlequin, the same man that killed his father. Around this time a captive Scot Robbie is ransomed in a manner that makes him a companion of Thomas as Thomas travels to hunt down Vexille and maybe find the Grail. <br /> <br />Bernard Cornwell perhaps is the best historical thriller writer in the business today. He economially sets scenes in fourteenth century Europe. Reading this I almost felt I had travelled back in time and joined the fictionally hero as he wandered across harsh landscape meeting bandits, corrupt monks and other dangers in his quest. Cornwell's characterization is so three-dimensional it is amazing. Instead of falling to temptation of making Thomas another Arthur or Robin Hood type hero(although there are allusions to Robin and his merry men cleverly placed in the story) he makes him a reluctant hero complete with doubts and lusts to distract him on his journey. In other words he is not infallible by any means but a portrait of perhaps a real archer in that time period. <br /> <br />Perhaps though the most interesting aspect for me was how detailed the background and supporting characters personalities are drawn. There are shifting alliances and betrayals much as I imagine there were in the historical setting. Hard to imagine how political everything was even in Medieval Europe with land being perhaps even a holier treasure than anything besides the Grail which was really hunted by many in the 14th century. But the strong writing in this second novel helped me to imagine just that and more. <br /> <br />Lovers of historical fiction, and admirers of thrillers should both give this series serious consideration.	2004-10-18

Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse(an actor), a young recently married couple(she's 24 and he's in early 30's) ditched one apartment to move into the coveted Bram vacancy. They eagerly moved into the place despite the warnings of their family friend \\"Hutch\\". <br />Soon after they move in another tragic chapter of the Bram unfolds as a young lady falls to her death. However this unfortunate incident opens the door for Guy and Rosemary to befriend their elderly neighbours.  <br />One night after a passionate and hallociagenic night of love-making Rosemary concieves the baby she has wished for. Luckily Rosemary has her nieghbours to help her through her painful pregnancy. Yet aas the Woodhouses spend more of their time with their neighbours, and Guy's career starts to skyrocket with success, Rosemary's physical pain is accompanied with suspicion and dread soaking the pages with paranoia and fear. <br /> <br />This novel was originally published over thirty years ago and yet still manages to frighten and entice fans of the genre becoming a classic. This may be explained by Levin's fluid prose using an economy of words without sacrificing the details needed to convey each dreadful scene. This horror novel is pretty clean i.e. has very minimal gore which I would argue is another sign of Levin's gifts as a storyteller scaring the reader without relying on the trendy graphic tricks all too many of today's authors use.	2004-10-18

The chancellor afraid of these youth and how they may affect society appeals to the Federation, specifically the starship Enterprise E. Meanwhile on station 88 a group of mutants familiar to Marvel comic collectors appear, yes the X-men. Soon the X-Men are guests aboard the Enterprise and drawn into the situation on Xhaldia, especially when hostile aliens start kidnapping the transformed off-planet. <br /> <br />The plot to this crossover novel is not as deep as other Star Trek novels. Then again why should it be. This is basically a story for fun. While there are some deep moments as Friedman;s description of physics in the Star Trek universe attests, and the themes that travel with the X-Men no matter what format they appear in also exemplifies. The main theme being tolerance. <br /> <br />So overall I would say it was fun and interesting to see some of my favourite comic characters guest star in the Star Trek universe and that this book is a light read. <br />With all due respect to Trekkies and comic book \\"geeks\\" if you start this novel with expectations other than a side trip of momentary amusement you are bound to be disappointed. Friedman after all handled the continuity and characterization well but I think everyone will agree this is not War and Peace:).	2004-10-17

Baldacci's answer is a split second as the premise of his introductory novel with secret service agents Sean King and Michelle(sorry blanked on last name). Sean King was guarding Presidential canditate Ritter in a Hotel when he was momentarily distracted leading to an assasin's bullet downing his principal and ending his Secret Service career.<br /><br />Eight years later an error in judgement led to the kidnapping of another Presidential candidate that Michelle was guarding leading to her career likewise turning towards a downward spiral.  Michelle turns to the now lawyerly King for help in finding her candidate.<br /><br />That plot summary was not as sharp as others but I am more concerned reviewing the actual writing in this case than writing a synopsis that could compete with others;)<br /><br />I think the first half of this novel is Baldacci's best since Total Control. His characterizations could be two dimensional save for being penned by an author who clearly imagines who these people are and expresses them very clearly to the reader. Reading it a mini-movie ran in my head complete with casting(I won't burden you with my casting choices lol), suffice to say I felt the characterization of the main characters exceptional. The plotting throughout the first half was well done, not too fast but I didn't find it plodding either in fact I found it quite gripping turning the pages as Baldacci dropped clues and several red herrings onto the readers' lap. There was an atmosphere of paranoia and distrust I found a key ingredient in Baldacci's best working novels. Furthermore there was a wry humour throughout this work and I found myself often grinning at the dialogue and even snickering at the line;\\"there are over a million lawyers in America, no wonder the country's so screwed up.\\" Also I found parts of this novel to be possibly interpreted as being very tongue in cheek poking fun at particular constituents and conspirists who still have not found the other gun man from the grassy knoll yet.<br /><br />That was the good. Now onto the bad, and ugly.<br /><br />The last quarter I would only give 2-1/2 to 3 stars to at most. The pacing sped up sure which was a positive and negative as the only possible redeeming feature of the \\"villian\\" who in the first 3/4 was clever and interesting, but when revealed became as I think another reviewer mentioned a caricature. I however interpreted this bad guy to be very Moriatiesque (or however you would say like Holme's Dr. Moriarty.) which at least made me forgive a little about the whole ending.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel a lot reading it very quickly and anxiously awaiting HOUR GAME to follow up on these characters. It is not Baldacci's best but not his worst either. A strange amagamation between the two.	2004-10-16

In the first half of this title Dr. Courtney Brown explains the difference between the conscious mind and the subspace mind. And it is with the subspace mind that people at the Farsight Institute practice Scientific Remote Viewing. <br />He writes the proceedure of a Remote viewing Session where the viewer is given a target and views it and makes deductions as to its time/place etc... <br />In the second half he chronicles a continuation of his earlier work Cosmic Voyage wherein he speculated on the existence of at least two forms of extraterrestials. This part of the book was more a journal of remote viewing sessions concerning these ETs than a scientific paper, and had some metaphysical musings thrown into the mix. <br />Overall I found the concept of this book intriquing. Scientific Remote viewing as a subject matter immediately sparked my interest and the book will push me to probe it more. In other words I would not accuse Dr. Brown of writing flights of imagination or science fiction. However I felt that although he tried to lay out his thesis (for lack of better wording) in layman's terms there is still a lot I am ignorant of after completing this book. I didn't feel I learnt as much as I could have not neccessarily blaming Brown for that more a matter of deeper reflection on my part combined with a more accessible writing style on his. Possibly the author assumed everyone reading this book had already assumed that they had already read his other title in which case that isn't true. <br />A read recommended for open-minded people only as some of his theories are quite left of center.	2004-10-16

Believe it or not this review may be my biggest challenge yet for a few reasons.   1- Until I read this title I had been a virtual autobiographical virgin, i.e. may have read one but not my material of choice as a rule and never reviewed one before.  2- Due largely to the above I agonized over trying to seperate the work from the person while planning this review before finally deciding fergeddaboudit.  3- Much as I would like to claim being ignorant of who JJ was before opening this tome, being a young(ish) male, that would be stretching crediblity.    Jenna the person: In HOW TO MAKE LOVE LIKE A PORN STAR: A CAUTIONARY TALE, Jenna self-depreciatelingly tells all her weakest moments laying herself bare(figuratively and literally) to the reader. Yet reading her story I was struck with her strengh. Love her, hate her or indifferent anyone reading this has to credit her with an incredible fortitude overcoming trauma, heart-ache, and self-destructive tendencies to be where she is today. A few times in the autobiography Jenna patted herself on the back with her intelligence. I tend to agree she is one very smart lady as shown by the fact that Jenna had a goal from early on in her career and reached that goal with little outside help. (With the exception latterly of her husband.) Agree or disagree with her occupational choice but intelligent people would be hard pressed to argue with her brains. Therefore concluding this autobiography I felt an admiration for Jenna the person instead of Jenna the star.    Jenna the Writer: Here is what tripped me up reading this book. Turning the pages, and my eyes falling on particular deliscious turns of phrase I wondered who deserves the credit. Jenna, admittedly a bright girl for her survival and accomplichments, or her collaborator Neil Strauss. Finally finishing it hit me, the majority of authorship is irrelevent because throughout the text Ms. Jameson's ne: Mazorelli voice shouts at the audience to be heard. Her tone sets the standard, with her story coloured with a distinctly Jenna wit, humour and insight. Neil Strauss may have polished it up and acted as dream collaborator, but this is Jenna's story. It is in turns touching, funny, and sad but moving. The one minor warning is that when I read the first two chapters I was getting really into the tale, then the continuity seemed interrupted by humourous cartoons etc... however I quickly adjusted to this and learned to appreciate it.	2004-10-04

He chronicles the history of forensic science in crime investigation from the time of Doyle and his fictional Sherlock Holmes, albeit briefly, until the present day. Jackson focuses on a particular group that have modestly changed the face of criminal investigation. NECROSEARCH INTERNATIONAL, a group of criminalists, archaeologists, anthropologists, naturalists, paleotologists and many other ists and isms;).<br /><br />The group was founded in the late eighties and early nineties (although their roots as told by Jackson stretch even further back than that.) experimenting at locating pigs and corpses. From Project PIG NECROSEARCh emerged as an team utilized by investigative agencies throughout the world.<br /><br />Jackson focuses on three cases that have been a few examples of Necrosearch's successes. He writes the groups and victim's stories with such passion and empathy that it is almost like reading a thriller except these are real cases. That is to say this is a very readable true crime book that should appeal to armchair detectives, scientists, and people like myself ( and I am guessing from ratings there are a few) who are CSI fans.	2004-10-02

Hardly a surprise to a seasoned thriller reader like myself as the opening half of this novel reads almost like a novelized b-movie script. <br /> <br />Sanford Jamieson's lovely younger wife is tragically killed in an apparant hit and run one night on the Pacific Coast Highway. Suspecting her death was no accident, the billionaire out of love for his departed wife, and a yearning for the truth hires former L.A.P.D chief of Detectives Derek Cheney. Cheney retired from the force relatively young in the hopes he could lavish more attention on his beautiful wife Elizabeth, however when late hours for Elizabeth leaves Cheney unfulfilled he agrees to look into the matter for his wealthy neighbour. As Cheney delves deeper into the question of whether her death was an accident or murder his friend and protege, the current chief of detectives is wrapped up in a steamy relationship with a reporter Kimberly who wishes to cover the case. To further propel the plot someone is murdering aspiring actresses. <br /> <br />As mentioned this novel begins on a dubious note as far as quality is concerned. However as more and more of the mystery is uncovered Smoke deepens his characterization, and maintains the truthful dialogue. I felt myself compelled to read as the serial killer was unveiled about halfway through. Smoke pulls off a neat trick concerning this, the reader knows the killer without KNOWING the killer. The pace quickens as the plot as they say thickens and builds to an exciting climax and denouement. <br /> <br />As said no great surprise at Smoke's credentials as this reads like a movie and if hasn't been optioned I am surprised as to why. But Smoke's real talent in this title is not only building strong \\"real\\" characters with all the complications of common perople, but in slyly spoofing Hollywood and the cut-throat business of movies. As well he examines, inviting the reader to question with him love, fidelity, and betrayal. <br /> <br />This book is obviously far from perfect, but is a lot better than I expected.	2004-10-02

Partially because reading the back of the mass market paperback edition, whose synopsis does not provide any spoilers as much as a succinct synopsis of the plot and high praise. <br />Other reviewers have also summed up the plot, relieving me(unintentionally) I am sure of trying to add new tantalizing teasers to further acclaim this novel while providing plot elements. <br /> <br />Mr Michael Morano bravely and ethically introduces the story. In fact so inspiring is his introduction that my expectations of the novel skyrocketed into the tight orbit of implausiblity, only reading the introduction(not even the first chapter of actual tale yet) I became convinced no novel could deliver all that was promised. <br /> <br />Another brief digression while reading the first half, although I felt discomforted (as I am sure was Braunbeck's intent into exposing such a personal glimpse of tragedy), I felt I could put down the novel and did meaning to read other books until the feeling moved me to finish this one. Yet this past weekend I determined it would probably be in my own best interests to finish what I had started. If only because I hate leaving a book half finished unless it is so abysmal it would cost me my integrity to do so, which most assuredly was not the case here. <br />While slogging through the story a dam inside me burst open. His words on the pages seemed almost to blur by in a lyrical melody of fresh prose, while still underscored by the terrible themes. <br /> <br />Braunbeck's payoff adequately fulfilled my time investment reading his book which turned out to be an intensely gratifying reward. Everything Morano promised was true. So real was his conviction, I realized, that it only took me until halfway through the book to fall into that realization. <br /> <br />Braunbeck is not only a rising talent in the 21st century annals of horror, but he is also a visionary and inspiration to all readers, writers and writer wannabes.:)	2004-09-22

Readers' are soon introduced to Rack's partner \\"Bear\\" as it is in the opening pages that Rack is informed his daughter was brutally raped and murdered. <br /> <br />Skip forward a couple of chapters, in the interim of which Rack has had a chance to distribute his own justice as his brothers in law enforcement arrange a setting where Rack comes face to face with the killer, who implies another party resposible to the crime. Much to the chagrin of the deputies and marshals Tim braces to this unknown accomplice theory and spares the attacker's(Kindell) life. Then due to the unpredictablity of the justice system Kindell is set free.   <br /> <br />This miscarriage of justice sets the stage for Tim Rackley to become acquainted and join The Commission, a group of concerned citizens self-appointed to act as judge, jury and executioner for select cases the justice system has let slip through the cracks.  <br /> <br />Hurwitz seems to be setting a trend in his early writing career. Delving deep into the moral quigmire that make up humanity's conscience. In Do No Harm he wrote effectively about the thin lione in Medical professions ethical choices, and in this entry he turns his sights to the legal system. Paramount according to the back blurb about the author has already bought the option for this novel which surprises me not at all. Hurwitz paces the novel frantically with plenty of action and suspense. The characterization between Tim and Dray is excellent. As is the tension between members of the Commission foreshadowing the inevitable falling out. (That wasn't a spoiler as it pretty much is obvious from all other synoses.;))It reads like a novel screaming to head to Hollywood, yet it doesn't skimp on the deeper themes that is the heart of the story. This review would have been 5 stars my minor nit-pick being although Dray was brought to life well, her character could have been fkushed out even better. Otherwise a great summer read to peruse in any season.	2004-09-17

There are obvious paralells behind this premise and the historic shipping of England's criminals to Australia and New Zealand to establish penal colonies there. Bova isn't as extreme with the exiles characters, although there are some very complex and ambitious people populating the habitat and the book.  <br /> <br />Bova in fact seems to have expanded his own ambitions from writing an excellent hard science fiction novel with descriptive passages on the galaxy, and elaborate vocabulary to explain the physics and other relevent science scenes into a tome stretching to be a character based story that happens to be based on a habitat heading to the further corners of the galaxy into unexplored space. In this efort I credit Bova as being partially successful. It was interesting to see a real story driven plot behind his sci-fi. However the flip side of that is I got the impression reading through that Bova was trying to accomplish too much, in writing an exciting sci-fi yarn and a character study. For a character driven novel he didn't explore nearly deeply enough his principals, while they were not stereotypes they could have been even further fleshed out and perhaps provided a more enjoyable story or at least higher acclaim from Amazon armchair critics. <br /> <br />I have been a fan of Bova for some time now, not quite elevating him in my mental sci-fi hierarchy with Asimov, Clarke, or Herbert, but defintely as a second tier talent. His attempts to write a novel that expands his usual talents is both admired by me and a sign of optimism in that in his next novel he may have artisticully combined everything this novel lacked (and that wasn't much despite the starring and content of this review). <br /> <br />Saturn while underplayed as the title of this entry into Bova's series is still a very entertaining read that should appeal to the casual science fiction reader as much if not more than the hard-core science fiction fan.	2004-09-14

Being Canadian there may be debate about its relevence to my life. However the attacks of 9/11 impacted more than just Americans, it affected their Northern neighbours as well. <br />I then showed this to my manager whom is way more political than myself and he compared it to the Warren Commision and their report without even having read it. Well much as I respect de boss man I had to read this for myself. <br /> <br />The back summarizes and promises much, including the truth behind the events of 9/11, security measures proposed to prevent a similiar attack on American soil, and an update on the reworkings of the U.S. Intelligence community. <br /> <br />From the beginning I learnt much I had not known being an oh so casual observer of events from my lofty perch in Canada. I was unaware the bombing of The WTC in 1993 had such close ties to the eventual attacks on 9/11. I had been ignorant of much of Bin Ladens origins and how he managed to build the al Queda as a terrorist force to inspire well terror. <br /> <br />This book is written with a casual and effect relationship clear in mind and many findings are the results of an intense and often controversial investigation by the bi-partisan commission. <br /> <br />The proposals are reasonable, concise and only a little extreme when taken out of context. The commission is obviously first and foremost concerned with the truth, and then about protecting the States and instituting changes so they do not happen again. <br /> <br />Overall an educational tome even for an apolitical canuck like myself.	2004-09-13

Just when he feels happiness at the magical realm around him Kindred discovers where there is wonder there also can be great evil, placing his life in peril for reasons he can not even fathom. <br /> <br />Herbert is truly a wordmeister extraordinairre writing a modern fable/fairy tale must be a challenge to any author. He meets the challenge and surpasses it using his own obvious sense of wonder as templates for the setting and characters in this novel. This novel is as stated for adults as some of the descriptions are a little risque. Capital B but here though it is an adult tale that's main appeal is to reach the inner child inside all of us, if scaring us in the meantime that would be any horror novelists bonus I would think. <br /> <br />Some true horror affeciandoes may complain that it is not that scary a tale, I would debate that it is so excellently written I can skip the frights for one novel.	2004-09-10

This one revolving around ex-model/ex-ad exec Wolfgang Schmitt. Wolfgang is approached in his office with an invite to lunch with a co-worker, unsure if he is being propositioned or not he leaves the encounter with a promise of large changes to his life. Shortly thereafter he is invited to the estate of billionaire Nelson Scott. Scott in a bizarre twist of \\"Indecent Proposal\\" wishes Wolfgang to seduce his wife, thereby through legal means ensuring she is not valid recipient for his vast inheritance. <br /> <br />The plot summarized seems far-fetched, perhaps bordering on the outskirts of frommageville. Here Brooks again uses his penmanship and fluid prose style gracefully to render the plot vivid, compelling and charged with an electric undercurrent of erotism. <br /> <br />I am no English major but will go out on a limb and state boldly Brooks, while tipping his hat to the retiring Ms. Rice by numerous references throughout this novel to her works under her own name and the more risque A. N. Ba*(dunno spelling you know who I mean though:)), her penname, Brooks is also hinting a delicate irony in his Bait and Switch title. I state this because if you are familiar with Brooks's earlier novels either The SERPANT'S DANCE or DARKNESS BOUND, you may agree they were laced with enough eroticism to challenge the Beauty's series authoress's prowess. This novel while hot in its own right is more a smoldering heat as he (Brooks) subly teases the reader and entices them to turn the pages without the overt erotic charge of his other works. In this I say Bravo it is a subtlty and playfulness displayed by a maturing author just hitting his stride.	2004-09-07

Each chapter has a catchy title totally relevant to the topic covered. Additionally full colour illustrations of attractive couples demonstrating techniques etc add a nice visual without being graphic or obscene. <br /> <br />As to the content itself, the editors state in their positioning chapter that the Kamu Sutra covers almost every position under the sun etc and THE BIG BANG isn't going to rehash previously covered techniques. In other words it is not a book about trying to be an updated version of the classic text, but rather a guide in its own right with its own voice. It is a sexual primer advertised for the millenium (or least late nineties excuse my inaccuracy as my memory isn't perfect lol) and pretty much lives up to its own hype. <br /> <br />There is definitely a Generation X and later tone to the writing. Topics covered may in some cases make our parents blush as THE BIG BANG unflinchingly covers the gauntlet of sexual practices including foreplay, oral sex, intercourse, anal sex, sex toys... etc you get the picture. <br /> <br />One of the most important and impressive parts comes near the end however as it dedicates much space to STDs responsiblity, and contraception. <br /> <br />What seperates THE BIG BANG from other books on the subject is probably the overall flavor of the text liberally sprinkled with wit, humour and insight aimed at a younger audience as I say I would have to say it does a excellent job as a book for its target market while still appealing to old fogies looking for the occassional tip/pointer like myself.	2004-09-07

The BOOK of HIRAM is a sequel to the bestselling THE HIRAM KEY by Knight and Lomas. I point out that fact right away because in the interim the dynamic duo of authors have published several other titles such as THE SECOND MESSIAH, URIEL'S MACHINE, etc. Some of their works were more directly follow-up to THE HIRAM KEY than others, but fact is the whole reason for preambling my review with a pseudo-bibliography is to state I anxiously awaited a sequel to the HIRAM KEY. I loved that book, learning about freemasonry, ties to early Christianity and other fascinating topics. I eagerly bought THE BOOK OF HIRAM. These were after all authors I had in the past year and a half become very familiar with their writing style and research results, i.e. musings and theories put forth in their tomes as they tangentially thought about one mystery or another.<BR>Therefore it saddens me to baldly state I did not enjoy this title nearly as much as I thought I would.<BR>The authors continue with their religious/ritualistics questions and theories. Searching for further ancient ties to freemasonry in forgotten realms of antiquity. However by this time much of their writing is almost repetitive. In fact I counted too many footnotes that were self-referential. Apparantly most of the source material for this book was earlier titles written by the authors:O. Which led me to wonder if maybe their earlier success in the sales department spoiled them. Instead of searching for answers were they just milking previous success? Were their numerous footnotes subtle ads hinting at readers' to pick up any previously un-read titles put out by them? It was a little distracting and disappointing to have these thoughts as I tried to read what was as well written a book technically as any other Lomas/Knight book, even if their revelations and chapters were not nearly as interesting as in previous titles.<br />I finished this book not regreting reading it, only hoping it isn't quite a bestseller to spawn further sequels that further deteriotes the pleasure I had in reading THE HIRAM KEY.	2004-07-12

Although soon enough with some recent reviews I will have to skip the disclaimer I usually head them with about me not being a fantasy reader. <BR>I am selective, and it was the blurb on the back of this novel that sold me the book. <BR>Gavril Andral artist and sensitive young man living in sunny Smarma and painting a lovely princess. Her family of course looks on him with disdain and the opening gambit in this debut offering from Ash seems predictable. Except unbeknownst to Gavril right away he has royal blood in his veins as well as a dark legacy from his father Lord Drakhoun of Ankerhisk(sp)?. His father was murdered and his retainers kidnap Gavril as the heir to inherit his father's dark gifts and blood feuds with rival klans.<BR>This novel borrows much from Russian lore including some sounds of names and places and folklore/wisdom. It also borrows from such tones as the darkest fantasy, and if Ash continues in this vein I can see comparisions to Barker(though not as dark) but I was also reminded a little of King's Dark Tower.<BR>The action in the tale is a skilful mix of suspense, classic fantasy, mythology and horror. The plot moves quickly, and not even the preview of the second title in the trilogy saturated my appetite for more concerning the characters populating this magical land. Ash's best qaulity is a succinctness in providing enough detail without detracting from the story's excitement and thereby able to cut off her story in a trilogy as opposed to a tetralogy or longer series. I will probably end up reading them all more than once which for a non fantasy reader should be the seller;).	2004-07-05

Two tenacious cops are unwilling to let the cases close so patly as some would wish and investigate to discover the truth.<br />This novel is gritty, without being graphic, and while there are parts I suspected before the author revealed the plot twists I was kept guessing more than in many I have read in the genre.<br />This book zooms along while Yapolenter adds surprises, delves into her characters psyches and basically writes an excellent all around police proceedural thriller whose dialogue rings true and characters' motivations kept secret until the thrilling end.	2004-06-12

It involves writing a relatively lengthy tome on eyepieces, i.e. relracting/reflecting lenses, telescopes etc, without putting your audience to sleep.<BR>Admittedly I picked up this book due to a fascinating little blurb on the front and back cover. As I started reading it I worried, &quot;Oh no what have I gotten myself into?&quot;<BR>Well the answer to that rhetorical question relates to Temple's meeting and surpassing his challenge.<BR>The first few chapters focus almost exclusively on the Lanyard lens, an ancient lens much ado has revolved around in certain (reluctantly describe it as geeky) circles. Temple then tracks the science of lenscraft from ancient times to present. Along the way to keep his book from becoming as dry as the Sahara he digresses on historical topics and scientific biographies of lumenaries such as Copernicus, Galileo, Newton and others.<br />One of the most impressive aspects to this work for me a layperson with limited interest in subject matter were the endnotes following each chapter, themselves interesting and complete. These notes are a reflection (pun intended) on how commited Temple was to this project and in my eyes he met with much success.	2004-06-08

Reading the quotes acclaiming what a huge talent that has arrived in the horror genre put an unfair pressure on this novel before I even began reading it.<BR>The tale(maccabre of course) of a small town in Colorado and the angst and pain of new citizen and high school student Mark Howell who at the beginning is slightly overweight to fit in is a creppy story well-told.<BR>Moore foreshadows the psychological as well as physical changed being worked on Mark quite well. His supporting cast of characters while not fully flushed out are not 2 dimensional stereotypes or caractitures either. The bully grows with the narrative and Moore allows his character to evolve during the story, for which he deserves much credit. <BR>In fact he did many things well in this novel, and there were echoes of King in the writing making the comparision not completely unsuitable. However his length and the fact that this novel could have been much scarier forced me to give it three stars in my humble review. An excellent effort with room to improve.	2004-06-08

So much so in fact that they quested to trace the genealogical roots of the two kings Arthur. They trace the Welsh Kings' origins from Caesar's invasion through the unstable Roman occupation through to Britain's medieval history. <br />Gilbert's first person voice is welcome as he describes the research and archaelogical work done to discover the man/men behind the myth. He brings the reader with him to sites of Arthur's fortress kingdom and grave. <br />Some reviewers have expressed disdain for the research and theories documented inside the book myself I am not knowledgable enough in the subject area to dispute any facts offered. Instead I enjoyed learning a part of history not nearly documented enough in spite of the obvious interest. I am sure I am not alone in stating Arthurian Legend fascinates me and the fact that this is more than a &quot;documentary&quot; look at the Once and Future King is a recommendation in itself.<br />Gilbert and his co-authors covered a varied and dense period in Britain in a very accessible and exciting text not only delivering on promise of tracing Arthur's roots but also springing some surprises on the lucky person interested enough to read this book.	2004-05-28

It is rare enough that I read fantasy this title virtually leaped out at me.<br />Fantasy as a genre is almost synonomous with myth, typically it is penned with a population of elves, humans, perhaps dragons and other real and surreal denizens. Often the main character is therefore almost mythologically heroic (why since most myths are based on all too human anti-heroes including their Gods is beyond my ken). Of course the whole statement above depends on two elements for any to agree with me, one that you believe their is mythlogical roots to most fantasies and two Heroes of fantasies are almost too lily white good.<br />Both premises are tossed out the window in this novel at least so far as Ballas is the plot's focus. Ballas is charitably drawn as a noggodnik, bum and vagrant with violent habits, many vices and few virtues.<br />Ballas steals a gem-studded disc and proceeds to run for his life from the theocratic rulers of the land as a result.<br />Monument is not neccessarily a 21st century morality tale as it is the grittiest fantasy I have read. Almost a fantasy-nior as opposed to crime-noir but Graham's writing is strong and he allows Ballas to evolve enough over the course of his adventure without bailing out on the basic dark essence of who Ballas is, a very nasty little title that I suspect has already influenced the field of fantasy infusing fresh blood (literaly and figuratively) into a genre that has at least in my opinion started to become almost redundant in plots, this is indeed very fresh indeed.	2004-05-25

It has no bells and whistles, but instead relies on sound technical soundness, strong characterization, and a well paced plot. If I taught a contemporary English-Horror class to young people I might add this to curriculum.<br />The story isn't Terribly original but Hynd tells it well, adding a creepy feel to his themes of love, responsibilty hubris etc...<br />This is by far not my favourite horror novel of all time or even ghost story for that matter, but I did enjoy it and as I said if nothing else it is good to read &quot;meat n potatoes&quot; kinda writing in a field sometimes overwhelmed by hacks that forget the basics of good storytelling.	2004-05-12

I hope I don't lower the average stars given this novel by writing this review, and rating it only three stars. <BR>Benson's formula(?), I say formula only because she has written two previous novels with chronological setting shifting betwixt present and past before this one has been slightly altered with this offering. Instead of a &quot;medical&quot; thriller, Ms. Benson has opted to write mystery/thrillers using am L.A. police detective, and a fifteenth century nun as her protagonists.<br />Reading this the two heroines are not as dissimiliar as one may expect. Lany Dunbar though not specifically stated has some very classic christian values to her character. Mere Guillemette le Drappiere, while a respected nun and confidante/aide to the bishop of Nantes was not always a nunm and has some very pragmatic and secular values leftover before her life of service. One thing both ladies have in common is their passion to solve the mysterious disappearances of young children.<br />As I said in title of review this book is very good, Benson seamlessly parallels the eras the action of her novel is set in. She writes with a meticulate attention to her chief characters' motives and humanity. <br />There is only a couple flaws that bugged me very slightly as I read this book but I feel they are worth mentioning for the integrity of this review. 1) One reason I read this is the back blurb sounded really interesting setting half the novel in 1440 Nantes around &quot;Bluebeard's&quot; or Lord Giles de Rais's crimes hooked my jaded attention span. However while Benson gave equal &quot;screen&quot; teehee book i mean time to 1440 Nantes, I felt she could have characterized de Rais a little deeper. Until his trial he was like a phantasm mists of a character(perhaps intentional to further the plot), but if he is a draw to readers like myself I felt I would have liked to get inside his head more so to speak. 2.) This novel is probably longer than it could/should be, again another confession I skimmed about a hundred of the 600+ pages, because although it was entertaining and enjoyable it wasn't Great enough for me to self-justify reading every single word in the massive text.<BR>Everyone's taste is different and this is the reason I can consciously recommend this title to others. While I felt it was long and dragged a little for readers of Benson, and readers that enjoy historical/contemporary fiction this could be the title you are looking for.:)	2004-04-29

However my patience did wane slightly wondering if they were ever going to cover the topics described on the back cover, or for that matter further discuss some of the societys mentioned earlier in this book or in their other title.<br />They finally do return to topics and themes readers familiar to this effusive collaboration have grown accustomed to, and in my opinion fulfill the promises made by their potential and the hype their works have accredited.<br />This volume I must confess I found overall less interesting, possibly because while the authors haven't become apologetic or revoked their earlier research they didn't add more controversy to their titles. Baigent and his co-author's aren't accused of towing the party line but only recovered the earlier revelations/theories without much expansion which I think was the only really hurtful factor to my enjoyment of this book.	2004-04-29

I bring this up because some authors write in a genre very well and experiment or cross over to another genre and even if the story is as strong are not as successful in their second writing category. Even master Stephen King's Dark Tower series where he moves easily from his renown horror tales to dark fantasy isn't as critically or popularly acclaimed as his other books. Mattheson moved his horrific prose into an old west setting gracefully and smoothly. He uses the same economy of words to tell the story of Marshall Halser, who not much of a plot spoiler to add gets shot in opening chapters.<br />The narrotor is Halser not from beyond the grave per se but in the form of his journals in the hands of a friend and journalist who wishes to publicize them to seperate myth from man.  As I said Mattheson is spare in his writing not using five pages of details where one will do, instead he writes a tight plot making this a quick fun read.<br />Incidentally it won the 1991 Spur award so my praise of his genre transition is a little redundant hehehe.	2004-04-20

A friend ordered this book and I laughed, then when my used bookstore recieved a copy I decided to check it out. I am glad I did. <br />The first few chapters are very explicit as Xaviera details her blossoming as a young nymphomaniac and describes many lurid sexual activities. Then the writing describes more or less her transformation into a prostitute high priced call girl (considering the times) and madam.  Xaviera Hollander may be the happy hooker but she smashes the sterotypes by being an educated, intelligent and artitulate narrator.<br />This book is written with two other people, and that I confess is main reason I didn't give it five stars. While it is no doubt in Xaviera's own words reading it sub-consciously I did wonder how edited the text was. At times I felt her collaboraters did an almost too fine a job polishing the narrative much like some songs can be over-produced my over-all impression of this work was one of over-production.<br />That said it is a honest memoir that does not glorify the profession or gloss over life's uglier incidents and sides, in short a detailed life of a lady suited to be a madam due to her love of sex and the circumstances of life. An entertaining and yes informative book.	2004-04-20

Dear Sir/Madam<br />Time and other factors forego me to summarize the plot of this most excellent mystery, others have summed up the goings on quite well, so you probably have no need for another capsule of the action.<br />I write with one request. Please read this mystery by the gentleman and man of letters Tony Strong. He returned to his character of Terry Williams who appeared in his previous novel THE POISON TREE, further breathing life into the scholar in the highlands of Scotland. A setting quite suitable for the paranoia and withhunts which permeate this tale. All of his characters are fully alive to the sensitive readerm be they contemporary's of Ms. Williams' or ancestors burnt at the stake for either witchcraft, or sexual deviation (i.e. homosexuality/lesbianism). I can almost smell the rain and fog blanketing the small village this book is set in as Williams as a researcher, and her wiccan friends who have been falsely accused try to solve the murder of a young lady who briefly practiced in the wiccan coven.<br />Besides characterization and atmospere though, the strongest factor in my wholehearted recomendation of this work is Mr. Strong's writing. It is clean and very technically sound as he builds suspense without sacrificing realism or grammar. An excellent mystery that kept me guessing right until the final chapters.	2004-04-15

My fear had little to do with its harrowing plot (eerie as it is), and everything to do with my thought process which went; &quot;Oh no 300+ pages of disaster novel peachy&quot;. Beauseigneur made me forget my initial impression soon into his second entry into the series allaying my anxiety that it would be nothing but another long apocolyptic narrative that had been done time and again in fiction. <br />While continuing to chronicle Christopher's career, and detail Decker Hawthorne's life after the disaster the author neatly parralels the story of Revelation in his novel, and even footnotes specific passages significant to the story line. This is not just one long disaster novel though his prose is too fluid so that another fictionalization of Revelation is lifted up into a suspenseful, gripping novel.<br />Parts of the plot are a little predictable as is inevitable for any reader with a passing knowledge of the bible, but Beauseigneur manages to keep the reader guessing with unexpected plot twists.<br />The author has included an explanatory note to both volumes, explaining that this is FICTION and happenings in the author's imagination, which should be kept in mind while reading this book. I wouldn't call it blashemous or heritical because it is a novel after all and if there are serious Christians reading this please remember the note at start of books. His explanation of the origins of humanity and speculation of who Christ the Messiah and Yahweh are seem a little far fetched at first but as I continued reading I found them plausible and entertaining as I am sure they were meant to be and this ending building up to the third and climatic volume is what clinched this books worthiness as a second entry in series.<BR>This &quot;Christ Clone Trilogy&quot; I have to recommend to all, you may not find it to your tastes but I highly regret anyone who enjoys reading would regret taking the time to read this trilogy.	2004-04-10

Logistically some may argue that even Classic tales like Dracula had a sensuous sub-text, but the main thrust was to scare.<br />Michael Ceccilone has adapted admirably penning a vampire novel for the late twentieth/early twenty-first century.<br />Cassandra Hall is a sensitive window designer/would be poet when she meets the enigmatic Julien. Her fate is thereafter inevitable as this handsome stranger leads her through an erotic path of self-discovery, ending in her transformation to a vampire. Cassandra is hunted by two groups who would like her dead, a witch-hunting puritan group of humans and a vampire tribunal responsible for the species justice.<br />Cecilione changes narratives from present to past smoothly and gracefully as he tells Cassandra's story. His writes skillfully as he explains her origins and keeps readers' on the edge of their metaphorical seats wondering how his novel will end.<br />In addition Cecilione adds some metapysical and philosophical musings through his lead characters, blending this with an almost sado-mascicistic description of humamity's basest desires making this reviewer wonder if he might not have been channeling de Sade as he wrote. All in all an excellent vampire tale with lots more than biting fiends and stakes.	2004-04-03

White retells the Arthurian legend yet again. However it is obvious that his intent is not to supplant Mallory's Classic (This tome by the way is a classic in itself but I digress.) <BR>One of the main obstacles I feel White overcame is adding his own wit and humor to a story that is as tragic as it is legendary. <BR>White's finest moments of story-telling is his characterization of the mighty Merlin, making him almost a piece of comic relief without painting him with irreverence. In fact Arthur, Gwynervere, Lancelot, and the other assorted peoples of Camelot all live and breathe as if White was recording history/biography instead of writing a novel.<br />The couple small critiques I have with this epic is its length (of course might not be epic if it was cut shorter), I feel White detailed a few more minor incidents too thoroughly and didn't detail others enough, course as he explains the scenes he glossed over could be found in Mallory's text. HEHE actually those are both my complaints in one pseudo paragraph, I would have liked more Arthur and less of some other characters, otherwise this is a book I will read again and again and probably gain new insights etc... with each perusal.	2004-04-03

It is sooooo brilliantly plotted a &quot;blurb&quot; can not do the book justice especially without using spoilers which may ruin it for those that haven't read it yat.<BR>2.) This is a thriller with an electric intense plot true enough yet it is the other elements of Braver's novel which elevates it above the average suspense thriller.<br />Not only is the premise of this book fresh and relevent, but it touches on issues that make the reader think as opposed to turning pages rabidly to find out if the good guys win in the end. Mainly because it is not a &quot;white hats vs. black hats&quot; thriller. Sure compassionate readers' root for the Whitmans (Dylan's family) but they are not neccessarily &quot;heroes&quot;. <BR>Braver offers social commentary on top of his plot and themes he throws in sidebars on suicide rates of people who didn't do as well as expected on SATs and sets scenes of little league soccer games as another example of the pressures youth in the twenty-first century face to excel. Tess Gerritson called this title &quot;thought-provoking and controversial&quot; and I have to agree whole heartedly with both those assessments.	2004-04-03

Meanwhile in Rome his enemies the boni seduce his former colleague Pompeius Magnus (Pompey) after the death of Caesar's daughter and Pompey's wife dissolves their familial and political connections. <BR>McCullough, if nothing else breathes live into the ancient Romans that populate her series. Throughout reading these books I almost felt as if I stood beside such greats as Cicero, Pompey, Cato and of course Caesar as her characters renacted ancient history. This must be a challenging thing to do, as she herself stated her subject matter hadn't been written to death by previous authors, so she had to really research to write credibly. Ms. McCullough succeeded as far as I am concerned, painting the crossing of the Rubicon with the splendour history suggests it deserves, and bringing Caesar from legend into this entertaining tome.	2004-03-06

By now I am quite familiar with Lomas's and Knight's writing strengths and weaknesses. Reading Uriel's Machine therefore was untainted pleasure.<br />Knight and Lomas theorize that the Great Flood did in fact occur, and moreover was the cataclysmic event in scientific civilization. They believe that prehistoric people's were more advanced than previously thought, and science at least of astronomy originated with them.<br />This whole work is one archeological detective story as they lead readers to stonehenge and other megolithic sites in Ireland, Wales, and England.<br />They cover an enormous amount of theories and legends, including the Biblical Enoch, and Watchers. In fact sometimes reading I forgot what the central argument/thesis they put forth was, this duo has a mild tendency to digress, (usually to some connection with freemasonry), but as I stated I have adapted to this writing style and read on soaking up the knowledge they splashed across the pages.<br />Each chapter concludes with a conclusion(like d'uh eh haha), which is a handy synopsis of all the points they made in the chapter chiseled down to their bare bones.<br />This is another title by these authors I found intriquing, fascinating and educational. Want to investigate the ancient roots of science? Read this title.	2004-03-04

Now I am reviewing the novel, not other reviews, but felt it neccessary to say one thing. It looked like the biggest complaint was this title's lack of originality. Luis Jorges Borges believed everything has been written, and to an extent I agree. It is incrasingly hard for an author to imagine a completely original plot. Especially when the themes are like those dealt with in this novel, i.e. family, roots, betrayal, and the angst of being a teenager.<br />Meg Mckenna leads a seemingly charmed life, attending a posh private school, soon to inherit her grandfather's legacy, and being popular. In fact the only minor things marring her almost perfect existance is a strenous relationship with her step-sister and father.<br />Candra grew up with her &quot;grandmother&quot; in Jamaica, slaving away for a prosperous family, forever snubbed and impoverished. Until the family her grandmother is working for moves back Stateside, and Candra believes this country is the land of dreams come true where she can change her life.  The price she is willing to pay to improve her lot seems infinite, including dabbling in black arts.<br />This story seems pretty allegorical as I read along I realized that it stood at least in part for many archetypes(which I am not going to interpret in fear it will spoil the plot.)<br />There were times I felt I was reading a melodramatic cliche, but Morgan's pacing and characterization overcame that minor flaw. I was especially impressed with Morgan's grasp of teenage cruelty, and the alienation that modern teenagers feel.<br />I thought this was a quick fun read, I haven't read the Bujold title, but will. Even if this wasn't Totally oringinal I enjoyed it and hope you do too.	2004-03-04

I read this title determined if I chose to review it on Amazon(which I have), I would put all my effort into not letting my bias reflect into my review. <BR>I started this book months ago before throwing it away in disgust... I got as far as 20 pages or so and justified putting it aside as saying their premise didn't offend my faith, I just had trouble stomaching that much sophistry. The authors boldly put forth their thesis and withing 20 pages I saw at least 3 errors in their reasoning, and further compounding this was the sloppy way they contradicted statements, perhaps hoping to confuse the reader enough to convince them of their rightness with smoke and mirrors.<BR>Then this week I needed something &quot;interesting and non-fictional&quot; to read, and gave this book another shot.<BR>I can not say I am glad I read this book, I can not say I regret the time spent reading it. The fact is the authors have some interesting theories, and are presumably knowledgeable where they speak of pagan beliefs and rituals. I learnt much reading this so I can not say it is a bad book or a poorly written book (though there are parts where one almost could say it was poorly written). My main &quot;beef&quot; if you will is uneveness throughout. There are times when it seems the authors are researching deep into the subject seeking answers to pertinant question and scholarly giving in-depth helpful foot notes. Then there are parts when I thought they had jumped to their conclusions long before writing and searched desperately with any source to call upon to back up their claims.<br />&quot;Get off the fence!&quot; You yell, is this review a recomendation of the book or a pan? I can only suggest that if anyone is interested in specualation of Jesus and wonders about other pagan rites and philosophies they read this with a grain of salt.

Gracious readers' of my various reviews must start to feel like confessors. I say this with tongue just half in cheek because it seems like some of my recent reviews have started with confessions haha. I confess this tome took me a while to finish. That was due to subjective reasons however and in no way is a reflection of Volger's work. In this resource/book Volger draws heavily on Joseph Campbell's THE POWER of MYTH so further his analogy that writing no matter what the medium is deeply indebted to Myths and archetypes. He then proceeds to define some common archetypal characters found in stage, screen, and in fiction. After presenting in layperson's terms the various archetypes found in these mediums Volgel then places them in context as how useful they are as tools to the aspiring writer and provides examples from classic and contemporary sources.<br />As I confessed this wasn't a breeze to read as far as I am concerned, in fact it uncharacteristically took me months to finish. This is not because Volger's book or journey was dry or pedantic, rather each unit or chapter was written to invite reflection, and for the really motivated exercises. I nibbled pieces of this rich offering happily allowing each chapter to be digested until I read more.<br />I am an aspiring writer(unpublished but hopefully not eternally unpublished teehee), yet am too subjective to state unequivicably rather this title helps me my writing, although I suspect it is inevitable that it will. I can say without doubt that reading Vogel's Writer's Journey I am a more enriched and discerning reader of other's fiction/plays/screenplays. <br />One last tidbit, although I have said Vogel refers to Campbell's THE POWER of MYTH frequently,in fact so much so that is in my TBR pile in VERY near future, that book is not a prerequisite for a fulfilling understanding of this one.<br />THE WRITERS JOURNEY is a trip that is infinite in page numbers but infinite in scope as far as its resourcefulness and prose goes. Don't want to end review with bad sentence structures hahar but oh well.	2004-02-23

The pacing is amazing and Hamilton writes the L.A. youth with remarkable skill. <BR>Overall an excellent second entry into the Eve Diamond Mythos.	2004-02-21

With apologies to Mr. Wells I am afraid I do not have a time machine. However I have the next best thing, this novel by Gray. John MacLachlan Gray will guide you to the Falcon employer of correspondant Edmund Whitty, a sometimes down on his luck opium eater investigating the murders of &quot;fallen women&quot; on behalf of the Falcon. The prime suspect William Ryan dubbed The fiend in human form, Chokee Bill, by Whitty claims innocence. Gray during the ongoing drama will lead you to rat fights and public houses, guiding you through the gas lit streets of London circa 1852.<br />The above is an inadequate attempt to provide a glimmer of the atmosphere that permeates this thriller, much like the smoggy streets I almost felt I was walking as I read this incredible tale. Carr's The Alienist was proclaimed by many as an astute historical thriller, upon which many have tried to emulate. Yet the scenery, and dialogue in this story even sets the tension through which the narrative moves in THE FIEND IN HUMAN in a time and place that is almost plausible that Gray actually visited such is his powers of story telling.<br />The characters are consitent with the setting and I could envision myself looking over the shoulders of Dorcas and Phoebe(two supporting characters) as they pickpocketed the unwary to help support their family in the slums.<br />Have I praised this book enough yet? Hardly all I can say again is reading this is the closest anyone can come to a virtual tour of Victorian London until technology provides an alternative to the literary skills of Gray.	2004-02-18

A family moves into their dream house to live an idylic existence in the country. Of course it being in the horror genre this doesn't happen, as their place seems haunted.<br />I said it was obstensibly a ghost story because reading it and thinking back, looking for inspiration for this review I would be just as apt to label it a sociological novel studying the nuclear family of the 21st century. The step-mother and daughter have a strained relationship loaded with friction, the 14(or 15) year old daughter Emily has a barely tolerated relationship with her little brother. The father toils away at a law firm trying to reconcile work and family. If Matthews had given Brenda a career(or implied more detail and described it more) I would have tried to figure out how many families in North America were pretty much excatly as this one is imagined. Two things can happen when parents re-marry and raise a step family, either they gel and cohere in a familiar unit or they break apart at the seams. Matthews does an exceptional job keeping the reader wondering which side of the tight-rope this family is going to land on as he heaps adversity after adversity on them, and relentlessly twists and turns the plot so I don't think anyone can forsee how this one is going to end. Very well done, hopefully Matthew's writing quality remains at this obvious peak in future novels.	2004-02-17

His fiancee an archeologist goes to further investigate Mars on the eve of his proposal, but he soon finds himself reunited with her planetside.<br />Balfour's science fiction offering is a brilliant balance of plot and characterization. He seemingly effortlessly weaves plots and sub-plots tightly together, without sacrificing other aspects (again i.e. characterization) to his crisp exciting story. In fact I have mentioned characterization twice because his main hero bears a striking similiarity to Bova's protaganist in his Mars epic. Either this reflection in having strong Native American male character's in two Mars novels is a coincidence, or Balfour is paying a nice tribute to Bova. The similarities pretty much stop there though as Balfour's novel is as original as another title on the red planet could be, interspersed with delightful scenes of intrique and human drama. This is a title I just recently finished, but am almost already craving re-reading.	2004-02-17

This is reputedly Jung's last project/publication before his death in 1961 and is an excellent primer and synopsis of his work in the field. Jung edited this book and wrote the first chapter on the importance of symbols before unleashing writings from his students/protegees. <BR>As a whole this book covers an incredible array of subjects, relating in layperson's terms the importance of symbols in the unconscious, the role of the unconscious through dreams in communicating these symbols to the analsand and analyst. I believe Jaffe, though could stand corrected examines various motifs and symbols synthesising the previous works into an observation of Jung's theories on the collective unconscious and its influence on individuals and the process of individuation.<BR>This is as I said an excellent primer because although it is a good text for those taking psych 101(I am excluded from this group so don't know if it is text, but could/should be), it is written with a clarity that carries a universal appeal, making it recommended reading for anyone who wishes to understand psychology better and more important perhaps anyone who wishes to understand themselves better without resorting to new agey dream dictionaries.	2004-02-17

The rest of the population have become vampires.<br />Matheson writes an incredibly exciting and compelling tale of vampirism. The action is continous throughout the short novel, and he offers alternative theories to the mythology. I still lay awake 48 hours after finishing it that is testament to how spooky the atmosphere permeating this story is, and I am a jaded horror reader. There is little gore in Matheson's horror, but great suspense/paranoia and a chilling climate compelling readers' to turn pages at furious page until the superb ending.<br />This novel is a must read for fans of the Vampire sub-genre horror fiction.	2004-02-13

Then she accidentally killed an abusive mother and unofficially adopted her daughter and fleed to Miami. Jane/Dolores live a pretty contented (if uncomplicated) life until a series of ritualistic murders reveals that her husband is on her tail.<BR>Michael Gruber's prose is indeed very lush, ( I always wondered what reviewers meant when they said that until I read this debut thriller.) The descriptions of settings, the research into the Miami Cuban culture and various tribes in Africa and Siberia make this title hum with a vivid life that grips the reader until they turn the last page. Gruber is acclaimed as a fresh talent in the genre and after finishing this book in just over 24 hours I have to agree. His narration jumps from first person to third, which is smooth enough that it doesn't affect the overall story in a negative way, yet rather enhances it. He then add another narration within a narration by including excerpts of Jane Doe's anthropological journals. Phew as if this tale wouldn't be exciting enough without all these added touchs of flare. All I can say is I eagerly anticipate more fiction from this novelist.	2004-02-12

The only one who seems to believe Boyd's innocence is his campaign manager who is determined to convince Cady to stop his investigation. Cady being a person of integrity wants to do his job, but starts to suspect he is being used when Boyd suddenly dies.<BR>If this novel was a road I would sure hate to drive it, as there are more twists and turns then I can count. Topol breathes life into all his characters and does a more than good job paralelling the campaigns in Japan and the States. Even though the reader has a fairly good idea who the &quot;villian/mastermind&quot; behind the conspiracy is Topol supplies enough suspense to keep the reader entertained until the climax.  He weaves his tale with an excellent atmosphere of paranoia worthy of the X-Files, and that alone to me is worth 4 stars for this fun title.	2004-02-04

There is some of Flaubert's style and grace in this work at any rate and the fact he is mentioned in La Bas, The Damned makes me believe he was an influence on the author's literary career. Another influence strongly prevalant throughout is Hermetic thought andschool of philosophy both explicity, and implicitly. The protaganists friend is given the nom de plume of de Hermies(hmmmm). Not to start reviewing other reviewers words, but in order to not be repetive, so perusers of this review aren't going didn't I just read that I will limit myself to say other reviews make salient points i.e. shallowness of characterization, and the fact that to a jaded 21st century reader this book isn't that erotic or shocking.<BR>Huysmans shows real genius though as I started to say above, before I digressed in the marriage of styles and influences. Besides the harmonious resonance of hermeticism prominant in the text the is an almost gothic romance undertone as well as other styles and themes making this a quite intelligent, and poetic novel.	2004-02-04

It isn't it is a companion piece I would say focusing primarily on the character of Bean. Card tells his origins on the streets, and how he found himself in the Battle School. It also though focuses on not only secondary character's but on Ender's universe in a much more macroscopic way. In 'GAME, the primary setting was the actual battle school, and Ender's immediate environs. In 'SHADOW however the reader is given not only a larger geographic scope to enjoy, but also a grander geopolitical, socioeconomic context for the overall story.<br />I imagine it wouldn't be easy returning to a world so admired and imitated after fifteen years and numerous novels, but Card does so with grace and aplumb. Shadow may have been written immediately after Game except for the clear sense of Card's evolution of a novel displayed in the latter title. I raved about Ender's Game in one of my reviews, so naturally had high expectations for this paralell/paralax tale, and wasn't disappointed.	2004-01-31

Then answer yes, but the title states this novel is original?&quot; There is the nub, so to speak, this serial killer was oringinally a nasty soul, Paul Noakes in eighteenth century England, and an imprisoned convict Myron. In other words this particular killer has been reincarnated several times to kill and kill again.<BR>        That is the main premise that distinguishes this good guys vs. bad guy novel from all the others on the market. Hart has interspersed her plot with subplots including domestic tension as the wife of the lead investigator is revealed to be having an affiar with his supervisor.<BR>       There is room for even more, Hart valiantly, often succeeding to bring characterization and life to the population of this story. In the main part as stated she succeeds, yet it is almost as if she has spread herself too thin. Trying to say too much in a pared down novel. In other words this tale would have been just as enjoyable if she had made it twice as long. The agents lives are glimpsed as is the killer's various incarnations, yet it is almost as if the reader is seeing them through the window of a bus passing hurriedly through town, without stopping even to make a pit stop. So the lack of depth in some ways hurts her unexpected ending and overall diminishes her otherwise taut and effective writing.	2004-01-27

It contains writings from his contemporaries in the genre, other horror novelists, editors and critics.<BR>This book made me an even bigger fan of the author. Reading his peers' critiques provided me with an insight, and vaster appreciation for what King has done in the field. One critic even hailed him as the best horror writer of all time. I agree with that assessment although it is debatable even in this collection, he is definitely the best-selling horror writer and as the essays detail there is good reason for that.<BR>Some may be put off by a few of the obviously gushing tributes paid to King by those in the industry, but I feel him worthy of the high praise.<BR>And lest anyone come across this tome and get the impression it is a schmooze fest there are some very critical and uncomplimentary comments included.<BR>King has achieved such high acclaim that my one complaint is there hasn't been a follow-up publication released essaying his more recent works and how he has evolved from a schlock/horror writer into an author that chronicles an era with poignency and insight.	2004-01-23

What do people often do if they recieve letters dumping them, and breaking their hearts? Especially if they are young sensitive English majors like Logan? Well go for a walk of course. Except in a Richard Laymon novel lots of nasty people/things await in the dark, even in a Univeristy town such as Wilmington. Luckily Logan's October is less lonesome thanks to nubile young ladies such as Casey (the mysterious woman he follows,) and Elaine (mutual friend of his and Holly's). Unfortunately there are evil trolls and people in the dark October night as well as nubile young women.<BR>This story is classic Laymon and contains all the ingredients of some of his best novels: Sensuality/sexuality by the truckload, high quoatiant of suspense and terror, and likable characters.<BR>As with some of his best work there is a degree of ambigouity as to the true nature(supernatural) of the evil in this tale. Laymon aptly demonstrates that humans can be as souless and cruel as any troll or vampire. Laymon again plots his novel with a fast pace, making me at least wish I hadn't finished it as quickly as I did.	2004-01-19

Skimming some of my fellow Amazonians' reviews I couldn't help but wonder if I was at an advantage with this title. The third novel featuring FBI agent Maggie O'Dell was my introduction to both her character and the writing of Alex Kava, so I went in, and came out of this read with no frames of reference to compare SOUL CATCHER with, so I couldn't be disappointed.<BR>Maggie O'Dell is brought into a case when a senator's body if found after a religious rally by the enigmatic Father Everett. Her partner Tully, friend Dr. Gwen Patterson and herself investigate the connection between the murder(which looks like it was done by a serial killer) and an FBI raid on a religious cabin that went south.<BR>I admit I wasn't planning to review this novel as I read so many thrillers that generally (with an exception or two) I won't post review on Amazon unless they are exceptional and I feel I can recommend them to Amazon reading public. Kava drew me into her plot and characters though as I read this novel. I started to feel for Maggie, and rooting for her and her colleagues against the killer. Kava kept the plot's momentum moving with the speed of a lost soul speeding towards the light at the end of the tunnel. The suspense builds towards the climax which I am afraid is a little anti-climatic which is one of the flaws I found with this book.<BR>Is it exceptional? No Kava's writing style seems very straight ahead minus bells and whistles, but she builds characterization into her novel well, so I would recommend this book, maybe not as strongly as some others in the genre I have read but as a fun quick read with a tight plot and likable characters.	2004-01-18

If you want to be titilated I suggest you read novels by erotic authors, yet there are passages that are just graphic enough they pique the senses.<BR>Talese opens his book with a description of an early starlet of Playboy, then proceeds with a short biography of Hugh Hefner. In the opening chapters alone I learnt much about the struggles against vice squads and censorship groups publishers like Hefner faced as they struggled to bring entertainment to a male audience. Then Talese shifts gears a little reporting on a group of people who live a swinging/mate swapping lifestyle. <BR>Talese reports everything in a very objective sense, yet the reader can't help but feel he has some connection with his subject matter. There is a distinct sense of wonder and interest in his reporting style. <BR>I have read reviews claiming this was a dated work, which I can not debate it being published in the early eighties, BUT that doesn't take anything away with the interest this book held for me or the fascination I felt reading about Bullero and the Williamson's as they founded a commune for free love. Fact of the matter is in the 21st century every book on sexuality is going to be a little dated by the time of its publication, so if you don't focus on that but rather read THY NEIGHBOUR\\"S wife as a history and tale about a nation's sexual revolution, as a text if you will on emotional and sensual freedom and its roots I predict you may find this tome as enjoyable as I have.:)	2004-01-18

She pilots a superluminal to the farthest regions of known and unknown space, with a group of people desperately in search for further proof of extraterristial life. &quot;The Contact Society&quot;, is mocked by real scientists, yet the affluent group's zeal for their mission is untainted by skeptism, or sarcasm, even when their quest costs lives.<BR>Chindi is a term for spirit, or ethereal presence in this novel, and the namesake fits the vessal. Mcdevitt guides readers' to wondrous descriptions and incredible vistas of space as he creates alien worlds and beings. He has been compared to such luminaries in the field as Clarke and Asimov, by many fans and critics alike including no less a personage than Stephen King. There are some obvious parallels to Clarke and Lee's Rama series. The Chindi in many ways (intentionally?) evokes memories of Rama for those readers familiar with that craft.<BR>Mcdevitt, though having said that has his own clear resonant voice and is a masterful storyteller in his own right. He controls pace with aplomb and keeps the tension and suspense high throughout the novel. In &quot;Hutch&quot; he has created a remarkable and likable heroine, and in this novel he has provided an excellent supporting cast of strong characters.<BR>This novel is an excellent blend of odes to sci-fi classics of yore and a trend-setter for the future of science fiction.	2004-01-16

Tolkien's the Fellowship of the Ring	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Lord of Fantasy	&quot;The English-speaking world is divided into those who have read THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and those that is going to read it.&quot; - Sunday Times.<br />Assuming you fall into first category a synopsis is redundant, and assuming you are in the second category it is a spoiler. Simply summed up then Fellowship of the Ring is the continuation of THE HOBBIT OR THERE AND BACK AGAIN, which recounts the (mis)adventures of a hobbit, Mr. Bilbo Baggins and a ring. FELLOWSHIP, focuses on Bilbo's heir Frodo Baggins who when Bilbo in his aged state decides to leave his home in Middle-Earths shire, home to hobbits, leaves everything to Frodo. The mysterious yet kind wizard Gandolf drops hints to Frodo that the magic ring is not some parlour trinket, but of a dark design once owned by the evil Sauron, who seeks to claim &quot;the one true ring to rule them all again.&quot; Hence Frodo and his friends begin their journey to destroy the Ring before the forces of evil can destroy them.<BR>Might be hyperbole, but this is debatably the greatest fantasy epic ever written. The measuring stick against which all fantastic tales written since has been measured. Tolkien's gift of language and descriptive detail is second to none, possibly he was a magician in England conjuring stories in reaction to his keen distaste for what he saw the Industrial revolution doing. Read in that context adds an additional layer to a tale into which depths more than one hobbit, elf, dwarf and yes human has fallen.	2004-01-13

In fact rumour has it that doctoral theses have been written on a kind of linear summation of the tome.<BR>Not being an English Lit major, or recieved any education that would help me understand this story I debated doing independent research to try to further enlighten any gracious readers' of this review. However in the end I decided to forego any gratuitous analysis of the text.<BR>Because bottom line, sure one could study this epic in courses, and on one site a reader asked in fact why it wasn't studied in high school, (not going to digress further along this vein), but that is just an example of the density of Pynchon's work. As I started to say thoughm that is only half the story behind Gravity's Rainbow. It deserves to be a classic, or at least neo-classic of literature, for the style of writing, and thematic importance. It also deserves to be read simply for the enoyment of reading, which is why I didn't qoute many papers writen on it, I read it not to study but to luxuriate in the love of language Pynchon obviously shares with many readers. It admittedly took e over 100 pages to get into, as I hadn't read anything stylistically comparable since Joyce, but once I really started reading it, I loved it for its uniqueness, boldness, and for the characters (although the achilles heel as characterization isn't the strongest trait.) Sara Nelson in her memoir stated she meant to read this title because lots of people of intelligence have tackled it, I say tackle it for the sheer joy of Pynchon's manic literary energy.	2004-01-12

Harrington's novel is an historical novel, set in Texas during the period leading up to the (in)famous Battle of The Alamo. Harrington aptly populates his version of events with an eclectic mixture of realistically portrayed Historical figures such as Jim Bowie, David Crockett, and Santa Ana of Mexico, and characters drawn purely from his rich imagination. He breathes so much life into his fictional characters mainly the widow Mary Mott, her son Terrell and botonist Edmund MgGovern that they are as real as the historical figures on the pages in the readers' eyes.<br />This novel is an excellent character study. The ending is obvious, for anyone familiar enough with history to know what happened at the Alamo, but Harrington keeps the reader glued to the pages, by making them care enough about the fates of the Motts and Edmund to be eager to read this epic tome until the dramatic conclussion. Yet it is also more than a character study, in describing his characters so richly Harrington provides insight into many motivations of the human race thus providing insight into the readers' and others psyche. On top of successfully doing this he also details lush descriptions of landscape, and settings transporting whoever reads this novel into Texas at the battle for the Alamo.<br />Powerful storytelling is bandied about way too frequently, but it applies to THE GATES OF THE ALAMO.	2004-01-09

Or perhaps it is just another sign of just how apt this book is and how universal. Possibly everyone that enjoys reading and books as much as Ms. Nelson does feels there are too many books, so little time, which is part of the appeal of her memoir. Everyone may have felt overwhelmed, because they were passionate about reading but Sara Nelson invites the reader into her heart and head as she describes her annual reading habits. It must be very difficult to write a book about reading, and one of the reasons Nelson succeeds is because she (although she has lists in her appendices) doesn't just list the books she's reading, but also sets her reading into context so her own readers' have an idea of what was going on in her life during a particular voyage into her wordy universe.<BR>I particularly enjoyed her chapter on hype and related, as I have often passed up reading excellent novels as well, because the publishers and bookstores overhyped them.<BR>Sara Nelson being a family woman who works in the book industry or at least the magazine field has a very different lifestyle than mine. So her tastes obviously vary to a degree from my own literary choices yet this only heightened my love of her work. I felt books opened up to me that may not have been ever even slight blips on my radar if Nelson didn't mention them. Sara Nelson also had a touching chapter where she read with her son and this particularly hit home for me as well,not that I have children but as she evoked their enjoyment of &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot;. I was nostaltic not only for Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and Charlotte's web but the warm fuzzy feelings I got as I discovered some titles in my youth.<BR>Well my personal recommendation is that no matter how true sure so many books, so little time could be an universal mantra, make time to read this touching and witty memoir.	2004-01-04

There is real subtlety dark humor, touching moments and style in his prose. I read this novel in little over 24 hours that should be a hint about how intense, gripping it is, too many novels are dubbed &quot;compelling&quot; reads but if there is a case where cliche meets fact Fear Itself is that book.	2003-12-22

It is well writtem, and I have to give Ford dues for evidence that he did some research preparing to write this novel.<BR>One of the subplots is Xenophon's freedman (aide de camp is I guess apt title for him) and his romance with Asteria a mysterious women they meet in Prince Cyprus's harem.<BR>Personally although I have nothing against romance in fiction I felt in this particular novel as opposed to touching this reader I felt it took away from the plot. Kudos for Ford letting someone besides his &quot;hero&quot; Xenophon getting the lady, but it was distracting a novel about a war and a warrior should focus on such things. Maybe I am nitpicking but I bring it up as one of the flaws I found in the novel to prevent me as humble Amazon reviewer from giving it more stars.<BR>The only other negative point is related tangentally. I felt that although I could see why Ford chose the first person narrative, at times instead of feeling immediacy with characters, and events I wondered if the &quot;Ten Thousand&quot; may not as been as fun a read if written in the third person.<BR>Both these points are mainly cosmetic as I maintain the &quot;Ten Thousand&quot; is a solid novel.	2003-12-20

She barely has time to register her shock before she discovers one of her young patients Jenny a 13 year old girl has a gun trained on 16 year old Mark Patterson. Jeffrey shoots Jenny.<BR>So begins the second novel set in Grant county written by Ms. Slaughter. Now admittedly I loved loved Blindsighted and bought this second title with very little information. I skimmed the editorial reviews and customer reviews on Amazon but the main motive was how much I enjoyed her first novel.<BR>Having said that I found this one a little harder to stomach. It wasn't that her grisly details turned my stomach as much as I felt in parts Slaughter was trying so hard to shock and repulse reader in her graphicness that other aspects such as characterization suffered. But I continued to read like a witness to a train wreck unable to avert my gaze from the wreckage as her writing got stronger as the plot went along twisting and turning like any thriller's plot ideally does. The people of Grant County have witnessed their share of horror and mourning yet the central characters in her first two novels have come out stronger I think Ms. Slaughter has as well. Finishing this novel I upped my stars for two reasons first I think this is a story Slaughter had to tell and secondly I think it is a story you have to read:).	2003-12-18

Gandolph, after confessing to three murders to the police a decade ago is now reversing his story and claiming innocence in the crime for which he has been incarcerated. Opposing Raven and Gandolph is the police officer who originally heard Gandolph's confession found the incriminating evidence Larry Starczak, and his old lover P.A. Muriel Gwynn.<br />Along the route to justice Raven discovers romance with the sentencing, and since disgraced judge Gillian. The plot takes as many twists and turns as a country road starting at point A and finally arriving at point A2 teehee.<br />While reading this I occassionally flipped back to Turow's about you blurb and discovered an interesting pattern in his publications. It seems that he averages a novel every three years. Now before you object to relevance my fellow(ess) jury of peers, reviewers and consumers, (I know juries can't object call it poetic license) I will try to tie that observation to this review.<br />Critics and readers' alike seem to hail Turow as the master of the legal thriller. He has had acclaim from his debut novel &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; down the line to this offering. I think one of the reasons for his success is he publishes every few years as opposed to some (who shall remain nameless but starts with a G and ends with a M)who apparantly have enough in them to churn out a novel on an annual basis. This I think allows Turow to really get into the hearts and minds of his characters, making them almost painfully realistic to the reader.<br />It is obvious reading a Turow novel that the law is his primary passion in life, good thing as he is a lawyer. Yet he magically uses his novels to point out how flawed the legal system can become if not safegaurded by people of honesty and integrity.<br />His characters aren't neccessarily the most brilliant(although they are all bright) super lawyers in the world, but flawed each in their own way with their own demons to overcome making them more appealing I think to everyone.<br />This novel is honestly not a five star read, but it comes pretty close and the minor flaws I think are trivial compared to how enjoyable and intense the book is so if you want to read another legal thriller (and let's face it for a while the market was satuarated) I would recommend this novel before I might recommend others.	2003-12-11

It is possible though that the communications theory at its core could be dry even dull to one with no interest in the subject matter. That is most definitely not the case though. The anecdotal layout of Watzlawick's writing makes for an informative and fascinating read.<BR>Through no fault of the author's some of the anecdotal stories are a little dated due to the time of publication such as when he writes about cold war situations in his disinformation sectiom. However this does not take away from the theories being discussed in these parts so do not affect the overall reality of the book haha.<BR>If nothing else this book should inspire the reader to question exactly what is reality and muse about objectivity vs. subjectivity in communication thus affecting one's own reality and I think he succeeds admirably in getting his points across in an interesting often funny medium.	2003-12-07

Then I decided that I was writing this review as much for myself as for King's &quot;constant readers&quot;.<BR>In an interview published last year Mr. King himself compared &quot;From a Buick 8&quot; with Christine, if only in the loosest way. I agree with the editorial review however in that the only common thread is that both involve vehicles. This novel is about a Pennsylvania State Trooper Patrol and their impounded Buick, or what looks like a Buick but is a gateway to a Kingesque dimension. Throughout the story the narrative is told by different viewpoints and flashes back and forth from the past to the present like a lightquake.<BR>Although Christine itself was a chilling novel of high standards in the horror genre, this book only seems to contrast just how far King has traveled the literary highway since the publication of Christine.<BR>CHRISTINE was written with almost a manic energy and plot whereas FROM A BUICK 8 builds the tension slowly and only picks up speed near the last chapters where the narrators seem to be almost interrupting each other and spewing the pieces of the story in a rush like the vomit they almost all disgorged at one point or another in the years the Buick has been kept in the barracks.<BR>This device is ingenious as the reader feels the dread, curiosity and sheer terror along with the troopers telling Ned Wilcox the car's history.<BR>It is also obvious in this novel that King's grasp of nuance and language in the art of storytelling has reached its pinnac le making this staunch reader ever more mournful this will be his last non DARK TOWER novel published and wish to cry out ENCORE!	2003-12-06

As her body healed with the help of plastic surgery, she teamed up with other law enforcement agencies hoping by climbing back on the horse her emotional healing could begin. As the taut plot unwinds it is obvious that for Flint to feel whole again she needs revenge on the man that beat her.<BR>This is a crisp and clean thriller that harkens to noir fiction in the best sense of the word. Although Eddy writes with a palpable edge the reader isn't exposed to gratuitous voilence and gore. <BR>Flint is at heart an excellent characterization piece and an invitation to the reader to come to know a truly remarkable heroine.<BR>Although there isn't graphic violence lacing this novel Eddy does an admirable job leading his audience into the world's seedier side. Over all an exciting tense effort, not exceptional but it would be a cold reader indeed that didn't feel for Flint's plight and sympathize with her life's challenges as they read this book.	2003-12-02

I was under the prejudicial cloud that it was a &quot;chick book&quot;, not only because it was written by a young woman, but I think possible because society seems to paint depression as a feminine malaise.<BR>Once I started it, after reading the prologue I learnt to put my first impressions away and read it for what it was; which is a very important book.<BR>Elizabeth Wurzel opens up her mind and soul sharing her happiest(not too many granted) &amp; darkest moments with the reader. She tries to analyze the roots of her feelings, and maybe reach catharsis through the writtem word. Granted there are times in the memoir where she intentionally(?) makes it very hard for her audience to sympathize with her plight at all, and this is a book one probably doesn't want to zip through. In fact it took me longer than planned because I found if I read too much at a time almost by osmosis it seemed, Wurtzel's depression would seep into me. <BR>This book isn't an easy or light read but I stand by my orginal statement it is very important and honest work, and especially relevent to people who have felt not only in a funk or little blue, but that have reached inside themselves swirling in their blackness of the feelings. Wurtzel lets those people know that they are not alone others have felt the same bleakness and lived to find the silver lining amongst the clouds.	2003-11-26
US	30101572	R3EA3VVE4CIMLG	0440240859	293114026	Cloud of Sparrows	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A thrilling historical epic	&quot;A Cloud of Sparrows&quot; is an elegant historical novel, no wait it's a adventure thriller cloaked as an historical novel. Presuming the latter is true it is only suitable that its ambigious genre matches a plot where alliances/loyalties shift faster than the sands of time.<BR>The year is 1861 Japan, and the great lord Genji has opened Japan's doors to American missionaries. This causes a rift in Japanese culture and results in plots and counterplots throughout the story. Virtually every chapter is laced with attempts made on the life of Genji or Stark and Emily the American missionaries.<BR>This novel quite adequately sets explosively exciting scenes of intrique and suspense, as loyalties are forever in doubt, and reader's wonder the meaning of Genji's prophetic visions. <BR>It is a very solid debut novel lush in description, deep in its characterization and remarkably paced.<BR>My only critique is that the shocking resolution of the plot is not as unexpected as some would have the gullible reader believe, the portants were scattered from the start, so the conclusion while possibly surprising to some was a little anticlimatical and disappointing to this jaded reader.<BR>Otherwise this story works on both novels very admirably as a historical tome in Japan, or an intriquing thriller and should draw readers of both genres as a satisfying first effort by the author.	2003-11-26

Oozes with potential, however Mitchell writes a novel of the hunt and hunted of the undead in a convoluted plot of family of vampires trying to escape from Sade's what else sadism haha.<BR>In particular the first few chapters are such a mishmash of characters and scenes you need a scorecard to keep all the players in this game of undead cat and mouse straight. Mitchell only excarerates the situation, by sometimes referring to de Sade as de Sade and sometimes as Louis (it took me half the novel to discover they were the same person).<BR>This is a novel brimming with potential.... unfortantely wasted, the premise places a fresh spin on the vampire mythos, yet in an attempt to write flourishing prose (which succeeds in parts but not in enough passages) with the grace of de Sade's own style the author boggled the reader down with too muc h style without depth.<BR>Mitchell compounds the weaknesses of this story by instead using the vampire's innate sensuality to help tell the tale relies on shock value graphically depicting her love/sex scenes very heavy handedly.<BR>If you are desperate to read a slightly different vampire novel I may recommend this book to you but there are many better books on the market. Also if I was asked to point out example of wasted potential I would recommend this book and point it out as being a case in point.<BR>Writing this review was no fun, after all as a creature of the night it pains me to pan this novel, but honesty prevails in the end.	2003-11-26

Block lovingly paints almost a dozen main characters, a writer accused of killing a realtor, an ex-police commisioner, a lawyer, an art gallery owner only to name a few.<BR>This is a mystery/thriller in name but it is so much more. It is a magnum opus, not implying it is or should be Block's last novel but it just covers so many subplots and themes. The reader is treated not only to a suspenseful exciting story, but also to an inside track of a writer's life. The latter allows Block to suggest a theme so the reader ponders the whole universe of fiction, memory and imagination. One character off-handedly comments how any one is capable of murder and in the context of this tale one has to wonder how honest is that statement.<BR>This was my first Block novel so I have nothing to compare it to per se, and am not sure how capable I am of conveying his range as a writer, in this a love letter at heart to the city of New York.	2003-11-24

Luckily ex-mercenary's Creasy and his adopted 19 year old son have a vested interest in destroying &quot;The Blue Ring&quot;.<BR>The writing in this novel is relatively crisp and clean, perhaps counterpoint to the main plot line. Some of the passages Quinnell pens are indeed very unsettling and disturbing in his description which is almost too realistic. One almost HAS to wonder just how many papers he pulled his plot from, yet paradoxically there are parts where the reader must suspend their disbelief in order for the story on the whole to work.<BR>I enjoyed this book even though it almost gave me nightmares as Quinell redefined what and who evil is in this world.	2003-11-21

It is often set up in informal conversations with peers and other writers giving a sense of intimacy to the reader. Reading it I gained a whole new level of respect for King. Sure there were redundancies and repetitions in places where questions were subtly changed, but with the same general point, but King's answer's showed a level of class and sophistication that may take some non-fans by surprise. There was even some interviews which included George Romero giving the reader a bonus treat of hearing wit and wisdom from two people at the top of their mediums.<BR>This book lets people know the man behind the author, and for me made me want to read/reread more King as stated it just lit up my respect for him like a Christmas tree.	2003-11-17

For those that don't know there is a maxim that the majority I would say of people who have ever thought about or aspired to write are quite familiar with: &quot;Write about what you know.&quot;<BR>Brian McGrory, a Boston newspaperman did just that in &quot;The Nominee&quot;. McGrory a Boston newspaperman, has written another novel where his protagonist is newreporter Jack Flynn.<BR>Jack Flynn can be described as a sardonic, witty, and articulate wordsmith leading me to suspect there is a lot of McGrory in his lead character. Who by the way is quite likable due to above traits, yet Flynn is human in the angst he carries with him throughout the plot and subplots of the story.<BR>This book is a fun read, and the alternating viewpoints from first to third person, while offputting to some, rather appealed to my tastes.<BR>McGrory not only describes life at a newspaper through the novel, but also has managed to write a fun and fast paced thriller to boot. Highly recommended. (Hope that wasn't a dangling participle Flynn would kill me haha.)	2003-11-17

He instructs his protegee the use of peyote to meet spirit guides such as mescalita almost as enigmatic an entity as don juan haha. It is hard to really describe what this book has to offer, because although it can be it is not written as a casual read.<BR>The style is accessible, yet filled with metaphysical insights making it definitely NOT a skimmer, this book can be reread many times and leave one with fresh ideas.<BR>The Teachings of don Juan is an important book in the mold that Huxley's The Doors of Perception is important not advocating mind altering drugs but with the clear message that there is truth revealed through hallicenigens administered with caution.<BR>I enjoyed it, yet still trying to wrap my head around several of the ideas written within.	2003-11-16

That doesn't mean it was neccessarily bad, or I wouldn't have given it four stars. However in my opinion the author chose brevity over characterization resulting in 2 1/2 dimensional characters instead of 3 dimensional ones the readers could really care about while perusing the story.<br />Dessert: The best part about &quot;The Criminalist&quot; is that Relling, as the critics hailed is a great storyteller. This novel trascends genres, building a neuveaux bridge between horror and thriller. The book has elements as both inspiring me to label it a Throllor teehee.<br />Basically &quot;The Criminalist&quot; is the story of children being murdered by a serial killer, who baffles law enforcement. As political pressure and the tragedy of the unknown killer's actions overwhelm the California town of San Patricio, the police resort to allowing (reluctantly) the recently widowered psychic Ken Bennett to assist in the investigation.<br />The pace of this story is steady, and perhaps a nice point is that unlike some thrillers on the market whose resolution of tension seems to trendily occur about 100 pages from the end Relling manages to keep the action intense until the last chapter.<BR>This is great escapist fiction, and could stereotypically be called a short read, as it is not long and once the &quot;pop fiction&quot; reader gets into it, they will find the pages being turned at a relentless pace.<BR>If I wanted to nitpick I could detail more yet I believe this isn't a book likely to be found on any English lit curriculum so will finish by saying it really is Criminally good and if Relling lets his now high standard of thrilling prose slide in new fiction I will supbeona him haha.	2003-11-13

So let's not be too finicky but I just couldn't will myself to give this book four stars.<BR>I seem to remember back in the(I think it was early eighties) a large brouhaha surrounding the Dead Sea Scrolls. I never knew exactly what all the fuss was about until I read this book.<BR>Baigant and Leigh have again written a tome in which their extensive research on the subject is self-evident. They give a lot in fact almost too much background information on the Dead Sea Scroll's discovery and subsequent custody issues.<BR>This book is very informative, as mentioned but and here's where I couldn't give it four stars it lacks the zing that Holy Blood Holy Grail had. Is it fair to give a book less stars because an earlier work was so completely damp (as opposed to &quot;Deception's relative dryness). Maybe maybe not, but authors are constantly being measured against their own accomplishments and works and in this case these two unfortunately are a little wanting.<BR>Finally to finish on positive note, this book is well written very informative, and has some excellent photo sections for those interested in learning about the Dead Sea Scrolls.	2003-11-11

Why is Black Water different?<BR>Where to begin, it starts out as a liesurely outing between Mira and her 13 year old daughter Annie. Soon a man is in apparant trouble with his boat motor and since his arm is in a cast Annie gives him the benefit of doubt of assistance - buzzzzzzzzzz wrong answer it was the \\"pity ploy\\". She regains unconsciousness lost geographically, and chronologically as Mira discovers herself in June 1968.<BR>Therein lies the freshness and extreme inventiveness of the plot. MacGregor has added a whole new twist on the kidnapped child plot. And not just one this novel winds around in different twists and turns throughout. The Black Water that is the corridor into the past is not only a useful device as it makes the victim much harder to find, but makes the villians motives that much more interesting.<BR>Not only does Black Water entertain, it also makes one ponder all the rules and paradoxes of time travel at one point Mira, who I forgot to mention like her grandmother is psychic(c'mon did you really believe time travel was only added ingredient of this pot-pourri of a fun read?)Macgregor even has a cameo by Janis Joplin in this story how's that for adding even more interest to the tale? Bottom line is can we even with hypothetical power of time travel change course of history?<BR>Read Black Water to ponder these and other issues.:)	2003-11-10

Manfred, Prince of Otronto prepares for his son' wedding day, but suddenly his son is crushed by a giant helmet. Not confident his wife would provide him with another male heir to carry on his line Manfred decides he wishes to marry his passed son's fiancee, Isabella. Fearing a marriage to tyrannical Manfred Isabella flees with help of the peasant Theodore, and finds sanctuary with the monk Jerome.<BR>As Manfred tries to convince Jerome to bless his marriage to Isabella(and grant divorce from his wife)emmisaries from Isabella's family arrive at the castle. There is question of the legimitacy to Manfred's claim to the princedom of Otronto it seems and the rightful heir is Isabella's father one of the reasons Manfred is so keen on a marital union between the families. This all happens in the first fifty or sixty pages, and even as summed up I failed to really express how much takes place in this little book. Let's just say this is a dense plot, so much happening in so little time.<BR>I tried to finish this book in time to post my review ofr it on Halloween, but The Castle of Otronto is not a book that can be called a fast read, nor is it a book you wish to skim pages on.<BR>Walpole successfully blended romance and supernatural suspense leading the way in a genre of fiction that is still emulated and popular to this day.<BR>The Castle of Otronto is a great Gothic novel and it is also a great novel period.	2003-11-03

Early on in the novel she is \\"invited\\" to a meeting with the President. Apprehensive about President Herney's motives since her father Sen. Sedgewick Sexton is the primary opposition not only in the upcoming election, but in virtualy every political standpoint. Especially NASA spending so Rachel reluctantly attends the meeting to be asked to endorse NASA's latest discovery...<br />This novel is about many things but the one that hit me in between the eyes is AMBITION. Both political and personal. Dan Brown always seems to have something to say in his novels besides the main plot and here he seems to ask loudly how far would some people go to attain their ambitions.<br />I disagree with one review about writing Dan Brown novels while most of the statements he made may be true I disagree, in that this novel the good guys didn't wear white caps and bad guys black.<br />What I mean is everyone involved in the story seemed to vary in shades of gray for nine tenths of the novel. With the exception of Tolland and Rachel Sexton whose character's were pretty pure. Everyone else though seemed to do what was neccessary to do what was right in their eyes even perhaps was not right in the majority's eyes. An experienced thriller reader could perhaps guess who the ultimate villian was but by clouding the supporting casts motives I feel Brown did a superb job of building and maintaining suspense. One minor flaw is I felt his characters could've been built a bit more as I found them maybe not 2 dimensional but bordering on 2.5 dimensional, whereas as a reader ideal characters in fiction are of course 3 dimensional haha.<br />Although this book is about NASA (to a great extent) and its discovery, it is not rocket science. It is among the upper echelon of thrillers I would say ( as was Angels & Demons, I havem't read da Vinci code yet, but when reading it I would suggest to both Sunday readers (those reading fiction for pleasure like drivers' liesuely driving through the country admiring the scenery.) and more critical reader's (who for whatever reason if they are going to review a book or not.) to take this novel for what it is which I claim is an exciting thriller indeed.s' liesuely driving through the country admiring the scenery.) and more critical reader's (who for whatever reason if they are going to review a book or not.) to take this novel for what it is which I claim is an exciting thriller indeed.	2003-11-03

This is a collection of \\"True Accounts\\" of hauntings and other suernatural occurances.<BR>Having stated what this nonfictio work is \\"about\\", let me hastily add it is much more than the sum of its parts. That is \\"Haunted Heritage\\" is a collection of ghost stories, that is much more than a collection of ghost stories.<BR>Each spooky anecdote provides some background of a biographical and/or historical nature providing readers with a context for the ghostly tales contained therein. This aspect is what makes the volume worthwhile reading, I am sure everyone knows many ghost stories told around campfires etc, but it is who the ghosts were when they were alive that adds immediacy and intimicy to this book.<BR>One of my favourite chapters ( and I use that term loosely as they are more geographical/topical dividers than traditional chapters.) States how the art of the oral tradition of storytelling is a dying art, a pretty obvious tradition, yet reading it stated so baldly in this type of work really brought the point home.<BR>The other bonus is that while these tales cover a large timescale from 1600s to present, and everything from the mysterious to the outrageous the authors' report without editorilizing the stories this repeats. <BR>On one personal note I am not sure if trying to finish it to review for halloween, or a subtle change in author's tone is responsible but about three quarters of the way through I was genuinely spooked by what I read. <BR>Please leave lights on when devouring this latest offering in series.	2003-10-31

Mark Beamon Novel.<BR>Mark Beamon is unhappily promoted to SAC (Special Agent In Charge) of the Phoenix F.B.I. office when he witnesses a picture of a rocket launcher held by suspected Middle Eastern Terrorists. His fellow agent and friend Laura catches the case but makes little headway as she feels the C.I.A. is stonewalling her she appeals to Beamon for help. He goes undercover in a crime drug syndicate and things quickly go downhill for him professionally as it seems the higher ups are more concerned with nailing a drug lord than discovering the truth.<BR>I've been a fan of Mills since his first book, and reluctantly admit this one I enjoyed much less than his others. I was torn about this review because the book has definite good points, for instance it may be the best post 9/11 novel dealing with terrorism in general and on American soil in particular. Mark Beamon is an extremely likable hero being intelligent, bold and a bit of a rogue. Yet for his strengths he has times of self doubt and guilt making him more human and real. <BR>So wherein lies the problem? Wish I could pinpoint it. For some reason I had trouble for the first time getting into a Beamon novel. I'm not sure if it is because although he's grown as a character the ground may be too familiar to hold my interest or...<BR>mainly I would say the plot although tight as far as it went was just too convoluted. Mills basically was juggling too many issues and info in this one to focus his intensity on the main threat and I think that hurt the story. Beamon or Laura would occassionally throughout remind readers the main thread was a missile that had to be located. Yet for most of the middle Mills described various drug bosses and their aims and politics, and the drug lords just weren't that interesting characters would rather have read more about Yassin and his viewpoint than some two bit mobster.<BR>Anyhow not his best but still better than average thriller on the market.	2003-10-26

Freedman again presents an anti-hero worthy of readers' emotion, and it is not there I failed to totally fall for this story. <BR>It is just not exceptional. The tie-in with Ollie the Crane was nice play on title, but the overall plot didn't make me go wow I've gotta stay up all night reading. I know Freedman is an extrememely talented writer and although this could be he most mature work I can't claim its his best. Having said that I am reviewing it not necessarily to give it the ol'  2 thumbs up but to at least praise it as being worthy for a quick read.	2003-10-24

King's writing seems to get stronger and stronger. His storie's illuminate him as being an everyman, and who better to write about the &quot;everyman&quot;. The quartet in this tale's narrative travel's back and forth in chronology proving that even as he hits middle(late?) age King still can relate and tell the story of young people.<br />Above all else this is the story of friendship, and hope in times of darkness, while some readers may not have found it particularly scary there were times even during my second reading when I felt definitely creeped out as only King can do.<br />This book while exploring many elements that makes King such an incredible horror novelist may appeal to non-horror fans with strong stomachs though because of aforementioned theme, and King's classy writing style.	2003-10-24

The statistics of lifestyles at the end of the nineteenth century provided by Rumbelow is evidence A that he &quot;did his homework&quot; and researched his subject matter fully.<BR>I am not usually a fan of true crime novels but had to get this book as Jack is such an infamous personage and wasn't disappointed. Rumbelow writes about the murders with passion without sensationalism that the book may have elicited in hands of another and describes the setting the lives of the victims, theories and letters from the Ripper and parrallel cases. This is probably the most complete book on Jack The Ripper and wholly lives up to its name as being the Complete Casebook so for anyone with at least passing interest in the Infamous Ripper I suggest they read this book to better understand the murders.	2003-10-22

This novel is no exception as the dark humour flows freely making it an even more enjoyable read as the novel becomes a game of cat and mouse as whose got da money????<BR>Meltzer's writing hasn't waned and I enjoyed this almost as much as The First Counsel (personally I think that was his best offering). My one critique is some of the minor characters seemed a bit less three dimensional than in his other novels. His characterization is one of his main strengths and appeals for me so I feel this was a little flawed otherwise it would get five stars. However having said that if Amazon peruser's are looking for a fast fun read, better written than your average thriller as I said read this book!	2003-10-22

As I pretty much feel the conclusion to the 2 volume epic of a witch's trial was worthy of the suspense and insight of the first volume (Judgement Of The Witch.) McCammon's prose didn't flag or let up at all in this incredible story and only addenum really to my review of volume one will be if there was ever any doubt this novel should soldify McCammon's reputation as a master story teller. I hope the rumours of his retirement are false as this novel made me thirst (no pun on his novel They Thirst ok maybe little pun); for more!	2003-10-21

Kate McKinnon is an ex-cop socialite/art scholar/philanthopist lured back to her cop's lifestyle by a string of grisley murder's in New York's art scene. The plot sound a little trite? It could, but the author's superb skills as a novelist prevent this thriller from becoming trite. The main character of Kate is a very likable heroine, surrounded by a colourful cast of supporting character's with their own shadow's and demons making them feel very real at least to this reader. About two thirds of the way through I pondered if maybe Kate wasn't a little too perfect to maintain the gritty tone of the tale, yet Santofeler countered this potential pitfall nicely by upping Kate's paranoia to match the reader's reminding us that she could be a live person. This book does have some graphic description, yet it all is tied in with the plot as opposed to gratiutous voilence to sell copies. I was very much drawn into the art world, and explored the shadows and darkness along with Kate.<BR>This thriller isn't perfekt but I challenge fellow reviewers to show me a perfekt thiller and I'll ask yes but can you show me a perfect one? It is close enough for me especially considering what a strong first effort it is by the author and I eagerly await some mover and shaker in Hollywood to buy the movie rights to this book as it seems almost too adaptable to the big screen, so I recommend you read this book, but careful to massage your knuckles once in a while to prevent whiteness as you peruse this page turner.	2003-10-21

Some speculation admittedly if this was a novel written by Mr. Ludlum or by someone else, I claim it matters not, this is by far his best novel since The Bourne Identity. The book is long but every page is packed with suspense, thrills, chills, and even romance. The plotting is as familiarly paced ( i.e. fast paced) as one has come to expect of a thriller bearing Mr. Ludlum's name. Some may be disappointed which is there perogative, personally, I felt his characterization and general technical background was deeper than in some of his recently published novels and as a whole The Janson Directive is an action packed page turner (cliche but true.)	2003-10-21

A magistrate is summoned and is in fact the third magistrate to attempt to reach the settlement to try the accused, but after a misadventure he arrives with his young intelligent clerk.<BR>This book as I stated isn't rightfully classified as horror unlike Stinger or some of his works it is instead almost an historical suspense novel. Yet there is dark underlining to the town and real evil which I feel makes it a very borderline book bridging multi genres. It could be horror the way Swan Song was horror, or historical mystery as the root is to solve who killed Rachel's husband, and the Reverend.<BR>McCammon's writing has obviously matured greatly during his writing sabbatacal, this novel transports the reader to late 17th century America. The character's speak and act as settler's probably did in that time, and McCammon's gift of painting a scene with words increased with time. A very eerie ( not scary mind you haha) first volume of a two-volume novel.	2003-10-21

I read the reviews before purchasing the book yet despite surprising numeber of harsh reviews read it and enjoyed it. The premise is original enough alone for a little fictional escapism.<BR>Henry Pierce is a molecular scientist &quot;Chasing The Dime&quot;, when he breaks up with his girlfriend, well dumped more appropriate word, moves into new apartment with new phone number. After numerous calls to wrong number it becomes obvious the number is shared with an excort who advertised her services on web site, and has since disappeared. Pierce having lost his sister to familar fate long ago decides in attempt to redeem his lack of doing enough for her in past will try to find Lilly.<BR>I was actually impressed with Connelly's main character, whereas some found him incredible I found his traits, motivations and other characteristics very believable from the get go. Overall I have to say I thought this was not an exceptional thriller, as a fellow reviewer pointed out the ending was little Hollywood, but that may be because it has movie rights written all over it. This novel is very adaptable to big screen but I don't think it takes away from it as a read, again reinstate not reading anything else yet by Connelly can't say if it was up to par with his Harry Bosch or other non Harry Bosch novels, but I think its good novel to get one interested in him as a writer it sure did me. Last thing this novel has excellent pacing and is fast read, one slight dip where it lagged but overall it was very fast and well done.	2003-10-08

Ooops. I found many reviews to be unesserarily harsh, of course I am speakinmg subjectively, but I think all reviews on here have bit of subjectivity. Let me explain myself though in hopes it will encourage other people to give this book a chance.<BR>Mike Dash researched extensively as on can tell reading this tome of the unknown, and I thought he did an exceptional job presenting case studies of bizarre phenomena, and possible rational explanations for them. Some negative reviews seemed to take Dash's explanations personally as if his intent was to completely debunk all of the unexplained occurances. My interpretation of his introduction, and much of the text itself is that he merely wished to seperate the chaff from the wheat. In other words Dash's book I think is more credible from his playing devil's advocate and explaining to reader how many hoaxes in paranormal activities exist. Like Scully of X-Files his tone can be skeptical but he has open mind of the possibilities and doesn't intend reader's to fall into trap of becoming zealots and thinking everything not immediately explicable by science must have supernatural explanation. In this he succeeds, making this book educational, insightful and most important perhaps entertaining.	2003-10-04

In that I agree with fellow reviwer's; yet this so familiar theme is given the Barker dark twist as The Barborossa family hides not only secrets, but powers as well. This novel is billed as a romance and is at that, however Barker's gift for language, description and the human condition lifts this book above most in the category. I found the story compelling and again differ from many Barker fans in not being disappointed with this offering. It was a slight departure from his usual style, granted but I think it shows him growing as a writer and more importantly author to not depend so much on gore and graphic description to keep his readers enthralled. The ending was open enough that I am eagerly anticipating a sequel.	2003-10-04

The story starts out with a nuclear attack on the U.S. What a way to hook readers. In post apolocolyptic America servral bands of survivors struggle to rebuild if not the country at least their own lives amd reconstruct some kind of community. At the heart of the GOOD group is a little girl ( who the readers are, as long as they have a heart, very much rooting for and enjoying watching her grow in the novel.) The forces of evil hunt her because she has power to restore life to the damaged dead earth which supplies the tension and suspense of this incredibly touching, novel.<BR>McCammon writes his story beuatifully, with almost lyrical prose a he describes post-apocolyptic America and I bet most readers are with me about genuinely caring what happens to the characters. However my one critique (other than length which is non-issue because it really doesn't seem that long.) is the (not another comparison haha) fact that the themes and plot almost too closely mirror the Stand which I believe is not only King's best novel but the best novel in the genre. So I had to give this excellent dark fantasy/horror tale 4 instead of 5 stars due to that. However slight lack of originality doesn't diminish one's overall enjoyment of this excellent book.	2003-10-04

Few pages later car crashes into Texas gas station with all passengers dead of mysterious virus. Captain Trips as the virus comes to be known wipes out a large percentage of America. In the rest of the novel we see the forces of good against the forces of evil in two distinct camps. <BR>That synopsis doesn't do the plot justice but I don't want to give too much away. Suffice to say the Stand is a thick book, with little lagging or extraneaous information. After reading it twice and reshuffling my reading schedule to get ready to read it a third time I decided to review it a hard task as how do you review a book that simply put could be the best in the genre in the market ever. King published the Stand in the late seventies then released an uncut unabridged version in 1991 I believe. It is still being printed to which should be a sign of its popularity. <BR>King has really outdone himself in this one by backing away a little from reanimation of dead pets, ghostly cars, village of vampires, he has perhaps written his most chilling novel in that the set-up which begins the horror of the Stand is very realistic. It's terror is timeless as an accidental virus could very well be released it touches the realm of possibilty more than some of his novels.<BR>King being King tho there is elements of supernatural in this immensely entertaining book Randall Flag is such an evil villian I think other authors went to well trying to compare someone even remotely in his league teehee. <BR>King's characterization in this novel may be his best yet( not including some of his more mature novels written when he was in or approaching middle age like bag of bones). The plot as stated is intense and never lets go. The middle pages could be trimmed a little haha but then it wouldnt be uncut and the description add not takes away from overall enjoyment of the book. To conclude to any who read this that haven't read the Stand please go beg borrow or steal (just joking) a copy and read it I guarantee you will be glad you did. (assuming you have any interest in King or genre.)	2003-10-04

That is the extent of plt summary this review is going to get. This novel is periphally science fiction, but like the true masters before him Card uses a speculative setting to focus on humanity. I always felt the best sci-fi were humanistic novels that happened to contain extrateresstial or extraoridnary occurances. Ender's Game leads the pack. Card did such an intensely accurate job in his characterization, that I'm sure I am not alone in being choked up watching the government manipulate Ender for their own ends, but &quot;with the best of intentions&quot; Ender is a wholly three dimensional character as are his comrades whose training affects the fate of the earth. This novel is better I thought than his follow ups Speaker for the Dead Etc. And with Ender's Shadow series released(I haven't read it yet but its on my list) I know at least this past summer there was renewed interest in the original, and rightfully so. One of the best aspects about this novel is its universal appeal, my friend who doesn't read as a rule LOVED IT which says much about Card's talents.	2003-10-04

In this novel Conrad Voort last seen in The Broken Hearts Club and Irresistable, meets his childhood friend in a bar and recieves a list of names on a napkin. Bang like a shot the plot takes off with the speed of an assasin's bullet. Voort soon discover's that four of six names on the mysterious list have passed away in accident's, and after meeting a fifth name Dr. Jill Towne, he vows she won't be amongst the victims. <BR>The author's writing has evolved (I repeat)as he more fully flushes out his protaganist's character. Voort breaks up with one love interest in previous novels over the issue of abortion. Cynic's will say the pairing of Jill and Conrad was predictable and Camilla was discarded conviently to make room for his character's new female interest. However, I debate that his struggles with relationships (without giving away whole story there is side issues with Jill too.) is what makes his hero so identifiable and human to the reader. Particularly in this novel his villians are never merely evil two dimensional bad guys, rather again vividly drawn character, all too human and real.<BR>Ethan Black has also expanded the scope of his plotting in this recent entry, he imagines new challenges and cases for Voort to work on that takes him outside of standard Sex Crimes modus Operanti. This isn't thickest book on the market, yet the buyer definitely gets their money worth as each page is densely packed with characterization, plot and sub-plot. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	2003-10-01

A tissue sample Mark has analyzed soon shows that it wasn't a clear cut accident, but rather murder that ended the &quot;popular&quot; astronauts life.<BR>Michael Cassutt does an excellent job bringing the world of Nasa to life in this novel. Some reviewers have commented that they felt the technical details bogged down the plot, yet I found them helpful to fully immerse myself in the fictional world Cassutt was creating. His writing style isn't extravagant or particularly flamboyant, yet technically sound without being dull. Over all I would say this isnt the most thrilling thriller/mystery I've ever read, but nonetheless a satisfying one with deep enough characterization to keep me intriqued.	2003-10-01

This book I finished in little over 48 hours though, so intriquing did I find the author's thesis. Knight and Lomas do a really detailed job of explaining the history of ancient Egypt, and the nation that was to become Israel. The research they did preparing for publication is obvious, in  the footnotes and in their writing period. My favorite aspect of the book tho was when they described the casual logic of their arguments i.e &quot;Chris discovered so and so and theorized such and such.&quot; It brings an immediacy to the book lending credence to their documentation of facts and hypotheses. <BR>If you know any freemason's or wish to learn about their history this is a superb text drawing on sources as far back as Mose's time and before.<BR>Is this the perfect book on templar's, freemasonry, and the history of Christianity then? Of course not. It's v ery good, but some of their theories regarding Christianity and in particular Jesus seem a little too out there, interesting speculation but they didn't convince me some of their claims were factual. The only other minor point is their persistence in claiming the scribes of the Old testament wrote it down thousands of years after events deterrioting large portions of its credibility whereas most Jewish and Christian people seem to claim that Moses was author of the first five books of the bible so although generations have passed he was witness to many events. Also if we accept Moses being the author its easy to believe the oral history was preserved enough for accurate penning of it down by him.<BR>Overall an incredibly complex, fascinating book that teaches much, and urges reader to question roots of rituals and dogma in religion.	2003-09-22

The author's voice though is invigorating as he fearlessly writes a novel that challenges people to think and examine their own lives and wonder science vs. faith hmmmmmmmmm?

Brian Herbert's and Kevin Anderson's House Trilogy introduced me to the Dune Universe. I Picked up House Atreides on a whim and have read the trilogy, then most of the original Dune series. Dune is one of if not my all time favourite sci-fi series (only real competition it recieves is from the Foundation series.)<BR>I anxiously awaited the release of this title in pocketbook ( I prefer pocketbooks to hardcover ersonal quirk), and was not disappointed. The successors to the writing of the Dune mythology seamlessly weave a background 10,000 years before the events of Dune take place. The titans, i.e. cymeks ( humans who have sacrificed their human bodies for immortal machine shells for their biological brains) overthrew the empire and years later their creation ominus a sentient computer controls most of the known universe. Pockets of humans are determined to win back their freedom and overthrow their tyrannical overlords, such as Serena Butler, Cena Zufna, Inglis, Xavier Harkonnen and more.<BR>The author's not only develop further history further expanding the universe Frank Herbert created, they also draw obvious parallels to classic mythology. The titans Ajax, Barbarossa Agemommon and Juno for instance are familiar names to those that know their Greek and Roman Mythology. They interweave many concurrant subplots as they explore the origins of Arrakis, and  sects and groups like the Beneserine(sp) sisterhood. This book is an excellent exciting, multi-layered science fiction tale, no matter how acquainted the reader is to Dune. One of the benefits the authors' have of going so far back into Dune's past is the novel not only answers some questions for the serious Duneophile, but also can draw new curious readers into the legend without them having to read the oringinal series or even the House trilogy to understand whats going on. Well done looking very forward to the second novel.	2003-09-21

By drawing parallels to court cases Strobel not only brings an immediacy to his own investigation, but also draws the reader in as evidence for the Christian faith is presented in a logistical logically sound manner. An excellent book for Christians or those searching for a faith yet unsure if there's anything beyond myth and dogma to Christianity.	2003-09-21

Right away I state I don't believe this is his best work, but his passing in 2001 lends it an exrta eerie factor. The novel revolves around (as in most cases with Laymon's books many things) but here primarily a group of College Students, playing with a Ouija board one night, and deciding to take a trip to find the treasure it referred to in its message to them. <br />Laymon's character's are realistically realized, and I'm consistently amazed how well he writes young people. As I stated I would not claim this to be his best work, yet it has his trademarked bluntness (note not neccesarily gore) in describing human horrors blended with occultism and the supernatural. Laymon wrote each book I've read with the consistent unflinching manner, Darkness Tell Us is no Exception. There were parts overtly disturbing yet the reader(me in any case) is compelled to gulp fresh air and read on anxious to discover where the dark path Laymon leads us along will take us, and if there's any light at the end of the journey.<BR>One peer/reviewer wrote He is King or Koontz without a conscience, and this novel again demonstrates how accurate that description is may he rest in more peace than some of his characters(and readers no doubt) have after finsishing a work by a genuine Horror scribe of the first order.	2003-09-19

Recently I have been on a little non-fiction reading rampage. My main phase of interest is prophesies, omens, signs etc. This book seemed the perfect match to peruse. Right away I could tell Mr. Gilbert put a lot of research into this project. His open admission of Christianity at first made me little apprehensive worried he would put his bias on the book. Not so he writes informatively on his subject, teaching his readers' not only that &quot;as above so below&quot; is not only an ancient dogmatic catch phrase, but a true parralel in our universe. I also learnt much about Ancient Egyptian mythology that fascinated me, and Gilbert's theories on Christ's education, and Egyptian influence on Christianity is a view I pondered and although still need to explore more before I buy into everything he wrote on subject Gilbert definitely gave readers theories to think about including the foretelling and prophesies regarding the end of this age. Before I give away too much I will end this review saying in short Signs in The Sky is highly educational, thought- provoking work on subject matter that many have written about but Gilbert does so classily, and objectively.	2003-09-18

I was very pleased that I did. Willis's writing style is refined, but not overly edited. In other words she tells her story with the poise that her lead character Joanna posseses. The themes in the book are subtly explored for the most part, i.e. Willis resists temptation to sermonize too overtly over her own beliefs. My favorite characteristic of the novel was the refreshingly lack of saccharine romances that find its way into too many of the best thrillers. A male and female character can have feelings for each other without neccesarily consumating their love in physical manner. The only real critique I have of this novel is its length, Ms. Willis suffers from a mild case of Dickenitus using pages of description where a paragraph or two will paint vivid image for reader. In conclussion I can not say I'm a rapid Willis fan after reading this book, but will explore some of her other novels having enjoyed this one.	2003-09-18

Doctor David Spier is a recently widowed, grieving man, still trying to restart his romantic life in L.A. To complicate matters he is faced with alkali attacks against his staff. The police apprehend the &quot;perp&quot;, case closed right, Wrong! Clyde the psychatiatrically imbalanced man responsible for the attacks escapes police custody, due partly to the responsibility of Dr. Spier, and the real hunt has begun.<br />Hurwitz( this is my first novel I've read by him) is an extremely accomplished author. I admit I was almost daunted in the early pages when he graphically descibes medical proceedures in a buey E.R. However he toned down the jargon in later chapters and instead painted vivid characterizations of both antangonist and protangonist. His novel is also intelectually stimulating as well as imgaginatively stimulating, due to some key issues that arise from his plot such as how adherant to hippocratic oath doctors should be, and revenge versus justice. A great read that I feel picks up pace nicely as it goes along.	2003-08-15

This tale begins with anightmare by a young man, who then unwittingly passes it to his mother. The chain is thus begun into a nightmare that grips a small town. There are forces of good arrayed against the sinister force gripping the townspeople tho, a young lady whos thought she escaped her haunted past who finds she must return to her hometown to fight the evil once again.  A priest whose faith falters, then is regained; a parapsychogolist and his assistant, and a skeptical police officer.<BR>The narrative of this tale picks up force as it approaches it's climax. Ross doesn't gratuitously use gore to scare his readers but relies successfully on increased tension and suspense. His horror is indeed horrifying, and I'll admit I lost some sleep reading this novel.	2003-08-15

Originally I was intriqued by its subtitle so picked it up and started reading it hungrily devouring it in a week. It is a novel so different, so extraordinary as to only be justified in the description magical. What makes it so great is that it has the ability to appeal to people with PHDs in Philosophy, or those totally ignorant or who Socrates was. As one read's Sophie's story I imagine even slightly jaded readers' can't resist vacariously sharing her sense of wonder as she learns about and explores the world she lives in. It is indeed a crash course on the History of Philosophy, even more accessible than Durant's books. As an added bonus as one reads further into the novel the author forebodes a twist. Overall an immensely enjoyable read that makes one think and ask pertinanet questions we are othwerwise likely too busy to explore.	2003-08-04

In the opening credits her father receives a gift of gratitude from a patient whose life he saves, a grimoire. This grimoire is not only a rare and priceless book, but also a dark one as its chief concern is the art of black magic. Somewhat predictably Beatrice's who by the way in nice touch by author is named after Dante's Beatrice)father is killed for this book.<BR>So begins a very dense novel. I mean dense in the most literal sense it is packed with conspiracies, ex-naxi intrique, feminism and erotic passages. So this novel has something for everyone right? <BR>Almost unfortunately Hitchcock through her protaganist makes it all too clear who her main audience is ( as one reviewer titled their review \\"Hear me Roar\\"). I say unfortunately because I picked up this book due to interesting synopsis on back working at a used book store I thought it was a novel for me. My interest in paranoral and occult also added to its appeal. <BR>While I give credit to Ms. Hitchcock for having a suspenseful fun and well researched; as I could tell it was largely based on fact novel I did find some things that prevented me from giving it five stars. The main point is that Beatrice transforms into a feminist so quickly and completely its almost as if her purpose is to make male readers as uncomfortable and guilty for enjoying the book. I guess I'm saying I think Hitchcock was very brave writing this ( assuming at least part of her is contained within Beatrice's new outlook), but feel saddened she felt she had to be so in your face to get her point across. Like Beatrice almost knocking her ex-husband over the head with frying pan to prove shes changed and became darker in her sexuality with her wolf. I fear Ms. Hitchcock didn't give her male readers' enough credit for getting it. Thereby I think and almost suspect she intentionally alienated a portion of her readership but these musings didn't diminish my enjoyment of the novel in the long run.	2003-08-04

Netherworld is very informative, and well written, however my main critique is that it takes too long to get to the meat of the issue. Though Temple does an excellent and thorough job describing the oracles made famous by antiquitity and ancient myths, I felt myself growing impatient to read about actual foretelling, and prohecy. As stated its obvious he researched this title very well, and I learnt much from it. It just wasnt quite as exciting or intriquing as I suspected though, through no fault of his. I would in conclussion recommend this book to real history buffs, and those interested in ancient practices of foretelling the future. I learnt a lot about the oracles I never knew so in that sense Temples book is education. I just wish he gave more details in parts and less in other topics covered in his book.	2003-08-04

The author has yet again expanded his scope in writing by slightly detouring around his usually thrilling subject matter into a slightly more ethereal world.<BR>Why does the attractive Eve Sumner whisper soon to Oil geologist John Waters at a soccor game? This is a question Waters asked himself at the start of the tale, then spends much effort and sanity trying to convince others of the answer.<BR> Once again Iles turns up the suspense and tension in his latest thriller, while at the same time causing the reader to think and ask some curious questions about what we believe of the afterlife, the nature of true love and sanity. Despite being slightly different from his previous works in tone I think Mr. Iles has maintained the thrill factor very well in this latest offering, and give him credit for having the courage to write a slightly different story than the kind his readers and fans have grown used to. I felt lumps in my throat in parts due to the high level of paranoia he invokes throughout Sleep No More. A very good title for horror fans that may not normally consider reading Iles and for thriller fans that expect more than typical thrills in their fiction.	2003-08-04

Holy Blood, Holy Grail is an extremely thoroughly well researched book. About two-thirds of the way through I reflected how much I had learnt from it about medieval history and European royalty. At the same time I couldn't help but wonder where the controversy, or brouhaha lay, then the authors hit me with the theory all their well documented research was building towards. It almost knocked me out. This book is informtive yet not at all dry or dull, I could describe it as a combination Indiana Jones meets The Ten Commandments haha. The theory while I don't personally subscribe to it is very plausible and often well thought out. The book builds like a symphony raising with a crescendo of text building to fill all the senses. Holy Blood Holy Grail also gives one much to think and speculate upon which I think in the end is the suthors' only mandate, so I say they succeed very well indeed.	2003-07-26

Yet a credit to him is the fact that this book is the opposite of dry. Casanova was a Book Lover is wetter than the Amazon(no pun intended) Rain Forest, as he adds dashes of wit to his wisdom regarding his subject matter. There were passages I literally laughed out loud even as my uneducated (respectively speaking) brain soaked up his tidbits of knowledge. This text isnt perfect obviously, and confession time I skimmed a page here and there. Overall though it is arguably the best book on books writtin within the last decade. Perhaps the greatest compliment is his ability and agility in appealing to both the Literrati, and layperson in this book;s text and factiods. A fine touch of irony in that he seems disparaging of the Amazon review process, and I see his point in many ways, yet his work gets glowing reviews(mine isnt first or hopefully last). Well done Mr Hamilton, though you may snort if you happen to come across this review teehee, I stand by my critique.	2003-07-15

New York City, century old bodies are discovered under a building opening up an old murder case. Enter John Smithback reporter, Pendergast FBI and Dr. Kelly archeaologist. A cast of characters recognizable to fans of their work through other novels. The museum which employs Kelly puts pressure on the police and FBI not to investigate case too closely lest their reputation is besmirched. This book is slight departure from the novels we are used to from this dynamic duo in that instead of a creature the villian or nemesis is human. It still contains some speculative fiction, but instead of relying on creatures from the collective consciousness nightmares the authors rely on human from nightmares to propel plot. This work is an excellent blend of historic setting and present day. The writing as in all their books is fast paced and exciting, the suspense is intact making it overall a very enjoyable read. In fact parts of this book reminded me of Carr's The Alienist, so good were Child, and Preston at transporting me to 19th century New York. A very excellent summer(or any season) read.	2003-07-10

It stays pretty true to Silver Bullet the movie based on it, or it was based on I forget which came first in this case. The book is quite short, so those that criticize King of having a propensity of being a ilttle verboise at times have no ammo in this case. Yet every word is vintage King, his language and style shines through clearly in this tale abaout a werewolve terrorizing the typical small town. I recommend this book as an introduction to King because its short and I find it has everything that has become his trademark over his literary career, just in little less quantity than some of his other works. Cycle Of The Werewolf I would say is the appetizer to whet the readers' appetite for Mr. King's literary smorgasboard of fiction. As an added bonus there are beautiful black and white and colour illustrations throughout story by Berni Wrightson.	2003-07-09
US	30101572	R85LGBTO74KV6	1573228737	595147475	Affinity	Books	4	1	3	N	N	awesome	In a novel whose plot revolves around a spisterish lady in 19th century England who visits prisoners at the goal (prison), Waters shines as an author. Margaret Prior visits those lonely souls at the gaol in Victorian England where she meets Selina Dawes, a self-professed medium/spiritualist in prison for doing harm to a young girl and causing the death of her hostess. Reading this book I wondered to myself if Sarah Waters hadn't perhaps been in communication or channeling the spirits of Anne Radcliffe and/or Jane Austin as she was writing. Affintity is a sensous novel delicately written in a hybrid of gothic and Victorian styles with the sensibility of the 21st century. Waters' writing style is beautiful, her prose luminescent and descriptive without being overly descriptive as to take away from the plot. This novel is creepy, with high tension without being melodramatic or artificial. In short I happily recommend this novel to readers no matter what their tastes normally run to, it is suitable and appealing on many levels, to an eclectic audience. So if you're looking for a good Victorian novel but have read all the Bronte Sisters' and Austin's not to mention many other fine female novelists of the period go read AFFINITY.	2003-07-09

Candle Bay, having said that is also oh so much more. The plot and pacing are quick. The characters colourful, lively and intriquing. <BR>It tells the story of an assisant coiincierge just beginning work at a beautifully restored resort/hotel and spa. Unbeknownst to her the proprietors are a family of vampires.<BR>The suspense is well maintained throughout the story, and it is definitely a novel with positive possibilities of sequels. I also am impressed that Tamara Thorne makes obvious refernce to the vampiric works of Chelsea Quinn Yorbra(sp) even so far as making her trueblood impersonate Chelsea's vampire.<BR>Overall a great read for those fans of Vampire stories or those just looking to read something a little different.	2003-07-05

Jordon Glass is one of the most well rounded human characters I've met in recent fiction. Iles resists the temptation there must be to put his heroine on any type of pedastal and instead helps his character connect with readers by lending her strength because and in spite of her flaws.<br />The plot is relentless as Photojournalist Jordon Glass helps the FBI task force try to solve the mysterious disappearance of women(including her twin sister) whose images eerily appear in art. This novel is well researched pertaining to art world and the characters esaily leap off page into readers' imagination. Iles plotting pacing and characterization in this story lead me to call him a blooming literary maestro in his field. The ending while viewed by some admittedly as being hokey and contrived i view as uplifting testament to human spirit and thank you Mr. Iles for great read.	2003-06-16

What does that have to do with this review? Unfortunately I can not give this book the praise I have others at Amazon. <BR>Ex-alcoholic Paul Tobin gets a second chance to be a plastic surgeon at his brother in law's antiagaing clinic in the Keys. However the patients of this clinic are dying which is the driving point in the plot to this novel.<BR>Unfortunately though Steven Ford raises some timely issues, and his theme is intriquing its been done again and again in literature and fiction. His writing while clean and pure isn't exceptional enough to warrent a strong recommendation to readers who are not Mediacal thriller junkies anxiously waaiting Cook's latest book. Ford has his moments in this book that truly hint at his potential as writer and communicator of ideas using the thriller as his medium, for instance when Paul inevitably fell off the badwagon though not shocking or unpredicatably was handled in a manner that I did find myself rooting for him.<BR>My biggest complaint is that Ford deals with the shades of grey of such things as are acts of maliscious intent evil if there is good cause for them, again while skilfully done in parts on the whole I felt so removed from all characters I didn't really dwell on answer to that, nor was particu;ar;y unsettled by some of the passages that should have unsettled me maybe I'm just too jaded a thriller reader, maybe Mr. Ford's editor's over edited copy, or maybe this is an author on the way to hitting his stride but not quite there yet.

I finished this novel about Bernadette Kane, a womsn desperatly seeking answers, and perhaps revenge regarding her sister's death, who quickly succumbs to the sensuality of a mysterious pilot, who ulitmately unbeknownst to her might be more resposible for her sister's downfall, literally and figureative, than the man she holds responsible.<BR>Larry Brooks skill in combining suspense and eroticism is key to making this novel such a compelling read. As I read it there were parts I found disturbing, and didn't want to read but like an accident witness couldnt tear my eyes from the mark of a true craftsman in his trade. The \\"erotic\\" scenes are skillfully, and unflinchingly described without the forcefulness found is much of \\"erotic\\" description found in market today. <BR>His style is crisp and clean without being mundane or predictable in closing I most heartily and Lustily*wink* recommend this book as a must read anytime anywhere, but most especially as an entertaining summer read at the beach for those wishing a fast and furious escape in their fiction.	2003-06-10
