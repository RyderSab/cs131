I like easy to read book and I also had assumed that learning UNIX is not necessarily has to be a struggle. This book stood up to my expectations almost perfectly: it is very well written and clearly expressed work. It does not overwhelm with technical details and does not press too much. I also followed an advise in someone's review and purchased [[ASIN:B0015OGRZM Linux and UNIX for a beginner training suite, 4DVDs + 2CDs includes 4 Unix Academy Certifications ed.2008]] that is complete UNIX course recorded. It also comes with entire UNIX library that covers every subject beginner may think of. These two nicely complement one another. You watch it and you read it. If you didn't catch it from the first try you watch it again and read it again. In two months I found myself confident to that extend that gave advises to our system administrator and he accepted them because there were subjects that he wasn't completely sure. The DVD is also made on the basis of Apple's OS X Unix so they really work together. Sure it is a way to start there much of more advanced reading that will take over you with a time however these two provide you with the BASIS!   I can't overstate how much I have learned from them. Don't be naive, though. You will have to learn and memorize many things. The fact of owning neither book nor DVD will not make you knowledgeable, but if you will work it trough, trust me, you will surprise many people around	2005-09-29

It is very descriptive and well articulated and easy to read. I also have found here on Amazon training DVD \\"UNIX Essentials\\" that nobody knows about. It is very cool one, straight to the subject, very useful. I coupled this book with DVD and I believe I learned more then my friend who attended $2000 class.   This book is extremely useful provides plenty of relevant info.	2005-05-02

It is well written and it covers many useful subjects. This book offers as much for a beginner as it is possible to convey from the printed page. I pared this book with \\"UNIX Essentials\\" DVD that I have found here on Amazon and what is a nice couple they made! I learned in first two weeks that much that consulted our system administrator on some subjects! While the book provides more of conception the DVD course contributed to my workflow, they even have sent diplomas to me!    Try this book and work it through, it is a sure way to get some grip on UNIX.	2005-05-02

The problem is there's much of water, long blah-blah-blah and so on. It takes too long to start and then looOOoong leaps from one real problem to another. But it is \\"for dummy\\" book it supposed to be like that with all explanations back to the beginning.   I have found here on Amazon training [[ASIN:B0015OGRZM Linux and UNIX for a beginner training suite, 4DVDs + 2CDs includes 4 Unix Academy Certifications ed.2008]]. It is very cool one, straight to the subject, very useful. I coupled this book with DVD and I believe I learned more then my friend who attended $2000 class.   This book is good , but DVD is DVD, it is like you have class at home. This book is very useful though. When you start with UNIX it is like starting with violin:you have to practice every day and this book paired with the DVD gives much of what you will ever need.	2005-04-08

My friend, I'm not a professional photographer , I'm amateur, I'm in love with photography and thankfully to John Hedgecoe books my joy of it greater and reacher then ever! John Hedgecoe is unique, he is unique in this way that after decades of his super successful carrier and after dozens of published book he still enjoy photography. He never publish things like \\"this soft box on the right and this on the right side\\". He intrigues you to experiment to make you own way, he teaches you to see beauty, enjoy it and shoot it. I read his books as novels. I read it again and again because they clear, friendly and helpful. He like knowledgeable friend who helps you, who guides you and who loves you.   All photographers are sweet souls, because we love beauty, we looking, we hunting for it. And he still hunting for it despite time and experience, he's still not tired. You may have the simplest and cheapest camera but be encouraging you may take outstanding pictures and his books will help you to develop sense of harmony and improve your vision. if you are looking for book that will tell you \\"go there and do that\\" go elsewhere , it is not about it. But if you in the quest and would agree that it is always good to leave something to chance, to nature and to imagination you in the right place and John Hedgecoe is a right person to help you with that.	2004-03-06

There are many things to think of, analyze and try! It complement your creativity and had written like knowledgeable friend conversation style.<BR>For those reviewer who doubt John Hedgecoe's qualification. 50-mm lens could be wide if you use MF camera 6x6 for example. And photography it is art, it is not military style manual of actions. <BR>I proudly can recommend ANY of Hedgecoe's books as the best art of photography drills. It helps to develop photographic vision BTW, it helps a lot to understand composition. Learn before leave laughable reviews,	2004-01-05
