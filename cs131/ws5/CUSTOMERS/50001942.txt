Wanted in three states for various felonies, he found himself on a plane heading towards Chicago, with a broken nose, bloodied eyes, wounds on his cheeks, four teeth were missing, and basically no recollection of what happened. His parents met him at the airport and they drove him to the rehab center. In rehab, James wrote about the gruelling headaches and vomits, the difficulty of concentrating and just plain difficult. There, he became friends with a Las Vegas mobster, a judge, an administrator of a Catholic university and a former prostitute.  <br /> <br />This book is extremely disturbing and raw. James Grey was extremely graphic in his description of pain and suffering. He described having gone through root canal surgeries on two of his teeth without any medication and the picture that he painted was one very mesmerizing and yet disturbing. He was successful in describing his days in the rehab and his slow but successful completion of the program. I would not recommend this to anyone as it was very graphic and contained lots of expletives.	2005-10-14

In Alexander McCall Smith's latest installment of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, \\"In the Company of Cheerful Ladies,\\" Mma. Ramotswe and her assistant, Mma. Makutsi had to deal with several personal and work cases such as the intruder in Mma. Ramotswe's home, the case of a missing man who stole money from his company as well as Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's apprentice, Charlie who was seeing a rich married woman. In addition, Mma. Ramotswe had her abusive first husband, Note Mokoti who had come back to haunt her of her difficult past. Mma. Makutsi, on the other hand, had decided to join a dancing class, hoping to meet someone who could be a potential partner.  <br /> <br />Besides the first installment, this was my favorite book of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency. \\"In the Company of Cheerful Ladies\\" dealt a lot more with the characters' past, particularly, Mma. Ramotswe and in this book, the readers are able to see the vulnerable side of Mma. Ramotswe. As usual, Alexander McCall Smith was able to draw his readers into the stories with his vivid descriptions of his characters, making them seemed so personal. Can't wait to read the next installment. This is highly recommended!	2005-10-13

Tori Carrington's \\"Sofie Metropolis\\" centered around Sophie,  who left her waitressing job in her family's Greek restaurant and worked as a private investigator in her uncle's detective agency. As she discovered her husband to be unfaithful to her on their wedding day, Sophie decided to keep all the wedding gifts, including an apartment complex that her parents gave as their wedding gift. In her position as a PI, Sophie had to deal with a wide range of cases; from missing dog, to the disappearance of a neighborhood elderly (whom rumored had it became a vampire), to catching a woman who was supposedly having an affair. In the midst of this, her mother was constantly meddling with her affairs, especially parading eligible Greek men to Sophie. <br /> <br />I enjoy this book as the main character, Sophie, who constantly find herself in dangerous situations without meaning to. Some readers believed that this book is quite similiar to the Stephanie Plum series and I agree that there are some similiarities. However, this was more than just a mystery book as there is somewhat a \\"chick lit\\" theme to it. This was definitely a fun book to read.  <br />	2005-10-11

Lauren Weisberger's \\"Everyone Worth Knowing\\" centered around Bette, who left her job in investment banking and instead worked in a PR firm, helping the firm with organizing parties for celebrities, hosting events and others. In addition, the job also required Bette to meet up with people, be seen and basically party all night. Shortly after working for the PR firm, she was already making waves when a gossip column starting a rumor that she was dating Philip Weston, the hot and rich bachelor in New York City. The truth was she hardly knew the guy at all but because it was considered to be \\"good publicity\\" by her boss, she did not outwardly deny that. At the same time, Bette was always running into Sammy, the bouncer at a club that she and her co-workers frequented. Soon, the fine line between work and personal life for Bette began to disappear and she soon wondered if the job was worth it. <br /> <br />I thought this was a fun look at the world of PR people and the complexities of organizing or hosting events, the creative ways in which you get the media to cover your events. The character Bette was likeable enough, however there seems to be a lack of secondary development and I would have like to see the friendship between Bette and her best friend, Penelope developed more. If you are not interested at all to read about the glitz and glamour of the PR world, then this book is not for you.	2005-10-10

Jennifer Van Der Kwast's \\"Pounding the Pavement,\\" centered around Sarah, who was unemployed for six months after getting fired from her job as a Content Development Assistant. Sarah wanted to get a job in publishing but unfortunately she was stucked doing various temp jobs which she hated. However, in one of her temp jobs, she met Jake, who was also a movie fanatic like herself. Unfortunately, Jake seemed to be still carrying a torch for his ex-girlfriend. At the same time, Sarah's parents were breathing down her neck to get a job or go to law school which they would pay for. <br /> <br />I enjoy this book as I can relate to Sarah's situation as I have been there myself. I think many twenty-something females would be able to relate to the character. It was funny and very real when the author wrote about how temp agencies considered Sarah to be overqualified if she used her previous title, \\"Content Development Assistant\\" and should instead used \\"Administrative Assistant.\\" This is highly recommended for those who has ever been unemployed or currently unemployed, still seeking for the right job.	2005-10-07

She was unable to stay focused or committed to one thing for long and had always been fascinated with the idea of \\"new\\" things. This was due to the fact that she had been using \\"hand-me-down\\" things from her two older sisters, beautiful Charlotte and brainy Emily. Anne constantly compared herself to her sisters, feeling inferior as she was not known for anything and had not achieved anything. In addition, she became attracted to Charlotte's ex-boyfriend Ian whom she believed still had a crush on her married sister.  <br /> <br />This was an okay book for me as even though the book was fast-paced and at times fun, the main character Anne was a bit too whiny for me. Throughout the whole book, she was forever whining about how she was not good enough, how people overlooked her, etc etc. That being said, the book does has its funny moments which somewhat redeems itself. It's a light, and relaxing read. Not the best in this genre but just don't have high expectations.	2005-10-06

Tash Aw's \\"The Harmony Silk Factory,\\" centered around Johnny Lim, the proud owner of the Harmony Silk Factory who specialized in textiles in rural Malaysia during the 1940s. The book started in pre WWII where Johnny who was working in the tin mines stabbed a British who subsequently died and started working in a textiles shop. Johnny became popular and powerful and he had a secret; he was also a Communist. In addition, he was married to Snow, the beautiful daughter of the most powerful businessman in Malaysia. The story was told through three people; Jasper, Johnny's son, Snow and Johnny's British friend, Peter. Each person provided a different perspective of Johnny's story and each had his/her own secrets and burdens. <br /> <br />I really enjoy reading \\"The Harmony Silk Factory,\\" as the writer has a wonderful gift of transporting his readers back to 1940 Malaysia, under the British rule and awaiting for the Japanese invasion. He was also able to describe the surroundings in rural Malaysia vividly, bringing the social life in the 1940s to life. The characters in this book are just so unique and very well-written. The author took his time to develop his characters, bringing their personalities out subtlely. This book is definitely worth your time and effort.	2005-10-04

It was supposed to be a day of yoga, shopping, and having herbal tea, which was not what Zadie had in mind. However, the bachelorette party took a different turn and Zadie found out more about Helen than she ever wanted to know.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book as it was fast-paced, fun, witty, entertaining and many laugh-out-loud moments.

The author concentrates on a few big cities such as Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York City and Washington DC, mostly because these are the most expensive cities to live.  <br /> <br />What was helpful for me was that she provided some basic information about renting a apartment, what to look out for as well as contact information for utilities companies. Bear in mind that, if you're not living in those cities that the author covered, these information are basically useless for you. What was not helpful for me was that she gave too much emphasis on just starting out in general. I thought this book was suppose to concentrate on starting life in an expensive city, and NOT starting life in general. She wrote about credit cards companies, networking, job interviews and others which I felt was not necessary in this book. Those information seems too \\"elementary\\" for most people. Overall, this was an okay book... my advice is not to purchase this book but just to get it from the library and glance through it.	2005-09-29

Her father, an alcoholic who was unable to keep a job for long, would uproot the family to escape debtors as they were unable to pay bills. Her mother, a aspiring artist was also not pulling her weight around and who did not believe in having a job as she wanted to concentrate solely on her art. Jeannette, with her three sibblings had to rely on themselves for food and clothing. At the age of three, Jeannette suffered burns as she had to boil hot dogs over the stove and her dress caught fire. Hunger was something that all the children experienced frequently and Jeannette wrote about how she had to rummage through trash bins for other students' disgarded lunches.  <br /> <br />I was unable to put down this book as the author was able to write in such a mesmerizing way, capturing all the details and hardships that she and her sibblings had to endure. She was able to write in such a compelling way that I felt like I knew her family personally; their characters as well as flaws. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to read about the true story of a disadvantaged girl who through hardwork and persistence managed to overcome difficult obstacles to succeed.	2005-09-28

She had hoped that she would clear up her day to devote her time on writing a screenplay. However, Cassie was still able to get a job and hence began her bartending career. That proved to be a stepping stone as Cassie was able to get a bartending job for the summer in the exclusive Hamptons. Cassie soon realized that the Hamptons, frequented by multi-millionaires, were way out of her league. However, the job seemed promising enough even though the life of a bartender in one of the hottest clubs in the Hamptons was an incredibly hectic one. Between consuming alcohol as well as working like crazy at the club, Cassie soon realized that she did not have spare time to work on her script writing. Not to mention the sudden appearance of James Edmonton III, the dashing multi-millionaire who seemed to take a liking at Cassie. <br /> <br />\\"The Perfect Manhattan\\" provided a lot of insights into the life of the extremely rich at the Hamptons where designers' labels as well as country clubs seemed to consume its residents' time. The book also provided interesting glimpses of the life of bartenders as the authors were former bartenders themselves. I thought this was an okay book but the plot seemed rather thin for me. The entire book seemed focused on the Cassie's bartending job and it gotten dull for me towards the end of the book. There were not a lot development of supporting characters and they seemed to whiz in and out of Cassie's life rather quickly. It is not a badly written book but the constant subject matter of drinking and partying just seemed to lose its appeal half way through the book.	2005-09-26

She had tried all sorts of diet plans but she was never able to keep the weight off. It was a time of extreme difficulty for her as her parents divorced and she had to live with her maternal grandmother and later with her mother as both abused her mentally, emotionally and physically. It was hard as she was constantly taunt at school and for the most part, she was ignored. She tried seeking acceptance at home but to no avail. Her mother who was very violent was also very verbal when it came to expressing her disgust with Judith for being so fat. At the same time, Judith yearned for her father whom she believed would come and rescue her but he never seek her out.   <br /> <br />This was a captivating book as the author was brutally candid about her obesity and how others treated her. For readers who are or have been overweight, they can relate to her ordeal as it is not easy to live in a society that doesn't seem to accept overweight people. For readers who are not or never been overweight, it is an insight into the life of an overweight person. The writer has a writing gift as she is able to draw readers into her life and truly emphathize with her even though the writer wrote early on that it was not sympathy that she sought. I have to admit, the book was a bit depressing but it is truly worth reading!	2005-09-24

She started the memoir with her early life, moving from city to city due to her father's work and how she met the King Hussein and eventually won his heart. She wrote about the difficulties of being married to such an important man as well as being the stepmother to his children from his three previous marriages. Queen Noor provided lots of information concerning the Middle East history as well as politics which I thought was interesting even if it seems one-sided.  <br /> <br />I thought this was a rather interesting memoir to read about an American woman's unusual journey. I especially enjoy the personal aspects of her memoirs, such as her relationship with King Hussein as well as her acceptance towards Islam as her religion. Towards the middle of her book, Queen Noor focused quite exclusively to the Middle East politics at that time, writing on King Hussein's foreign and diplomatic policies. There were definitely insights into the various decisions that King Hussein made in \\"Leap of Faith.\\" It was also interesting to learn about the difficulties that both King Hussein and Queen Noor went through during the Kuwait invasion by Iraq where Jordan was isolated from their allies. This is definitely a fascinating read to learn and understand the journey of an American woman who became such a huge influence in the Middle East region.   <br />	2005-09-20

Franz was left at the altar when his fiance, Annie changed her mind five days before their wedding. In addition, his career took a step back when he was sort of \\"demoted\\" from his position. Feeling that two of the most important aspects of his life were letting him down, he had a idea to continue the honeymoon that he had planned with Annie and took his brother Kurt with him to Costa Rica. After their vacation there, both Franz and Kurt realized that they would like to extend their travel to one year, exploring different places. Franz also considered that an opportunity to get to know his brother better. Soon, their one year travel became two and it was more than just an adventure for both of them. Throughout their travel, they developed a better understanding and appreciation for other cultures and basically learning to appreciate the \\"little things\\" in life. It was a journey of self-discovery for both of them. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed \\"Honeymoon with My Brother\\" as the writing was witty and definitely very fun. The quirky observations of the author also made the book a very interesting read, seeing the different places through his eyes. This book can also be considered a travel literature/travelogue but better, as there were a lot of insights and personal stories. It wasn't just the travel itself that was fascinating but the relationship that was build between the two brothers as well as re-discovering themselves and their world. This book is definitely worth your time and money. Highly recommended! <br />	2005-09-20

Thinking that she did not have enough talent, Evie relied on her looks and clothes to keep the public and media interested in her to sustain her popularity. She never revealed herself completely to anyone including her best friend Kate, as she was betrayed in high school by her best friend, Louise. After leaving Jack, Evie moved in with Megan, who was completely taken by Evie and it was this time that she started receiving anonymous threatening letters. In addition, Evie had a secret that she kept since high school that had been burdening her and at the same time, she was terrified that it might be revealed which would demolish her career. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed \\"Solo\\" as I felt that all the characters, particularly Evie, were extremely well-developed. The author took her time to give her characters depth rather than rushing through the whole book. Even though the characters had flaws, one can't help but root for them. In addition, the author's writing is clear and very conversational, which makes this book such a delight to read. This is my first Emily Barr's book and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a relaxing read.	2005-09-14

Personally, I did not feel connected to the main character Alison because I find a bit annoying as well as whiny. She chose to be the \\"victim\\" and subjected herself to be humiliated by Pepper. There were not a lot of secondary characters development as the book seemed to focus solely on Alison's disdain for Pepper as well as her unending attraction for Spencer.

Lia was formerly a B-grade actress in Hollywood who just left her husband in the theater and went home to Philadelphia, carrying with her a burden that she can share with no one. Becky worked as a manager and chef found herself sharing her pregnancy with two other women whom she met by chance in Philadephia; Kelly, an event planner and Ayinde, the wife of a professional basketball player. On paper, all women don't seem to have anything in common but due to motherhood, they were all brought together to share the joy and downside of motherhood. Each woman had to deal with her own issues and problems.  <br /> <br />This is my second book by Jennifer Weiner and I feel that this book was very well-written. She managed to engage her readers from the beginning to end, developing her characters carefully, and slowly reveal to us the characters' personalities. All the characters had their flaws, and this made the characters seemed more \\"real\\" and one can't help but like each one of them. In addition, unlike some authors who have a tendency to rush things at the end, Weiner was able to finish the book nicely. This compelling book is highly recommended!	2005-09-02

She was, however, determined to succeed in the company.  <br /> <br />I thought this was a so-so read as this was nothing new or different in this ever growing genre. I was engaged for the first half of the book as the author did provide some interesting insights into working for a production company. However, the rest of book dealt with the same thing as the first half and my interest began to diminish especially when there seemed to be no development whatsoever in Karen's personal life. It was strictly concentrated on her job and nothing else. It was all about the chaos in her workplace as well as Karen's backstabbing co-workers. It was an okay read for me and I would recommend this book if you are very interested in the inner workings of a movie production company.	2005-08-31

In addition, Mma Ramotswe was also having a dilemma of her own as her fiancee, Mr. Matekoni did not seem to be in any hurry to fix a date for their wedding and she was getting tired of waiting. In this book, Mma Potokwane, the owner of the orphanage that Mr. Matekoni frequently went was getting pushier than ever.  <br /> <br />It seems like the \\"No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" has evolved from its very first book. In his first two installments, the author seemd to play a bigger emphasis on cases for Mma Ramotswe to solve wherelse the next three books were focused primarily on the book's characters.

Mireille Guiliano's \\"French Women Don't Get Fat: The Secret of Eating for Pleasure,\\" deals with the different ways in which Americans can lose weight, without taking any drastic measures such as crash dieting or any other diet fads. The author made it clear at the beginning of the book that her target audience was women, American women to be more specific. She gave her observations on the eating and lifestyle habits of both the French and American and basically showed the differences and where the Americans went wrong.  <br /> <br />Her suggestions on losing weight were very practical.

I thought that her ideas/suggestions were very practical... it's not anything new. The way she presented her observations or ideas was effective, more in a \\"essay\\" manner as opposed to \\"here's what you need to do... step 1, step 2, etc.\\" This is definitely worth your time and money!	2005-08-20

Three years later, she returned to Silver Creek after leaving Stephen in a gas station. Kat was not sure why she returned to Silver Creek as in a way, she had been running away from her past. Some things had changed and some had not. She found out that her great aunt Eva, who raised her was dying, while her relationship with her uncle Charles was still strained after all these years. In the meantime, Kat was not sure whether her decision to return was right. <br /> <br />This was an okay book for me. I was not very engaged as a reader as the main character was unlikeable, difficult and the secondary characters were not fully developed. In addition, the constant flashing back of Kat's past was unpleasant for me. However, this is not your regular chick-lit as the book is deeper, and more thought-provoking. I think this is a great improvement to Karen Brichoux's first novel, \\"Coffee & Kung Fu.\\" I recommend this book for those who would be interested in a story of a young lady returning to her hometown to search and understand herself.	2005-08-18

Samantha's life revolved around her work, and she was constantly on the phone as well as emailing. After seven years of working at Carter Spink, she believed that she had a good chance of being made a partner at the firm. Samantha came from a family where career was more important than anything else and she assumed that was how it was supposed to be. However, one day, Samantha noticed a memo written to her by one of the partners, Arnold, to complete a task. She had forgotten about it completely and now her client actually lost 50 million pounds because of her carelessness. Shocked at her own carelessness, Samantha just left the office, took the train and wound up outside of London, in the countryside. Due to some misunderstanding, she had gotten herself a job as a housekeeper for a couple. As she had never done any housework in her life, this soon proved to be a challenging task.  <br /> <br />I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella but I am quite disappointed in \\"The Undomestic Goddess.\\" The plot is too predictable and a bit far-fetched too. It's hard to believe that the character Samantha can be transformed into a housekeeper so easily. In addition, I find that Samantha is too similiar to the character Becky in the Shopaholic series. Other than that, this was still a rather interesting read as the it's fast-paced and the writing is clear and concise. Definitely worth a try!	2005-08-16

Melissa Bank's \\"The Wonder Spot\\" centered around Sophie, a Jewish woman with two brothers who had been hopping from one job to another. At the beginning, we were introduced to a 12 year-old Sophie who was struggling with her Jewish identity, and at the same time was quite rebellious. It was in general a difficult time to be growing up with two brothers and a mother who wanted Sophie to emulate her cousin. Later, the story jumped to Sophie's time in college. She became good friends with her European roommate and she had her share of boyfriends. The other half of the book chronicled Sophie's quest to search for a job that she liked. Basically, she was involved in editing/publishing, advertising, researching and a couple other things but never finding success in any of them. Her relationship with women and men were equally unsuccessful. <br /> <br />I have never read Melissa Bank's previous book so I did not have much expectation in \\"The Wonder Spot.\\" I enjoy the beginning of this book where she wrote about Sophie's struggles as a teenager. Melissa Bank was able to let her readers gain a deeper understanding of the character Sophie as well as the secondary characters, consisting mostly of her family members. However, the other 2/3 of the book was quite \\"messy,\\" in my opinion. The time frame was never explain clearly, relationships that ended without explanation and at times, it feels like the author was jumping back and forth which makes it quite confusing. I was quite disappointed as the book had a promising start.	2005-08-14

As she somehow stepped on the wrong foot of the \\"Queen\\" of soaps, Meredith, Kate's role as Devon switched sexual orientation! Not having any problem with that and trying to stay clear of Meredith's way, Kate gave her best to the role and it became a huge hit! Soon, Kate was travelling to soaps convention, Emmy awards, and etc. However, the only problem was, she was falling in love with her leading man, Wyatt, who happened to be the husband of Christine, her only friend in Los Angeles. <br /> <br />I enjoy \\"Soapsuds\\" as it provides a great insight into the lives of soaps actors and actresses. It may seems like it's easy work but there are lots of long hours involved as well as the pettiness of the people in the industry. The author, Finola Hughes was afterall a soaps actress herself and she was able to provide lots of \\"insider information.\\" However, the book is extremely long and it can get quite tedious sometimes as in addition to having keep up with the real plot, I find that I have to keep up with the plot of \\"Live for Tomorrow,\\" too. Not to mention, the scripts for \\"Live for Tomorrow,\\" was a bit too much I think. Nevetheless, this is still an interesting read and I think \\"Soapsuds,\\" appeals to both soaps and non-soaps fans!	2005-08-12

Across from their apartment, there was Domenica, an elderly woman who befriended Pat, and she was somewhat a eccentric but insightful lady. Below their apartments, there were Bertie, a five-year-old and her mother Irene. Irene was somewhat a bossy mother who believed that Bertie was a child prodigy and insisted on him taking saxophone and Italian lessons despite her child's protest. In addition, the author also threw in glimpses of Edinburgh high society and portraits of the city itself which made this such a delightful read. <br /> <br />Through these colorful characters, the author also dealth with issues such as friendship, love, and basically human relationships. I enjoyed this book for the author's vivid descriptions of his characters which made them seemed so real. I am an avid fan of Alexander McCall Smith's \\"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency,\\" and his writing in this book is far different from the series. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a fascinating read!	2005-08-09

Makutsi, hoping to earn extra money set up the Kalahari Typing School for Men, which became a hit.<br /><br />I have enjoyed the other books in this series and this was equally delightful. The author focused more on the main characters' daily lives and their problems as opposed to actual cases. It's great that the readers get to learn more about the characters but at the same time, it would be better if the author had provided more cases for Mma. Ramotswe and her assistant to solve. Nevetheless, this is still a great book; it's easy to read, the characters are likeable and it's basically a fun read.	2005-08-08

Things changed when Declan's movie on World War II was released and became a blockbuster hit. Soon, their lives were transformed and they were getting Hollywood A-list treatment everywhere they went. However, Kyra soon learned that their popularity came with a price; constant stalking by the paparazzis and fans, intrusions into their private lives, and basically they became public properties. Soon, Kyra began to question if this was worth it. <br /> <br />I have enjoyed Laura Caldwell's previous two books, \\"The Burning Map,\\" and \\"A Clean Slate,' and had high expectation of this book. \\"The Year of Living Famously,\\" is well-written; the characters are well described, it's fast-paced and it provides an insight look into the life of the rich and famous. However, I feel that book is not as engaging as her previous two and that there were not many secondary characters development. Despite that, it's still a great read and better than average chick-lit! I am looking forward to Laura Caldwell's next book.  <br />	2005-08-05

First of all, it is extremely important to read Emily Giffin's \\"Something Borrowed,\\" in order to understand \\"Something Blue.\\" In the earlier book, we see things from Rachel's perspective but in \\"Something Borrowed,\\" we see things from Darcy's perspective. After disovering that her fiance, Dex had cheated on her with her best friend, Rachel, Darcy was determined to move on and proved that Dex had made the wrong decision. At the same time, we also learned of how Darcy cheated on Dex with his groomsman, Marcus and she became pregnant as a result of that. It was all quite complicated and it became worse when Marcus did not want to have anything to do with either Marcy or the baby. Feeling that everyone had betrayed her, Darcy determined to start all over again in London, and bunk in with her childhood friend, Ethan. However, Darcy learned that it was not going to be as easy as she thought.  <br /> <br />In \\"Something Blue,\\" we learned a lot more of Darcy's character, that she was spoilt, self-centered, shallow and at the same time whiny. Even though Darcy is all that, the author was able to present the character in such a way that you won't despise her. It's great that after reading these two books, you get two opposing perspectives and realized that both characters are truly flawed but definitely very \\"real.\\" Rachel, we learned in the earlier book was envious of Darcy because Darcy was the pretty one, and guys flocked to her. Darcy, on the other hand, was jealous of Rachel's intelligence. This is definitely one of the better chick-lit books. It was well-written, and the characters were very \\"real\\" and definitely very vividly described. Definitely worth your time and effort.	2005-08-03

Miranda enjoys her job immensely and is successful at what she does. Her love life however is not so great. Fresh from her breakup with an upcoming TV star, Miranda is determine to move on, with the help of her best friend.

The plot was clearly written, the characters were likeable (especially Miranda's best friend, Daisy) and I find the problems that Miranda's clients had with their pets simply fascinating. The author also did a great job in keeping certain parts of the books a mystery to engage her readers to continue reading the book. Overall, this is a better than average chick-lit!	2005-08-01

At the same time, there were fear in people as there were killings which the Ministry believed were the doings of Lord Voldemort's Death Eaters. I n general, it caused chaos in both the Muggles and the Magical worlds. <br /> <br />The sixth book is in my opinion, one of the \\"darker\\" books in this series. In this book (spoilers alert!), we learned more about Lord Voldemort's background; his family, personality, friends and more importantly his ambitions. At the same time, there were relationship developments among the main characters. This was not the most exciting Harry Potter book for me and I was also surprised to find that there were no \\"twists\\" at the end, as compared to the other books. However, I feel that in this book, Rowling provided more background information which will prepare her readers for the ultimate showdown between Harry and Voldemort in her seventh book.	2005-07-31

Later, she went on to describe her education years and how she was shaped by the events that took place. It was interesting for me to know that she grew up in a Republican family and was actively involved in the Young Republicans in high school. It was in Yale that she finally met Bill Clinton.  <br /> <br />The other half of the book covered the Clintons years in Arkansas as well as in Washington D.C. Hilary went in great details about the Clinton administration as well as its domestic and foreign policies. In addition to that, Hilary mentioned about her involvement in the health care reform, as well as the Whitewater affairs. One of the things that most readers looked forward to was her thoughts on the Monica Lewinsky affairs and Hilary did touch on that... however, she did not go into much details her thoughts on that or how she did manage to forgive him (if she did at all). <br /> <br />I find the early part of this book the most interesting... especially dealing with her early childhood and how she became who she is today. I find the later part of the book a bit too boring as I feel that she was in a defensive mode especially during the various scandals that hit the Clinton presidency. Still, this was a rather interesting autobiography of Hilary Clinton.	2005-07-11

Lastly, Sekky, was the youngest son as well as the sickest, and hence, he received the most attention, particularly from his grandmother. All three had to struggle with their parents who tried their best to retain their \\"Chinese ways,\\" as well as dealing with the peer pressure at schools and trying to conform to the rest of the population.  <br /> <br />This was quite an interesting novel that provided a clear picture of life in the 30s as well as 40s in Chinatown, Vancouver. I thought it was especially fascinating when the author dealt with the last sibbling as we were able to see life during World War II through the eyes of an eight year-old; the anti-Japanese sentiments as well as the patriotism of the overseas Chinese. This is highly recommended for those who would like to know more about Chinese traditions and cultures as well as life in Chinatown Vancouver during the 30s and 40s.	2005-05-30

However, I am pleasantly surprised that some of her ideas are quite practical and doable and they were not as expensive as I thought. A useful book to have. I would also recommend Carley Roney's \\"The Knot: Complete Guide to Wedding in the Real World\\" which I think provides even more detailed information.	2005-05-22

Things took another turn when she managed to sign on Mark Swan, one of the hottest director in Hollywood to direct their organization's movie. What more, Mark Swan seemed to take a liking to Anna. In the meantime, Anna was involved with Charles Dawson, one of England's most eligible bachelor who happened to be a millionaire. Even though Anna was not in love with him, Anna felt that at least there was someone who appreciated her.  <br /> <br />\\"The Go-To Girl\\" is a so-so chick lit as the romance between Anna and Mark was never fully developed. In addition, the heroine, Anna, was a bit too whiny for me and I don't find myself rooting for her. She was constantly feeling sorry for herself. There are definitely better books out there in this genre. Nevertheless, this was still a relaxing read. Just don't expect too much.	2005-05-18

Soon, he developed feelings for a mysterious local Burmese by the name of Khim Myo. As the days went by, Drake realized that he was unwilling to return to England as he found his whole experience in Burma exciting, unlike anything he was accustomed to.  <br /> <br />It took me quite a long time to finish reading this book as I was not able to \\"get into\\" the story. As other reviewers wrote here, there were too many loose ends and the ending was most unsatisfactory. The pace of the book is extremely slow and I feel that there was never really a plot.

Alessandra was a young girl who appreciated art, history and literature and she frequently found herself at odds with her sibblings. She was curious and rebellious in her own ways. Despite the mentality that women were not encourage to be artists, Alessandra discovered that she had the interest and the talent to draw even though her family would not have been approved of it. One day, her father brought a young painter to live with them and he would be commissioned to paint their chapel. Her interest in the painter as well as his work grew. In the midst of this, a monk by the name of Savonarola was seizing political as well as religious control in the city of Florentine. The city soon became violent and extremely turbulent. <br /> <br />The setting and backdrop of \\"The Birth of Venus\\" reminded me a lot of \\"The Girl with a Pearl Earring.\\" The strength of this book is definitely the ability of the author to draw her readers into the story. She was vivid in her description of the culture and politics at that time, making it easy for her readers to imagine what it would be like to live in Florentine during that period. This work of historical fiction is highly recommended for those who want to know more about Florentine in the late fifteenth and sixteenth century, through the eyes of a young woman named Alessandra.	2005-04-15

However, Lloyd was accused of leaking confidential client information and was fired from his job. Initially, Suze believed that Lloyd was guilty but soon, she realized that things may not be as simple as she thought.  <br /> <br />This is relatively a simple and straightforward story that deals a lot with working lives. Initially, I feel that the pace of the book was too slow for my liking and the characters were not very interesting. However, midway through the book, the pace picked up and the plot thickened (even though it was rather predictable). This is a rather average chick-lit in terms of characters and plot. What attracts me to this book is I like the idea of two people swapping job, and living in foreign cities.	2005-04-14

Oskar lived with his mother across from his paternal grandmother. He had a difficult time getting over the death of his father and one day, he accidentally broke a vase and inside the vase, he found a key. They key was inside an envelope and the only clue Oskar could find was the word \\"Black\\" written on the front of the envelope. Determined to find the source of the key, Oskar came to a conclusion that the word \\"Black\\" refers to someone's last name and sought to look for every person with the name \\"Black\\" in New York City. Thrown in the midst of this were letters written from his grandmother and grandfather. These letters provided background information on Oskar's family, revolving particularly on the relationship between his grandparents.  <br /> <br />I think this is quite an interesting read as the author's style of writing is very different and unique. I find it confusing at the beginning, unsure of who is writing to who. However, as I continue reading, it became clear to me the entire plot of the story. The author did a great job in engaging his readers to the story, wanting his readers to continue reading to find out what happened. His characters were likeable and at the same time, you feel like you know them personally. It's definitely different from your everyday fiction. Worth reading!	2005-04-12

Sue Monk Kidd's \\"The Mermaid Chair\\" revolves around Jessie, a stay at home mom, who felt that she was drifting apart from Hugh, her husband of 20 years and was just uncontented in general. One day, she received a call that her mother had intentionally cut off one of her fingers and she needed to return to Egret Island, in South Carolina to help her. Egret Island was a place that Jessie spent most of her childhood and was also the place that she sworn to escape when she was an adult. This was because Jessie carried the burden of guilt that she played a part in the death of her beloved father in an accident. However, she needed to go home and it was her first day there that she felt in love with a monk named Brother Thomas. In Egret Island, it was a place that she could escape from her husband but at the same time, she became more confused with her relationship with Brother Thomas as well as with her mother, feeling that there was something more to her violent act of cutting off her finger. In essence, Jessie had to deal with understanding and accepting the past as well as making choices for her future.   <br /> <br />\\"The Mermaid Chair,\\" deals with themes such as love, betrayal, friendship among the characters. Sue Monk Kidd did a fantastic job of making her characters seemed so real and you can't but help feel that you know each of them personally. The main focus of this book was mostly about the relationships between the characters and the choices that had to make. The setting of this book was quite interesting as the author provided a lot of information on the Lowcountry culture and lifestyles. Overall, I think this is a great read and would highly recommend it for everyone who wants a thought-provoking read.	2005-04-10

Alison Pace's \\"If Andy Warhol Had a Girlfriend,\\" deals with Jane, who works for Dick Reese, who owns a prominent art gallery in New York, who has just been dumped by her boyfriend, Jack. Even though Alison liked her job, she could not stand Dick Reese. Even more annoying was when Dick assiggned Jane to manage Ian Rhys-Fitzsimmons's art fairs in five different cities for a total of five months. As Ian was Dick's No. 1 Client, there was no way Jane could get out of it and on top of that, Jane believed that Ian was bizarre and a fraud who just knew how to sell his sculptors. As Jane travelled from one city to another, Jane soon learned that Ian may not be as bizarre as she thought and as she began to understand Ian's art, she was also learning more about herself. <br /> <br />\\"If Andy Warhol Had a Girlfriend,\\" is definitely fast-paced, fun, interesting (to learn more about galleries and art fairs) as well as heart-warming. It seems more like a \\"smart-kind-of-chick-lit,\\" and the characters are very likeable. In addition, it wasn't one of those whiny, all about love, on and on about the same thing kind of chick-lit and this makes the book such a delight to read. This is definitely one of the better chick-lits out there. If you are looking for a sweet, funny, and fun book, this is highly recommended to you.	2005-04-06

Ramotswe found herself having to manage her fiance, Mr. Matekoni's garage as he was acting strangely and unable to function. In order to manage both the detective agency as well as the garage, Mma. Ramotswe promoted her assistant, Ms. Makutsito be the Assistant Manager of Mr. Matekoni's garage. In addition, Mma. Ramotswe had been hired to investigate a case of food poisoning and possibly murder for an important government official while Mma. Makutsi undertook her first detective case without Mma. Ramotswe's guidance.  <br /> <br />In \\"Morality for Beautiful Girls,\\" the author seems to be more focused on the development of his characters as we learned more about Ms. Makutsi as well as Mr. Matekoni. The focus on the secondary characters helps to make this third installment of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency a much stronger book. In addition, I like that the author came up with very different cases in each of his books which makes the book such a delight to read. This is definitely worth reading if you have read the previous two books!	2005-04-05

Kate has a somewhat dysfunctional relationship with Jake who seemed to take advantage of her and who does not treat her well. For some reason, Kate was unable to break it off with Jake, partly because she loved him and partly because she wanted to build a family with him. Kate's life was turned upside down when Mirri, a old actress as well as a sex symbol showed up at Leonard's door step to stay for the summer. Mirri was the exact opposite of Kate and was on Kate's nerve constantly as she was always giving her advice which Kate felt she didn't need. However, Kate realized rather unwillingly that Mirri, in fact, had a thing or two to teach about men.  <br /> <br />It was quite a predictable read as there aren't many surprises along the way. The strength of this book comes from the development of the characters. The characters had their faults and weaknesses but by the end of the book, they have come to a realization of what's important and became more mature. It was also interesting to read about the relationship between Kate and Mirri and how they have grown to rely on each other for help. Their friendship, I think, was the highlight of this book. This wasn't the best chick-lit I have ever read but it's still better than average.  <br />	2005-04-01

Matekoni, the owner of a car repair shop in Botswana. Unlike the first book which dealt a lot more with cases, this installment deals with just two cases. In the first case, an American lady who lost her son in Botswana ten years ago had returned to ask Mma. Ramotswe's help to find out what exactly happened to her son and in the second case, a butcher would like to find out if his wife was cheating on him. Alexander McCall Smith was able to provide more depth in these two cases, more so as compared to his first book. In addition, the author also provided more details about Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni in the sense of his character. Thrown in the midst of this was the maid of Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni who felt threatened by Mma. Ramostwe's presence, as well as the new role that her secretary Mma. Makutsi, will assumed. <br /> <br />In \\"Tears of the Giraffe,\\" the readers get to know more about Mma. Ramotswe as well as her fiance, Mr. Matekoni. The author is able to vividly describe their personalities as well as their surrounding. Also in this book, we understand the connection that Mma. Ramostwe feels towards her country and its people. In addition, I enjoy the cases in this book and appreciated the way in which Mma. Ramotswe solved them. She once again proved to be a wise, inquisitive and compassionate detective. For those who are hard core mystery fans, this is not the book for you. However, if you are interested in learning about Mma. Ramotswe and the simple but effective ways she solved her problems, then this is highly recommended.	2005-03-30

Emily Giffin's \\"Something Borrowed,\\" deals with Rachel who has been best friend with Darcy since they were in elementary school. Even though they have very different personalities, they were very close and treated each other like sisters. On Rachel's 30th birthday, Darcy threw Rachel a surprise party and it was also on that day that Rachel slept with Darcy's fiance, Dex. Rachel thought it was an \\"accident\\" and claimed that they were both drunk but slowly she realized that she did have feelings for Dex whom she met when she was in law school. It was through Rachel that Darcy met Dex. Soon, Rachel was cheating with Dex behind Darcy's back and at the same time, planning Darcy's wedding for her as Rachel is the maid of honor. <br /> <br />\\"Something Borrowed\\" is fast-paced and definitely engaging. I finished reading the book in a little over one day. The book touches on topics such as friendship, love, and betrayal. The author did a great job in develop her characters as well as the relationships between them. Their personalities are vividly described. I think the author is risky in the sense that her heroine is a cheater and that might not work well for some readers. It is hard to root for someone who betrays her friend, no matter how much the friend deserves it. My only complain is that I think the author ended the book too hastily. I feel that some issues remained unresolved. Overall, I enjoy the book and would recommend it to chick-lit fans as this book is unusual in the sense that the heroine is the cheater unlike other chick-lit books out there where the heroines usually assume the role of the \\"victim.\\"	2005-03-28

Toor talked about her relationship with various pets; mouse, rat, dog, cat, donkey, and horse. Through each of those pets, she learned something about the animals, especially their characters. Besides her pets, Toor also wrote about the relationship that she had with various men, and the lessons that she learned from each of them. Some of the relationships that she formed with them actually lasted beyond even after they broke up. In fact, two of her ex-boyfriends actually formed a \\"R.E.B.\\" which stands for Rachel's Ex-Boyfriends. <br /> <br />This is quite a well-written book as the author is witty, funny as well as knowledgeable. I like that she was able to explain vividly her relationships with all her pets and was able to learn a lot about them; their characters, their likes and dislike. From the way she wrote about her pets, there is no doubt that this author has great passion and love for animals. This is certainly a fast-paced and entertaining read!	2005-03-27

Jhumpa Lahiri's \\"The Namesake,\\" deals with the life of Gogol, an American-born Indian who struggled to deal with the dual identity that he carried. His parents, Ashoke and Ashima, came over to the United States from Calcutta and had more or less adapted themselves to the foreign culture. Their children, Gogol and Sonia however were very different in their mentalities compared to them. Gogol struggled all his life to deal with his name as the name \\"Gogol\\" was only suppose to be a pet name; something that his parents or relatives would used. He was in fact named after a Russian writer, Nikolai Gogol. His good name was \\"Nikhil,\\" one that would appear on the diploma, driving license, etc. However, due to some unforseen circumstances, \\"Gogol\\" became his official name. Gogol struggled with that as he wanted to blend in with his American friends and felt that his name was too different. As he reached eighteen, before going to college, Gogol resorted to change his name back to \\"Nikhil\\" and felt that he could finally fit in with the rest of the crowd. <br /> <br />On the surface, this book seems to deal a lot with names; good names, bad names and pet names. However, far beyond that, Jhumpa Lahiri touches on the issues of first generation born Indians in the U.S. who had to struggle to fit in, as well as their relationships with their parents. Gogol's relationships with his parents became strained when he did not want to be raise like he would in India, as well as having to accept that his parents would be very different from his friends'. The author did a great job in her descriptions of her characters as well as the relationships between them. Her writing was clear and descriptive. She was able to engage me from the beginning to the end of the book. I highly recommend this book!	2005-03-22

Both had very different family background; Amir, the only son of a rich and powerful businessman while Hassan's father was a servant in Amir's family. Both Amir and Hassan spent most of their free time together despite having very different personalities. Amir, was cowardly while Hassan was brave as well as having unquestionable loyalty for Amir. However, one incident changed the course of their lives forever. It was also during that incident that Amir betrayed Hassan and Amir would regret it for the rest of his life. Behind the storyline was the setting of Afghanistan before the Russian took over as well as during the Taliban's reign.  <br /> <br />This was one of the most captivating book I have ever read. The author is able to draw his readers into the story with his writing. The characters in \\"The Kite Runner\\" are definitely memorable. It almost seems like you know them personally. In addition, the author touched on many themes here; friendship, betrayal, relationships as well as redemption which makes the book such a delight to read.

As usual, she was addicted to shopping, buying multiple of things she don't need and having them shipped secretly back to London, without Luke's knowledge. Eager to return home after her long honeymoon, Becky was in for a surprise when her parents introduced her long-lost sister, Jess to her. Becky was especially eager to have a sister as she felt that her best friend, Suze, had replaced Becky while she way away. Unfortunately, Jess was totally different from Becky and winning her heart would prove to be very challenging.  <br /> <br />Even though many people find Becky's behavior to be annoying and irritating, I find that this is still a fun book to read, especially if you have been following the Shopaholic series. It's fast-paced, sweet, and contains many funny moments. The way Kinsella ended her book, there may be possibly be a fifth book of this series. This is definitely a must-read book for all Sophie Kinsella's fans.	2005-03-17

Fortunately for Molly, she met Molly, an Australian traveller who showed her the ropes as well as introducing her to a bunch of people. At one party, she met Fabrice, the Parisian who took it upon himself to show Molly around Paris at the wee hours of the day.  <br /> <br />\\"Weekend in Paris\\" is quite a fun novel, what with Molly's travelling in Paris, and meeting different people. I agreed with some reviewers who thought that the storyline was a bit unreal especially Molly's romance with Fabrice as well as travelling with a stranger that you just met in a place that you have never been to. Despite that, it is still a fun and relaxing read. It's not the best chick-lit out there, but it's better than average.	2005-03-16

This was mainly due to the fact that she was dumped by her boyfriend Mike on Valentine's Day. Despite having broken up with Mike a year ago, Liv found that she was still unable to have a serious relationship with any guy, feeling that guys just don't like her. Her family and friends were all actively getting her to be more sociable, setting up dates, etc, which she hated. The only stable thing in her life was her work until she met Drew, her housemate's friend whom she thought could possibly be a good candidate. In addition, she was \\"visited' by three spirits of Valentine's Day which could possibly change her mind about Valentine's Day and dating in general. <br /> <br />I thought this was quite an interesting read. It was a bit different from the other chick-lits out there and thought that the scenarios dealing with the three spirits were quite funny. I think the author did a great job developing the character Liv, making her readers understand the decisions that Liv took, as well as introducing us to Liv's past. The book is fast-paced and contains many funny situations which makes it quite an entertaining read!  <br /> <br />  <br />	2005-03-15

Ramotswe, who is the only female detective in Botswana. With the money that she received from the sale of her deceased father's cattles, she started the agency despite skepticism from others. Despite the fact that it was unusual for a female to be a detective, Ramotswe was able to solve cases using her intuition, creativity as well as intelligence. Her cases are usually small such as finding a kidnapped boy, uncovering a bogus father, etc.  <br /> <br />This is a light read and rather enjoyable as the author brings his readers through the different cases and the creativity that Ramotswe used to solve the mysteries. The heroine is extremely likeable and has a great sense of humor. In addition, the author was able to bring in bits and pieces of Ramotswe's past which I find very informative and interesting as it shaped Ramotswe to become the strong person that she is. I highly recommend this book for anyone seeking a relaxing and fun read.	2005-03-11

On top of all these things, there are problems, issues, and stories of the Mitford folks that Father Tim had to deal with. <br /> <br />\\"At Home in Mitford\\" is a warm, funny and sweet book that deals with small town personalities and living. Through the eyes of Father Tim, we get to see interesting as well as eccentric characters in Mitford that we can't help but relate to.

As their bridesmaid, Cate was expected to handle all sorts of emergencies on their wedding days such as the wedding drunk, the disgruntled mother of bride, the ex-boyfriend who wished to crash the wedding, etc. After being the bridesmaid for the third or fourth time, Cate was in fact sick of it. At the same time, Cate was feeling left out that her friends seemed to be getting hitched while her own relationship with her boyfriend, Paul seemed to be going nowhere.   <br /> <br />I think it's quite interesting to read about Cate's account as bridesmaid and the things she had to go through, from the bridal shower to the actual wedding day. However, I wouldn't say that this is the best chick-lit I have ever read because I think it's only slightly better than the average. The pace is a bit too slow, and there isn't a lot of plot in it. That being said, it's still a rather fun and easy read.	2005-01-25

Watching the trial intently, was Ishmael Chambers, who owns the local newspaper, as well as Kabuo's wife, Hatsue. Throughout the trial, there were flashed back of family histories and how their lives were interconnected in the small community in San Piedro, Washington.  <br /> <br />I am not a huge fan of courtroom drama but this one was able to hold my attention. It starts off slowly but once you get into their stories, it is quite interesting. I like that the characters were written very well and at the end of the day, you feel like you really know them personally. In addition, I also enjoy the bit of history that the author provided regarding the Japanese-American internment during World War II. This is definitely a fascinating read!	2005-01-17

Sarah Mlynowski's \\"Monkey Business\\" deals with four students studying in business school at the University of Connecticut, whose paths crossed when they all stayed at the same dorm and all four became friends. However, all four of them come from very different backgrounds and have very different personalities. Jamie falls into the category of class clowns who seems to cracking jokes constantly but who is really into Kimmy, a gorgeous woman who went to business school to get over the fact that her boyfriend dumped her for her best friend. Then, there is Layla who seems to be the only one taking business school seriously and who wants perfection in everything she does. Lastly, there is Russ, who is a Canadian and spends most of his time smoking pot and who seems to be late for every class.  <br /> <br />This is definitely a fun look at campus life and it brings back some memories for me of my own campus experience. It's interesting to read how the four main characters paths were crossed and how their deal with their individual problems. That being said, I think this is not Mlynowski's best book as I have read all her previous works. The characters in \\"Monkey Business\\" were not very likeable and more than half the book deals with their everyday lives on campus which I thought were not exactly thought-provoking. In addition, the book seems to be lacking in humor as compared to her other works. However, even though the book has some flaws and could be better, I still enjoyed it and would recommend it for chick-lit fans.	2005-01-06

She was visiting her boyfriend who was stationed in Indian temporary to cover the news in that region. MacDonald wrote about the people, culture and mostly religions. She covered quite a few of the religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and others; basically predominant religions in India.  <br /> <br />This was just an okay read for me. I enjoy her writings on the sights and sounds of India especially when she wrote about the culture and the people. The second half of her book was a bit of a bore for me as she seemed to focus completely on religions. It was interesting at the beginning but later it seems to be a bit too much and I felt that I was reading the summary of a religion textbook. If you are into religions in India, this is definitely the book for you. If you aren't, this is only a so-so read.	2005-01-02

Sam wrote about working for JC Penney and that was how he knew he wanted to be in retailing. He also wrote about the challenges and competition that he faced and how he overcame those to create such successful stores nationwide. Throughout his book, Sam talked about his working philosophy such as using associates as partners, treating the customers right, encouraging creative ideas and also thinking ahead.  <br /> <br />I truly enjoy this book as I have always been fascinated with Wal-Mart. Even though I thought that I know a lot about Wal-Mart but this book reveals to me there are tons of things I am not aware of. Sam touched on things such as how the name \\"Wal-Mart\\" came about, how they started having people greeters at the entrances of every stores, how he dealt with competition from Kmart, and others which I feel are quite insightful. Sam also showed true entrepreneur spirit by his willingness to take risks, having a great vision, thinking ahead, tons and tons of hard work and not afraid of failings. Even if you are not interested in Wal-Mart or retailing in general, I still think this is a great book to read as there are definitely tons of valuable learnings. Detroit Free Press, I thought summarizes this book really well by saying that, \\"Here is an extraordinary success story about a man whose empire was built not with smoke and mirrors, but with good old-fashioned elbow grease.\\"	2004-12-07

Langdon learned that the scientist could be murdered by the Illuminati, an ancient brotherhood thought to be enemies of the church and basically religion in general. In addition to the murder, the murdered scientist's creation of anti-matter, which was a deadly weapon was missing. Langdon soon found himself inside the Vatican City with the murdered scientist's daughter, Vittoria, investigating the whereabout of the anti-matter and whether the Illuminati really did resurface after all these years. <br /> <br />Fans of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" would be equally impressed with this book. The chase, the conspiracies, the arts and architectures were all interwoven to make this such a thrilling read. Dan Brown is able to write in such a way that leaves his readers wanting for more. This was suppose to be a bedtime book but the more I read, the more awake I get. It is unbelievably addictive. In addition, I feel that I have learned quite a lot about the Vatican City especially matters concerning the Pope and the Catholic Church. I also find the debate between science and religion to be pretty interesting and thought-provoking. This is definitely a must read book for who love history, arts, conspiracies, or just thrillers in general.	2004-11-29

It is a very unique relationship as Clare has to deal with Henry sudden disappearance or sometimes Clare gets to meet two Henries - the present Henry and the past Henry.<br /><br />I was a bit hesitant to read this book as I felt that the whole time travelling business might confuse me but the author did an extremely good job in explaining the whole process and once you get the hang of the idea, it is easy to focus on the story. The story is so original, so unique that it is hard not to fall in love with it. Half way through the book, I felt as though I knew Henry and Clare intimately and was able to relate to their predicament. It is difficult not to care about them or their relationship. The ending of the book is extremely compelling and I wish that it didn't end. This is one of the best fiction that I have read this year and it is definitely worth your time and money!	2004-11-22

Anne Frank's \\"The Diary of a Young Girl,\\" provides an interesting account of life under the Nazi rulling during World War II. Anne's family, together with another family went into hiding at Anne's father old office building. In her diary, Anne detailed how their daily lives were and the fear that they had of the Nazi discovering their \\"Secret Annex\\" as they called it. Anne's meticulate observation of everyone was clearly noted in her diary which provided insights into how difficult their lives were, especially since they were constantly in arguments, which were unavoidable due to the fact that eight people were living together in a confined space.<br /><br />I truly enjoy this book as it gives a different perspective of life under the Nazi. Not to mention, observations coming from a fifteen year-old was also unusual. After finished reading the book, I felt that I know Anne intimately; her personality, values and thoughts. At the end of the book, the publisher provided information on what happened to the eight people in the Secret Annex. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand how it would be like to live with eight people in a confined space for a long period of time. Truly insightful!	2004-11-02

The author was able to paint a realistic picture of Burma, together with its social and political scenes. Rajkumar met Dolly, a young maid of the Burmese princesses and fell in love with her. Even though the Burmese royal family was set exiled to India by the British Empire, Rajkumar knew that he would somehow find her. Which of course he did and the author vividly described the many characters that they met and how the couple build friendships that lasted for decades. \\"The Glass Palace\\" also span through three generations and the author depicted how lives intersected and the relationships that were built.  <br /> <br />I think this is an extremely engaging book as it has a bit of everything. It has history, family saga, love, and war as well as dealing with issues such as slavery racism, and the fight for freedom. The author was able to skillfully blend all these elements to make this book a memorable one. The book also displayed the author's vast knowledge of this region especially its history and politics. Besides that, Ghosh was able to vividly describe his characters and really brought them to life. This is definitely a keeper!	2004-10-19
US	50001942	RWSPEGVMFIVUC	0393059227	545162178	The Sari Shop	Books	4	1	1	N	N	An interesting read!	Rupa Bajwa's debut novel, \\"The Sari Shop\\" deals with the life of Ramchand, who worked as a shop assistant at the Sevak Sari House in Amritsar since the age of fifteen. The work itself is quite monotonous for Ramchand except for the occasional chat and gossip among women who came to the shop looking for saris. Through the eyes of Ramchand, we see the competitiveness nature of these women, their ideals and values and the class problems that existed in Amritsar. In essence, Ramchand's life was uneventful. That changed when Ramchand was asked to bring some saris for Rina Kapoor, the daughter of a rich businessman in Amritsar and had a glimpse of what it was like to be rich and educated. Through all this, the author also introduced different characters in her book. These includes Kamla, the drunkard wife of Chander another store assistant at Sevak Sari House, Lakhan the food seller who lost his son, and a few others. The author also depicted how the lives of these characters intersected with one another. <br /> <br />I enjoy this book as I like the way the author vividly described the streets in Amritsar or the personalities of the shop assistants at the Sari shop. The author was able to make her characters \\"come alive.\\" The pace of the book is slow, but do not be deter by that. It is definitely the style of the author and it seems that she took her time to make her readers understand and emphatize with her characters. My only suggestion is that I wish the author provided some transition when she moved from Ramchand's life to Kamla's as she did it quite rapidly which left me wondering at that point what happened to Ramchand. Other than that, it is definitely worth investing your time in this book.	2004-09-27

It didn't help too that Lauren's employer (by the nickname of \\"G\\") is insufferable and out to make life miserable for Lauren. Besides work, Lauren, a recent divorcee, wouldn't mind meeting another man who can filled the place her former husband left. Then comes, Nick, a hunky firefighter who managed to save Lauren twice during her clients' disastrous weddings. Lauren can't believe that someone like Nick would be interested in someone like her. However, Lauren soon discovered that Nick was in fact engaged to one of her most difficult and important client, Darla. Lauren knew that pursuing anything with Nick would mean an end to her career. <br /> <br />I think this was an okay chick-lit. I definitely agree with the other reviewers here that the author used too many parentheses in her writing. It totally disrupts the flow of the book and the author could just have said what she wanted without any parentheses. In addition, I find that this book is extremely predictable. Half way through the book, I can more or less tell the entire plot and there was no suspense whatsoever. The other thing that I didn't like about the book is that there is hardly any secondary characters development, which is a shame as I think it would definitely strengthen the book. However, it is still rather interesting to read about Lauren's analysis of brides, the MOBs (\\"Mothers of Brides\\") and just weddings in general. It's basically an okay read... just don't expect too much from it.	2004-09-21

Griet was an exceptional young lady as she was observant, intelligent and very much in tune with paintings despite her humble background. In Vermeer's home, Griet had to deal with the insufferable mistress, Catharina as well as her children and the other maid who was hostile to Griet and considered her a threat. Not to mention, Vermeer trusted no one but Griet to clean his studio, which others don't have access to. Soon, Griet became Vermeer's \\"unofficial\\" assistant; grinding colors for his paintings, giving him suggestions and basically inspiring him. The author also explained one of Vermeer's most famous painting very vividly. She also did a fantastic job of characterizing their tension and feelings for each other. In the midst of this, there was also the local butcher's son who was out to woo Griet. <br /> <br />I really enjoy this book as I find Chevalier's writing very eloquent and at the same time, easy to understand. She was able to vividly describe the unspoken feelings that Griet and Vermeer had for each other. Using the first person narrative, we are able to see the confusion and the excitement that Griet felt for Vermeer even though she knew nothing would come out of it. In addition, Griet was also dealing with the other members of Vermeer's household who became suspicious of the relationship between Griet and Vermeer. Besides the fact that this book was very well-written, I enjoy the historical background the Chevalier provided for her readers; such as the setting, the mentality of people in 17th century Holland, the roles of women in the society, and etc. It is obvious to me that Chevalier knew her subjects very well and were able to bring out their personalities which make the characters come alive. This is definitely one of the better historical fiction around.	2004-09-09

As one can imagine, there were tons of paperwork to muddle through on top of an extremely long waiting period. In addition to her personal account, Evans did a nice job of explaining the situation in China, whereby the one-child-only policy is being practiced and the impacts it has on the Chinese people, particularly girls who were abandoned. Besides that, Evans also provided historical background revolving the Chinese people who placed enormous emphasis on boys whom they believed will \\"continue\\" the family line.  <br /> <br />One of the things I like about this book is that Evans provided sources for all her statistics. I think it is important that these data are supported to make a strong argument. In addition, I also like the fact that she provided meaningful remarks from various authors and scholars which was thought-provoking. That being said, I do think there are a few weaknesses in this book. Evans have a tendency to repeat herself throughout the entire book and that her book lacks a certain structure. I think the book could be better structured and organized to avoid repetitions. In addition, I think Evans to a certain extent romanticized the mothers who left their daughters behind. She was speculating on how the mother of her adopted daughter would feel, and so on. I thought that was unnecessary as it was pure speculation. Overall, I gave it a three and a half stars because I thought the book did provide some valuable and interesting information on adoption but I think the book was too long for what Evans wanted to convey.	2004-09-02

That would be quite difficult considering Terzani's job as a journalist. Considering that as a challenge, Terzani travelled by trains, buses, and cargo ships which sometimes take days to arrive at his desired destination. In each of the countries or places that he visited, he would seek to find the local fortune-teller/shaman/sorcerer to learn about his fate and his life. Soon, Terzani learned that travelling by land despite its delays do have its benefits. He was able to take things at a leisure pace, learn more about the local people and cultures, and basically see sights that he would have otherwise missed if he was travelling by plane. <br /> <br />At the beginning of the book it was an interesting read for me. I like that Terzani includes anecdotes, personal accounts, and his meticulous observations of local communities. He proves to be very insightful in all the countries that he visited, including their political scenes. In order to know accuracy of what he said, you would have to be quite knowledgeable and aware of the politics in that region. But for other average readers, they may not be aware of such things. Hence, I would think the book is more solid if Terzani includes footnotes or bibliography which would be helpful. He frequently makes comments that are unsupported by any references or sources. In addition, I wish he would deal more with the local cultures as opposed to his obsession to find and consult every famous fortune-tellers in every places that he visited. It WAS interesting at the beginning but by the time he reached Mongolia, I was quite bored and have had enough of fortune-tellers. Lastly, like most reviewers here, I thought he was just like a \\"typical\\" Westerner who wants rural areas in Indo-China tobe just the way they were, unaffected by globalization so that others like him could see the place in its \\"pristine\\" state. Not at all taking into consideration the poverty that these communities have to endure and how modernization would improve their lives tremendously. Hence, Terzani presented a very lopsided view of issues such as this. It is still a rather fascinating read, especially if you are into Buddhism, fortune-tellers, or  the Southeast Asia region in general.	2004-08-20

Karen Brichoux's &quot;Coffee & Kung Fu&quot; storyline is like most chick-lits these days; single girl, alone in the big city with a job she hates. In addition to that, the heroine, Nicci, has a unique &quot;love&quot; life in the sense that the only reason she is out with her client, Rob, is that he's great in bed. Even though Nicci knows she can't connect with Rob and they don't seem to have a &quot;real&quot; relationship, she is still willing to stick with him. Then, she met Ethan, from a coffee shop whom she thinks has a &quot;rainbow smile&quot; and Nicci feels she can connect to. In essence, Nicci is not satisfied and unhappy about her life which she feels is going nowhere. Nicci still longs for the days when she was living in the Phillipines with her missionary parents compared to her current drab life. However, there is one thing that seems to cheer Nicci up - Jackie Chan's kung fu movies. An avid fan, Nicci is trying to relate real life incidences with those in the movies. (Mind you, these are not Jackie Chan's current Hollywood movies, but his older Hong Kong ones). Unfortunately, Nicci realizes that it's not quite that simple where in Jackie's movies, good guys always win, or that people would beat up other people to avenge their families' deaths. Something similiar like that. <br />  <br /> There are many reviewers here who thoroughly enjoy the book but I must confess that I am not one of them. I wasn't able to relate to Nicci and that the storyline in general wasn't able to engage me. The book seems to be about nothing in general and the storyline wasn't solid enough. In addition, I find the book a bit boring and depressing for me because Nicci seems to be such a difficult character. She finally did the right thing at the end but throughout the book, she is constantly unhappy and she doesn't do anything about it. I wouldn't say this book is bad but it's definitely not one I would recommend to others.	2004-08-04

The authors used empirical findings from Hewitt Associates' Best Employers studies to support their arguments. The book is basically divided into three main sections; Leadership and Talent, Engagement and Execution and A Framework for Sustainability. The first section dealt mainly with the importance of leadership in an organization, how it is crucial to have a clarity of purpose for their employees and the importance of getting the right talent and making sure the talent stays with the organization. The second section dealt mostly with having the right culture and engaged employees will create great business results. In the last section, the authors provided some trends that they foresee (such as diversity in the workforce, blurring of work and personal life, etc) and some implications for the organization and HR. Basically, they concluded that being a Best Employer is not an easy or an overnight thing. Leaders need to align business strategies with people strategies and also to make sure employees' needs are taken care of. It also takes a lot of commitment from leaders to ensure employees are engaged with the organization. <br />  <br /> This is an easy to read book as the writing is very conversational. There are some HR jargons but I think the authors did a great job explaining them. The content itself is not earth-shaking because what they talked about is nothing new in this field but it is still nevertheless a useful book to have as they are able to support their arguments with Best Employer Studies' results and finding. In addition, I like the fact that the authors were able to illustrate their points with case studies of the Best Employers in Asia.	2004-07-29

Like many people, I have tried many different diet programs and nothing seems to work. I have heard about this book from the newspaper and decided to read more about the diet before jumping into it. Seeing the positive results of so many people and that the book seems to make sense, I decided to give it a try. In fact, I had a pre South Beach Diet phase (Phase 0.5?). I cut down on carbohydrates gradually and once I am sure what type of meals I can prepare, I started my Phase 1. I think it works for me this way as it would be extremely difficult to be someone who eats tons of carbs daily to none at all. <br />In Phase 1, I eliminated all carbs from my daily meals. However, I cheated a little with fruits because I have hemorrhoids and constipation problems. I think it is crucial to tailor the diet to your own needs and not follow everything strictly. Not to mention, I didn't feel like having Metamucil daily.  I also had occasional coffee. Regardless of that, I loss about 9 pounds during Phase 1. Now I am on Phase 2 and I still plan to eliminate most carbs from my diet but less strictly compared to Phase 1. <br />I think it is crucial to get the book even though there are many websites out there with advice, suggestions and other things. It's important to get the entire picture before starting out the diet. In addition, the book comes with plenty of recipes and meal plans which would be helpful. The hardest part for me is deciding what to eat daily (besides salads) and the book is a great resource for me. The first few days are the most challenging as the tendency to give up is high but after surviving that, it will be much easier. This is not an easy diet plan but to me, it is easier compared to others.	2004-07-16

One day, Christopher discovered that his neighbor's dog, Wellington, was killed with a garden fork and he would investigate the matter to find out the killer. In addition, he would document all his investigations in a book. However, Christopher who do not comprehend emotions and human beings in general, this would prove to be a difficult task. Through all this, we get to learn more about Christopher, the autistic boy. Everything to Christopher was about logic and math. He does not like to be touch, he hates places with lots of people and noise and he doesn't like the different food on his plate to touch. <br />I think Christopher Boone is a most fascinating character. The author did an extremely good job in characterizing Christopher and is able to bring him to life. He was able to tell his readers how Christopher's mind works and how he would react to things in general. For someone who has never encounter an autistic person like me, this book is very insightful and I truly feel that I have learn something. It was also interesting how the author charaterizes Christopher's parents; his father was able to handle Christopher's difficulties while his mother was unable to cope with the pressure of having an autistic child. I highly recommend this book as even though the story seems simple, it is actually not. It touches on an important subject that I feel people are in general ill-informed and unaware.	2004-07-15

Thankfully, her best friend, Laney was at her side to give her all the encouragement and support that she needed but despite that, Kelly was still not able to remember the events between her birthday and now. However, Kelly felt that something important happened during those months but she was at the same time too afraid to find out. Putting it behind her, Kelly was eager to start a new life and pursuing her interest in photography full time.<br />I think this is one of Red Dress Ink better books. It is definitely a lot more thought provoking than your regular chick lit. The author did a fantasic job of characterizing Kelly and is able to bring her to life. In addition, I like the relationship between Kelly and Laney which I thought was well developed. In addition, the book was very well-written, great secondary characters, and good plot. The whole \\"thing\\"  that Kelly forgot but knew it was important was quite intriguing and the author was able to keep her readers guessing. This is a more serious chick lit compared to the rest and it is definitely worth your money. Laura Caldwell is certainly a promising writer in this genre.	2004-07-02

According to Blanchard, it is crucial to provide recognition appropriately to either co-workers or family members. He uses the example of training the killer whale, Shamu at the SeaWorld. When it comes to training killer whales, trainers have to reward the whales when they do something right to reinforce the same behaviors and that it is basically useless to punish killer whales if they make mistakes.<br />I think this is an okay read because there are basically nothing new here. However, I do like the &quot;training of killer whales&quot; illustrations that help to reinforce what Blanchard is saying - rewarding animals/people appropriately. Like a few reviewers here, I do prefer &quot;Who Moved My Cheese?&quot; and &quot;Fish!&quot; better. I also agree that some of the lines in &quot;Whale Done!&quot; are sort of cheesy. It's basically an okay read.	2004-06-19

Eddie, a war veteran, was somewhat of a loner and who felt that he did not accomplish anything in his life and that his life was basically wasted. These five people were a combination of loved ones and strangers who impacted Eddie's life or Eddie impacted their lives. Each person taught Eddie a lesson and from these lessons, Eddie will developed a deeper understanding of his life and his actions. <br />I truly enjoy this book as I find it utterly mesmerizing. Once I started reading the book, I was hooked. It is fascinating to see who is the next person that Eddie will meet and why this or that person is one of the five people. The good thing is you can never predict who are these people and that is why the book is truly amazing. Some reviewers were not satisfied with this book for various reasons; some felt that the story seemed unbelieveable and some felt that the way Mitch Albom explained heaven is problematic. It is crucial to realize that this is fiction and just like Albom's bestseller &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;, this is also a simple story.  I highly recommend this book along with others such as &quot;Life of Pi,&quot; &quot;Bel Canto,&quot; and  &quot;The Secret Life of Bees.&quot;	2004-06-17

During a business trip in New York City, Sam left her diary at a hotel there and it was coincidentally pick up and read by Ben, a television producer. Sam was extremely freaked out about losing her diary as she wrote things such as how her superior came on to her, her best friend's affair, among other things and Sam was afraid that her diary might ends up in the wrong hands. Ben intrigued by what he read was eager to meet with the owner of the diary and showed up outside Sam's apartment and was greeted by Sam's roommate, Gemma, whom Ben thought was Sam.<br />I have never read a book by Jane Sigaloff and I must admit I am not very impressed with this book. There are so many directions that the author is going and it can be extremely confusing. She seems to be jumping from one thing to another and on top of that, tons of conversations by tons of people are taking place, which makes it hard to stay focus and concentrate. The idea (girl lost diary, boy found the diary) is there but the author fails to develop a solid storyline. In addition, the romance between Sam and Ben was barely there and the author seems to &quot;put&quot; them together for the sake of it. The author also fails to create chemistry for her two main characters.  It is not the worst thing that I have ever read but there are definitely better quality books in this genre out there.	2004-06-10

Amy relied heavily on a bestselller book called &quot;Baby How, Baby Now&quot; on what she should be doing during her pregnancy, etc. However, Amy became obsessive (she thought that she had various diseases or complications) as a result of the book. In addition, she was easily irritated with everything as she had to keep up with the fact that she was pregnant and had to keep it a secret from her co-workers (she had just joined the company). <br />It was an okay read for me as the storyline is extremely predictable. Amy lines were at times quite cheesy and dramatized. Unlike the first novel, I feel that this book was not fun and humorous. I understand that the author is trying to accomplish the same goal as her first book; by showing how Amy became obsessive as a result of a book but it just didn't seem to work in &quot;Diary of a Mad Mom-To-Be.&quot; It is still a rather entertaining read but it is not one of those books that would make you yearn for more.	2004-05-27

The group of hostages consisted of Roxanne, a well-known soprano singer from the United States, Mr. Hosokawa, the president of a corporation in Japan, Gen, the translator and others. Soon, the hostages understood that they were not going anywhere and hence they formed relationships with their kidnappers.

Ann Patchett did an excellent job as I really feel that I know her characters personally as she is able to make her characters come alive. This book is well-written, smooth, and there are definitely some poetic expressions that help to enhance the book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a relaxing yet meaningful read.	2004-05-16

The authors went into details of what dresses are suitable for what body types and they touched on factors such as the silhouettes, sleeves or no sleeves, trains, the back, necklines and bodies. They also provided information on accessories such as veils, shoes, lingerie, and gloves which are quite helpful to the bride-to-be. In addition, the authors also gave advice on where to get the wedding dresses, and how to take care and preserve the them.<br />I think this is a useful book to have for those (including me) who have no idea of how to select the right wedding dress. The authors provided basic to very detailed information that I think would be good to have before actually selecting a dress.

As a publicist, Alex was expected to spin stories, attend parties, cater to the needs of her clients, and basically, making sure her clients receive the right publicity. Her life became more complicated when DWP was merged with another rival company BIG. Her work which was very demanding to begin with became unbearable when there seemed to be divisions in the newly formed DWP-BIG and Alex wasn't sure which side she was on or should be on. <br />I think &quot;So 5 Minutes Ago&quot; is quite an interesting read as it provides glimpses into the life of a publicist in the ever-changing, competitive and shallow Hollywood. The book provides insights such as the work that goes into making sure an actor becomes a celebrity or the importance of appearing in various functions/events. The author seems very knowledgeable in this area which makes the book insightful and at the same time fun. In addition, the characters in this book are very vividly described, which is definitely considered a strength. Definitely an entertaining read!	2004-05-12

Shortly, she started having an affair with Geoff, a married man himself who is 23 years older than Sidney and is also her father's partner in a law firm. Her relationship with Geoff was different as it was mostly sexual (he didn't stay overnight, can't be seen in public together, etc) and soon Sidney realized that she was falling in love with him. In the meantime, there were other men who were interested in Sidney.<br />I didn't enjoy \\"Appropriate Men\\" as about three quarters of the book deals with Sidney's relationship with Geoff and by then I was getting bored. It is hard to be \\"into\\" the book as the main story is Sidney's relationship with Geoff, which is going nowhere. In addition, it is hard for me to like Sidney as she seems to be an intelligent character and yet she was willing to put her life on hold for an unattainable man. In addition, the book does not have any strong secondary characters (which would make the book livelier) as the author seems to focus entirely on Sidney. This is definitely not your average Red Dress Ink book as this book deals mostly with infidelity unlike others. I think there are definitely better chick lits out there.	2004-05-11

Lily was miserable and lonely and decided to run away with Rosaleen, her father's worker. With the words &quot;Tiburon, S.C.&quot; written on the back of a &quot;Black Mary&quot; picture that her mother owned, she set off to Tiburon with Rosaleen. There, Lily discovered a whole new world of love and bees.<br />I really enjoy this book as the author is able to make her characters seemed alive. The author touched on the subject of racism and how &quot;colored&quot; people were treated with much hatred. For instance, she showed how it was totally unacceptable in the society for a white girl to be living in a house full of &quot;colored&quot; people. It is also interesting for me to see things from a fourteen year old's perspective. Lastly, she touched on the subject of love and how we might find it in places we least expect. It is definitely a mesmerizing book!	2004-05-08

Jennifer Crusie's \\"Bet Me\\" deals with Min who was dumped by her boyfriend David who made a bet with Cal, (a gorgeous and charming guy who gets any woman he desires) that Cal would not be able to take Min out for dinner and bed her in a month. Cal, however was not interested in the bet but Min overheard bits and pieces of the conversation and she was convinced that Cal was taking the bet. Playing along, she went out with Cal for dinner and soon, Cal seemed to creep into her life. Min was torn between her feelings for Cal and the fact that she thought he was only interested in her because of the bet. In the midst of this, David who was convinced before that Min would not be interested in Cal had second thoughts and tried to win Min back in order not to lose the bet. Then there is Cynthie who was Cal's ex and believed strongly they are destined to be together forever.<br />This book is entertaining and the characters are interesting. Crusie also wrote very well the sexual tension between Min and Cal. However, my only criticism of this book is that, the length of \\"Bet Me\\" is a little long as the entire book deals with the bet and after 200 pages or so, Crusie is still writing about that. I was a little bored and feel that the book could definitely be shortened. Regardless of that, it is still a relatively entertaining chick lit.	2004-05-05

The memoir covers the time when Firoozeh's family spent two years in the U.S. after her father was transferred to Whittier, California. She talked about how her family discover things such as the American game shows, Las Vegas cheap buffet, camping among others which were extremely fascinating to them. The author mentioned several problems that she had to face such as the language barrier, friends not being able to pronounce her name and just assimilating into the American culture in general. Firoozeh went back and forth between her childhood and her adulthood (when her family finally settled permanently in the U.S.) lives.<br />Firoozeh is certainly observant and there are times where I find myself laugh out loud. There are many sweet and humorous moments especially dealing with her thrifty and hardworking father. The book deals a lot with discovering the country, and understanding the culture through the eyes of an immigrant. In addition, the author also covers serious issues such as discrimination that they faced during the Iran hostage situation where her family was treated poorly just because they were Iranians. I feel that I learned a lot from this book, especially concerning the Iranian family values, and the problem that immigrants had to face. Overall, it is an interesting and insightful book, though I do wish the author would arrange her book chronologically or in a more meaningful way instead of going back and forth. The paperback edition also includes an additional chapter which covers her family's reaction to her book.	2004-05-03

Initially I was a little skeptical about plot of this book but I decided to give it a try since it receives so many good reviews. Boy, I am thankful that I gave it a chance. &quot;Life of Pi&quot; by Yann Martel deals with Pi, a sixteen years old boy from India who was stranded on a lifeboat with a hyena, a zebra (with a broken leg), an orang utan by the name of Orange Juice, a 450 pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. The beginning of the book dealt with the early childhood of Pi, the son of a zookeeper and who was a believer in Christianity, Islam and Hinduism. Soon, due to hardship, the family decided to migrate to Canada. On the way to Canada, the ship they were boarding sank, and suddenly Pi found himself thrown into a lifeboat in the middle of nowhere, with all those animals. Soon, Pi realized that the how grave his situation was; he  was lost, and worst still with a 450 pound tiger as his companion. The rest of the book dealt mostly with Pi's situation, how he kept himself alive - both from the lack of food and water, and from Richard Parker. <br />This book is truly amazing. It is eye-opening to see what a boy can do to survive. I have never read anything as clever and mesmerizing as this. This is definitely NOT your typical fiction. The characters are lovable and personalities of the animals (particularly Richard Parker) are just fascinating. There are many hilarious moments in this book. For instance, I love the explanation of how a Bengal tiger was named &quot;Richard Parker&quot; or when Pi's family became aware of Pi's three religions.  I highly recommend this book as it is one of those rare books that you will always remember reading and wish the story never ends.	2004-04-29

The three leadership truths are: 1) The CEO and Board of Directors should provide leadership and inspiration (actively involved in leadership processes) , 2) A maniacal focus on high-potential leaders (identify the best talent and providing challenging assignment for them) and 3) Doing the right programs the right ways (developing programs that would help enhance leadership skills). However there are other &quot;Little Things&quot; that organizations should also considered in terms of building leaders such as communication, paving the way for social networks, fostering reciprocity and others which are seemingly unimportant issues or frequently overlooked, but are actually crucial for organizations. These are explained in great details in the book. Finally, the authors feel that leadership programs in general should be link directly to the organization's business strategy.<br />The last chapter in &quot;Leading the Way&quot; deals with future trends that organizations need to face in order to be successful and five rules that the authors feel were curcial to develop leadership capabilities. I think overall, this is a useful book to learn and understand about developing leaders as the authors provided examples, and anecdotes which are useful in terms of illustrating the authors' point of view. My only criticism of this book is that I wish the authors had structured it better within each chapters. There are many subtopics within each chapter which can be a little confusing and can be combined. However, I do find the short summary in each chapters helpful.  Anyone who is interested to know more about developing leaders should definitely read this book.	2004-04-21

Da Chen's \\"Sounds of the River\\" is a sequel to his first autobiography \\"Colors of the Mountain,\\" which deals with his university days studying English at Beijing. \\"Sounds of the River\\" picked up where \\"Colors\\" ended. Chen wrote about the difficulties that he faced as a country boy travelling to a big city like Beijing and how he had trouble adjusted to living among the city folks. Once in Beijing, Chen realized that he needed to start from zero as he had difficulties comprehending and speaking English. Since he did not come from either a political background or a city, he was constantly looked down by some of his teachers and fellow classmates. However, Chen managed to survive as he studied hard and was determined to succeed. Later, Chen realized that he wanted to leave Red China and pursued his \\"American dream.\\" (Not going to give it away here on how he had finally left China)<br />I really enjoy his second book. I was very mesmerized by \\"Colors of the Mountain\\" and wanted to know what happened next. I enjoy his quirky observations of life on campus and the people that he encountered such as - the department's dean who needed to be bribed with oysters and lycees, his roommate Bo who was into high fashion, as I find them colorful and interesting. \\"Sounds of the River\\" is well-written as Chen is able to express his thoughts vividly to his readers. There are many funny moments and there are times that you can't help but relate to his ordeals. Some readers might also appreciate his poetic expressions. I think readers who are interested in this book should definitely start with his first, as it is crucial to know his family background, and experience to fully appreciate \\"Sounds of the River.\\"	2004-04-14

Years later, they met again at a conference and realized that they never got over each other. The love that they felt for each other when they were children were still very much alive now that they both reached adulthood. Both characters had inner conflicts that they need to deal with. For Pilar, the main character in the book, was one who never did leave her village and who sought to lead a peaceful and predictable life was drawn to childhood friend. She was torn between leaving something that she is familiar with (returning to her village, get a husband, etc) and following this man to new places and learn new things. For him, he was torn between the love he felt for Pilar and the fact that he believed he has the ability to perform miracles and therefore heal the sick. <br />The story started out nicely enough until the author decided to concentrate mostly on Catholicism. For those of us who are not Catholics, it is difficult to understand the Catholics' heavy emphasis on Virgin Mary. At some point, Coelho seems to place equal importance between Mary and Jesus. I agree with one reviewer who said that the book cover of this book totally neglected any mention of Catholicism and gave the impression that it was a love story. I honestly did not enjoy this book, and feel that there are much better books out there. However, if you are a die hard fan of Coelho, this may appeal to you as his unique writing and poetic expression is very much visible in this book.	2004-04-01

It is a simple prayer asked by a man named Jabez who prayed to God that He would bless him, expand his territory and that the Lord's hand would always be with Jabez and keep him from evil. God did grant Jabez for what he requested. Wilkinson showed how this simple prayer can be extremely powerful.<br />Wilkinson explains each of the verses (of the Jabez Prayer) and how we can apply it to our lives. I thought it was interesting how Wilkinson noted that Christians take for granted the word &quot;bless&quot; as it is so overly used. He pointed out that asking God to bless us is actually &quot;crying out for the wonderful, unlimited goodness that only God has the power to know abour or give to us.&quot; It is a short and easy to read book with a simple yet important message.	2004-03-28

Her plane encountered turbulence and Emma thought that it was going down and she was going to die. In her frightened state, she blurted out some of her darkest secrets to the good-looking guy sitting next to her. Some of her darkest secrets are the fact that she isn't sure if she has a G-spot, faking her Math grade on her CV, watering her co-worker's plant with orange juice, and that she thinks her boyfriend, Connor is a tad too boring for her. Suddenly, the plane landed and Emma thought that was it.<br />Until on Monday when she walked in to her office, and the stranger that she met on her flight turned out to be none other than Jack Harper, the CEO of Panther Cola. She was both terribly frightened (the fact she might get fired for lying on her CV) and embarassed. In fact, Jack was more terribly amused and taken by her. Soon, Emma began to feel attracted to Jack. <br />I really like &quot;Can You Keep a Secret?&quot; as it is such as fun and funny read. There are times when I literally laugh out loud. Like all her other &quot;Shopaholic&quot; series, this book is fast-paced and is able to engage its readers well. Her characters are well-developed and likeable.

Unfortunately for them, something happened (don't want to reveal everything here) that broke their relationship and soon they were on their own. <br />I really enjoy reading this book. I have no idea who Rita Rudner was... received this book as a gift. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments but I feel that this book is more than just that. Rudner deals with issues as such friendship, family and forgiveness. The characters are wonderfully developed... you feel as though you really know Mindy and Ursula. In addition, it gives me insights into the world of stand up comedians and the things that they have to overcome in order to be successful.

Collins and his research team selected eleven great companies and contrasted with their comparison companies (who they feel are average) to understand why some companies make the leap and some don't. The team discovered that to be a good to great company needs to have a Level 5 leadership. Level 5 leaders are leaders who are humble, fanatically driven, understand the need to produce sustained results and they set their successors for even greater success in the future. The leaders also understand the need to get the right people in their organization before figuring out where to drive it. As Collin puts it \\"First who, then what.\\"<br />In addition, they understands the \\"Hedgehog Concept.\\" To quote directly from Collins, a Hedgehog Concept is a concept \\"to understand what your organization can be the best in the world at, and equally important what it cannot be teh best at - not what it \\"wants\\" to be the best at.\\" It is \\"not a goal, strategy or intention; it is an understanding.\\" It is also essential for the organization to build a culture of self-disciplined people (as getting disciplined people would limit the bureaucracy needed to compensate for lack of discipline), uses technology wisely (avoid technology fad), good to great transformation doesn't just happen with one single action, no grand program but instead follows a pattern of buildup and breakthrough. The organization is also able to confronts the reality of the company's current situation as the right decisions would follow subsequently.<br />\\"Good to Great\\" is truly an insightful book and it is very well-researched. His points are well presented as he uses analogies and stories to back them. It is an easy read as his tone is very conversational. There are some jargons but it is not too difficult for the average reader to understand. I like the way he structures the book with \\"key points\\" and \\"unexpected findings\\"at the end of each chapters. I find that helpful and the \\"unexpected findings\\" are quite interesting. For instance, 80% of their 84 interviews did not mention technology as one of the top five factors in their transformation. In addition, Collins considers \\"Good to Great\\" more of a prequel to his other bestseller, \\"Built to Last\\" as many would expect his second book to be a sequel. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the transformation of good to great companies.	2004-03-23

With her best friend Morgan, she found a Vera Wang dress at a huge discount. The catch is that the dress is a size eight and Evie is a size twelve. Determined to wear the dress, Evie soon joined a fitness club, and she has her personal trainer, a gorgeous hunk named Jade. Soon, Evie was working out nearly every day and starving herself. Evie became literally obsessed with losing weight and soon neglected Bruce and everything else that matters.<br />I like &quot;Slim Chance&quot; as it touches an important issue that haunts brides to be and women in general - weight loss. Jackie Rose's story is not an exaggeration as some women do go through what Evie did. In addition, the story flows well and there are definitely funny moments. Evie is not your typical likeable chick-lit heroine. In fact, she's the opposite. She's self-centered, obsessive, selfish and at times neurotic. But you can't help sympathizing with her especially since at the end, she realizes her mistake.	2004-03-08

Both Lucy and Connie do not get along well but each needed the other to get through the tough times together. Soon, Lucy quits her job at the gallery and decided to run Jeremy's run down launderette and she has an idea to transform it. <br />\\"Lucy's Launderette\\" was extremely slow at the beginning. There wasn't a concrete storyline that keeps the readers mesmerized or wanting for more. In fact, the first half of the book was slow, dragging a little, and quite uninteresting. Not to mention, half way through the book, I was wondering when does the \\"launderette\\" part come, because afterall, it is supposed to be about Lucy's Launderette. In addition, this book lacks humor and it can be a bit dull. It does pick up a little at the end. In conclusion, this book is average and I think there are definitely better ones out there.	2004-02-13

Tsianina Lomawaima's &quot;They Called It Prairie Light: The Story of Chilocco Indian School&quot; provides a bleak picture of the Indian boarding school and how it, in a way, was unsuccessful in eliminating tribal identity. Lomawaima, however, agrees that the boarding schools could be very influential, as they had an impact on the use of language, religious conversion, attitudes towards education, and more. Indina children, at such a tender age could easily be culturally transformed. She also discusses the various tactics the students used to adapt to and resist the school's agenda of changing them completely.<br />Lomawaima, uses oral history heavily. It helps too, that her mother was a former student at Chilocco Indian School. I think this is a great book for Native American History students specifically, as she does provide valuable insights into the lives of these students and the use of &quot;education&quot; in the name of &quot;civilizing&quot; them.	2004-02-03

David Wallace Adams, in his groundbreaking book, &quot;Education for Extinction: American Indians and the Boarding School Experience, 1875-1928,&quot; shows how the case for education was made. First, Euro-Americans believed that the older generation of Indians was incapable of becoming civilized and were too attached to their old ways to change. The youthfulness of Indian children meant they could still be saved. <br />Secondly, education quickened the process of cultural evolution from savagism to civilization. Isolating the children, many felt, would help to reduce the influence of their tribes and their traditional cultures. Lastly, education helped prepare the Indians for self-sufficiency.<br />I really enjoy this book as it is extremely well written. Adams, unlike some historians, did not use too many jargons and his writing is easy to understand. Adams also provided background information for readers who are not proficient in this subject matter. In addition, &quot;Education for Extinction&quot; was heavily researched and well-documented.	2004-02-02

Especially, when hot TV star, Matt started paying attention to Sunny.<br />I really enjoy &quot;As Seen On TV.&quot; It is written very well, and is very funny and fast-paced. Mlynowski is definitely one of my favorite chick-lit authors. Her supporting characters are extremely well-developed too. Mlynowski is able to make her characters seem real and readers are able to identify with them. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants  relaxing and funny read.	2004-02-01

Alfie returned to Britain after residing with Rose in Hong Kong for several years. Without Rose, Alfie never seem to fit in and frequently wallowed in self-pity. On top of that, his family was torn apart when Alfie's father left his wife for a younger woman. <br />I read &quot;One for My Baby&quot; after reading &quot;Man and Boy&quot; which I was very impressed. I didn't enjoy &quot;One for My Baby&quot; because I feel that the story seems to drag itself. At times, the main character Alfie seems to be forever wallowing in self-pity and after 50 pages or so, it can get tiring. Regardless of that, the Tony Parsons's writing is still remarkable and he has the ability to make his readers identify with his characters.	2004-01-24

This particular extended family consists of Harry, his son, Pat from his previous marriage and his second wife Cyd and Peggy, from her previous marriage. In \\"Man and Wife\\", Parsons deal with the difficulties of staying together as family as compared to the more traditional families. Harry's relationship with Cyd soon became strained and they started drifting off from each other. In addition, Harry became attracted to Kazumi, a friend of his former wife. On top of that, his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and Harry's life was soon turned upside down.<br />I didn't really enjoy this book as I feel that I cannot relate to Harry. His first marriage failed because of he had a one night stand with his colleague and now he is on the verge of repeating that mistake. However, \\"Man and Wife\\" did provide interesting perspectives from a male point of view and it also touched on an issue that is becoming increasingly common these days - extended families and its complications. This is an okay read for me and I think his first book, \\"Man and Boy\\" is a much better read.	2004-01-07

Gina, unable to deal with Harry's infidelity, left for Japan and soon Harry was \\"stuck\\" with their five-year old son, Pat.<br />Soon, Harry had to learn to take care of Pat, which was hardly an easy task for him. He had to learn to make \\"real\\" food for Pat, deal with Pat's obsession with Star Wars and even washing Pat's hair was a challenge. His learning experience was most vividly described. It was, I felt, very sweet, the way Harry grew to be very fond of Pat (calling him \\"My Beautiful Boy\\" repeatedly) and I also enjoyed the part where he looked up to his dad, a former World War II veteran with pride.<br />There are definitely many funny moments in \\"Man and Boy.\\" Tony Parson managed to put in humor while discussing serious issues such as divorce, death, and parenting. There are times where I sympathize with Harry, but there are also times when I think he deserves his troubles. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand more about raising a child and also understanding the consequences of divorce on a child. \\"Man and Boy\\" is funny, sweet and definitely, entertaining.	2003-12-16
US	50001942	R3OKMQ6Z7H6HSW	0446528382	344910126	Jack: Straight from the Gut	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Very fascinating!	&quot;Jack: Straight from the Gut&quot; written by former General Electric CEO, Jack Welch is an interesting insight into the mind of a CEO. The first quarter of the book deals with his childhood and his college years and I find this part very interesting. He provided information on what motivates him, his education and how he became he is today. The main chunk of the book deals with his early years at GE, starting from the plastic business and later the CEO of the entire corporation. Reading the book, you can the feeling that Welch is extremely ambitious, driven and smart. <br />I enjoy this book because it gives good insights into the life of a CEO, the difficult decisions that he had to make, the importance of people and culture, and the lesson that I learn from him is that, never be afraid to change. Change is inevitable and Welch was not one who is afraid to implement change. He also provided some discussions of some the the decisions that he made and what were the issues that affected businesses. <br />If you are looking for like point to point statergy on how to run a business successful, then this is not what you are looking for. He did provide some advice on that but mostly he provided insights in terms of understanding organizational behaviors and culture. In terms of his personal life, he did not write much about that and I wish that he did. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about decision-making and business in general. It is an easy read, and not much of difficult business jargons.	2003-12-05
US	50001942	R1P4164OQHV2S9	014100018X	598461998	Chocolat	Books	3	1	2	N	N	An okay read.....	In \\"Chocolat,\\" Vianne Rocher, a single mother, arrived in a small French village with her 6 year-old daughter, Anouk and opened a store selling chocolates. Vianne had always been moving constantly, first with her mother, a witch, then with her daughter. Settling down in a place was a new concept for Vianne and she wanted some stability in her life. Unfortunately, the village priest, Father Reynaud saw Vianne as somewhat of a bad influence to the villagers and considered something like chocolates as temptations, which the villagers should avoid. Despite the hostility of the priest, Vianne was determined to settle in that village.<br />This book deals with temptation, love, friendship and also hate. I like the secondary characters of this book as the author is able to describe their characters vividly. I feel that this is an okay read as sometimes, there are things which I feel is a bit hard to believe; such as the threat that Father Reynaud felt of Vianne. In addition, I also wonder about the time period of this book. At times, the setting seems to be in the nineteenth century but references to Disneyland eliminates that possibility. However, it is still an interesting read as the author writes very eloquently and smoothly.	2003-11-26

Desert Exile: The Uprooting of a Japanese-American Family&quot;by Yoshiko Uchida deals with a Japanese-American family who were sent to concentration camp during World War II as Japanese-Americans at that time were considered to be potential &quot;spies&quot; for the Japanese government. Uchida started off with introduction to her family, of how her parents met, and how California became their home. Even though she was raised with Japanese values and ideals, she was at the same time an American who can barely speaks Japanese. Her world was turned upside down when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. <br />Japanese-Americans were sent to concentration camp for fear that they could endanger the national security. This violates their Constitutional rights but there were no public support for their fellow citizens. It was indeed racist of the government as German-Americans were not sent to any concentration camps even though the United States was fighting Germany. The Japanese-Americans had to swallow their pride and dignity and were moved to barracks that were bare and ill-equipped. They were placed behind the fence, guarded by MPs and basically were treated as prisoners. Uchida's vivid descriptions of their living conditions were both horrifying and shocking.<br />&quot;Desert Exile&quot; was used by my professor for a History of American West class. This is truly an eye-opener as most Americans are unaware of their fellow citizens' ordeal and treatment. The Japanese-American loss was immeasurable. Not only did they lose financially (from selling their homes hastily), they lost touch with friends and relatives, lost their pride and lost confidence in their government. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn more about the ordeal of the Japanese-Americans during World War II. It is extremely well-written, eloquent and easy to understand.	2003-11-17
US	50001942	RJ1O114CMNAY	076790592X	725864791	Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, a Young Man, and Life's Greatest Lesson	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Motivational!	&quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; by Mitch Albom, deals with his weekly visits to his old college professor, Morrie, who was dying of the Lou Gehrig's disease. After graduation, Mitch was too busy pursuing his goals to remember about his promise to keep in touch but sixteen years later, after watching an episode of &quot;Nightline,&quot; which did a piece on Morrie, he made a trip to see Morrie one last time before he dies. It was a Tuesday and for the next thirteen Tuesdays, Mitch would be making weekly visits to see his professor. This was going to be Morrie's last class and Mitch is going to be his last and only student and the coursework would be a final thesis (the book). Each time Mitch visited Morrie, his old professor would be teaching him lessons on life - how to love, how to forgive, how to appreciate your loved ones and also his perspective on death. Morrie unlike majority of the people, was not afraid of dying and his mantra was &quot;when you learn how to die, you learn how to live.&quot; <br />His outlook on death was so unusual that Ted Koppel did three shows on Morrie for &quot;Nightline.&quot; Each time Mitch visited Morrie, his condition deteriorated to the point that he could barely moved his toe. And yet, Morrie was not one to wallow in self-pity and was in fact thankful, that he knew of so much of love. One of the most unforgettable moment for me was when Morrie held a memorial service for himself - before he died so that he could appreciate all the good things that people had planned to say of him.  <br />I really enjoy and appreciate this book for all its lessons. Mitch writes in a simple way, to deliver a most unusual message. Contrary to some reviewers who believed that Morrie's message was for the rich, the extremes, I feel that his message was for everyone. That love is the most important thing and make sure that you appreciate those around you before it is too late. One of Morrie's most memorable message for me was that even when a persondies, the relationship between you and him/her doesn't have to. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn.	2003-11-09

Craig Kielburger, a 12 years old Canadian became an activist after reading from the newspaper that Iqbal Masih, also another 12 years old from Pakistan was killed because of his support for the abolition of child labor. Soon, Craig started the \\"Free the Children\\" foundation, consists of only school children and their goal is to bring awareness to the issue of child labor. In order to learn more about this issue, Craig travelled to South Asian countries like Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal and to Thailand, hoping to meet the children himself.<br />His detailed explanation of his trip was quite horrifying. Craig saw that the children were working as much as 10-12 hours a day for a mere US $1-2. Some of the children worked at firework factories where injuries were common and no safety measures were taken. Other times, children were beaten if they do not work. The most disturbing part of the book was his investigations in Bangkok where sex trade was rampant. Children were used as sex tools to lure tourists. The emotional, mental and physical scars that these children bore were immeasurable.<br />\\"Free the Children\\" for me personally, is quite an inspiring book as it shows how one person can make a difference. In addition, it is quite an eye-opener as Craig argues, with examples, why child labor should be abolished and how each and everyone of us can assist in that. I highly recommend this book to anyone as it is extremely educational and motivational. I would caution parents on the part of Bangkok to young children as it can be quite disturbing and graphic.	2003-11-01

She used to date Simon, who was everything she looked for in a guy and whom she felt was the \\"one\\" but unfortunately cheated on her. After her breakup, she had many passionate flings which, did not end well and Tasha ended up feeling hurt and unwanted.  Then there is Adam, Simon's best friend who confided to Tasha that he had always been in love with her. But Tasha, could not see herself falling in love with Adam eventhough she loves Adam. Adam was like a \\"girlfriend\\" to Tasha, the one that she could confide in, and the one who she felt very comfortable with. In addition, there is also Andrew. Andrew was this arrogant and good looking guy whom Tasha had great chemistry with but she knew that a relationship with Andrew would definitely end in a disaster.<br />Personally, I think this is my least favorite among Jane Green's books. There isn't really a strong storyline as everything revolves around Tasha's love life. Unlike her previous books which concentrates on other things such as career or friendships, this one is very unbalanced. In addition, humor is definitely lacking in \\"Straight Talking\\" as there aren't any funny moments or humorous plots. The heroine of this book is extremely unlikeable as she is arrogant, manipulative and ungrateful. It was an okay book... nothing to rave about. There are definitely better chick lits out there. If you have not read any Jane Green's books, this should not be your first as her other books are much better. Green is one of the best chick lit writers out there.... it is just that this was her first book. (It was originally published in 1997)	2003-10-07

As she skipped a few grades in school, she realized that she had a hard time relating to people her age and hence, her she has very little social skills. In addition, Carrie felt that most people are hypocrites and very easily pushed into doing something because of peer pressure even though they realized that it is wrong. She analyzed everything to death and viewed the world as either black or white and there is no middle ground.  Her world slowly changed when her therapist gave her a list of five things to do. Along the way, she met interesting characters and realized that things are not always how they seemed and that it is indeed not a black or grey world.<br />This is not your everyday chick lit book as it is very philosophical and 80% of the book deals with Carrie's inner thoughts and observations. There aren't many conversations and at times, it can be very slow and unappealing. Personally, I didn't really enjoy this book as I feel that it is a bit too depressing for me and I prefer something livelier. However, this is still a well-written book and the author's quirky observations can be sometimes interesting. If you want something different, this is the book for you!	2003-09-27

Pretty&quot; deals with two very different sisters; Francesca (or commonly known as Frank) and Amanda, who inherited their parents' coffee place. Their cafe was competiting against their neighbor Moonburst (sort of like Starbucks) and business was deteriorating badly. In addition, the sisters' relationship with one another was equally bad. Frank, was considered the &quot;smart&quot; one but who had no friends, no social life and she yearned to find a man. Amanda on the other hand, was the popular and &quot;pretty&quot; one. Guys seem to be always interested in her and she had no problems finding friends. Together, they needed to revive their business. <br />Out of the blue came Clarissa, who was willing to help the sisters revived their business as she was doing this for a school project. She suggested holding a contest for Mr. Coffee in order to attract female to the shop. They selected Chick as the winner but soon he turned up dead. This was the starting point of the book for more plots and characters.<br />This book was an okay read... nothing very captivating or memorable. I wish the author would develop the characters more, giving them more personalities. I wouldn't consider this to be entirely a &quot;chick lit&quot; as the second half of the book was more of a mystery read for me. In addition, the love factor in this book is very &quot;choppy&quot; and the author did not really develop the sisters' love interests.	2003-09-15

Sledge was highly recommended by a graduate student in Military History who insisted on this is the best memoir book on World War II available. Eugene B. Sledge or known as Sledgehammer by his fellow Marines provided a detailed account of the battles in Peleliu and Okinawa which was both horrifying and insightful. Sledge started off the book with his boot camp training and how he discontinued his officer training program to participate in the war as an enlisted man.<br />The descriptions that Sledge provided was unbelievably vivid. He described the terrified feeling of being constantly shelled by the enemy while staying in the foxhole, of running in the open space while being shot at and having to live in a dirty, and muddy condition. The part that really got my attention was when he described the dead bodies of men, deteriorating beyond recognition and the stench that filled the air.<br />&quot;With the Old Breed&quot; is written in a simple way to tell a very complicating story. Sledge did not use too many military jargons that might confused the average readers. This book provides a very detailed description of life during war. In addition, the book also revealed the close bonds that were formed among the marines and how they came to value each other. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about a soldier's life during World War II, particularly the pacific theater.	2003-09-04

Da Chen's &quot;Colors of the Mountain&quot; is a memoir dealing with the author's childhood in Yellow Stone, a small rural village in China. As a son of a landlord, Da had a difficult time growing up as his family was considered to counter-revolutionary and was blacklisted by the Communist Party. He was constantly targeted and abused by other kids and even teachers seemed to loathe him. This was set during the Cultural Revolution period where education was deemed dangerous and intellectuals were sent to the rural area to be re-educated. <br />Despite these obstacles, Da persevered to stay in school. As he was isolated from kids of his age at school, he befriended with a few older guys who were not in school, smoke and gamble. Even though these guys were deemed &quot;dangerous&quot; by the village people, they were sincere and accepted Da as who he was rather than what family he came from. However, Da's fortune changed when Chariman Mao passed away and suddenly, college education was what everyone talked about. Da knew that his only chance at getting out of the small village and sought a better life for himself was to get accepted into a college. <br />I enjoy this book as Da Chen wrote beautifully and at times, almost poetically. His descriptions of the sceneries at his village, the Dong Jing River, the mountains were vivid. The book also describes the lives of landlord families during Cultural Revolution and how it affected the landlords' children. Quite a number of books written on Cultural Revolution usually dealt with intellectuals or people with ties to the West and how they were jailed and torture. &quot;Colors of the Mountain&quot; on the other hand, saw Cultural Revolution through the eyes of a child. I highly recommend this book.	2003-07-26

In each of the chapter, the author would provide recipes either from restaurants or from friends and relatives. I was quite disappointed with the book as besides the recipes, the author's writing seems disjointed. In addition, if the reader is not from New York City, then he/she wouldn't know what restaurant that the author recommended. This plays a huge part in the book, which makes it hard to ignore. On top of that, I wish she had included more of her personal life or her relationship with her boyfriend. That being said, she did provides very interesting recipes. But note that, this is not definitely not considered a chick lit. There is way too little storyline for that.	2003-07-15

This is my first Marian Keyes's books and I understand now why she has so many fans. &quot;Sushi For Beginners&quot; deals with the world of magazines in Ireland. Lisa, a powerful editor for a magazine in London was transferred to Ireland to start a new magazine targeted at women called &quot;Colleen.&quot; Lisa was terribly unhappy at this transfer as Ireland was dull and dreary compared to London and she considered it an insult. At the same time, she was recently divorced from her husband of four years. Lisa is one of those difficult boss/supervisor as she is extremely competitive, arrogant and expected nothing but the best. Her assistant editor, Ashling was the complete opposite. <br />Ashling is a big worrier and with somewhat low self-esteem. However, she is extremely kind, sensitive and caring. She found out that working for Lisa was extremely difficult as Lisa seemed to take it upon herself to make Ashling's life miserable. Then there is Jack, the managing editor at Colleen who also seemed to bully Ashling and Lisa had her eyes set on him. Other characters in the book include Clodagh, Ashling's best friend who is an unhappy housewife and mom, and who seemed to blame her husband for everything; Ted, Ashling's stand up comedian friend; and Marcus, another stand up comedian who seemed to be interested in Ashling.<br />There are definitely a lot of characters and plots in this book which at times can be a little confusing but once you get the hang of it, you will enjoy the book. The storyline is nothing new - the whole arrogant editor and victimized assistant but Marian Keyes adds subplots which makes the entire book quite a treat. In addition, there are definitely humor and romance in &quot;Sushi For Beginners&quot;. This is a great summer read!	2003-06-20

Jane Green is definitely one of my favorite chick-lit authors. &quot;Babyville&quot; is different from her previous works (Mr. Maybe, Bookends) which concentrate on single girl finding love, etc. &quot;Babyville&quot; deals with different women and the themes that tie all three of them are relationships and babies. The first woman, Julia was a succesful television producer who had a steady relationship with Mark, who was an attorney. Their relationship had been going downhill and Julia felt that a baby would heal and &quot;repair&quot; their relationship. Unfortunately, Julia was unable to get pregnant and resentment towards Mark grew as she blamed him for that. <br />The next woman, Maeve was a career oriented television producer who was recently offered a great job. Maeve did not believe that she needed a man to make her life complete and commitment was the last thing on her mind. Unfortunately for Maeve, she became pregnant after a one night stand with a stranger. She had to decide whether to keep the baby or to get an abortion as a baby would be an obstacle to her career. The last woman, Sam, recently gave birth to a baby boy and the author showed the difficulties of the first year of having a baby. Sam's relationship with her husband suffered when she resented him for leaving the house for work when Sam was stuck at home, doing chores and taking care of a screaming baby. Chris, on the other hand had to deal with a difficult wife and anything he said might cause a huge argument. <br />I really enjoy &quot;Babyville&quot; because it deals with real issues that women can relate to. In addition, Jane Green also did a great job in developing her characters making them seem &quot;real&quot; and likeable. She has a way of making you feel that you know the characters personally. The themes are definitely - relationship, love and career, and how you balance one with the other. I highly recommend this book because it is different from other typical chick-lit as this oneis more serious, better written and is definitely a keeper.	2003-06-18

Her life, she deemed would be complete. Working, according to Clarissa was a concept for the poor. She was popular among the the rich and who slept with, she claimed, two thirds of the men in L.A. Clarissa unlike other chick lit heroines is selfish, arrogant, scornful and is definitely materialistic. Her dream was realized when a new man in town, Aaron, who was rich, important and definitely had the potential to be Clarissa's husband. Before Clarrisa even met Aaron, she was already planning their wedding, ordering flowers, and trying out wedding dress. Soon, she and Aaron were married and Clarissa thought she would have everything that she dreamed for. Unfortunately for Clarissa, things were not the way they seemed.  <br />It took me a while to get into the book as Clarissa at the beginning of the book is very unlikeable. However, her character gets more bearable and I even like her at the end of the book. \\"Maneater\\" is definitely a satirical look at the rich socialites in Los Angeles/Beverly Hills region. You can get an inside look at how the rich and famous socialize and the author at times pokes fun at them. The book is well-written and it definitely has its funny moments. \\"Maneater\\" is quite refreshing change and I highly recommend it. It is not my favorite book ever but it is still a good summer read.	2003-06-14

In &quot;Fashionistas&quot;, Vig worked as an associate editor for &quot;Fashionistas,&quot; a fashion magazine that relied on celebrities and glossy pictures for success. Her immediate supervisor/boss, Jane was an arrogant, snobbish, and who treated everyone around her with no respect whatsoever. Soon, Jane was &quot;recruited&quot; by a few other co-workers who had a plan to overthrow Jane from her &quot;throne.&quot; Vig's role in this plan would include getting favor from Alex Keller, the events editor. <br />&quot;Fashionistas&quot; unlike other Red Dress Ink books did not shine because it deals solely with Vig's job as an associate editor. There were hardly any focus on friendships and absolutely none on family. Even though it is nice of the author to pay attention on career but I think it makes the book a bit lopsided as other incredients such as family, friendship and love, also play an equally important role. I agreed with other reviewers who felt that the love side of &quot;Fashionistas&quot; barely exists. This makes the book seems boring at times. In addition, I don't feel that I really know the characters at all, including Vig herself. The writing seems kind of &quot;choppy&quot; and it doesn't flow well. In fact, there are a lot of abrupt endings to each chapters. That being said, the author is extremely knowledgeable about the ins and outs of working for a magazine. I would have given &quot;Fashionistas&quot; a three and half stars if it is possible because the book is really not that bad but I am still a little disappointed. There are definitely better chick lit books out there.	2003-06-13

Faith always considered her relationship with Peter to be wonderful until she suspected him to be having an affair. Peter later confessed that he did indeed have an affair and Faith's was incredibly devastated. She was still very much in love with Peter but unsure of how to deal with his fling and suddenly another man, Jos, was paying attention to her. Jos was charming, attentive, good-looking and Faith became torn. <br />Even though this is a Red Dress Ink book, it is not your typical chick-lit as this book deals with a much more serious topic - infidelity. Wolff tries successfully to add humor to such a grave situation. In addition, her main character is married and in her thirties unlike other chick-lit authors whose main characters are usually single and in their twenties. Her characters are well-developed, making you feel that you really know them. My only complain is that the book is quite slow and there seems to be no surprises. Once you get the storyline, that's it. So, it can be a little boring at times. However, I still think it is a good book especially since it was written well.	2003-06-10

I have never read the two previous books on Katie Nash and I must say &quot;True to Form&quot; is definitely a keeper. Katie, now a thirteen year old teenager lived with her strict and serious dad and her stepmother. &quot;True to Form&quot; deals with Katie's daily lives, friends, relationships and how all these elements contributed to her becoming an adult. Katie was very expressive, and it was interesting to learn about her thoughts and ideas. She was not very happy when her dad volunteered her for a babysitting job of three young boys and also taking care of an elderly woman who lived nearby. In addition, Katie also missed her friend in Texas where she lived for some time before moving to Missouri.  <br />I really enjoy this book because it reminds me a great deal of the times when I was growing up. The things that I enjoyed, the things that made me mad.&quot;True to Form&quot; is beautifully written, eloquent and very mesmerizing. Berg, has this talent of making her readers feel like they really know the characters intimately. I am now eager to read her previous books on Katie. I highly recommend this book as it is very easy to read and not too long. It took me a day and a half to finish it.	2003-06-04

In &quot;Slave to Fashion,&quot; Katie Castle worked as the production manager for Penny Moss, a succesful businesswoman and designer. She was also engaged to Penny's son, Ludo, whom she took for granted. Knowing that she was going to be tied down forever to one man, Katie yearned for a one-night stand. Soon, she was in bed with Liam, Penny's van driver. After her affair was out, Katie lost everything. <br />It is very difficult to get into this book. After about 100 pages, the book improves a little. First of all, Katie is an extremely unlikeable character. She is arrogant, materialistic, taking advantage of people and sneer at others constantly. (Calling people &quot;lepers&quot; and at laughing at their clothes) It is difficult to be sympathetic to her and her plight. Secondly, the beginning of the book is quite confusing. There are too many characters and soon I begin to lose track of who is who. Lastly, I also agree with one reviewer who had difficulties with the fashion lingo. There are definitely better chick lits out there.	2003-06-03
US	50001942	R3JX7CL7QLPJMX	0373250177	776542418	On The Verge (Red Dress Ink (Numbered Paperback))	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Careers and Friends	&quot;On The Verge&quot; deals with Eve Vitali who worked as an assistant/secretary/receptionist for &quot;Bicycle Boy&quot; a magazine that is devoted to bicycles in New York City. Eve had just graduated with a degree in journalism from college and this was her first &quot;real&quot; job. She had just gotten an apartment with her college friend Roseanne and was hoping to write and basically be successful. Unfortunately, her job was unsatisfying and Eve basically spent most of her time surfing the Net or playing hangman. Besides Roseanne, Eve also relied on Tabitha, a classy but arrogant friend who also worked for the publishing company but with another magazine. The book basically chronicled their daily lives; hitting the bars, flirting, going on dates and at the same time, trying to find fulfilment in their jobs. <br />I enjoy &quot;On The Verge&quot; because it is a little different from other chick-lits. This book deals a lot more with finding success after graduating from school and basically, trying to fit in. It is not hard to identify with the characters especially if you are a recent graduate. I think &quot;On The Verge&quot; is quite balanced, in the sense that it did not neglect careers when focusing on finding love, unlike many chick-lits authors. This is not the best I have read, but it is definitely better than average. I'm definitely enjoying the Red Ink Dress books.	2003-05-31

They all hoped to be successful and each had a different vision of what &quot;success&quot; is. The book chronicled their lives from early twenties to when they were in their sixties. Leigh, was the rational, career-minded one who strived to be a casting agent while Cady was the romantic, spendrift and at times naive schoolteacher. Vanessa worked as a flight attendant and found the occupation suitable for her needs for adventure and meeting new people. Susan, was the odd one in their group in the sense that she was quiet, eccentric and never quite fit in with the rest. Soon, one event happened that changed their lives forever and the decisions that they would make in future would be based upon that particular event. <br />The theme of the book is friendship and how they were there for each other through highs and lows. The characters may not  understood the decisions some of the decisions that were made but regardless, they were always there for each other. I really enjoy this book because it was written very well, very thoughtful and just mesmerizing. Rona Jaffe also tried to chronicle the lives and mentalities of women in each of the decades starting from the sixties. At the end of the book, you would feel that you really know each of the characters and feel for them. This is not a chick lit book but definitely one written for the female audience. I highly recommend this book.	2003-05-28

Jane had been single for sometimes and desperately needed a date to attend her cousin's wedding. Her best friends, Amanda and Eloise set her up for blind dates with various guy so that Jane would have a date for the wedding. At the same time, she had been working for Posh for six years and had no proper recognition for her hard work and Jane was striving for a promotion. She was also assigned to work with Natasha, a small time actress, on a memoir she was writing. Jane and Natasha used to go to high school together and Jane resented the fact that Natasha was the popular girl in school who also stole the guy she had a crush on. In short, Jane felt like a loser for not able to get a boyfriend and that everyone else seemed to have things going for them. <br />\\"See Jane Date\\" was very well written. It contained elements such as love, friendship and work that made this book appealing to single women. Friendship is a big theme in this book where Jane could always count on Eloise and Amanda for support no matter what. It is also quite amusing to see Jane going on blind dates in a desperate attempt to find someone to care for her especially since she lost her parents at a young age. This book has its funny moments and it's not the laugh out loud kind. \\"See Jane Date\\" is different from other chick lit books in the sense that Jane came to a realization that she was indeed blessed to have friends who cared for her a great deal, a career, and independence.	2003-05-23

Melonie. Josie's self-esteem plummeted and started losing faith in love and men. Josie's cousin was getting married in New York and as the bridesmaid, Josie was flying to New York from London to attend the ceremony. During the flight, Josie sat next to Matt, a rock journalist who seemed interesting and promising. At the same time, Damien realized that Melonie was unbearable and that he actually missed Josie. Damien then planned to fly to New York to win Josie back. <br />The entire book centers around Martha's preparation for her wedding. This book resembles quite a few of the romantic comedies out there where the two main characters always misses each other - for instance, just as Josie left the restaurant, Matt would arrived there. The plot is actually not very believable as both Josie and Matt seemed to &quot;fall in love&quot; despite only spending half a day with each other. This is the second book of Kelly Ripa's Book Club that I am reading and I must say it is much better than Carly Phillip's &quot;The Bachelor.&quot; I would have given this a three and a half stars but since it is impossible, I am more incline to give it a four instead of three. The reason being, despite the predictable plot, Carole Matthews actually held my attention and the book was written well.	2003-05-22

The problem here was the Becky's mother was planning a backyard wedding in her home in England while Luke's rich and arrogant mother planned to hold the wedding at The Plaza, a prestigious and glamorous hotel in New York. Becky was torn between making her mother happy and having the fantasy-like wedding (with Sleeping Beauty as the theme) in The Plaza. Like the first and second books of this series, Becky got into deep trouble with her lies, when both parties planned her wedding simultaneously. On top of all this, Luke had no idea all this were happening as he was too busy helping his mother with her organization. <br />Readers who have not read the previous two books might have trouble understanding and sympathizing with Becky as she can be perceived as annoying or irritating. However, for others, Becky was just being her usual self. I really enjoy &quot;Shopaholic Ties the Knot&quot; as it is funny, witty, well-written and quite frequently, I find myself laugh out loud at some of Becky's antics. I also like the way Kinsella ends the book in stylee unlike some authors who have tendencies to rush a little towards the end. I highly recommend this book as it is very uplifting, humorous and definitely a must-read book for chick lit fans.	2003-05-20

Hatto & Hatto's authors never made it to the bestselling list, and this made Grace's job of securing decent publicity for the authors even more difficult. This was vivid in Grace's latest client, Henry Moon. From one blunder to another, Grace was convinced that her career, before it even began will end soon. An opportunity came when Grace was assigned to work with Red Campion, one of the hottest movie stars around. At the same time, Belinda Black, an unethical journalist was dying to get her hands on Campion for an interview which she was sure would make her the most sought after journalist in London. <br />This is the fourth book of Holden that I have read. Holden has a unique of style of writing and her books are usually relatively fast-paced. \\"Gossip Hound\\" unlike \\"Bad Heir Day\\" is witty and funny. My only problem with this book is that, like Holden's other books, it is quite predictable. There is always one character like Belinda Black, who is arrogant, beautiful, unethical and annoying that appears consistently in all her books. In addition, each of her heroines is usually a pushover, meek and has an egoistic boyfriend. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy her books and her plots (with the exception of \\"Bad Heir Day\\") are fun and interesting. \\"Gossip Hound\\" is definitely different from other chick lits and I definitely enjoy the glimpses into the competitive literary world.	2003-05-15

John was everything Harriet looked for in a boyfriend; dashing, intelligent and just plain charming. However, she was very cautious in order to prevent herself from getting hurt. Added to Harriet's confusion was the constant squabbles between her roommates - Jacko and Sally. Jacko was constantly picking women and Sally was a single mother. In addition, Rosie, Harriet's friend was a major gossiper and had been updating Harriet on the things going on between John and Nina.<br />This book is quite lengthy. This book, unlike others, actually concentrates on the secondary characters (in this case, Jacko and Sally) which makes it more appealing. The storyline simple but the way Elizabeth Young tells it, makes it special. The themes of this book are love and friendship. The love story between Harriet and John was carefully build and developed which makes the ending even more exciting. This book is fun to read, nothing special, and quite typical.	2003-05-12

During the course of his journey, he encountered obstacles and successfully overcame each one of them. He soon discovered more about himself, and others around him. This motivational book encourages each and every one of us to pursue our dreams. Instead of standing by the sidelines, we should take action to achieve and discover our dreams. Others who stand by the sidelines will always be dreaming where else others who take action will be closer to achieving them. Paulo Coelho carefully combined the elements of dreams and magic to send this message to his readers and that is, we are in control of our actions and we are the only ones who can help ourselves discover our destinies. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about him/herself and life in general.	2003-05-12

Humiliated, Ginger did not know why Greg didn't show up at their wedding and resolve to continue her life. Unfortunately, she had to give up her apartment as it belonged to her aunt who needed it back. Ginger also had complicated relationship with her eccentric mother and moving in with her was out of the question. On top of that, her boss is murdered and she lost her job as the company closed. In short, Ginger was having tons of misfortunes. To make her life more complicated, she kept bumping into Nick, the detective working on the murder case of her boss and whom she lost her virginity too years ago. Ginger was unsure of her feelings for Nick especially since Greg turned up eventually and became apologetic and wanted to get back together with her. <br />\\"Loose Screws\\" is well-written as compared to some of the chick lits out there. Karen Templeton adds insightful observations of life. She is especially skillful in dealing with the complexity of a mother-daughter relationship; each not understanding and knowing what the other wants. In fact, the theme of the book deals with Ginger who struggled with identity crisis, growing up not wanting to be \\"like her mother\\" but found out that she was more similiar to her mother than she realized. This is not a particularly humorous book but it does have its funny moments.	2003-05-11

Sam, with the help of Jackie managed to get over her break up, and started hanging out in the bars too.  <br />This is the second book of Sarah Mlynowski that I read. I really like her style of writing. \\"Milkrun\\" is extremely funny, quirky and very well written. Mlynowski concentrates greatly on friendship, especially during times of need such as break ups, etc. The author understood the plight of the twenty-somethings and I think this is one of the better women literature out there. In addition, this book is well-balanced with a dose of everything; work, romance, and friendship. I highly recommend this book and Mlynowski's second book, \\"Fishbowl.\\"	2003-05-05

The secret to loving according to Lucado is living loved. His style of writing is very conversational, and easy to understand. Lucado provides real life examples together with biblical stories to illustrate his points. Most readers would find this book beneficial in understanding love and relationship. I especially like the end when he gently reminds his readers that at the end of the day, relationships matter more than anything in the world, including a college diploma or a nice car.  <br />I highly recommend this book as his explanation of love is done very well and this would make a great gift to families and friends. At the end of the book, discussion questions of each chapters are included to increase understanding on the materials covered. The book's strongest points are the Lucado's friendly writing and his message of love and forgiveness.	2003-05-04

Ginger, a second generation Korean American, is a fashion assistant working for Sam, her friend from college, and her struggles to get better and more meaningful assignments beyond answering phone calls. Afterall, she has a Master degree in English. Problems emerged when her mother, who was very old-fashioned came to visit her in New York City and started to arrange dates for her daughter. Ginger, according to her mother was near &quot;full bloom&quot; - meaning getting older and not settling down with a family. Even though Ginger was not thrill with the idea of her mother hanging around, but she soon learned a lot from her, and took her advise in life and career. <br />Another problem that Ginger was facing was her identity. She was sort of torn between her Korean heritage and her upbringing as an American. She couldn't see that the two were inseparable and Koreans to Ginger, were traditional, old-fashioned and too typical (set) for her. Ginger was also set to show the world that she was not the &quot;typical&quot; Asian woman. She was not submissive, not quiet and certainly not willing to settle for anything less than a meaningful career. Her mother on the other hand, did not understand that and felt that a husband would complete Ginger's life.<br />I really like this book. It gives glimpses into the lives of Korean-Americans, their beliefs and values. In addition, the relationship between Ginger and her mother was written well and their love for each other was not the &quot;in-your-face&quot; type but substle. At the same time, both mother and daughter were dealing with the &quot;loss&quot; of Ginger's brother, George. George was disowned by his mother when he decided to married a white woman. There were certainly a lot of issues and &quot;In The Bloom&quot; will sort of get you thinking. I highly recommend this book because it is funny, sad, and definitely entertaining.	2003-05-02

Despite that, Ruby cannot seemed to be able to open to Michael or her friends due to the past and at the same time. At the same time, Michael also had a past that might affect their relationship forever. <br />This book was just average for me. I didn't like her writing style, I find it confusing. The characters were unlikeable for me and the love story between Ruby and Michael never did go anywhere. In addition, the book can be somewhat depressing and to a certain extent boring. That being said, the book does have a positive points such as you get to know the character Ruby really well and I think many people can relate to her plight. It is really not a bad book but it just didn't appeal to me. There are definitely better books in this genre.	2003-04-30

She moved in to this family to become a nanny for a difficult child called Zak and was hoping to learn something from the Zak's mother, Cassandra, a successful novel writer. Unfortunately, things did not turn out so well for her as she was totally exploited by Cassandra and terrorized by Zak. Cassandra was arrogant, pretentious and abusive. Cassandra on the other hand was having difficulties writing her next novel and her marriage to a former rocker was suffering. Her one change of leaving Cassandra for good was accepting a marriage proposal from Jamie a guy she met at a wedding who owns a castle.<br />I have read Wendy Holden's \\"Simply Divine\\" and \\"Farm Fatale\\" and I must say that this is Holden's worst book. The main character, Anna was unlikeable, a doormat with low self-esteem and who is willing to put up with any rubbish from people. In addition, the characters reminded me of the ones in \\"Farm Fatale\\" in the sense that Wolden placed too much emphasis on the secondary characters such as Cassandra and half way through the book, I am wondering who is the main focus here. The plot is quite similar to \\"Farm Fatate\\", a doormat, with an overbearing boyfriend and then quite suddenly meeting another man from out of nowhere and who became her rescuer. \\"Bad Heir Day\\" consists of no humor, very dry and unlikeable characters. There is hardly any good romance in the book and if there is, not quite believable. It's quite disappointing considering how well \\"Simply Divine\\" was written.	2003-04-26

Sophy's family was very much part of the storyline as they were integral in bringing Sophy and Josh together. It is very much a &quot;family drama&quot; type book. The storyline is no doubt predictable and not exactly original but it is still very fun to read as the plots are well-written and quite funny. Some readers might not like Sophy as she can be quite neurotic especially around Josh. This is also not one of those books that you start reading and immediately drawn to the plot and characters. But as you continue, you will get more absorbed in the plot.	2003-04-24

Before long, Sophy realized that she was in a mess as she had to tell more lies to cover up her original lie.<br />The secondary characters in this book were very well-developed. Sophy's family was very much part of the storyline as they were integral in bringing Sophy and Josh together. It is very much a &quot;family drama&quot; type book. The storyline is no doubt predictable and not exactly original but it is still very fun to read as the plots are well-written and quite funny. Some readers might not like Sophy as she can be quite neurotic especially around Josh. This is also not one of those books that when you start reading you will be immediately drawn to the plot and characters. Instead, as you read more, you will get more interested in Sophy's life and how everything turns out.	2003-04-24

It is quite realistic in the sense that the author touches on issues for women such as the fear of losing a job, and all the preparation for a wedding. Amy did not get the enthusiasm from her family or co-workers and was basically the person organizing everything from booking a caterer to buying a pair of wedding shoes. Basically, she was getting neurotic about things such as her new last name and sharing everything with another human being. <br />It quite fascinating book because you get a glimpse into the life of a bride-to-be. You tend to sympathize and understand her plight and her wish to have everything done right. Laura Wolf shows the horror and joy of planning for one's wedding. I highly recommend this book because it is humorous, well-written and very entertaining. Women especially can identify with this book. The anticipation of getting married, the stress that comes with it, and the doubts that never seem to disappear. However, the final result of all the stress and hardwork pays off.	2003-04-22

Some people perceive that this is only for business managers but after reading it, I understand that \\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\" is useful to just about everyone. If you are undergoing change in your life, then this is the book for you. It can be change in your personal life, career or relationships. The advice from this book is that you must understand that change is inevitable, it will come no matter what and the best thing you can do is to anticipate change so that we can adapt to it quickly. <br />This book is short, concise and very easy to read. The author did not use jargons and I think this is good as all readers will be able to understand and benefit from the book. Most people can easily relate to some of the situations that were described. I recommend this book because I think it is helpful for people to understand more about change and how they can deal with it. Change is not necessary a bad thing. It is just a matter of how you approach it.	2003-04-16

At the same time, she was also attracted to Tom, the guy living a floor above hers and had a one-night stand with him. Even though Jane was very attracted to Tom, she felt guilty about their fling especially since she thought that Nick and her still had a chance. Just as she convinced herself that, Nick dumped her for another woman and had been cheating on her. However, this is not the main storyline.<br />Jane's work took a bad turn when her editor asked her to write for this in demand celebrity named Champagne. Champagne was paid generously to &quot;write&quot; a column but in reality Jane had to check in with Champagne frequently to write the column for her. This was basically the main theme. Particularly, her contacts with Champagne and her best friend's mansion (called Mullions) which was in ruins and Jane had to help her friend finds a rich man who could restored the mansion. <br />I have only two problems with the book. Firstly, the fact that Wolden makes Jane &quot;in love&quot; with Tom when she only had a one night stand was to me, a little far-fetched. There was a lack of development in Jane's love life except that she keeps holding out for Tom even after he had left for New York. My second problem is the secondary character, Tally, Jane's best friend. She was very unlikeable and her character I felt was not fully developed. Other than that, the book is relatively entertaining. I also enjoyed Wolden's style of writing which is very smooth and flows nicely. However, bear in mind that this is a comedy not a romantic comedy.	2003-04-15

Her boyfriend, Mark, an aspiring columnist was reluctant to move until his paper offered him a column to write about life in the country. There, the couple met fascinating characters. They managed on both of their small incomes to get a cottage and met up with interesting neighbors which include hippies, farm owners, and etc. Rosie was adjusting well but Mark grew more resentful as his few attempts to submit his column was rejected. At the same time, Samantha, an arrogant, supposedly know-it-all aspiring actress was also moving to the country because it was trendy to do so and she hoped to conquer the local social scene. Meanwhile, Rosie gradually realized that Mark was getting unbearable. Her love life was getting more complicated with the encounter of Jack, a farm boy who was down to earth and later a brief encounter with Matt Locke, the recluse rock star.<br />I think this book is funny, light and very entertaining. My only complain is that the author tried to emphasize both Rosie and Samantha as the main characters but gradually it becomes apparent that Rosie is really the main focus. The Samantha storyline just sort of drift off. This is not the typical chick lit book with predictable outcome but in fact is very different. I find it quite exciting especially with the second half of the book and the author leaves you wanting for more. I think the author did a great job in developing the book's secondary characters and giving them diverse personalities which makes the book more fascinating.	2003-04-10

It was unreal for her and at the same time, her mother was also have difficulties accepting her husband death. It became Helen's responsibility to make sure that things are fine for her mother who suffered mild depression. At the same time, her love life was basically not going anywhere, dating briefly ... Jasper and Marcus. The only bright spot in Helen's life was the meeting of Tom, a vet who drove Helen to her father's funeral when she had an auto accident with Tom's assistant. <br />This is not a particularly \\"fun\\" book because the pace is quite slow. Even though I sympathize with the main character Helen, she is not particularly likeable in the sense that she makes the same mistakes again and again, and she is quite passive. I have mixed feelings about this book. It would be more entertaining if the author develops the secondary characters more. Also, her editor needs to make an extra effort in proofreading because there were quite a few errors in the book especially typos. I recommend this book if you are not looking for light or fun read but something different from the typical chick lits.	2003-04-08

The first half of the book provides information on his grandfather and father's Navy careers. This might be mundane to some readers but as I read along, I understand how his family's legacy made John McCain who he is. McCain also detailed his life in the Navy academy and outlining the academic and practical training he received. It is quite interesting to learn more about McCain's childhood, living from one state to another, never really retaining close friends and his rebellious years at the Academy.<br />The second half of the book deals with his imprisonment in Vietnam. This part of the book is most amazing and eye-opening. The beatings and tortures that McCain and other POWs received were appalling. It takes a lot for these prisoners to endure both physically and mentally. McCain describes the various methods that the prisoners used to occupy their time, to keep the mind as clear as possible and to provide support for their fellow prisoners. Communication proved to be an essential part of their survival. In addition, McCain was generous in his compliments to his fellow prisoners and provided many true stories of heroism and bravery of the POWs.<br />After finishing this book, I cannot but feel tremendous respect for John McCain and other POWs who survived the terrible ordeals and also to the military. In this memoir, McCain proved that it is important for the POWs to believe in both the military and the government to take care of their families when they were unable to. This memoir/biography is definitely worth reading and readers can gain valuable insights into life in general and things that we take for granted, such as freedom. \\"Faith of My Fathers\\" is a reminder for us to appreciate the little things in life and most importantly, to have faith.	2003-04-04

Laura Caldwell's &quot;Burning the Map&quot; deals with Casey who was on vacation in Rome and later Greece with her close friends from college, Kat and Sin. The vacation was very much needed for Casey as she was dealing with problems and issues in her life and the trips provided some sort of an esacpe. Casey used to be closer to Kat and Sin but ever since she met John and was also enrolled in law school, she neglected them. Casey was hoping this vacation can help mend things with them. At the same time, her parents were having marital problems and Casey was finding a difficult time dealing with it. Worse still was her problems with John who became too obsessed with his work and their relationship was getting too mundane.<br />In Rome, Casey met an Italian guy who sent her heart racing and the brief encounter made Casey realized that it had been a long time since she was excited to see a guy and her relationship with John was just too plain. At the same time, she realized that it would not be quite easy to mend things with Kat and Sin and Casey felt left out in their conversations. However, as they gradually open up, Casey found out that she was not the only one with problems but Kat and Sin had issues in their life too. In the mean time, as her vacation was coming to an end, Casey dread the thought of working 10 hours with a law firm and also facing John.<br />I really like and enjoy this book very much. I think most readers can relate to what Caldwell's character, Casey was experiencing. Caldwell also did an excellent job developing the characters and making her readers feel like they really know Casey. The book is very well-written and exciting at the same time, especially with the part on vacation. In addition, this book also contains a bit of everything such as friendship, love, career, and family. This book is highly recommended and it is one of the best in its genre.	2003-03-27

Her chance came where she was approached by a former staff of one of the biggest cosmetic company who told Rebecca about an anti-wrinkle cream which contains illegal chemicals which would cause its users to \\"tell the truth.\\" At the same time, Rebecca is dating Max, who works with Rebecca for the same magazine. Also in the picture are Rebecca's best friend, Jess who was having problems with her husband's lack of sexual interest, and Lipstick, who was her high school friend and now going to be her stepmother. <br />The plot is very predictable and you can sort of guess what is going to happen very early in the book. It is one of those books that is not very memorable and the characters could be develop more. However, it is still somewhat entertaining, especially dealing with Rebecca's friends, Jess and Lipstick. This two characters provide some humorous scenes. I wouldn't specifically recommend this book especially since there are so many other better ones out there. If you are a big Sue Margolis fan, this is still somewhat entertaining but just don't expect too much.	2003-03-24

Maddie was shocked to hear of the news and even more shocked the meet Hank Madison, the grandson and heir to the fortune that she inherited. Hank, was a city guy, no time to relax, busy at work and very ambitious. Hank assumed that Maddie was one of those women who conned his grandfather. What was more shocking was the rest of the will which said that Hank could inherit the holdings and companies if Hank agreed to stay in the small town under Maddie's supervision for six weeks, and not suppose to work at all. It was in other words, a set up by his grandfather. This was how Maddie and Hank grew to like each other and eventually fall in love.<br />This is a slower paced &quot;chick lit,&quot; and if you are looking for a fast paced, and lots of action, this is not the book for you. However, slower pace is not necessarily a bad thing as the characters were well developed and you get to know them better. Another thing I like about this book is that, the relationship between Maddie and Hank was slowly developed and was not rushed like other books and I think that is great. Also, the secondary characters in this books are fun and very charismatic. Lastly, the writing is clear and concise and I think this is not your usual romance book and it is quite refreshing.	2003-03-13

To mend her broke heart, Liv left the United States for Australia where her best friend was currently on holidays. She had a good time there, meeting strangers who later became her friends, the beach and a chance to meet up with Ben. When Liv was 18 and on holidays in France, she met Ben and they had a brief summer romance. Liv, had a second chance to see if Ben was the right one for her. That was not the only thing that was about to change in Liv's life but also her career; from accounting to fashion designing. <br />&quot;Dog Handling&quot; is midly entertaining, but unfortunately not very memorable. It is one of those books that you read but a few weeks later don't really remember what the plot was. It is also rather predictable and the secondary characters are just so-so. At times, some of the characters/plots seem a bit unbelievable - such as how can a foreigner just stayed in Australia as long as she likes and somewhat magically start a business. Just the nitty-gritty details like that were omitted. However, it is still rather interesting to read how she went on a rebound and met strange but rather interesting characters and how it all ended.	2003-03-05

All three came from very different family background and hence, very different personalities. In spite of their differences, they bonded and became friends. However, the test to their friendships came when a fire broke out in their apartment. Since the apartment was not insured, they had to come out with money to repair their kitchen and to replace the appliances. They came up with all sorts of schemes, such as Halloween party and seminar on how to pick up women. <br />Even though the theme of this book is friendship, the book does deal with relationships with the opposite sex. However, \\"Fishbowl\\" unlike other chick lits, does not focus on it solely and it is actually quite refreshing and different. The characters are not the typical heroines in chick lits but actually women with tons of flaws. The only complain I have this book is that the author makes it seems like smoking pot is normal and common which I think is not true. <br />I highly recommend this book as I think it is fun, humorous and very quirky. It deals with everyday issues such as getting along with your roommates, finding yourself after graduation, feeling lost and lastly, friendships. \\"Fishbowl\\" shows that even in a confined situation with people who are very different from you, it is still up to you to make the best out of it.	2003-03-04

It was one of those monotonous job where your boss can't even remember your name. The firm had also interesting characters. It was in the same building that Lonnie met up with an old college friend, Dominic. Sparks flew but Lonnie was fighting to control her desire for him as she was semi-attached to Terry, a struggling comedian. At the same time, Lonnie was also dealing with her mother who felt that Lonnie should lose some weight, her sister moving in and accidentally discover the dead body of one of the partners in her law firm. She was also working with a local cop to snoop around the office and to observe her colleagues as the cops believed that the partner was murdered.<br />I really like this book because it doesn't just deal with romance which I find is too boring and predictable. Jill Winters did a good job in interwining the romance between Lonnie and Dominic with the murder mystery. Another thing that is good about this book is that it is not slow-paced unlike other books and the characters are very likeable. There are also funny moments in the book especially with Lonnie's mother and her relationship with Dominic. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a relaxing yet enjoyable book.	2003-02-17

As they knew each other from college, their relationship was a very close and trusting one. Their life-long friends, Josh (whom they knew from college) and his wife Lucy, were very much involved in their lives. This book seems like a combination of the TV shows, \\"Friends\\" and \\"Will and Grace.\\" Cath's dream of opening a bookstore was a reality when Lucy suggested that they should open one together. From there, Cath was introduced to a cute real estate agent, James. On top of that, Cath and Si were suspecting that Josh was cheating on his wife, and that created hostility among them. The test to all their friendships came when Si (who was gay) was HIV positive. <br />One of the best things about this book is that it sort of educate its readers on the subject of AIDS and how it will affect the people around you and how there are ways in which a person can deal with the reality of having the virus and also for his/her family. Jane Green does it in a very subtle way so that it won't overwhelmed her readers. In addition, I like the storyline of the book, very simple yet interesting and the theme of this book is friendship. By friendship I mean, how to be there for your friend both in happy and sad times, how to trust each other and most of all, appreciate each other. Green did a fantasic job in illustrating this and I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a simple, fun, and yet sophisticated book.	2003-02-16

Basically, the book deals with the earlier lives of both Todd and Lisa Beamer, what type of childhood they had, their campus involvement and the spiritual environment in which they grew up in. I felt that this is part of the book is very important because it will influence Lisa after the September 11 disaster which took away her husband. Lisa's faith in God was strengthened and relied heavily on God that He has plans for her and Todd. Most people would have been mad, grief-stricken and might not even function but Lisa overcomes these feelings by trusting God. <br />In addition, the book also provides insight into the lives of those who are forever transformed because of 9/11. More important is the insights on the passengers of Flight 93 leaving Newark which was hijacked and crashed in Pennslyvania. The flight was believed to be heading towards Washington and the Lisa provides crucial information that she puts together which shows that the passengers sabotaged the hijackers' intention of heading towards Washington. I really like this book because I feel that it has strengthen my faith in God and not to doubt Him but just surrender myself to Him. In addition, the love between Lisa and Todd is very strong and sincere and at times, I feel that I really know them personally. It is written beautifully, and do not attempt to be too philosophical but deep enough that will cause you to think about life in general. More important, it also makes us realize that we are not, for the most part, in control of things that happen, but we are, as Lisa puts it, in control of our actions. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn more about love, life and faith.	2003-02-04

The beginning of the book which I find most interesting deals with how John McEnroe began his tennis career and a little background information about himself. It also depicts the life of a young tennis player, the expectations and pressure that he had to deal with. Also somewhat interesting was the politics of tennis, the importance of ranking and in general the world of tennis players. However, three quarters of the book deals with the career of McEnroe, detailing every match he had ever played. It can be extremely boring after 50 pages of the same thing and I think he should have only highlighted some of the more important matches of his career. I cannot but help feel that he seems to go into great length of matches that he won but mentioned briefly those that he lost. A reviewer said if you're not a tennis fan, this is not the book for you. However, I would like to say if you're not a McEnroe fan, you should definitely avoid this book. <br />As a tennis fan, I thought there would be more insights in this book but was brutally disappointed. If you are hoping to get motivations, personal struggle, rags to riches type stories, this will not be the book. The book is shallow and personally, I find myself not respecting McEnroe as much as I did before I read his book. I have to agree with another reviewever that he seems to find excuses in what seems like everything such as his divorce to his first wife, lost matches, fines, etc.	2003-01-26

Jeanne, had to leave her life when her father died and she was left with the responsibility of caring for her mother. Harper gives a detailed account of what Jeanne had to go through to care for her mother, ranging from inadequate sleep to frequent disturbances from her mother. It also increases her anxiety as she was constantly worried that her mother would do something (without meaning to) to harm herself. Adding to the backdrop of this is the life of Jeanne, how she dropped out of college, got pregnant, married the wrong guy. She was not having a good relationship with her son, and basically, she was not happy. <br />I like this book because I think the author paints a realistic picture of Alzheimer's and that it is hardest for people to care for the ill. Sufferers of Alzheimer's are totally different people from who they were and every day is an attempt to survive and to be mentally stable as you need to be focus when you take care of the ill. It is also a full time job and that others around you might not understand what you're going through unless they experience it themselves. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about Alzheimer's more from the view point of those who take care of the patients and how it affects their lives.	2002-11-02

This storyline is thin, hardly any plots, and the characters are very lame. The book deals with the Chandler brothers, who had a coin toss to see who would find a wife and have children in order to satisfy their mother's wish for grandchildren. Roman, a foreign correspondent lost the toss and agree to be on a quest to find a wife. All he wanted was to marry her, have kids and then leave the country to continue his job.<br />This book reminds me of the teenage books I used to read, where all the characters are dashing, irresistible and intelligent and the heroines are equally irresistible, beautiful, wonderful and kind. The author did not let her readers discover the inner personality of her characters but on a numerous occasion, just simply states them, such as the Chandlers men were extremely loyal. Both the main characters, Roman and his high school sweetheart (like the teenage books) did not want each other even though they secretly desire to be one another. And of course, you can very well predict the ending even within the first few pages of the book. In addition, the book also lack humor and this would definitely be harmful to the Kelly Ripa's book club. However, if you want to read an extremely simple book, basic writing and predictable happy ending, then maybe this book is for you. But, bear in mind, this is not a feel-good book or a book that average person can relate to.	2002-10-21

Her main problem is that she is a compulsive shopper and because of that, she gets herself into trouble with banks, the credit card company and she even owes money to her roommate Suze. Deep in debt, Rebecca is also depressed as she feels that her life is static, with a so-so career, no boyfriend and is constantly hassled by the banks and credit card companies urging her to pay. <br />Kinsella gives a good insight into the life of a shopaholic and how a person can get into serious trouble if she/he is not cautious. Not a shopaholic myself, I always find it difficult to understand how people can get into debt just by buying clothes, or any other things. Reading this book makes me realize that this habit can be considered a disease just like alcoholism. Even though shopaholics know that it is wrong to keep buying especially since the bank letters piled up, they seemed to have no self-control. The moral of the book is that, shop but have self-control and be moderate. I highly recommend this book for all the shopaholics and non-shopaholics out there. It doesn't matter which group you belong, you'll learn something from \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic.\\" Not to mention that it is highly entertaining.	2002-10-02

Jack is a instructor in creative writing and was in the midst or writing the &quot;Great American Novel.&quot; Freya, desparately needed a boyfriend to attend her sister's wedding in England and the rest of the story is predictable as Jack agreed to be her &quot;boyfriend&quot; in England and they developed feelings for each other. Sisman does a good job in letting her readers know the stuborn personalities of both the main characters. Freya and Jack are not very likeable characters as they both are always circling looking for happiness and defying their families' values. <br />This is not a spectacular book that will leave you speechless but it entertaining in its way. There are some humor in the book, especially the part where Freya and Jack are always on each other's nerve, staying together. However, the secondary character such as Cat (Freya's best friend) can be developed more because at the moment, it seems like the author just added Cat in for the sake of it. Also, the author leaves her readers dissatisfied as the ending seems rushed especially dealing with Freya and Jack's relationships with their fathers respectively.	2002-09-09

Also, I am amazed that some readers wanted to know if they were going to meet even though it said clearly in &quot;Bridges of Madision County&quot; that they would not meet. <br />The author's writing skills is great and very personal. The book is short but especially intense and deep. Waller has the ability to bring and draw his readers into the story and just mesmerize his readers. Some might not like this book or feel dissatisfied because the ending is not what they want even though the ending was already determined in the previous book. I do agree that Waller should not dwell on the Kincaid past quite that much. However, I still think this is still a great story. I also highly recommend that the readers should read &quot;Bridges of Madison County&quot; first in order to understand better the story.	2002-09-09

There were a lot of arguments, misunderstanding and conflicts between the mother and daughter. One of the main reasons was due to the fact that Vivi used to hit Sidda with a belt and that memory was stuck to Sidda's mind. She tried to understand her mother and learn more about Vivi's life through Vivi's long-time buddies, the Ya-Yas and a scrapbook that Vivi put together called the &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.&quot; <br />Reading the scrapbook gave Sidda a glimpse into her mother's life when she was young, from attending the premiere of &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; to various pictures of her mother having fun with the Ya-Yas. In addition, the scrapbook consisted of letters written to and from Vivi, newspaper clippings, among others. While learning something from the scrapbook, Sidda also had unanswered questions from it. That was when the Ya-Yas came to the rescue and explained to her certain events that took place.<br />Using the as a backdrop, Rebecca Wells seek to explain very vividly the lives of these young Ya-Yas and the events that they went through, particularly Vivi. They were once young, lively and had tons of experience under the belts. Vivi, is especially an interesting character as she is very lively, smart, popular and very loyal to her friends. Another major theme of the book is the close friendships of the Ya-Yas as they were loyal and had each other's interest in their minds and were always there for each other. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a relaxing book and at the same time glances into the lives of four close friends who can always rely on each other.	2002-08-28

Nell, dominating, bossy, and smart woman found herself alone after her husband left her for a younger woman, resolves to forget the past and started working for a detective company. Her friends, Margie and Suze were also having problems with their marital lives and as they became involved in Nell's life, they soon find themselves involved in a web of intrigue, spying (for the detective company) and were even kidnapping a dog! <br />The basis of the story is pretty typical - husband leaving wife for a younger woman, wife working hard all this time and suddenly, left alone to start again. However, this is different from other novels because there are humor, in the book, especially revolving the detective agency, whose boss, Nell fell in love with. It is also interesting how these three women coped with problems and relied on each other for support. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to have a relaxing, and funny book. It is easy to read and at the same time, the plot is very interesting with lots of characters.	2002-08-10

When the war was over, Julia, Victoria and Claire had to get their lives back together as they had suffered tremendously and worst of all, without hope for their future. So, Julia, got together with her elder sister Victoria to make this wedding dress for Claire who felt that she did not have future or any prospects. Unlike her older sisters, Claire was young and unmarried. The wedding dress was their hope for future and Julia was determined to find someone for Claire despite the fact that the aftermath of war, such as poverty was lingering. <br />This book is very slow, and the plot is very thin. I understand the author's intention of depicting the wedding dress as the hope for the sisters in an extremely bleak future. However, I find it hard to believe that after the war, with shortage of food, friends and neighbors losing their loved ones, that these problems did not seem to affect the Atwaters at all. There is definitely a bigger problem than what the author portrayed. I was disappointed that the author did not deal a whole lot with the aftermath of war and made the Atwaters seemed, at times, very vain and shallow. At the end of the book, you feel like you didn't get a whole lot out of the book and it is one of those books that you forgot you actually read before.	2002-07-31

This book is about a journalist, Jasmin Field (also known as Jazz) who auditioned for roles in the play, adapted from Jane Austen's book. Here, she met the abominable Harry Noble, dashing Hollywood star whom she absolutely cannot bear. But, of course, at the end they fell in love. Simple. That is the main theme of the book and other characters such as her sisters, Georgia and Josie, and best friend Mo also play center roles in the life of Jasmin Field.<br />The book deals a lot with Jazz's relationships with her sisters and best friend, and how she needs to come to terms with herself that you may not agree with the choices that people make but you at least need to respect that. Her world suddenly &quot;crashes&quot; when she realized that her career and family's reputation were at stake and for the first time, questioned her judgment and beliefs. This book is simple, and easy to read. It is relaxing, funny at times and offer insights into the life of a journalist, who writes with passion and who values her own opinion highly. The author, Melissa Nathan's writing is clear, precise and avoids jargons that might confuse the readers.	2002-07-15

Miles Ryan, a deputy sheriff had to deal with the hit and run accident which killed his beloved wife. It was extremely difficult for Miles to &quot;get over&quot; the accident, as there was no closure and he had to deal with the frustruation of not catching the culprit who ruined his life. Sarah, was left by her husband because she was unable to conceive, and left Boston for New Bern to start a new life. There, she met Miles. And, of course they fell in love. Just as their relationship was progressing to another level, Sarah discovered a secret which could meant an end to their relationship.<br />The storyline was pretty predictable especially with the synopsis provided by the publisher. Nevertheless, this is still a great story, as it deals with real life issue, such as grieving, moving on and forgiveness. The book also shows that friends and family members can provide a great source of support when life gets tough. In addition, I think Sparks does a good job in depicting the tightness of communities in small town. This is my first Nicholas Sparks book and I enjoy it very much.	2002-07-14

I really like this book because it is funny, sweet and at the same time sad. The story deals with three women who decided to have a reunion, after 19 years in Maine to catch up each other's life. Each one of these women, Madison, Leslie and Ellie has something in their past which ruined their lives and they were offered a chance by Madame Zoya to travel back to the past for three weeks to change their lives, if they choose to do so. I think this is really interesting as these women are offered the chance to correct the mistakes they made or the one decision which changed their lives, with the knowledge of the future.  <br />I think the storyline is ingenius and I feel that I know the characters personally. It is just so satisfying when I am done reading. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something that is light and is about romance. If you're one of the readers who want something that is logical, and who frown upon stuff like fortune tellers, etc, this is not the book for you.	2002-06-07

This book is a compilation of her journals which she kept faithfully throughout her years with the Kiowas, with entries that include personal reflection and testimonies from the Kiowa people. Crawford brought a unique perspective to life on a Native American reservation at the turn of the century. Crawford showed that most Kiowas respected her and she also had a favorable view of the Kiowas. <br />Most of her entries were written from a Christian's perspective and how she tried to share gospel with the Kiowas and in fact, many became Christians because of her. Crawford also with the help of the Kiowas built a church at Saddle Mountain, Oklahoma. Unlike some missionaries who preached to save the &quot;savages&quot;, Crawford truly respected their cultural identity and in fact sought a middle ground, where cultural exchange took place. She told them that becoming a Christian would not change their identities. <br />This book is valuable because it contains speeches, conversations and testimonies given by the Kiowas which can help to increase our understanding of both their culture and the complexity of their relationship with missionaries.	2002-06-06
US	50001942	R1IE7AWQ2F7D2D	B000062UHX	184600193	Never Change	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Slow-paced	Initially, when I first read this book, I thought the conversations that Myra had with her patients were extremely boring but as I continue to read the book, I began to understand why Elizabeth Berg included them in her story. As a reader, I learn a lot about what type of person Myra is by her conversations and how she care and interact with her patients. She's not your typical heroine, beautiful, rich with a great job and everyone falls in love with her, Myra is a wallflower, not capable of expressing herself to others and just loving herself. She is contented and at the same time, feels that she lack something in life. <br />That changes, when she falls in love with her new patient, Chip Reardon, a guy she had a crush on in high school. Even though Chip was slowly dying of brain tumor, he teaches Myra how to love herself and how to love life. In a way, he understands her more than she does of herself. <br />If you're looking for a exciting love story, this book is not for you. It's slow-paced, with some mundane details and personally, I had difficulty getting through at the beginning but I slowly grew to enjoy the book.	2002-05-31

Suzanne, left a diary for her son, Nicholas and it detailed her life, her expectations, how she met her future husband and how she dealt with her illness. Her diary was left to Matt's girlfriend, Katie (after the death of Suzanne) so that Katie could understand the difficulties that Matt was going through.<br />The characters in the book are very \\"real\\" and you feel as though you know them personally. This is a story of determination, courage, survival and most importantly, love for living, love for your family members and love for yourself. However, I am not satisfied with the ending, as Patterson did not deal with the period after the death of Suzanne to the time he met Katie. I am also disappointed because, personally, I believe if the love with Suzanne and Matt is so real, which in the book is very real, he would not be able to find a replacement for Suzanne that quickly, if it is possible at all. I guess, I wish the author addresses this issue. Otherwise, I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a relaxing yet hard-to-put-down book.	2002-05-24

Most people, have focused on Iwo Jima, Peleliu, and Okinawa to learn more about the ordeals of soldiers in World War II and have often \\"forget\\" about these brave souls in Philipines. In \\"Ghost Soldiers\\", Hampton Sides gives these forgotten soldiers, voices. <br />This book deals with both the successful rescue effort by the 6th Ranger and the ordeal of the prisoners of war. It is extremely exciting when Sides portrays the difficulties and the obstacles that these Rangers encountered in reaching behind the enemy line. The Rangers, well aware of the danger ahead, put their lives at stake to rescue fellow Americans. The rescue would not have been successful without the cooperation of the Philippinos guerillas who were willing to risk their lives to rescue the Americans. <br />The prisoners of war were brutally abused by the Japanese army and they suffered from diseases, malnutrition which caused blindness, and were constantly living in fear. The psychological torture made the men cling on to each other for support and help. The prisoners did not expect to see the rescuers that when the Rangers showed up, some did not want to leave as they believed that it was too good to be true. The last few chapers were very emotional as the prisoners finally got what they have wanted but dare not wish - freedom. One quote in the book said, that the prisoners would definitely go to heaven when they died as they have already lived through hell. <br />This is an extremely powerful book as it shows courage, determination, and most importantly, the will to survive. However, I wish Sides would use footnotes as that would make his book more credible instead of briefly mentioning the sources at the end of the book. That should not prevent readers who are intersted in learning more about the survivors of the Bataan Death March and serves as a reminder of how precious lives are.	2002-05-21

Their differences were what connected them. Soon, both chose a different lifestyle, Sula leaving for the big city, while Nel continued to stay at Medallion. The turning point came when Sula returned, and had an affair with Nel's husband. That was the end of their friendship. Both women suffered in their ways, as their friendship was lost, despite the fact that both women needed each other greatly. Despite the title \\"Sula\\", it actually dealt a lot more than just the friendship of these two women. Toni Morrison, gives a good portrayal of what was life like during the twenties and what it was like for an African-American woman to live in those times. <br />Personally, I did not enjoy the book as I felt that it is too bleak for my taste and I still feel that there are some questions (that I have) left unanswered. I think the strengths of the book lies with her provocative way of writing, and her understanding of what it meant to be an African-American woman, whereby their status were greatly undermined. In addition, Morrison also deals with the complexities of family relationships, and her book also displays the importance of two-way communication between family members, friends and spouses. Judging by other Amazon.com reviewers, I think this book have different meanings for different people and this is what makes the book special and different.	2002-05-09

Most scholarly literatures dealt with the Holocaust, or the massacres committed by both the German and Japanese army. There was little literature on the forced prostitution or the rape of Asian women during World War II. Hicks gives a very detailed analysis of the Comfort Women, in parts of East Asia and Southeast Asia.<br />Japanese prostitutes were initially recruited to provide \\"services\\" to the Japanese army but that proved insufficient as the war expanded and the number of soldiers increased. Soon, the Imperial Army began to employ South Korean prostitutes but that proved insufficient too. Soon, young women, from South Korea, and other Asian countries, such as Malaysia, were coerced, or kidnapped to become sex slaves to the Army. They were sometimes lead into believing that they would work in factories where they could earn decent livings but only to realize (after they had left homes) later, that they would be \\"serving\\" these men, sometimes, 10-30 times a day.<br />The most gruesome part of the book was the personal accounts of these young women. They ranged from 12-18 years old, and one lady, Madame X from Malaysia was gang raped in front of her family before being transported to a comfort station where she had to serve a lot of men. These women, faced the danger of disease, malnutrition or just the possibility of being killed at the battlefields. If they refused to perform, they would be severely beaten and sometimes killed. Sometimes, the army would also arranged for them to perform sex at the frontlines, where the pillboxes were transformed into comfort rooms. One would think that everything would be back to normal after the war had ended. After the war, these women had to bear the psychological effects of the war. Some were terrified of men and sex and most were unable to reproduce. <br />This is a well-researched book, that provides insights into the lives of these comfort women. It shows the brutality of the Japanese Imperial Army and how these women suffered both physically and psychologically.	2002-05-06

Some of the &quot;Chinese&quot; or &quot;Asian&quot; cookbooks are sort of &quot;Americanized&quot; but not this one. For instance, the &quot;Sweet and Sour Pork&quot; which is very tasteful unlike those which you can get from Chinese fastfood which are dripping with red sauce. Another benefit of this book is that it has step by step instructions, and at the beginning of the book, she explains various types of Asian noodles, what type of knife to get, what is the proper way of cutting the meat or vegetables and how to fry, which I find extremely helpful. Most cookbooks do not explain how to do all this things and just give you the recipes, expecting you to know how to do everything. Also, it comes with colorful pictures of all the dishes which I find motivating (for me to try the recipes.)	2002-04-03

The author seems to know the region where the Great Smoky Mountains is in, well. She traces the history of the Smokies and of the people living there. She analyzes how the Smokies came to be under the federal government's jurisdiction and how the landscape was changed profoundly.<br />What I find most interesting is the attempt by a superintendent's effort to preserve the mountains as pristine as possible but he came up with some strong objections by surrounding residents who were concern about bringing money in to the region. Also, surrounding towns began to flourish as attractions like Ripley Believe it or Not and even Dollywood became the focus of tourists going to the Smokies to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. It's almost ironic that there is such drastic difference between the Smokies, where wilderness is preserve and the very commericialized towns surrounding the mountains.	2002-03-18

Unlike most historians who contributes the environmental degradation to Euro-Americans, Isenberg shows that Native Americans also play a role in modifying the ecology. He is able to show how introduction of horses, made Native Americans became more mobile and therefore were able to hunt the bison while riding their horses.<br />Initially, the Natives hunted for subsistence but later were drawn into the market-oriented economic system and were trading the bison's skin for other European products. Gradually, bison became nearly decimated.<br />This is an incredible book in this survey of the history of the North American bison population and is very well-written. He organizes this book well and is very readable. Even if readers who do not have prior knowledge of bison or is unfamiliar with the field of environmental history, this book will not pose any difficulty for understanding the complex relationship between human and the environment around them.	2002-03-15

Crosby examines the reason Europeans were able to defeat the Indigenous people in American, Australia and New Zealand. Crosby argues that the biology and ecology factors played tremendous roles in their win. Crosy argues that the weeds, animals and the Europeans best allies, the germs or diseases that they brought with them to the New World dominated the Indigenous people. The Europeans sought to make the New World as similiar to that of the Old World. It was interesting for me because we were taught that the military superiority of the Europeans was the main factor. In addition, Crosy also examines the unsuccessful attempts of the Europeans at dominating Asia and Africa. <br />&quot;Ecological Imperialism&quot; definitely is a groundbreaking book in the field of environmental history.	2002-02-08

Eleanor of Acquitaine was an exceptional woman, in that she changed the course of history for both England and France when she divorced the King of France, Louis and eight weeks later, married the King of England, Henry II. When she was with Louis, she was unable to produce male heirs but when she married Henry, she was able to produce a few male heirs. <br />Meade brought us back to when Eleanor was a child and how she grew up to be as powerful as she did. During the medieval period, women were powerless and they were only used to produce male heirs. Eleanor, however, was different. She was manipulative, cunning, intelligent, highly educated, cultured and ambitious. <br />After her marriage to Henry, Meade examined her relationship with Henry and her sons. Henry, like most Kings, was extremely unfaithful and brought his mistress, Rosamund to replace Eleanor, unofficially. Eleanor, took her revenge on Henry by encouraging her sons to rebel against their father. <br />That is the gist of the book but it consists a lot more dramas and turmoils than I am able to write here. This book is extremely readable.... Even if you don't have any previous knowledge on Europe medieval history. It's in a way very &quot;soap opera&quot; like and very exciting to read. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about medieval history and who is interested in Eleanor.	2002-02-06

It was especially difficult for Erin and her sibblings as her parents had to pay full attention to her sister and neglected the rest of them and how each one of the family members need to come to term with Dana's illness. It was especially hard for Erin because Dana was her best friend and it was heartbreaking to see someone you love and care is slowly deteriorating and is suffering every day. <br />Slowly, Erin lost faith in praying and in God as she believed it was useless since so many people prayed for Dana and yet Dana was not recovering. It was touching for me, how Dana restored Erin's faith and how the family was able to go through Dana's illness with prayers and faith in God.<br />Also, I think this book gives a good picture on how it's like to have a family member who is being diagnosed with cancer as it drains out everyone who loves the patient. One of the quotes in the book said something like cancer is like a magnet, it draws one closer to God.	2002-01-20

Even though I don't know a thing about Lance Armstrong nor cycling, it is certainly easy to get &quot;into&quot; the book. Lance Armstrong traced his childhood, how he became an athlete, how he was exposed to cycling and how he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. It was very amazing to me when he said at the beginning of the book that cancer was the best thing that ever happened to him. I couldn't believe that but as I continue reading his book, it seem unbelievably true. <br />It was also interesting to read how cancer changed his perspective on life, his priorities and just getting a second chance to live again. His endurance, persistance to live and win the Tour De France was inspirational. I think what impresses me was no so much that he won the title but the way he fought to win it. <br />I think Armstrong also accomplished an unintentional aim - that is to tell his readers that cycling is not as easy as it look. It takes a lot of patience, endurance and strategies to beat your competitors. <br />In addition to that, it was very touching to see Armstrong's friends and family members stood by him and how their moral support helped him through the most difficult time of his life. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about survivorship.	2002-01-12

It gives a very fascinating insights on the Pacific theater during World War II. A lot of books tend to focus on the European theater but as Manchester shown, it was just as important. It's very important to bear in mind (as the author said at the end of the book) that the book is not in a chronological order. <br />I think for those who wants to learn about each Marines battle, either in Tarawa, Guadalcanal or Okinawa, this is a good book to read as it Manchester gives background information on the battles or the war itself. I especially like the part where he explained in details how an amphibious assault works. In addition to all the historical information that were provided, Manchester succesfully personalize the book by giving his readers insights into life at boot camps, and later at Quantico for Officer Candidate School, etc. He managed to show that the &quot;human&quot; side of Marines as opposed to mere numbers and how they fought for each other, not the country, not the ideology.	2001-12-26

It was interesting to get a glimpse on how he felt emotionally, the friendship that was formed between the soldiers and how a lot of times, soldiers are fighting as hard as they did, for their friends because they did not want to let their them down. When Johnston was the section leader, he was able to show the burden of responsibilities as you were not just in charge of your life but of others too. <BR>Lastly, how he was disappointed with the Marines.

It's extremely heart-breaking to read these letters as they gives &quot;voices&quot; instead of a mere figure. A lot of times, the figure of how many were killed, wounded, missing, etc but it does not portray any &quot;emotions&quot; the soldiers felt. At the end of each letter, the editor includes a few sentences on what happened to the author. It's extremely sad to read how many of those killed were just 19 year-olds, 20 year-olds, and these soldiers were just kids! It makes you think how wasteful, stupid, unnecessary wars are, and the sacrifices that has to be made.<br />The last chapter of this book speaks a lot. It is chronologically listed and you can see the evolving sentiments of the soldiers. At the beginning of the war, the soldiers were proud to fight against the Communists, how they think the war will be over soon. Towards the end of that chapter, most soldiers were scared, depressed and just wanted to get out of the war... alive! This shows why many Vietnam War veterans suffered from postwar depression as the horror of the war, how their friends, buddies were killed or wounded in front of their own eyes and how many could not possibly forget these horrifying images.<br />I highly recommend this book as this book speaks a lot. To me, the important message that it is trying to convey is the unnecessary sacrifices that these soldiers have to make, to fight a war that is not theirs, and the horror and bloodiness of the war is vividly described by these soldiers.	2001-12-03

Many Holocaust historians tend to approach the Jewish history from the male perspective (as men were involved in politics). Kaplan sought to explain the importance of women's roles in the Jewish society and how Jewish women urged their husbands to leave Germany when the Nazi gained power and influence. <br />Kaplan also sought to explain what it felt like to be a Jew living under the Nazi regime and how they became isolated from the rest of the society. She also explained how by and large Germans participated in this persecution and by this she did not mean physical persecution but social persecution.<br />She gave special attention to the Jewish women and how the women tried to adapt to their new roles and the new situation. The women were able to provide mental and emotional support to their families when their husbands lost their jobs. It was indeed insightful to see how the women were able to cope and how they were the first group to realize the isolation that took place, mainly because of their interaction with neighbors, store owners, public officials, etc. <br />I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn more about the Jewish life under Nazi Germany and the focus here is not those who suffered under the concentration camps but the &quot;ordinary people&quot; who had to cope with their new situation.	2001-11-30

This book deals with Samantha, whose husband divorced her and she had to deal with raising her 11 year-old son and she needed to learn to be independent financially and emotionally.<br />It would be more interesting if the author develops the supporting characters better and the main character, Samantha's relationship with her mother remains &quot;hostile&quot;.

The theme of this book is how she rebuilds her relationship with her mother, how she misunderstood her mom when she was young and finally, she understood why her mom was the way she was. She learns more about her family roots and finally came to an understanding that, the plantation was where she belonged. <br />The book is fills with warmth, love, and just what we need to relax and have a good laugh.

Adolescent girls in the Victorian era, were sexually repressed, wore corsets, recognizing that virginity as the highest value in womanhood.<br />Brumberg felt that the decline of parental supervision, the emerging consumer culture and other factors contributed to the different values of adolescent girls. Mothers and daughters should definitely read this book to understand the complex problems that arise as girls deal with peer pressure and society that place importance in having the &quot;perfect&quot; physical appearance.	2001-11-15

The main purpose of this book is to explain the changes in landscape before and after the Europeans arrived.<br />Cronon was able to provide an examination of the three-way relationship between the Indians, Europeans and the environment. He was able to show how they interact with one another and he explained the Europeans' lack of understanding on the ecosystem. He was not bias in his explanation, and &quot;blamed it all&quot; on the Europeans because the Indians were, on their part, participated in the trade willingly, and thus, were thrown into the European market economy. However, he did explain that this whole process was initiated by the Europeans.<br />Cronon did an excellent job in explaining the complex relationship between the Indians, Europeans and the environment. It is not possible to study the Indian-Europeans relationship without including the environment in their interaction which a lot of historians tend to do.	2001-11-14

Professor Carole Levin examines how Elizabeth I was able to use her role as a woman (where traditionally, the public viewed women as incapable, weak, dependant) to her advantage and at the same time she ruled like a &quot;King&quot;. Levin also examined how Elizabeth was so successful in her reign and at the same time, she was not the typical &quot;woman&quot; of her time; she was childless, and unmarried. She portrayed herself as a &quot;Virgin Queen&quot; - as in she was married to her country. <br />It is important to note that this is not a biography of Elizabeth I but a book that gives a new perspective of Elizabeth I, that helps us to understand the overlapping of politics with gender and sexuality. Levin did an excellent job in using unconventional sources such as gossips, rumors, religious works, diplomatic correspondence that makes it a distinctive scholarly work. This book is also very easy to read, and even if you don't have a substantial backgroup in pre-modern European history, you will not have a problem in reading this book	2001-10-19

She talks about the changing roles that these women played, from 19th century, when women played limited roles in society, how they were still influenced by traditional Chinese values to post war where they participated in the war effort, gained independence and had an active role in the society. <br />The main theme of this book is the discrimination they faced being Chinese and women. It is astounding to see how far they have come, from the days when Chinese school children were being called &quot;Chinks&quot; and were excluded from the mainstream society because of their gender and race.<br />This book would definitely appeal to those who come from minority communities and to those who are interested in ethnic, women or immigration history. I definitely recommend this book as it deals with issues that have so far been ignored in our textbooks, but definitely played a major role in shaping our society today.	2001-10-05

Baldacci gives a vivid description of the mountains in Virgina that makes one wants to go there. When Jack Cardinal, a popular writer died in an accident, Lou and her brother Oz, who were living in New York City had to move to Virginia to stay with their great grandmother, Louisa. Lou's mother, Amanda, was in coma. Baldacci talks about the difficulty that Lou and Oz faced in adjusting to a totally different environment, where they learned to farm, etc.<BR>In the midst of all this, Lou learns more about her family, and developed close relationship with her great grandmother.<br />This is a good historical fiction and Baldacci uses a lot of oral testimonies from his family (He is originally from Virginia) that makes it very &quot;real.&quot; He also teaches us a lesson, that even though we may think we know our parents, it doesn't hurt to sit down, ask them questions and we may be surprised to learn things we never knew.	2001-09-30

He was admitted to the university and he majored in English. <br />This book is disappointing as you feel like he wrote this book for the sake of writing it. It's quite &quot;draggy&quot; too and it took me forever to finish reading this book unlike Angela's Ashes (Which took me 2 days). I still read it or rather finish reading it because, in a way, I want to know what happened to the Irish boy who left Limerick, Ireland to return to the U.S. (Where he was born)	2001-09-27

One of Takaki's aims in this book is to tell his readers the role of Asian-Americans in shaping the history of America. Many, he believes, held the view that being an American means being \\"white\\" which is far from the truth.<br />Takaki uses a variety of sources such as personal recollection, oral testimonies, newspapers, court cases, personal observations, among others. This makes his writings very credible indeed. <br />One of Takaki's aim is to bring a deeper understanding of Asian-Americans to his readers. Reading his book enables you to understand the Asian culture, their beliefs, ideas and why they become who they are today. Besides that, Takaki does not focus on only one ethnic group but several others that make up the so called &quot;Asian American&quot; minority group.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about Asian Americans and the roles they played in shaping America today. It is important to learn about different ethnic group as the history of America is essentially a history of immigrants and it is important for us not to neglect this minority group which has made tremendous contributions to the nation and its society.	2001-09-17

This story is about Susan Hayes who had to deal with an unfaithful husband, rebellious daughter and a persistent but loving sister. She had unresolved issues from her childhood and how that affected her now. My favorite character in the book is Livvie who is their housekeeper/nanny but has the wisest advice in the world.<BR>This book also gives its readers who are not from the South, and inside look of how it feels to be living in the South and how they think and intereact with one another. If you're looking for a touching, mesmerizing story that will stay in your mind for some time, this is the book that will do it.

It's unbelievable that a little girl of 5 years old can endure so much and yet succeed and stand up to the horror of the Khmer Rouge goverment. There are not as many literatures on the horror of communist Pol Pot's dictatorship as they do on China. <br />Loung Ung's father was a government official before the Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia. Ung's family had to flee from Phnom Penh as all previous government officials will be killed and the book showed how much of poverty and hunger that their family had to suffer. The way Ung described the way children and adults were killed was terrifying and how even if people were not killed by the army, they would die of hunger, food-poisoning, etc.<br />This book is very easy to understand as the author said it the way she saw it. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about Cambodia, their culture and the genocide that was commited by the Khmer Rouge.	2001-08-23

It consists of a teacher and students' entries that they put together into a book. When reading this book, it will also make you sit up and listen to these young students' cries for justice. Most of the students were involved in gang activities, drugs, violence in family, poverty and how all this prevent them from getting education. The students were also afraid of their lives as they have friends, family members who get shot. The racial differences were hightened after the Rodney King incident in Los Angeles. .... <br />The book is divided according to class years, and it is very encouraging to see the changes, development that these students underwent and how they manage to overcome obstacles in order to graduate. Along the way, they met many important people, among them the Secretary of Education and they promised themselves that they want to make a difference and sought the non-violent ways to express their frustruation. <br />It is very inspiring to see what a person can make such a huge difference in other people's lives.

Poverty was something that his family struggled with and it did not help the situation as his father was a hard-core alcoholic who prefers to spend his dole money on drinks even though his family is barely surviving. McCourt also had to deal with the deaths of his sibblings due to improper care and lack of food. <br />I like this book a lot because it makes us think of how fortunate we are, to have food, loved ones and at times, we don't appreciate what we have. This book also gives a good perspective of how difficult times were after the Great Depression and how World War II were able to provide jobs for a lot of people and helped to boost the economy. <br />I think this book is quite funny too besides the problems faced by the McCourts. The author did a great job in observing his surroundings and also find humors in difficult times.	2001-08-08

However, I must say that &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; is not as good as I thought it'll be.<br />This book deals with the relationship between Homer Wells, an orphan and Dr. Wilbur Larch, who runs the orphanage. Even though abortion is illegal, women still find their ways to St. Cloud if they need an abortion or after deliveries, they'll leave their babies there for adoption. Homer's relationship with Dr. Larch grew closer over time, even though they never admitted to each other how important the other person is. Homer also learns from Dr. Larch, how to deliver a baby and at the same time, also learns how to give abortions. <br />Homer did not think that abortion is right but he thinks women have a right to choose whether they want to give birth to unwanted babies or not. He, however, would not do it himself personally.<br />This book deals a lot of abortion and even though the author showed us the pro and con of it, I cannot but feel that the author is leaning towards pro-choice. I think this book would be a lot better if Irving would develop more about Homer's objection to abortion.	2001-07-27

This book is enjoyable to read because it is simple, easy, heartwarming and definitely inspiring. It tells of Homer Hickam Jr.'s dream of building launching a rocket in smalltown, Coalwood, West Virginia and what he did to accomplish that dream. Many saw bleak future for Coalwood, a mining town, which was slowly dying. Hickam, and his friends (Quentin, Roy Lee, Billy, Sherman, O'Dell)- known as &quot;The Rocket Boys&quot; went through many failures to make their dream come true. Their efforts, changed their fates and futures.<br />One of the reviews from the book says &quot;Rocket Boys .... rewards every mother and teacher who ever told children they could be anything they wanted if they worked hard enough.... The memory of a special time remains for Hickan and everyone who ever dreamed of soaring to the stars&quot; by The Orlando Sentinel.<br />Hickam's mother and teacher played an important role in encouraging him to have aims, plans, for his future and should not be content in working in his father's mine. Her favorite phrase whenever Hickam experimented with building and launching rockets was &quot;Just don't blow yourself up&quot;.<br />Hickam did a good job in describing the events that took place during his childhood and teenage years, giving his readers a better outlook on the beliefs, ideas, of the late 50s and 60s. from the launch of Sputnik by the Russians to the election campaign of John F. Kennedy.<br />This book ultimately challenge me to dream and take action. It's important for children and adults to have dreams and make it come true as the process of making it come true is often more rewarding than the reward itself.	2001-07-11

I read this book as part of my Native American History class and I truly enjoy this book. &quot;Cherokee Removal&quot; brings its readers, chronologically to the inevitable &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; where the government brought in troops and forced the Cherokees into stockades where they walked to Oklahoma, in terrible conditions, insufficient food, and a lot of the Cherokees died during the journey.<br />This books gave its readers access to primary documents, such as treaties, and letters written by Cherokees themselves, and it presents both views, from Euro-Americans who supported removal, who opposed removal and likewise for the Cherokees.  By examining the primary documents, we can gain insights into how leaders like Andrew Jackson thought of the removal as a crucial step for Cherokees &quot;survival&quot;. <br />The state of Georgia, defying the Supreme Court's rulling in Worcester v Georgia, in favor of the Cherokees, brought in troops, seize the Cherokee's printing press, etc.<br />By reading this book, one can't help but feel that greed, ethoncentricity can bring people to be blinded by their own prejudice and make mistakes that bring such tragic consequences.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about the Cherokee Removal as other native american tribes suffered basically the same.	2001-02-17

This book is divided into different time periods, for instance in 18th Century, the Comanches were nomadic people and after that, they stayed in reservations, etc. The author also explained the relationship between Comanches and the Euro-Americans and how the federal government implement various policies.<br />It's also interesting to see over time, what Comanches cultures persisted and what changes they are. One notable change was their economic activity which changed due to the economic and political situations. But one element that persisted over time was their kinship and friendship among themselves and how they can always rely on that even though everything else change.<br />This book explained the stereotypes that Euro-Americans have over the Native Americans and also what the Comanches thought of the Anglos (Euro-Americans)	2001-01-24

I think anyone who is interested to learn more about Communism in general should read this book. I think the author did a good job in analyzing the situation and providing insightful information on life under the communists. She gave a vivid account on how her husband, who held one a high position in the government was convicted and executed. Her life was practically ruined when people learned or led to believe that her husband was a traitor. She was denied of proper medical care, was fired at every job, was relocated to a shack and how everyone who assosiated themselves with her would lose their job.<br />What I like about this book is that we get to know how it was like for civilians and for people who were related to government officials, live. It was fearful, dark, full of betrayal and worst of all, selfishness. Even though people who carried out orders knew that it was not justified, they did nothing about it. Her husband, under illegal interogations and was led to believe that if he agreed to confess to those charges, the author and her child would be safe. In fact, it was far from it.<br />This book is a combination of both history and personal account which I find very interesting. Mrs Heda Margolius Kovaly bringing her readers from the time she was held in concentration camp to period when she returned to Prague and how communism took over the country.  Another book I would recommend is Nien Cheng's &quot;Life and Death in Shanghai&quot; which gave an account of life in prison, under constant interogation.	2000-12-22

However, I'm a little disappointed that she did not accept Nobu, the man who had waited for her for 15 years. Even though he may not be the &quot;dream guy&quot;, I think she at least owe it to him to repay for all the things he had done for her.<br />But of course, this is a matter of opinion and overall, I think this is a very interesting book as it gives us insight into the daily life of a Geisha, and not just the surface information that everyone know. I always imagine that in order to be a Geisha, all you need to do is to look and act pretty. But I was very wrong. The author did a fine job of telling his readers the different stages a girl has to go through to become a Geisha. It was also interesting to read the difficulty they had to go through in their training, the competition among themselves and on top of it all, they didn't have any choice. Like the book said &quot;You don't learn to become a Geisha, you learn to be a Geisha&quot;. <br />This book also gives me an understanding on the Japanese culture. One reviewer summarize it all .... This book is written by a MAN! You have to read the book to understand what I mean.	2000-12-20

If you plan to study extensively for the test, you should get this book too. Besides giving you strategies, they have plenty of exercises that you can practice and also one of their main feature is the 3,500 words that are commonly tested throughout the years.  In addition to that, if you have fears on the math part, they run you through possible questions and how to answer it. At the end, I think they have 3 sample tests which you can practice on. What I like best about this book is that, for instance, when I practice some of the exam questions, and if I get em' wrong which happens very often, I can look up the answer and they even tell you where to refer to in their chapters solutions for that kind of question.	2000-12-05

That is, at the beginning of every book, the author seems to write a lot about how Harry is suffering with his uncle, aunt and his cousin and I find that quite boring to a certain extend.

This book is a combination of &quot;Malory Towers&quot; by Enid Blyton, &quot;Famous Five&quot; and &quot;Secret Seven&quot; which makes it all enchanting to read.<br />I think this book gives us an opportunity to explore our fantasies and to dream of things we used to dream when we were young. It's relaxing, fun, exciting and at times scary. I won't bother explaining the sequence of events in the book as there are many reviews here that paints a good picture.<br />I would definitely recommend this book anytime, anywhere for anyone. This is more than just a &quot;Childrens&quot; book as I think it's appealing to everyone... and once you start reading it, you will find that it's hard to put it down.	2000-09-23

It's sweet,  funny, sad and witty. Owen Meany is an unforgetable charachter whose voice  is STRANGE and LOUD. He believes that he is an Instrument of God. Even  though he is extremely small, almost dwarf like, he never once felt  inferior or low self-esteem. If anything, he is witty, smart, intelligent  and very philosophical. His best friend, John Wheelwright, who is the  narrator of this book, was strongly influenced by his friend, both  emotionally and spiritually.<br />I would not review here what actually happen  to Owen at the end of the book as I believe this would spoil the joy and  sadness of discovering it yourself.<br />This is an excellent book,  descriptive and the characters in this book is unforgettable. After reading  it a while, you will feel connected to John and Owen and I wish this book  could go on forever as I am reluctant to put it down	2000-09-15
US	50001942	R2UGKL4PVTL5FU	0671042572	835489451	Jewel	Books	4	1	3	N	N	A touching story	This book deals with Jewel, who had an unhappy, tarnished childhood but finds love in her husband and 6 children. However, when she gave birth to  her last child, it was the turning point in her life. Her youngest daughter  Brenda Kay, had Down Syndrome and it was tough on her as in the 1940s and  1950s, people don't know much about Down Syndrome (which they called  Mongoloid Idiots during that time) and Jewel struggled to bring her up.  Jewel's unconditional love for her child had cost her relationship with her  husband and her other children and she gave all her attention to Brenda  Kay. The fact that Brenda Kay is different, made Jewel love her even more.  In a way, she sort of neglected her husband, her other children and don't  take into consideration her husband's feelings.<br />This is a slow book to  read and it's very descriptive too. You will feel connected to the  characters as you feel that you know a lot of them, their behaviors, and  beliefs. I would highly recommend this book to anyone as you'll learn a lot   from this book, especially if you don't have a clue of how life is with a  Down Syndrom child. It makes you understand the sacrifices parents have to  make and their love is always unconditional for their children, regardless  of whether how they are.	2000-08-13

The writer went to Japan in the  80s and lived with a Japanese family and through them, she wrote this book.  It deals especially with the relationship between a mother and her husband  and children. The mother assumed the more traditional role of Asian women  as she took care of everything and everyone in the household.<br />Besides  that, most of the time, when we think of Japan, we usually have in mind,  skyscrappers, the hectic life....but this book deals with the agriculture  side of Japan.<br />It is a must read book as the author did a fantasic job of  describing life in Japan as a foreigner, and the interaction she had with  the villagers who had never or seldom met a foreigner.	2000-08-10

When I first read  it, I couldn't put it down and I love this book! It's one of those books  that you can read again and again even though you know the story by  heart.<br />This story is based mainly on the life of Winnie Louie, an  immigrant from China and the tragedy of her past when she was in China. Her  past consists of her first marriage to an abusive man who never respect  her, her misfortunes and how she finally find a man who loves her. The  background of this story is set according to historical records -  especially during World War II, and how Winnie fled from places to places.  The core of this book is her relationship with her daughter, who was  totally Americanized, and how difficult it was for both to communicate and  to understand. Her daughter totally have no clue of what her mother had  been through, and at the same time, she could never fathom the  superstitions her mother believed in.<br />It is an extremely touching book,  and as you read the book, you will feel like you realy know the characters,  their beliefs, and a special bond will sort of developed. I would  definitely recommend this book anytime to anyone.	2000-08-04
US	50001942	R1SKJVPTXZVSQG	052166991X	636995957	The Cambridge Illustrated History of China	Books	5	33	36	N	N	Easy to understand	My Professor used this text and I find that it is easy to understand and read. One of the feature of this book is that at the end of every chapter,  the author would include her opinions and at the same time, she will relay  what happened in Europe or U.S. at that particular time. For instance, in  1700-1800, China was ruled by the last empire- the Manchu and it was also  during this time that the Americans gained independence. To me, it's always  nice to know what happened during a particular period in the opposite side  of the world.<br />I would strongly recommend this book for anyone who wants  to know more about the Chinese history as it's very easy to follow.	2000-08-02

For readers who don't know much about the Chinese History will find this extremely difficult to digest.  Besides that, I feel that the theme of this book is to discredit some of the myths  surrounding Tsu Hsi. Calling it a biography is misleading as it doesn't  focus entirely on her but more on the European biographers, their myths,  and the other Emperors of China.	2000-07-27

Nien Cheng gave a vivid picture of how life was, during the Cultural Revolution, especially for a person with foreign links like her. She proved to us that with persistence, courage, we can overcome anything we set our  mind to.  I would also recommend is &quot;Son of the Revolution&quot; by  Liang Heng who gave a &quot;Red Guard&quot;'s point of view of the Cultural  Revolution and also Jung Chang's &quot;Wild Swans&quot;.	2000-02-27
