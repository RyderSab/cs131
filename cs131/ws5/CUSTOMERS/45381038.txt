One important question I usually ask of myself after reading a book  (and always consider before recommending) is: if I could somehow erase my mind of this book, would I want to read it again?  The answer for this book would sadly be no.<br /><br />Just off a high from reading Wild Sheep Chase, I bought and immediately devoured Hard-Boiled Wonderland And The End Of The World.  At start I was encouraged with the completely unorthodox nature of the books unwilling protagonist, and the sexy, twisted descriptive writing style typical of Murakami.  A quick nod to translator Alfred Birnbaum (who I think translates most if not all Murakami's books), he better be well paid because if any writing has ever been augmented in translation, it might be these works.<br /><br />The book quickly got confusing (for someone of average intellect anyway).  Granted, weaving two universes together (a fantasy world, and physical one) isn't easy, but I don't think it had to be that hard.  The alternation by chapter really started to screw with my immersion, and really didn't pay any dividend until the end.<br /><br />The End is a subject I need to deal with carefully (as not to plot-spoil), so I'll just say this:  Rationally inclined readers will have an issue with the mysticism soaked wrap-up.  Not to say you need to be irrational to appreciate the ending, but as a Sci-Fi reader, I'm used to (and prefer) plots and endings that have some kind of plausible scientific potential for happening.  Perhaps I missed it, but scouring through the reviews, I found nobody that said anything about how his...ugh, can't spoil.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, this book in my opinion is not his best.  I would rather not have my mind erased and re-read Wild Sheep Chase than to read this book for the first time.<br /><br />Enjoy,<br /><br />Christian Hunter<br />Santa Barbara, California	2005-10-04

This 498 page compendium of stories that go back thousands of years (to Sumer), detail in extraordinary (sometimes stifling) detail, mankinds continuous love hate relationship with intoxication.  Be it with narcotics, hypnotics, stimulants, inebriants, or hallucinogens, mankind, for good or ill, loves to get f***'ed up.<br /><br />Hate that fact, or appreciate it; regardless, the global illicit market for narcotics is nearly half a trillion dollars and growing.  Growing despite centuries of government regulation, and, more recently, decades of intense global conflict.<br /><br />Richard Davenport-Hines makes a powerful argument against the war on drugs, but he doesn't do it like so many authors of that thought genre, who, between tokes, rant and rave about the plight of users, or the unfair religious influence on \\"modern\\" policy (no dig on them intended, that was my best attempt at humor now that all my malt balls are gone and it's 3am)...  Instead, the author makes a factual case, drawing in statistics that demonstrate clearly how ineffective public money is spent combating drug use.  The stats used aren't homogeneous to the US, many extensive statistics are used from our more experimental neighbors across the Atlantic.<br /><br />Like many, I believe this book could have been condensed considerably without losing its argumentative efficacy.  However, there were more than enough compelling stats and human stories to keep me engaged.  Among them, stories of the founding of Coca Cola, or the first western experimentors with Cannibus, or the lengths some have gone to stay intoxicated...fascinating stuff.<br /><br />If you have a particular interest in understanding the relationship between man, drugs, government, and the societal impacts of interrelationship between them, then run and get this book.  If however, you have a more casual interest, and would like to sharpen your argument for or against the war on drugs, walk to get this book, and skip chapters 2-5.<br /><br />Enjoy,<br /><br />Christian Hunter<br /><br />Santa Barbara, Californiars 2-5. <br /> <br />Enjoy, <br /> <br />Christian Hunter <br />Santa Barbara, California <br />	2005-03-30

I recently retired at 30...or so I thought.  Unfortunately, one can never truly retire, unless you have a particular immunity to the sound of your cash devaluing.  It was like nails on a blackboard to me, my dreams of ignoring business and wrapping myself in the arts; good food, better wine...all gone.  Gone with the realization of inflations dastardly influence on assets kept in cash.<br /><br />I knew I had to put money to work, but where?  Coming from \\"inside\\" corporate america, that is, with an operational focus, I've always had an aversion to investing time or money into that which I didn't know, and I know there's an art to everything (especially investing).  As a former CEO, I came into contact often with investors, and whether they were willing to pay more or less than my company's stock was worth wasn't the principal difference among them, the most striking difference was the amount of intelligence they brought to the analysis.  I would often sit in on meetings and wonder when they'd start asking the important questions, instead, most would work their understanding through totally different (and I thought much less efficient) vectors.  I always knew there was a much simpler means of analysis.<br /><br />This wonderful book is, for me, that analysis.  Laid out in plain easy to understand terms and instructions, Buffettology taught me how to objectively value publicly traded stock with discipline.<br /><br />So what did I do when I put my first money to work?  I ignored Buffettology's teachings, and bought stock in a company that I've always wanted, but Buffett would never buy.<br /><br />That cost me a car in my first week.<br /><br />Probably a cheap lesson in the grand scheme of things.  I'm dumping that stock tomorrow, sharpening my pencil, buying that BA 35 Solar calculator, and applying some Buffett style discipline from here on out.<br /><br />Wish me luck...no cancel that, just pray that I have the good sense to follow his sage advice.<br /><br />Christian Hunter<br /><br />Santa Barbara, Californiae. <br /> <br />Christian Hunter <br />Santa Barbara, California	2005-03-30

I read Persepolis tonight.<br /><br />I mean the whole thing.  I started it after dinner, and just finished it at the 153rd page.  For those of you who've read, or should I say \\"experienced\\" this work, that won't come as a surprise.  For those of you who haven't, consider it a high-endorsement.  I had other plans for my night...<br /><br />..I also had my doubts about this work.  Despite the rave reviews, I've never even read a comic book.  That, coupled with the fact that at first glance, it seemed very...well, childish?<br /><br />Oh the shame!  Marjane Satrapi has created an apologetic convert out of me.<br /><br />Persepolis is the story of one girls experience during the fall of the Shah of Iran, the ensuing Islamic Revolution (which included Stalin like \\"purges\\"), and war with Iraq.  Only it's not told in plain text, but rather is a pictured in a comic book style.<br /><br />A history buff myself, I have an above-average awareness of the historical goings on of that period.  However, told in this unorthodox style, with pictures, through the creative and emotional eyes of a child, the \\"facts\\" gained a vibrance and color for me like never before.  The human side of history had so much more meaning, and seemed to imprint a deeper and easier understanding in my mind than most accounts.<br /><br />When I was thinking about what was so compelling about this book, I thought of Edward Tufte.  He's a famous professor and scientist in the field of displaying information graphically. I went to a seminar by him once.  He passionately explained the concept of neural bandwidth, and how most text and plain graphs don't take advantage of the massive processing power of our minds.  The pictures in Persepolis, coupled with Marjane's rich historical account seemed to take advantage of that latent neural ability.  For me, they compounded and achieved something of an emotional critical mass of understanding that few books have.<br /><br />So, like I said, I'm a convert.

Pulitzer Prize winning author Thomas L Friedman knows the Middle East.  Not just because he's been stationed there as a New York Times Affairs Desk columnist for over a decade, but more because he's one of the most intelligent, thoughtful, and progressive political thinkers of our time.<br /><br />Longitudes and Attitudes is a collection of columns divided up into 3 parts:  Part One consists of pre-9/11 columns, Part 2, post-9/11 columns, and Part 3 his diary of the tumultous times immediately after 9/11.<br /><br />Each column is about 750 words.  Each make a clear and important point (whether you agree with him or not).  And together, they'll give the average reader a massive boost in understanding as it relates to:<br /><br />1.  The Palestinian Isreali confict<br /><br />2.  The moral, social, and philisophical topography of the Middle East, and,<br /><br />3.  Ideas on how to intervene (both nationally and internationally) with the \\"Middle East problem\\"; that is, terrorism, fanaticism, and economic plight.<br /><br />Unorthodox, intelligent, daring, and always interesting, T.

I picked up this book over the summer based on the rave reviews of my amazon colleagues.  I'll admit to being surprised at first, for the cover (which looked modern) distracted me from the fact that this book is over half a century old.   <br /> <br />I'm a contemporary sci-fi fan, I think authors can use modern-day technological topography to look \\"so far out\\".  That's just my thing.  Well, I'm glad I gave this book a chance, because while it's more fantasy than sci-fi, technology took a back seat to the philosophical and sociological impacts of tech.  In this case, a major human evolutionary leap. <br /> <br />Sturgeon describes the origination of a new breed of man.  A man that's not one man, but a combination of parts, each serving a distinct and specialized function.  Most of the book is dedicated to the gestation and organization of this species.  I think I'd be more interested in More Than Human 2...I'd love to see the social, technological, and moral impacts to a world filled with \\"Homo-Gestalts\\" as the author calls them. <br /> <br />That aside, this book is a worthwhile read.  The writing was \\"Hemmingway-like\\" in it's elegant simplicity, yet the environments were vivid, and the characters well-developed. <br /> <br />Enjoy, <br /> <br />Christian Hunter <br />Santa Barbara, California	2005-02-14

The closest thing to a gentlemen I've ever met once told me, \\"Christian, women determine if you're a gentlemen by first looking at your shoes and your watch\\" (I had on Teva knock-off's and my wrist sported only hair, and a mild tan.  He went on to say that a true gentlemen is knowledgeable in fine wines (among other things).<br /><br />That was some number of years ago.  Since then, I totally get the shoe thing, and good watches have become a passion of mine.  Wine however, well, that's another story.<br /><br />Take it as fact that I've spent six figures on wine since determining to \\"appreciate and understand it\\".  Embarrasingly, progress has been slow.  For that reason, I wish I came across this book several years ago.<br /><br />Lawrence Osborne approaches the question of \\"what is fine wine\\" as a relative virgin to the space.  Just as I did, he struggled to understand what all the fuss is about with a Bordeaux, what all those impossible to categorize universe of descriptions for taste mean (are they BS or not...\\"crushed seashells, plum, and asphalt!!?), and who these winemakers behind the labels really are.<br /><br />I think he largely succeeds in this book.  His quest takes him around the world, from purveyors as old as the United States, to upstart \\"garagistes\\" (garage wine makers).  Part expose that'll have winemakers and their customers blush, part validation, this book will have you laughing, and entertained the whole way through.<br /><br />For me, it helped me focus my tastes, and realize where price has truly outpaced quality.  For that, I'm grateful to the author, this book may save me thousands!<br /><br />Enjoy,<br /><br />Christian Hunter<br />Santa Barbara, California	2005-02-01

I read books about health, nutrition, and diet all the time.  In the nearly 150 reviews I've done here, I've never found a single book in any of those genres significant enough to comment on or recommend in a review...until this one.<br /><br />Described as a \\"modern day Benjamin Franklin\\", Ray Kurzweil teamed up with one of the worlds most accomplished authorities in anti-aging.  I use the term accomplished, because while there may be more accredited theorists on anti-aging, few, if any enjoy the success in hands-on application of anti-aging in the consumer space.<br /><br />This book, while extremely detailed, is written simply, and is highly interesting throughout.  Readers will be treated to one of the (if not \\"the\\") most up-to-date and comprehensive 3D views of health maintenence available.  From diet and exercise, to aggressive supplementation, the authors explain in detail how to determine your current state of health, then how to gradually (or radically) modify it to an optimum state.<br /><br />While many diet fads promote the \\"power of X, Y, or Z\\", this book recognizes that there is no one Silver Bullet that'll make you thin/give you energy/make you look younger, etc.  Instead, the prescriptions in this book are balanced and integrated, often showing the important relationships between food, exersize, supplements, and lifestyle.  For example, if you don't get enough nourishment from food (as many diets require), you'll have an energy deficit, and often that'll steal from your ability to maintain a good exersize regime.  Countless other examples exist of those interdependencies, suffice it to say, most all are addressed in this book, and accompanied by guidance for optimization.<br /><br />Always the health enthusiast, at 31, I'm 5'10, 160, haven't been sick in 2 years (ok, fine! I got a mild cold that lasted 3 days, but that's it!), have more energy, and look and feel better than I ever have.  I attribute my health to a near fanatic approach to diet, exercise, and supplementation.  This book validated a number of my approaches, but opened my eyes to some truly significant new understandings.  Since adding some of the recommended diet and supplementation regimes from the book, I look and feel noticably healthier.<br /><br />More a service than a book, ray and terry maintain a support site, along with updated information, referrals to various products they recommend, they even have their own meal replacement shake (sweetened with Stevia, an herbal sweetner) that is hands-down the best in its class.  You can visit the site at rayandterry .com.<br /><br />Here I've gone on and on about the immediate benefits of this book, and neglected to even mention its special charter, and what I view as perhaps the most important aspect of its value: the science behind radical life extension.<br /><br />Kurzweil became interested in Life Extension and wrote \\"The Age of Spiritual Machines\\". Where he predicted that with certain technologies in the future, man could live indefinitely.  I'm no authority in that space, but after reading that book, he convinced me that it is indeed possible.<br /><br />This book represents a \\"bridge\\" of sorts to a time where such technologies exist.  A \\"50 something\\" baby-boomer, Kurzweil, despite being diagnosed with diabetes (and treating himself off medicine), looks every bit the youthful enthusiast this book will very likely make you into.<br /><br />I couldn't recommend it higher.<br /><br />Enjoy,<br /><br />Christian Hunter<br /><br />Santa Barbara, California<br /><br />BTW:  The best product for Vitamin C and some B's is Emergen-C.  I get the Tangerine, and take twice a day.  Also, whenever I start to feel like I could be getting a cold, I get Zicam.  It's a liquid Zinc compound that you put in your nose.  It binds to the same cellular receptors that the Rhinovirus (Rhino, meaning \\"nose\\" in Latin...i think) does.  I'm a psycho evangalist for both products.

A famous Biblical quote, one that resonated with me strongly, and profoundly influenced my thinking on international aid, but more broadly, the problem of poverty, and the reticence of Capitalism in addressing it.<br /><br />I'm a strong believer in capitalism, this wonderful book reinforced my belief in that system.  It did so by showing how world poverty and consistently non-functional economies aren't because of capitalism, but for lack of capitalist attention.<br /><br />Times have changed, technology and it's rapidly increasing efficacy in efficient delivery of products and services, necessitates that we change our attitude about heretofore neglected markets, and the nearly 5 billion people in them.  \\"Inclusive Capitalism\\" as the author calls it.<br /><br />Rich with important concepts like \\"Installment Sales\\" (which address the needs and constraints of low-income consumers), this book is a virtual blueprint for companies, as well as entreprenuers, who are interested in serving low-income consumers around the world.<br /><br />The hardcover book also contains a CD.  I usually skip viewing those, but I'm glad I didn't in this instance.  Prahalad gives the introduction, then roughly a dozen case studies follow.  From Appliance sales companies in Brazil, to a Cement company in Mexico; seeing the passion on the faces of their customers, how the companies have changed their lives, it is incredibly touching.  You aren't watching customers, you're watching \\"evangalists\\" that would make your most devout American iPod fan seem like an unsatisfied customer.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly.<br /><br />Enjoy,<br /><br />Christian Hunter<br /><br />Santa Barbara, California	2005-02-01

This study of compliance (a study of the factors that cause one person to say yes to another person) was among the most fascinating, useful, and, quite frankly, \\"scary\\" books I've ever read.  I've always known that asking for permission has allot to do with \\"how\\" you ask, I just didn't know how much.  This author shows us scientifically \\"how much\\", and it's a disturbing amount.<br /><br />Clearly, the workings of the mind are a mysterious and universally interesting science; from how it operates the way it does, to why, it's when science can tell us how to operate the mind \\"remotely\\" that things get very, very interesting. Robert Cialdini, in this extensive study, shows us how various practitioners of compliance (from salespeople, to fund-raisers and advertisers) deliberately use what tools they have (for good or evil) to increase their chances of getting us to comply with their will.<br /><br />The author breaks down the basic means by which to obtain compliance into 6 different categories: reciprocity, commitment/consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity.  In each section you'll find a wealth of well researched, sometimes funny, always interesting, facts and experiments that show how our basic instincts, societal conditioning, and even our physiology, respond to basic permission requests.  I was repeatedly shocked to learn just how automatic many of those responses were.<br /><br />From a study that shows how many people associate \\"expensive\\" with value. In the first chapter of the book the author give an example of a jeweler who accidentally doubled instead of halved the price of some jewelry they had that was not selling well. After a leaving the shop for a short time, to the jewelers surprise, the accidentally marked up items had all been sold.<br /><br />Or how about a study that demonstrates that people are more likely to agree to a request if a reason is given.  One proof had a group simply ask if they could cut in line, another group asked to cut in line and then gave a ridiculous reason.  The latter group enjoyed something like a 3X success rate.  Simply adding a \\"becuase\\" enhanced the chances of success geometrically.<br /><br />The \\"contrast principal\\" gives an example from the retail world where Salespeople are often instructed to sell the most expensive items first. Having paid a lot for a suit, for example, most people will pay more for shirts and ties than if they started with those relatively inexpensive items first. Car salesmen will sell the car first, then load you up on the optional extras.<br /><br />There are dozens and dozens of additional examples; details on the efficacy of \\"walking someone down in price\\", to why giving dirt cheap gifts make airport Krisha's so successful in their pitches.  I'd love to include more, but can't for lack of time.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, this book will give you a very interesting and valuable education on the art of gaining permission, as well as some useful tools in defending yourself from others battling to gain yours.<br /><br />Enjoy,<br /><br />Christian Hunter<br /><br />Santa Barbara, Californiaroup asked to cut in line and then gave a ridiculous reason.

Hardy and Jason Clarke have helped set in motion what I predict will be the ultimate downfall of M. Moore.<br /><br />Half of those reading this will cheer, the other half are certainly jeering...\\"Red Blue difference right\\"?  Let's hope not.  It's to the latter group (and those on the fence) I'll address this review.<br /><br />This book, while certainly biased against Moore, appeals to human reason and our natural allergy to hypocrisy, deceit, and slander in opening up vectors to attack Moore.  The basic assumptions it attacks are summarized in this widely-held belief: \\"Michael Moore is a documentarian activist, he exposes corruption, greed, thievery, and power-systems that have gone awry (be they business or government) on film\\".<br /><br />This book proves in inarguable and exhaustive detail how untrue that basic assumption about the man is.  In fact, this expose brings to light the irony in that assumption by proving in fact that:  Michael Moore is an ultra-capitalist filmmaker who would (and has) go to any length to create successful movies.<br /><br />That's more than mere hyperbole, consider the following:<br /><br />Moore was born and raised in the white \\"bedroom town\\" of Davison, MI, NOT the poor and disenfranchised Flint, MI. where unemployment (at 4.6%) is 1/3rd that of it's urban neighbor, and, incedentally, less than one half of one percent of Davison is African American.  He's hardly the \\"boy from the hood\\" as he so often purports to be.<br /><br />In Bowling for Columbine Moore villified Charlton Heston, insinuating that immediately after the Columbine massacre, the NRA held a rally in nearby Denver.  Absolutely false. In fact, it was an annual meeting, and according to the bylaws of the organization, was too late to cancel.  However, what he does neglect to mention, is that the entire meeting was gutted of all festivities.  Only the necessary business of the NRA was tended to.<br /><br />In addition, the speech Charleton Heston delivered in B. for C. was grafted from a speech delivered pre-Columbine!  When viewing B. for C., it's impossible not to be outraged at the audacity of Heston when he energetically starts in with \\"...from my cold, dead, hands\\" - well, in fact, this speech was delivered after being presented an award at an NRA function in North Carolina!<br /><br />Ugh, I'm sitting here with the book, and just now realizing it would take me an entire night to cover at least the basics of what makes Moore such a repugnant character.

Pardon the weak analogy, it's 2am in the morning, I just realized I'm out of Malt Balls, and, well, I might have women somewhere on my 30 year old mind.<br /><br />Anyway.  As evidenced in my rating of this book, despite its shortcomings (which I'll address shortly), this book is remarkable in so many ways by contrast with comparable books of its genre that it would be unfair to award it with anything less than 5 stars.<br /><br />So, trolling for cool Sci-Fi du jour I happened upon this well regarded book, ordered it, looked it over superficially, then retired it to the bookshelf.  I'm so glad that it found its way back into my reading circulation.  From the first handful of pages I was hooked...and I don't hook easily.  Jensen's use of creative and elegant prose to narrate the very different, very interesting lives of this books handful of characters had me turning the pages in ever increasing sessions.<br /><br />At the highest level, and not giving anything material away, this story is about a technology that can manipulate the basic laws that govern our material AND \\"spiritual\\" universe.  Ambitious?  Very, but the author does an admirable job building an epistemological foundation that includes cutting-edge technology, relevant history, and in-depth philosophy.  Combined, and against the backdrop of \\"what's going to happen if this tech falls in the wrong hands\\", you've got real nail-biting potential.  And this book realizes allot of it; that is, for the first 2/3rds of the read.

That's not to say finishing it was a mistake, but more to say, I don't know what exactly compelled me about this novel.  I, perhaps like some, maybe like most, read for any number of reasons: I read to learn, to be intrigued, to have my perceptions challenged, to be made to laugh...often a book specializes around one of those values.<br /><br />Sideways fit outside my bevy of good reasons to read a book, but had pull nonetheless.  I was drawn to it (I'm sure like most) because Fox Searchlight optioned it for a movie and Alexander Payne is directing it.  I figured I'd give it 20 pages and see if it hooked.<br /><br />And that it did.<br /><br />This book is an incredibly easy read, it's characters are simple, highly believable, largely broken, and undeniably interesting to follow.  This was like reading a Jerry Springer show about the inadvisable combination of male pre-marriage jitters, copious amounts of fine wine, and bachelor parties that last more than a weekend...literary rubbernecking.<br /><br />I often give friends grief when I see a copy of \\"Devil Wears Prada\\" or something comparable in their hands.  I dismiss it as \\"Chick Lit\\" and remind them of all the classics they're ignoring.  Well, I'm now guilty of doing same.  For a week or so I sported the male equivalent of Chick Lit..D**k Lit (I'd like credit if that term ever goes mainstream), and I don't regret it a bit.<br /><br />Fun, easy, interesting.

I abstained from writing reviews on any volumes of this trilogy until and unless I finished them all.  I just recently completed the final volume of The Golden Age Trilogy, and am happy to report that each book is a wonderful read in its own right.<br /><br />For me, the first was a mind-bending introduction into a world so strange, so fascinating, it took an entire volume to get me comfortable with the basic attributes of the environment.  This book, the second volume in the trilogy was a real treat to read.  I was already comfortable with the \\"user interface\\" of GA, and the plot unfolded with less strain.  The third book, Golden Transcendence is the most remarkable of them all.<br /><br />But back to Phoenix Exultant.  I won't spoil any of the developments this book offers (warning: some reviews below do), and it's difficult (having read all 3) to parse out what is now a blended understanding, but some general impressions:<br /><br />This was a much more exciting read than the first book.  Phaethons transition from immortal to mortal, his struggle for survival, and the effects such turmoil had on his basic belief system was at times mindblowing.  The effects environment has in changing or reinforcing a mans basic virtue is always interesting, but when that man is thousands of years old, well, infinitely more so.<br /><br />It was also intriguing to explore the basic history, tendencies, and roles each major character (and neuroform) play in this colorful and highly detailed future.  In particular, the relationship between Daphne (Phaethons wife), their present, and VERY interesting past.<br /><br />If you're like me, you'll sail through this book and enjoy every minute of it.  Trust that as good as the first two volumes are, John Wright saved the best for last.<br /><br />Enjoy<br /><br />Christian Hunter<br /><br />Santa Barbara, California	2004-08-10

I also use it to describe the author; because while the main character is a freak in his own right, he's one of an entirely different caliber.<br /><br />A Wild Sheep Chase takes us to Tokyo Japan 'round 1980 and dumps us into the sharp but entirely unexercised, and increasingly apathetic mind of our 30 year old (male) main character.  Funny, I just checked the book because I couldn't remember his name.  I couldn't find it.  I may be wrong, but I don't know if the author gives him one.<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />Newly divorced, incessantly smoking, and always musing in very interesting ways about largely uninteresting things, I found myself pulled into this novel immediately.  \\"We\\" soon find ourselves embroiled in an epic and supernatural mystery with only a half-tank of gas.  When tasked by an uber-powerful businessman to find a certain certain one-of-a-kind sheep or face financial ruin (if not death), our adventurer shruggingly agrees, and half-heartedly pursues.<br /><br />The slurring pace of this book, filled with philosophical musings, \\"David Lynch like\\" weirdos, and a spattering of phenomenon, was a rare treat for me.<br /><br />Murakami is a wonderfully gifted creative writer.  His prose (even though translated) is at once elegantly crafted and playful.  I recommend this book highly.<br /><br />Christian Hunter<br /><br />Santa Barbara, California	2004-08-10

Ok, so there are a few things I'd like to get straight with you right off the bat...<br />1:  I just got back from a semi-romantic dinner with my 24 year old ex...stunningly beautiful, tall, Mexican...an absolute angel.  Anyway, all to say I needed a few drinks to help reconcile why she's my ex, so, technically, I'm drunk.<br />2:  I've been agonizing over how to write a review about a trilogy so important to me, so life changing, that in all my determined creative ability, I've failed to find proper words for.<br />Allright then, now that I've set the contextual table for my mindset in writing this review...<br />Hmmm...three 400 something paged books, that's quite an investment for even the most voracious reader.  Me, I almost abandoned this series in Shanghai China (where I brought it to serve as a semi-cerebral distraction from the dark melee that is Shanghai to a well-to-do 30 year old).  Anyway, about 50 pages into this first book I almost dropped it.  Although fascinated by the bigness of its scope (10,000 years into the future, insanely well-thought-through...it just wasn't hooking me right).  I put it down for a couple of months, but found myself talking to friends about what I had read.  For instance, I would share how (that far into the future) characters took the potential for miscommunication so seriously that it would take a page or so to issue a simple salutory greeting (of course!  strange, but that's just right!)  So, while it didn't grip me from the start, its unique style, complexity, and substance stayed with me.  I decided to give it another chance.<br />I'm so thankful I did.<br />At around 80-100 pages I was consumed in this strange but believable world of the future, set so far ahead of any reasonable predictatory event horizon most mere mortal authors would attempt.  John Wright pulls it off in a way that is sure to earn him a place at the table of some of the best sci-fi writers of all time.  Delicious prose gives life to a story so well detailed, characters so solid and dynamic, it wouldn't surprise me if there exists whole books he wrote just to make sure there weren't inconsistencies.<br />Damnit, I'm getting off the subject.  Here is the essence of what I'd like to communicate.  Having waited until finishing this trilogy before writing this review I can say this:<br />The first book (The Golden Age) is fascinating, well-written, and rife with mind-numbing concepts detailing the wildly fantastic potential of humanity that far off in the future.<br />But that's not why you should read The Golden Age.<br />You see (and this is where I'm really going out on an assumptive limb) I believe the author constructed the entire series to make one life changing point; a point made in one paragraph of the second to last page of the trilogy...the most important advice I've ever read or heard in my life.<br />I've told this to friends, and in each instance tendered this warning (because I could see what they planned to do):  &quot;It won't make sense to you unless you read the books&quot;.<br />And I mean it.<br />Unfortunately, as rational beings we need basis to believe anything; important understandings require substantial basis.  That's what this trilogy is about.  Other than being enormously entertaining, it builds 1500 pages worth of basis in making a simple, elegant, and enormously important statement.<br />It's now 2 in the morning, I'm exhausted (but newly sober).  I hope that this review stimulates sufficient interest to compel you to pick up this first book, read 80 pages, and see if you yourself aren't seduced.

US	45381038	R3805M1RJI07B1	0471423270	938357392	Bush's Brain: How Karl Rove Made George W. Bush Presidential	Books	3	21	25	N	N	Interesting, enjoyable, but unsatisfying.	I leapt at the opportunity to read anything about the elusive and enigmatic Karl Rove.  This man, like some political &quot;Where's Waldo&quot;, is stitched into virtually every political scenario involving President Bush.  I was curious about who this big nerdy looking dude was, how he got on the scene, and what he might want.  The latter curiosity was perhaps my strongest.  I wanted to know why the Campaign Consultant didn't go home after the election.<br />This book did a fairly good job of satisfying most of these curiosities.  I now know about Karl Rove as a kid, Karl Rove as the know-it-all student, Karl Rove as the guerilla campaign consultant, and Karl Rove as the first ever &quot;permanent consultant&quot;; which is a unique (if not scary) position.  It seems that Bush decided it would be a good idea to keep someone in the White House full-time to help him ascertain how certain policy decisions would likely play with the electorate.<br />Unfortunately, and most likely because of the unprecedented secrecy of this administration, that's really where &quot;trail ends&quot;.  The author doesn't offer much as to what Rove has been doing the last four years.  I found that disappointing.  Also, I found way to much &quot;kenstaresque&quot; witchhunting going on - he said/janitor said style accusations about impropriety in some of the campaigning he was involved in.  Nothing juicy.<br />I would recommend this book for those who have an insatiable appetite to know everything publicly available about the Bush Administration.  Even in that case, I'd recommend skimming through this book vs. reading carefully.  I read carefully, and there just wasn't enough there there.<br />Christian Hunter<br />Santa Barbara, California	2004-07-13

This book is an exhilarating glimpse into the future of technology, with an emphasis on when and how it could ultimately affect us: &quot;us&quot; as vulnerable injury prone biology, us as students, us as workers, us as socialites, and perhaps most interestingly, us as mortals.<br />Hard science in plain terms, Kurzweil stitches in humor and optimism to keep the reading fun, but never sacrifices the basic ambition of this book; I believe that ambition is to share his well-founded exitement about the likilihood that &quot;just around the corner&quot; (owing to the laws of accelerating return) things are going to get real interesting, and really strange.<br />While I note that plenty of reviews take issue with the pace of change Kurzweil predicts, few dispute the likilihood technologies outlined in the book (Nanotechnological production, AI, man-made/machine-made alternatives to biology such as prosthetics that work as well or better than nature designed) will ever come about, or take issue with the myriad ways in which they will have a profound effect on our individual lives, society, and the world at large.<br />Kurzweil is an optimist, but not a blind one.  He was the principal developer of the first omni-font optical character recognition, the first print-to-speech reading machine for the blind, the first CCD flat-bed scanner, the first text-to-speech synthesizer, the first music synthesizer capable of recreating the grand piano and other orchestral instruments, and the first commercially marketed large-vocabulary speech recognition.  Many of his tech-prophecies have come true, and he has well earned respect in the scientific community.<br />Even if he's somewhat &quot;off&quot; on timing, or the exact embodiment these technologies will take, just throwing one of your neural legs over the sweeping impact these technologies could usher in makes this book more than a worthwhile read.<br />Christian Hunter<br />Santa Barbara, California	2004-07-13

It made connections between books that people polled read in common.  Liberals were in blue, Conservatives in red.  It looked like 2 spider webs.  Liberals read one set of books (Bushwacked, etc.) and Conservatives (Deliver us from Evil, etc.).  A sad paradigm considering the need for national and international unity.<br />I found no clear bias in this book.  Kagan doesn't set up Europeans as useless gun-dropping appeasement junkies, or Americans as dangerous gun-loving cowboys; rather, he uses history and philosophical conditioning (Hobbesian vs. Kantian) to assist the reader in - if not empathising with both sides - at least understanding the unique circumstances of each side, and the consequential positions they've taken on important world events of late (mostly related to security).<br />This essay taught me more than most books do, and I didn't feel like I had to keep my \\"partisan bull**** filter\\" running on high (makes reading much more enjoyable).<br />I recommend this highly.<br />Christian Hunter	2004-07-07

I, like so many others, was saddened by the death of Ronald Reagan just a handful of days ago.  Innundated by coverage as we have been lately, one strip of video had a particularly strong affect on me: it was the video of Nancy Reagan stroking the flag that lay over her late husbands coffin.  Her hands moved back and forth over it almost as if she were trying to pat out wrinkles from a perfectly pressed flag; and she was speaking to her husband, moving her mouth uttering words unaudible to the public.<br />My eyes welled instantaneously.<br />I immediately remembered why that scene affected me as it did.  I remembered reading the letters written by Ronald, saved by Nancy, organized and published in this wonderfully interesting and telling book.  I remembered how deeply in love the two were with each other, and how utterly devastating it must be for her to lose such a great husband...such a great friend.<br />If my memory serves me correctly, Reagan held some high position in the acting biz (perhaps it was the Screen Actors Guild), and was introduced to Nancy by a mutual friend (she wanted to be an actress, and I think had done some work...it was some time ago that I read this, so please forgive any inaccuracies), anyway, they hit it off immediately, as is so often the case in relationships of great quality.  Almost immediately (like a modern day relationship might start trading e-mails) they began to trade letters.  She saved them all, and published them chronologically in this book.<br />He soon after took a job with GE as a corporate spokesperson and was shuttled around the country to speak on the company's behalf (despite his great fear of flying).  It was during his time on the road that he really grew comfortable trusting Nancy with his innermost thoughts.  And private they are!  She was a friend, a lover, a mother (of both him and their children), priest, and parishioner.<br />I was struck by the eloquence in Reagan's writing.  His often labeled &quot;The Great Communicator&quot;, well, that holds true not just in his ability to give great speaches, he's an equally adept writer.  Some of his letters are so tender, passionate, and well composed that it reads more like poetry than a simple letter.<br />I recommend this book to any who would like a deeper, more intimate understanding of who R.

Maybe ever...	...It would be difficult for me to overstate my appreciation and respect for Broken Angels; the second in what will be a series of novels about Takeshi Kovacs, the semi-immortal antihero who is as animated and complex as the mind-numbingly interesting times he operates in.<br />Not since (Neal Stephenson's) Snowcrash has my thirsty sci-fi craving mind been deluged with so many fantastically interesting technology spawned drama.  From &quot;cortical stacks&quot; (devices that sit at the base of the brain stem and record the exact neural map of their host serving as a de-facto redundant brain) to &quot;re-sleeving&quot; (the process of transferring the stack to a new body); from &quot;hypercasting&quot; (speed of light transmission of consciousness from on point to another for re-sleeving) to the &quot;virtuals&quot; (AI governed simulations that serve every purpose, from entertainment to torture and interrogation - all at a subjective speed of their choice...5 minutes could equal 1 year, 100 years could equal 5 minutes...not fun when someone who wants the truth out of you decides to use fire and pliers at 1,000,000X slower than real-time).<br />At this day in age it's difficult for an author to spawn un-heard-of concepts, however, Richard K. Morgan gives life to theoretical possibility and stitches it into thrilling drama as good as any author today.  Consider this is his second (after Altered Carbon) published book; we have reason to celebrate the arrival of a major force in the Sci-Fi scene.  There is no doubt in my mind that this (still relatively obscure) author will be popularly regarded as one of the best in the genre in coming years.<br />So, with that glowing preface, a bit about the book.  I guess there are two principle ways I could consider its value...first, in contrast to his first work, Altered Carbon; second, to other contemporary Sci-Fi.<br />To the first, in contrast with Altered Carbon, a book I regarded at reading as the best since Snowcrash, I consider Broken Angels a better work.  In my opinion, Morgan's creative capacity for description has matured (from extraordinary to brilliant).  As an amatuer writer, voracious reader, and semi-experienced reviewer, it's none to common to find an author in this genre that can combine high-minded scientific concepts with delicious prose.<br />Altered Carbon had Takeshi Kovacs serving as a mercenary detective working for a &quot;victim&quot; of a suicide that (when revived) couldn't buy the explanation of the police as to the motive of his suicide.  A brilliant and fantastic work.  Broken Angels centers Takeshi in a much broader and complex environment.  Acting as a warrior-for-hire in a massive struggle to put down a planetary revolt, Takeshi is pulled into even higher drama when he is coerced into a close-knit consipiracy to lay claim to an ancient (Martian) spacecraft; the archeological find of several lifetimes.<br />In terms of how this novel matches up to others, as indicated at the start of this review, not since Stephenson has an author been able to &quot;put so many conceptual balls in the air&quot; and still maintain a cohesive, entertaining, and rich reading experience.<br />Without giving much away, the sophistication and abundance of Takeshi's adversaries; from hyper-evolving nanotech weapons, nuke-lobbing Rebel forces, Interplanetary governments, and even his own crew; keep you turning the pages like you've been poisoned and the next page has the antidote...However, it's not just carnage, quite the opposite, Broken Angels is rich in social commentary and philosophical perspective.  From the effects of semi-immortality on individual perspective to this novels exploration of &quot;Martian culture&quot; and the mysterious evidence of alien civilization left behind, ideas and fascinating considerations abound...<br />So much FUN!<br />I deliberately saved this review until my 100th for amazon.  Call me sentimental, but this book is such a treasure to me.<br />If you haven't read Altered Carbon, I'd recommend reading that first.  I don't consider that necessary, but I do believe reading AC and being exposed to allot of the jargon and technical terms of the series will permit a richer experience in Broken Angels.<br />Anyway, I hope this review was helpful.<br />Enjoy.r />If you haven't read Altered Carbon, I'd recommend reading that first.

Before ordering, I spent some time at his site (of same name as the book) and was impressed enough to do what the site pushes you to do: order the book...<br />I was mildly dissapointed.  While the book has plenty of interesting factoids, from the beginning it felt way overwritten.  Almost like the author had a 24 page lesson plan and decided to stretch it out to 240 pages.  In my opinion, there is allot of &quot;fluff&quot;.  Granted, some may be interested in reading 20 pages about the fact that emotions are nature (vs. nurture) across all cultures...well, that was hotly debated 20 years ago, now it's generally accepted as fact...move on.<br />The meat of my issue with the book is that it should have been a lesson plan.  My favorite part of the book is at the end when there are 14 pages of faces with barely registered emotion on them that you have to discern the meaning in.  I wanted that throughout the book.<br />If you have a particular fascination with this subject, I'd recommend ordering the CD's and using the interactive lesson plan.  Skip the book.<br />Hope this was helpful.	2004-04-28
US	45381038	R80IRHQ9QHMF	0553372300	671551230	Interface	Books	3	0	3	N	N	Conspiracy lovers take notice!	I just read &quot;Bush's Brain: How Karl Rove Made George W. Bush Presidential&quot; (by James More and Wayne Slater); the entire time I was thinking &quot;man, this is just like that book I once read called &quot;Interface&quot; (minus the neuralsynaptic interface of course; or I should say, &quot;I hope&quot;).<br />I'm seriously thinking of sending this book to Karl Rove.  As the man in charge of manipulating public opinion in favor of Bush, at the bare minimum I think he'd really get a kick out of this book.  I'm sure he'd salivate at the prospect of being able to control Bush directly vs. having to laugh at all his jokes and hang out at family BBQ's.<br />For those who haven't read Interface, I would advise you to avoid unless you meet one of two tests:<br />1.  You're a psycho maniac for Neal Stephenson (which I was, and remained after this book and up until I read Quicksilver).  He co-authored this with his uncle.<br />2.  You're holed up on a deserted island with two things: a printed version of this book, and for some reason, a printed version of this review for guidance.<br />The writing is mediocre, the storyline is relatively interesting (although a bit un-realistic)...evil guys create a neural interface that they use to stream public opinion input in real-time (instead of benefitting society and making a ton of money in the process)...um.<br />That's really just about it.  No noteworthy twists and a relatively predictable outcome.	2004-04-27

The US wisely leveraged the extraordinary (cult-like) capital in servitude that the Emperor had built up in the war ravaged empire.  Using what was dubbed the &quot;Wedge Strategy&quot; the US seperated the Emperor from the rest of the Japanese Imperial Government, attributing blame for all the evils of the empire that caused devastation and failure to &quot;the Government that betrayed the Emperor, and the people of Japan&quot;.  The US then proceeded to use the Emperor as a proxy to the public; asserting his preserved authority to conform the Japanese to the basic charter of the Potsdam Declaration and, more significantly, to McCarther (as &quot;Supreme Commander&quot;; jeez, that was actually his title, imagine if Bremer was assigned such a title, times have certainly changed).<br />From a detailed accounting of the extraordinary devastation to Japan (their economy, their population, their identities), through the mechanics of the occupation, the writing of a constitution (both literally and philosophically) and through the final stages of engineering, this book (at over 500 pages) is chock full of fascinating understandings of one of the greatest undertakings in history; the reconstitution and habilitation of a defeated nation by the nation that defeated it.<br />This is a fascinating read that is well organized.  That it's well organized is worth noting, for as long a read as it is, the casual reader can (from the Table of Contents) skip around the book, read certain chapters of interest, and never feel lost.<br />I hope this was helpful.on to Japan (their economy, their population, their identities), through the mechanics of the occupation, the writing of a constitution (both literally and philosophically) and through the final stages of engineering, this book (at over 500 pages) is chock full of fascinating understandings of one of the greatest undertakings in history; the reconstitution and habilitation of a defeated nation by the nation that defeated it.<br />This is a fascinating read that is well organized.

Admittedly at the time of read I would have given the book 3.5 to 4 stars.  Lacking in my opinion was a coherent storyline; the book was convoluted, you never knew what the point really was.<br />However, this novel has left a lasting impression on me.  Of the numerous &quot;takeaways&quot;, the most enduring are these:<br />1.  Nanotechnology will change everything (not so apparent to the public now, much less back in 97).<br />2.  Technology of this magnitude could offer the key to &quot;leveling the playing field&quot; with respect to economic inequity.<br />3.  I devised a business term as a consequence of reading this book that has helped me immeasurably in my career: &quot;attention units&quot;.  In the future Stephenson posits that marketing will be so efficient that virtually every piece of visual real estate will be covered with what he calls &quot;mediaglyphs&quot;; billboards with audio and video (even on chopsticks).  Not saying that I think that's a future I'd like to help build, but it does give you greater appreciation for any venue that could garner consumer attention.<br />And finally, my greatest lesson of all was what the Primer (the supercomputer/teacher designed by the futures equivelant to a Bill Gates for his grandaughter in an effort to stave off the near inevitable corruption of his heirs owing to great fortune); the Primer's number one lesson in all of it's teaching was appreciation and capability in one principal skill; subversion.  It taught her how to go &quot;around, under, over&quot; any obstacle with unorthodox, even risky thinking.<br />Cool stuff.<br />Anyway, didn't give anything away of great substance there, but did want to give you a few more reasons from my perspective to read this very special book.<br />Hope this was helpful.	2004-04-20

This book is one of two things to everyone:<br />1.  a lifechanging read.<br />2.  an ego boost.<br />For those in the first group, they'll identify a deficit in at least a couple of what the author calls &quot;7 critical principals&quot; which served as the principal enablers of Da'Vinci's genius (Curiosita, Dimonstratzione, Sensazione, Sfumato, Arte/Scienza, Corporalita, Connessione).<br />However, most of those that have the drive to purchase (and actually read) a book like this very likely embody (in some way) most of those seven tenets.  This group is going to race through this book (I read in one night, lol, ultimate arrogance....whatev.) and feel pretty good about themselves.<br />I'd recommend circling back through those principals that you might be underdeveloped in.  That's where this book was most valuable to me (other than the better working understanding of who this great man was and some of the very cool and diverse stuff he did), it helped me realize that I need to continually work to balance my interests (not so easy to do in this world of hyper-specialization).<br />I think this to be a fun and worthwhile read for everyone and highly recommend.	2004-04-20

This fun collection of essays, just like food ought to be, are served in small portions that satisfy but leave you hungry for more.  Each story has info-nutritional value marinated in over 30 years of experience as a culinary journalist, and are smothered in rich, often spicy storytelling sauce.  Robb Walshs' book &quot;Are You Really Going To Eat That&quot; reminds us that food isn't just a life sustaining resource, but an art that many spend their entire lives devoted to, obsessing over, and perfecting (often by their own proud admission) &quot;in some small way&quot;.<br />In forty stories Robb marches up 4,200 feet to a secluded notch of Jamaica's Blue Mountains to score &quot;the ultimate cup of coffee&quot;, visits Chanthaburi Thailand to gag over Durian fruit - a highly desirable fruit in Southeast Asia which is an extremely odorous (smells like rotten eggs so bad that some hotels there have &quot;no durian&quot; policies).  Or going to prison for dinner, where a legendary black southern prison cook (and 10 time convict) prepares him a chicken fried hamburger, gravy smothered french fries, and broccoli in cheese sauce.<br />Each colorful story makes me hungry (even when the culinary subject is more &quot;adventure&quot; than pleasure), and reinforces a commitment in me to perhaps the most important aspect in our relationship to food....expirimentation.  I doubt I'll ever have half the passion this man does for food; it's more than that to him, it's like a language he uses to translate the meaning of various cultures and their people, who often give more spice to their creation than the ingredients do.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone that eats for anything more than pure survival.	2004-03-08

I picked this book up because I'm an futurist info-junkie.  My expectations were modest, the reviews for this were good, but not stellar.  However, after just a handful of pages I was completely hooked (I read this book in a night, a very long, very late night).<br />Damien Brodericks' book &quot;The Spike&quot; screams for our immediate attention to an impending convergence of a handful of rapidly developing technologies (principally nanotechnology, biotechnology, networking, and Artificial Intelligence), each revolutionary on their own, but combined, transcendental; Broderick calls that convergence &quot;the spike&quot;.<br />The concept alone is worth the read.  Seldom do most people consider just where humanity now stands in relation to technology and its utility.  Where, for example, transportation technology for all but a few thousand years of almost 3 million was our feet and crude &quot;shoes&quot; that permitted 3 mile per hour travel, then animals, chariots, etc. up until about two hundred years ago where a train could propel people at 20 miles per hour, then, &quot;within living memory of the elderly&quot;, cars enabled ever faster travel, then planes, jets, rockets, now technologies allow for video conferencing at light speed.  Broderick points out that if you put that progress on a chart, and drew out just the last 300,000 years of mankinds progress in transport speed increases, you'd see a flat line until you get to the furthest edge of the graph, then a near vertical spike.<br />Cool stuff.<br />And much cooler when you consider that (in his well reasoned belief) if you were to draw out a graph starting 100 years ago, and ending one hundred years from now, we'd find ourselves right at the very beginnings of an incline into a technological spike that will (barring some catostrophic event) fundamentally re-landscape humans (and what it means to be human) in such a material way, you could argue that we wouldn't really remain human at all...<br />This is very approachable science, Broderick, unlike many other writers attempting to translate the almost imponderable and ever increasing torrent of science from the frontier, does allot of digesting for us in this book.  So, while a Matt Ridley (author of &quot;Genome&quot; and &quot;Nature Via Nurture&quot; among others) might be more inclined to try and fill in more factual basis to cement understanding of a particular science, Broderick casts a justifiably wide net over a whole constellation of different scientific disciplines; and, as a consequence, doesn't go into great detail in giving a full &quot;3D&quot; view of each very interesting technology.  This will no-doubt leave some more scientific-minded readers wanting for more in the &quot;basis department&quot;.  For that class, I'd suggest Ridley, but also writers like Hans Moravec (writer of &quot;Robot&quot;), or Ray Kurzweil, author of &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot;.<br />&quot;The Spike&quot; offers optimistic and intensly interesting scenarios for the prospect of a better life in the future as well as realistic concerns that we should start to seriously think about.  At a time where it seems we are constantly bombarded by nay-saying &quot;gloom and doom&quot; forecasts for the future, this book is a refreshing (but not overly optimistic) glimpse into a future so potentially wild, so potentially different, it seems more like Science Fiction.<br />Hope this was helpful.s very approachable science, Broderick, unlike many other writers attempting to translate the almost imponderable and ever increasing torrent of science from the frontier, does allot of digesting for us in this book.

I started Johnson's \\"The Sorrows of Empire\\" with an open mind.  I was interested in learning what this Professor Emeritus at UCSD and famous author of \\"Blowback\\" had to say now (post-9/11) about the America's new tack with respect to its attempts in securing itself from future similar or more devastating incursions.<br />The author immediately went to work in closing my mind.  Within the first handful of pages he used words like \\"cronies\\" to describe Bush and his administration.  C'mon, at least have the patience to build a case against your target before calling names...<br />I read on however, and Johnson continued to reinforce my mistrust of his agenda.  This book is not an objective analysis of the policies of this and former administrations with respect to Military and Economic Diplomacy; it's an propaganda filled, one sided indictment of all those in government that believe \\"the best defense is a good offense\\".<br />You may not agree with that approach, I may not agree; and that could be one reason for my reading this book in the first place.  But this book didn't do anything material to influence my thinking.  As a prerequisite to changing anyone's mind, one must show significant and objectively quantifiable evidence of error.  That doesn't mean just calling out seemingly erroneous policy, it means doing that AND contrasting it with a better alternative.  Johnson has failed to do that on a holistic level.  For instance, on page 256, in one paragraph, he writes:<br />\\"George W. Bush, by contrast [with Bill Clinton], turned to a frontal assault based on the use of America's unequaled military power.  Even before 9/11, the Bush administration had unveiled its unilateral approach to the world.  It withdrew from important international treaties, including those seeking to ban antiballistic missile weapons, control the emission of greenhouse gases, and create a court to try perpetrators of the most heinous war crimes.  Bush also proclaimed openly his adherence to a doctrine of preventative war.  The United States said it was a New Rome, beyond good and evil and unrestrained by the established conventions of the international community....\\"<br />The US said it was a \\"New Rome\\"?!<br />This is criminally propagandist and seditious, but emblematic of his style throughout the book.  He makes a claim with some truth in it like the US's withdrawal from the Kyoto Accord (designed to reduce greenhouse gasses), but makes no mention of why; what the logic might have been behind these seemingly devilish decisions (in this case, it was because 1 of the worlds biggest polluting nations weren't going to sign on).  Whether you would sympathise with this administration knowing those facts or not is one thing.  I take issue with them not being presented at all!<br />There was however at least one redeeming aspect of this book.  Johnson clearly points out extraordinary bureaucracy and waste that exists in America's system of military bases internationally.  With almost 1,000 \\"resort-like\\" bases spanning the globe, Johnson raises important questions about their necessity and their affect (often negative) on the environments they inhabit.  Ironically, it's D. Rumsfeld (not Clintons Bill Cohen) that's done more to attack the military bureaucracy than any other Defense Secretary in recent history.  The cancellation of major weapons programs, and streamlining of America's defense force count as important steps to counter a bloated system.<br />This book is perfect for those who's minds are shut, and are looking to add a handful of \\"floating factoids\\" to their arsenal of Bush hating, anti-globalization, anti-war arsenal.  For those looking to temper or reinforce their views on same, steer clear of this propaganda, there are better books out there for that, like:<br />The Lexus and the Olive Tree, by Thomas L.

I picked up this book just based on its title (a highly inadvisable practice), which was the first of many dissapointments I had with this book.  First off, &quot;Redesigning Humans, Our Inevitable Genetic Future&quot; would be more appropriately named &quot;Redesigning Our Children, Humanities Inevitable Genetic Future&quot;.  You see, this book isn't really about redesigning &quot;us&quot;, it's about a technological process called &quot;germline engineering&quot;.  This technology intervenes with &quot;germ cells&quot; (like sperm and egg) to alter their blueprint (from which our biology originates).<br />Granted, germline engineering is interesting, and I think the author makes a good case for its &quot;inevitability&quot;, but in my humble opinion if you're broadly interested in how science will one day alter mankind's basic physical makeup, or specifically interested in how science will alter our biology, there far more interesting reads than this one.<br />Which brings me to the meat of my point...I'm not arguing Gregory Stocks credentials, and clearly he's a very well educated, well researched scientist (Director of the Medicine, Technology, and Society program at UCLA), but from the outset of this book, he seemed way too biased towards germline engineering, and almost arrogant about germlines superiority as an agent of future change vs. other interesting technology vectors.  On page 20 he summarily dismisses an entire scientific school of thought centered around machine augmentation of biology and capability (headed by such credentialed scientists as R. Kurzweil) with the following statement:<br />&quot;People may dream of enhancing their minds by embedding chips in their brains, but a sophisticated interface between our nervous systems and silicon would be incredibly complex&quot;<br />...Duh!  Augmenting mankind's basic physical essence (that we've had for hundreds of thousands of years) isn't childs play for any scientific approach.  But that was pretty much his &quot;that's that on that&quot; basis.  VERY FRUSTRATING inadequacy to someone who believes the contrary (I'd at least like someone to offer better basis in approach than that).<br />And in considering the benefits of machine or biological augmentation of capability (sensory or performance related) he writes:<br />&quot;Indeed, I cannot imagine any apparatus that would serve us better than our own healthy heart, which responds so perfectly to our changing activity and emotions and is so well matched to the capacities of the rest of our circulatory system.  A healthy human heart represents the ideal to which any replacement must aspire...&quot;<br />What about 10X durability, what about real-time diagnostic feedback, or predictive capability?  That's just off the top of my head!  It's a bit ironic that this kind of narrow mindedness is coming from such a proponent of change...<br />Ok, so setting aside my problems with the book, I did find a number of interesting new understandings.  In particular, this book gave me a firmer grasp of the extraordinary and near-term potential to modify our offspring, it solidified my position on human cloning (as a benign diversion from the real important decisions we as a species will need to face), and reinvigorated my interest in &quot;somatic therapy&quot; (the altering of existent biology with gene-loaded viral pathogens).<br />If you're a physco for this kind of stuff, read the first 80 pages of this book, and skim through the rest.  If you're passively interested in this kind of science, consider reading Ray Kurzweil &quot;Age of Spiritual Machines&quot;, Hans Moravecs' &quot;Robot&quot;, or &quot;The Spike&quot; by Damien Broderick.<br />I hope this was helpful.much his &quot;that's that on that&quot; basis.

She should be proud of herself because she's a good writer (which is an admirable and difficult to acquire skill), she should be ashamed because she's a poor journalist...<br />...and she's more a journalist.  This \\"expiriment\\" was tainted from the start.  Barbara Ehrenreich wasn't looking to write a expose about the \\"soiled but still intact\\" American Dream (and the (X) ways to avoid getting crushed under it); no, she knew how the story would go.  This was a campaign not to emphasize the legitimite plight of our countries poor, but instead, to further her career and fatten her wallet.<br />I read this book about two years ago not to find fault with it, but rather (as a large employer) to better understand the plight of some of my lowest paid employees.  I believe understanding is the first step towards finding an equitable solution.  Well, time after time I found myself shaking my head as she acted out her \\"impression\\" of an uneducated poor person.  According to Barbara Ehrenreich poor people aren't smart enough to rent rooms to cut their biggest expense (rent) in half while they get on their feet, or to cook at home (vs. go out and spend $11 on a burger and wine), or to exceed the expectations of their employer (hint: that's how you get raises).<br />I barely got through High School, I know what it's like to stand in line with WIC coupons while the cashier decides what food that you picked out will or won't qualify, my paychecks at 13 (when I started working at an Ice Cream Parlor for $3.50hr) went towards buying food, my mom worked as a security co. receptionist by day and waitress by night; I know the agony, and debilitating emotional toll that being poor takes on people...<br />...that was 10 years ago.  After a long hard slog I now own a Consumer Service company (over 1,000 employees), a Software Company (100 employees), a Restaurant, and a Nightclub.  This, according to Barbara Ehrenreich would be a literal impossibility.  How did I do it?  Well, I could go into boring detail...I won't; but at the core of my long answer would be this: OPTIMISM.  I fundamentally believed it could be done.  I took a sales job for minimum wage + commission (Barbara Ehrenreich never did that...another handicap...?), I got a roommate, and I worked 70 hours a week.  Nothing happened at first (but exhaustion), nothing perceptible anyway, but unbeknownst to me, I was learning and developing respect as a hard worker from those that I worked for.<br />That's how you do it.  When you \\"NEED\\" to.  Barbara Ehrenreich never needed to.  She got her story, she made her money.  But at what cost?  It's my belief that this book sapped \\"just that much more\\" desperately needed optimism from our wonderful, ever changing, painfully flawed, but best available ideal we call The American Dream.impossibility.

Nothing happened at first (but exhaustion), nothing perceptible anyway, but unbeknownst to me, I was learning and developing respect as a hard worker from those that I worked for.<br />That's how you do it.  When you \\"NEED\\" to.  Barbara Ehrenreich never needed to.  She got her story, she made her money.  But at what cost?  It's my belief that this book sapped \\"just that much more\\" desperately needed optimism from our wonderful, ever changing, painfully flawed, but best available ideal we call The American Dream.	2004-02-18

John Grisham, take notice, the fast food industry is a fertile field for your genre of writing.<br />As a self-made CEO of a large corporation, you might not expect to find me on the frontline of any anti-globalization rally, or lining up early to vote for Nader (and you'd be right), however, there are verticals within the USA's commercial juggernaut that need closer scrutiny and regulation.  E. Schlosser makes a very good case that the fast food industry should be one of them.<br />I think this book will be an interesting and worthwhile read for pretty much everyone (w/ exception of die-hard fast food burger fans).  Whether you are personally offended by the violence in slaughter houses or concerned about the implications of a &quot;cheaper, faster, cheaper&quot; corporate production philosophy on the already low paid, high risk workforce; you'll no doubt be intrigued by the clear picture the author gives of the dilemna facing everyone (that includes those in the industry with a conscience).<br />I still go to Taco Bell, and love it, but I don't think I'll ever order anything with meat at a fast food joint again...	2004-02-16

I was given this book by my CIO (one of those guys who proudly label themselves as a &quot;nerd&quot;) who told me to &quot;read this book, it's rad&quot;.  We're both voracious readers, so I knew this would be a great book, but I wasn't prepared for it to be such an &quot;important&quot; one.  But important it is.  This book details the life of a remarkably simple man driven by his passion for the truth, the sensory beauty of life, and the many mysteries of nature.<br />Ok, so getting a Nobel Prize and (for the most part) spawning the science of Modern Quantum clearly puts you in the category of &quot;interesting&quot;, what really stands R. Feyman out from the rest of his peers is the exceptional balance he managed to strike in his life between Productive (Science, Manhattan Project, etc.) and Sensory (Travel, Musical talent, wife/women).<br />Stories of him being the only scientist at Trinity (where the first atom bomb he worked on was detonated) to get out from the protected bunker so he could &quot;see&quot; the detonation (jumped behind the glass in his truck because he WAS PRETTY SURE the gamma and X-rays wouldn't harm his eyes) and him leading a protest against the shutting down of a local strip bar (where he would spend many of his final days doing drawings), this book details the life of one of the bravest, most accomplished, and dynamic men of our time.<br />A very worthwile read for those who are looking for a quick entertaining read, or for a hero.  I think you'll find them both in this book.<br />Hope this was helpful.	2004-02-16

I'm a history junkie, but have always taken a particular fascination to American Revolutionary History.  J. Ellis' book \\"Founding Fathers\\" is one of the highest quality of its kind.<br />Ellis doesn't settle in simply recounting the period in some chronological order or with a particular emphasis on an individual; rather, he looks at the entire period holistically.  \\"Founding Brothers\\" examines the extremely precarious, fragile, and doubt ridden formation of this nation.<br />We sometimes forget (as powerful as the USA has become) that this nation wasn't an inevitability, that freedom, liberty, and the pursuit of individual happiness wasn't exactly on the ruling class' minds back in 1700's.  Many millenia had gone by ignorant to the value of these principals before a handful of noble, determined, oppressed, and brilliant men organized and changed history forever.<br />\\"Founding Brothers\\" is an aptly titled play on the popular label for those men (Founding Fathers); it reveals the seldom mentioned intimacy between them, and how personalities, and the interplay between them determined so much about how and when this country would organize and face the myriad difficult choices about what it stands for, and (as in the case of slavery), what it couldn't afford to stand for.<br />This is a wonderful read for all levels; from history buffs to those passively interested in how America became what it is.	2004-02-16

I've read hundreds of books and \\"Choke\\" is tied with \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" (by Hunter S. Thompson) as the funniest I've ever read...I'm talking laugh-out-loud funny.  I read this by the pool at my club a couple of years ago and no doubt came off as something close to a lunatic...but it was worth it.<br />So, just for the laughs this book earns its keep; but more than that, Palahniuk offers a very unique and insightful view into human nature, human relationships, and the perverse notions that drive so many seemingly benign and \\"normal\\" things people do everyday.<br />If you liked Fight Club the movie, you'll love this book. It's modern, hilarious, easy-to-read writing wrapped around a complex and deeply interesting plot about an extremely \\"sick\\" young man, who in his dealings with the \\"normal world\\" throughout the book seems less and less sick by contrast.<br />Very worth the read.	2004-02-16

This is very important book about the powerful role that geography plays, and has played, in determining the relative success or failure of the societies it originates and gives shelter to.<br />I've had some fun in reading through the various and extremely varied reviews on the merit of J. Diamonds thesis.  Many \\"educated\\" minds have weighed in on the validity of \\"this or that\\" aspect of his basis.  Now, I'm not exactly at the forefront of modern biological, political, or social science, but I know enough to firmly believe that \\"geographic determinism\\" is a major influence on societal development.  When I look at it through the lens of Chaos Theory (where big outcomes are sensitively influenced products of tiny variables) it seems clear to me that where societies originated on this map could very well be the biggest factor in determining their success.<br />This is a fascinating read.  Very well researched, peppered with interesting historical stories and insight.  I'm sure there are holes in Jareds position, as is the case with even well developed science, but this is an important addition to anyones understanding about history, societies, and their frequent inequity.	2004-02-16

It's been some time since I read this (about 2 years ago), but I was at the order page (getting a couple of copies for employees) and curiously scrolled down expecting to see nothing but glowing reviews for what has been the most influential \\"biz book\\" I've ever read.<br />I was surprised at the widely varying opinions of this gem.  I guess I shouldn't be, corporate strategies (in similar verticals) are as varied as political ideology.  I'm convinced that just like there will unlikely be any book that unites Republicans and Democrats in one happy envelope of agreement, there will never be one book about business designed to focus companies on \\"The Right Way\\", that everyone will agree is totally valid.<br />I can only offer my personal testimony to how important this book has been.  Since my first read, my business' annual sales have doubled, profit is up ten fold, and we're more organized and focused than ever.<br />The most significant takeways for me were:<br />Figure out what your company is best at doing, then focus myopically on developing it.<br />Get the right people on the bus BEFORE you drive it where you want to go.<br />Each sound so rudimentary, in fact, I went into the book with a cursory understanding of its lessons and believed \\"I'm observing all the central tenets...duh..) only in reading the book and \\"unpacking\\" the supporting basis for each lesson did I realize just how out of alignment my business was.<br />Exquisitely researched, intelligently organized, and well written.  I recommend this book highly to anyone who has a business, or desires to run one.<br />Hope this was helpful.	2004-02-12

Helen Fisher tackles an extraordinarily important but seldom scientifically scrutinized aspect of human existence; love.<br />In this book she delves into the physiological and behavioral contributors to the state of being in love.  Referencing both nature and nurture, the animal kingdom, and (still relatively) modern science she makes a darn interesting case to support &quot;objectively quantifiable&quot; factors as being responsible for an oft classified &quot;ethereal&quot; love.<br />Fun, informative, intensly interesting, I recommend this book highly.<br />Enjoy...	2004-01-05

This is one of those books where, when reading it, you actually feel your brain expanding.

I've been a virtual slave to gaming since I was big enough to pick up a Joystick (remember those things), however, when the PC became a platform to play on (back 'round 86), gaming had a new venue to &quot;get serious&quot;.  Graphics, immersion, networking with other players; most all of these important aspects of the game playing experience were pushed furthest out by the PC, and those coders that were at the front line of that innovation is what this book is all about.<br />The PC/Console gaming industry has already eclipsed that of the movie business, but in my opinion it's only just begun.  Masters of Doom paints a colorful and detailed picture of the &quot;garage and dorm-room&quot; origins of game coding, on through to the big business, big money industry it is today.<br />I would reccomend this book highly to all interested in gaming, business, or good ol fashion American success stories.<br />Enjoy...	2004-01-05

I've read some of his other work, studied his life a bit, and found him to be a pretty cool dude; he was intelligent, curious, and fearless.<br />He was also pretty dark.<br />This book is a wonderful examination of the present (back then) projected into the future, where subtle issues of the day are allowed more time, and through technology, more ability to express themselves.<br />As interesting as the topics of industrialization, government control, and &quot;what happiness is&quot; are, I was dissapointed that (as creative as the man was) he couldn't render a better alternative to a world that had become a very scary and dark place.  For instance, in a society as techologically advanced as the one he describes, why would they abandon efforts to reach immortality?  Take away that spector and it would materially change the relationship between man and happiness, and his use of drugs to augment it.<br />But alas, it's easy for me to be a critic.

My compliments to Walter Isaacson who has crafted a genuine work of art in this biography of one of Americas Founding Fathers and most interesting and important citizens.<br />Neither sensationalist or subjective, the author (through obviously painstaking research and strenous thought) manages to keep the reader informed and entertained throughout the book.  True, he had great \\"raw material\\" to work with, but I've read many a biography like these that turn into \\"Paper Xanex\\" from the first page.<br />I was fascinated by the raw and honest insights into B.

At times during the reading of this book, I actually felt like I knew him personally.<br />Neither an untouchable immortal, or a commoner, Isaacson portrays B.

Hans Moravec does an outstanding job of waking society up to a very real potential road that humans may one day soon take; &quot;mechanization&quot;.<br />Many cringe at the thought of using computers to do anything but send e-mail or surf the net.  However, after reading this, I think you'd be hard pressed to argue that computers won't continue to bleed closer and closer into our personal lives until one day there may actually be some kind of union between the two.<br />And that brings me to my principal beef with this book.  Perhaps H. Moravec has been working at arms length building robots for too long, because to me (a younger tech-savvy reader), if there ever is a &quot;union&quot; between man and machine, it won't be so much a union, but an &quot;augmentation&quot; of humanity.  I will never become &quot;part computer&quot;, but may use a computer to augment my life (enhanced bio-capability, enhanced intelligence, perhaps even immortality).  The &quot;us AND them&quot; contrast Robot seems to paint never sat well with me.<br />Anyway, an informative and entertaining read.<br />Enjoy.	2003-12-25

Also, this book is found in just about every maniacs glove compartment after they blow up a building or something.  So i decided to give it a shot and see what the hell was so special about it.<br />Well, the answer is nothing...  This book just rambles on in its &quot;1940's rebel style.  To be frank it had virtually no redeeming qualities other than the jargon he used (swell, terrific, sexy, flitty, and grippy).  I kept expecting him to break out of his pathetic existence and kill a bunch of people or find value in his life.  He did neither.  Instead I spent a few days reading into the mind of your typical pathetic teenage brat.<br />Don't bother reading.	2001-03-26
