I tried a couple of other books, which left me feeling frustrated-even if they were supposed to be for beginners. Desperate, I tried this one and am happy to say that I'm writing small scripts and becoming familiar with all the different options. <br /> <br />The lessons are well written and easy to follow. The little progress checks and tests at the end of the chapters help highlight the lessons and, if you get any answers wrong, show you where to go back to reread/practice. Although a beginner's book, it gives hints of what can be done, which keep me motivated to continue learning. <br /> <br />It may be that I \\"outgrow\\" this book at some point, but I'm likely to keep it around for a quick reference.	2005-09-28

Sections of it are quite enjoyable, in fact, but an uneven writing style and lapses into preachiness (even when appropriate) keep it from being a better book. I don't mind some commentary about the absurdity of things, but it comes a bit too often in a book supposedly about walking the Appalachian Trail. <br /> <br />There is some profanity, more annoying due to its sudden use after some time without it than the fact that it's there at all. It's almost like Bryson thought, \\"Hey, I haven't been crude in a few pages so let me throw in a couple of pertinent words.\\" <br /> <br />Overall, I wouldn't recommend this as a book to purchase - check your local library for a copy.	2005-05-18

While I did enjoy the book it was more due to Danny than Jeremy Malory. Not that Jeremy isn't fun and charming, but Danny's strong will, determination to better herself despite her background and forthright nature are captivating. <br /> <br />So why 4 stars instead of 5? The ending was easy to predict and getting there didn't involve any real struggle by either character. However, there were some absolutely classic \\"Malory moments\\" and the story is fun, just not up to par with some of the previous novels.	2005-04-30

Spindle's End takes Sleeping Beauty a direction I haven't seen before while still maintaining the intrinsic appeal of the original concept. <br /> <br />As with \\"Beauty\\", the characters are well defined and easy to relate to. The role of magic in the story is creative and presented in an interesting way. <br /> <br />The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the rather awkward climax. There's a rushed feeling to it and the clear narration of the rest of the book is missing. This doesn't mean it's bad, just not quite up the the standard of the rest of the story.	2004-11-16

I love McKinley's Beauty and knew that this would be different but found it a much rougher read than I expected. <br /> <br />The concepts could have been interesting but the writing (unlike most of McKinley's other books) seemed more rough draft than final version. <br /> <br />I enjoyed many parts of Rose Daughter but, overall, it failed to impress me. If you are new to McKinley's work I would recommend \\"Beauty\\", \\"The Hero & the Crown\\", and/or \\"The Blue Sword\\" before \\"Rose Daughter\\".	2004-11-16

I love this book and have re-read it many times. Beauty is a refreshing heroine - intelligent, stubborn, and completely believable. The other characters are also much more \\"real\\" than many fairy-tale characters are, allowing the reader to relate to them in a way that makes the entire story acceptable.<br /><br />To describe the story would make it seem standard fare, but the way it's written makes it so much better than you might expect. If you find Disney's Beauty & The Beast a bit saccharine, try this book as an antidote.	2004-11-16

If you haven't read the first book, I recommend it but it's not necessary.<br />The writing style is different - anecdotes instead of prose. It's fast reading because of this and the characters do come through quite well.

After each major section there is a &quot;lab&quot; where you apply what you've learned. My only complaint with the labs is that there are not always pictures to compare your work with. Other than that I found the book/instructions quite easy to follow and now feel that I could begin working with PageMaker to create documents for our office.<br />I will be getting another PageMaker reference book for more details instructions but plan on keeping this one as a quick reference.	2004-05-11

I bought this book when I visited Best Friends about 2 years ago but only just read it. Why the delay? I was expecting lots of negative stories - people abusing animals, etc. When I finally picked the book up to read I zipped through it quickly amazed at the powerfully positive messages. Yes, there are stories of the bad things that humans do to animals but these are used to highlight the good things that humans can do if they make the choice to care.<br />Almost more than the animal stories are those of the people who made Best Friends real. The compassionate people who saw a need and, out of their own pockets, decided to make a difference. Although the organization became (and is) public it began as a labor of love.<br />If you love animals you will find this book one of hope and passion. It made me wish I could pack up and move to Kanab, UT to become a full-time volunteer!<br />Read the book and, if you haven't already, visit the sactuary itself. It's truly a testament to what love can do.	2004-01-05

He saves for 2 years, then sends away to get 2 puppies. Once the puppies arrive - Old Dan and Little Ann - Billy begins to live his dream, never realizing that more is happening than he is aware of.    This is a wonderful story of the love a boy has for his dogs & the freedoms of childhood. However, Billy has some experiences that take him from childhood into being an adult. Some he is aware of but others are more subtle.    Despite the story being about a boy, girls can relate to a lot of the emotions as well. Adults can more fully appreciate the more subtle storylines.    I highly recommend this book but suggest that you keep plenty of tissues handy.	2003-10-26

Prydain is very much based on Wales & it's mythology but is not just a rehashing of old stories. There is magic, good-vs-evil, personal growth and all other aspects you might expect but the characters are written with such love and understanding that it's almost impossible not to be drawn into the story.<br />As the first book in the series the focus is on introducing us to the characters and their world. Taran is a young man fretting about his place and longing for glory. His dreams come true more than he might want them to as he becomes entangled in the struggle against a great evil lord who wants to take over Prydain.<br />You will also meet Prince Gwydion, Princess Eilonwy, Gurgi, Coll, Dalben, Archen and many others who you will come to love (or fear). Share in the growth, both physically & emotionally, of Taran as he finds out the hard way that being a hero has more to do with a person's character than in their accomplishments.	2003-08-06

Join Taran, Fflewdur Flam, Gurgi & others as they battle to save both Eilonwy & Prydain from the latest threats of evil.<br />This book, like the 2 preceeding volumes, is wonderfully written so that anyone of any age can enjoy it.<br />If you haven't read The Book of Three and The Black Cauldron don't read this. You will be missing so many adventures.	2003-08-06

The land of Prydain, itself, becomes a vital part of the story.<br />I cannot recommend the Prydain Chronicles enough and almost hate the fact that they are listed as children's literature. Certainly, children will love the stories but only an adult can fully appreciate the depth of the characters and writing.<br />If you are reading this review and haven't read the first 4 books, please start with The Book of Three and read them in order. You will enjoy them they way they were intended.	2003-08-06

Taran finds his way hard due to his desire to have noble blood (in order to marry Eilonwy who is, after all, a princess). He has to face his fears, prejudices and the prejudices of others before he finds the truth. Of course, truth is relative and Taran doesn't get a totally satisfying answer.<br />My favorite part of this book are Taran's interactions with the Free Commots, people at ease with themselves and each other, who allow Taran to be whoever/whatever he wants to be.<br />In Wanderer, Taran becomes a man, leaving behind most of his more childish ways. He finally returns home to Caer Dallben just in time to join in the final push against Arawn.	2003-08-06

While I liked the first book better (personal preference, not quality of writing) &quot;Guilty&quot; keeps the suspense going and wraps up the storyline with a totally unexpected ending.<br />Don't try reading this book on it's own - you'd be missing the intensity &amp; mystery developed in the first book.	2003-05-29

Luckily I didn't read this book until after the sequel had been published so I only had a day or two to pick up where I left off.<br />I would have to say that this is one of the best murder/mystery stories I have ever read. It's not a genre I usually read, partially because I rarely have trouble anticipating the ending. This didn't happen with this book (or the sequel). I was left puzzled until the end, which is a good thing!	2003-05-29

I finally got tired of remembering which countries have changed names and other such trivial information so I searched Amazon.com, read reviews and picked this book. A great choice!<br />Although much bigger, heavier and more awkward to use than our old atlas, I would never go back. The quality of the maps and photos added to the large amount of other information makes this a \\"must have\\". The fact that it's so recently published ensures an accuracy that must be hard to maintain in such a changing world.<br />If you want an excellent atlas I can highly recommend this one.

She is emotionally and physically abused by her parents and finds love only from their housekeeper and her younger sister until she finds and helps a German soldier escape from a POW camp.

What I have read, however, is a powerful statement and justification of taking some time off for yourself and how that can be done regardless of the demands on your time. The biggest obstacle in our way is our reluctance to be selfish - putting ourselves first for a change and realizing that if we don't take care of us, we really can't take proper care of anyone or anything else.<br />I'm looking forward to choosing the focus of my year and putting it into practice!	2001-11-11

It often feels more like non-fiction than fiction due to the research done by Richard Matheson. It offers hope and food for thought about what happens to us after we leave this world. Even if you don't believe I'd be very surprised if you didn't think about the possibilities after reading this book.<br />More than life after death, it's a love story. The love transcends death but doesn't prevent tragedy and despair. All-in-all, I find it a more &quot;real life&quot; depiction of love than the sugar-coated, all-is-perfect image so often promoted.<br />Just a word of warning - if you've seen the movie, be prepared for something much better. If you haven't seen the movie, please don't. There is no way to successfully capture the tone of the book without losing much of the impact.	2001-11-11

For me, this book wasn't as gripping as Dragonquest &amp; some of the other books in the series, but I liked it nonetheless. It seemed more like an opportunity to introduce us to more of the characters that we met in the first book, and who we would keep meeting in later books, than a stand-alone story. If you are interested in Pern, definitely don't read this one by itself. It's best to read the books in order as many of the people and story lines run through more than 1 book and catching some in mid-stream could be distracting.	2001-06-03

I first read &quot;Illusions&quot; in my teens, and have read it at least once a year since then. I have also given copies of the paperback to many people with the statement &quot;If you like this, please tell someone else about it&quot;. The parable in the beginning is extremely powerful and the rest of the book shows someone trying to make it a reality. Even if you don't totally agree with the premises, I bet that you'll spend some time wondering about the possibilities.<br />I'm currently going through a rough time emotionally and am actually scared to read &quot;Illusions&quot; right now because I know it will force me to face some truths that I've lost sight of. However, it waits patiently on my bookshelf for when I'm ready to rediscover the joys of distroying my self-imposed limitations.<br />A suggestion: if you like the sayings in the book, put them on index cards and post them around your house or work to offer inspiration on a daily basis.	2001-04-26

Just stepping back to see that we are always making choices (sometimes not consciously) can help us better understand where we are in life and where we are going.<br />As much as I love this book, &quot;Illusions&quot; is my favorite, primarily because of it's simplicity. &quot;One&quot; is complex, not in the writing style, but in the possibilities it presents.	2001-04-26

This book is a perfect bridge between &quot;Illusions&quot; and &quot;One&quot;, but also stands well on its own. Richard Bach opens himself up to the reader, sharing highs and lows equally in his search for self and for a soul mate. I appreciate his honesty about how he almost loses her when he does find her because of certain limits he has set for himself and others. His willingness to share some rather brutal truths about himself make it much easier for me to accept some of my own.<br />Not long after reading this book I did some soul-searching and opened myself up to possibilities I had refused in the past. As a result, I've found my own soul-mate and can even better appreciate how hard it is to break through self-imposed limits!	2001-04-26

I enjoyed following the progression of the dragonriders from hold-beholden to more independence and would like to have had the entire book explore that. While I realize that humanity (even on Pern) has it's negative elements, the nightly news gives me enough of that - I'd rather focus on more positive aspects, or at least the human response to natural catastrophies.<br />All-in-all, a good book and a great addition to the Pern series.	2001-04-13

I can sympathize with  him on his various losses as I have also lost my parents way before I  should have. Scott is a remarkable skater and this book lets you get behind  the scenes. One question for Scott: are you sure that you aren't in love  with Katia?	2000-09-08

Originally given as a gift to my father from a fellow sailor, I had to buy  my own copy since I kept stealing his! Great fun for anyone who sails and  those who wonder why we do. Some of the definitions, while humorous, are  unfortunately a bit too accurate.	2000-09-08
