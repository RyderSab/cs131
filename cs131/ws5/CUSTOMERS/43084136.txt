One can always say the classic response, It was all right and just walk away.<br />The book had much more examples to look at than in had tutorial type examples. It was fast reading. In the sample code the book teaches you the code by mixing it with other new concepts that will be explained later on. This somewhat leaves one with a funny feeling that the whole is not yet fully understood. Most of the sample applications, though sometimes very long in code, are not exactly real world applications. The book seems much easier than what it appears to be. A number of chapters, such as Activex components and data forms, cannot be done with the Learners Edition of Visual Basic thats provided in the book cd.	2003-07-07

My only complaint was that the reader is better off being very learned in all kinds of history because for when the book gives you what really happened and then gives you what could have happened and you are reading it parts at a time, it is very easy to confuse fact with fiction. To combat this problem I guess if the reader is not a history buff then the reader ought to read a chapter in one sitting. The book also seemed loaded with expressions of speech not easily understood by all and the English was hard to follow at times.	2003-07-07

Well written, based on good sources, and about one of the most exciting historical figures of all times. Even long after his death, one cannot underestimate Hannibal.

All the information was pretty much consistent with other Alexander books that I have read. If the author's accounts are true then one cannot blame Alexander's faults. The conquest of Persia in the style of Alexander, more as a builder of nations and not a destroyer, was not really a bad idea since at that time Persia was pretty much in decay, out of control with all its political strife, corruption, and abuses. The only major fault I find in him, if it could be called a fault, was only in dying too early contributed in part by recklessness,  resulting in the split of the empire and ensuing conflicts between the succesors.	2003-05-29

Not that there is anything wrong with that for those who play on the other team. Just that I wasn't able to enjoy it as they can since I don't play on that team. More like a dysfunctional soap opera in relation to contemporary western culture. Not much action in terms of battle scenes. The book makes a great reference on the topic of Boy Love in the ancient world.	2003-05-15

The small bit of information that was useful has certainly made a large difference in my daily workings with UNIX, which more than compensates for the sections that were not useful. Such topics include the uses of the semicolon, piping, redirecting, and scripts. The book is easy to read, sells at a good price, and contains good reference appendixes.	2003-03-18

The different tests are explained and tell you for what situations they can be applied to. Good examples with SAS code and sample data are provided. For most problems, manual calculations are shown before doing them in SAS. This book was not that easy to digest though. Multiple reading will make the material more clear.	2003-03-15

The book fits very well with the true historical accounts of the march. The battle scene at Cunaxa was described with deadly precision.

The book is some what based on true events. Fine archeological discoveries are in the making according to the original source that inspired this book. I thought that the first half of the book was more entertaining than the second half. Lord Inter makes an outstanding sinister character. The plot was realistic since both good and the bad people can bite the dust. Taita the slave is full of virtue, though not without some silly ideas concerning freedom and human anatomy. The front cover features a representation of Tutankhamen and his Queen in case anyone is interested, since the book does not mention it.	2003-03-12

I had to re-read all the chapters, up to four times on some, to get a good grasp of the concepts. I learned some interesting things. For example, not only can statements be either true or false, statements can also be neither true nor false, both true and false, or have various degrees of truthness combined with various degrees of falseness. The book also contains nice and serious logical refutations on a couple of famous arguments for the existence of god that will make any believer a non-believer. Simply Excellent!	2003-03-07

The book is worthwhile for re-reading on a regular basis. So far I re-read it two times. This book is very helpful for daily living. It comes in handy for computer programming when you have to specify conditions, in queries for example or for subsetting data.

Makes a good companion for the novel that it references, In Search of Lost Time if I'm not mistaken. Though not an easy reading at times, it certainly is worth digesting.

Some memorable advice presented is that pain in life is useful and should be use as a stimulus for accomplishments instead of being disregarded.

Like all Durant's other books, this one is very good. Like always, you get everything besides history. This is also a nice treat for the Art student. There too many figures to keep track of though. The reader must read carefully and make many mental notes of names. You get some interesting biographical accounts of all the Renaissance masters. The price of the book is good too.

The book places the reader inside the French Revolution so that one can experience and see what happens through the eyes of the common folk. You will witness one system of barbarity replaced by another and examples of great human deeds unlike no other. The book is full of surprises, so expect the unexpected. It begins very obscurely at first, but that is only an exception so keep this in mind because you might be tempted to quit reading. After reading the book I came to realize that it would have proven beneficial to make mental or written notes of all the characters as they appeared, no matter how insignificant they might appear to be at first. This will help tie things up as the book progresses.	2002-10-26

Not only do you get history, you get zoology, anthropology, myth, and geography. There are many funny things too. You will read about the gold digging ants and the ox that cooks itself. The history concerning the great Persian Wars are spiced up with the dramatics and an exaggeration of numbers. Herodotus believes that Xerses invading army was 3,000,000 strong not including the fleet. The army was so big that it took one week to cross the bridge over the Hellespont and they drank whole rivers dry, according to Herodotus.

Too bad the author dies before being able to complete the work. Reading this made me think how US politicians and rhetoreticians pay lip service to Athenian democracy while in fact this democracy was very different from US democracy and was a democracy that only included Athenian male citizens while women were excluded. Athenian democracy also supported slavery and was abusive to its subject states. Reading this book one learns that the Athenians were the bad guys and that Pericles was a leader who looked out for his peoples interests while disregarding other peoples well being.	2002-10-13

This book is about the negative side effects of such processes. These methods basically are more efficient for the companies employing them, but inefficient for the customer. They put a premium on profits over quality, alienate workers, and are damaging towards the environment. This book will uncover the McDonaldized reasons behind many of our common routines. The main reason why these McDonaldized ways flourish is because the majority of the people believe in them and confirm to them which to me is a form of false class consciousness. Most of such people have been conditioned to such McDonaldized ways so are therefore unable to question these methods. More than ever the Socratic mandate, \\"The unexamined life is not worth living,\\" becomes more important for us to follow.	2002-09-04

You will get your money's worth in DAO.recordset operations. One section of sample code just did not work, which caused me to spend some extra time fixing. It was the code to generate Word Tables (Chapter 14). Better instructions for creating grouped Data Access Pages (Chapter 17) were also needed. I also thought that instructions on running all the code in the last chapter concerning Active Server Pages were lacking. Other than these set backs it was still a great book. I think that in many places in the code there were opportunities for the author to implement domain aggregate functions instead of recordsets, With/End With code blocs, case expressions, Between/ And Where clauses in queries as opposed to two expressions joined together by an OR clause, Between/ And clauses in validation rules for tables, the IN operator in queries to avoid expressions with multiple OR operators, and general sub procedures for events that call the same actions. The more experienced reader will find these places and modify the code if he or she so desires. The author seemed to use the same techniques all the time no matter what the situation was as a way to keeping things as simple as possible, without bombarding the reader with other alternatives.	2002-09-01

The ministry of Love, which is in charge or torturing, is called Miniluv in the language of Newspeak. The book presents a picture of a futuristic cruel society. Unlike A Brave New World, I would not want to live in this society. Some of the things that go on in this book one can relate to the real world. For example, in the book constant war is a stimulant to the economy, which resembles how some presidents use war to stimulate a bad economy in our times. The book also contains a book within a book, which appears to be an original concept. The book within the book describes an elaborate construction of the workings and politics of the Party. The torture that takes place is incredible. The Newspeak language was an interesting idea designed to reduce the possibilities of thought crimes by reducing the numbers of words in the language. The ideal speaker quacks like a duck, duckspeaking, such that speaking originates from the larynx as opposed from the brain. Duckspeaking is a marvelous, but scary idea indeed.	2002-08-20

When people die in this utopia their corpses are taken to the crematorium for phosphorous recovery operations. I wouldn't mine living in this utopia. You get to have lots of recreational sex (orgy porgies) and take lots of the soma drug with no side effects. Children get to play erotic games with each other. One of these games they play is called Hunt the Zipper. Also there is security and stability in this Brave New World, nothing like the New World Order that are leaders are trying to establish. If there is crime, criminals get squirted with the soma drug instead of being shot with bullets. I would only like to live in this Brave New World only if I can be an Alpha and not an Epsilon-Semi moron. I believe that all americans would love this book. The utopia in this book promotes Consumerism and wasteful spending, the two driving forces of the US economy.

The book text is full of errors, mostly omissions, but fortunately the sample code in the cd seems bug free. Common code errors in the text are omitting function types, upper bounds in loops, and numbers on the right side of the equals sign in expressions. Another problem is that the book has you create a Standard exe file in the very beginning for the application, but it appears that that results in problems later down the road. Instead of a Standard exe file select the other option of Working Model Edition, which automatically puts out more controls in the toolbox. Another problem is that the book uses the MaskedEdit control, but you might not have the license to it, so instead you have to do your best with a regular text box control. The book did not mention nor used the With/End With structure, which comes in handy in many places in the code. All this might leave you Scratching your head. Other than that the book is great. It covers the use of many controls, including many ActiveX controls, covers some database, SQL, and ADO concepts, and covers extensively user defined classes. Best of all is the building of an entire application from Scratch.	2002-05-02

It covers a lot of information in much less space. The author programs where ever he can and does not really on macros or wizards. The are a couple typos, but the code is relaible enough. The major problem was one of the chapter databases could not be opened so I took extra steps to recreate it by importing tables from other databases and creating all the forms according to all the specs I was able to get from the book text. The book devotes a good chapter on SQL. The book covers nicely Classes.	2002-03-31

The book is easy to understand, contains almost no typos and the code examples are very reliable in terms of not containing errors. More knowledgeable programmers can spice up the sample code with more functionality, and even beginners can too as they progress through out the book. Since the code examples are unrealistically easy, juicing up the code helps one mirror more real world situations to some extent. One small draw back, and an example of juicing up the code, is that the book does not cover the With/ End With construct, which comes in handy in many of the examples. After reading this book the programmer can move on to more advanced books. Happy Visual Basic 6 programming!	2002-03-31

It is easy to understand and contains very good explanations of the sample code. Very little or no typos or code errors, which always helps. The cd contains one or two useful applications in addition to the chapter databases. What I like about the book was that it makes use of the wizards up to the point where you you have to write code, which is a good time saver.	2002-03-31

The book is overkill on Access VBA. More information than anyone can handle. The code examples can be too long. You can learn, but you have to stay awake and remain alert. If not you will fall asleep. I don't recommend it to beginners at all. For all beginners out there, stay clear of this book. If you don't you might end up hating Access VBA. I thought the book could have been written a lot shorter. I recommend this book to experienced users who want to read a few pages a day.	2002-03-16

The book is clear, easy to understand, no errors, provides good sample code. You can use code examples with any SQL based database with some modifications to fit your implementation. I used MS Access with this book. The largest portion of the book is devoted to Select statements, which is what the majority of users really need.	2002-03-13

I have not worked very much with Visual Basic to say how useful it is. From my experience with Access VBA I thought it dealt nicely with debugging tools and error handlers. I wanted to get a better feeling of debugging before going into other VBA books that reports indicate to be full of bugs. The book is nice in that it briefly touches on subjects like ADO. It seems like it will make a good reference. I really can't complain much since I paid one buck for the book. The only negative criticism that I can say to the authors is that the word open in Spanish is not abir, but abrir.	2002-03-09

Good explanations are given for the examples. Contains real world examples, very useful. I'm getting the best out of the book by reading it all through and running and stepping through the examples. The book does contain a few errors, but very little to make a difference. I'm glad that I bought this book. So will you.	2002-01-04

The author talks about 50 MByte disk drives as being huge and about 5 inch floppy disks. This is like reading Aristotle's physics instead of Newton's. If you use DOS it will help you of course, but ignore most of the talk about hardware. Covers DOS commands very well. Contains interesting trivia about computers too (the life span of a hard drive is about 4 years, unless this is outdated too). To conclude, if you use DOS, it will suite you. Even better seem to be the DOS reference book for Dummies.	2001-12-19
US	43084136	R13LXHKQAGKWO9	0789703254	358155199	Using Excel Visual Basic for Applications	Books	4	6	8	N	Y	Great Book for starters	This is a very good book to begin programming in Excel VBA, but not to end if you will. The book sort of gives you a push and YOU! have to then take the ball and run with it. The book is analogous to how a mother bear chases her cubs away once they are big enough to take care of themselves. The cubs, though with enough skills to survive, are still left with new and open possibilities before them. The reason why is that most of the examples are too easy, making them too unrealistic for the real world. The other is that the book is based on an older Excel version. This book is really great for those people who are scared of programming and want to make the transition, but are not sure of what road to take.	2001-12-19

It's the only book I've seen out there that deals with advanced queries. The book is very insightful and stimulates ideas in one to try out, but many of the examples, however complicated they might be, are trivial in nature. Examples that nobody out there in the real world would want to do unless they want to satisfy some silly curiosity. The examples that come to mind are his organizational trees. Who cares about that? That's going a bit overboard I think. Another thing I remember is how authoritative Joe Celko tries to sound in his presentation of SQL and then he down plays it when he instructs his readers to check with their specific SQL implementation. Other than that the book seems to be expensive. If you must buy it try finding a used copy.	2001-12-19
