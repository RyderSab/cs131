Some of the story is  bit of a stretch and certainly leaves the real world now and then.  It takes a little extra imagination to accept the story.  It borders on comic book style stories ala Indianna Jones.  I enjoyed the book and look forward to \\"Da Vinci Code\\".	2005-07-18

It is just the start of a novel and no where near completed.  Fortunately he didn't get enough into this one to leave us hanging.  Its sad to me that there are no more of these wonderful novels to come.  I have loved them greatly.  But with this tiny bit I have a bit more closure on the story.  Jack Aubrey was finally able to \\"hoist his flag\\".  It would have been good to have this one more novel with Jack Aubrey as an admiral but oh well we at least got to his goal of the flag.	2005-07-18

If you are wondering what Marie Antoinette was like and what her life was like this is the book to read.  Even though the work is very scholarly well footnoted and all it is also very easy to read and keeps your attention.  Along with David McCullough's biography of John Adams is one of the best biographies I have read.  I visited Versailles this summer and my visit was far more exciting for having read this book first.	2005-07-18

There are no real cliff hangers although there is a little mystery about who is going to get murdered before the end of the novel.  The story is told in diary form accounts written after most of the action in the story has occurred.  The monkey talks about a murder that he has committed.  There are a lot of dysfunctional people in the story at times any of them seems to be a good candidate for being murdered.  It is actually these strongly annoying characters that made the story for me, they are well portrayed by the authors.<br />The technology part of the story doesn't always quite hold together especially if you know even a little bit about computer science.  And the tech. is dated a little as well since the story was published way back in 1994.	2004-06-15

The story is about the population of London starting way way back in the tribal Celtic days.  It traces several family lines through to present day.  There is a story vignette for different stages and ages.  I thought the first ones were the best and that some of the ones in the middle read more like a history book being somewhat weak on story.

The descriptions of the canyons and desert make me want to pack up the car and head out for an extended vacation in Arizona right away.  The descriptions are indeed moving.<BR>     The downside of the novel for me is just a little bit too much \\"philosophy\\" out of the post WW1 era.  Grey harps a little to much on his ideal American Woman, American Family, the contrast between the idle rich in New York and the working folks out on the range in The West.  There is way too much writing on the plight of W.W.I vets when they returned to America.  But in spite of a lot of pages devoted to teaching Grey's message there is a wonderful romantic story to be enjoyed.	2003-10-05

Unfortunately this novel goes off into drivel about princes and princlings wearing red and gold outfits and even has people riding horses and harvesting crops.<BR>     This latest in the Andrej Koscuisko series from Ms. Matthews is the weakest of the series.  Previous novels in the series were at times gruesome but also exciting and well written.  The writing in this one is difficult to read requiring that I read a paragraph over a time or two to get it.  The sentence structure is awkward and not always just to try to convey the strange world and language of the planet where the story is set.<BR>     This novel does not stand alone.  One must have read the previous novels in the series to enjoy this one and one must have read them recently enough to remember all about Dormitt Prison, and why what's-her-name hates Andrej so much or much of the story in this novel makes little sense.	2003-01-25

It seems that by the time Forester wrote the predecessor to this novel, \\"Beat to Quarters\\" he had gained maturity and considerable ability as a writer.

Although this novel does stand on its own it does tie in with Ms Matthews's earlier novels with a brief appearance of the Fleet Inquisitor of several earlier novels.  For fans of those early novels it is nice to have the tie.<br />I don't think this novel is as exciting as some of Ms. Matthew's others but it is still a good read.  It is also nice not to have the serious torture violence theme as in earlier novels.	2001-12-08

This book is by far the best book in my stack of parrot books for giving me insight into my parrot psychology.

I have to admit right off that I only got as far as page 168 in this novel.  I was just too bored to continue with it.  It is difficult to believe that James P. Hogan wrote some of my favorite science fiction novels, \\"Code of the Lifemaker\\" (1983) for one, and then wrote this novel.<br />\\"The Legend that was Earth\\" does have space aliens but they really are just another class of people in this novel.

It is difficult to believe that the author of this novel won the Hugo and Nebula Awards and that he won them twice.  \\"The Coming\\" isn't much of a novel.  If you are really into science fiction this novel is not for you.  It is futuristic to some degree but is very light on aliens and space travel and such.  In fact, it is pretty light on story as well.  \\"The Coming\\" is really more about politics, government and relations between people and set in the not so distant future.  But it is a quick light easy read, good filler and better than watching TV.	2001-11-22

No one of them is better than another, they are all good.<br />Erdman's novels are centered around investments economics and high finance adventure.

I am in my mid fifties.  I have a MA in economics on top of an engineering degree.  I was never very interested in investing as an economics student when it was merely a academic subject.  I focused on other parts of my study of Economics.  Now that I am older and trying to determine if I am indeed able to retire now I am finding the subject of investments much more fascinating and \\"Your' Fifty....\\" Extremely informative and helpful in showing me how retire in some comfort and with some confidence that I can sustain that comfort in the face of taxation and inflation throughout the \\"second half\\".<br />I have read several other retirement investment books since this one and found that this one was the best of the lot.  I highly recommend it to anyone who planning retirement savings plans or anyone wondering about retirement right now.	2001-10-02

The best novel I have read in a very long time.<br />  I couldn't love the characters but I did very much love the novel.  It is a good mystery/romance.  The descriptions of Manderley, a big old English country house were wonderful.  So were the descriptions of the everyday routine of life at Manderley from time in the morning room with correspondence and a review of the planned menu to tea in the library.<br /> The author is clearly a class snob and does not speak well to anything she thinks inferior.  The whole idea of the story clearly points up her feeling that there should be special privileges for the aristocracy or near aristocracy.  But it is possible to get around all that because of the story and the descriptions.	2001-10-02

But this one did not have the torture and violence of her other series.  The story didn't hold up as well in this novel.  She had people out on a fleet of colonizing ships traveling to a way station planet four hundred years out from Earth.  What bothered me there was that there was no apparent advancement in much including technology.  Even social structures didn't appear to have changed all that much.  That doesn't work well with no explanation of why not since we normally progress a great deal in all areas in that length of time.  Still it was a fairly good read and I enjoyed the novel.  It was also good to read something without the violence in other Susan Matthews novels.  I don't even like to admit to myself that I have read and enjoyed those novels.	2001-01-01

It kept me up late	Another good book in the Heart of Oak series.  This novel was quite the opposite of the last one in the series I read, &quot;The Black Ship&quot;.   I think both novels give good pictures of how life was on the British  sailing ships but in &quot;Peter Simple&quot; the crew seems to have a lot  of fun and good times as well as taking their work very seriously.  They  are able to joke around a good bit and enjoy life.  This seems much more  realistic to me based on my own experiences at sea.  &quot;Peter  Simple&quot; is written by an actual man of war captain from the Napoleanic  era and so probably portrays a much more accurate picture of life on a  British man of war than any of the other similar novels. I really liked the  novel.  Although some of the coincidences and the ending especially are a  little too much like a &quot;ladies romance novel&quot; I still think  O'Brian fans would enjoy this novel too.  The sea battles and ship  maneuvers are every bit as good as O'Brian.	1999-10-26

There was a lot of superfluous stuff that I just plain skipped over.   The authors tried I guess to make the characters interesting but most were  so offensive to me that I didn't even want to know about them.  That was  too bad because most of the story seemed to be about all the little  personal foibles and problems that the group of oddball characters had  rather than science fiction.  The other problem I had with the novel was  that the techno-babble was not at all believable.  But somehow I got  through the novel and am now able to move on to something much better.  I  certainly will not be reading anything by those two authors again.<br />I  think the editor deserves a good part of the negative criticism I have for  this novel.  The novel should be much shorter.  <br />I don't recommend this  novel.	1999-10-26

It is just another version of the same old story about scientists trying to save the universe from the crazies who are  about to do it in.  Religious crazies in this case are the bad guys.  There  is a lot of &quot;jacking&quot; and lots of war stuff.  There are some  twists to the plot and a little suspense but it doesn't amount to all that  much.  The characters are not strong but rather gray and not entirely  believable.  Still, though, not the worst science fiction I have read.	1999-09-27

I liked &quot;The Black Ship&quot; a lot and recommend it to anyone liking the Patrick O'Brian series of novels and stories about British sailing ships. &quot;The Black Ship&quot; is not a novel but rather a history of  the mutiny onboard a British war ship that took place in September of 1797.   The author based his story on logs, official diaries, Court Martial  records and lots of other historical documents. There was an excellent  personality study on the captain for which Pope even consulted with a  shrink.  That bit of extra really made the account exciting to read and  contemplate. Ordinarily such history would be rather dry I think but Dudley  Pope writes so well that a story came through.<br />     The novel was almost  as good in some ways as the Patrick O'Brian series.  There are not the warm  evenings of music, conversation and toasted cheese at sea in the South  Pacific and such.  Reading &quot;The Black Ship&quot; added to my knowledge  of the life onboard British war ships of the era and hence added to my  enjoyment of O'Brian novels.	1999-09-18

It is not a big book at all.  The book does not go into much detail about things.  For example, the  author mentions the importance of having the right size and type of perch  but never really says what that is specifically.  How big around should the  perch be?  He doesn't say.  If money is no big deal then this is a good  book to add to your collection of books about Eclectus parrots.<br />If you  are interested in becoming an Eclectus breeder this book might be worth  while.  Breeding seems to be the main focus of the book.<br />For dealing with  parrot training and parrot problems and such I recommend &quot;Guide to a  Well-Behaved Parrot&quot; by Mattie Sue Athan.  There are some things I  don't agree with in the book like her recommendation not to carry your bird  around on your shoulder but there is a lot of good stuff in the book.	1999-09-18

This one of his better novels I think.<br />     The characters in this novel are typical of Theroux, they are strong and evoke  a strong reaction.  The novel has been criticized for how it depicts the  Chinese.  Having visited Hong Kong a number of times and studied Mandarin  in Bei Jing I found one side of the Chinese character well described and  represented.  I would say though that another side of the Chinese  personality is perhaps not so well represented.  Many of the Chinese people  whom I know are also very warm and delightful people.<br /> The British I  don't now so well but they do seem to lend themselves to being made fun of.   If you enjoyed this part of &quot;Kowloon Tong&quot; try Theroux's  &quot;Emerald Kingdom&quot;!<br />     The story in &quot;Kowloon Tong&quot;  is exciting and difficult to put down.  This is a novel well worth reading.	1999-09-04
