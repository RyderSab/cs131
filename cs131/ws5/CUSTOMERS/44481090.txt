I've worn out the spine on my copy which I grabbed in 1989 shortly before Stanwyck's death.  This is the finest career analysis movie book that was ever written.  The definitive Stanwyck biography ...that is...about her private life is yet to be written and probably never will be.  Stanwyck was an enigma and remained so until the end.  But this book, by Ella Smith, covers everything about her career that you would want to know...from her start in the theatre to the movies to the television work.  It was a labor of love and I have never found another movie book comparable to it.  A must for all Stanwyck fans!!	2005-10-09

Yes, he forgives, redeems and restores.  We all make bad choices.  We all make mistakes.  No one can cast stones.  However, when the adulteress was forgiven by Jesus he said \\"go and sin no more\\".  I would find more credibility in this story if Sandi Patty had either reconciled with her husband and found a way to work through the problems she was having in her first marriage.  What I'm confused about is that Sandi Patty married the man she had the affair with....and he is just as guilty as she is.  In the first part of the book there is a great act of contrition on her part and sugar coating the details of what took place.  But the second half of the book appears to me that she is glorifying her actions by continually throwing her \\"new found happiness\\" in our face.  Isn't she still committing adultery??  Indeed, the message this book seems to bring out is even though we sin and make mistakes and hurt people, God does forgive and provide restoration by giving you happiness with the one you caused the hurt with!  I'm very confused and if Satan is the author of lies and the author of confusion, then I pray I am enlightened by someone who has read this book and can offer another perspective.  Because it seems Sandy Patty's sin didn't matter anyhow because she's living a golden life with the object of her sin.  I'm very confused......because I'm getting mixed messages..one of which is \\"even though adultery is wrong and you hurt people, once you confess, its o.k. to marry the person you had the affair with and live happily ever after\\".	2005-07-15

This book, obviously intended to lambast the Catholic faith, which is unbiblical and definitely Not Christian, is full of inaccuracies and misconceptions.  First of all Mr. Swaggart needs to cast the speck out of his own eye before he goes about casting specks on others, especially other faiths.  As a Christian and Catholic, I DO NOT WORSHIP MARY and the SAINTS, but honor them for the lives they lived here on earth.  If Catholics pray to the Saints we ask for their intercession which is no different than asking one of your friends, pastor or anyone else to pray for you.  Who do we ask them to pray to? Christ, the Savior of the world.  The Pope is Christ's representative as head of the church here on Earth.  Christ gave Peter the \\"keys to the kingdom\\" and appointed him the first pope.  The pope's decisions are declared infallible, yes, but only after convening with God's representatives and making sure that they are theologically sound and biblically based.  This book is obviously biased and if one is going to criticize other faiths, at least get the facts straight!	2005-07-06

Citing no primary sources in his material, Diorio really doesn't tell us much about Stanwyck that we didn't already know.  Stanwyck will always remain an enigma in the annals of Hollywood history because that was the type of person she was.  Diorio paints a very flattering picture of Stanwyck and only adequately assesses her film work.  The definitive Stanwyck biography is yet to be written.  The closest thing to perfection in Stanwyck books is Ella Smith's fine career analysis \\"Starring Miss Barbara Stanwyck\\".  Diorio's intentions are good and there is some merit in this biography.  It's just a lukewarm attempt, something Stanwyck never was.	2005-07-06

He savagely murdered eight innocent young women student nurses in the sprigtime of their lives and showed no remorse for what he did.  This book, written by the man who prosecuted him and sent him to prison is a factual, precise account of the crime that began the \\"serial killing\\" and \\"mass murder\\" mode.  What is so riveting, yet upsetting and shocking about this book is the fact that nothing is held back and one feels as if he is in the room with Speck waiting to be murdered by him or one of the witnesses at the trial, or one of the jurors or as part of the investigation team.  Its all there and nothing is held back.  I remember being a child of 6 in colorado in 1966 and my Aunt talking about the murders.  The story made national headlines and even reached to a small country town where I was raised.  I was scared then.  About a month ago I was digging through some old magazines and found a people magazine article on Richard Speck from 1991, the year that he died of a heart attack in prison.  (He was never executed though he received the death penalty but the Supreme Court ruled against the death penalty in Illinois so the man got off easy.  But who knows about his eternal soul...only God can judge that).  Anyhow, the article went into depth about what he had done and how one brave woman, Corazon Amurao, one of the nurses, survived.  I looked here at Amazon to see if any books had been written on Speck and found this one!  It is the best account of any Crime that I have ever read.  My heart still reels with sadness at what those poor young women had to suffer and the terror that they must have gone through.  How Corazon Amurao got through everything without going through Post Traumatic Stress is a testament to the way things were handled, her protection and shielding from police and reporters.  Currently she is a nurse in Virginia.  Speck was never punished sufficiently for his crime on this earth.  The evil he perpetrated had far reaching repercussions as it ushered in the \\"terrorist\\" era that continues to this day.  This book is not for the squeamish.  It is excellent and well writing and cuts to the heart from first page to last.  May God bless the young women who suffered at the hands of a madman and may God have mercy on the madman who didn't have mercy on those eight beautiful, decent, hardworking women he killed that hot July in 1966.il he perpetrated had far reaching repercussions as it ushered in the \\"terrorist\\" era that continues to this day.

You never had to worry about where you stood with her because she stood her ground and stuck to her principles!  This autobiography ranks among the best and I, like many have read many great Country Music Autobiographies, some great like Loretta Lynn's, Tammy Wynette's, Jeannie C. Riley's, Jan Howard's, Brenda Lee's and some downright stinkers and self promotion like Reba's and Barbara Mandrell's.  Only Loretta's comes close to matching Skeeters point for point.  Skeeter's story is moving and poignant without being overly sentimental and syrupy.  I was riveted to her story from page one living her life with her as she rose from the depths of Kentucky poverty to Country and Pop stardom of the highest magnitude.  She weathered many, many storms along the way, most particularly the loss of her dear friend and blood sister, Betty Jack Davis and her disastrous marriage to \\"devil incarnate\\" Ralph Emery.  Her final battle was lost to cancer last September and the heaven gained a new angel for its angel band.  Betty Jack and Skeeter are at last reunited in Hillbilly Heaven.  Through it all Skeeter never waivered in her faith and she received the ultimate reward.  The one reviewer who posted a one star review here obviously missed so much of Skeeter's witness that one has to wonder if he/she even read the book at all.  Skeeter was truly one of a kind and this autobiography will make you laugh, cry, and rejoice all at the same time.  Skeeter's music still stands the test of time and her autobiography should be updated by someone who knew her during the last few years of her life.  I am sure there are many who were close to this loving, caring and god-fearing woman.  We are richer for having had her with us!	2005-04-27

However, one does question Kathryn Sermak's motives.  Bette's relationship with her was a tad disturbing but I guess that is perhaps because Bette, by the time this book came out, was in frail health due to alcohol and cigarette abuse.  It seems to me that Bette saw a way to control Sermak and make her a surrogate daughter after B.D. Hyman wrote \\"My Mother's Keeper\\".  In reading \\"This N That\\" I sadly realize that Bette was exactly as B.D. portrayed her.  The only reason Sermak put up with her was so that she could inherit half of her estate upon her death (which she did).  Otherwise, I do not think Sermak would have given her the time of day.  I think Sermak realized that she could put up with Davis a little while longer knowing she didn't have long left to live.  As for the other parts of the book detailing the stroke or her anecdotes about her costars, it wavers between funny, sad, or downright trite.  Read \\"All About Bette\\" or \\"Fasten Your Seatbelts\\" if you want to read a good Bette Davis book.  Skip this one because this one is not \\"All About Bette\\" but \\"All About Kath\\".	2005-02-26

There was no way anyone else could have won that title.  Charlotte doesn't reveal any pageant dirt in this book.  What this book is about is her life in foster care and how she overcame the obstacles put before her to no longer be just another statistic \\"lost in the system\\".  She succeeds brilliantly on all counts.<br /><br />Charlotte, alas, is now a struggling actress with a few B pictures to her credit.  One wishes that after such a triumphant success with promoting her advocacy on \\"foster care\\" that this would have been her mission in life instead of relegating herself to playing inconseqential parts in movies that don't make a mark.  But Charlotte has already made her mark in this world.  For those of us who remember, she will always be the beautiful young lady from Vermont who was crowned Miss Teen USA of 1993!  Hopefully, one day, Charlotte will return to her advocacy in foster care!  This book is superb!	2005-01-07

No, I am not an obssessed teeny-bopper.  I am a 44 year old man with a wife and a family who believe that decency, honesty, integrity and morals are still acceptable in today's society.  Clay has remarkable wisdom and depth beyond his years and could teach Laura from Ontario a few lessons about life and the way people should be treated...with respect.  I had to laugh when I read her review and she said this man \\"failed to capture the hearts of Americans\\"....if he failed to capture America's heart, then why has emerged as the biggest sensation from any other AI contestant?  Why have his CDs gone triple platinum within just a few days of their release?  Why are his concerts complete sellouts?  Why is his book on its way to becoming a bestseller?  Not bad for someone who failed to capture america's heart.  It is just remarkable to me that those who write negative reviews about this wholesome, inspiring young man write 'exultant' five star reviews for the other AI people who have put product out but have come nowhere close to accomplishing what Aiken has.  It is simply sour grapes.  So, please, trust that this book is full of hope, wisdom and edification from a young man who has been dealt some hard knocks in life, but thanks to a loving and caring mother and his deep-rooted faith in God, has emerged chosen BY GOD to be an example of morality, fortitude and genuine goodness in today's world.  One more thing....Clay's fan base holds no bounds....he has fans ranging from 1 to 101.....so much for someone who failed to capture America's heart!!  If he failed in that then I would really like to see what would have happened if he HAD captured america's heart!  God Bless You Clay!	2004-12-08

Mr. Shipman has his details muddled and inaccurate in many aspects.  How he can go into such detail about Judy's private life, sexual deviances, etc. is astonishing....was HE actually present during the actions he describes??  That's the only way he could be so \\"forthright and honest\\"....hah!!  Also, it seems Mr. Shipman thinks that everyone with whom Judy was involved was homosexual or bisexual.  Heck, he goes on to state that nearly everyone in Hollywood is homosexual.  Obviously, Mr. Shipman himself would qualify in this category as he seems obssessed with the subject.  It is inferred to in every chapter of this non-sensical biography.  We know Judy had problems, no one is denying that.  Fans can accept the truth about her but have something substantive with which to back up your claims.....not just hearsay.  This biography stinks and is an insult to the memory of Judy Garland.  As someone else suggested, read \\"Rainbow...the Stormy Life of Judy Garland\\"......that is the best Garland biography ever and does not shortchange or mislead the reader in any way!	2004-11-11

I, however, cannot endorse this book.<br /><br />First of all, Tannen's obsession with Lucy goes beyond normalcy.  This is truly evident, not only in the way he has compared almost every situation he describes with Lucy to a particular \\"I Love Lucy\\" episode but the fact that he makes no secret of his dislike for Gary Morton is beyond reproach and disturbingly creepy.  It is almost as if he's jealous of Gary and wants Lucy all to himself which is what happens most of the time in his anecdotes, which become repetetive and trite after a few chapters.<br /><br />I Love Lucy as much as anyone but to idolize someone to the point of obsession the way Tannen does with Lucy is too \\"far out\\" for my taste.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewer who wrote that Lucie Arnaz only endorsed this book because Tannen wrote what she wanted to hear....that Desi Arnaz was the love of Lucy's life (no big secret)and that he never got the credit he deserved for making Lucy the television institution she became (again, no big secret).<br /><br />The book itself in context, grammar, etc. is very poorly written.  With all the money Tannen claims to have he could have had this book at least edited properly.<br /><br />When Lucy wrote him off for a year after he threw a temper tantrum (which he later regretted) Lucy should have kept her distance completely.  This book, alas, adds nothing new to the Lucy Legend.  As a matter of fact, it detracts greatly from it.	2004-11-05

For the exhorbitant price of $45.00 and higher, I expected a nice coffee-table style book chronicling Dunne's career and her life as well, loaded with pictures.  This is not what I received.<br /><br />What I received was a 178 page synopsis style of Dunne's non-scandalous life (rare for a Hollywood star...she was married to the same man for 45 years!!  Amen to that...refreshing...) devoted to her family, a jewel to work with, and never gave a bad performance.  Along with Barbara Stanwyck she was the best actress never to have received an academy award (she was nominated five times).<br /><br />However, the author skims over Dunne's life, briefly analyzes the periods of her career and says almost nothing of Dunne's later years!!  There Are a few pictures in the middle insert...but none of Dunne as a child or as a mature woman.<br /><br />Irene Dunne was a classy lady who deserves better than what she gets here...a tepid, rushed biography (which doesn't even include a dust jacket) finely printed on glossy paper with the high price that is just not worth it.

However, most of it is repetitous quoting from Doris' own autobiography published in 1975.  The plot lines from the movies are taken from the \\"Films of Doris Day\\" book that came out in the late seventies.  There is nothing new that I learned about Doris from this book that I didn't already know.  It would have been nice to have read about her life after her TV series and her decision to move to Carmel and why she has chosen not to pursue any new Hollywood projects.  But Braun makes a hurried attempt in the final pages of the book to wrap things up and one can't help but feel cheated that they're not getting the whole story.  Oh and one more thing, any true Doris Day fan knows that in the movie \\"Storm Warning\\" in which she dies at the end, the character's name that is played by Ginger Rogers, her sister in the movie, is Marsha, NOT MARTHA.  As I said, I learned nothing new in this biography and wish that A.E. Hotchner would come up with an updated version of Doris Day's autobiography.  It would definitely have been better.	2004-09-12

People who are Bette Davis fans have lambasted B.D. and Jeremy Hyman long enough.<br /><br />This book, written in 1987, after \\"My Mother's Keeper\\" was published, was the sequel.  At the time this book was written B.D. and Jeremy were 'New Christians'.  Almost twenty years later, hopefully, their Christian Maturity has yielded a great harvest.<br /><br />People do not understand the 'charismatic' movement and apparently they still harbor the grudge against B.D. and continue to see her book as 'self-serving' and a slam against her mother.  Sadly, her mother never found the happiness B.D. has been blessed with.  Bette Davis was the most egotistical, self-serving, human being on the planet.  It was her way or the highway.  People continually refuse to accept the fact that the woman was indeed crazy.  Entertaining and wonderful, yes her movies are.  However, Bette continually chose to make her career her God and, I pray she found salvation on her deathbed.  It was too late for B.D. and Jeremy.  They tried their best and she refused all attempts at their help to make her 'see the light' before it was too late.  Again, I only pray it wasn't too late....but folks, there are two sides to every story and the side that B.D. has presented is the one that goes along with every attribute Bette Davis projected throughout her life.  Look at the way she treated Lillian Gish during the making of \\"The Whales of August\\", or the way she treated Celeste Holm during the making of \\"All About Eve\\", or the way she treated Helen Hayes when she worked with her...and countless others.  The truth is there for all to see, but somehow, people are so wrapped up in the 'idolization' of a woman who thought she was the greatest actress who ever lived (NOT!!...and I love her movies!!) that they refuse to believe that her personal life was one in which she thrived on conflict, had so much hate and venom, and ultimately...that hate and venom ate her up alive...called Cancer.<br /><br />I give B.D. the benefit of the doubt.enefit of the doubt.	2004-08-29

B.D. had to defy her mother in every way and Bette's way according to Bette was the ONLY way.  Since Bette had several abortions before giving birth to B.D. how can anyone sanction the actions of a great actress with God-given talents, when in reality she was an insecure egomaniac who threw a tantrum every time someone crossed her path.<br />People hate to hear that icons and movie stars are human beings and this book shows the human side of Bette as told by the one person who probably knew her better than anyone else.<br />I for one thoroughly enjoyed this book because it made me understand Bette's maniacal repuatation for chewing up her directors, the envy she exhibted toward other actresses because she thought that SHE and ONLY SHE was THE BEST, and the control SHE HAD TO HAVE in her every way.<br />B.D. has been blessed with a happy marriage for nearly forty years now and has two fine grown well adjusted sons.  Bette should have been proud of that.  No, Bette attested to the fact that all men were ______ and could never accept the fact that Jeremy Hyman was the perfect man for her daughter.  Her daughter found the happiness that eluded Bette all her life.  Did Bette's career give her happiness?  She turned to drink and became a drunk.  So, no, her wonderful career did not give her happiness.  B.D. makes this point in her book.<br />Bette shared her gifts with the world.  B.D. shares the private moments as well and she does it candidly with nothing but good intentions in mind.<br />I enjoy watching Bette Davis movies.  But she was NOT the greatest actress who ever lived.  A great actress can play drama, music, and comedy with equal finesse.  Her range is unlimited.  For my money there are only three stars who fit into this category....Barbara Stanwyck (who could play anything without resorting to eye bugging, hamming mannerisms), Judy Garland who was the ultimate consummate entertainer and Doris Day who when given the opportunity was able to display her fine dramatic talents in addition to her comedy and musical ones.<br />Bette Davis could only play Drama.  And she did it with mannerisms that were distracting.  She is fun to watch, though.  But since she hated herself and everyone else who didn't do as she said, she never found true happiness.

She was an alcholic, a control freak and almost the same nymphomaniac that Joan Crawford was.      I cannot judge B.D. and her motives.  Bette's actions were there for the world to see. Most biographies tell the stories of the despicable way Davis treated co-stars like Celeste Holm in All About Eve, Helen Hayes and what she did to Lillian Gish in \\"The Whales of August\\" was unbelievable!  Never mind what she did all through her career to her directors (if they weren't strong enough to stand up to her).   Davis was a consummate actress whose mannerisms are laughable in some of her films.  But she should never have married or had children.  Her career, as I mentioned was her GOD!  All B.D. tried to do was to make her mother realize this before it was too late.  Sadly, it didn't work.  God Bless B.D. and God forgive Bette Davis for misusing her God-Given talents.	2004-07-09

Three months after Tammy's passing George RIchey marries a &quot;Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader&quot;?  So much for the grieving widower.  Tammy's death was shrouded in mystery and no one will ever know for certain what happened.  But even Loretta Lynn states in her new autobiography &quot;Still Woman Enough&quot; that she thinks its sad that Tammy never found true love in real life.  Tammy was fragile, vulnerable and naive.  Its obvious she let George Richey use her and milk her until she could take no more.  I do not blame her daughters for wanting to know the truth.  The sad thing is that people don't want to know the truth or the truth to be told.  If my mother had died under such circumstances I would want to know the truth too.  This book is a must read...Jackie truly cuts to the chase and George RIchey should be ashamed to show his face anywhere.  Its obvious he never loved Tammy the way he said he did.	2004-07-05
US	44481090	R2ZSDRTURPDRNK	1581822987	200006139	Goodnight John-Boy	Books	4	100	104	N	Y	Great but some of the story synopsis' are inaccurate	As a fan of \\"The Waltons\\" since I was 11 when the show premiered in 1972, this book is a must have for ALL fans!!  It is truly insightful with many wonderful photographs.<br />The best part of the book of course are the season by season synopses of the episodes but some of them are inaccurate.  For example in the synopsis for \\"The Thanksgiving Story\\" there is a subplot with Jason helping the Baldwin Sisters making 'The Recipe'.  The sisters decide they want to adopt Jason. However, in the brief synopsis given in the book it is mentioned that BEN is the ONE they want to adopt.  Any TRUE BONA FIDE WALTON FAN knows this is wrong.  It is Jason whom the Baldwin Ladies had affinity for.  THe research for the synopses could have been better as they are brief but I appreciate the commentaries that have been included with some of them.  There could also have been more interviews with the cast.  I have read and re-read the book many times and have no interview to find with David Harper who played Jim-Bob.  Everyone else was included, why wasn't he?  Maybe he just didn't make himself available.  Another piece of information that should have been addressed but was not was the fact that Richard Thomas was NOT the ONLY John Boy.  During the last 2 seasons the show recast the role with actor Robert Wightman in the part.  Of course, Richard Thomas was the definitive John Boy and the show wasn't the same after the fifth season, when he left.  Why they recast the role will forever remain a mystery.  This, by no means, is a reflection on Robert Wightman who brought his own sensitivity and depth to the role....but it WAS a role that COULD not and SHOULD NOT have been recast.  It would have been interesting to read Hamner's explanation as to why this was done to give Wightman some credit.  He did the best he could given the circumstances.  Also, I would have liked to have read more about why Michael Learned left the series during its 7th season and Ralph Waite during the beginning of the final one.  These issues weren't talked about, either.<br />These are minor quirks for a fan like me.  All will find this book enjoyable despite the minor flaws mentioned above.<br />What I have been waiting for and wondering about is when are they going to release all 9 seasons on a DVD boxed set.  This show would make a mint!!!!!!!!!!  Classic series like \\"Gilligan's Island\\", \\"Lost in Space\\" and \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" are selling like hotcakes and \\"The Waltons\\" should be right there with them.<br />Columbia House has put some episodes out on VHS but they are a waste of money.  They pick episodes at random and never offer a complete series.<br />I have most of the episodes taped off the \\"Family\\" channel when it was airing them years ago.  But the problem with them is that they are butchered and incomplete.  What we \\"Waltons\\" fans need now is a complete season by season boxed set on DVD and then we can truly say \\"Goodnight John Boy\\".<br />Earl Hamner I hope you're reading this.

Having watched the movie numerous times, this book was a must-read.  It is riveting from page one until the end.<br />Betty Mahmoody went through hell with her Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde husband.  There are many reviews I see here (mostly from Iranians) that renounce Betty and deny that Iranian culture is as she has depicted.<br />However, I worked with a young lady who married an Iranian and he treated this sweet, beautiful girl the way Dr. Mahmoody treated Betty.  And he did this while in America!!  Furthermore, when his family visited him and she brought them into our office to see where his wife worked they were exactly as Betty Mahmoody described her own in-laws.  The women were clad in their chadors barely daring to breathe...(while we held our breath because of their 'stench'.)  This young man (my friend's husband) wouldn't let her associate with any of us outside the office and she was deathly afraid of him.  As a result, she finally divorced him, thank the Lord, and moved back to Michigan with her family.  Thank God she had no children by him or she would have suffered the same fate as Betty and Mahtob.  One time he actually threated to cut her up in pieces and throw them in the garbage can...(sound familiar????)<br />THis is why I believed every word Betty wrote in her book.  No one should be treated as subhuman, male or female.  True, there are good and bad in every culture, including America.  Unfortunately, seeing what my friend went through and reading what Betty and Mahtob went through with these 'animals' makes me proud to be an American and never to take anything in this country for granted.<br />People won't accept the fact that what Betty Mahmoody went through was harrowing and true.  I believed every word she wrote and thank the good Lord above He helped her get away from the devil himself!!	2004-01-24

Considine's approach to the lives of these two legends is humorous, well documented and fascinating.<br />We learn nothing new about these two old broads (something Joan told Bette never to call her).  We know they hated each other.  We know Bette was jealous of Joan's looks and insatiable sexual appetite, and we know Joan was jealous of Bette's talent.<br />But this is what makes it so campy and so much fun to read.  The two going at each other makes for never a dull moment.  What I'm convinced of is this:  Joan Crawford WAS indeed a phony.  She played the MOVIE STAR game to the hilt and I'm convinced also that what Christina wrote in her memoirs is the truth.  I'm also convinced that Bette was an egomaniac who thought she was the greatest actress who ever lived...(Wrong!!  That's a title that belongs to Barbara Stanwyck!!).<br />This is one of the best books written about these two ladies and it doesn't make me sympathize with one more than the other.  They were both 'crazy'!!!  Fun....but 'crazy'!!!	2003-07-15

I perused this piece of 'trash' at a local bookstore one afternoon.....spent all afternoon 'speed reading' it out of curiousity.<br />This woman will stop at nothing to get what she wants.  Something we already knew about her.<br />This ponderous piece of garbage and lies adds nothing new to the Clinton name except that it confirms that 'evil' continues to thrive in America.	2003-06-14

This biography, simply written, is a fascinating look at one of the holiest young men in history.  Many tears were shed while I was reading this enthralling biography and made we want to get my hands on anything written about his life.  Trying to emulate Gerard Majella would be impossible, but that's why he is a saint.  The miracles that God worked through him are numberless.  His faith was incredible!  Most of all his obedience to God and trust in Him was just absolutely aweinspiring!  Anyone familiar with St. Gerard Majella knows what kind of man he was.  This book thoroughly reinforces this fact and I simply could not put it down.  I read it through in one sitting.  Truly inspiring, edifying and just a beautiful testimonial about a beautiful saint!!	2003-01-25

This man was truly a saint of GOD!  That's why God called him home just as his life and vocation was beginning.<br />Don't miss this one!!	2002-09-24

Almost everything in here has a false note to it.  Any Eddy fan knows that the love of his life was Jeanette MacDonald and that Ann Eddy only used him for his name and stature.<br />Aside from all the untruths in this book, the rest of it is all mish/mash and fodder.  This book does a great injustice to a great singer and a fine actor.<br />If you want to get the real Nelson Eddy story...read &quot;Sweethearts&quot; by Sharon Rich.  There you will get the real truth and I wonder why biographers continually support the myth that both Eddy and MacDonald were happily married to others.  Nothing could be further from the truth.<br />Save your money folks....this book is not worth it, believe me!	2002-08-01

It presents MacDonald as a 'saintly' woman who could do no wrong.  We are all human and so was she.  She is put on a pedestal, no doubt to please her husband who we all know was a notorious homosexual who slept with another man on their wedding night.  The author has chosen to sugar coat their lives and put them on a pedastal where no one can reach them.  <br />You would do better to read Sharon Rich's labor of love \\"Sweethearts\\".  There you will get the real Jeanette MacDonald story as she has the evidences to back up her claims.  <br />This biography was very poorly written as well.  A great injustice done to a great lady.  <br />But to be fair, the book is full of nice pictures.  That will merit one star from me.  Forget the rest.  Read \\"Sweethearts\\" instead....you will get the REAL Jeanette MacDonald story there!	2002-07-21

I happened upon Loretta Lynn's new book by accident and I finished it in ONE DAY!  Impossible to put it down. Like &quot;Coal<br />Miner's Daughter&quot; &quot;Still Woman Enough&quot; is written as if Loretta were sitting having a chat with you telling you all that happened.<br />Her memoir is revealing and she holds nothing back.  And I was<br />shocked at some of the 'things' she had to go through with her<br />beloved husband.  She says often throughout the book that these are things she couldn't tell while he was still alive....and small wonder.<br />Loretta Lynn is a remarkable 'just a person' person!  If you don't know why Loretta is universally loved, this book will show you why.	2002-04-07
