However, in the forward, he apologizes to some readers that have praised previous works, that this novel is not quite like the rest.  Regardless, it is an excellent read.<br />Maria is a young introspective Brazilian woman, who also records in her diaries, her thoughts on the nature of the world from a very young age. Very young by not responding to a boy's request for a pencil, she felt she lost an opportunity for her eventual soul mate. She is a very young woman intent on fulfilling her destiny of one day being a wife and mother.  As with many people, life often brings much different than what we have planned and it works out that Maria ends up going to Geneva, Switzerland to pursue fame and fortune. All the while Maria is living her life, she is noting what she experiences and sees and is trying to piece together how life and love work.<br />Unfortunately, her plans in Switzerland fall through and Maria is presented an opportunity quite unplanned for.  She enters the world of prostitution.  Maria quickly learns the rules of the game.  In her diaries, she is concerned about the affect her profession is having on her perception of love.  She theorizes that so many people put so much importance on a single act, so much fear, planning and importance, that when boiled down, the act is a mere 11 minutes.  Hence the title of the book.<br />While working as a prostitute and justifying its separation of sex from love, Maria meets a artist that professes his disinterest in sex, in fact he says he is bored with it. Maria suspecting he is no different than the others, just using different lines, initially continues the friendship at a distance, all the while suspecting his motives. Her artist friend always comments on \\"her light\\" which he can said he could see upon their first meeting when he sketched her in a restaurant.  Each time they meet their conversation is cloaked in much symbolism as the Road to Santiago and the significance of certain things. As time goes on Maria due to her association with the artist is drawn into some of the club she works for special clientele and explores a side of sex that she finds intriguing and is not exactly part of her theory as yet.<br />Without going further and ruining the story, Maria's running dialogue in her mind and in the diaries she writes shows and intelligent albeit superstitious young woman's way of dealing with the sex trade's disassociation of sex with love.  Her thoughts and theories are intriguing and quite compelling. Her conversations with the older librarian she befriends and the young artist are interesting in both what is included and omitted from her conversation and the reasoning why.  Also you are provided with some of the librarian's thoughts and feelings from an entirely different prospective.  This was as revealing in a different sense.<br />Some might find the material a bit to risqu&eacute;, however, given the fact the story clearly is about a prostitute, this should not be surprising.  In many ways it is more tame than some of the prime time TV shows.<br />I find the book compelling in the sense that it treats the subject as most people would when thinking about what to do, the moral justification, the concerns, the mysticism about the way to or not to act.  There are milestones in a person's life and the character Maria clearly had a sense of when several were met in her life.<br />I would definitely read more from this writer.ked in much symbolism as the Road to Santiago and the significance of certain things.

Angels & Demons and the DaVinci code (which I thoroughly enjoyed) were the first and second of his books I read and this prompted me to be concerned that his attention to detail and crafting a wonderfully involved story was limited to Religious symbology and similar doctrines.  Well, I had nothing to worry about.<br />MAIN STORY, VERY BRIEFLY:<br />Deception point revolves around a political campaign, NASA, geology and marine biology.  Strange bedfellows aren't they, but it works.<br />Rachel Sexton a gister (yes, I spelled that right) for the government is contacted by the president.  Her boss is concerned, it is for political manipulation as her father is a U.S. senator, the president's opponent in the upcoming election.<br />As the day's events unfold, Rachel is very divided as to who is being truthful or not.  She is to be witness to a great discovery along with many famous scientists.  Is the president banking on her family name or her reputation with data?  Both could be true or it could be something else entirely.<br />When there are questions about the situation she is involved in, things get very complicated very fast and who are friends and enemies is not so clear cut.<br />CONSISTENT WITH DAN BROWN'S STYLE AND EXCELLENT WRITING:<br />As with any of Dan Brown's books, each chapter is brief well-crafted and builds up to a phenomenal story line.  If you like a book (and I do) that brings in bit by bit all the main players and crafts their story until it interweaves in an amazing climax, this is the book for you.  I personally am not politically oriented, know little about NASA and could care less about marine biology and geology, but I had difficultly putting this book down. Each section was riveting and each wanted me to read on.<br />Great job, when are you going to write more?	2004-03-09

You feel the weight of the policewomen's tool belt and the subtle changes in behavior that quickly mold the rookie cop into the seasoned professional.  She doesn't just capture the voice of the woman cop, but that of the human being that has chosen an at times very de-humanizing job.  This job, will affect their perceptions outside as well, forever.  They will never look on normal day to day life quite the same again.<br />BOOK IS IN 5 VERY UNIQUE VOICES:<br />The book is broken up in 5 very unique stories, with one woman police officer as the focus.  Some are cops earlier in their careers, others are after they have become jaded and looking back.  Others are focused on a single riveting situation.  Each brings in a voice very human and very real.  Unique too are some of the family relationships that provoked the officer to pursue this line of work.<br />The book is arranged in groups of stories.<br />KATIE:<br />The group of stories called Katherine, give you Katie Joubert's point of view.  There are 3 stories where she tells you of the time she killed a man, her emphasis on training your senses to do the job, and the myth she became.<br />LIZ:<br />The second set of stories are about Liz, who is eventually no longer on the regular beat.  Her story is not so much of one about policework, but of relationships.<br />MONA:<br />The third set is of Mona, a policewoman who has joined the force coming from the legacy of father who was a cop.  Their relationship was not a good one and both this relationship and the hardness required from a job, are damaging her relationhips with her own family.<br />KATHY:<br />The forth set is of Kathy and her involvement in an unusual case over a long period of time.  How first impressions can change and change again.<br />SARA:<br />The last set is about Sara, a woman whose involvement on a case became very personal and drove her to run away from all that is familiar, only to realize, it all comes with you.<br />ALL SO DIFFERENT, BUT EASY TO EMPATHIZE:<br />The author brings to life, the regimentation, the nerve racking tension and the at times visceral feelings many police officers face and puts it in terms any of us that have a routine can understand.  Co-workers quirks, breaks, lousy coffee all are intimately painted in the character's palate of this very unique job.<br />IN SUMMARY:<br />I found this book hard to put down.

In this book she brings you lives in a small town, with many little secrets, and one big one.<br />Two young girls grow up together in a small town.  For all intents and purposes, their lives, should end up being carbon copies of one another.  However, one has a mother that doesn't quite fit in. She's from out of town and never quite fit the mold.  As time goes on, both girls consider themselves inseparable until one major event in the town changes, their lives forever.<br />From this point, their paths are changed, the mold is cast and they will never see things quite the same again.  The rest of the town as well, reels from this event, bringing it from its sleepy complacency.<br />However, as all children do, they grow up and start to stretch their horizons.  A small connection to the past that helps one of the girls heal from the earlier events nearly tumbles her into a new despair. It is a situation she can't fathom and opens many old wounds.<br />This story of Kit and Cleo, one of Maeve Binchy's fine novels, reminds you that things are not always what they seem and a point of view can change over time, when the world tests your character and your relationships.	2003-09-23

Unfortunately her husband David sees otherwise and feels Martha has gone crazy.  First he tries to get her to see a psychiatrist and once she flees he hires a detective to find her.<br />The story is of this flight and of life on the lamb in the wilds of Texas.  It is also a story of how we perceive things.  Kathy Hepinstall does a magnificent job of sharing Martha's thoughts on this flight in terror.  She also gets into the head of the private investigator pursuing her.  You can see what motivates each party.<br />What makes this story unique is something I never anticipated, a revealing secret.  After reading Kathy Hepinstall's previous work \\"Absence of Nectar\\", I should have been a bit more prepared.  Excellent job.  She got me with this one.<br />I looking forward with anticipation more of her future books.  I felt there was a massive difference between Absence of Nectar and this work.  It was all for the better.<br />The only thing I would change is the horticultural and geological references.  Refering to a bush by its proper name only found on a tag in a gardening store, leaves most of us not familiar with the area a bit lost.  I'm a fairly knowledgible gardener, but in upper NY state.  I would hardly know what a tar brush or what an arroyo was.  Also unless I looked up some of the geological formations, I would be lost as well. I think it is important when writers look up information to properly write about it accurately, to consider the ignorance of most of their readers.  I would follow the lead of many good sci-fi writers and start with the point the reader has no clue and gradually reveal the pertinent information if it is important.  If a more generic description would suffice, unless it were directly pertinent to the story I would use that.<br />All in all a great book.  One odd little thing I liked was short chapters.  I felt like I breezed through this book and was sorry when it ended.  That means it captured my imagination and was a good book.fice, unless it were directly pertinent to the story I would use that.  <br />All in all a great book.

I purchased these cards in hope they did not look as rough as previous sets, I have seen of the Rider-Waite deck, but I was not too surprised that they do. This is not due to lack of craftsmanship, they are a nice set of cards, well packaged well-machined but the artwork, is clearly and older style. Also, I have a bias; I'm not too thrilled with lemon yellow and aqua-blue and that is the predominant color of these cards.<br />That being said, I'm sure these cards are faithful to the original plates, they are reproductions of. Also when I had tried to purchase these cards in a store they were nearly twice as expensive as they are here online.<br />Considering that, even with my disappointment they are a good deal.<br />I purchased these cards even though my favorite set is the Morgan-Greer deck.  The Morgan-Greer deck has beautiful rich colors and full card illustrations. However, the Rider-Waite deck is one of the card sets available in the Tarot magic computer program I have. The Morgan-Greer is not. This computer program helps you learn Tarot, as well a providing readings from many sets and spreads. Of the sets on the Tarot Magic program, the Rider Waite deck illustrations more closely matches the Morgan Greer than the other decks do. I wanted to learn Tarot somewhat consistently. Also many Tarot books use the Rider-Waite deck as well. It is a handy reference deck to have.	2003-05-02

As usual Maeve Binchy fleshes out the characters and you can understand very quickly what is going on.<br />What I like about each of these stories, is that it shows a point of view, of a character at a pin point of time.  That pin point of time, is a crossroads.  They can opt to continue on, in their well worn rut or they can make decisions that change their lives.  These are not earthshattering choices, but ones that define their character.<br />If you don't want to settle into a book that will take a while to read, and you've never read Maeve Binchy, here is a good taste.  I liked it especially well, as when I read it, I had little time available to read, it gave me just enough story to ponder on, each time I read.<br />Excellent bunch of stories.	2003-04-25

As many friendships go after being separated by geography and time it fades.  However, during WW II, Elizabeth's mom Violet when faced with the dangers of England during the war, drew on this friendship when she asked her old friend Eileen from convent school now living in Ireland to shelter her daughter.<br />After 5 years together, Elizabeth and Aisling friendship grew strong, and the ties to Ireland from England were forged.<br />This story follows the lives of these two young women and their families in their early years in the same household to their lives later separately as young woman.  As in many of Maeve Binchy's other books she richly draws out the characters of these women and you feel they are old friends by the time you put down the book.<br />What is to me typical of Maeve Binchy's books, is that the lives and situations are your average day types.  You feel these are people you could see on the street or could live next door.  However, being a part of their lives is compelling.  You can see when they make mistakes and how they solve them, or make them worse.  Better yet by the end of the book, you have a good idea how they will behave given the circumstance.  Make no mistake though, her books are not boring.  You get to the point you can't put them down, so involved you get in the lives of the characters..<br />Once again, a remarkably well done book.  Interesting ending too.	2003-04-25

If the message is affected by the medium, it may well not be the same message, or only a simplistic rendering of a deeper thought.<br />He goes on to discuss, how society today communicates as well as how it now educates.  Since TV has done so well, to grab children's attention, the educational system is modeling itself after it.  Now instead of bringing ourselves to the messenger (as they did in the time of the written word).  We expect the messenger and the message to come to us.  Of course it has to be packaged in a fashion we will accept: Entertainment.<br />Children and Adults are being trained to expect entertainment out of the most mundane or tragic events.<br />Consider the nightly news, its sound bites and sound track.  The worst events of the day are being pre-packaged to make them more palatable or interesting, so viewers won't change the channel.<br />Additionally, we are being deprived of information we do need to be concientious adults in our society, not by any &quot;Big Brother&quot; restricting this information, but by the shear glut of information that clouds what we truly need to function.  If you think of advertizing, how much of it discusses the features of the product versus how much advertizing emphasizes psychological points of how great we will feel if we buy this product.<br />Given the date of the book, he only touches on the medium of the internet.  However, when I've reviewed usability texts on internet design, they are clearly designed for the television watching audience.  There is great emphasis on sound bites and organized groupings of information, clearly designed for those of us with short-TV-based attention spans.<br />The big question, is where does all this lead?	2003-04-08

The story is about a place and time and how several people's lives unfold over a period of about 30 years.<br />The copper beech is a landmark by the local school in a small town in Ireland.  It is marked by the local school children upon graduation and provides a point of reference for many as they grow up.<br />This book chronicles the lives of several of the local people through their own eyes.  You see the priest, the young school mistress and several other local town's people recount major events and how they touch each of their lives.<br />What I found particularly interesting is how each event is perceived differently and how each imagine each other's lives.  It kind of makes you think for a moment as you look around at the people you know. Makes you realize that you color what you imagine their lives to be, with your own palette and with only partial knowledge.  Yet, you often take this as fact rather than your own opinion and are shocked to find out otherwise.<br />It is a thoroughly enjoyable book and leaves you feeling that things aren't always what they seem.	2003-03-03

However, even those were a bit light from what I am used to from her as an author.  Usually, her writing really clicks with me and this book did not to the extent I'm used to.

This book is also equal to that wonderful book.  Here as usual you get in the skin of her characters, from their observations to their priorities and justifications.<br />In this book emigrant Stefan Blau comes to the US and eventually settles in a small town in New Hampshire.  He has picked up the skill for French cooking and does well for himself in a small restaurant he creates.  However, this is not his dream. His dream is an apartment building he is inspired to build: The Wasserburg.  In a daydream while boating, he is inspired not only by the building he imagines creating, but a child he imagines playing in its courtyard.<br />Stefan's financial adventures go well, but his personal life is troubled.  Things go on that bring one misfortune to the other to his doorstep.  I don't want to go into too much detail and ruin the book, but this book isn't all doom and gloom.  This is a not-so-typical families saga, with both good and bad.  However, there are forces in Stefan Blau's life that eventually steer him to lead his life in a particular fashion.  This book chronicles Stefan Blau's family over 3 generations and 2 continents.  An excellent tale of a family, the ties that contrict, bind, bond and break one.<br />SOLID SENSE OF EACH CHARACTER AND WHO THEY ARE:<br />As always Ursula Hegi fleshes out her characters.  You understand the motivation of Stefan and his family right down to the youngest grandchild Emma.  Not till the end of the book do you understand the meaning of the name... At least I didn't.<br />YOU CAN PICTURE THE WASSERBURG:<br />What I particularly liked is the description of the house.  You can see it through the author's eyes.  I love houses so this was pleasant.  Also, you see the basis for all the characters, but not in a descriptive way.  You get in their skin.  This story centers around a community and a family living in this one building.<br />YOU CAN IMAGINE BEING GERMAN AND IN AMERICAN DURING WWII LEFT YOU FEELING DIVIDED.<br />One other point, I imagine dear to Ursula Hegi's heart is the portrayal of a German family in American when Germany was the enemy.  She describes how the immagrant family feels out of place in both country, but beholden to both.<br />An excellent read, hard to put down.descriptive way.  You get in their skin.

Here once again, he masterfully creates a world for his characters and he delivers this world to you in a way that makes the reading easy.<br />This novel centers around a physicist caught in the middle of office politics in the university he works in.  This is not so much the basis of the story but the setting that the story begins with.  At the university this physicist has created a device that enables you to explore other worlds on a different plane of existance.  However, some minor problems with the use of this device ensue and the initial inventor of this device, who has been brushed aside due to these politics, has been asked once again to help with it.<br />Totally unarmed with previous information he is thrust into one of these anomaly worlds with only the idea that the physics in control of this world may be somewhat different.  What a beginning!<br />As the main character Dennis Neul explores this world you understand his observations as all from earth would.  However, pulling together his various theories based on Earth rules, don't add up and he is forced to adjust his earlier assumptions.<br />There is a complication that extends his visit and he is thrust in the middle of some hostilities that are currently dominating this world.  He interacts with the locals and begins to understand more of the local customs and rules of physics.<br />This book is classic Brin.  His well thought-out science that is so easily portrayed to the reader is a joy.<br />You will thoroughly enjoy this book.	2002-12-28

A dying relative leaves her and her brother one of her childhood homes.  She and her brother lived with her grandparents after the premature death of her mother.  She had a strong bond with both her grandparents, so this long forgotten places beckons to one wondering about her future.<br />Once there Cath finds some old diaries and begins to read them. Here Sue Miller intertwines pieces of Cath's past and that of her grandmother Georgia's.  It was a different world when her grandmother was a girl and she is reminded of that in these diaries.  She is also given an opportunity to see a side of a grandmother, she never imagined.  However in her mid-50s somethings remembered fit in with new information gleaned from the diaries.<br />Also for me personally when Sue Miller wrote of Georgia's stint in a TB sanatorium, it struck a nerve.  My dad was a TB survivor of the WWII era and met my mother a girl from the town the sanatorium was in.  As I have a disease to thank for my existance, this peculiar sanatorium life has often interested me.  This book also gives me an opportunity to see the seriousness of the disease at the time.  Unlike today's age of intervention and cure, then most patients were given rest and care in hopes their bodies would do the work of the cure.. Very different than today in many ways.<br />As time goes on Georgia considers her life in earnest and her relationship with those living and dead in Vermont and comes to terms with what will be the next step in her life.  What I found interesting here is how \\"events\\" both big and small are used as turning points in one's life.  Do we need them as an excuse or as a marker of change?<br />I never walk away from one of Sue Miller's book without wondering about my own life and neither will you.	2002-11-18

It is a very well written book and keeps your interest from beginning to end.<br />SMOOTH WRITING CONTRUCTS THE WORLD:<br />This being my second David Brin book, my first was Kiln People, I amazed at his writing.  As a sci-fi buff so often the description of the &quot;world&quot; the novel takes place in is cumbersome.  There are explanations of the situation, technology and social structure that weigh down most sci-fi stories.  David Brin has a wonderful way of weaving this into his stories so they are part of the dialogue or the unfolding scene.  Trust me, this makes reading his books effortless.  I found this to be true in Kiln people as well.<br />A TALE OF A DRIFTER:<br />The story takes place after society is recovering from a major war and social upheaval.  Gordon the main character is a drifter moving West to find a better place to live. He is a older survivor, so he knows of the times before the big war and society fell apart.  He is accosted by some locals in his travels and while planning to retrieve some of his belongings happens upon an old mail truck.  Here he realizes that the world fell apart a bit differently than he supposed and in acquiring the wardrobe of the hapless dead postman, he has taken on the mantle of that title.<br />HOW HOPE CAN BE GROWN:<br />The rest of the story is how Gordon continues his travels from town to town and the saga of the postman is begun.  Some of it is driven by its own momentum.  Some of it is driven by Gordon's imagination.  Mostly it is interesting how a theory can help hope form and become self perpetuating. Here the Postman becomes the icon of a world that is gone.

Well, Elissa is one of those. She comes from a family that suffers the details and the details exact their suffering on them.  Too many family dinners are ruined because things are not just so, or someone said something out of turn.  Elissa however, has taken this to a fine art.<br />YOU CAN'T ESCAPE WHO YOU ARE<br />Elissa moves away from her family to isolate herself from the dirty aspect of family poilitics.  Maybe to retain her emotional purity.  Ironically, she is an attorney, a profession that exacting of phrase and detail, but the underlying aspects are less than pure at times.  She is technically brilliant and exacting in her practice and utterly disdainful of office politics.  This of course, as we all know doesn't get you out of the fray as Elissa intends but allows you to become victimized by it.  Of course it does in a very obvious and painful way.<br />A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP DIES A SLOW PAINFUL EXACTING DEATH<br />Elissa meets Warren a go-getter that admires her and in many ways is as fussy as she is, except has his feet are planted firmly on the ground.  Elissa's sense of \\"purity\\" and high mindedness based in a fairy tale sense of how the world should be, finally drives him away.  However, it gets so her intent is not so much on purity but almost begins to seem like \\"oppositional behavior disorder\\" where she cannot possibly do anything anyone else wants because that could be construed as manipulation.  I found some of the conversations incredibly repetitive and tiring... Why didn't he leave sooner???<br />A BIT DISAPPOINTING<br />This book is long on dialogue and on detail.  Too much so.  The point is lost in this.  We never really see Elissa go anywhere and sometimes we get lost in the details and never trully understand what her intentions are.  But, then, she has no idea either.ully understand what her intentions are.  But, then, she has no idea either.	2002-09-09

However, don't stop there.  The different flavor of this book makes it worth pursuing in addition to the Artist's way.  I went through the Artist's way book and then took a 4 week hiatus and then jumped into this one.  I have been doing morning pages for over 6 months now.  They have value to me, even more than the 45 minutes of sleep, I give up each day for them<br />This book is strongly geared toward the working world.  As with the Artist's way book morning pages and time-outs are necessary to help you work through these and other issues.  In addition this book is arranged in a similar weekly sequence with excercises and a weekly check in.<br />PUTS THE PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH IN PERSPECTIVE:<br />This book unlike the Artist's way, deals with personal interaction not just personal creativity.  Let's face it we all work with people and how we relate to them does influence our ability to get the job done.<br />As the Artist's way does, it also recognizes there are certain people (crazy makers) that complicate our lives, there are also personality types and roles we all play in any interaction.  This book gives great tips on how to recognize these and work with them.<br />IDENTIFIES WHAT MIGHT BE SLOWING YOU DOWN AT WORK:<br />Similarly, with working with people, we have priorities to adjust and readjust.  If we are stuck in a point in our career, maybe these need adjusting.  This book if you objectively do the exercises helps us understand where some or road blocks might be.<br />Sometimes we are the road block.<br />IN GENERAL LIKE THE ARTIST'S WAY, THIS BOOK LEADS YOU TO EXAMINE YOUR LIFE<br />For the most part the Artist's way presses the reader to examine what they want out of life and how they can get there.  Also it helps you to understand what your true desires are, not just what you think you want.<br />LIKE THE ARTIST'S WAY, THERE ARE QUOTES TO PONDER IN THE MARGINS<br />It is a small thing but like the Artist's way there are quotes in the margins from famous people.  It makes you think the confusing path we are all on, is one many have taken.  Some of the quotes really connect.<br />To give you the full flavor of the book, here is the Table of Contents:<br />INTRODUCTION: Entering the gate<br />FIRST TRANSFORMATION: PART ONE: WEEK ONE: EMERGENCE<br />Morning pages/Creative Collegue/Secret Selves/Listening to the Chorus/Inner Mentor/Check-in/Creativity Contract<br />FIRST TRANSFORMATION: PART TWO: WEEK TWO: THE ROAR OF AWAKENING<br />Timeout/The Dialogue/Archaeology, Round One/Archaeology, Round Two/The Us and Them list/Imaginary Lives/Affirmations and Blurts/Customized Affirmations/Dumping the Albatross/Walking your Wisdom/Check-in<br />SECOND TRANSFORMATION: PART ONE: WEEK THREE: SOARING<br />Secrets/Watching the rapids/Wish list/Leadership Quiz/Explore a sacred space/Secretly I'd like to.../Watch the picture, without the sound/Filling the form/Check-in<br />THIRD TRANSFORMATION: PART ONE: WEEK FOUR: THE ABYSS<br />Admitting our emotions/Anger as a map/Metabolism/Footholds for optimism/Countering our Critics/True confessions/Define your inner wall/Workaholism Quiz/Bottom line/Signposts/The Fraudian Slip/Check-in<br />THIRD TRANSFORMATION: PART TWO: WEEK FIVE: SURVIVING THE ABYSS<br />Personal accounting/Emotional solvency/Counting/Luxury/Lapping up Luxury/Nasty Rules/The dream account/Explore your feelings about God/Going to take a miracle/Wondering/Check-in<br />FOURTH TRANSFORMATION: WEEK SIX: THE PEARL OF WISDOM<br />Body English/At the wheel of a new machine/A letter to the self/Positive/Negative poles/Media Deprivation/Reconnecting the Dots: Detective work/Beyond price/Meeting the inner rebel/Check-in<br />FIFTH TRANSFORMATION: WEEK SEVEN: LEARNING (AND TEACHING)<br />Being a Beginner/The jealousy map/Creativity Quiz/Feel, Think, Wish/Getting Current/The Hidden Resume/Becoming right sized/Taking note/Nuturing nutrients/The forest environment/Check-in<br />SIXTH TRANSFORMATION: WEEK EIGHT: TEACHING (AND LEARNING)<br />Roles, Biosketches, Family Functions, Containment, The power dance, Unmasking, Machiavelli, Practicing the present, Mentor magic, Going sane, \\"Dear Boss\\", Stopping the Spiral, Releasing Resentments, Check-in<br />SEVENTH TRANSFORMATION: WEEK NINE: OWNING OUR AMBITION<br />Clearing fear, Contacting Clark Kent, Local color, The resentment resume, Blasting through blocks, Succeeding with Success, Framing our lives, Check-in<br />EIGHTH TRANSFORMATION: WEEK TEN: LIVING WITH PASSION<br />Positive Inventory, Laugh or Lament, Box Seats, Heartbreak Hotel-Loss as a Lesson, The net of nurturing, Check-in<br />NINTH TRANSFORMATION: PART ONE: WEEK ELEVEN: THE LEDGE OF AUTHENTICITY<br />Name your poison, Creative U-turns, Ten-minute time outs, Valuing our values, The Ledge of authenticity, Exercising our options, Creativity center, Choose a spirit mentor, Spirit Mentors, Check-in.<br />NINTH TRANSFORMATION: PART TWO: WEEK TWELVE: RESTING IN AUTHENTICITY<br />Trusting trust, Mining our mystery, Building a house, Suceeding at success, Playing at play, Every picture tells a story, Gratitude, Checkin.<br />Epilogue<br />Suggested Reading<br />Acknowledgements<br />How to reach us<br />IndexSFORMATION: WEEK EIGHT: TEACHING (AND LEARNING)<BR>Roles, Biosketches, Family Functions, Containment, The power dance, Unmasking, Machiavelli, Practicing the present, Mentor magic, Going sane, \\"Dear Boss\\", Stopping the Spiral, Releasing Resentments, Check-in<br />SEVENTH TRANSFORMATION: WEEK NINE: OWNING OUR AMBITION<BR>Clearing fear, Contacting Clark Kent, Local color, The resentment resume, Blasting through blocks, Succeeding with Success, Framing our lives, Check-in<br />EIGHTH TRANSFORMATION: WEEK TEN: LIVING WITH PASSION<BR>Positive Inventory, Laugh or Lament, Box Seats, Heartbreak Hotel-Loss as a Lesson, The net of nurturing, Check-in<br />NINTH TRANSFORMATION: PART ONE: WEEK ELEVEN: THE LEDGE OF AUTHENTICITY<BR>Name your poison, Creative U-turns, Ten-minute time outs, Valuing our values, The Ledge of authenticity, Exercising our options, Creativity center, Choose a spirit mentor, Spirit Mentors, Check-in.<br />NINTH TRANSFORMATION: PART TWO: WEEK TWELVE: RESTING IN AUTHENTICITY<BR>Trusting trust, Mining our mystery, Building a house, Suceeding at success, Playing at play, Every picture tells a story, Gratitude, Checkin.<br />Epilogue<BR>Suggested Reading<BR>Acknowledgements<BR>How to reach us<BR>Index	2002-07-04
US	50791141	R1DK442EE9N4M9	0971386757	34384164	Your Love Life and Reincarnation: Why The Past Is Affecting Your Present and How To Fix It	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Solid relationship advice with a twist	This book has a unique concept, not just reincarnation, not just relationships, but combining the two for further understanding.<br />What was particularly interesting was asking the reader and/or patients to suspend believe, just for a moment to go with the flow.  If you think about it, how many of us know why or how are computer works, but none of us question that it does.  This is not a unique concept if you think about.  Given that, the author gives some really solid interesting information and advice when it comes to relationships. Some of it is pure common sense, some shows a unique insight into the psyche.<br />This book is divided into several sections.<br />SECTION I:<br />What you need to know about Reincarnation, Karma and Regression therapy.  This section gives you the basics of these concepts.  If you are a disbeliever in these concepts, this section may not interest you so much, but it is worth reading.  It would give you a the background of the of the terminology referenced later on.  If you are less skeptical, there is some solid refresher information here.<br />SECTION II<br />Exploring love lives through regression therapy.  I felt, even if a person had difficulty with the concept of reincarnation, there was some solid concepts here.  The references to the various relationship problems were dead-on and the specific examples of people's situations offered an insight to some concerns many people have.  The examples were particularly useful because by looking at the dynamics of another's relationship versus descriptions of problems really helped to characterize the issues discussed.<br />This section dealt with why some people are still single, Love or lust at first sight, reoccuring negative relationships, lack of commitment, abandonment issues and starting with your own regard for yourself before you look to others for love.<br />SECTION III<br />Sexuality and past lives.  Given today's hot topics and issues on the various forms of sexuality, I felt this went a long way to help begin an understanding of why people may act the way they do.  Even if this is not a topic you may personally be interested in, it may help you to understand others around you.  It is rare today that you don't at least know someone that has struggled with these issues.  Case histories in this section also personalize these issues for the reader.<br />SECTION IV<br />Dealing with other relationship issues. This section deals with commitment issue from leaving, the timing of leaving, peaceful breakups and commitments.  Let's face it all relationships either end or continue.  It is all covered here.  Additionally, there are several sections that deal with non-monogamous relationships and the issues associated.  This is about the only book I have ever read that covered this issue.  I'll be honest if this is a consideration for you and your significant other, there are some reasonable guidelines here.  Case histories also abound in this section as well.  From the peaceful breakup to the uncommon relationship.  What I particularly liked about this section were the steps in the commitment process.  There were 6 sections: Children, Money, Sex, Monogamy, Relatives and Other.  This should be required reading for all those considering marriage.  Couples actually sitting down and talking over these issues prior to marriage could put many divorce attorneys out of business.  Also it emphasized that people grow and change in their relationships.  Bingo.  Many people don't ever consider that.  It can't be emphasized enough and this is the first book I've read that considered this and suggested couples prepare for this.<br />SECTION V<br />Discover, forgive and release.  Even within working relationships, sometimes there are blocks to intimacy and less than full communication between partners.  This section helps you work to dissolve these issues through meditation and regression.<br />There are a number of meditation exercises and scripts for you to work with.  Also there is a script for self regression.  I haven't tried these yet but I plan to.  This section is chock full of great ideas.<br />SECTION V1<br />Other resources to improve your love life.  This section covers Numerology, its relationship to reincarnation, and gives a beginning method to calculate your own numbers.  Some emphasis was also provided on Astrology too.  Along with this was a comprehesive discussion of dating services and what to expect.  I would say the author has very high standards for dating services and you would be wise to follow them, if you spend your hard earned money there.  This is a great idea, because most of us have no clue where to start or what to expect.  He also provides some dating hints and ideas.  As much as this might seem basic, many of us, have no clue.  This section is chock full of ideas from the spritual to the practical and they all flow together in a very comprehensive summary.  I found this section to be very interesting.<br />What was very interesting in the end, the author addresses the skeptics as well.  Let's face it.  Some of this may be a stretch for some, and for others may make perfect sense.  As was commented in Ian Stevensons' book Old Souls.  In the eastern world Reincarnation is consider as a fact for many religions and no proof is necessary.  In the western world Reincarnation is not considered as possible, and no proof is enough.  Hence very little research is funded or has been done to bring this to light, as one considers it unecessary and the other a waste of time.  Even if you are not ready to take a leap of faith and consider this your first and only life, this book has solid relationship information, I have not seen duplicated elsewhere.k with.

Not only does she give you good advice she also gives it succinctly.<br />One neat way to read this book is a &quot;hint&quot; per day.  Then this little book will take you 100 days to read.  You will also internalize some of the messages so much better as well.  The odd thing about when you do this, sometimes you hit a particularly pertinent hint on the day you need it.<br />This book is separated in 6 sections and includes a reading list.  I especially like books that include reading lists as they help guide you to similarly minded books.<br />The six sections are:<br />1. Things you'll want to do: General ideas for getting in touch with yourself.<br />2. Easy things to think about doing: Ideas to help you become aware of how to simplify.<br />3. More difficult things to think about doing: Some real hard steps to pare down.  Some of these might be pretty difficult for some.<br />4.The hard stuff: Well, this is the emotional housecleaning part. Some times our heads are full.<br />5. Some fun stuff: Cool ideas and further tools to try.<br />All in all a very jam packed useful little book.	2002-06-20

The Eberhardt family is made up of Lainey the mom, a stay at home Mom of the late 40's, her husband David a psychologist, a doctor in a field just beginning to be understood and their six children  Their children were conceived in two groups.  The two oldest before their autistic son and the 3 youngest after.  Six in a family that was divided by this one autistic child.<br />SEVERAL VOICES PAINT DIFFERENT PICTURES:<br />The four voices you hear in this book are that of the Mom, Dad, eldest son Mack born before their autistic son Randall, and their second oldest daughter Nina born after.  In this family, birth order is everything.  Sue Miller's magnificent writing portrays how different a home can be from different eyes. Randall is the focus point and from him the whole family pivots.  It is amazing how much one person can affect an entire family.<br />STORY IS TOLD THROUGH RECOLLECTION OF SIMPLE EVENTS, THE ONES THAT SHAPE LIVES<br />Sue Miller's vivid writing makes you feel what her characters are experiencing as they recall these events in their lives.  Remember times when you felt your life just changed or when a routine defined you?  It can be a simple thing, but it signals to you that all things in your life had just changed or just a little bit about you was revealed, that you didn't even know.  That simple moment, when you felt like a grown-up, one with decisions to make, responsibilities to act on.  That moment when something you never noticed before became significant.  All these factors build a life.  In this book you can see how these individual factors seen from different eyes can mean so little or so much.<br />A SIMPLE STORY<br />This book has no profound insight or sweeping moment when the characters get on with their life in a different fashion, but it does show how events shape each person differently.  It is a simple story of a family and the events that shaped their lives.  It makes us all think about the big and little things we recall as a kid.  Given an adult perspective they take on all new meanings.  Toss in a different perspective and they are more different still.  When you read this book you think a bit differently of your parents and your children and their lives in respect to you.<br />Great writing, a simple story of complicated lives.kes us all think about the big and little things we recall as a kid.

I'm a bit out of the loop on new Sci-fi writers, so I did not know how prodigious David Brin's work was when I bought one of his books at a conference where he was a keynote speaker.(CHI 2002).  What a pleasant surprise I had, when I realized this guy is really good.<br />BASIC IDEA:<br />Kiln people starts from a basic premise.  You can live out multiple lives by animating clay duplicates using your &quot;Standing wave&quot; or soul to imprint on them.  These clay dolls can only live a day.  However, at the end of the day, they come back to you and give you their memories before they dissolve.  This way you can live multiple lives for each day.  Cool idea.<br />CLAY PEOPLE ONLY LIVE A DAY, SO HAVE NO RIGHTS:<br />Society of course is not perfect but by now has settled into lives built around these clay duplicates or &quot;dittos&quot; as they are called.  Society's infrastructure has built-in expectations of using these clay dolls to do all a real persons tedious tasks.  You know like work and house-cleaning.  The lifespan of these dittos is too short to consider them separately from their archetype or original person.  Technically, they are owned.  Also imprinting is limited from one original person to their ditto and back again. You can't trade memories.  Standing waves that set the framework for &quot;ditto-ing&quot; are too unique to swap.<br />DITTO TECHNOLOGY IS A FOUNDATION OF THAT SOCIETY:<br />Ditto technology has settled into the status quo.  Lives and fortunes are built around that premise.  Of course in any society there is always an urge to change, to evolve further, but then there is always costs involved.  On top of that what is evolution, longer ditto lifespans, ditto to ditto copying, swapping memories, virtual immortality?  The possibilities are endless when you are only dreaming.  But, maybe some work toward those dreams has begun.  If ditto technology ripped society apart when it came on the scene; what would the next development bring and who would make that first step?<br />THE MAIN CHARACTER IN KILN PEOPLE: ALBERT MORRIS IS A PRIVATE DETECTIVE:<br />Albert Morris investigates the crimes of the day, illegal ditto copies, stolen technology, etc.  He's a two-bit private investigator that makes his living keep things legal.  He too uses the ditto technology of the day to get things done.<br />AUTHOR CREATES INCREDIBLE FRAMEWORK TO SUPPORT THIS WORLD:<br />What truly  amazed me in the book is the author's ability to create an entire world and impart to you the reader a real gist of what this world is like, from dino-buses to what dittos can eat and the finer aspects of what color ditto can do what.  What is also interesting is the evolving language in the book.  Before long you will know what archies, frankies, roxes and rigs mean.  And it doesn't feel like a history lesson.  Really good writing.<br />ALBERT MORRIS STUBBLES ONTO SOMETHING BIG, OR DOES IT STUMBLE ONTO HIM:<br />The story evolves as Albert the main character in an investigation gets hints of a grander scheme.  He then gets hired to do some other than routine investigations that get more and more intriguing.  Is it all part of a bigger picture or separate unrelated issues?  Since he can duplicate himself, this is all happening simultaneously.  How cool can you get?<br />This book is interesting on many levels; from the idea of living multiple lives, to the intrigue and situations the private eye uncovers.  A very good book..  I think it would make a super cool movie.make that first step?<br />THE MAIN CHARACTER IN KILN PEOPLE: ALBERT MORRIS IS A PRIVATE DETECTIVE:<BR>Albert Morris investigates the crimes of the day, illegal ditto copies, stolen technology, etc.  He's a two-bit private investigator that makes his living keep things legal.

I followed with &quot;Stretching lessons&quot; and now &quot;Plain and Simple&quot;, far from the chronological order they were written in.  However, this does not matter. I wish and hope she writes more.<br />THE JOURNEY WAS BEST FOR ME, FROM DAY TO DAY<br />I find I have a tendency to read her books in small segments.  A chapter or section a day.  It feels like you are journeying with her this way.  I don't know why I did this, but it is a style all three books fell into.  Some books are like that.  In fact, I plan to reread them all, something I rarely do.  They are those kind of books.<br />FAMILIAR THOUGHTS<br />All of us have ideas that capture our imagination, from a facination with particular types of books, stories, colors, ideas.  These are part of who we are.  Rarely do most of us delve in deeper to fully pursue the things that facinate us.  Sue Bender does.<br />FOLLOWING YOUR PASSIONS<br />In this book she had been taken by a quilt she saw that was attributed to the Amish.  The artist within felt a certain resonance with this quilt each time she saw it.  Finally, she felt inclined to uproot her life, if only temporarily to examine the base of this facination; the culture of the people that made it.  We all feel this pull, this draw occassionally. Most of us never act on it.<br />REVEALS NOT ONLY THE AMISH, BUT THE AUTHOR AND THE READER AS WELL<br />What is particularly gratifying in this book is that not only does she reveal a portion of Amish life, but also her own.  You see the author's perspective and her own preconceived notions of what and who the Amish are.  She doesn't just visit the Amish once but lives with them at two different times with two different families.  Here you can see, they as any other group of people have their own diversity and conflict.  But, more so than any other group, due to their exclusivity, there are the tenets by which they live.<br />As all anthropologists that study a culture must quickly find out, when we take time, to truly understand others, their motiviations, what they find important, how they live, only then do we find ourselves.<br />Sue Bender is still looking, but she is a lot closer than most.ther group, due to their exclusivity, there are the tenets by which they live.<br />As all anthropologists that study a culture must quickly find out, when we take time, to truly understand others, their motiviations, what they find important, how they live, only then do we find ourselves.<br />Sue Bender is still looking, but she is a lot closer than most.	2002-05-08

It is oddly written, but it is one of the best written books I've seen in a while.<br />STORY LINE:<br />Both of the author's parents die of cancer within a short period of time from each other and he winds up raising his younger brother.  His father was a difficult man who when he drank became even more difficult.  Understandably, then his relationship with his son was testy at best.  So his passing left some unfinished business.<br />The basis of the book is the time after the parents deaths when the author moves from Chicago to California and settles in with caring for his younger brother.<br />WHAT MAKES IT SO INTERESTING:<br />Unlike most stories that deal with a linear progression of events, the author does not deal with the death of his parents in one single display at the beginning of the book.  Instead, he gives the barest of details and gets on with his life raising his brother.  However, in bits and pieces throughout the book he describes things that trigger memories of his parents and their heartbreaking demise.  In many ways this is the way a person would deal with the enormous impact of these events.  First just picking up the pieces and then getting on with life and then hashing it all out later.<br />Also like any one out on their own for the first time, he relates bits and pieces of that experience as well.  Included in with this is a fledgling effort at creating a magazine.<br />WRITING WAS MAGNIFICENT:<br />What I found particularly good was the relating of conversations and events.  The detail was just the right amount and the emotions so easy to relate to.  Pouring his mother's ashes in the ocean and remembering when she was last at a beach was an interweaving that was very well done.  His description of dealing with handling the ashes and the emotional impact was right on the nose.  Even though some comversations got a little weird at the end, his attention to detail and handling of this was excellent to read.<br />As a new author his writing was stunning in its style.  I'm looking forward to more from him.ew author his writing was stunning in its style.  I'm looking forward to more from him.	2002-04-16

A friend of mine recommended him as a writer years ago, and I have been hooked.  Oddly enough in High school in the US, only recently have I heard of his books as required reading and then only \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\".  I consider his work superior to Hemingway.  To me his books are a genuine recreation of that time. (No, I don't really know, but he makes you feel like you are there).<br />DRINKING AND SMOKING ARE MAJOR SYMBOLS IN THIS AND IN MOST OF REMARQUE'S BOOK<br />One thing that struck me in this book and many others of Remarque's is how much drinking and smoking plays a part of the symbolism.  They are props for the characters, in much as they were in real life at the time; drinking and the requisite cigarette to think with.  To most American's, born in the last 50 years, this is the major anachronism in the book, the incredible role drinking and smoking play in people's lives.  To people I know from Europe, this would not be as much of a surprise.  The US non-smoking and drinking in moderation have not yet reached Europe yet.  The drinking and smoking by any means, do not detract from the main story.  This is a mature romance that captures your imagination none-the-less.  I wonder what the props for this century will be; Maybe our cell phones and laptops?<br />MAIN CHARACTERS ARE ALL REFUGEES IN FRANCE<br />The main character is a refugee from Germany, a former well-known surgeon, forbidden to operate in France due to his questionable residency status.  He moonlights by doing another surgeon's work.  He is a haunted man, by both his past persecution in Germany and his unstable status in France.  Hardly is this a good basis for a romantic situation that leads beyond living for the day.<br />RELATIONSHIP WAS NOT SO MUCH PURSUED BUT ONE OF OPPORTUNITY<br />He meets and helps the woman he is to fall in love with, under peculiar circumstances. He helps her with no intention to see her again. Time passes and he runs into her again.  They fall into a peculiar relationship that uses &quot;Calvados&quot; an apple brandy as its symbol.  For some reason this drink is frequently mentioned in books of the time.  If it were now, I would say it was paid advertising.<br />ONE ODD TWIST<br />Only one twist and it is a major one in the story makes no sense to me, why it is included.  I might be missing something, but the discovery and fate of the German officer, seems tacked on, added as an afterthought.  If you read this story, let me know what you think.  I don't see it is so much as part of the same thread, unless it is one of relationships concluded.<br />BASIC STORY<br />So as not to ruin the story, I will allude to the fact that the relationship develops and the hostilities of the times, intrude, both outside France and within.  These events affect the relationship and the way it changes illustrates the characters of the people involved.  The main character you follow with his observation of the things and people around him. You see his girl friend through his eyes and his Russian friend's eyes only.  This is enough they are shrewd observers.  It is apparent from this observation from day one that the events that eventually unfold were bound to happen.<br />As usual Remarque weaves a compelling and complete story.he runs into her again.

DOES IT WORK, DOES IT CHANGE YOUR LIFE?<br />Has it?  Well Yes and no.<br />I'm not putting out massive works of art or prose, nor am I comfortable with even the pencil sketches I do. However, I am doing them again.  I've had fits and starts of drawing, but this book does help you put that into perspective.  You are a beginner and it is okay for your work to look like a beginners.  Simple concept.  Hard to internalize.<br />INTERESTING OUTCOME.<br />What I did find and others who use this program can probably confirm is that it helps get situations out in the open.  Family stuff.  When you do the morning pages, you ramble.  You put down all that trash you are thinking and then you find you work to clean it up.  You know all the stuff your kids, your spouse, your co-workers do, that really tick you off.  You find you start to address that.  Kind of a neat by-product.<br />MORNING PAGES ARE NOT SO BAD:<br />My first take on this, is dedicate a half an hour of my precious and sparse sleeping time.....?  What are you nuts?  Then I tried it.  You have a clarity (and a drowsiness) in the AM, that is unmatchable any other time.  Also, if you are like me get a whole lot less interruptions.  I did the morning pages from 5:15 till 6:00 AM weekdays and after I got up on weekends.  Weekends, sometimes I didn't get to them until afternoon.  But, each day (except for 1 day in 12 weeks) they were religiously done.<br />Guess what?  I'm hooked.  I'm continuing and you might too.  Consider this as a book (a life), you are writing, you are directing.  What a concept!<br />MORNING PAGES LENGTH:<br />With the Artist's way book, I bought the journal.  These 3 pages were the size of 8-1/2 X 11 pages.  3 pages do not take you 1/2 hour but more like 45 minutes to an hour.  Get ready for that.  It seems like a lot some days and not enough on others.  You don't need a special book to do this in either.  I bought a spiral notebook to pick up where the journal left off, when it was full.  The journal is nice though as it has passages from the book on each page.<br />ARTISTS DATES:<br />I found that some of the timing of the artist dates were bad.  I'm sure most others will run into this as well.  I did this book through the Thanksgiving, Christmas holiday.  Artist's dates were often dropped and sometimes one did double-duty.  However, these can be very simple.  You have to make them what is important to you and that is the point of the book. It makes you feel special.  I think all of us wait for others to make us feel special.  Most of us could wait a very long time.  Little do we realize, we have to set the standard.  Make ourselves feel special.  Because we are.  We have to appeal to the artist within us.  It can be simple or extravagant.  One thing I like is pens with a 1.0mm tip.  They use ink like crazy, but what a wonderful broad stroke they make on the paper.  That is one of my \\"perks\\".<br />SOME CRITIQUE:<br />In the past years you've no doubt heard of people coming out of therapy accusing their parents of abuse.  Many of these people were suggested into this practice by psychologists looking for a quick solution to some of their patient's psychoses.  What I didn't care for in the book, is that some of the tasks appeared to be excercising these same demons. Trying to find devils in the details of past \\"creative blocks\\". Some times these blocks are cumulative and not one earth-shattering event.  Like water on a rock.  Sometimes the people around you were highly supportive, etc. etc.<br />We all have a mix of that. I felt however, that this negative aspect was overemphasized.  A person sensitive to these suggestions could walk away very convinced that there was a horrible trauma they just can't quite remember.<br />WEEK OFF OF READING TRULY IS IMPOSSIBLEIN SOME PEOPLE'S LIVES:<br />One week was supposed to be one free from reading.  I used it as a media free week (Radio, TV, magazines, newspapers, books and non-work email) and not from work related reading.  If I neglected the reading in my job, I would have over 300 emails, very job related languishing in my in-box.  I also would not be doing my job in writing specifications.  Not possible in my job and not realistic in many others I'm sure.  I think the author should just emphasize the noise factor or suggest doing this type of exercise on vacation.<br />In summary this book and its tasks were excellent and I can't recommend it highly enough.  I'm going on to her book on Work creativity next, then the Right to Write and the Vein of Gold.<br />KEEP UP THE MORNING PAGES AND CHANGE THE WORLD - ONE PERSON AT A TIME!LE'S LIVES:<br />One week was supposed to be one free from reading.

In fact, if you are not doing this, I'm not sure what else you would use this book for.<br />I gave it a 4 only because the number of pages for each week were off and it was an awkward book to write in.  Other than that it was great.<br />GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT THE AUTHOR INTENDED FOR 3 PAGES OF WRITING<br />When you do the Artist's way journaling, it states you should do 3 pages of writing per day.  This book gives you a sense of what the author meant as 3 pages.  By the way 3 pages this size took me not the 15-30 minutes the author implied, but more like 45 minutes to 1 hour.  It could also be the morning grogginess too.<br />I get up at 5:15AM to do these.<br />NOT ENOUGH PAGES FOR EACH WEEK PLUS A CHECK-IN:<br />As this book is by the same author that did the Artist way 12-week program, I am surprised that the number of pages provided did not meet the authors requirement.  Per week you should have at least 21 pages and then 1-2 pages for a weekly check in. I found that I often wrote into the following week though I never wrote over 3 pages/day nor more than a 1 page per check in.  23 pages per week should be what the author provided as a minimum.<br />BOUND-BACK MADE IT AWKWARD TO WRITE AT TIMES:<br />This book would be better as a spiral bound book, so that you could fold back the areas you did not need.  At times in the AM, it was all I could do to write much less trying to hold the book open.<br />INSPIRATIONAL SAYINGS EACH DAY PERTAINING TO THAT WEEK WAS NICE:<br />The author paraphrazed the Artist's way book providing page numbers as well, each day.  That was nice. It often helped to get my writing jumpstarted.<br />SUGGESTION TO THE AUTHOR:<br />As you recommend to your readers to continue the morning pages a follow on set of books would be handy with the same type of inspirational phrases each day. Buying this book again with the unmatched set of pages and difficulty to hold open, does not appeal to me.<br />This program is a good one and I plan to continue the morning pages.  It is a very useful thinking practice.eal to me.<br />This program is a good one and I plan to continue the morning pages.  It is a very useful thinking practice.	2002-01-29

His excellent writing shines in bits and pieces but on a whole this book is too vague and stilted for my preferences.<br />A WANDERING STORY<br />This vague and wandering story may very well have been a creation to illustrate the odd state of mind Dr. Selzer found himself in once he woke from his coma and 10 minute death episode.  He at times thought he was in a monastery, on the Nile and in other exotic locales.  At any point in time, also thinking that the nursing staff were conspiring to keep him from his freedom.<br />HIS SIDELINE STORY OF A FAMOUS AUTHOR'S BRUSH WITH BREAST REMOVAL SURGERY, PRIOR TO ANESTHESIA MAKES FOR TERRIFYING READING<br />Some reviewers suggested this was an artifice added to increase the page count.  I'll be honest, this was an excellent portion of the book preparing the reader to realize that writing about your own illness is bound to portray you as a victim or a hero.  Nothing in between. It is interesting that Dr. Selzer included this and adds to the book.  I'm also happy to have been born after the use of anesthesia.<br />TOO MANY SHIFTS TO KEEP MY INTEREST<br />He does an excellent job of describing himself in the 3rd person, however, the switches of storyline from paragraph to paragraph, I found hard to keep my interest.  Sometimes a artistic device gets in the way of the story.  I found his forays into his imaginary worlds a bit to artful at time.  It is one thing to be literary, it is another to outreach most of your audience.  Either that or I'm not too bright.  Both are possible.<br />HAS RICHARD SELZER'S SIGNATURE EXCELLENT CAPTURE OF DETAIL:<br />As usual each section is excellent in its attention to detail. (I don't think I will ever look at tulips the same). Also, he gives you a feel for the wandering mind grasping to make sense of all that has happened. He pieces together odd sections of facts and changes a broken pot into a horse in his reconstruction of events.  These perceptions alone can make for an odd reality.<br />CAREGIVERS WERE WELL CHARACTERIZED AND WELL AFTER THE FACT APPRECIATED<br />His portrait of his caregivers is well done from the nurse from Troy to the lyrical Irishman that tended to him.  He also portrays himself (Accurately I'm sure) as the crabby patient he was.  Doctors make the worse patients.<br />An interesting book.f events.

Please do not misunderstand this.  He also does Ian Stevenson's dedication justice.  This is a true stoic dedicated to his science.  However, I did find there was more detail about the process than the end product, proof or disproof, or hintings of reincarnation.  There was detailed descriptions of the conditions of buildings and conditions in Lebanon, of the translated conversations, of the squalor and din of India and of the abject poverty of the people.  However, I felt a major lack of discussion of the protocol that was attempted (or not attempted, field work is an inexact science).  I also found little explanation for some of the theory to date.  I don't understand the significance of birthmarks.  I can understand the curiousity factor, but hardly see this as hard scientific proof.<br />THE BOOK IS ARRANGED BY LOCATION:<br />The book discusses the individual cases grouped chronologically, what was investigated each day and where. For this reason, there is a Beirut, India and US section.  I was unimpressed with the consistency of the questions (given that we had so many details on the conversations) and the rigor, this does not do Ian Stevenson any justice and may make him look less than professional.  I do understand where these things could go by the way side, but it seems they were dispensed with upfront.  Maybe Tom Shroder did not want to make the book overly heavy with the science of the investigations.  This was particularly light with Tom Shroder's handling of the US case, that Stevenson could not. It was more of a curiosity seeker's description, than an investigative report. Ironically though, there was more than a page and a half describing the parents drive for success and details of their business and health problems.  Then he said their identities were being concealed.  So either this revealed more than the subject preferred or was pure fabrication?  I understand where the writer wanted to assure the reader of the believability of the parents and the uniqueness of the child's birth, but this was a bit too detailed.  This book suffered from too much detail in some areas and not enough in others.  For this the editor of this book takes equal responsibility.<br />THIS BOOK GAVE AN EXCELLENT ACCOUNTING OF THE FRUSTRATIONS WITH INFORMATION GATHERING:<br />One thing this book did was give a face and a sense to the number of people and trials it takes to get this type of information.  Also the dogged hard work.  Wow! Assuming progress, one can only imagine the hardships that Dr. Ian Stevenson ran into on his previous visits to India and Beirut.<br />AN INTERESTING POINT OF VIEW WAS BROUGHT UP BY THE AUTHOR:<br />In the the countries of Lebanon and India with the groups being interviewed, reincarnation is a part of their beliefs.  It is a given in their eyes and they feel it does not need to be proven. It is welcome when it happens.  Here in the West it is considered mumbo-jumbo and to try to prove it is considered ridiculous, a waste of money that could go to hard science.  Not a situation a scientist would like to be in.  This is a Catch 22 type of situation.  Kind of like trying to prove the Earth was round some years ago. Sheer heresy.<br />THE AUTHOR ALSO MADE A VERY GOOD POINT AT THE END:<br />When you are scientist trying to prove a theory from the outputs only, it can be like a 2-dimensional creature trying to perceive a 3-dimensional object.  We humans are like that, we can understand and put our heads around 3-dimensional objects and understand them.  But, if you consider time as a 4th dimension, we are not trully equipped.  Great analogy.  We are not reallyseeing the big picture and may physically not be able to.  We need to understand first our relationship with time and all the other facets that lead up to reincarnation before we can truly understand it.<br />IN SUMMARY:<br />This book was good, if you wanted to see the day-to-day fact gathering.  Also I think it pointed out interesting observations of the different ways of lives in other countries.  I'm not being sly when I suggest Tom Shroder would do an excellent job writing a travelogue.  I enjoyed that part quite a bit.  He took the physical risks I'm not willing to, to describe the experiences of going to these places.  He did a great job describing them.<br />I do wish this book had more fundamental points and science in it.  I think to get that you really need Dr. Stevenson's publications.  However, Mr. Shroder is an excellent writer recounting details and a laymen's view point of some of the facts he was observing. It is the way most of us would see it.<br />I gave it a 4 because I was expecting a bit more scientific book.<br />From the account on back cover, I was expecting this.<br />It received a 4 because it was excellently written.<br />I will watch for books from Tom Shroder again.he big picture and may physically not be able to.

This book must be the origin of some of the stories that wound up in Doctor Stories (Imelda, Impostor, Chatterbox)<br />MOSTLY THE LIFE OF A DOCTOR IN PRACTICE OF SURGERY (70% OF BOOK)<br />Unlike Doctor Stories which have a wider range of stories, this book except for a couple of sidelines is about the craft of the Doctor, in and out of the Operating room and Hospital. Also, the doctor's perspective on the outside world.  However, I wonder how many other doctors have his sense of service.  Some of us can't imagine a high-priced surgeon performing the service he does in &quot;Toe nails&quot; one of the stories within.<br />DETAILS AND THE EMOTIONS AROUND THEM, FILL THIS BOOK:<br />Richard Selzer writing is poetic in his description of a doctor's musings on the Art of Surgery, the halls of the hospitals and the feel of working inside the human body.  In many sense his reflections on his relationships with the tools he uses could the same a mechanic, a draftsman (of the 50s-80s), or the artist feels about the tools they use to perform their craft.<br />POETIC DETAILS ON EVEN THE MOST ORDINARY SITUATION:<br />He finds beauty in the minute details of life and has the gift to write about them.  I also have his book &quot;Mortal Lessons&quot; that I hope to read soon as well.  His books are addicting in the sense that you too also begin, if you don't already, to see the details of your own work and the relationships you have with the world around you.  Either I think similarly or his thought process is universal, but he captures the magic of living and the impressions we all have at time. Even if you are not a doctor (and I'm not), you will find a sense of familiarity in his writing.<br />MEDICINE MAY BE WHAT HAS FINE-TUNED HIS SENSES:<br />Medicine however, has a draw that few other crafts do. It is the mystery of our own plumbing.  It also has the human element of relationships and drama within it as well.  The author does well to capture the patient's relationship with the physician. Richard Selzer does well to capture the detached relationship; a physician has with the body but not the soul of the patients, he treats.  When he acknowledges the person within the body the relationship broadens and he as a physician has opened himself up to the pain as well.  He does this from time to time.<br />ZEN-LIKE IN THOUGHT:<br />I found this book very Zen-like in its concentration of detail.  If Richard Selzer decides to write a book like &quot;Sweeping Changes&quot; a book on Zen philosophy on cleaning, but except on the art of living, he would be well-qualified.  He makes holy what many take to be ordinary. Bravo.ma within it as well.  The author does well to capture the patient's relationship with the physician.

US	50791141	R1YKT0MOHMK6AL	0684844818	883427952	Intrusions	Books	5	3	3	N	N	What a great book!	This being my 5th Ursula Hegi book, I'm a bit biased.  Ironically,it was the first I purchased.<br />Having read one chapter of this book I realized I liked the author's thought process and went out and bought her earlier works.  Then I read them first.  Odd, but there it is.<br />MANY VOICES:<br />This is a most unusual book.  Not so much in the sense that the author addresses the reader and discusses plot lines and possiblities but that she also chronicles the &quot;intrusions&quot; of her own life into the writing process.  As a Mom of teenagers, I remember the days of being thankful to go to work to eat lunch in peace.  This is why young moms eat alone when given the opporturnity... But, I digress.  Needless to say it is very much as story about Moms with young children trying to remember who they were before the kids.<br />YOU GET CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FROM ALL DIRECTIONS:<br />Not only do you get character development for the characters by Ms. Hegi, the characters pitch in as well.  It is an interesting dialogue when a character is arguing for his personality and winning.  I found this unique book treatment and the lessons within it captivating.  Anyone who has pondered their motivations and who they are can empathize with not only the characters in this book, but the author herself.<br />IF THIS WERE A MOVIE:<br />If this book were to be made into a movie, it would remind you of many of the situation dramas where multiple story lines intersect.  However, this book has alternative story lines as well and even would-be pushy alternative writers!<br />BRAVO ONCE AGAIN TO MS. HEGI:<br />You have a convert.  If you will write it, I will read it.  Once again, she fills the pages with the information we all can relate to, wonder about and notice in the corner of our mind.  A truly inspired book about an ordinary life.	2001-10-30

From the missteps to the fortune timing that made this show what it is.<br />THIS BOOK ONCE AGAIN CONTAINS JOHN EDWARD'S FRIENDLY BANTER THAT VIEWERS OF THE SHOW AND READERS OF HIS PREVIOUS BOOK WILL RECOGNIZE:<br />The style of this book is pure John Edward.  You can almost hear his Long Island accent as he recounts his frustration with the TV people he has to deal with.  What comes through loud and clear is quirky sense of humor that is so evident in the show.  He has a pleasant way of dealing with people that don't get it; when he is telling them news that isn't packaged quite the way they expected.<br />ONLY A SMALL FRACTION (30%) REALLY GETS INTO THE ART OF HIS TALENT:<br />This book thought it is all about his ability as a medium, it is primarily about the contruction of the tv show and how his particular talent played a part in making this happen.  However that aside he does discuss some situations that came up in his other book &quot;One Last Time&quot; in more detail, as well as reveal the signs his mother finally provided him. This aside, I hope he writes another book about situations that continue around the show.<br />IN THIS BOOK YOU CAN SEE HOW PERSONAL A TALENT HE HAS:<br />While reading his book you see over an over, how all-encompassing this work can be from effecting his life choices to realizing his car is missing.  This is not merely a job but a calling.  Facinating.<br />ALL IN ALL A GOOD BOOK:  This book was very interesting, but I found myself wanting more of what makes John Edward famous; his skill as a medium.  While he also shows a remarkable talent for capturing his pleasant personality in his writing, I'm afraid the foibles of the TV mechanics don't so much interest me as the personal side of his craft.  Mind you I thought it was wonderful that some of the camera men and assistants wound up with reading.  This is truly the people side of it.  I just don't like to be reminded of the marketing and merchandizing aspect of TV.<br />MANY MISTEPS<br />In the beginning of his career there were many missteps that bear no relationship to what he does.  Marketing nightmares, technical difficulties and journalist entrapments.  With so contraversial a topic as mediumship; it is a small miracle that John is the success he is today.  It does not take much to tarnish a name and some of the earlier disasters must have felt he was being railroaded into obscurity, courtesy of some marketing/merchandizing mishaps.  Don't worry John Edward, the rest of us know, journalist integrity is an oxymoron.  Very few of us out here take what we are being spoon fed as gospel.<br />ONE QUESTION:<br />This is something I'm sure John Edward has an answer to.  As a interested skeptic who reads alot on this topic of crossing over and then even past lives, is there any negativity that comes back?  People like Hitler, Mengele, etc. have all died, does their energy ever come back through mediums?  You don't hear much of this.  Has anyone reported a past life of horrible deeds?<br />I recognize in the show that John Edward has asked if a person is particularly overbearing or pushy but I have not seen any shows where a really negative person is revealed.  However, given the 11PM EST air time, I have seen the show less often than I would like to.<br />It is a great book and I'm waiting for more.with reading.  This is truly the people side of it.

Don't worry John Edward, the rest of us know, journalist integrity is an oxymoron.  Very few of us out here take what we are being spoon fed as gospel.<br />ONE QUESTION:<BR>This is something I'm sure John Edward has an answer to.  As a interested skeptic who reads alot on this topic of crossing over and then even past lives, is there any negativity that comes back?  People like Hitler, Mengele, etc. have all died, does their energy ever come back through mediums?  You don't hear much of this.  Has anyone reported a past life of horrible deeds?<BR>I recognize in the show that John Edward has asked if a person is particularly overbearing or pushy but I have not seen any shows where a really negative person is revealed.  However, given the 11PM EST air time, I have seen the show less often than I would like to.<br />It is a great book and I'm waiting for more.	2001-10-29

Wow, it's short, as it is under 100 pages and written in a larger typefont.<br />After reading the prologue and the lead in, I quickly got jaded.<br />There was a lot of selling going on.<br />However, once I read the story, about Sniff, Scurry and Hem and Haw, I found it struck a chord.  Having graduated High school in the 70s, and worked through one recession and now headed into another, I can see a parallel on how people manage their lives.<br />Some roll with the punches, &quot;Sniff and Scurry&quot;, some make the best of them &quot;Haw&quot; and some go under &quot;Hem&quot;.<br />This simple story has a message of how to deal with imposed change.  It's simplicity is its beauty.<br />Though there is a lot of hype at the beginning and some at the end, the story itself is inspired.	2001-10-09

In Ms. Delong's book she made many references to work that John Douglas' group did and cited this book many times. This book gave me further insight into how the Serial Crime unit evolved.<br />ONE THING THE BOOK DIDN'T DO, WAS EXPLAIN HOW THEY CAME UP WITH A PROFILE:<br />Many cased were cited in this book and the profiles that were tied to them. However, still after reading this book, I did not come away with an understanding on how they established that the potential culprit was early 20's, did not know the victim, drove a VW beetle (this can't be too great for sales), lived with his Mom and used to be a bed wetter. I can hypothesize, how this was derived, but the book only gives you that much. I imagine many hours of correlating details of solved crimes helps provide the statistical information, they use. This data I'm sure is also closely guarded. One thing they did state was some serial killers were quite bright and no doubt this date could be used as a blueprint to hide your identity. Thus, the need not to publish it. Ironically too many serial killers, were police buffs. All the more reason, not to share it here as well.<br />JOHN DOUGLAS COVERS MANY HIGH PROFILE CASES IN THIS BOOK BUT, IT IS MORE A BOOK ABOUT HOW THE THE SERIAL CRIME UNIT AND HOW THEY LEARNED SOME OF THE TECHNIQUES THEY USED.<br />Ironically, common sense prevails. Why not ask some of the perpetrators now that have nothing to lose and a lot of time on their hands. The unit begins interviews with some of the more nototious killers to see what their thoughts were when they committed the crimes they did. As predicted some offenders were less than candid, but even in their lies some insight was gained.<br />THE LOGIC AND STRUCTURE OF MANY SOLVED INVESTIGATIONS WAS DETAILED. Here you can see where involving this unit may be able to save precious time. From evidence gathering, questioning and staking out various locations associated with the crimes. There is a pattern we all follow. As humans, we are all creatures of habit and compulsion. Those of us driven to crime and horrible acts of violence even more so. John Douglas discusses this in many situations they dealt with.<br />IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A BOOK THAT:<br />Covers many high profile cases in broad strokes and deals with the logic behind profiling, while also<br />showing the people and the process involved in building a department devoted to this, this is the book for you.<br />BUT, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR<br />Detail case specifics and how all that profiles are generated, this is not it.<br />JOHN DOUGLAS DOES A NICE JOB WRAPPING UP THE DETAILS OF HIS LONG CAREER AND A PART OF IT HE FEEL PASSIONATE ABOUT. We should all be so lucky to have an opportunity to shape the world around us as he has. He has paid the price with health and family issues, but the outcome, I'm sure he would never change.

Ironically, though she had a excellent perception of the Japanese mentality, it was not inbred. This was her downfall.  Her understanding of the Japanese mindset, with her Western values, often put her in a mental conflict.  What was the right thing to do?  After a while it all seemed like a game with rules that she had no comprehension of.<br />DIFFERENT STRUCTURE FOR ADVANCEMENT<br />Amelie's dilema, was that she was too motivated in a culture that valued tradition from the thought that promotions and job assignments were based only on seniority versus performance.  This was not all that different than 1950's America.  However, this 1990's pseudo-Westerner, was all fired up to act in the pay for performance attitude of corporate America.  Rather than being applauded for her initiative she was severely reprimanded for her audacity..<br />WESTERNER WITH GOOD LANGUAGE SKILLS SEEN AS A FAKER:<br />Ironically, Amelie had a good understanding of Japanese culture an a excellent command of the language.  This was in fact a detriment, as since she had a Western face, she was seen as a wanna-be Asian.  This was considered insulting to the Asians around her.  She was expected to act as a foreigner, and was even told to &quot;forget&quot; that she could speak Japanese.<br />BASIC WESTERN MORALITY WAS A HAZARD:<br />Even the basic concepts of fairness and responsibility had a different meaning in Japan.  Many Western concepts of morality and responsibility were seen as very negative aspects in Japan.  Amelie often had to struggle to keep her first impulses in check, after several disastrous missteps.  Ironically, also some behavior that would get you fired in corporate America, were considered forgivable in the socialist Japanese company.<br />GREAT PERSPECTIVE, WONDER IF IT IS THE SAME TODAY, 10 YEARS LATER<br />This book had a great perspective on the traditional Japanese corporate structure.  I wonder if American/European companies based in Japan, with Japanese employees function the same today?  Would this be at all apparent to the Westerner, that does not grasp the language?<br />An excellent book for those of us that would like to better understand the Japanese working environment from an inside Westerner's perspective.fired in corporate America, were considered forgivable in the socialist Japanese company.<br />GREAT PERSPECTIVE, WONDER IF IT IS THE SAME TODAY, 10 YEARS LATER<BR>This book had a great perspective on the traditional Japanese corporate structure.

This book does a nice job of answering those questions. From a young age, John Edward, had some different psychic experiences and was raised in a household where his mother was very much into mediums. However, this by far was not the norm for his Catholic upbringing. He does a really nice job describing how this happened and how he entered into this unusual profession.<br />THROUGH VARIOUS REPEATED READINGS AND EXPERIENCES John Edward has learned to improve his skill at communicating with those who have passed over. Despite his best efforts, this included his own mother. He describes how the spirits communicate with him through symbols and sometimes not at very convenient times.<br />THIS BOOK HAS MANY EXAMPLES AND SITUATIONS WHERE HIS SKILL WAS TESTED AND HE REPEATEDLY STRESSES THAT THE SPIRITS CONTROL WHAT IS HAPPENING. This is important to note, as when people go for a reading it can be very different than they expected. This was evident in a number of the examples in his book. Also the fact that spirits may have manipulated the circumstances around a reading, shows who really is in charge. He has some wonderfully involved situations that developed where people needed help and the spirits endeavored to provide this.<br />EXCELLENT READING: John Edward does a nice job of not only describing the path he has taken and why, as well as discussing several circumstances where spirits have guide his and other's paths. He also provides in the last part of the book how you can possibly make yourself open for these experiences. Excellent reading for those curious skeptics as I am and other believers. For those strict non-believers, this is not a book about proof. Michael Schmicker's Best Evidence would be better for you.	2001-08-27

She tells us of her most interesting cases and as with all jobs some of her frustrations and most memorable moments.<br />AS A WOMAN IN A PREVIOUSLY ALL MALE DOMINATED FIELD, she does an excellent job of characterizing some of the fights she had to endure to gain a foothold in this previous bastion of white-male cohorts.  Any woman that has breached these lines can recognize some of the difficult situations you face.  From trying to be a good-sport, to drawing the line of how much she will tolerate, Candice reveals some of her struggles with trying to break this &quot;pink barrier&quot;.<br />YOU CAN SEE CANDICE HAS A BIT MORE BRAVADO THAN MANY OF US.  When I was reading this, I was only too glad, I was the reader and not living some of the situations she faced.  It takes a special person to do this type of work and it is clear when she relates her previous work as a psychiatric nurse as well as her FBI work, she has nerves of steel.  I would be running in the other direction.  I must commend those who do this type of work for protecting the rest of us chickens.  Ironic that Candice had difficulty with a flight in small plane.  It is interesting how the mind works.<br />MANY CASES WERE OUTLINED BUT NOT FULLY DETAILED.  As this is a book about someones career, the case details are not fully fleshed out.  If you are looking for a highly technical book on FBI case development, you won't find it here.  For this I was thankful, as I wanted to hear about her life and this book put it in this perspective, from her money problems (which we all have), to her relationship with her son, as well as her frustrations with her love life.<br />WELL BALANCED is how I would characterize this book.  It gives us just enough detail about her philosophy, her day-to-day life and the cases, so we know who Candice Delong is.  She doesn't embarass us with in depth details of her personal life to the point it is a tell all. One chapter discusses her moonlighting as a nurse and the relationship she develops with some of her patients.  She helps us all who can go out and spend money on a book, to put things in perspective.

Julia has avoided going home until now, running from her past and trying to create a life for herself independent of it.  However, after one failed marriage and an unconventional relationship resulting in this pregnancy, she felt it was time to confront her demons or her father as the case may be.<br />ABANDONED BY HER MOTHER AND PHYSICALLY ABUSED BY HER FATHER: Julia and her younger brother were abandoned by their mother when her mother left her unsatisfying and later abusive marriage to their father.  Julia's recollections of her mother are about the good times and she has built up considerable fantasies about why her mother left them.  She recognizes this, but mostly is troubled by the fact that her father beat her exclusive from her brother, later as she was growing up, and she never understood why.  Also her brother remained with their father after they grew up and even though he briefly attended college, returned to the family home and continued to remain living with their father.  She did not understand why he too did not choose to escape.<br />JULIA WANTS TO UNDERSTAND WHY: Julia has returned to understand the past.  This is not so easy as the past and present are not so easy to resolve to one another.  Julia's father is now a frail older man that is well respected in the community.  Only a few friends knew of the beatings Julia suffered at his hands.  He is now and has through their correspondence over the years, very considerate of her needs.  She feels this is all a sham and is determined to resolve her childhood traumas.<br />USULA HEGI, DOES A MASTERFUL JOB OF BRINGING THE CHARACTERS TO LIFE:  Ursula Hegi, does once again a masterful job of creating the musings of the main character's mind, weaving past present and other thoughts that crowd Julia's mind as she lives from day to day.

There is a whole life in all of these short stories.<br />POWER OF THE WRITER: These stories step you into lives either vastly different that your own, or incredibly familiar, and show how alike we really all are.  What these stories do show you, is how powerfully elegant Ursula Hegi is as a writer, to be able to do this.<br />EACH STORY IS CAPTIVATING IN ITS OWN WAY: Each of these stories could be a novel in its own right.  In fact that is the only complaint I have, is that I wanted more. It was evident each story was complete in its own right, but on the same token, you wanted to follow the writer's thoughts so you could see how things ended up.  Many stories were very introscpective, as much of Ms. Hegi's work is.  All related a feeling of belonging, betrayal, concern, happiness, etc.  These weren't so much spelled out, but you experienced them as you read the stories.<br />INTERESTING WAYS OF TELLING A STORY: I found several of the stories very compelling. One was by a person that was struggling with the wandering mind of a high fever.  Another was of a jilted bride that attended stranger's wedding in her wedding finery, to insure their good fortune.  In both of these stories, initially you don't know what's going on.  The fog of the central character is over your eyes as well.

The book is aptly named.  Floating in my Mother's palm is a girl's (Hanna) recollection of different bits and pieces of her life before her other-than-conventional mother (Jutta) died in a small town (Burgdorf) in post WWII Germany.  Through out the stories, Hanna recollects, you can see the guiding post of her mother at each important point.<br />FLOATING.. IS THE FIRST OF TWO BOOKS, BUT IS SET LATER IN TIME. The second book is Stones from the River, which chronicles the life of Trudi Montag; a young dwarf woman that is one of the key characters in young Hanna's life.  I would recommend reading &quot;Stones from the River&quot; prior to this book as it sets the stage for many of the characters in this book.  However, these are differently constructed books.  I found myself trying to link the facts (they were consistent) and found, I might be missing the point of the story.  It's not the details but the interweaving of events that fashion a life.  Stones from the River uses the details of a very different life to weave the story of Trudi Montag.  Floating uses broader strokes to paint Hanna's tale.<br />HANNA LIKE TRUDI, LEARNS FROM THE OUTSIDERS VIEWPOINT Hanna's unconventional mother Jutta is a painter and is close to her daughter in an different sense.  She passes on to her daughter her &quot;unclouded&quot; view of people and society and with this Hanna experiences many different sides of the small town she grows up in.  Trudi Montag, the town grape vine, also adds to this unique view as she is only too happy to provide Hanna with the knowledge of the town's darker side.<br />A short book in comparison with Stones from the River, but one very complete in its own sense.	2001-06-19

She's right.  I found myself while reading the book dutifully from beginning to end, often going back and rereading sections.<br />THE AUTHOR REVEALS HER INSECURITIES AND THEY ALL SEEM SO FAMILIAR.  However, what got me, was that the author was not a young woman.  She is in her late 50s, early 60s.  So much for outgrowing them.  Well, I had hoped.  She examined these insecurities and failings in a sense from a view, I had not expected; as if they were assets.  Now that's a thought. She had difficulty accepting this notion at first and the book subtly pushes this to the forefront again and again.  Fascinating.<br />THE AUTHOR'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HER ADULT SON IS MARKED WITH MIS-COMMUNICATIONS THAT DOMINATED THEIR PREVIOUS INTERATIONS.  However, by turning off the critic to herself, she was more accepting and could &quot;hear&quot; others better.  This greatly helped her and her son communicate on a new level.  Any parent who has children making that change from child to adult could really use help here.  Any help.<br />THERE ARE PARTS OF THIS BOOK THAT MADE ME LAUGH OUT LOUD AND OTHERS THAT WERE POIGNANT. The author relates a story, where she hires a professional organizer and within moments of this woman starting to do her job, pays her to stop and leave.  The author realized that she did not want to have her organization methods changed, but wanted a different outcome using the same methods... Don't we all.  Change requires...Change.<br />THERE ARE SO MANY WONDERFUL POINTS MADE IN THIS BOOK, A REVIEW, SHY OF RECREATING THE BOOK, CAN'T DO THEM JUSTICE.  The best a reviewer can say is Read this book, read it slow and think about it.  It is very Zen Buddist in philosophy and gives great weight to the day to day things.  However, unlike &quot;Sweeping changes&quot; a book centered in Zen philosophy around house cleaning and maintenance, this book does not focus so much on day to day activities directly, but the philosophies of day to day relationships with people.  The word Synchronicity comes to mind here.<br />I PLAN TO RE-READ THE BOOK IN A MONTH OR SO.  Books like this change in time.  Next time I could write an entirely different review because different things will catch my eye.

The story chronicles her life by setting the stage before her birth to a mother with a light grip on reality.  It continues on through the aftermath of World War II in a small town in Germany.<br />TRUDI MONTAG WAS DIFFERENT IN A WAY THAT WAS VISIBLE TO OTHERS: This she reasoned was why; she was rejected early in life by her mother and why; her mother went crazy.  Though she finally realized she was not to blame for her mother's problems, she took many years to come to grips with the fact she could not change what she was and in fact being different had some advantages.  Trudi had an opening in everyone's life in the town of Burgdorf, in the sense than many considered themselves more fortunate than her.  For this reason, they often revealed more of themselves to her, to show that they were not so fortunate in the end.  Due to this, Trudi developed a stronger sense of who every one was in this small town and was an intricate part in the grapevine, dispensing her stories to gain as much information as she delivered..<br />THE GROWTH OF THE NAZI PARTY IN GERMANY WAS NOT WELCOME BY ALL, BUT TO OPPOSE IT, WAS TO BECOME A TARGET OF IT.  This story through Trudi and the town of Burgdorf, lets the reader see, how Germany with the leadership of Hitler was duped into embracing a philosophy, that not only energized the nation, but enslaved it.  People in the town like Trudi who were different were more immune to the process than those who were mainstream and wanted to stay that way.  This book does a wonderful job of making the reader understand how such a horrible philosophy could be so embraced.<br />URSULA HEGI'S ATTENTION TO DETAIL BRINGS THE CHARACTERS IN TRUDI'S WORLD TO LIFE.  While reading the story of the day-to-day details of Trudi's life, from her thoughts, to the actions of the townspeople, you begin to see the undercurrents of the town in her eyes.  From the not so pious \\"fat priest\\", to her friend Eva with the birthmark and the unknown benefactor all the characters come alive and you see through Trudi's eyes the potential of their future lives.<br />This is an artfully crafted story, done as a prequel to the book she previous wrote: \\"Floating in my mother's palm\\", where her story of Burgdorf is continued on in one of the characters born toward the end of Stones from the River.

This book includes 83 floral, geometric, bird, butterfly, fish, Art Nouveau and Victorian style patterns that have been specially designed to highlight the faceted and shaped glass pieces that appear within them.  The patterns appear in square, rectangular, circular, octagonal and free-form shapes and can be used for lightcatchers, door and window panels, box tops and glass projects.  Bevels and jewels are no more difficult to incorporate into a pattern than regular stained glass sections.&quot;<br />Later in this same section they go on further about the contents of the book.<br />  &quot;The illustrations on pages 4-7 show the true size (and in some cases two views) of all the bevels and jewels that appear within the patterns on pages 8-64.  The patterns, however, appear within the book at half their actual size and will need to be xeroxed at a 200% enlargement in order for the bevels and jewels to fit.  The measurements that are printed next to each pattern give the dimensions to which it will be enlarged when doubled in size.&quot;<br />My impressions of the book, as I just received it are positive. There are some pretty nice designs inside from the tradition looking door insert types to some pretty intricate bird, fish and flower designs. None except for the cover are shown as a picture, all are sketches and drawings. Inside both covers are drawings with suggested colors of 11 of the designs within, but the rest only have the patterns in black and white.  All patterns have other patterns on the back side.<br />Some details are:<br />8 butterfly designs (some with flowers)<br />3 birds<br />3 fish<br />7 flowers (distinctly flowers and not stylized geometric renditions)<br />The bulk of the book, is stylized flower or geometric designs. Really neat looking ones.  This is not surprising as the bevels and jewels are limited to specific geometric shapes.<br />All in all a decent book.not stylized geometric renditions)<br />The bulk of the book, is stylized flower or geometric designs.

US	50791141	R3T3J1W3JSFRGX	0151002592	283575221	The Iron Bridge	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Fascinating read	Wow, this book drove home the idea of everyone's place in history.  Maggie Foster a young woman from the not so distant future is chosen by her fellow Ecosophians, because of her sympathetic abilities to go back in time to change history. The Ecosophians have determined that a single bridge an Iron Bridge's success propelled man into the industrial age, and caused the economic and social disasters that befell their world.<br />Maggie was transported into the world of 1773, with nothing but her wits, with the task to change the building of this bridge, so that the future would be altered.  Along the way the reader is transported to that time, of ironmakers and Quakers.  You are given glimpses into the poverty and the manipulations of politics that shaped that time.  If you think about it, continue to shape our time.  You also get a sense of what shapes each character and why they do what they do.You get into the skin not only of Maggie Foster, but of that of Abraham Darby III and John Wilkinson.  You are shocked by the character of all.<br />Getting into the character's skin brings you into the sense of how you would fit into the that time, the practices, the home life.  You really begin to understand how different some things were then.  Ironically, you can also see how similar some were, when it comes to family relationships and the manipulations that go into building the bridge.<br />The entire book is a surprise, there are some elements, I was unprepared for of a sexual nature, but provide an interesting counterpoint given the sensabilities of the day.  The more violent acts would have been accepted in that day and age because of the genders involved,and the ones based in affection would have been reason for an uproar also because of the genders involved.  The counterpoint of these two, was not lost on me. All in all, this is the first science fiction book I have read, that was truly set in the past.<br />I'm sure our salvation as a species is not in our technology, but what we do with it in good conscience.  This book drives this idea home.<br />Great job!echnology, but what we do with it in good conscience.  This book drives this idea home.<br />Great job!	2001-03-28

Many users wound up frustrated trying to create the intricate glass pieces featured in this book.  A grinder is a must.<br />However, on that note, I am in the process of making a lamp from this book and I am a rank beginner.  There are absolutely beautiful designs in here.  So much for listening to good advice.<br />For the beginner, without another reference, this book will not be enough.  There is very sparse instructions obviously assuming a non-beginner level.  You get only the patterns (full size).  This is great, as you don't have to mess with enlarging.  The designs are well centered, so easy to copy and have nothing on the back.<br />Another thing to note, is that the designs don't specify how many sides the shade will have so there is no finished dimensions or hardware notation.  This is really up to you.<br />With all those negative notes, I can't stress enough how interesting some of these patterns are.  Besides Irises, Rose and Gardenias, there are many geometric designs as well as bird designs in this book.  If you have the skill go for it.	2001-03-13
US	50791141	R3HY5RBFD4NZT0	0921520123	29137055	3: Elegant Lamps	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Beautiful lamps,  I wish I could make them all	The book is a collection of 22 lamps.<br />For each there is a full size lamp pattern and a single page of information pertinent to that lamp, such as: # of pieces, sides, height, bottom diameter, top diameter and base height(for the end table type lampshades).  Also the colors are noted as well as the type of glass used.  In the cover and the back of the book, you have color pictures of all of the lampshades in the book.  These are not just renderings but actual pictures, so are very helpful.<br />At the beginning of the book are hints on how to make lamp shades in general, which is pretty standard, and helpful, if you have no other source of information.<br />Almost all of these lamps have a bevel or multiple bevel glass pieces being used.  This is what makes some of them, look so interesting.  You don't have to use these but many of them make the lamp they are set in.<br />Of the 22 lamps included , there are:<br />9 hanging lampshades (15-21&quot; bottom diameters)<br />9 lampshades that are for typical end tables (ranging from 16-20&quot; base heights)<br />4 shades for gooseneck desk lamps.<br />The most difficult part of this book is to choose which one to make and which ones not to make.  They are all beautifully done and the bevels gives you an opportunity to experiment with this type of glass if you haven't already.	2001-03-07

It is great.  It helps fill in the gaps and reminds me of what I forgot.<br />This book covers both copper foil and leading.  While I can't speak for the leading, it has excellent information on the copper foil method.  It's information on equipment is also up to date.  Though the cover is in color the rest of the book is in black and white.  This is probably why a book so jam packed with information, was so inexpensive.  I didn't find the black and while photos to be a negative at all.  There are pictures of everything and this is great.  So many books just give you patterns and words.<br />Its tips on glass cutting I found very useful, since you don't always run into everything in class.  It saved me some broken glass.  Its troubleshooting hints on soldering were handy as well.<br />Also there are some projects in the back.  I haven't made any but they have complete instructions (pictures too) and the patterns included.<br />The contents since ... does not provide it, is as follows:<br />1.

I found the chapters to be way too long.  I don't know why this matters, but it just struck me that way.  Maybe some ideas were &quot;over covered&quot;?  However, this book had it's own charm.<br />I did find her discussions of meals and food to be a bit too much at times.  I guess too many details that attempt to display her growing knowledge of the local cuisine, that are not useful facts to me as a reader.  Also the recipes are limited for use in the average suburban home here, as the ingredients are not that common.  However, this was true for Under the Tuscan sun as well.  It just did not seem to be emphasized as much.<br />Her momentary concentration on the &quot;Mafia&quot; in Italy, I was prepared for as I read previous reviews.  Her vehemence struck me as been one that one feels when they find a flaw in a cherished item.  Her illusions of Italy are ones of an idyllic place and the presence of the Mafia or anything that does not fit that, obviously struck a dissonant chord with her.  She may very well be relating the opinions and attitudes of the people around her and not just her own.  I find it hard to think that these opinions as a foreigner here were not influenced by the local people she deals with.  Some of the comments struck me as ones only a local could perceive.<br />What I did find a bit rude was her characterizations of some of her visitors.  I certainly hope this was shared with them prior to publication.  Like Ann Landers says you can't be taken advantage of if you don't allow yourself to be (or something like that).<br />If you are looking for more on Bramasole, this book may disappoint.  This book featured more of her trips beyond Cortona and even into Venice.  Some people may find her self-absorption a bit over done at times, as she relates bits of her childhood and life outside of Italy.  However, I found it interesting to see how the &quot;other half&quot; lives.  I liked her way of relating her current thoughts with past actions.  Like collections and family life.  It is nice to get into her head.  I think we all do that to some extent and when we get a glimpse of what another thinks, it shows first that we are not so weird after all, but just how different or similar another's experiences are.<br />I guess what makes these books special to me is her way of describing the day to day surroundings as an American would see them.  This I feel makes them real for me.  She is going in with American expectations and when these are different she relates this.  I then feel like I have been there right along with her.  I wonder how a local feels when they read some of this?<br />All in all, it was a decent follow on to Under the Tuscan sun.  Not as good, but close.  The couple of pictures on the dust cover and the diagrams inside helped flesh out the area she was referring to.  The engagement calendar, does an even better job at that.<br />I have bought the next book she does on her life in Italy (In Tuscany)and am about to start it.  I feel she has a lot to offer as a writer.  In Bella Tuscany, she experimented a bit more in her writing, with some successes and failures.  I hope to see how she reacted to Bella Tuscany's impact with &quot;In Tuscany&quot;.  Also I'm looking forward to the pictures included in &quot;In Tuscany&quot; to further flesh out this world.owever, I found it interesting to see how the &quot;other half&quot; lives.

I haven't done all of the assignments yet, but I intend to.<br />Ironically some of the examples and assignments she suggests, I have done in ignorance of this book and the results are just what she predicted, so I know it works.<br />What I particularly like is that this book is not a &quot;Rah, Rah&quot;, happy yuppie book, like some of the ones out there but a more thoughtful approach for a person to carve out the life they want.

We don't read pages, we scan them<br />  b. We don't make optimal choices, we satisfice<br />  c. We don't figure out, how things work, we muddle through<br />2. It doesn't matter how many times I click as long as each click is a mindless unambiguous choice<br />3. Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what's left.<br />The first 5 chapters clearly illustrate the three &quot;Krug's Laws of Usability&quot; listed above with lots of pictures and examples.  Well done.<br />His chapters on navigation and finding your way around are a cookbook on how to do it right.  He finishes the chapters with several examples, first asking the reader to look at the examples and then discusses how he feels it should be redone.  Excellent teaching tool.  Similarly, he broaches the topic of the Home page and how it should be structured and the various forces pulling in different directions.  The examples he gives at the end here too are a good teaching tool.<br />The remainder of the book discusses the design processes and the usability tests.  These are excellent chapters in the forces at work and it is evident, he has done this many times from the information he has gathered.<br />He provides specific suggestions for web usability testing for various stages of sites as well as for various problems.  This is wonderful guidance if you are new at this.  He also provides a guideline on scripting and report writing.  Nice job.<br />He winds up the book with recommended reading and also providing a website for readers of this book: [...]	2001-01-10

He finds himself like a snowball in an avalanche taken in by a series of events he does not fully understand.  The first half of this book describes how he and his wife(Gwen) deal with the situation.  It is entertaining and fast paced.  Their banter and their relationship is interesting to follow.<br />However, the book makes a major shift when the &quot;real&quot; plot behind this book kicks in.  The author becomes enamored with details.  These details are negotiable as well, what is fact one minute is fiction the next.  Too many characters are introduced and their inter-relationships are way too hard to follow.<br />This last half of the book, deals with getting the main character to join this group that got him in this mess to start with.  Until the last 10 pages, you do not think he is planning on participating and even then, you are not sure what has happened.  A spotty attempt at explaining previous events is done in less than two pages and even then, you have no idea what precipitated those events.  The ending is depressing.<br />One thing struck me and this is my own commentary from reading Heinlein as an adult versus  when I was a teen, is how sexually obsessed he seems to be.  Enough said, not a soap box.  As a teen, it did not stand out, as an adult it does.  Also, it was interesting to see with all the new age technology described here, ballistic tubes, time travel, etc., there is not one cell phone.	2001-01-08

I have used it as a manual for task analysis in bits and pieces.  Eventually, I will read it cover to cover, as it deserves this attention and I need the information.<br />I was recommended this book by a colleague and since recommended it at least a dozen times myself to fellow human factors engineers and software/system designers.  It had the answers to many of the practical questions I was asking and being asked.<br />This book gives practical advice on how to analyse a task based on the &quot;things that need to be done&quot; to the &quot;people that need to do them&quot;.  Based on the recommendations, these are not &quot;pie in the sky&quot; ideas but practical tips from the people that do this work day to day.<br />If you read through the table of contents that Amazon provides you will find most if not all of your questions on how to go about this type of work answered within the pages of this book.<br />Briefly the Chapters are broken up into main segments of this type of work:<br />1. Introducing User and Task Analysis for Interface Design<br />UNDERSTANDING THE CONTEXT OF USER AND TASK ANALYSIS<br />2. Thinking about Users<br />3. Thinking about Tasks<br />4.

In a way this prepares you for the message of the book.  It is the little things that form us as well.<br />Upon reading the first section of the first chapter, a mere page or two, I knew this book was going to be a treat.  It frames for you a single thought or consideration about the world around you.  This I found well worth using the rest of the day to ponder.<br />I deliberately then read only one section each day.  Sadly after 39 days of having this book as my daily companion, I have finished reading it.<br />It was shear joy, as this book illuminates your own life, your common everyday occurances and helps you see how each contributes to the whole.  I plan to read this over and over again.  This has given me an inside to Zen, that I would not have oridinarily had.  With the bibliography in the back of the book I'm encouraged to read more.<br />Also, as not to miss the point of the name &quot;Sweeping changes&quot; it gives a much more satisfying view on housework.  It brings it more into an overall perspective.  You are caring for the things that help support you.  It is a synergistic relationship.<br />Fantastic book	2000-12-06

It's colors are rich and the drawings are very expressive.  The meaning of the cards are well expressed in the pictures.<br />Truly one of a kind.  Most tarot decks have blaise borders and pale colors.  Not this one.  Each picture is artfully done.  On top of that the picture dominates the entire card, there is no border, so the card really stands out.<br />The only negative is the plain blue with white stars back.  With such a beautiful face the backing is somewhat of a dissappointment.	2000-12-02

It has been in my possession that long.  Once again today, it helped me drag up a mathematical fact I had long forgotten.<br />In 1976 I graduated from college with an associates degree in engineering.  I had high school algebra, geometry, trigonometry and calculus behind me.  Also with my two year degree, I had calculus, analytical geometry and differential equations as well. I needed a single reference that would cover everything.  Then I happened upon this book in a bookstore.  What a prize this was!<br />Since that time, I have completed both my B.S.M.E and a Masters in Mechanical Engineering and I have this dog eared book beside me at all time.  From looking up linear algebraic equations, differential calculus, vector analysis, complex variables, all the way to the formula for the eccentricity of an ellipse for my son this evening, this book has baled me out of referring to ten other books.  It is well worth the investment.<br />Ironically, years later when discussing a geometric equation with a co-worker he commented that he relied on a great reference he found in  book store many years earlier while attending college.  You got it, it was the same book.<br />What I can't speak to is the last two chapters that are new to this edition.  Mine only goes to Chapter 20.<br />What I also should note, as a Mechanical engineer using this, I found it incredibly useful.  I have no idea if a person that does not regularly use geometry, trigonometry, algebra, calculus, linear algebra,  etc., would get very much use from it or not.  For students in this field I found it to be very useful. Basically, read the table of contents Amazon provides and make your own judgement.	2000-11-28

His first &quot;Many Lives, Many Masters&quot; chronicals his discovery of the potential for regression therapy, to allow patients to explore past lives, not just earlier times in this life.<br />In Many Lives, Many Masters, he has one patient Catherine, that regression therapy aids with some of her psychological problems. This discovery challenges some of Dr. Weiss' previously held beliefs and leads him to using the technique further to test the validity of this apparent past life memory.  In Many Lives, Many masters this is done annecdotally and not very scientifically.  However, the story flows and glues you to the page.  He explores Catherine's lives as well as his own reactions to this information.<br />With Through Time into Healing, Dr. Weiss's light treatment of his new found cure gets even lighter.  The book tells of case after case (his and his colleagues) where patients have been healed using regression therapy.  The connection as to why they are healed is mere supposition.  Many facts are very light.  I would say this book has over 100 (if not more) cases being recounted.  The are categorizes by the type of healing needed.  This makes for tedious reading after the 25th believe me.<br />The table of Contents is below:<br />The beginning<br />Hypnosis and Regression<br />Through experience into Understanding<br />Healing the body by healing the mind<br />Healing Troubled Relationships<br />Healing the Inner Child and the Abused Child<br />Healing the need to Protect: Uncovering the sources of Obesity and Substance Abuse<br />Healing the Grieving<br />Opening the Mind to the Power of Mystical Experiences<br />Enriching your life<br />The Techniques of Regression<br />Finally in the last chapter he discussed the technique and provides the dialogue that you can record to put your self in a hypnotic trance and attempt to regress.  There are many caveats and suggestions why you may not succeed or find other than what you anticipated.  It is a start. I have not yet tried the regression technique yet, but I will.  If it works I will write another review.<br />I was very disappointed in this book, in the sense that as a trained therapist, he brought little science or technique to the various stories being told.  As Many Lives, Many Masters enthused me, this book disappointed me.  I expected more from a man trained in the field of psychiatry.  He many be a believer in past lives now, but he seems to have ditched his previous scientific leanings which would have offered so much more credence to this concept.ons why you may not succeed or find other than what you anticipated.

I'm only 1/3 of the way through that and have no comment yet.  However, this review is specifically for the engagement calendar.<br />This engagement calendar tempted me since reading Under the Tuscan sun and starting on Bella Tuscany.  I wanted to see some of the scenes in my head courtesy of Frances Mayes fleshed out. I was not dissappointed.<br />This engagement calendar (and I'm not someone who normally buys these) is wonderfully prepared.  From the choice of golden and ochre border to the golden suffused pictures inside.  It will be a pleasure to use through out the year.  It will not get discard at the end of the year either but stored safely with my copies of Under the Tuscan Sun, Bella Tuscany (partially read at this review) and In Tuscany (recently purchased).<br />Thank you Frances Mayes for painting this portrait of Italy from an American's eyes.	2000-11-27

It opens the door and shows the methodology that is used.  This is the kind of exposure all testing should be given, but is rarely offered because of the potential for criticism.  Unfortunately, sometimes with this type of testing, as happened here, you gain more questions than answers.  But very good questions!<br />One important thing the book brought home for me, was that a webpage is not a document.  Over and over again, the testing shows here that people do not use webpages like books or documentation.<br />Also an interesting thing that was brushed on was the separate uses of a webpage: Surfing versus information gathering.  These are definitely different tasks and it was particularly useful for this report to be published to provide the preliminary information for us to start with.  You really have to consider these as different applications, and test your site accordingly.  You also have to ask yourself which of the uses is more important to you, if a tradeoff needs to be made.<br />One concern I had with the testing was the task list.  In each site there was specific tasks the user was assigned to do.  If I were given these I would dive right into Cnet and Edmunds and stumble in all the rest.  Why, because they are interests of mine.  I have been to those sites and the information is familiar.  However, if I were given the Fidelity task set, not only the site but the task would be unfamiliar to me.  I wondered how much that played in the user's preference and usability of those sites.  That is a tough thing to balance for, but may be a real factor in a user's experience in a site. Future testing (if it was not here) should probably account for the user's experience in the subject field.  This I don't recall being directly addressed in the book.<br />This book was wonderfully written, very conversational in style and lots of graphics.  I learned a lot and will be reading more from these authors in the future.erfully written, very conversational in style and lots of graphics.

She dwelt not only on what she saw, but the significance of those events and views to her.  Especially poignant was her observations on her family home and neighborhood after she had dwelt for sometime in that of Vermeer household.<br />What was surprising was the significance and interpretations of some events based on 17th century thinking.<br />The story centers around the young woman; Griet who is portrayed as being the woman in Vermeer's famous painting; &quot;Girl with a Pearl earring&quot;.  This story shows her family background and the story behind why she has come to be a maid.  You see the story unfold as this Protestant girl ventures in to Papist corner to join her employer's household.  Her interactions with her Master, his wife and Mother as well as his children and other maid, come to show each's personality so clearly.<br />What is most hard to wrap your mind around is how few &quot;rights&quot; a poor person has compared to the wealthy in that day and age.  Griet's sense of position, though she was not subservient, was that blame traveled down the hill of status and had more to do with who you were than what you did.  Her perspective was not one of outrage as mine would be, but of acceptance and awareness of this disparity.  She often had to tread softly and react to events that she was to be blamed with, warily.  Innocence was not enough.<br />The story unfolds how she came to be in one of her Master's paintings and what is interesting is the reaction and concern for this by all the parties in the book.  You see the reaction in the 17th century of a woman displaying her hair, to the significance of earrings and facial expressions.  What was also interesting was her reaction and interest in Vermeer's paintings and the process of them.  I never realized any of this was part of the process.  I can only assume the writer did some research on how paintings were done in those times.<br />It makes for a facinating read.  It gives you an opportunity to step back in time.

With that said my review follows:<br />There are so many positives  in this book that I will list the negatives first, there are few and very  minor at that.<br />The cover has got to go.  It does not represent the depth  and wealth of the information inside.  To be honest, it looked so poorly  thought out and old, I felt the contents of the book must be too.  Thankfully, I dropped my bias and was very pleasantly surprized.<br />The  other negative may be my own personal preference, but I like the footnote  detail at the bottom of the page, so when I see it I don't have to scoot to  the end of the chapter to see what it is.  This is how good the book was, I  read all the footnotes and references too.<br />Marlana Coe has created a book  that I hope not only do Technical writers from all over read, but Human  Factors professionals too. As a fanatic-pursuer of documentation meeting  its goal to communicate, this book says it all.  The usability measurement  on documentation is whether or not it allows the author to communicate to  the reader and Marlana Coe shows you just how to do that.  In fact, she  shows you while doing that herself.<br />I bought this book because as a Human  Factors professional, I find we do not practice what we preach.  We review  a product and come up with wonderful ideas to make it better and then  proceed to hide that in a document that is not geared for the reader. Many  technical reports, even the ones that only have a small group of customers,  don't meet those customers needs.  There are no pictures, tables and  diagrams and worst of all no logical organization for the reader to create  a structure around the information.  The documents are geared for the  writer to regurgitate data, not for the reader to absorb it.  Granted this  is not all, but too much of a majority in a group of people that should  know better. Most human factors professional know, how to increase  usability of everyone else's product but their own: the technical report  they create on products they review.  This book bridges that gap, for HF  professionals especially.  Yes, I'm including myself in this category (I  did buy the book after all).<br />For all the rest of you, this gives you  reasons for all the practices that good technical writers should use. From  the amount of white space to use to the number of fonts and colors.  There  are also suggestions on organization and on construction of these  documents.  One section discussed content and the importance of context of  usage.  This is something, I never really thought of that much.

This Pilates book has the best  explanations and illustrations of all the ones out there. I know, I was in  the mall and I checked them out.<br />I bought this book over 6 months ago, as  I felt I needed more than just a regular workout on an elliptical machine.  I wrote a review on it shortly after I started and I wanted to update that  as a number of people have emailed me for more information.<br />Some  background.  I'm 43, female and 25% overweight, not exactly your svelte  exerciser, so I knew I needed a routine that wouldn't hurt but would would  get results.  I work in an office and nothing is worse than sitting at your  desk all day aching from the previous day's exercises.<br />I started as  recommended with Modified beginner exercises, the seven basic exercises and  did this for about 3 weeks.  No pain but some tightness I could feel in my  abdomen.  As I became confident, I moved onto the regular beginner  exercises.  Basically, I used my ability to do the &quot;hundred&quot; as a  measure of  when I was able to move on. I could see my progress from day to  day.  It was really neat.  I did the exercises at least 5 days/week.<br />As  time went on I added more exercises from the full program. One or two each  week depending on if they were similar or really hard to do.  Some were,  some weren't.  Still no pain.  I am now doing almost all (over 95%) of  all, but the advanced exercises at least 5 days/week along with my  elliptical machine routine and some weight lifting for my arms.  I don't  have time, I make time. In my opinion, this is as important as paying my  bills.  In someways, this is just what I'm doing.<br />One question, I have  been asked is am I seeing muscle definition. The answer is definitely yes.  I am still overweight.  I'm working on that too (I've lost 25 pounds  through just exercising), so I'm not seeing a washboard stomach, as the fat  above the muscles are still obscuring them, but I can see definition of my  ribs and hips, along with distinct muscles in between.  This is nothing  I've ever seen before, even in my skinny high school days.<br />One  interesting measure of how far I've gone is watching my teenage children  trying to mock me doing the exercises.  Both are slim and in good shape,  but neither can dive in and do the intermediate exercises that I'm doing  with the same ease I am.  In fact they are shocked they can't do more than  a couple repetitions.  Not because it hurts so much, but because they have  not build up the strength.<br />That is another thing that I mentioned in my  previous review, these exercises provide the feedback you need to continue  on.  You see it in each day in each exercise as they become easier.  Also  you see it in your day to day tasks.<br />For me, it was an excellent  investment.inition of my  ribs and hips, along with distinct muscles in between.

It is rich in  detail and commentary.  What makes it especially interesting is that as a  &quot;typical&quot; though well-traveled and educated American, she brings  a perspective that only a foreigner with no roots in a country can bring.  She sees the locals customs as new and not entirely understood.  Probably  the way most of us would see them.<br />I especially enjoyed it as I'm not  widely traveled.  I loved reading the characterizations of the locals.  It  is funny to realize that we all think somewhat alike when we take to  watching people.  We try to put a story to their lives from what we  see.<br />Her recipes are created to make use of local produce and very Tuscan  in character.  Most did not appeal to me as they seemed fairly involved.  However, they as well as the book were interesting to read.<br />It is  interesting too to see the other side of a professor's life.  Too often  those of us who have attended college or for that matter high school  imagine our professors as substantially different from ourself.  I wonder  what her students thought.<br />As a person who has various homes and has gone  through the remodeling game through both my efforts and that of hired help,  I recognized that leap of faith when you have to choose a contractor.  To  do that in a foreign country in a second language for that level of work  makes it even more terrifying.  At any moment I'm sure she felt the walls  would come tumbling down.  On top of that when your home is not in order,  neither are you.  It was nice to read about other people experiencing that  same terror and trials.

The art work is riveting.  Malcolm  Goodwin's illustrations have such motion in them they are a joy to look at.  The color and illustrations as well as the quality of this publication is  top-notch.  This was obvious by just paging through it the first time.  I've nearly dog-eared the pages by now.<br />As a person who has dabbled with  astrology, numerology, palm reading, personality types, etc. this books  puts them all in one place and simply.  It is like all my mini-vices in one  neat package.<br />There are four sections of evaluations: Body, Feeling,  Thinking and Spiritual. In each of these you can evaluate where you fit and  what characteristics each type is endowed with.<br />The introduction at the  beginning of the book puts it all into perspective.  You get out of this  book what you put into it. The author indicates there are four ways you can  approach the book.<br />1. As entertainment.<br />2. As a map of the types of  people out there, some we are kin to.<br />3. A means of understanding your  own behavior.<br />4. A means of realizing who you are, versus who you think  you are or want to be.<br />Rarely does a book truly respond to all these  needs. If you want a lightly entertaining book and you dive in with that  attitude, you'll get that.  If you want a sense of direction of where you  are to where you want to be.  This may help you get there.  If you want a  sense of who you are, this can help.<br />I don't know if people serious in  any of these subjects would find this book accurate or even correct.  I  really don't know enough to check this.  And if I did, what would be the  point?<br />This book is about self discovery. To be honest, I doubt someone  really serious in any of these would buy this book unless to look at the  areas they are not that experienced in.  Each topic of self discovery, all  101 of them take up only (2) 8-1/2&quot; X 8-1/2&quot; pages.  Just enough  to introduce the topic, give you the scale to work with and it's  characteristics.  If you want to go further on the topic, you have enough  background information to start digging in.<br />I have spent many an  entertained hour just going back and forth from one topic to another.  What  is really neat is when a bunch of people look at it all at once too.  The  discussions can get pretty interesting.  It is a discovery in itself when  you see what ratings others give you.  Teenagers have a ball with  this.<br />This book is perfect for the young person who is trying to realize  who they are and who they want to be.  For the middle ager like myself and  the elderly, it is interesting to note where I've been as well as where I'm  going.  You can also look at your children's types as well.<br />All and all,  this book is a good investment.<br />This is a book that can be fun,  introspective and enlightening.) 8-1/2&quot; X 8-1/2&quot; pages.

Unfortunately, it gives us  little more than dated information with a bit of new stuff tacked  on.<br />What really dissappointed me was that the anthropometric data that is  provided here, dates back to that of the original's 1960's data.  What is  the point of a new edition?  The census data stated here is so dated it is  ridiculous, both in composition as well as age.  I wish I had known that  this data was not updated prior to my investing in the new edition. I would  not have purchased it.<br />I question the usefulness of data published in so  recent a book based primarily on Air force personnel of the 60s.  That type  of data had it's day &amp; was appropriate at it's original publishing.  Today's Human Factors professional needs more diversified data that is more  international in it's scope.  For that matter, I'm certain 1960s air force  personnel (who are screened for height and weight) hardly represent the  year 2000 demographics of the United States much better.<br />I found it  interesting that the same graphics that may have been the best you could do  in the original were repeated in this new document. Couldn't they refresh  some of the look, clean up some of the old graphs.  As the original was,  this document is a mix of font styles, graphics and inconsistent data  presentation.  Does this truly represent the user of the document well? I  recognize presentation is not &quot;everything&quot; but on a second pass  of the same information you could dress it a bit better at least.<br />The  major addition predictably is the data surrounding workstations and  computer usage, however, I'm questioning it's usefulness relative to the  anthropometric data also here.  Is this new data based on aged human  measurement data too?  Will it only fit the 1960 US air force man and  woman?<br />I think this book would have been better printed as an addendum to  the original version costing about $25.  This way the workstation data  could be added plus any items that are new.ta based on aged human  measurement data too?

This was my mistake, it does  not advertise itself for this but was recommended to me for this purpose by  another individual.  It does have some of this, but inconsistantly.  As I  am interested in color both jobwise and for decorating, I read it  regardless.<br />COLORS WERE OFF IN CHIPS FOR PREFERENCE CHECK: The major  thing I find fault with, was the color chips it uses in its test for  personal preference, were poor representatives of the colors it was meant  to represent.  Ironically, there is a disclaimer on the  book that this may  not be a true representation, but I would think a book about color  preferences should go out of its way to be sure this is done well.  All the  color chips appeared to be washed out.  As I do not like pastels, I feel  this &quot;colored&quot; my impressions significantly.  Also I feel some  were quite a bit off either too much yellow or green etc.<br />INDIVIDUAL  COLOR SUBTOPICS INCONSISTENT: The other major complaint I has was that  under the specific color topics (there were 11), the subtopics were  inconsistent.  If I wanted to compare the physiological responses of Red to  that of Brown for instance, I would be out of luck as the subtopics from  one color to another were not consistent.  Some had one type of  information and another had others.  I also found the information provided  on each color to be more of just a memory dump of information on each color  and not necessarily entirely pertinent or stuff I would really want to  know.<br />COLOR COMBINATION EXAMPLES NOT NEAR DISCUSSIONS: Another thing I  found particularly frustrating is that examples of color combinations  showing various moods were interspersed in the book, and not near the  discussion.  It made is hard to compare and you were always turning  pages.<br />COLOR MOOD DISCUSSIONS SHOWED NAMES INSTEAD OF COLORS: Besides  having the examples not near the color mood discussions, there were names  of colors used, that weren't even repeated in the examples or elsewhere in  the book.  I did not check all, but the several I did check this was the  case. If nothing else even the RGB equivalents would have helped.  Maybe  these were Pantone names (it didn't indicate this), but unless you have a  chart this would not help.<br />PUTTING THE  COLOR MOOD EXAMPLES INTERSPERSED  IN THE BOOK WAS CONFUSING TO THE AREA IT WAS PLOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF: Even  when reading, since you would read the first part on color moods before  that of the individual colors, it was confusing when you ran into the color  mood discussions while reading about a specific color that it was not  pertinent to.  On top of that in order to refer back to the color mood  examples, you had to find their discussion area to find their page numbers  instead of being able to refer just to a specific area to go back to.  I  used post it note tabs to keep track, but I shouldn't have to.<br />This book  could've been so much more.

This romance novel explored the life of its central character \\"Danina\\"  through the eyes of her granddaughter at the introduction.  Rather than  being romantic and mysterious, I felt in many ways this was tragic and all  too common an occurrence. A young woman supposedly close to her grandmother  while she was a child and a young adult, inherits through her grandmother's  death, a package that contains toe shoes and love letters.  This young  woman through translation of these letters discovers how little she truly  knew about her grandmother.  Amazing.  I see this happen every day, with  children that have parents and grandparents from a foreign country or just  a distant past.  The children are bored or embarrassed about their  \\"different\\" relatives and miss the richness of their own past. What is  defined as a close relationship here, in many cultures would pass as a mere  acquaintance.  The author was wise to point out the opportunities  missed.<br />The story goes on the about the grandmother's past life.  This  as most romance novels do, go on about a very attractive petite incredibly  graceful child with a widower father and four sons placing his only  daughter in a ballet boarding school.  She of course flourishes and is the  favorite of the head mistress.  I'm being particularly heavy on the  adjectives here because I believe the author outdid herself in this  regard.<br />Danina (the grandmother) the young adult at the peak of her  popularity becomes acquainted with the Czar's family and enchants them all.  Unfortunately, at some point in time she catches the flu and becomes  gravely ill and is taken under the wing of the Czar's family.  There she  is nursed to recovery.  She becomes involved with a member of the Czar's  staff and her head mistress is understandable shaken about her commitment  to ballet.  Unfortunately, this is no simple relationship, this man is  married and would lose his position and she her position as a prima  ballerina with the scandal.<br />The story goes on about this struggle and  some of the upheavals in Russia at that time as well as Danina and her  lover's involvement.  Without giving the rest of the story away, the book  goes on to unfold how she ends up in Vermont and her life there.<br />As far  as romance novels go, this was typical with the obsession on how unusually  attractive, graceful and every over the top gushing adjective there could  be to describe the central character.  This girl was ultra devoted, right  as rain and always trying to do the right thing.  The lover was dashing  powerful and true. The story was interesting in the setting, ballet,  pre-revolution Russia and the situation that unfolded.<br />However, just for  once, I would like a romance novel, to have an average looking central  character, maybe a little pudgy, with bad skin and with the usual questions  about what the right thing to do is, versus just knowing it.  I would like  the love interest to be not quite so perfect, maybe skinny with a big nose  and less than perfect employment history.  It would be nice if they would  find each other and work through day to day struggles to pay the bills and  define their relationship.  You know the important stuff, like who does the  dishes and who cooks.  You would see them, dealing with corporate America,  or maybe Central South America or today's Korea, with all the issues that  play in a normal relationship: Money, Sex, Commitment, Long term planning  and Communication.

You hear the thoughts in her head and are amazed they are not dissimilar to your own. She has moments that freeze in time, where she recalls past events, suddenly and very  vividly.  Events that though are not forgotten, but have gotten rusty due  to lack of use.<br />With this reminiscing she recalls her former self and  tries to understand the people and events in her past.  Some were very  disturbing.  Most are guilded with the innocence of youth.<br />The author  sets the stage with the main character Jo, having an &quot;epiphany&quot;  of sorts, a freeze frame that another turning point in her life is being  reached.  She builds for the reader the story of Jo's life with the day to  day details.  When you are reading this book, you are Jo, if only for a  moment.<br />In this contented recently empty nest life, Jo and her husband a  minister she does not share a faith with, go about their normal lives with  no sense of &quot;what's next&quot;.  Only recently has the last of their 3  daughters moved out and they are reinventing their schedule and getting to  know one another as a couple again.<br />Due to a connection provided by her  daughter Sadie,  Jo runs into a former friend of her counter-culture life  in her early 20s.  Back when they shared a communal house one of their  housemates was murdered.  The author builds through Jo's recollecting how  she remembers that life and it's initial innocence.  It also shows Jo's  confused sense of self at that time.<br />Jo's relationship to her past is  soon caught up in her association with this man.  This sets up events that  nearly destroy her marriage.  This relationship provides her an  opportunity to explore and revisit the person she once was. She examines  her motivation and questions it as well.  It is a very good portrait of  some of the questions one asks oneselves when faced with hard issues.  Most  of us would like to think we know the answers.  Most of us find out, we  have no clue.<br />Without giving away the twist of the story, I have to say,  the author had my heart pounding when I realized what a dialogue was  unfolding into.  It was masterfully handled and ironically later on was  paralleled with one conversation Jo had with her mother.<br />This book gets  into your head and you understand many of Jo's feelings observations and  day to day life.  You get to understand how she thinks.  She is a closed  person and you see this in her thoughts, which are rarely revealed to the  characters around her.  Her relationship to her coworkers, husband and  daughters are well defined.  As a mother you can see the dynamic that  unfolds, when there is family competition between childen.  The author  handles this well.<br />I found this book facinating and highly recommend  it.<br />The only critique I would make is to the author.  While Jo and her  husband are highly educated people, I'm not sure some of the  &quot;vocabulary&quot; is realistic for the characters.  I felt sometimes  the author dipped into her own background with linguistics versus the  characters. This happened only a few times, but it seemed out of character  at the time.ind out, we  have no clue.<br />Without giving away the twist of the story, I have to say,  the author had my heart pounding when I realized what a dialogue was  unfolding into.

It is a thin veiling of Sylvia Plath's own history.  Sadly later on she succeeded.<br />With this in mind  from the first chapter it is easy to see that the author felt separate from  her \\"healthy\\" counterparts.  I think most of us feel that at some time,  however her disassociation became more complete.  I was wishing, I had had  a sense of what she was like before this began.  Was this an extreme  change or did she often feel set apart, when she was technically  healthy.<br />What is frightening about this book is that while you are in her  head with the writing, none of her thoughts or feelings seem so outrageous.  In the afterward it indicated she pondered rewriting the whole story from  the outside perspective, from her mother and associate's point of view.  There were some references that were startling, as the not changing clothes  and bathing that were not apparent to the reader that she adds in  occasionally.  This gives you a sense of a disconnect between the inside  and the outside that she was feeling.  This outside perspective would have  added much to understanding the why for her mother's first suggestion to  seeing a doctor, as from \\"Esther's\\" view this seemed unnecessary.  Ironically, the character never really questioned the need for either the  doctor's visit or the electroshock therapy.  This shows the character's  ability to comply, regardless of how she felt.  Authority and other's  measurements of her, as most good student's played a very strong part in  her personality.<br />Later on, when she is recovering in the asylum, her  relations with other people improve, however, she does not appear to the  reader to be so different in thought.  It appears that the measurement of  success is entirely based on the patient's relation to the outside world.  As there were no more references to poor hygiene or suicidal thought, this  apparently was the mark of wellness.  From the reader's perspective this  does not necessarily make the transition from a lack of mental health to  one that is acceptable, so obvious.  It also apparently does not give the  patient a framework to work with.  This is evident by the fact that she  did go on to successfully commit suicide years later.<br />This is a coming  of age story that many people have faced in one sense, though not to that  extreme, when they get to an age of moving from the teenage world to that  of an adult.  Often this is triggered by moving from the academic setting  to that of the working world.  There a disconnect that happens there.  The  high achieving student that Sylvia Plath was, was apparently unprepared for  the shift in priorities that happens during this shift.  She lost her  footing and until her behavior became extreme, no one noticed..<br />As this  is the second time I read this book, it is evident, I hold it in high  regard.  It is easy to empathize with the character of Esther and her  dilemma's.  In some ways too easy.  I think most of us when we are  troubled disassociate ourselves with the world around us and become very  egocentric.  This book may serve as blue print for testing yourself to see  how well you are doing.  I also think this is a good book for young  people at this stage to read.  It will give them some sense that someone  has been there and done that and maybe it can get them to ask for help  before they get to the point she did.his  apparently was the mark of wellness.

US	50791141	R1QFQOB28AFRY0	0451191153	594264062	The Fountainhead	Books	5	4	9	N	N	Fantastic book	I had a hard time putting this book down.  Considering the length of it, this shows how interesting it was.<br />There were 5 main characters, Howard Roark, Dominique Francon, Peter Keating, Gail Wynand and Ellsworth  Toohey.  Each character was well developed in a sense that once you were  in their head you knew what they were going to do next, with one exception.  I felt Dominique Francon's character was frequently inconsistent and her  motivations at times pretty muddy.<br />The book takes you from before Howard  and Peter finish college until about 20 years later.  The story parallels  these two men's careers as architects.  They covered the architecture  aspect just enough so you could see where the argument was but, not to the  point where it would lose the readers.  In this aspect, you are under no  doubt that Howard is passionate about his craft and Peter is merely giving  it lip service.  Peter is into architecture as an end to a means.  It has  the pontential of making him popular.  Most of the disputes in architecture  center around the traditional versus modernistic view point.  Traditional  meaning keeping to the Greek Porticos and decorative features of the past  versus a style more centered on function.  Howard is dedicated to the fact  that form should fit function.<br />Mostly this book centers on the inner  lives of the characters and the forces that affect their personal  decisions.<br />Howard is an end to himself, where Peter does not exist  unless someone else is in the room.  These two characters choices are  about as opposite as can be found.<br />Ellsworth Toohey, whom is  mentioned in passing early on, gets further developed later in the book and  provides a manipulating force in Peter's life &amp; that of many others.  This character early in his life discovered the two extremes of  personalities as Howard and Peter and has discovered the secret of using  the &quot;Peter Keatings&quot; of the world.<br />Gail Wynand is an even  more complex character than Ellsworth in the sense that he at one point in  time stood alone, but at some point due to some various situations in his  youth, became power hungry and decided on a similar path as Ellsworth  Toohey.  However, he never quite consciously made this choice and really  was almost unaware of the path he chose &amp; his dependency on the people  he controlled.<br />Dominique Francon, never really gets developed to the same  point as the male characters.  Early on as a co-worker to Ellsworth Toohey  and the daughter of Peter's employer, she is shiftless and comes across as  just spiteful.  You are not sure if she is a Toohey disciple or worse.  Later on in her dealing with Howard, Peter and Gail, her motives and logic  are still a bit ill defined.  I think Ayn Rand was negligent in giving her  female character's the necessary development in the book for her to be  understood.  Considering that she wrote this in the 1930s and 40s and the  fact that the character had 3 husbands, this may have been the furthest she  dared to go, lest the reading audience would unnecessarily focus on  that.<br />Much of this book is dialogue between the characters, you have to  follow it closely.  Some of Ellsworth Toohey's one on ones with the various  characters make you think of the many political speeches we hear every day.  Then, when you consider the black heart of the character, it is  frightening.<br />I think a person in their teens and 20s would walk away from  this book with a different take than one in their 40s, as I am.  An  idealistic 20 year old still believes there are these singular characters  out there like Howard and Peter, etc.  They would get quickly discouraged  with others and themselves, when they walked away from this book.  An older  person would recognize that most people have of blend of characters and  these change with time.  Then, one can only hope that we have more Howard  than Peter &amp; hope we are not deluding ourselves like Gail Wynand.<br />An  excellent book, I am under no doubt why it is a classic.ourselves like Gail Wynand.<br />An  excellent book, I am under no doubt why it is a classic.	2000-07-22

Well, I shouldn't have.  It set my expectations too high.  When I finished the  Elusive Flame, I felt it was aptly named, something was missing, a style, a  feeling in the writing. The timing, wording and depth of the Flame and the  Flower were entrancing.  Without getting into specifics, I felt the  Elusive Flame followed the same &quot;formula&quot; as the Flame and the  Flower, but the rest just wasn't there.  In fact I thought a ghost writer  might have just followed out a blue print. Mind you, I gave it a 3 because  even though it was not the quality I expect from Kathleen Woodwiss, it was  still exceptionally better than much of the competition.	2000-06-27
US	50791141	R1IHXA0VE8AQTW	0679781587	823326041	Memoirs of a Geisha: A Novel	Books	5	2	2	N	N	I'm not a Japanese culture buff, but this was a great book.	After reading newspaper reviews on this book all giving it high praise, I decided to give it a shot.<br />I had a hard time putting it down, it was enthralling.<br />It has been awhile since I read a book that has so taken me  out of my day to day life, and to one so much different.  It was so well  developed and described I could see what Japan and it's people looked like  as the character lived it. This book excels in details from the application  of the Geisha's makeup, the wrapping of the obi, to the involved hierarchy  of the Japanese culture at that time.  These are not senseless details but  brought out in a way that one things about things that catch your eye.  It  was so subtly done it was like you were in the character's mind, while they  were thinking. I found the relationships between the characters well  developed.  They grew with each subsequent line as well. When I finished  the book I was a bit lost, as it had so captured my imagination.<br />It  has opened my mind up to a small portion of Japanese culture that I had no  ideas about.<br />Besides just being a story about a specific type of person  (a Geisha) this is a very involved story about how she became a Geisha, the  people she knew and the formative points in her life.  On just this alone  the book would be captivating.  Adding in the fact that so few Westerners  have any idea what the Geisha culture was at that time, was a major  plus.<br />I really enjoyed the book and recommend it highly.	2000-06-19
US	50791141	R2F8RQMEQNURBH	0385267746	323452923	The Design of Everyday Things	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Great book even if you are not in Human Factors engineering	I had to read this book for a course.  However once I started it, I wanted to read it. All those oddball things like pushing the wrong side of doors, not knowing whether to push or pull, that we all do and blame ourselves,  are not our fault.  Something in the design led to our incorrect behavior.  This is a fundamental concept of Human Factors and Don Norman captured it  perfectly. A must read for Human Factors engineers and an interesting read  for the rest of the world.  I'm buying more of his books.	2000-06-16

Having seen some minor ruins myself in Mexico, the author reanimated my memories of those.  I also found the action scenes to be easy to follow.  This can be difficult when describing locations of characters in an action  scene. Excellent book with quite a twist in the plot in true X files  fashion.	2000-06-15

Of course they don't have the actors quirky delivery but they are the next best thing.  This book did a great job of  describing the details so you could easy follow what was going on.  Let's  face it X-files has some pretty interesting situations, so the author here  had to do a more than adequate job of getting their point across.	2000-06-15
US	50791141	R3AA21LPENA09O	0312204035	237673404	The Doctor Stories	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Interesting book, but not all &quot;doctor&quot; stories	When I bought this book I was expecting stories of a primarily doctor's point of view. Though all of the stories, detail various medical conditions, they are not always from the perspective of the doctor. This is also a mostly fictional work. (I'm sure if I read the back cover I would have found that out). However, it is not dissappointing. It is interesting how the author has woven a story very detatched from a medical format around a specific condition in each case. I found it very interesting and plan to buy more of this author's books. Some of the stories have a melancholy side that I'm sure effects the medical community as a whole in hopeless cases or ones where the patient does not seek care beyond diagnosis. It was a good read none the less.	2000-06-15
US	50791141	RB4V0KZM7U9GI	0312243022	785940945	The Hours: A Novel	Books	3	10	17	N	N	Not that impressive	I read this book because it said it was a Pulitzer prize winner, so I went in with high expectations.  There is much comparison to Virginia Woolf's work, which I have read none of. However, I found this book within a book  and overlapping characters nothing special.  It's been done.  The over  analysis of the dissassociation of the characters to their world was  interesting, however, also not especially brilliant.  I expected more.  It  was mildly entertaining at best.	2000-06-14

I thought the science was well done and not too technical and I could  easily imagine this as if it were on TV.  I have see all but 6 of the X  files programs and though, I am an engineer, not a scientist, I found the  technical aspects of the book to be reasonable.  Maybe the detractors have  their imagination to fault more.	2000-05-23

This book is a step by step plan to walk you through a course with an intructor.  The author also intersperses comments of other &quot;classmates&quot; throughout the book so you have in a sense some of your questions answered in a bit more detail than if you were reading a purely technical book.  This book is pretty basic, so some of the questions are.<br />LIMITED TOPICS BUT HAS YOU DOING THE WORK TOO:  It covers a limited amount of topics, but gives you a comfortable feeling of how to start to program.  To ge the best use out of the book you should do the exercises as they are assigned.  You will definitely get your moneys worth.<br />NOT GOOD AS A REFERENCE BOOK:  I would not recommend it as a reference book, but as one worth going through cover to cover. I did and have now many programs under my belt. Going back to this book with a question not pertaining to the lessons will not be useful, unless it is identical in format.<br />MORE BOOKS LIKE THIS AT A HIGHER LEVEL:  I have bought two more of his books because of this one on more complex topics.  I haven't gone through them in detail yet, but I plan to.  He has a nice style and you can backtrack easily and not lose too much ground if you have set the book aside for awhile.<br />A comfortable learning experience	2000-05-23
