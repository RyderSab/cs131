All the avid fans of Cornwell's wait a year in-between books because of the wonderful story lines, great detail, and spine tingling thrills.  This is the biggest disappointment of the year.  Where is Scarpetta?  This book is lame, boring, and drags on until you want to end up throwing the book out the window.  From the remedial conversations between underwater sea life and idiotic police officers you will have a hard time getting through this one.  Bring back Scarpetta and the quality of books we are use to.	2001-11-07

Iris Johansen had begun to make a name for herself in a new genre.  But in this book she reverts back to her roots of romance novels.  I would have preferred to stayed with the forensic anthropologist.  I felt it was deceptive in it's description.  It is more a romance novel than a thriller.  If you are looking for a good forensic thriller, I would skip this one and read her other book  &quot;Face of Deception&quot;.	2001-02-05

It is deceptive in it's description.  This is no more than lie filled meanderings from criminals who have been given too much air time already.  I never even  made it to the end of this book before I had to stop reading out of boredom. I do not recommend this to anyone interested in this genre.

Maybe they just weren't interesting enough for tv I don't know.  But in this review of some horrific cases we see the mindhunter disect them in a comprehensive way that opens the books on these cases and lays them out in a consice way. Excellant look into these case.  Although I feel the opinion of the mindhunter may not be what others may feel is what really happened, but keep your minds open and let the information speak for itself.	2001-01-18

He and Mr. Olshacker, have given us a deep insight to the people who commit horrific crimes and the whys, hows, and how they caught them.

This book was written by a man that I had heard about often from the former agents that used to work with him that had published before him.  I had been hoping he would write a book to enlighten us with his intellectual savy.  My patience has paid off.  I find that the compliments heaped on this man from former co-workers where well worth it.  This is a comprehensive book that can be easily read by anyone interested in this subject.

I have read all the books in the series.  After Benton's death I was certain that because of that shocking death of a old friend I would never read another book of hers again.  I know you are thinking I need help, but once you begin to read her books you will be hooked!  This was one book I put off for about one month. (Okay so I am not that strong of a person.)
