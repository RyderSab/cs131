US	43654378	RRV681UGR5HQG	1400062314	9571448	Prep: A Novel	Books	4	3	6	N	N	Enjoyable	If I have ever read a book with the potential to be my life story, this is it. <br /> <br />I am a student at a very prestigious Massachusetts boarding school, although not the one \\"Prep\\" is based on. I am not a Greenwich girl and my wardrobe, for the most part, does not consist of J. Crew and Polo. Like Lee Fiora, the book's main character, I had to convince my parents that leaving home at 14 was the best option for me. However, the one thing that sets me apart from Lee is that I thoroughly enjoy the daily life that my school atmosphere presents me with. <br /> <br />I found it very interesting to read about the events and relationships I see in one form or another every day at school. For the most part, Curtis Sittenfeld does an excellent job of portraying both the tragedies and triumphs of life at a boarding school. Perhaps my life is not always as dramatic as Lee's is, but I have certainly dealt with my fair share of kleptomaniacs, social climbers and eating disorders. Lee's character is honest, and the book is very well-written.  <br /> <br />Many of my classmates did not enjoy the book because in parts it becomes a tirade against boarding schools and turns very cliche. While there are certainly people like Lee at my school, they make up a very small percentage of the population. However, I enjoyed getting a different perspective on my high school experience. I would reccommend it to all high schoolers and adults, but take it with a grain of salt- it doesn't always portray the truth of boarding school life.	2005-03-14
US	43654378	RE4W365ER2NQH	0385333382	235106446	The Odd Sea	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A Powerful Journey	For weeks, this novel sat on my bookshelf, unnoticed and unassuming. A few days ago, I picked it up because it was on my summer reading list and my English teacher had reccommended it to me. I am very glad I did. <br /> <br />The Odd Sea by Frederick Reiken is a wonderful story about the effects of grief on a family and the power of letting go. The story is beautifully crafted, following Philip Shumway's 5-year journey to try to make sense of the disapperance of his older brother Ethan. Along the way, he sees the effects of his brother's disapperance on his depressed mother and distant father. He recieves new perspectives on the situation from his three sisters- brash, bitchy Amy, no-nonsense, understanding Halley, and naive, bubbly Dana. And he finally begins to understand what he never knew about Ethan's life, particularly about his relationships with his girlfriend Melissa and his mentor Victoria, as well as his love for art and the guitar.  <br /> <br />I was expecting to see many parallels to Homer's epic The Odyssey, and at first, I couldn't find them. After a while, I began to realize that this novel is not about the physical journey, but the mental and emotional one. Frederick Reiken has created a gem of a story with real characters in a vivid setting. I became engrossed in the story within just a few pages and couldn't put it down. If you enjoyed The Lovely Bones and want another perspective on the effects of death on a family, I would wholeheartedly reccommend this novel.	2004-07-24

Her two main goals in life were to avoid pregnancy and to get away. One summer, she accomplished both. Missy bought an old car and drove halfway across the country to Tuscon, Arizona- where with a new name (Taylor) and a new addition to her small family (an abandoned child named Turtle), Taylor started a new life.<br />The Bean Trees is an amazing novel. It follows Taylor's growth from a tough-girl-on-the-outside-but-really-afraid-inside girl to a responsible young mother. With the help of some new friends and Turtle, who really is an extrodinary girl, Taylor begins to realize that the world isn't as perfect as she used to think it was. Barbara Kingsolver has a way of writing that keeps you turning the page because you get so involved in the lives of the characters. I completely enjoyed this novel, and would recommend it to teens and adults everywhere.	2002-09-02

It tells the story of Paul Fisher, a seventh-grader who has just moved form Houston to Tangerine County, Florida. Paul is legally blind- he has to wear \\"Coke-bottle\\" glasses so that he can see. His parents tell people that Paul's eyes were damaged because he didn't listen and stared at a solar eclipse too long. Paul has always been overshadowed by his older brother Erik, placekicker extrodinare. He plays a part in the \\"Erik Fisher Football Dream\\"- but just what his part is remains to be seen. <br />When Paul moves to Tangerine, everything is different. Lightning knows where to strike. Schools get sucked up by sinkholes. People get killed- and no one really does anything about it. With the help of some friends, Paul sees the truth in things that other people seem blind to. Can Paul finally shake off the shadow of his older brother? In Tangerine, anything is possible. <br />Edward Bloor's first novel is well written and the plot keeps moving, keeping you constantly interested. I would reccommend it to any young adult looking for a good read.	2002-06-24

Because that's what this novel is all about. It's not all about waitressing, family, or love. The heart of the novel is rooted in hope and the belief that through the pain, things will get better. Hope was Here is a novel that will make an impact on you that will last forever.<br />Reccommended to all.	2002-06-20

But as Mexicans and hill people arrive on the farm to help the Chandlers harvest cotton, everything begins to change.

It tells the story of Colie Sparks, a fifteen year old \\"former fat girl\\" who is the daughter of world-famous Kiki Sparks, a fitness trainer and weight-loss inspirationist. Keeping the Moon chronicles a summer in Colie's life- the summer that Colie spends in Colby, North Carolina with her eccentric Aunt Mira. Along the way, Colie meets characters like Morgan and Isabel, two twenty-something waitresses who befriend her and help her through the summer, and Norman, the cook and art student who lives downstairs.<br />But Keeping the Moon is more than just the ordinary chronicle of a teenage summer. It's not all fluffy and romantic. It's inspirational. During the summer, the character of Colie completely changes and matures. It tells of her becoming beautiful, of her understanding Mira, Norman, Isabel, Morgan, and herself. I absolutely loved this book, and it's reccommended to everyone!	2002-03-28

The first one I picked up was The Fifth of March, a story of the Boston Massacre.<br />The Fifth of March follows the story of young Rachel Marsh, a teenage indentured servant in the home of John and Abigail Adams. Rachel is a loyal servant, but what she wants most in the world is to have a Place, like the women she admired have. Living in Boston, a rebellious city, during the years preceding the Revolution, Rachel had a lot of oppurtunities to make opinions about political situations. Many of her friends are Patriots, but Rachel also befriends Matthew Kilroy, a private in the British army. Rachel is forced to make many life-changing decisions throughout the course of the novel, and that is what makes the book so interesting. It's not all facts that I could recite straight out of my history textbook, but it has an interesting plot that keeps you interested in the story.<br />Don't get me wrong, as far as I could tell, the events in this book match up perfectly with history (and believe me, I know enough about the American Revolution to last a lifetime). Rachel Marsh herself was a real person, according to the author's note. And another thing that says wonders about the author: I am currently reading another of her novels, taking place in the same time period, and the stories are completely different. Ann Rinaldi has an extrodinary gift for writing about history in an interesting way, and I reccommend this novel to all!	2002-03-26

It tells the story of fifteen-year-old Elizabeth Clarry, a typical Australian teenager. Well, maybe she's not quite so typical. Basically, her only communication with her eccentric mother consists of post-its left on the refrigerator. Her father has reappeared in her life suddenly, and she's not quite sure what to think of him. Her best friend Celia has run away (again). And her English teacher, trying to rekindle the \\"Joy of the Envelope\\", is making his class write letters to a class at the local public school. Lucky for Elizabeth, she gets paired with Christina, and through their exchange of letters, Elizabeth and Christina build up an incredible friendship. <br />Though it might seem like a typical teen novel, what sets Feeling Sorry for Celia apart is the fact that it is written entirely in letters and notes from real people in Elizabeth's life, as well as fictitious organizations such as the Cold Hard Truth Association, and the Association of Teenagers. These letters show Elizabeth's fears and help to move the story along. This novel is full of twists and turns, romance and mysteries, and friendship. I absolutely loved this book, and I am eagerly awaiting more books by Jaclyn Moriarty!	2002-03-21
US	43654378	R25D8UT5BFWLUJ	0385729332	122662979	Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Amazing	Sure, the basis of the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, by Ann Brashares, may seem a bit weird, or even cheesy. After all it tells the story of magical Pants- ordinary thrift-shop jeans that miraculosly fit each of the four \\"sisters\\" perfectly. There's Lena, the beautiful, yet shy girl who is off to spend the summer in Greece with her grandparents. There's Bridget, the strong, sexy, and full-of-energy teenager who is heading to Baja California to participate in a prestigious soccer camp. There's Carmen, the saucy girl with a sometimes uncontrollable temper, off to spend the summer with her father, who she only sees once or twice a year. Then there's Tibby, the bold girl who is left at home all alone. Over the summer, the Pants travel the world, absorbing each of the sister's life-changing summer.<br />Somehow, I didn't find this book cheesy at all. Though I was expecting it to be a funny book (which it wasn't in most places),  I really enjoyed it. It told of typical teenage struggles- with love, courage, and just life in general. At some points it brought me close to tears, at others, it had me nearly screaming at the characters. But overall, this book was just simply heart-touching. The writing was plain and simple, and though Ann Brashares doesn't have a miraculous gift with words, she has a knack for knowing what teenage girls want to read. And she was able to write a powerful novel that I guarantee any young teenage girl will enjoy.	2002-03-16

Someone had heard good things about it, and we decided to read it. From the moment I read the first sentence, I knew I was going to love this book.<BR>The Mozart Season tells the incredible story of Allegra Shapiro, a twelve-year-old violinist. Her mother plays violin in the Symphony, and her father is an accomplished cellist. Naturally, Allegra picks up her parents' love for music. And she is quite good. She is picked to play Mozart's fourth concerto for violin at the Bloch Competition for young violinists in Oregon. The main plot of the story revolves around Allegra's struggles to master the piece before the Labor Day competition.<BR>But this book is so much more. It also tells of Deirdre, a wonderful but troubled singer who happens to be a friend of Mrs. Shapiro. It talks about Mr. Trouble, a mentally retarded man who is searching for his lost song. It tells of Allegra's struggles to cope with the horror of her great-grandmother's death. But most of all, The Mozart Season tells about Allegra. Allegra's triumphs, Allegra's failures. Allegra's laughs and her tears. And Allegra is one of the most inspiring people I have ever read about.	2002-03-12

Montgomery, and a few months ago, I was enchanted by Emily of New Moon. Of course, after reading that wonderful piece of literature, I HAD to read the sequels. When I finished Emily Climbs this morning, I was amazed at just how well L. M. Montgomery was able to capture the images of Emily's world. This volume in the Emily trilogy tells of her three years at Shrewsbury High School- her troubles, her triumphs, and most important of all, her promising literary career. This book sees the return of characters such as Ilse, Perry, Teddy, and Dean, as well as all the Murray relatives. There are, of course, other characters in Shrewsbury that come into play as well. The magic that L. M. Montgomery used to describe Emily's world and her adventures in Emily of New Moon has reappeared in this volume. This is one of Montgomery's best works, and it is reccomended to any L. M. Montgomery fan!	2002-03-11

It is the copy that was given to my 7th-grade honors English class a few weeks ago. Though I found the story a bit dull at times (what normal middle-schooler likes a book assigned for school), most of the sidenotes in this version were very helpful to me. This book offers an exact copy of Shakespeare's play, as well as sidenotes explaining words that are not used anymore. It also contains a lot of background information on the characters and a brief synopsis. In all, I would recommend this version to younger readers and students, as it offers a lot of helpful tools for better understanding of the play.	2002-02-27

The story of young Francie Nolan will touch your heart and forever change your view of life. A young girl growing up in the Brooklyn of the early 20th century, Francie had to face the many hardships of poverty as well as just growing up. Some of Francie's experiences are funny, and others almost brought me to tears. This book isn't famous for the phenomanal writing style of Betty Smith, because the book is written plainly and simply. Smith doesn't mince words getting to her points, but shows the life of Francie plainly and bluntly. From selling junk to earn a few extra cents, to an interesting fishing trip, Francie's life is just so different. This probably ranks number 2 on my list of all-time favorite books, right behind The View From Saturday. You haven't lived life completely until you have read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. I would reccomend it to all girls over twelve or thirteen, because some of Francie's experiences are a bit inappropriate for some younger readers. A must-read!	2002-02-25

I mean, what thirteen-year-old ENJOYS vacation reading? I, for one, do not, but I have read much better books assigned for school. Out of the Dust tells the story of Billie Jo Kelby, a teenage girl who lives in the Oklahoma panhandle, otherwise known as the Dust Bowl. It is a story written in poetry, which actually made it a lot better (which is why it got 3 stars instead of 2) and easier to get through. Billie Jo's life isn't very good. Her mother dies giving birth to her baby brother, and Billie Jo's hands get badly injured in an unfortunate accident. Her scarred and sore hands make it impossible for her to do the one thing that might make her feel better, play the piano. <br />The story tells of Billie Jo's desparate desires to please her father, while getting closer to him, and to escape the dust that is ruining her life. I like the main idea of the plot, but I think Karen Hesse took most of the story in the wrong direction. I can think of about a million different ways that I would change the plot to make it better. However, the ending mostly makes up for the incredibly poor middle of the book. <br />Billie Jo is a strong character, full of courage and desire. This story is certainly inspirational, and it makes you see how lucky you really are. I would reccommend it to anyone ages 11 and up, even though I didn't really like it that much. It is one of those books that will teach you something, no matter how much you like it.	2002-01-07

I got this book for Christmas, and I whipped through it in about three days. I found it to be quite amusing, mostly because of the author's continuing commentary on just how depressing the book was. The characters may not be the most well-developed or unique that have ever been created, but I found the story just plain funny. One thing I must say I did not like about it was how the author kept defining words in their context in the story. That was unneccessary, and it got very annoying when words that most kids know were defined over and over again. If you have heard that this is as good as Harry Potter, well, it's not. Not many books are as good as Harry Potter. But The Bad Beginning is a good book to fill the time, and I reccommend it to anyone who is looking for a good laugh.	2002-01-02

She had lost all that was familiar to her, yet she managed to pull through difficult times alone. Koly's independence and strength is an inspiration to anyone, and I reccomend it to anyone looking to see just how lucky we are.	2001-12-28

With all of the current hype about the Lord of the Rings, I decided to read both that trilogy, and its predecessor, The Hobbit. I haven't quite gotten to the Fellowship of the Ring, but if it is even half as good as this book, I will be overjoyed.<br />The Hobbit tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, who is, well, a hobbit. The wizard Gandalf and the dwarf Thorin, along with the rest of the company of dwarves, came to the doorstep of Bilbo's respectable hobbit-hole in the Shire, in need of a burglar on their &quot;adventure&quot; to regain the treasure currently in the possession of the great dragon Smaug. Reluctantly, Bilbo agrees to the journey.<br />J.R.R. Tolkein weaves a wonderful story, following Bilbo's adventure. Along the way, Bilbo and his counterparts meet trolls, goblins, elves, humans, giant spiders, and many other dangers. As Bilbo learns more about being a burglar and going on adventures, he slowly gains the respect of his comrades. And in the end, it was Bilbo alone who took the weight of the company, when worse came to worse.<br />This is a classic tale, one that has already been immortalized in literary history.

Her mother's family draws lots to decide who should take Emily in, and the lot fell to the Murrays of New Moon. Stern Aunt Elizabeth, loving Aunt Laura, and simple Cousin Jimmy brought Emily to New Moon Farm, where she had all sorts of adventures and basically just learned the lessons of life. Emily is a young heroine who many can relate to.<br />L. M. Montgomery has written another beautiful novel.

I had read enough mysteries and trashy books about romance to last me a lifetime. So I wanted something else to read, something well-written with a good plot and lifelike characters. I had to look no further than the first book I picked up- Anne of Green Gables by L. M. Montgomery.<br />Anne of Green Gables is the first book in the Anne of Green Gables series. It takes place, as most of L. M. Montgomery's books do, on Prince Edward Island in Canada. This particular story takes place in the town of Avonlea. It follows young Anne Shirley, an orphan brought to Green Gables to help Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert on their farm. Much to Anne's dismay, Marilla tells her that they wanted a boy to help around the farm, not a girl. However, Marilla changes her mind and decides to keep the dynamic young girl who would become Anne of Green Gables.<br />This novel is incredibly written, with well-developed characters and an intricate plot. I absolutely loved it. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great example of children's literature at its height.	2001-11-23

I believe this is the twelfth book I have read by her. I have loved each and every book I have read by her, but somehow, the Ransom of Mercy Carter seems to stand out. It's different from her other novels, deeper, almost. The Ransom of Mercy Carter tells the story of, well, Mercy Carter, an eleven year old girl whose town (Deerfield, Massachusetts) is destroyed by Indians in 1704. She and many other children from Deerfield are forced to march to Canada on their own foot power. Mercy, at the tender age of eleven, saw terrible hardships- scalpings, murder, kidnap, her life being pulled from her in an instant. <br />Mercy hated to see this happen, but she was one of the first children to begin to accept the Indian culture. She was among the first to be given a Mohawk name, and among the first to learn the Mohawk language. When Mercy is brought into a Mohawk town in Canada, she begins to accept the culture. And the question is- if ransom ever comes, will Mercy accept it?<br />This story touched my heart in many ways. It was another Cooney masterpiece, well-written and suspenseful. But this book was somehow different. It wasn't the typical mystery of Cooney, it was something more. It was a heartfelt yet historic story, and it has me thirsty for more information about Mercy Carter and the children of Deerfield. For me, the novel is now more meaningful for me (three years later) because I now attend school in Deerfield and better understand the history of the place. I would reccommend this book to anyone, boy or girl, young or old or anywhere in between, who is looking for a great novel that will have you thinking for days.	2001-11-21

Cooney's Losing Christina trilogy, is just as good as the first, Fog. This time, the Shevvington's target is apparantely Dolly, Christina's best friend from the island who is a year younger than herself. After losing Anya to the Shevvingtons, Christina does all she can to hold on to Dolly. Much to her dismay, very few people believe her evidence about the Shevvingtons. Not her parents, not Dolly's brothers, not Dolly herself. The only ones who believe it are Christina's best friend, Jonah, and a few other of her classmates who have felt the wrath of the Shevvingtons. This is a fantastic sequel, and a high point is the reappearance of Blake, Anya's boyfriend. I would reccomend this book to anyone who has read the  first book in the trilogy (a must) and who is looking for a fantastic mystery and all-around good story.	2001-11-19

I have read at least 10 of her other books before this one, and I have loved each and every page of every single one of them. This is no exception.<br />Fog is the first book in the Losing Christina trilogy. It tells the story of Christina, a thirteen-year-old seventh-grader who is coming off of her Maine island, Burning Fog Isle, to attend school on the mainland. She along with 3 other island natives board on the mainland with the school principal, Mr. Shevvington, and his wife, an English teacher. <br />Fog tells of Christina's self-proclaimed war with the Shevvingtons. They seem to hate her from the start. And to make things worse, slowly, slowly, slowly...another island boarder, Anya, seems to be losing her mind. And Christina knows who is behind it- the Shevvingtons.  <br />This story is fantastic, page-turning, and, I must warn you, addictive. I finished it in only three or four days, and I loved every minute I spent immersed within its pages. I have not yet read the next two books in the trilogy, Snow and Fire, but they are sitting in my bedroom, awaiting me. I would wholeheartedly reccomend this book, and any of Caroline B. Cooney's others, to anyone wishing for an excellent, suspenseful read!	2001-11-04
US	43654378	R2QANPZVATKKWS	0380719002	563581540	Stepping on the Cracks	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Great Insights	I have read so many books pertaining to World War II, but none of them has had such an effect on me than Stepping on the Cracks. Stepping on the Cracks is about two young girls named Margaret and Elizabeth living in College Hill. College Hill is a town that has been thrown apart by war- young boys everywhere are off at war, and a few have even already been killed. Jimmy, Maragaret's brother, and Joe, Elizabeth's brother, are among those off at war. The story shows how the events and battles in Europe and Asia affect life back at home in the average American town.<br />One of the reasons this book has set itself apart from others I have read is that it gives an American child's point of view. Almost all of the other books I have read have been about the Holocaust- from both Jewish and Christian children and adult's point of views. There is hardly a word mentioned about the Holocaust in this book. Battles are mentioned as letters come home, giving blow-by-blow accounts, but the main story is focused on a little war going on in College Hill.<br />Elizabeth and Margaret's worst enemy is Gordy Smith, and they are trying to get revenge on him for something he did. So they follow him to his &quot;secret hideout&quot; where they find quite a surprise- Gordy has been hiding his brother Stuart, a deserter, from his parents and the rest of the town. When Stuart gets sick, Elizabeth and Margaret join forces with Gordy to help Stuart get better and protect him from his harsh, criminal father.<br />Perhaps it is simply because of the times we are in now that made me like this book so much. Somehow, all the other books on World War II I have read have always seemed impossible, that such a thing could never happen again. The events of September 11th have proved that such a thing CAN happen again, and to the great country of America nonetheless. This book helped me to understand what could, but hopefully will not, happen to my life. I just hope that it never will.	2001-10-17

I picked up The Princess Diaries by Meg Cabot after seeing the movie starring Anne Hatahway and Julie Andrews Edwards, which I loved, and I couldn't put it down! Meg Cabot's &quot;debut&quot; book was fantatstic. This book was funny, it was entertaining, and it actually had some very good points in it about discrimination and friendship. If you have seen the movie and liked it, or are in need of a good laugh, The Princess Diaries is the book for you!	2001-09-21

It tells the story of Susan Caraway, better known as Stargirl. Stargirl enters Mica High School as a sophmore, after being home-schooled for the previous 10 years. Stargirl is much different than other people. She strums her ukelele in the school cafeteria, brings her rat Cinnamon to school with her, and she wears period clothing sewn by her own mother. In the words of 16-year-old narrator Leo Borlock, &quot;She was elusive. She was today. She was tomorrow. She was the faintest scent of a cactus flower, the flitting shadow of an elf owl. We did not know what to make of her. In our minds we tried to pin her to corkboard like a butterfly, but the pin merely went through and away she flew.&quot;<BR>This book tells the story of unconformity, of love, of popularity, and of kindness. Stargirl shows that things like love and kindness are better qualities then beauty and popularity. A red apple amongst a sea of green, Stargirl sticks out like a sore thumb. Though her popularity soars at the beginning, her deep kindness for others destroyed it. Cheering for the other team, sending mysterious cards, and just plain being nice set her apart from everyone else. This novel shows that sometimes the unpopular people are the ones that can teach you the most, and if you haven't read Stargirl, you are seriously missing out on something!	2001-08-30

However, I was immeadiatly transported to Carthak, where Daine is part of a peace delegation from Tortall. There mainly because the Emperor's prized birds are sick, Daine soon discovers that the gold and glitter of the Imperial Palace is not all it seems. Some evil is lurking, and omens from the gods seem to seal the fact that Carthak is in trouble. Daine, with old familiar faces such as those of Alanna and Numair as well as new friends in Lindhall and Prince Kaddar, set to fight this evil force. With help from the Gods, and Daine's terryfying new wild magic, the battle begins. Another spectacular Pierce book, Emperor Mage follows in the footsteps of the Lioness quartet and the first two books in the Immortals series. Reccomended to all fantasy lovers!	2001-08-26
US	43654378	RJCI5D7I5PEQ1	0590205242	954920621	True North	Books	5	2	3	N	N	FANTASTIC	True North, by Kathryn Lasky, is one of the best books I have read about the Underground Railroad. It tells the parallel stories of Lucy Bradford, the youngest daughter of a well-to-do Boston family, and Afrika, a fourteen-year-old slave girl who is escaping on the Underground Railroad. As the story moves on, the two girl's lives grow closer together, as Lucy discovers a well-kept secret that her grandfather is involved in the Underground Railroad. As Lucy is trying to avoid the seemingly endless parties leading up to her sister Iris's wedding, Afrika is sleeping by day and walking miles upon miles at night, following the stars and the moss to reach Canada and freedom. Kathryn Lasky wrote a masterpiece here, interweaving fact with fiction to create a highly educational and enjoyable story.	2001-08-21

I got this book for my birthday four months ago, and I have read a story almost every night. The stories in these books are written by teens, for teens. Stories about everything from bilingual relationships to suicide attempts. I have also read Teen 1 &amp;2 as well as Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul letters. Letters from readers tell about how hearing that they were not alone saved some people from suicide, salvaged relationships and healed those whose hearts were broken. Obviously, the stories in these books are quite powerful, and though sad, I would put this on a must-have list for teens of all shapes and sizes.	2001-08-15
US	43654378	RS2E0R0DATUUH	015200372X	389810024	The Primrose Way	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Interesting account	The Primrose Way, by Jackie French Koller, was the book required for all seventh-graders to read over the summer at my school. Though I am usually drawn to books written about this time period, I had never heard about this book. The Primrose Way is the story of Rebekah, a sixteen-year-old girl coming to Massachusetts Bay Colony from England in the 1630s. Rebekah is one of those rebellious girls who doesn't really belong in the time period where women were not given much power. Once she arrived at Agawam, now known as Ipswich, Rebekah was curious to find out what the savages were all about. This story tells of Rebekah's quest to find the meaning of the savages, the meaning of her religion, and the meaning of what it means to be a person. I would reccomend this book to any young adult, particularly someone who is interested in the settling of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.	2001-08-14
US	43654378	R1PU2F5A9Y0KDG	0425102416	602354563	Across Five Aprils	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Interesting, but boring in places	I read Across Five Aprils only because it was on my summer reading list (entering seventh grade). The subject matter is not something I am usually drawn towards, but as American history dominates my seventh grade year, many books about war ended up on the list. Across Five Aprils is about the Creighton family, a typical family living on a farm in southern Illinois during the turbulent years of the American Civil War. The story opens on the  days immeaditly before the outbreak of war. Jethro Creighton, then only nine years old, is very confused. He doesn't know what to expect of war, and he is very unprepared for what happens to his family in the next five years. Torn apart by war, Jethro must deal with all the problems a man faces during a time of war, as well as his own, internal problems. <br />This book has a good mix of historical events and ficitional scenes. Many of the battles that took place are described in letters to Jethro and his family, coming from his brothers at war. It is written in rural dialect, as this family would have spoken back in the 1860's, which is at times quite hard to understand. Though I did enjoy the book, I would reccomend it solely to those people who have a great interest in this time period.	2001-08-12
US	43654378	R1GJBDXA6MGP3D	0689817215	491485249	The View from Saturday	Books	5	155	167	N	N	Simply Phenomanal	Let's get right to business. The View from Saturday, by E. L. Kningsburg, is my favorite book ever. I have read it countless times, borrowing whosever's copy was closest. I finally bought my own copy about a month ago, and it is already getting worn out, because I have turned the pages so many times.<br />One of the reasons that this book is set apart from all other books is the subject material, and how it is written. It is about the sixth grade Academic Bowl team, and how they became a true team. The story line struck quite close to home for me. A member of academic teams myself, and someone who just completed the sixth grade, Koningsburg's descriptions of the hard work that is put into preparing for this kind of event is quite accurate. Also, the diversity of her team is also shockingly accurate. Each person has a distinctly different personality, which is always true. If each personality is different, it is so much easier to make a team out of 4 kids.<br />The View from Saturday is a book that really touches upon things that aren't usually brought up very often. Most people I know have loved this book, but none as much as me. I think that once you have read this book, it gives you a whole new outlook on life. You see people in a different light- eccentric people, troublemakers, almost everyone I know I can relate to one of these characters. I read this book in the fourth grade for the first time. Now, in the seventh, I feel that the book itself has changed. Able to relate it to my everyday life, I can see not only how Mrs. Olinski picked her team, but how the people on my team got there. I would wholeheartedly reccomend this book to anyone who can read it, but especially kids in 6th grade or older, so they can get the full meaning of this wonderful work of literature.	2001-08-12
US	43654378	R107CDGBIKH8AE	1571316248	109610847	The Ocean Within	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Touching and Revealing	This was another one of those book discussion books. Reccomended to me by a close friend, I picked up The Ocean Within by V. M. Caldwell. This book tells the wonderful story of Elizabeth, an orphan who has been shipped around from foster family to foster family. Finally, Elizabeth meets the Sheridans, a family who wants to adopt her. However, Elizabeth shuts out all the love that the family gives her, when she spends a month with all the kids of the family, because of the great emotional loss that she has suffered. Even 4-year-old Petey, who calls her Turtle to remind him of her shyness, can't completely break down the barrier that stands between Elizabeth and the rest of the world. Even the ocean, the one thing Elizabeth always dreamed of, doesn't make her happy enough to break through her shell. This was the first book I had read about this type of experience, and I found it to be quite touching and revealing. Caldwell wrote this book in a fantastic fashion, showing the true emotions of Elizabeth and all of the Sheridans. This book was phenomanal, and I would openly recommend this book to any and all young adults looking for a good read.	2001-07-26

OK, let's get straight to the point- Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone ranks quite high among my list of favorite books. I first got hooked in fourth grade, when my friend INSISTED that I read this book, and wouldn't stop bugging me until I had read the last page. And it didn't take me long to do it. The story of an eleven-year-old wizard was particularly appealing to my 10-year-old Muggle self. The captivating story of Harry Potter, the nobody-turned-famous, caught my attention from the very first page. As soon as baby Harry was left on that doorstep, I left my couch behind and was suddenly transported into the world of British wizards. I felt as if I could taste those pepper-flavored Every Flavor Beans along with Harry and Ron. J. K. Rowling is a spectacular author: her action-packed books are well-written and detailed.<br />Naturally, Harry Potter craze soon took over. I have read all 4 books that have come out so far, as well as the filler &quot;schoolbooks&quot;...in fact, my mother is reading Chapter 3 of this book to my younger sister as I write this review. It was not much later that I discovered the next great thing in the Harry Potter line- audio tapes. My family currently owns the audio tape sets of books 1-4. Jim Dale's voice gives this magical story a new twist. His wonderful voices for all of the characters make the story much more lively and exciting. Car rides are no longer boring (or eventful- a word of advice--audio tapes are a great distraction for otherwize carsick riders!) Both book and audio tapes are phenomenal, and I would reccomend them to readers age 6 to 136!	2001-07-24

Grace, by Jill Paton Walsh, was another one of those illustrious titles on my seventh-grade summer reading list. I bought it, and picked it up just 2 days ago to read for a discussion. Though I had heard things about it being &quot;slow&quot;, &quot;boring&quot;, and &quot;confusing&quot;, I found none of these to be true. I whipped through the book in 2 days flat and was amazed at this heart-warming tale of heroism. Grace Darling, a 22-year-old daughter of a lighthouse keeper, was on the morning watch one stormy day when she sighted the wreck of the Forfarshire. She and her father rescued the survivors of the wreck, and Grace became a national hero. In this telling of the tale, the author weaves fact with fiction to tell a truly believeable tale of a young lady who, against all odds, saved 9 lives. The novel also tells the tale of Grace's life after the rescue- suddenly flung into the public eye of Great Britain. This book is a great read for young adults, and I reccommend it to all!	2001-07-20

Lyra and Will, the heroes from earlier books, face even greater challenges in this edition. Great discoveries about Dust are made, and we see returns of favorite characters, including Mary Malone, Serefina Pekkala, Iorek Byrnison, and &quot;bad guys&quot; Mrs. Coulter and Lord Asriel. The witches' prophecy is fulfilled, and Lyra and Will must journey into the dankest, darkest world yet- the world of the Dead. Some friends, who had died in previous books, make a reapearance. New friends and allies are met, including Balthamos, Chevalier Tialys and the Lady Salmakia. A great story of sacrifice, adventure, love, friendship, allies, and just about everything else, The Amber Spyglass is sure to thrill all who turn these pages.	2001-07-18

Though it is called a companion novel to The Giver, Lowry's earlier book about a future Utopian society, Gathering Blue is by no means a sequel. It follows the life of Kira, an orphan girl with a twisted leg trying to survive in a society that shuns and discards the weak. After her mother dies, Kira faces a life or death trial in front of the Council of Guardians. She is given the important job of being the threader of the sacred Singer's Robe. There, she meets Thomas the Carver, little Jo, the future Singer, and Matt, a troublesome tyke. This novel makes you think of where our current society is heading, and what we will become if we do- a greedy, self-centered world with no diversity and much power. Gathering Blue is a wonderfully written book that is sure to make you wonder how you can prevent this society from coming into full existence.	2001-07-08

It follows the story of Jessie, a teenage girl who finds that her whole life has been a lie. She believes that she lives in the 1800s, in a village called Clifton. However, she discovers the shocking truth when a diptheria epidemic strikes the village, and Jessie is flung into the outside world, searching for the medicine that will save the ill children. An action-packed story, Running Out of Time has been a favorite of all that have read it. I highly reccommend it to young adults and adults alike.	2001-07-01

Though it does have some good advice for girls, I found that the situations in the book were not ones that girls face on an everyday basis. Some of the advice, particularly on sibilings, friends, and homework, is quite helpful for certain situations. But some, like the ones on freckles, teddy bears, and roller coasters, are quite unnecessary. This book is a take-it-or-leave-it, definitly not an indipensable book.	2001-07-01

There, he meets Lyra Belaqua, the hero of book one. Together, Will and Lyra explore two worlds together, in search of Will's father. Along the way, they meet old friends, with the return of Serafina Pekkala and Lee Scoresby, new friends, such as Dr. Mary Malone, old enemies, in Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter, and new enemies, in Sir Charles and the Specters. They also make important discoveries, both in the field of Dust and finding new and important tools in their everlasting fight. A powerful novel, the Subtle Knife will leave you waiting in anguish for the conclusion of the trilogy, The Amber Spyglass.	2001-06-15
