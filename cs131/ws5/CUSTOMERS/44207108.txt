While more &quot;truthful&quot; than Leslie Nielson's A Liar's Autobiography, The Hologram's Handbook is similar in tone and manner, told by a person who is rarely able to look beyond the mirror.  The Doctor tells us organics just how things really are, and how they should be.  Everything we love about The Doctor is here - from the biting sarcasm to the Data-esque desire to experience humanity.  If you're like me and think The Doctor was the best (and perhaps the only truly great) part of Voyager, then this one is a must read.	2004-06-08

The bulk of the stories are classic military sci-fi, with soldiers taking on vicious aliens.  Very good stuff, and each story is well-written.  As shared universe anthologies go, this one ranks up there with the best Thieves' World collection.<br />The only let-down comes from Piers Anthony.  His story &quot;Soft Like a Woman&quot; is well-done, with just the right amount of action and dramatic tension.  However, Anthony reveals his on-going obsession with perceived chauvinism.  His main character is insulted, degraded, and ignored because she is a woman, and she complains that her gender is keeping her from being taken seriously in the Fleet.  The only problem is that several other stories in the book featured women in prominent, &quot;masculine&quot; roles: combat platoon leader (Christopher Stasheff), pilot (Janny Wurts), commander (Jody Lynn Nye), to name just a few.  Anthony's political tirade mars an otherwise excellent story.	2004-06-03

Kirk and the gang go to a pre-warp planet, one which the Federation has been in touch with for decades (so much for the Prime Directive).  Meanwhile, something is going on with Miri and the &quot;Onlies&quot; back on that planet that oh so coincidentally looks exactly like Earth.  Just what that something is, I can't say as I didn't make it that far.  Trek books are supposed to be mindless entertainment; this one was just mindless.	2004-06-01

As the years went by, the whole series faded into dim memory.  So, when I began to read Myth-Ion Improbable I found myself trying to compare it to . . . what?  Was the Myth series really as good as I remember it being?  Ultimately, I gave up trying to fit this one into the rest of the series and decided to evaluate it on its own merits, such as they are.<br />Asprin gives us an interesting, if poorly developed, plot involving cow vampires in a Western-style universe (sort of a spoiler there, but it's fairly obvious well before Skeeve figures it out).  There are some amusing bits here, but only a few rise to the level of actual knee-slapping.  What we end up with is a short novel that can be read in a couple of hours without in any way energizing or taxing the brain cells.  Pure, mindless, harmless fluff.  <br />If you haven't read any of the Myth books, don't start with this one as you'll be left wondering what the big deal is.  If you're a huge Myth fan, avoid this one, too; you will no doubt end up enraged like so many other reviewers.  If, however, you remember the Myth series fondly but not passionately you could do much worse than this one.	2004-05-17

Villains of all sorts triumph here, from familiar fiends such as Moriarty or the Evil Queen from fairy-tale legends to previously unheard of crooks, criminals, and cranks.  Not every story is a rousing success.  Rosemary Edghill's &quot;The Mould of Form&quot; is an extremely dull account of the beginning of Captain Hook's career, for example.  But many are quite good, including Tanya Huff's &quot;All Things Being Relative&quot; (starring the aforementioned Evil Queen), Kristine Kathryn Rusch's &quot;Doubting Thomas&quot; (which will prevent you from ever seeing Santa the same way again), and Pauline Dungate's &quot;Nina&quot; (reminiscent of a dark Bend It Like Beckham).  Particularly powerful is Tim Waggoner's <BR>&quot;Horror Show&quot; featuring a washed-up horror movie actor coming literally face to face with his career.<br />This is the first Ace paperback anthology in a long, long while I intend to actually keep for future reading.  It is well worth the time of any and all fantasy and horror fans.	2004-05-15

This collection is supposed to be a celebration of Daw's 30th anniversary, yet none of the stories are standouts and several, including Zahn's and Frederik Pohl's, seem to have &quot;phoned in.&quot;  Even C.J.

There are plenty of plot twists and turns, and a surprising amount of suspense given that we know that both Chekov and the Enterprise will survive whatever is hurled at them.  Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are little more than background characters, a change which is both refreshing and disappointing (after all, it's not really a Trek book without at least *one* insult between Spock and McCoy!).  Graf returns to the Uhura/Sulu/Chekov theme in Traitor Winds, a slighly better effort.<br />Nitpick of the day:  The uniforms.  The novel has to take place after Star Trek I, as Kirk's in command, Chekov's security chief, and Sulu is still helmsman.  So, we should be seeing the gray/white duds from The Motion Picture.  Yet the cover has everyone in the burgundy of Star Trek II-VI, and the text refers to &quot;command gold&quot; and &quot;security red&quot;!  How very, very irritating . . . . .	2004-05-03

Excellently paced, well-crafted, and evocative this is a book to read and treasure.  Intended to be a retelling of a Grimm fairy tale in which a girl must save her six brothers who have been turned into swan, Daughter of the Forest never strays into silliness or pathos (although it does come close to the latter at a few points).  One might expect an estrogen-powered book ala Bradley's Avalon given the title and cover; instead one gets a fantasy tale that can be enjoyed by either gender.	2004-04-29

This book is about Caesar and the Republic, not about &quot;his women&quot; who play a relatively marginal role at best.  Oh, sure, we see a lot of Caesar's lover (and Brutus' mother) Servilia, mommy dearest Aurelia, and a near invisible wife or two, but none of them really factor into the novel, which focuses on Caesar's rise in the Republican heiarchy.  Apart from Caesar, only Cicero receives extensive treatment, and McCullough's Cicero is an extremely well-rounded sort - all too human at times, both brilliant and insecure.  The entire decade of the 60s BC is covered to fine effect, and if the ending (with &quot;Caesar's women&quot; finding out that Caesar has left to fight the Helvetii) is a tad (no, a lot) contrived, the novel remains well worth the time of anyone with an interest in Roman history.	2004-04-25

One reviewer has even compared The Fearful Summons to the dreaded Triangle - there can be no greater insult to a Trek writer!  In reality, Flinn has brought us an extremely delightful Trek book - think the flavor of Next Gen's &quot;All Good Things. . . &quot; but with the original crew.  Kirk in particular is well-developed here, true to the way we see him in Star Trek VI without being a caricature.  <br />As in &quot;All Good Things. . . &quot; the crew of the Enterprise (this time -A instead of -D, of course) have gone their separate ways.  When Captain Sulu is captured by a pseudo-Ferengi race, Kirk rounds up his shipmates one by one to go on a rescue mission.  Along the way Kirk manages to get some female action (in a PG-13 setting), McCoy complains, Scotty tells tall tales, and Spock . . . well, Spock doesn't do much, but what he does do, he does logically.  In short, there's a bit of everything in here that most Trek fans love about the original series.<br />There certainly are flaws.  Despite writing in 1995 or 1996, Flinn appears to be completely oblivious to the events of Generations, which means an opportunity to show Demora Sulu is wasted, and there some plot holes one could fly a Galaxy class starship through.  However, since one should never expect more than entertainment from a Trek book, the flaws are minor compared to an extremely satisfying Trek novel.<br />One final note - Pocket strikes again with poor packaging.  This one is hardly a sequel to Star Trek VI.  Other than taking place a year or so after the movie, the novel has no connection whatsoever to The Undiscovered Country.	2004-04-01

Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan must track down an evil scientist and confront a deadly bounty hunter in an adventure guaranteed to satisfy even the most demanding of readers.  The Dangerous Rescue also features the return of Adi Gallia (one of the council members seen in Episode I) and her abrasive Padawan, Siri.  There's drama, suspense, intrigue - in short, everything one could hope for except a bit of romance (but, after all, as the ads for Episode II told us, a Jedi may not know love . . . .).	2004-03-29

Briskly paced, well-written, and characters as true to the originals as in any TOS novel.  The plot is in many ways a liberal re-working The Undiscovered Country, with Enterprise crewmembers framed for a conspiracy involving high levels of the Federation and Starfleet, and a denouement at a peace conference to boot.

The series title is somewhat misleading; this is not a look at every day life in feudal Japan.  Rather, the text reads exactly like a high school text book: not dumbed down, but not terribly in-depth, either.  We are given a rough summary of the politics of Japan from about 1000 to about 1700, with a few pages dedicated to each of the founders of the various &quot;dynasties&quot; (my word) to control Japan, including Michinaga, Takauji, and Ieyasu (better known to the American public as James Clavell's Toranaga).  Those looking for a rough outline of Japanese history would be well-served to get this one.	2004-03-27

Dracula.  Loren Estelman does a good job of capturing the spirit and language of the original Doyle series if the idea is somewhat hokey, the execution is not.  The events of the novel intertwine with those in Bram Stoker's novel (indeed, Watson makes a point of lambasting Stoker for maliciously omitting mention of Holmes), but readers need only have seen any of the many Dracula movies to follow the characters.  This is not a book that will enter anybody's top ten lists, but it is exactly what it appears to be - mindless entertainment.	2004-03-25
US	44207108	R1W6ZN0XSDWAH	0748603174	33054220	The Trotsky Reappraisal	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Outstanding for the Specialist	This is not a book for the Russian history novice.  If the names Rykov and Preobrazhensky mean nothing to you, then put this one back on the shelf.  Every essay in this collection assumes that the reader already has an intimate knowledge of the Bolshevik Revolution - which makes sense, since all of the essays were originally presented at an academic Trotsky symposium in 1990.<br />The essays themselves range from the provocative (e.g., George Klines &quot;The Defence of Terrorism&quot;) to the pointless (Richard Day's comparison of Trotsky's and Hegel's views to that of somebody named Habermas; only an academic who hasn't stepped foot out of his musty office in decades could care).  There are some well-known heavyweights here like Richard Daniels, and several Russian, Italian, and German scholars largely unknown the American laity.  Topics include Trotsky's relations, his famous train, his alienation from the Bolshevik party, his views on culture, revolution, and just about everything in between.<br />If you're looking to find out just who this Trotsky guy was, you should turn to the classic three-volume biography by Isaac Deutscher.  Fifty years after it was written, nobody has been able to match it.  It truly ranks as one of the greatest biographies of all time, for its style, scope, and subject.  After you've had your fill of Deutscher, pick up the Trotsky Reappraisal as an after-dinner aperitif.	2004-03-25

The novel is excellently paced and marks a true turning point in Obi-Wan's development.  With Qui-Gon held prisoner by a mad scientist, Obi-Wan must head the search for his missing master and take command in situations where previously he followed Qui-Gon's lead.  Here, we for the first time see the fully-mature Jedi that Obi-Wan will become by Episode I, and yet this Obi-Wan is also true to the Kenobi who has been growing through the first eleven books.  Nobody has ever captured Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan better than Watson at her best, and probably nobody ever will.<br />As for the rest of the novel, it is a treat for all.  There is a compelling bad guy (bad woman, actually), an enigmatic, powerful bounty hunter, heroism, courage, sacrifice, and a few philosophical discussions to boot.  This may very well be the best entry in the Jedi Apprentice yet.  It is so good, I immediately reread most of it once I had finished.  I haven't done that with a book in a long, long time.	2004-03-20

It is, however, easily the most dull and bears no relation whatsoever in terms of style or quality to Foster's classic Splinter of the Mind's Eye.  Apart from the similarity of names on the cover, there is nothing in this one to suggest the two novels were written by the same man.<br />Obi-Wan and Anakin have to go to a planet named Ansion to try to prevent it from seceding from the Republic.  Once there, they meet the incredibly cardboard characters of Luminara and her Padawan Bariss, as well as a couple of equally uninspiring locals.  After a dull, dull, dull trip through the countryside, they convince Ansion's leaders to stay in the Republic.  I apologize for giving way the secret ending, but, frankly, this book is so tedious that nobody will mind hearing that the end is blatantly obvious.<br />Beyond the tedium, there are other flaws.  The viewpoint changes too frequently, often within the same paragraph.  At times, the novel seems like it was intended as an entry in the Jedi Quest series, reading like a very young adult book.  Moreover, Foster was tasked with writing a book that takes place immediately before Episode II without having seen the movie.  Accordingly, neither Anakin nor Obi-Wan feel right, Shu Mai (the &quot;lady&quot; who accuses Dooku of treason in Episode II) is playing the wrong role, and Anakin keeps pining for some unspecified place or thing (nothing in here about the dreams with his mother, either).  I recognize that Foster's not to blame for his ignorance of how the movie would turn out, but the effect is, nevertheless, to further lessen any enjoyment to be had in an overall drab novel.<br />Foster's Splinter of the Mind's Eye is much, much more engrossing, despite its apocryphal ending.  Cloak of Deception is a far, far more effective lead in to Episode I than this one is to Episode II.  In short, if you see The Approaching Storm coming take cover.	2004-03-19

With The Humanoid Touch, he revives the humanoids - robots whose Prime Directive is to protect Man from harm.  The Humanoids debuted in &quot;With Folded Hands&quot; in the late 1940s (which I've read) and in the novel The Humanoids (which I've not).  In The Humanoid Touch, a last bastion of humanity tries to hide from or fight against the inevitable humanoid advance.<br />Williamson's humanoids are provocative in every sense.  What happens when robots become too perfect, no matter how &quot;benevolent&quot; their intentions?  There is a latent horror throughout the book as the characters realize the humanoids are near.  Williamson succeeds in creating the aura of fear that Saberhagen hints at with his Berserkers, or Star Trek with the Borg.  Williamson's humanoids, however, are far more terrifying than either - who would have thought the words &quot;At your service&quot; could induce such spine-tingling horror?<br />The human characters more or less get in the way of the true protagonists, and here is where Williamson's skills perhaps aren't quite up to snuff.  The interaction and personal relationships between characters is not much more advanced than in his 1930s pulp sci-fi Legion series (a nevertheless fine read).  And the ending doesn't sit right; it's on the one hand too pat, and on the other too troubling - I can't say more without divulging spoilers.<br />All in all, however, this one ranks as a must read by all science fiction fans.  The humanoids are among sci-fi's greatest creations, easily the equal of Dune's Fremen or Asimov's psychohistory.  If you thought the Borg were creepy, you haven't seen anything until you've seen the humanoids.	2004-03-15

It's clearly intended as popular history, no more and no less.  And on that level it succeeds.  Anybody who already has more than passing knowledge of Ancient Rome would do well to skip it, however.  &quot;As seen on the Discovery Channel&quot; sums it up - you can hear the narrative voice-over just before each commercial break:  &quot;Coming up next, the life of a gladiator was a cruel one.  Could this woman found outside London have voluntarily subjected herself to it, or was she a slave captive forced to fight to entertain her captors?  Find out after this word from Avon.&quot;<br />Strike two is the lack of photographs.  So much of this book depends on the items found in the tomb of the mystery woman, yet nowhere are we shown what they look like.  Whether this is the fault of the author, the editor, or the publisher is unknown, but it rankles, regardless of where the blame lies.<br />Strike three: the conclusion that the mystery woman was a &quot;gladiatrix&quot; is almost ludicrous.  The evidence does not even rise to the level of probable cause; it's a scintilla at most.  There was an object depicting a gladiator in her tomb.  There were lots of other things in the tomb.  Ergo, a gladiator!  Balderdash.  (And how convenient that the pelvic bones have been &quot;lost,&quot; preventing an accurate, independent analysis of the body's gender.  No, I don't blame the author, but it seems like somebody's trying to make a quick buck at the expense of an unsuspecting public.)<br />Three strikes, it's out.	2004-03-15

An old friend of Qui-Gon's is being stalked by a vicious bounty hunter, and our Jedi heroes find themselves outmatched and outwitted at nearly every turn.  After a climactic battle in the snow, The Deadly Hunter ends on a cliff-hanger to rival any that has come before.<br />As usual, Watson is at her best in showing the dynamic between Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan.

In almost every respects, it could serve as the basis for an A&amp;E or History Channel documentary; it outlines the basic facts, presents a scandal or two, but does nothing to engage the mind or reveal deep truths about the human condition.  This book is neither insightful nor provocative, like Christian Meier's Caesar.  Nor does Everitt adequately explain why Cicero held such a fascination for generations to come, including (if not especially) our own founding fathers, John Adams in particular.  And for a biography about a man best remembered for his writings, precious little space is spent discussing Cicero's written ideas.  One gets more of a sense of Cicero as a person from Colleen McCullough's fictional Masters of Rome series.<br />That's the negative.  The positive is that Everitt's account is well-presented and the events surrounding Cicero's life are inherently interesting.  Everitt particularly shines in depicting Cicero's activities after Caesar's assassination, arguing that for the few short months left to his life Cicero was the preeminent man of the hour - mainly because he was the last one of the elder generation left standing.<br />The bottom line is that Everitt's Cicero is a book that nobody should regret reading.  It's a fine review of the end of the Roman Republic, and a good refresher course for those who maybe haven't visited Ancient Rome in a while.  Those looking for some substance, however, and those who are serious Roman scholars, will be disappointed.	2004-03-10

The rest is a chronicle of events in western Europe and the Near East, culminating in the Greek counter-offensive against Persia following the battle of Salamis.  The narrative is full of digressions and tangents to delight all but the most meticulous readers, and Herodotus occasionally apologizes to them for the constant diversions. <br />Herodotus gives a remarkably well balanced account of events, recognizing the motivations and merits of all but a few Greek cities who sided with Persia (Thebes, for example, does not fare well under Herodotus' stylus).  True, he takes some digs at Sparta for being obsessed with festivals, but in the event Sparta's bravery is praised no less than Athens'.  Herodotus was writing as the Peloponnesian War was breaking out, and his declaration that Athens and Sparta together are unbeatable is poignant in light of Greece's impending loss of freedom, a freedom that would not be restored for over two thousand years.<br />Ultimately, The Histories is that best of classics, one that can be enjoyed by all, not just those with an interest in Ancient Greece.  With all of the digressions, there is truly something in here for everyone.	2004-03-06

Against that backdrop, Stackpole places characters we instantly like, and a plot with enough twists and turns to satisfy the most demanding readers.<br />Stackpole is best known for his incredible Star Wars X-wing novels.

Tragically, if this were a &quot;Shadwell Rafferty&quot; book, it wouldn't be all that bad.  Rafferty is an interesting enough fellow, and the narrative voice used for him is light, but gets the job done.

The Coming of the Third Reich is the first in a projected three-volume work intended to explore the Third Reich.  Volume One takes us up as far as the summer of 1933.<br />The use of the term \\"Third Reich\\" in the title is intentional.  While there is, inevitably, a focus on the Nazi party, Evans branches out to cover as many other aspects of German society as he can, with particular attention to the other political movements contemporary with the Nazis.  The result is a broad picture of a Germany searching for its identity, struggling with revolution, economic depression, international humiliation, and political violence.  Evans reveals that every element of the Nazi agenda was present, even if only in the fringes, in German society before World War One, and masterfully shows how both nationalism and anti-semitism grew in virulence and scope as the Weimar Republic decayed.<br />Where Evans particulary shines is in his account of how rapidly and efficiently the Nazis consolidated their power once Hitler was appointed Chancellor in January, 1933.  The pace with which the Nazis destroyed all political rivals is dizzying; it was a blitzkrieg of all potential opposition, with violence and intimidation at its root.<br />If there is a complaint to be had, it is with Evans' (perhaps unconscious) lack of honesty about his viewpoint.  Evans declares in his prologue that it is \\"inappropriate for a work of history to indulge in the luxury of moral judgment.  For one thing, it is unhistorical; for another it is arrogant and presumptuous.\\"  Yet the book is full of moral judgments, if not of the German people as a whole, then of the Nazis themselves.  Near the end, for example, Evans talks about the \\"poison\\" of Nazism.  Do not mistake me - I agree with Evans moral judgment of the Nazis.  I simply take exception to his declaration that he will not make such a judgment.  Personal judgments are entirely appropriate in history, especially in history intended for mass consumption, so long as the historian is honest about his perspective and does not allow his personal views cloud the presentation of facts.<br />Yet that is a relatively minor complaint of an otherwise outstanding work.  Those who have read Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich will find Evans' work less personal, yet more comprehensive.  Indeed, the two books in many ways compliment each other, as Evans himself intended.	2004-02-09

It is the mark of great hubris to give 2 stars to a book that has survived over 2000 years and been a favorite work of many of history's top thinkers and achievers.  Pliny's good enough for Petrarch, but not good enough for jrmspnc, eh?<br />That's not what the star rating is about at all.  Rather, 2 stars reflects my own, entirely subjective impression of the work.  Is this a book that I want to pick up and read for fun?  No.  Is this a book that scholars of the ancient world should read?  I don't know, I'll leave that to the scholars.<br />What we have here is, to a modern reader, more of a Guiness Book of Records than an encyclopedia, although it is clear why Pliny may justly be called the first encyclopedist.  There are some &quot;tall tales&quot; here, reports of creatures with no heads, or backward feet, of people who never laugh, and of people who live to be hundreds of years old.  And there's lessons in mineralogy, botany, zoology, and so on.<br />In short, the book is exactly as advertised.  It is also, to one who looks for skilled prose and historical narrative, fairly tedious.  The nuggest that fire the imagination are few and far between.  Again, exactly as advertised so I have noone to blame but myself.  I just don't see the average lay reader, with a passing interest in things Roman, getting a whole lot out of this one.  Better to read an actual history of Rome, and let the historian cull the good bits out of Pliny.<br />Healy's introduction does not help matters.  Healy spends most of his introduction reciting how completely inaccurate Pliny is, sometimes even by contemporary standards, which does not bode well!  So, the reader finds himself constantly thinking, &quot;well, this is wrong anyway, so what's the point?&quot;<br />The point, of course, is up to each reader to judge.  For this reader, there was very little point at all.	2004-02-08

The majority of the one-star reviews resort to insulting those who have enjoyed the book.  Criticism that consists of name-calling is a high form of praise.<br />Which is not to say that a little bit of controversy surrounding Ender's Game isn't inappropriate.  A six year old child is taken from his family and trained for battle with other children and ultimately commits genocide - xenocide, to be more accurate.  Not a happy, uplifting tale by any stretch of the imagination.  Yet there is something nevertheless compelling in the tale of how Ender overcomes every obstacle placed in his path to not only succeed but, ultimately, grow into a better person than most.  Card's prose is at times spartan, but the pages turn so fast one doesn't notice.<br />Be warned that the &quot;sequel,&quot; Speaker for the Dead, is not really a sequel at all.  It would be difficult to find two more different books marketed as the same series.  Ender returns, but where Ender's Game is largely action-driven, Speaker for the Dead dwells upon inner turmoil and family struggles.  Speaker is by far the more powerful and provocative book, and one does not need to read Ender's Game to appreciate it.	2004-01-29

Imagine A New Hope told in the form of \\"personal logs\\" from Star Trek and you'll have the idea.  John Peel draws on such diverse materials as the radio show and the old Marvel comics to flesh out Luke's story, and takes some minor liberties with the movie itself.  When all is said and done, we are presented with a Luke who must all at once deal with painful loss and grow up more quickly than anyone should have to.

Out of over a hundred fiction reviews, this is only the third book to ever receive five stars.<br />Why does this one merit five stars?  Intricate plotting, fully developed characters, an interesting back-stroy, and prose that perfectly balances description, action, and dialogue.  A Game of Thrones is, in many respects, a retelling of the War of Roses, and owes a great deal of its greatness to Frank Herbert's Dune and even Le Morte d'Arthur.  It is a tale of a once heroic king in decline, of a noble family's treacherous rise to power, and another family's attempt to maintain honor and dignity in an increasingly corrupt world.  There is, to be sure, a minimal amount of traditional \\"fantasy\\" elements, although there are both dragons and un-dead wights enough to satisfy most fantasy fans.  Those who enjoy hefty historical tomes like Shogun will adore this one as much as those who worship Tolkien.<br />If there is any bothersome flaw, it is that the perspective changes with each chapter, and each chapter is emblazoned with the name of the character featured in it.  Some may find this change in perspective irritating, but I found it refreshing. 800 pages of the same viewpoint would be too much.  Nor is Martin a Harry Turtledove, who stays with a character for four pages, not to return for another 50.  Readers should also be warned that the violence and sex is graphic at times, but less so than most Hollywood movies or romance novels.<br />All in all, this one is a keeper.  The negative reviews have me scratching my head.  I have seldom read a book that fires the imagination as much as this one has.  Recommended without reservations.	2004-01-15

I have never been disappointed.  Every recipe I've tried from it has been relatively easy to make and incredibly, incredibly delicious.  Be warned, there's nothing quick in this book - if you're a slow cook like me, plan on a couple of hours for a main course - but the results are very worth it.  We particularly enjoy the Vienna pork rolls (not sure how a recipe named after an Austrian city is Polish, but who am I to question?) and &quot;carrots in sauce.&quot;	2004-01-03

The plot, however, remains fairly typical with a foundling prince who is returned to the world stage by a series of mysterious, powerful mentors.  Along the way, as all recent fantasy heroes do (see, e.g., Jordan's Rand al'Thor or Deborah Chester's Dain), he throws temper tantrums, engages in self-destructive behavior, and does a lot of whining and moping.  Sadly, standard fare in modern fantasy novels.<br />Still, I greatly enjoyed reading Prince of Shadows.  I began reading it reluctantly but quickly found myself drawn in.  Once picked up, it is difficult to put down and one can't help but root for a happy ending.  Of course, there is no ending as it is currently against the law to tell a fantasy story in anything less than three books.  Since this series is called &quot;Seven Brothers&quot; it's fair to assume that readers will have to slog through seven volumes to learn whether hero Llesho prevails in the end.	2004-01-01

That is not because it is a *bad* book; it is, in fact, quite good.  However, it lacks the direction and focus of the other books of the series.<br />Fortune's Favorites begins with Sulla's return to Italy from the East, and ends with Pompey's and Crassus' first &quot;retirement&quot; in 69 B.C.  In between, we're presented with Sulla's dictatorship and debauched death, Sertorius' guerrilla warfare in Spain, the Spartacus revolt, and lots of minor incidents too many to mention.  The focus constantly jumps around from Sulla, to Pompey, Caesar, Cicero, Spartacus, and a dozen lesser lights.<br />As usual, McCullough gives us her own spins on history, spins that are entirely her own yet pleasingly plausible.  Here, McCullough takes advantage of the lack of information about Caesar's early career to team him up with Crassus years before the Cataline conspiracy.  She has Crassus select Caesar as an aid against Spartacus - and why wouldn't Caesar have been involved in the putting down of the revolt?  From Caesar's association with Crassus comes his role as go-between between Crassus and Pompey.  Again, we know historically that Crassus and Pompey, bitter rivals, reached a rapprochement in 70 B.C. - why wouldn't have been Caesar who arranged it?  A simple, yet brilliant conceit that beautifully sets the stage for the First Triumvirate.<br />Those who are on the fence about reading this one, be warned that at times McCullough tries to write a history book.  There are endless pages of Sulla expostulating about his reforms, and still more endless pages about efforts to destroy them.  The prose is, as always, dry and uninspired.  But the overall concept is brilliant, and McCullough beautifully fleshes out Caesar's youth, Pompey's rise, and the rapidly growing decay of the Senate.  Those who enjoyed the first two books in the series should absolutely continue on.	2003-12-27

The Diamond Throne spins a tale of an occasionally sarcastic Church knight who must protect both his Order and his Queen from evil plots.  The story moves across a continent which, fortunately, does not contain the mock-antiquity cultures we saw in the Belgariad.  This is pretty much straight up Middle-Ages land, fleshed out just enough to keep the plot moving.<br />As with the Belgariad, there is nothing original here - a rehash of other fantasy stories.  Eddings' style requires some forgiveness by older readers.  It seems like every time the main character speaks, Eddings rolls a die to see which other character gets to say, &quot;Well spoken, Sparhawk!&quot;  Eddings also expects the reader to instantly have tremendous affection for each of the heroes, but his forced banter between them doesn't cut it.  Arguably the biggest shortfall is the lack of true depth.  The world of The Elenium is dominated by a Church whose theology is only vaguely discussed.  What an opportunity to explore issues of spirituality, piety in an organized religion, devotion and hypocrisy - an opportunity completely wasted.<br />But then one has to expect that from David Eddings.  His books are always Fantasy Lite.  There's no effort to explore deep issues, thus avoiding the pretentiousness of a Robert Jordan.  There's no melodrama, either.  The Diamond Throne is light entertainment, a fun read that taxes the brain cells not at all.  It's rather like watching television, only without the commercials.	2003-12-14

The stories themselves, however, seldom rise above the ordinary.  Holmesophiles will no doubt tremendously appreciate the chronology and annotated bibliography assembled by editor Mike Ashley, although they may also chuckle at Ashley's tendency to say &quot;I know Watson says this case happened in 1897, but I think he was lying and it really happened in 1895.&quot;<br />Apart from Ashley's chronology and bibliography there isn't much memorable here.  The stories are all adequate but lack the spark that make the original Doyle adventures special.  All are stories even the casual Holmes fan won't mind reading, but none will compel the reader to revisit them.	2003-12-07

Barring catastrophe (or blowing himself up on a Romulan warbird), Data will outlive all those close to him, a prospect the emotion-chipped Data worries over.  Such is the theme that should pervade the book, but all it receives is the occasional lip-service.<br />Instead, we are given a plot that ties in threads from several TOS episodes, including the infamous Roger Korby.  There is even a cameo by &quot;Norman&quot; of Harcourt Fenton Mudd fame.  The attempt to draw all the TOS androids into the TNG &quot;Data Is Unique&quot; universe is well-done and should be satisfying to all Trek fans.  Non Trek fans, however, will probably be left cold (but then why would a non-Trek fan be reading this, anyway?).<br />Perhaps the biggest plus to Immortal Coil is a chance to see Data struggling with his emotions and identity, something we only get to see in First Contact (Immortal Coil takes place sometime after First Contact).  That alone makes this one worth the time of any Trek fan, but there's nothing here to appeal to the general public.  Ultimately, it's standard Trek fare.	2003-11-29

I've read BLTs over a half dozen times and have nearly hurt myself from laughing each time.  I've shared it with friends who have threatened to sue, they were in so much pain from laughing.  This is intellectual humor, too, by the way - it appeals to those with minds (which does not include the character \\"Pig\\").  No \\"Cathy\\" fat jokes or \\"Garfield\\" lasagna riffs here, folks.  Of course, the warmth of Calvin and Hobbes is missing, and although there are some similarities between Pig and the equally hapless (although smarter) Opus, you won't want to give Pig a huge hug the way you would Opus (and the heck with herring breath!)	2003-11-20

Reading the reviews of the Scarlet Pimpernel, one expects Erol Flynn in print, with clever banter exchanged during swordfights, daring escapes, diabolical plotting by the villains.  In the event, we get maybe one out of three.  <br />It's not that the novel is terribly written; there are some comlaints to be had there, but ultimately the book is too short for the complaints to matter.  In fact, the novel starts out beautifully, with a French official bragging about how the Scarlet Pimpernel will never get past *him*, only to be duped himself.  But after that first chapter it's Dullsville, with only an occasional spark of excitement.  It's hard to get excited about a rich nobleman saving other rich noblemen, for one thing.  For another, the gallant adventure promised is simply missing completely.  If you want daring and dashing adventure, read The Three Musketeers - it's incredibly long, but you'll get much more satisfaction per page than you will here.	2003-11-16

It would take multiple readings to truly know for sure.  On its surface, Arrive is about the creation of a supercomputer, with self-awareness and tasked with three problems:  find true leadership, find true love, and find the true shape of the universe.  The narrative style is reminiscent of Russia's Olesha, or perhaps a William Faulkner with talent.  One can never be sure if the events being related are &quot;real&quot; or are merely metaphor.  The machine itself, Epikt, drives this home somewhat early on.  Just when the reader is about to throw the book down in disgust over characters becoming &quot;tigers&quot; and eating &quot;goats&quot;, Epikt declares, &quot;You know, don't you, that there aren't *really* tigers, this is just a metaphor that perhaps has gone on too long&quot; (my paraphrase).  This blurring between &quot;real&quot; and metaphor, with lots of unique turns of phrase, make Arrive at Easterwine a challenging read, which not everyone will have the energy to get through.  And, I can't say that it is worth the effort.  It may very well be - I'm still scratching my head about it three days after I finished - but only repeat readings will truly tell the tale.	2003-11-10

True, there's lip service paid to mystery here, as Gordianus is asked to find out the truth behind a missing woman, but the mystery is secondary - even tertiary - Gordianus' own relationship with his son Meto and the fate of a city under siege by Julius Caesar's forces.<br />As historical fiction, Last Seen in Massilia is a worthy successor to Rubicon and all the Gordianus books that came before it.  Saylor's prose has become simpler over the years, and Last Seen in Massilia can be read almost as quickly as a Robert B. Parker novel, with every bit as much pleasure.  Saylor has taken the siege of Massilia, a footnote in Caesar's career, and made it the backdrop of a gripping tale of intrigue and relationships gone sour.<br />Fans of Saylor will not be disappointed, and those reading Saylor for the first time will be pleased.  One truly does not have to have read the preceeding books to enjoy this one.	2003-11-10

The Grass Crown, second in the series, stands up to repeat readings better than The First Man in Rome does, and contains some truly wonderful conceits that bring the fall of the Roman Republic to life in a way no other writer has done.<br />The Grass Crown takes us from shortly after the end of the German wars to the death of Gaius Marius, a period of about twelve years.  We see Marius' descent into madness (and repeat readings show that Marius' fall is, in fact, very well plotted), and Sulla's rise to power and cold-blooded tyranny.  We also meet the &quot;next generation&quot; - Cicero, Cato, Pompey, and Julius Caesar himself, who is too prodigious to be accepted.  Cicero and Pompey, however, are fully fleshed out youths; McCullough's Cicero (here and in succeeding books) is extremely convincing.  The hero of The Grass Crown, however, and the most compelling character, is Marcus Livius Drusus (Cato's uncle and great-uncle of Brutus), who evolved nicely from the stuck-up arrogant snob we met at the beginning of The First Man in Rome.  His efforts to prevent the Social War are moving and well-depicted.<br />As for McCullough's conceits, the best is the idea that Marius made Caesar flamen dialis, a priest, to *punish* him, to prevent Caesar from eclipsing him.  Most historians cite Caesar's flaminate as a mark of honor and prestige; McCullough skilfully turns that notion on its head.  <br />The Grass Crown is not, alas, perfect.  It suffers from McCullough's often clunky prose, for one thing.  For another, the whole series desperately needs a character guide to help the reader keep track of who is whom, and who is to become the parent or relative of which famous Roman.  The huge cast of characters may be daunting for those with no knowledge of Roman history, but for the rest of us The Grass Crown is very much worth multiple reads.	2003-11-05

Sarah Singleton's &quot;Ebb Tide&quot; is also moving, although its story of mermaid love has been done many times before.  The contributions of the heavyweights, George R.R.

It is hardly as good as most of its predecessors, suffering from a mostly predictable story, and, in fact, a story that feels like one we've read a dozen (or at least nine) times before.  And what there is of a plot is seriously flawed.  Rutan and Senali have been exchanging crown princes for generations, we're told, yet the reigning rulers behave as if each has never left his planet!  Perhaps a ten year old will not be troubled by this giant oversight, but this thirty three year old couldn't get past it.<br />It would be impossible to reach a constant level of excellence over ten books, so the relative mediocrity of The Shattered Peace should not dissuade one from continuing on with the series.	2003-10-11

McCullough takes us back to a time in the late Republic not often visited by fiction writers, to the dawn of Marius' and Sulla's careers, two powerful men who fought the first of the many civil wars that were to plague Rome for centuries to come.  McCullough's characterizations are memorable, her grasp of detail impressive, and her conceit that Marius and Sulla were brothers-in-law is astounding.  As McCullough herself admits, there is no evidence to support her idea (beyond one reference to Sulla's first wife being a &quot;Julia&quot;), but once the seed has been planted it's impossible to think it could have been otherwise.<br />The cast of characters is huge, and it is often difficult to keep track of the dozens of secondary characters that come and go.  Because of that, this is a book that benefits from multiple readings.  One can hold out hope, however, that future editions will come with a character guide.  It would be nice to know in advance, for example, that the son of the Lucullus who goes to Sicily is *that* Lucullus who fought Mithridates in the 70s, and that Pompeius Strabo is the father of Pompey the Great.  A character guide would also help keep the endless arrays Lucii, Caesari, Metelli, and Cotti straight.<br />McCullough is a master of intricate plots, but does suffer from failings.  While McCullough's major characters (such as Marius with his eyebrows and Scaurus with his bald head) are memorable, none of the characters in the series seem *real*, except for Cicero in later books.  McCullough's prose is often obtuse, lacking rhythym and occasionally jarring the reader out of the story.  Steven Saylor, writing about a slightly later period, is a better writer.  However, there is still so much to enjoy and treasure here that one will easily forget that the prose ain't pretty.	2003-10-08

Parker has to rank high among the demigods of Entertainment Fiction.  95% of his works are brilliant brain candy - so much fun to read that they can't be put down, and are read in a couple of hours (thus supporting Poe's claim that a work that can't be read in one sitting isn't worth reading).  When you pick up a Parker book, that's all you have a right to expect.  There will be no deep characterizations, no exploration of themes that stand the cold light of scrutiny, no meaningful insights into the human condition.  Even the plots usually won't withstand much analysis.  Oh, sure, Parker likes to pretend he's giving us all that, but we know, and he knows, that it's just a sham.  All a Parker book is about is sharp dialogue and crack witticisms.<br />And that's exactly what we get with Shrink Rap.  As a novel, it is extremely flawed.  As entertainment, it is incredible.  Perhaps most entertaining of all is Sunny Randall herself.  True, she often seems like Spenser in petticoats - the same wisecracking wit, the same moral code.  Yet Sunny is more compelling than Spenser.  Not only is she more introspective than Spenser (we find out about Spenser's inner psyche only by other people - Susan, mainly - talking about him as if he weren't there; we're given a direct link to Sunny's feelings), but she's better than Spenser because she cannot fall back on brawn to get her through situations.  Spenser ticks people off because he knows he can beat the snot out of them if he has to.  Sunny, like the vast majority of us, does not have that option.  Which, all told, makes her more real than Spenser and in some ways more enjoyable.<br />All the complaints about Shrink Rap are fair, but misguided.  A Parker book is meant to be read quickly, enjoyed, and then put on the shelf for a slow afternoon at the beach.

The real life stories of courage and audacity presented here are powerful, gripping, and occasionally even moving.  No matter how many times you may have seen The Hunt for Red October you won't be prepared for the reality of life under the sea in enemy territory.  The book loses some of its heroic qualities as it enters the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton eras, as it leaves personal stories behind for a &quot;bigger picture&quot; view of struggles between the admninstrations and Congress and summits between Reagan and Gorbachev.  However, it never loses its sense of awe and wonder at what Americans accomplished through hard work, quality training, and some of that good old-fashioned &quot;American know-how.&quot;  (We also get some glimpses of what the Soviet counterparts had to endure; similar dangers from the deep with additonal dangers from their own equipment.)  This is easily the most intriguing modern history book I've read since Jim Lovell's Lost Moon.  No reader will be disappointed.	2003-09-28

Volume seven continues the tale of a city in decay, this time, mercifully, with an index of characters.  Most of the usual suspects contribute here, including Asprin, Abbey, C.J. Cherryh, Andrew Offut, Diana Paxson, Janet Morris, and Diane Duane.  Duane's story is the highlight, as she sends three characters and a dog on journey to Hell.  Duane provides a wonderful example of what the Russians call &quot;ostranyenye&quot; or &quot;estrangement&quot;, as she gives us the dog's perspective on life, death, and society in general.<br />There is a world of difference between book seven and book one.  One can read book one and think, as I did, that it's not a big deal, just a few loosely connected stories.  The first book is just the prologue, however, and watching the characters, series, and, above all, Sanctuary, evolve is a disturbing delight.  Disturbing because Sanctuary is not a nice place, and the people with very few exceptions are not nice people, but a delight because several talented authors are playing off each other, inspired by each other, and ultimately fusing their several parts into an intriguing whole.  The series continues to be worth the price of admission.	2003-09-22

Kirk, Spock, and McCoy meet a Starfleet secret agent.  Kirk, Spock, and the agent fall madly, deeply, passionately in love - in less than five minutes.  And, my friends, this is a love without boundaries, destined for each from years back.  The agent was fated for Kirk, but Spock needs a lover to survive pon farr, but Spock is conflicted because she's Kirk's woman, but Kirk is willing to sacrifice her for Spock, and oh my God it just goes on and on like that, enough to nauseate even those with the strongest stomachs.  And keep in mind that this one takes place shortly after V-ger; so the reader is stuck with a mental image of Bad Hair Kirk playing the seducer.  Yuck and double yuck.<br />As if that wasn't enough, we are forced to deal with the same hyperbolic descriptions of Kirk and Spock we got in the authors' Phoenix series.  Spock is the Supreme Vulcan Male, you see, and while Kirk is Supreme Human Male, he must still be tenderly protected by Spock from the Big Bad Universe.  This melodrama was, somehow, tolerable in the Phoenix novels.  After less than a hundred pages of this one, though, my eyeballs hurt so much from all the rolling that I had to take an Advil.<br />You'll notice I haven't even tried to talk about the primary plot involving pathetic &quot;one-minders.&quot;<br />Avoid this one at all costs.  If you want a Trek love Triangle, stick to Peter David's Imzadi II.	2003-09-21
US	44207108	R2DPLXEFM6K7Z5	0312187459	237942375	The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel	Books	3	4	7	N	N	One-part incredible, two parts dull	The Memoirs of Cleopatra is a very good book.  Alas, you don't discover that until after you've slogged through 700 pages of really dull, often eye-rolling, bland prose.  The last 250 pages, however, are powerful, gripping, and moving.<br />Is it worth the 700 pages of tedium to get to the last 250?  In the end, yes.  Margaret George has given us an amazing depiction of Marc Antony - multi-faceted, both strong and weak, confident and cowardly.  Fans of both Roman history and literature in general will find much to admire about George's ability to bring Antony to life.  The Octavian seen here is intriguing, if one-dimensional; Octavian as he probably must have been to have gained absolute power, but a far cry from the benevolent Augustus we tend to picture.  As events race to conclusion at Actium and afterwords, George will leave you gasping for breath, trying to keep up.<br />The tedium until that point, however, is painful.  The book is simply far too long for a first-person narrative.  A periodic change in perspective is critical to avoid burn-out (see Shogun or War in Peace, which change viewpoints often).  It does not help that Cleopatra's voice is not a strong one, lacking the charm of Robert Graves' Claudius or the strength of Mary Stewart's Merlin, and failing to arouse any strong feelings of either like or hate.  George's Caesar seems flat, as does Cleopatra's instant infatuation with him.  So many times I found myself longing to give up on the book.  I'm glad I did not, but it was a tough struggle.<br />An earlier reviewer suggested reading the end of the book first.  Since we all know how the story ends anyway, that might not be such a bad idea.	2003-09-14
US	44207108	RT805JT5AQK6Q	0271007699	574762228	The Coming of Christianity to Anglo-Saxon England: Third Edition	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Delicious	Reading the Coming of Christianity to Anglo-Saxon England is like going to a dim-sum restaurant.  Mayr-Harting brings out cart after cart delectable goodies, almost all of them enjoyable.  However, there is no menu to provide organization for the cuisine, and you're left wondering just what it was that you ate.<br />What I mean is this.  The book lacks any overall narrative, and the lack leaves those with little familiarity with Anglo-Saxon England feeling a little lost.  Even a timeline as an appendix would have been helpful, showing us when St. Augustine arrived, when the King of East Anglia was converted, etc.<br />In fact, the lack of chronological narrative means that the book is *not* the story of the coming of Christianity to England.  Rather, it is simply about organized Christianity in early England and some of the major ecclesiastical figures involved.  Nevertheless, we are given highly enlightening vignettes of Anglo-Saxon England and the early Church, with brief forays into Ireland, Gaul, Spain, and elsewhere.  We learn of a time when Rome was not the all-powerful center of Catholicism, when the Irish were at the forefront, and British (Roman and Celtic) Christians were fading into the sunset.  Every page, and nearly ever paragraph, provides an interesting tidbit about worship, monasticism, folklore, and almost any subject one would care to think of.<br />Perhaps most satisfying of all is to read about Church figures who truly were &quot;Christian&quot;, genuinely concerned about spreading the Gospel as opposed to accumulating power or triumphing in doctrinal disputes.  A refreshing perspective that those more used to following events in Rome, Constantinople, and Alexandria all too seldom see. <br />This is not a book for those who solely wish to have an overview of the conversion of Anglo-Saxon England.  It is, however, full of delights for the discerning reader.	2003-08-26

As a lay reader, however, I will say that The Secret History does not disappoint, even after having already heard most of the scuttlebut second-hand through Gibbon and Norwich.  Procopius tells us in the beginning that he is writing for us, readers of a distant generation, and the effect of a writer trying to communicate across the centuries is remarkable.  What we hear about Justinian and his wife Theodora is surprising to those who only Justinian through their introductory history classes - the emperor who restored the Eastern Roman Empire to its great glory, codified laws, etc., etc.  But Procopius shows a different side to the Imperial couple, one that should not be surprising at all considering their on-again, off-again relationship with Belisarius. Indeed, the megalomania described by Procopius accords perfectly well with Justinian's war efforts - constant changes of leadership and refusal to recognize anything but his own suzerainty doomed the Byzantine reconquests.<br />The three star rating is not a reflection on Procopius, but, rather, on the packaging.  Procopius tells us that The Secret History should be read as an appendix to his Histories of the wars.  Indeed, his text constantly says, &quot;as I described earlier,&quot; or, more poignantly, &quot;here's what I said before, now let me tell you the *real* story.&quot;  In other words, The Secret History does not stand by itself.  It truly needs to be published together with The Histories.	2003-08-23

Fortunately, Weinstein is nowhere to be found here.  Instead, Jerry Oltien presents us with a tale that is interesting and at times even gripping.  The space whales turn out to be vicious predators, eating machines that would make the aliens of Aliens proud.  When, early on, one literally takes a bite out of the Enterprise, you know you're in for a good time.  The Captain Pike here is not entirely consistent with that seen in The Menagerie, and Peter David did a better job with Pike's crew in The Rift than Oltion manages here.  Nevertheless, Oltion does a creditable job, giving us a book more than worth any Trek reader's time.<br />There are two serious flaws here.  First, the ending is abrupt, pat, and weak.  Typical Star Trek happy ending.  The other is that Oltion is forced to work within the god-awful Captain's Table concept.  Fortunately, he makes our job easy by alternating chapters between the bar and Pike's story, making skipping blessfully easy.<br />The Captain's Table as a whole produced one exceptional book, (Janeway's Fireship), three very good books (Kirk/Sulu, Pike, and Peter David's Calhoun) and two down-right stinkers (Picard and Sisko, sadly).  With the possible exception of the Kirk/Sulu tale, the books that succeed do so in spite of the Captain's Table concept, not because of it.  The concept was a stupid one and the Trek universe is worse off because of it.  Discerning Trek readers should still read the four good books, however; simply skip everything about the bar and enjoy the rare first-person perspectives.	2003-08-23
US	44207108	RNN1M3XFXVG8M	0140088784	876636990	Alexander the Great	Books	3	44	51	N	N	Like a trip through the Makran	Try as I might, I cannot bring myself to give Fox's treatment of Alexander the lavish four and five stars that others have given.  It's not that there aren't some qualities here worthy of praise, it's that there is far too much that detracts from the enjoyment.<br />This is the first biography of Alexander I have read, so I'm in no position to compare it to others out there.  I can say, however, that Fox succeeds marvelously in bringing geography to life.  Despite reading countless books about events in the Middle East, I never truly appreciated how formidable the climate there is until reading Fox.  Fox presents a picture that is literally Alexander against the world - against deserts, mountains, heat, cold, snakes, and disease.  For this alone, Fox's biography of Alexander is worth reading.  I can think of no other historian who so skilfully matches events to geography.<br />Alas, there are some daunting downsides.  While Fox's descriptions of geographic features are amazing, his maps are terrible.  This is not entirely his fault; much of the blame lies with the black-and-white reprint.  But even putting that aside, the maps given do not completely follow the text and are too few and too far spaced through the book to be much use.  Far better to put several maps in one place at the beginning or end of the book for ease of reference.  Too, Fox has a depressing tendency to talk in circles for pages on end, retelling the same event over and over and over with slight variations, then giving his own conclusions that sound an awful lot like the original version of the story presented pages before.  The effect is to make the reader all the more sympathetic with Alexander's soldiers as they marched through the Makran desert; like them, the reader becomes opressed by the thought that the journey will never end, no matter how worthwhile the result will be.	2003-08-12

Sorry, Dullsgorod.  Even Zamyatin's We, so gripping in Mirra Ginsburg's now classic translation, falls flat in this new &quot;accurate&quot; rendition (a cursory review of the original Russian suggests that this We is more word-for-word accurate, but it loses most of the unique flavor that is Zamyatin).  The Civil War tales are poorly represented by Armored-Train 14-69 (rather than Fadeev's The Nineteen).  While Pilnyak and Bulgakov are here, neither are at their best; Bulgakov's &quot;The Fatal Eggs&quot; belongs to an 1950s American sci-fi horror movie - why this one was chosen over The Heart of a Dog (or Pilnyak's moving &quot;Mahogony&quot; over the famous &quot;Tale of the Unextinguished Moon&quot;) is a mystery.<br />There are some good selections here, like &quot;Mahogony&quot;, and a couple short ones from Zoschenko.  But the good ones are not incredible and will leave one thinking that literature in NEP Russia was decadent and dull.<br />It wasn't.  Read Pilnyak's The Naked Year, Ginsburg's translation of We, Olesha's Envy, or even, believe it or not, Gladkov's Cement.  Those are all works worth a discerning reader's time.<br />One final comment.  Robert Maguire's introduction is a good one, but fails to capture the true dynamic between politics and literature that was occuring in the 1920s.  The struggle in the Bolshevik party between &quot;intellectuals&quot; like Trotsky and Lunacharsky and pedestrians like Stalin was mirrored in literature.  Trotsky himself wrote several articles about literature, championing a diversity of forms and claiming that the bourgeois heritage must not be discarded.  He lost, of course, and so did his view on literature.  Maguire unfortunately only brushes the surface of that struggle.	2003-08-02

The Fight for Truth takes the series in a slightly different direction than the immediate predecessors.  Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are on a mission of peace for once, and the action is accordingly minimal.  But Watson's story telling skills are such that we really don't mind.  What should bother more people than it does (both the characters in the novel and we readers) is the Jedis' mission to take a young Force-sensitive child from her parents.  True, the parents \\"want\\" the child to be raised as a Jedi, but why doesn't the Jedi penchant for depriving children of their parents trouble more people?  For a while, there was a web-site run by Lucasfilm called \\"holonetnews\\", which was a mock news-site for events leading up to Attack of the Clones.  There was an on-going \\"story\\" about a woman complaining that the Jedi had kidnapped her baby.  That's a perspective that begs to be explored in a novel, although perhaps the Jedi Apprentice series with its young target audience is not the best place to do so.<br />Yet putting that aside, there's still a great deal to enjoy in The Fight for Truth.  Here we begin to see the thirteen year old Obi-Wan maturing into the young man of The Phantom Menace as Obi-Wan is paired with a Padawan two years younger, and finds himself trying to mentor her.  We also see more of Qui-Gon's headstrong stubborness (Remember Obi-Wan's plea \\"Master, don't defy the Council.  Not again.\\") as he comes into conflict with future Council member Adi Gallia about how to accomplish their mission.  It is these ever-changing, ever-developing aspects of Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan that make every Jedi Apprentice novel such a treat.<br />There are many who complain that the Jedi Apprentice novels are too short.  I disagree.  Edgar Allen Poe used to say that a mark of truly great literature can be read in one sitting.  Each Jedi Apprentice novel more than satisfies that requirement.  It's bite-sized Star Wars and it's delicious.	2003-07-31

Spock and Sulu end up on a world with the technology level somewhere akin to 16th century Japan.  They become embroiled in a coup and end up on the run - think &quot;Friday's Child&quot; with gory sword fights.<br />The plusses here include likeable secondary characters (a rarity in a Trek novel) and . . . well, there's not a lot else that's exceptional.  Shadow Lord is enjoyable and quick, but not much else.<br />There are a couple of huge negatives however, which warrant the two star rating.  The first is not Yep's fault, but it is enormously aggravating.  The cover art.  First, it has Sulu in a blue uniform.  Second, the &quot;shadow lord&quot; is pictured as a late 70s porn star; seeing him, you picture a man full of his own machismo who tries to hit on Uhura.  In reality, however, the &quot;shadow lord&quot; is a large, furry mammal which looks like an otter, with a keen sense of humor.  The second involves the whole backstory.  The shadow lord's world, Angira, wants to learn more about the Federation . . . great, but how did this medieval society learn about the Federation in the first place??  When one is able to put this issue out of mind, Shadow Lord is amusing, but then it comes back and the eyes start to roll.	2003-07-29

The Conquerors Trilogy deserves to be remembered as an all-time great, and The Icarus Hunt was a delightful action/suspense novel that keeps the reader on the edge of the seat.  Angelmass, unfortunately, does not come close to Conquerors or Icarus.  It is better than some of Zahn's middle-period works (like Triplet, for example), but not the five-star we'd been coming to expect.  (And that's okay; we can't expect a writer to be perfect *every* time, can we?)<br />Angelmass is a black hole that spits out &quot;angels.&quot;  What the angels are and how they affect humans is the center point of the novel, and often the science babble overwhelms the story.  Characters here are often too wooden, and sometimes seem to be caricatures of previous Zahn characters (High Senator Forsythe reads like a dumbed-down version of Talon Karrde, for example).  We learn on the last page to our astonishing lack of surprise that the two main characters are becoming romantically involved - a result both blatantly predictable and poorly developed.<br />But then one doesn't read Zahn for character or romance, does one?  Zahn is best at plotting and action, and Angelmass provides both.  Zahn is a master of battle - both space battles and one-on-one combat, and there is enough of each here to please any Zahn fan.  There's political intrigue, too, of course.  In short, Zahn fans will find enough here to enjoy.  Non-Zahn fans, however, may read this one and wonder what all the Zahn fuss is about.	2003-07-22

But Diane Duane put me off; I thought her Romulan Way novel was overblown and she'd turned an amusing idea into garbage in Doctor's Orders.<br />My fears were unfounded however.  True, Duane wrote this one with a dictionary (for example, Geordi uses the word &quot;collimated&quot; in casual conversation), but in between the spelling bee words we have an intense, powerful drama that makes Dark Mirror among the best Trek books ever written.  Picard, Geordi, and Deanna must deal directly with the evil Enterprise while concealing their activities from their counterparts.  Tension is high, emotions are powerful, and the evil Troi is incredibly, powerfully, evil.  There are many moments here worth savoring, including the evil universe's versions of The Merchant of Venice and The Iliad, and Duane's theory of what became of evil Spock.<br />Duane's account of the mirror universe is, to my mind, much more compelling than the &quot;official&quot; take we got in DS9, which seemed to too often fall into parody rather than horror (Kira wanting to seduce herself? Yuck.).  I have not read Shatner's version, so can't compare.  I will say that Dark Mirror is a very powerful read, that rarest of Star Trek books that is an excellent novel in its own right.	2003-07-12

But a love of cats is not enough to get one through this poorly crafted book.  \\"Poorly crafted\\" is precisely what I mean.  The Hausmans appear unable to decide whether they are relating anecdotes, myths, popular culture, vetrinary science or something else altogether.  The narrative tone varies from pedantic to pseudo-scholarly to mind-numblingly pedestrian - sometimes in the same sentence.  There is an appalling lack of structure, as well.  The Hausmans thought it would be cute to section the book into chapters by cat breeds, but are unable to stick to their own plan.  Each chapter itself is supposed to be divided into a \\"lore\\" section and a \\"fact\\" section, but, again, the division is truer in name than reality.  Ultimately, the whole thing reads somewhat like Robert Graves' analysis sections in The Greek Myths without the scholarly impact.  I can think of more succinct summary of the book than \\"lame.\\"	2003-07-08

It is, rather, a typically enjoyable Trek read, interesting and amusing at times but not terribly moving or powerful.<br />Crispin is certainly capable of better.  Yesterday's Son is a well-deserved classic, and her Han Solo trilogy was very well done.  Here, however, she lowered her sights too far.  We get an alien artifact that traps the Enterprise and will eventually drive the crew mad (yet none of the major characters except Troi are affected without actually going on board the artifact.  Apparently, senior officers are exempt from the effects).  And there is a twee sub-plot involving a blind Andorian orphan girl, which is interesting only because it involves the Vulcan Dr. Selar.<br />Where the novel could have excelled is with Geordi LaForge.  Crispin makes token references to LaForge's blindness, and early on it seems there will be a tie-in between Geordi and the Andorian girl, Thala.  When Geordi ends up being the only one on board who can handle the visual impact of the artifact, one thinks there will be still more insight offered.  I don't mean a &quot;blind people are people too&quot; kind of revelation as that would be both cheesy and condescending.  Rather, there could have been a situation where Geordi is truly forced to deal with wearing his VISOR or (as he ultimately did) receiving some kind of neural implant to allow him to &quot;see,&quot; and Thala's own handling of a similar choice would have provided a perfect foil.  Alas, Crispin presents the dilemma in the first dozen pages then largely ignores it.  In the end, it is Data, not Geordi who has the revelation.<br />On a side note, I first read this one over a decade ago and, for some reason, it had left a sour taste.  It ended up being much, much better than I remembered.	2003-07-07

Having finally found one, I decided to re-read August 1914.  I have no idea what I could possibly have liked about it the first time through.<br />Solzhenitsyn tries too desperately to write his own War and Peace and fails miserably.  Where Tolstoy truly breathes life into his characters, Solzhenitsyn creates cardboard cutouts that lack depth and ring false at every turn.  Where Tolstoy kept his historical lectures separate from the narrative, Solzhenitsyn puts his in the mouths of the characters, creating incredibly obtuse dialogues that make one want to throw the book down.  Perhaps realizing that the readers are not likely to releate to the characters, Solzhenitsyn tells how character A (whom we apparently are supposed to like) really likes character B (whom up until now we haven't cared for at all), so now, therefore, we must like him, too.  Characters, like Russian general Samsonov, who might have had some subtle nuances get stamped with \\"good\\" or \\"evil\\", completely destroying any chance for the reader to form his own impressions.  Partly this occurs because Solzhenitsyn, as he did in his earler works, is pursuing his own agenda and is unable or unwilling to provide a dispassioned viewpoint (one need only skim through Lenin in Zurich, originally part of August 1914).<br />Once the Battle of Tannenberg gets underway the situation improves, but it is a long, long painful slog until that point and it is not worth it.<br />Do not misunderstand me; Solzhenitsyn will remain a part of my libary for the Gulag Archipelago and his semi-autobiographical fiction.  But the Red Wheel series will not be rolling in my house anymore.  Rereading August 1914, I kept recalling Vladimir Voinovich's caricature of Solzhenitsyn in Moscow 2042 - a writer utterly convinced he alone can save Russia by riding in on a white horse.That's the Solzhenitsyn we see in August 1914.  Avoid this one.	2003-07-07

Card's weekly reviews and essays show a man with intelligence and perspicacity, and made me look forward greatly to Seventh Son.<br />I was not disappointed.  Seventh Son presents us with an early 19th century America where Oliver Cromwell lived to 97, which kept the Protectorate alive and prevented the Restoration.  The bulk of the action takes place near the Wabash River in our Indiana, and there are plenty of references to William Henry Harrison, Tecumseh, Jefferson, Patrick Henry, et al., and a very moving story of George Washington.  Poet William Blake appears as a major character and Ben Franklin has a cameo.<br />The true heart of the story revolves less around characters than around the relationship between people and God, between Good and Evil, and humanity's ability or lack thereof to distinguish between them.  Organized religion does not fare too well here, so those easily offended by criticisms of Christian churches would do well to avoid this one.  Those open to discussions of spirituality, however, are well-served here.  The characters serve as conduits for said discussion - at times subtly.  We are not hit over the head with it, but it is truly the major theme of the novel.<br />This is not Ender's Game or Speaker for the Dead, however.  There are some flaws, not least of which is that in many ways the novel reads like Ender's Game or Speaker for the Dead transplanted to the American frontier.  There is a similar focus on family dynamics and child prodigy Alvin is a bit too much like Ender (well, let's be honest, he is indistinguishable from Ender).  Card's narrative also slips in and out of dialect, presumably as the point of view shifts between characters but not always consistently, resulting an occasional \\"clunky\\" style as another reviewer has commented.  Neither problem changes the fact that Seventh Son is worth the time of anyone who enjoys intellectually provocativeliterature.	2003-07-07

The novel reads like an *almost* great novel yet ultimately doesn't rise above the average Trek book.  There are two significant issues.  First, Clowes has great difficulty keeping the narrative voice constant.  She changes perspective without warning, to jarring effect.  Perhaps she was deliberately aiming for a third-person omniscient voice rather than limited third-person, but she doesn't succeed.  The other major issue is one that usually doesn't bother me:  Saavik does not seem like Saavik at all.  Try as I might, I could not see either Kirstie Alley or the other one in this Saavik, and it really, really grated.<br />There is some good, though.  The &quot;Saavik&quot; we're presented with is interesting enough, and the story opens with a poignant conflict between Spock and Sarek.  It is difficult to say why this one left me fairly cold when others were greatly moved.  No Trek fan will be wasting his or her time reading it, though.	2003-06-30

Typically Ace, it doesn't quite live up to its hype.  The twenty six stories collected here are not the \\"Best Science Fiction of the Century\\" by anybody's count, even Orson Scott Card's own.  Card himself describes his selection process in the Introduction:  these are stories he loved at the first reading, enjoys on repeat readings, and \\"[a]bove all, these are stories that I cannot forget.\\"<br />I, however, *can* forget several of these stories - and already have, a mere few days after reading them.  Most of the forgettable stories are the more recent ones, which is probably not a coincidence.  Early science fiction (pre-1960s, let's say) is almost inherently more worthwhile than most later science fiction, and the stories selected here are cases in point.  Terry Bisson's \\"Bears Discover Fire\\" is a meandering inanity.  \\"Dog Fight\\" by William Gibson and Michael Swanwick is a drugs and sex tale, \\"appealing\\" only in the way that Trainspotting was \\"appealing.\\"  \\"Rat\\" by James Patrick Kelly is similar.<br />There are, however, some truly, truly great stories here, which more than merit four stars.  \\"The Tunnel Under the World\\" by Frederick Pohl, for example, ends with a revelation worth the price of admission.  \\"Inconstant Moon\\" by Larry Niven is full of emotional impact as two individuals adjust to the thought of the sun going nova.  George R. R. Martin's \\"Sandkings\\", despite being relatively recent, is a story that would might expect from Stephen King at the top of his game.  Heinlein's \\"All You Zombies-\\" is a time-travel story to make the head spin.  James Blish's \\"A Work of Art\\" puts Richard Strauss into the 22d century.  Perhaps the most enjoyable of all is \\"Tunesmith\\" by Lloyd Biggle, Jr.  Biggle, writing in 1957, the dawn of the television age, predicts a society where commercials have subsumed all other forms of art, until a gifted musician appears to save society.  A surprisingly moving story, and finely crafted, skilfully bringing the reader full circle without the reader ever suspecting that he was moving.<br />...if you truly want \\"masterpieces,\\" you should pick up Silverberg's Science Fiction Hall of Fame, volume one, or even the Best of the Nebulas edited by Ben Bova.  But if you want several excellent stories by talented writers, you would do much worse than this collection of Card's favorites.	2003-06-27

This is, however, her fifth and so flaws that would be acceptable in a novice become more glaring.<br />What do I mean?  Czerneda's preface declares that writing third person is difficult; I suspect she talked herself into making it more difficult than it really is and ends up goofing.  For example, there is ample italicized inner monologue, a device most often used to allow a third-person narrative to slip into first-person mode; Czerneda, for some reason, maintains the third-person perspective which is jarring.  If there is to be no change in narrative voice, why the change in font?<br />There are other problems.  The heroine, Dr. Gail \\"several middle names\\" Smith, is a top professor at a major university, commanding dozens of top scientists and with a budget that must be in the trillions.  While her age, wisely, is never specified, she is never described as progidy, so she must be at least in her mid-30s - young enough to still be so attractive to every male character in the book, old enough to have reached her position.  Yet she falls for a twenty-year old man, and engages in sexual banter with another twenty-year old.  Cradle robber?  Her personality is also at odds with her position; while our initial impression is of a tough, no-nonsense type, turns out she's weepy-eyed, indecisive, and maudlin.  The same is true to a lesser extent of the hero, Aaron Pardell.  All of which makes for an at times aggravating read.<br />Yet there is much good in In the Company of Others.  The concept of space stations cut off from Earth with a population fighting off despair is an interesting one that Czerneda pulls off well, and the background story of how humanity got that way is fascinating.  The alien Quill end up being satisfying as well, different than the usual bug-eyed aliens and also not a diatribe about human contamination.<br />If this were a first effort, I would be thrilled by the rich imagination and be looking forward to when Czerneda hits her stride.  This is book five, however, and the stride should have been struck by now.  I'm not sure if there was enough about In the Company of Others to warrant seeking out the author's other books; In the Company of Others itself will probably warrant another read down the line.	2003-05-19

The highlight of the novel, however, is Kirk's struggle with his own libido as he finds himself trying to charm a woman he dislikes solely because she's a &quot;hottie.&quot;<br />Otherwise, The Starship Trap is typical Trek.  There is a brief moment, when the Enterprise finds herself trapped in a universe with different physical laws than our own, for some real science to inject itself, but that opportunity is squandered as Spock solves all problems off-camera.  What remains is the usual mindless, harmless entertainment.	2003-05-09

I devoured Dark Is the Sun when I was in junior high, and read the Riverworld series a half dozen times in high school.  As an adult, I was amused by A Barnstormer in Oz.  So, when I saw Riverworld and Other Stories at a book fair I picked it up, figuring the price (25 cents) was right.<br />Let's start with the non-Riverworld stories first.  Several of them are . . . well, there's no other word for it besides obscene.  Farmer himself tells us that one of the stories would only published by a hard-porn magazine, and one can see why.  These stories must be what the Supreme Court means when they mention \\"the prurient interest.\\"  They're not erotic, just vulgar.  And yet, as literary exercises they contain a certain amount of morbid fascination.  \\"The Leaser of Two Evils\\" and \\"The Henry Miller Dawn Patrol\\" in particular show Farmer's remarkable ability to lose himself in a character's dementia.  But is the cleverness worth the obscenity?  One can't help but think that such pieces as \\"J.C. on the Dude Ranch\\" (I'd describe it, but I can't) are better left in Farmer's desk drawer never to see the light of day.<br />There are some pedestrian stories, too, including the amusing but uninspiring \\"The Problem of the Sore Bridge\\" which almost features a Sherlock Holmes cameo.  It's the image of Henry Miller on the prowl in a nursing home that lingers in the memory, though, not the pedestrian stories.<br />As for \\"Riverworld\\" itself, the story is not, as the packaging suggests, the first Riverworld story Farmer wrote.  His own introduction makes it clear that he wrote the stories that became \\"To Your Scattered Bodies Go\\" first.  Nevertheless, \\"Riverworld\\" is an appropriate foray into the Riverworld.  Tom Mix, a character I never cared for in the novels, is much more appealing here. Most provocative, however, is Farmer's take on Jesus - who finds himself resurrected along the river bank with everyone else.  Farmer's \\"Yeshua\\" is a pacifist in the face of senseless violence, a man struggling to maintain serenity when his life's belief has turned out to, perhaps, be false.  There was a reference Jesus in Gods of Riverworld; this story fleshes it out.  To my surprise, part of me was offended by Farmer's take on Jesus; yet Yeshua should serve to spark healthy discussion over the nature of Jesus, what he really stood for, and what he would make of the way his teachings have been passed down by Paul and two thousand years.  Such spiritual examinations are, in my view, nearly always healthy.<br />\\"Riverworld\\" alone makes this collection worth getting and keeping.  As for the other stories . . . . I really don't know.  Perhaps if one knows going in that one is going to get X-rated material it would be easier to digest.  Perhaps not.  Either way, except for \\"Riverworld\\", none of these are stories that one would ever want to read a second time.e river bank with everyone else.

Four stars ultimately prevails because it seems to me that just about any book about the Civil War is almost by definition worth reading, and there is much in With My Face to the Enemy that will please both Civil War aficionados and those with but a passing interest.  Of particular moment are two articles about the Confederate pirate ships (and let's be honest, they *were* pirate ships sans the physical violence) Alabama and Shenandoah, which reveal the genuinely global reach of the conflict.  Every article has something to recommend it, even if, like Stephen Sears' essay on Chancellorsville, you've read it all before.<br />But there are some flaws, too.  Most glaring and annoying is the lack of an index.  Is there any Civil War student who does not rush to the index first to find references to his (or her) favorite general or battle?  No such luck here; you'll have to read the entire book for those brief references to Howard, Hancock, McPherson, et al.  Second, the articles lack two of the major selling points of military history magazines - color maps and illustrations.  Now, I'm a big boy and I don't *need* pictures with my text, but often the art that accompanies an MHQ article is more powerful than the text.  Third, there is a fault that lies with far too many Civil War pieces: biographies of important figures devolving into hagiographies.  For too many Civil War biographers their subject can do, and did no, wrong.  Crowley himself uses the word &quot;hagiography&quot; in one of his introductions.  Whether it's Stonewall or Lee, or Admiral Porter or Sheridan, the lavish praise becomes tiring.  And the final gripe to be made is toward Crowley's introductions, which borrow too liberally from the essays, adding nothing yet stealing the thunder of the contributors.  (The same complaint can be made of Crowley's introductions to the What If? series.)<br />These are not much more than petty gripes, however.  The Civil War remains a fascinating topic, and With My Face to the Enemy provides a wide range of essays covering many areas of the war.  The collection deserves a spot on the bookshelf.	2003-05-02

On the one hand, Davis crafts a better mystery, with excellent attention paid to dropping just the right amount of clues at just the right time, keeping us guessing til the very end as to who is to blame for what.  On the other hand, Saylor is far, far more effective in evoking ancient Rome.  Davis' Falco, to quote a previous reviewer, is &quot;a modern mystery in togas.&quot;  Ancient Rome is the backdrop, but it could just as easily be ancient Greece, or medieval France, or Victorian England.  So, which is better: Saylor or Davis?  That depends on your tastes, obviously.  For the mystery, go to Davis.  For the history, go to Saylor.  Or, better still, read both!<br />This was my first foray into the Falco series, and I did not feel any loss from missing the first two volumes.  Almost the opposite, in fact.  These books are very difficult to find nowadays, so do not wait until you find book one to get started.	2003-04-21

Hernandez-Brun) are unreadable.  Most of the remaining eighteen are provocative, enjoyable, amusing, moving, or all of the above - a remarkably high success rate for any anthology.<br />Some particular standouts:<br />\\"The Translator\\" by Kim Stanley Robinson.  A human is forced to use an inaccurate translating machine to avert a war between two alien cultures.  A deft portrayal of cunning deception, and the loose translations generated by the machine show Robinson to be herself a master of language.<br />\\"One Night in Television City\\" by Paul DiFilippo.  The story itself is rather blah, but DiFilippo creates a narrative voice that is very Raymond Chandler-esque while advancing the slang and idioms a few hundred years.  The word choices and the language that ensues is a fine example of a technical mastery of the written word (it is just unfortunate that the substance does not live up to the technique).<br />\\"Alimentary Tract\\" by Scott Baker describes a world where gluttony is punished by allowing the glutton to gorge himself; all calories are diverted to needy families in Southeast Asia.  An intriguing idea played to out to wonderful comedic and insightful effect.<br />\\"The Songs the Anemone Sing\\" by Grania Davis is a powerful, moving tale of inter-species (platonic) love.  Davis' ability to evoke powerful emotions in fifteen pages is astonishing.<br />\\"Love Is a Drug\\" by Leah Alpert is, perhaps, the highlight of the book.  In Alpert's society, couples must undergo drug therapy before they can be divorced.  Occasionally, though, the therapist injects the wrong drug!  Wildly entertaining, and a pure pleasure from the opening line to the satisfying ending.<br />Amidst such excellent stories, Ursula K. LeGuin's contribution, \\"The Shobie's Story\\" is the only actual disappointment.  Which isn't to say that the Shobie's story is a dull one; it's just that one expects perfection from the author of The Left Hand of Darkness and perfection isn't present here.<br />One final observation, several of the stories are post-apocalyptic, which is somewhat surprising given the stories were written in 1989/1990 when the Cold War seemed to be coming to an end and world-wide optimism was high.  Once upon a time science fiction was the literature of the hopeful; not for several of these writers.<br />Overall, Universe 1 is a very worthwhile collection, one that should be appreciated by not only science fiction fans, but also fans of good literature in general.	2003-04-15

Like its immediate predecessor, it seems to have no real theme other than the use of violent means to achieve noble ends.  The promising theme of The Sleeping Dragon - the adaptation of people from our world to a fantasy world - has been all but abandoned.  What we are left with is not much more than entertainment; enjoyable but neither provocative nor moving.<br />To be fair, there is a suggestion that the true plot of the series is a long-term effort by erstwhile professor Deighton to control the fantasy world.  Deighton even makes an appearance in The Silver Crown.  It could be that an incredibly complex storyline is about to emerge, in which case my opinion of books two and three may have to be revisited.  For now, however, I remain of the view that The Silver Crown is a harmless read that should be enjoyed by most fantasy readers who don't mind a bit of violence in their stories.	2003-04-10

The characters, having been imported into a Dungeons &amp; Dragons world from our own, are now completely ensconced and resigned to staying.  There is no longer any disconnect between the characters and their setting and, except for a certain sense of greater superiority, there is little to distinguish our heroes from any other fantasy character.  Also problematic is that the narrative focus has shifted entirely onto Karl Cullinane, leaving the far more interesting Ahira in a side-kick role.  There is, however, an intriguing plot development involving erstwhile professor Deighton, whose resolution appears to await later books.<br />Like The Sleeping Dragon, The Sword and the Chain is an incredibly quick read.  It's not always enjoyable (do we really need to read about disembowelments that sound like a wet fruit exploding?), but it is a fine distraction from our own daily lives.  A worthwhile read for any fantasy fan.	2003-04-07

Sixteen years later, I picked it up at a used book sale and find myself having the same reaction - it is enjoyable, but not great literature.<br />The concept is an interesting one - take a group of college-aged fantasy gamers and put them into their gameworld.  Also interesting is the idea that there would be a personality clash between the people from our world and the characters they inhabit.  Unfortunately, Rosenberg doesn't provide the follow-through on those ideas, contrary to what the other reviewers experienced.  Rather, Rosenberg wants to move the characters from point A to point B and the character development we encounter along the way is spelled out too explicitly; essentially, we are spoon-fed the internal and external character conflicts.  Not that this is a terrible thing if we're simply looking for entertainment, but it is not the mark of a four or five star book.  Jack Chalker creates similar situations to much, much more powerful effect.  <br />Bottom line is that The Sleeping Dragon is pulp fantasy.  It's got action, some humor, and a quest that holds the attention as long one doesn't think about it too much (the &quot;Gate Between Worlds&quot;, we are told, is legendary and nobody's found it, but our heroes are able to look up its location in a library).  It is also an astonishingly fast read.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good read, but warn you not to expect anything more than that.	2003-04-05

It would be impossible, I thought, to novelize over a thousand years of incredibly rich history.  The novel would have to be a resounding disappointment.  And so, despite my deep love of Russian history, I refused to buy Russka until I saw it for a quarter at a used book sale.<br />I'm pleased to say my expectations were wrong.  Rutherfurd has, remarkably, created a novel that covers a broad range of history without losing much of the excitement that pervades each era.  Russka is a series of vignettes, each one skipping as much as nine hundred years or as little as twenty years and, with the exception of the very first story, all entertain and occasionally move.  All the while the background of history unfolds remarkably accurately, with only one minor exception that I noticed.<br />Russka has two serious shortcomings, however.  First, Rutherfurd, perhaps believing he is the equal of Tolstoy (War and Peace) and Solzhenitsyn (August 1914), consistently interrupts the narrative for a history lesson.  While such history lectures are, perhaps, necessary, coming as they do during the stories themselves.  Tolstoy, at least, relegated his history discourses to separate chapters, giving the reader the option of reading them or not.<br />Second, too much of Russka, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries, is recycled material from great Russian novels.  There is a Pechorin-type fatalist from Lermontov's Hero of Our Times.  There's an Oblomov, fat and lazy.  There's a revolutionary from Dostoevsky's The Possessed and a father/son conflict that is almost a carbon copy of Turgenev's novel.  There's even a woman throwing herself under a train ala Anna Karenina.  In each and every case, the Russian original is leagues better than Rutherfurd's retelling.  Readers looking to become immersed in Russia of the 19th and 20th centuries would be much, much better served reading Lermontov, Goncharov, Gogol, etal. than Rutherfurd.<br />And there's a third failing.  The revolutions of 1917, which changed Russia (and the world) forever receive remarkably little attention, and the Communist era with NEP, Stalinism, the Great Patriotic War, the Thaw, stagnation, and perestroika receive practically none at all.  For a novel that appears to be about the impact historical forces have on individuals, this lack is especially staggering.  At no time in human history have so many people had their lives deeply affected for so long by a system of government, yet Rutherfurd chooses to mostly ignore it.  Very disappointing.<br />With all of that being said, for those who want a flavor or Russia without going to the originals could do much worse than Russka.  As entertainment, it works, and it was definitely worth the price I paid.	2003-04-03

Deborah Chester has succeeded in demonstrating that a gripping, enjoyable fantasy story does not require ten volumes and ten thousand pages. Throughout The Sword, The Ring, and The Chalice, Chester brings a whole world to life with settings and people that seem sometimes all too real, and with a pacing that never slacked. Reading Chester has finally turned me off from Robert Jordan; I no longer see the point of investing three weeks in the next Wheel of Time book when I can have much more enjoyable fantasy at less than a third of the time cost.<br />As for The Chalice itself, the conclusion to the series was not as pat as I had feared, although complaints that it was too pat are not without merit. While some of the other criticisms are also understandable, one of the most frustrating aspects of The Chalice is arguably one of its strengths - it is impossible to completely like either of the two main characters because they each keep engaging in self-destructive behavior. When Dain and Alexeika were each young and new to their situations (i.e., in the first two books), it was easier to forgive their faults. By The Chalice, one simply wanted to slap each of them a half dozen times, which speaks highly of Chester's ability to get the reader involved. No flat, one-dimensional \\"hero is always good\\" here.<br />One could also complain about the sometimes too-clever prose, and a mildly annoying attempt to create a medieval-type dialogue (I hate it when characters say \\"nay\\" as if they were horses), but the complaints are minor in comparison with a story that keeps the reader turning pages, and often has the heart racing. This is a series that is well worth the read, and one that is worth revisiting from time to time.	2003-03-19

However, two pages into the author's prologue I began to have doubts.  Brigdon provides a recitation of what her book is *not* about, without ever really telling us what the book *is* about - almost as if she is unsure herself.  And the book itself seems aimless, endlessly wallowing in topics then meandering onto something else.  <br />Brigdon's choices about what information to impart is also less than satisfying.  For example, the book opens with Henry VII landing in South Wales.  We are given precious little of Henry's background, however - pretty much nothing more than that he was born in Pembroke in 1457 and hid there thirteen years later.  Nothing about what shaped him in exile, how he marshalled support for his return, what had brought Richard III to deposition.  Instead, we are given a long-winded expose of the land Henry marched through on his way to Bosworth Field.  Such is typical of the book, with such long meanderings that the reader feels as if he is wading through waist-high water, able to see the shore but unable to reach it.  Far from being &quot;vivid and stylish,&quot; as one reviewer has described it, Brigdon's prose seems all fluff and no substance.	2003-03-15

The Trellisane Confrontation has a story that keeps the attention but never rivets and which, in many ways, is a huge eye-roller.  For example, very early on the Enterprise's bridge is taken over and only Chekov has the gumption to do anything about it - and all he does is try to &quot;kirk&quot; one of the female abductors.  There is also, unfortunately, the problem of changed premises.  Written in 1984, Trellisane's Klingons are much more like our current understanding of Romulans and vice versa.  While we can hardly blame Dvorkin for that, it is discomforting to read about honorable Romulans and the treacherous, honorless Klingons.<br />Be warne.  Whatever pleasure one can have from this book (and there is some, especially with Dr. McCoy) will be completely spoiled if you read the back of the book.  Typically Pocket, it reveals plot points that do not occur until two-thirds into the book.  All you need to know about the book is that it's Star Trek and it's mindless entertainment.	2003-03-05

Only almost, however, because despite an intriguing background story involving alien rule over humanity, Elliott chooses instead to plod, plod, and plod over a grassy plain with Mongol-like nomads who all have east-Slavic names.  One reviewer compared Jaran to a fast-paced Robert Jordan novel.  While, objectively, Jaran is nowhere near as slow to develop as the Wheel of Time series, it certainly *felt* slower.  <br />I tend to agree with all of the criticisms levied against the novel more than I can adopt the gushing praise.  Of the two levels of the story, the intergalactic politics level is far more interesting than the wandering nomad one; unfortunately the wandering nomads consume over 5/6ths of the novel.  Still, it is the intergalactic story that gives the novel its three star rating and which will drive me to read the next book, as well.  Moreover, Elliott is by no means a bad writer.  The problems with Jaran have nothing to do with her prose, but with her plotting.<br />But what about the love story?  I'm not adverse to a good romance, but this was not a good romance.  It was obvious from the moment the male protagonist was introduced that he and the &quot;heroine&quot;, Tess, would end up together and the road to that end was exceptionally unexciting, and the resolution of their relationship unconvincing.	2003-02-25

Captain Kirk is a little too maudlin here, but nevertheless gets plenty of alien female action (and would we expect anything less?) as he finds himself isolated from the Enterprise and surrounded by &quot;New Klingons.&quot;  There is some good McCoy/Spock banter here, but the rest of the crew is limited to cameos (and Chekov, although mentioned, never appears at all).  Bottom line is that Timetrap is a good, quality Trek read, not as outstanding as The Captain's Table's Fire Ship, but by no means a dud.	2003-02-18

Star Trek books are almost by definition entertainment light, and mere entertainment should not, generally, receive more than three stars.  But then along came Diane Carey and Fire Ship, and try as I might I cannot bring myself to give it only three stars.<br />Like Sulu, Picard, and Sisko before her (Kirk had been there before), Janeway stumbles into the incredibly dopey &quot;Captain's Table&quot;, a bar exclusively for captains of ships from all times and places.  Like her predecessors, Janeway must tell a story.  But there the comparisons with previous Captain's Table debacles ends.  Carey  boldly ignores the Captain's Table conventions and lets Janeway tell her story without the constant interruptions that plagued the previous books.<br />And what a story it is.  Janeway finds herself alone with an alien crew, forced to adapt to no longer being in charge and literally swabbing decks.  Carey has found her stride as an author (see the atrocious TNG novel Ghost Ship for an earlier effort), weaving a narrative that is compelling, interesting, and evocative.  There are, inevitably, some bits that do not entirely &quot;work,&quot; but this was the first Trek novel in a long, long time that I a) didn't want to put down and b) looked forward to picking up again.  It is also the first Trek book in recent memory that I actually *want* to read again.  <br />An observation about the negative reviews.  I have never been a big Voyager fan.  I am familiar with the characters, of course, but, except for the Doctor, am not attached to any of them.  So, the lack of other Voyager crew did not bother me in the slightest.  Similarly, I am by no means a Janeway afficionado.  Is &quot;Fire Ship&quot;'s Janeway a realistic portrayal of the original?  I have no idea; it was to my inexpert eye.  However, &quot;Fire Ship&quot; is so enjoyable that the Star Trek aspects of it are really beside the point.  Read &quot;FireShip&quot; and enjoy it for the wonderful tale it is.	2003-02-17

The legend across the top of the cover declares \\"Captain Picard must keep a deadly weapon out of enemy hands!!\\"  The back of the book says Picard must stop all other races from acquiring superweapons.  And there is Jean-Luc's face on the cover.  All balderdash.  Picard plays but a minimal role, and these \\"superweapons\\" are nothing more than red herrings, declared such by Geordi LaForge during the first ten pages.  Instead, the hero of this one is none other than weenie extraordinaire Wesley Crusher.<br />It was with a somewhat nauseated feeling that I realized that Wesley was to play a major role in Balance of Power.  To my utter astonishment, not only did Wesley not bother me, I actually *enjoyed* him.  Ab Hugh has done a wonderful job bringing us a Wesley that is interesting and believable while staying remarkably faithful to the original.  Under his skillful pen (er, keyboard), we can actually appreciate Wesley's need to leave Starfleet and join the Traveler - and since the Wesley Joins the Traveler episode ranks among the worst, that is saying something.<br />The plot is entertaining if somewhat strained.  Other reviewers have complained about the implausibility of a high-stakes auction for what appears to be junk, but one can easily put that aside and enjoy a fun ride featuring two greedy Ferengi (sorry for the redundancy), the Grand Nagus, and, of course, Cadet Crusher.  <br />I disagree with others who complained that the characters did not ring \\"true.\\"  On the contrary, Balance of Power is the best Trek book I have read in a long, long time - the best at capturing the characters, the best at entertaining, and the best at keeping me interested until the very end.  It makes me regret giving out so many three stars to other Trek books.  If only they were all like this . . . .	2003-02-11

Golden has crafted a mesmerizing story that pulls no punches and faithfully, eerily, captures the characters we've come to love.<br />Originally published in four parts, The Lost Slayer starts out slow but builds momentum like a snowball rolling down a hill until the reader is buried in an avalanche of action and emotion.  Nineteen-year old Buffy has found herself catapulted into her twenty-four year old body, and into a world where the vampires control much of Southern California and many loved ones are dead . . . or worse.  No character is sacred to Golden in this alternate future; some never make it to that future, and those that do quickly start dropping like flies.  Look for appearances by Drusilla, Wesley, and even Parker the Slayer Seducer.<br />There are only a couple down-sides to The Lost Slayer.  It starts slow, and the alternate future portion ends a hundred pages before the book does; the final confrontation with an evil bat god falls a little flat after Buffy's experiences in the future. Yet The Lost Slayer is an immensely pleasurable read, a diversion that is impossible to put down once it gets going.	2003-02-10

The organization is roughly chronological, but as we get closer and closer the present time the narrative thread becomes more and more jumbled, jumping from topic to topic and decade to decade.  Tighter chapter contol, like Riasonovsky did in his History of Russia, would have helped; i.e., this is the chapter about Peter the Great's politics, this is one is about culture during Peter's reign, and this is about the economy.  Completely missing are tables or charts - there is not even a list of tsars!  A great deal of text about industrial and agricultural production could have been replaced with pie charts or other graphics.  It is also somewhat astonishing that a general history book would have no pictures.<br />For those already well-versed in Russian history, The Making of Modern Russia will provide few new insights and is rather dry at times.  Russia's history is rich, provocative, and fires the imagination - from Olga in the tenth century, to Alexander Nevsky, Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, and even doddering old Brezhnev - to say nothing of the drama and tragedy of the Bolsheviks.  I fear that one not already familiar with Russia's history will read The Making of Modern Russia and wonder what the big deal is.	2003-02-10

Unfortunately, what I found was a textbook, not a retelling of the myths ala Edith Hamilton.  I am not qualified to opine on The Greek Myths as a textbook; I'll leave that to those reviewers who teach mythology.  As a lay reader, however, The Greek Myths is a bit cumbersome.  Far too many of the myth stories consist of &quot;but others say that his mother was XYZ, or YXZ, or ZXY and that this happened at QRS or TUV, but still others say . . . .&quot;  I found myself skipping entire paragraphs to avoid all of the variants on the main story.  Graves' description of the Trojan War and Odysseus' journey are very well-done but are too little, too late to make the work as a whole truly enjoyable.  The commentaries range from interesting to deadly dull - again, in this lay reader's opinion.<br />Bottom line, if you merely enjoy reading the myth stories you learned in childhood stick with Edith Hamilton.  If you are looking for a more detailed *textbook* (or, as others have said, a *reference* book), then pick up Graves.	2003-01-23

Great joy!&quot;  The rest of the premier episode was hardly encouraging.  It wasn't *terrible*, but it did not inspire great hopes, either.<br />David Gerrold took a generally weak episode and fleshed it out as best as anyone could do, but not even Shakespeare could have turned &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; into a gripping read.  There are, of course, a few problems with changed premises (for example, William &quot;call me Bill&quot; Riker and Picard's obsession with some woman named &quot;Celeste&quot;), but one can hardly blame Gerrold for that.	2003-01-21

In the case of Here Be Dragons, however, it must be done.  The five star reviews are all understandable.  I can appreciate where they are coming from, but I had a very different experience of the book.  There were, in my humble opinion, two major flaws that kept me from enjoying the book as much as the 80 or so others who have reviewed it.<br />First, there is, I feel, a lack of focus.  The novel opens with ten year old Llewellyn, a Welsh boy raised by a Norman lord.  Llewellyn even has his own Obi-Wan type character, Morgan, whose function appears to be to ensure that Llewellyn grows up well-versed in his Welsh heritage.  So, the novel appears to be a coming of age one, with Llewellyn seeking out his destiny, reconciling his Welsh heritage with his Norman upbringing.  But, no, it's about Prince John Lackland and fight to survive against his brothers.  But, no, wrong again - it's about young Joanna who must reconcile the conflicting goals of her father John and her husband Llewellyn.  No, still wrong - it's about the Welsh' struggle to remain independent of England.  Ultimately, the novel is more about Joanna than anything else but it comes off as a vignette approach to historical fiction - we follow one character for a few days, then jump ahead a couple months or years to another character.<br />Frankly, the apparent lack of focus wouldn't be all that troubling if it were not for Penman's attempt to lend authenticity to her dialogue by using stilted grammar.  Overuse of the verb &quot;to do&quot;, use of hackneyed words like &quot;mayhap.&quot;  &quot;I do think John is mayhap angry, Jesu forfend.&quot;  Every single time a character stuck the word &quot;do&quot; or &quot;does&quot; before a verb it was like a splash of cold water, jarring me out of medieval Wales and back into my 21st century living room.  And every character does speak that way, and it do appear on every page.  Writers who intend to draw their readers into their worlds should generally avoid stilted, pseudo-period language as it creates an unnecessary barrier between the modern reader and the historical characters.  (The only writer I can think of who has successfully done it is James Clavell, and that's primarily because he threw caution to the wind and had fun making up ribald, 16th century European dialogue.)<br />With those two huge caveats, Here Be Dragons has some elements worth reading, including an interesting perspective on King John and wonderful lessons in a period of history most of us know very little about.	2003-01-21

Writing in prose ideal for 7-9 year olds, she nevertheless communicates with adults on levels both subtle and profound.  She has masterfully charted the relationship of Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, leading them on a path so believable and so multi-faceted that readers of all ages should be left both moved and impressed.<br />The Day of Reckoning presents both a reconciliation and a growth in the relationship of our two Jedi heroes, as they travel to the planet Telos to track down Qui-Gon's former apprentice, Xanatos.  Watson gives us just enough to bring Telos alive and into the Star Wars universe, while also giving us a plot that is interesting if not gripping.  The highlight of the book is the final confrontation with Xanatos, as Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan grapple with issues of responsibility for the fall and death of others - issues that Obi-Wan will have to face on his own in another thirty years or so.  The Xanatos/Anakin parallels are clear but not overdone, a tasteful preview of what is to come.<br />Day of Reckoning holds its own with the rest of the series, a worthwhile series for anyone who enjoys Star Wars.	2003-01-14
US	44207108	R2LE2J64MN6OWL	0060512806	555229230	Cryptonomicon	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Outstanding but imperfect	I knew I was reading a good book when, about a quarter of the way in, I found myself nostalgic for high school math classes - the first time *that* has ever happened!  Stephenson has managed to accomplish what only a very few writers are able to do - bring out the minutiae of daily life in a way both interesting and entertaining.  Sometimes he does it by reducing life to mathematical equations.  Sometimes it's just a character opining on the banal (like the best way to eat Captain Crunch; it's best to keep the milk separate).  Think Stephen King without the sense of ickiness.<br />Plotwise, the novel consists of two storylines that at first share no connection except a family relationship between characters.  Gradually, however, the stories begin to tie in to each other, coming closer to together - a fascinating process that unfortunately ends with a thud.  Stephenson brings the two threads together but never ties them up, leaving a keen sense of disappointment.<br />Still, Cryptonomicon is immensely enjoyable while you're in the middle of it, and really will make you pine for algebra.	2002-12-31

The Bantam novels in general were much more simple, streamlined affairs than the Pocket novels to follow.  No space wasted on character interaction or inner monologues - just a bare-bones story (pun not intended).<br />Perry's Planet is almost magic in the way it evokes the original series.  The novel sounds and feels uncannily like an episode.  The plot, like so many of the original series episodes, is a recycled hodge-podge from other episodes, including a Landru-esque society and computer program, and a pacifying virus akin to the spores from \\"This Side of Paradise.\\"  A Klingon death vow starts the novel off with a bang but otherwise does not live up to its promise.  Wonderfully concise, Perry's Planet provides a couple of hours worth of mindless, enjoyable entertainment.	2002-12-09

Authors of media tie-ins - like Star Trek and Buffy - run great risks when they focus too much on the characters.  Because the readers are already intimately familiar with the \\"real\\" characters, the interactions may seem fake or untrue.  Conflicts or backgrounds created by the writers may be superceded by later television or movie episodes.  And, ultimately, all the effort spent by the writer to make us care about the characters is wasted.  We *already* care about the characters, or else we wouldn't be reading the book!<br />So very much of Ghost Ship is wasted space.  Riker insults Data.  Geordi throws a tantrum about it.  Riker and Deanna wonder if they can maintain a friendship.  Geordi whines about his VISOR.  Riker wonders if Tasha likes to wear comfortable shoes (yes, that's right).  None of it is particularly moving or interesting.  True, Carey was tasked with writing a Next Generation novel very early on in the series - perhaps before she was able to see any of the episodes?  But that should have been all the more reason to *avoid* character introspection, and focus instead on what could have been an interesting plotline.  The occasionally grossly overdone prose (\\"[Deanna's] eyes, extra large with their touch of alienness, obisidan as eyes that looked out of a Greco-Roman fresco . . . .\\") further keeps Ghost Ship from reaching the three-star plateau that most Trek books earn.	2002-12-06

The Ring is as engrossing a read as its predecessor, The Sword.  However, once the last page is read, you can't help but think that not very much happened after the first hundred pages (almost the exact opposite of The Sword, where not very much happened *during* the first hundred pages).  There are many bright spots here, nevertheless.  The secondary plot involving Alexeika becomes more interesting.  Prince Gavril's character becomes more complex and less an object of loathing.  And the hero Dain comes into his own in a way that leaves the reader on the edge of the seat.  The series remains very much worthwhile.	2002-12-02

The Sword shows that Alien Chronicles was not a fluke, that she is a writer to be sought out and read whenever and wherever possible.<br />Why?  There are so many reasons, including plots full of just the right amount of twists, turns, and surprises.  Settings described in full, lush detail without crossing into Jordanesque filibustering.  An invented world that feels real at all levels.  And, above all, characters that are so fully fleshed out they often seem more alive than your friends and co-workers.<br />The criticisms levied against The Sword are fair, to a point.  Chester's prose, viewed objectively, can be too florid.  While I enjoyed the opening part, there was a desire to see her get on with it; it rarely generates enthusiasm to keep tragedy impending for over one hundred pages.  The plot and characters seem to be lifted from the Alien Chronicles, with, for example, Dain substituting for Ampris and Gavril for Israi.  Yet, all in all, Chester succeeds in drawing the reader in, and once you're in it's impossible to get out.	2002-11-30

Fires of Heaven has a remarkable ending, one that gets the adrenalin flowing, but reaching that end is a long, tedious slog.  Fully half of the novel - the half featuring the mind-numbing adventures of Nynaeve and Elayne - is barely readable.  The portions with Rand are much better than in the previous book, but are too frequently interrupted by more of the Wimpy Women to be fully enjoyed.  It is not that Jordan cannot write women . . . well, okay, he can't, but some of the best moments of Fires of Heaven come when he lets us inside the heads of Min and Siuan Sanche.  But far too often the women characters spend their time complaining about men, only to place themselves in situations where men have to rescue them, all the while obsessing over how much cleavage or leg they or other women are showing.  It's cute for the first few hundred pages of the first book.  By the time one hits page 4000 in the series, however, it is a complete turn-off.<br />It took two weeks to muddle through the thousand pages of this one (and only two hours to get through the last two hundred).  It is a serious question whether book six will be worth the effort.	2002-11-11

Featuring 8 stories from talented authors (including Asprin, Lynn Abbey, Diana Paxson, and C.J. Cherryh), Wings moves the town of Sanctuary into an open guerilla conflict on the street.  Like the other Thieves' World books, the format of different stories occurring in the same location has strengths and weaknesses.  On the one hand, it is intersting to see the different perspectives each writer brings.  On the other hand, interesting ideas generated by one writer or poorly followed up, or not at all.  Too, there have been so many authors writing about so many characters that a glossary has become a must to keep track of who is whom.  Nevertheless, Wings of Omen is an enjoyable, if somewhat dark and depressing at times, read.	2002-10-29

Now we know who the weak link in the TNG novel \\"Doomsday World\\" was.  Is The Romulan Strategem a completely terrible work?  No, it's not.  But it barely passes, and here are some of the reasons why.  First, the packaging.  Yes, I know that Greenberger is not responsible for how the editors assemble the book, but be warned:  1) Ro's role is both minimal and stupid; 2) there is no \\"threat to the Federation\\" despite the exclamation points at the top of the front cover; 3) as we've come to expect with Trek novels, the infamous \\"back of the book\\" is both misleading and preemptive - there isn't much of a Sela/Data \\"alliance,\\" and what there is of it occurs two-thirds into the book.  Way to not give anything away, editors.<br />Second, the poor editing.  There are just plain mistakes throughout.  One particularly frustrating example:  Data sees Geordi standing in a corner at a party, a party where, we are told, there are no chairs.  Three paragraphs later both Data and Geordi are sitting down!  Such sloppiness is aggravating and unacceptable.  (A disclaimer: should you find any typos or other mistakes in this review, remember that *I* am not a professional!)<br />Third, the [bad]sub-plot.  Ro has to play nursemaid to a teen-age boy who develops a crush on her.  Oh, what sheer unadulterated joy . . . . <br />Fourth, lots of annoying little details.  For example, Picard mentions Edgar Allen Poe early on, and suddenly everybody, including Worf, is reading Poe.  Poe-lease!<br />Fifth, constant thoughts by Picard of how beautiful Sela is.  Sorry, folks, but a hotty Sela is not.<br />The only saving graces here are a sympathetic leader of the alien planet at issue, and an ending that is other than the usual good guys always win.  Buy it used, if at all!	2002-10-27

First is the length.  I have nothing against 1000+ page books per se.  Shirer's work, however, could have been several hundred pages shorter but for his near obsessiveness toward recording every detail.  The days leading up to the invasion of Poland, for example, are told almost in \\"real time.\\"  Second is the complete lack of maps.  There is very little more frustrating than to be bombarded with place names and to have only a rough idea of where these places are.  Third is the lack of focus on the Germans themselves, especially once the war starts.<br />Some parts of this book do stand out.  Shirer's two chapters on life in Nazi Germany and the occupied countries are both gripping and horrifying.  Shirer's forays into his own recollections are also welcome diversions from the endless barrage of Nazi documents, memoranda, and diaries and are, perhaps, the best parts of the entire work.  And Shirer's account of the Nazi party's rise is fascinating reading, and shows that, indeed, Hitler and Stalin had more in common than one would have thought.<br />All in all, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a worthwhile read.  It is not great \\"literature\\" in the sense that Gibbon or Will Durant are (contrary to what some others have suggested), but it is an investment in time and attention that will pay off for the reader.	2002-10-22

Cherryh, Asprin, Lynn Abbey, David Drake, and Diana Paxson - with Andrew Offut noticeably and thankfully absent.  The stories range from the grotesquely gripping to the merely entertaining, and overall are more enjoyable than most of the previous Thieves' World books.  The highlight is Paxson's &quot;Mirror Image,&quot; which features the two only endearing characters in all of Thieves' World, the painter Lalo and his wife, Gilla.  Lalo, you see, had been cursed/blessed.  His portraits revealed the inner soul of the subject, not the exterior facade (thus his large, domineering wife appears as a goddess).  In &quot;Mirror Image,&quot; Lalo paints a self-portrait and the result is a very moving tale.  Despite the false packaging (the &quot;invasion&quot; referenced in the title is hardly that, just an omnipresence of mysterious, powerful foreigners), The Face of Chaos is, perhaps, the first Thieves' World book I'd recommend without reservations.	2002-10-21

Rowling, but now I'm beginning to think that I'm deluding myself.  The Captive Temple is, as we've come to expect from Watson, a fantastic read.  Most remarkable of all is the way Watson is able to depict Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, twelve years before The Phantom Menace.  What is masterful is that these both are and are not the characters we saw in the movie; they appear exactly as they must have been in their younger days.  Remarkable.<br />The Captive Temple is also an improvement over the previous book.  Obi-Wan is less mopey (\\"Mopey-Wan\\" . . . hmmm), and Qui-Gon less brooding.  There are no quick fixes to their relationship, broken by Obi-Wan's betrayal of Qui-Gon in book 5, which is satisfyingly frustrating.  Watson seems to have masterly paced the evolution of our Jedi heroes' relationship, giving us just enough development to keep us coming back for more.	2002-10-12

The original Foundation trilogy and the Robot series are canon deservedly so. Unfortunately, Earth Is Room Enough does not do justice to the Grand Master. The stories collected range from the fairly decent to the deadly dull. The sole stand-out is the brief \\"An Immortal Bard,\\" answering the amusing question, \\"What if Shakespeare were alive today and taking a Shakespeare class?\\" Otherwise, the collection is largely forgettable.	2002-10-11

So, I am not going to say how much I enjoyed the book, how provocative the idea of a hermaphroditic society is, how evocative the landscapes are, and how moving the bond that developed between the two main characters.  Rather, I am going to let those fans of Julian May who have not read Left Hand of Darkness know that here is the model for everything we love and adore about May.  Like May, LeGuin is adept at changing view-points (a rare feat; most writers who try to give multiple first-person perspectives, or interrupt the narrative with asides, fail miserably).  Like May, LeGuin has phenomenously captured the male character.  Nobody can read May's Rampart trilogy without being astounded that a woman wrote it.  The same is true of Left Hand of Darkness; perhaps even more so because reflections on sexuality are a critical element of the story.  And, like May, LeGuin creates a world so effortlessly convincing that one almost believes it's right next door.  It's the apparent lack of effort that stands out here; LeGuin is able to accomplish in a couple hundred pages what it takes other writers (see Wingrove or Jordan) half a dozen books to achieve.  About halfway through I became convinced that May and LeGuin must be the same person . . . .<br />I do not give out five star ratings lightly.  Only one other fiction review has ever received a five-star rating from me, and that's one from Julian May.  I wrestled long and hard over whether to accord Left Hand of Darkness the Ultimate Rating.  The more I thought about it, the more I realized that the only complaint I had about the book was that it was over too quickly.  Surely that, as much as anything else, merits five stars.	2002-09-19

It lacks any true depth, of course, and posits no new ideas or perspectives.  It taxes the brain not at all.  It is, however, a fine action story with extremely well-depicted secondary characters, a rarity in most Trek novels.  In fact, the secondary characters, including the captain and engineer of the pirate ship Helios and a Cardassian commander forced to kow-tow to Gul Dukat, grab interest before any of the regular DS9 characters do.  As for the regulars, after a few dozen pages of hokey introspection about each other, they emerge &quot;true to life&quot;, with Kira and Odo in particular showing off their best traits (Kira shooting her mouth off without thinking, and Odo scowling at everything in sight).  Scott's effort has earned my interest in other books she has written.<br />The only serious caveat is to beware the infamous back of the book.  The description given by the publisher is misleading; there is no Sisko/Dukat alliance, for example.  Moreover, the back gives away a major plot point that does not occur until page 200 or so (in a 270 page book).  So, don't read the back of the book, but pick it up, read it, and enjoy it as it is meant to be enjoyed - as mindless, harmless entertainment.	2002-09-19

Well, technically, they did it *before* in Blooded, but as I read The Gatekeeper first . . . . Golden and Holder are masters at capturing the personalities of the Buffy characters.  Almost without exception, the reader can *hear* the lines being spoken Sarah Michelle Gellar, et al.  (Sometimes they are *too* successful, in fact; reading, \\"Um, yes, of course\\" from Giles over and over and over again can be tiring.)  The plot is an interesting one, involving the importation of medieval spirits from China and Japan; flashbacks to the Far East flesh out these spirits and give the final conflict between them more resonance than a simple \\"evil dudes, use stake\\" battle.  <br />Blooded is not, by any means, a perfect tie-in.  The story drags at times and other reviewers have been justified in noting that the dynamic between the characters does not seem quite right.  In fairness to the authors, we really do not know how much information was available to them when they wrote the novel.  It appears they knew that Angel killed Jenny Calendar, but not the circumstances surrounding Angel's \\"resurrection.\\"  So, while *we* know that there remained a great deal of distrust between the Scooby Gang and Angel, and that Angel and Buffy themselves no longer slept together (literally slept!) to avoid temptation, the authors probably did not.  And so they have Willow, Xander, et al., constantly thinking about how Angel tried to kill them, \\"but he was Angelus then, so that's okay.\\"  Golden and Holder should not have been expected to exactly predict the direction the series was going to go in.<br />Blooded is, however, an enjoyable, quick and painless read, one which should be enjoyable to all Buffy fans.	2002-09-03

The final episode of DS9's second season, &quot;The Jem Hadar,&quot; was simply incredible, ranking up there with TNG's &quot;The Best of Both Worlds Part I&quot; for sheer action, drama, suspense, and overall thrills.  Who didn't get a shiver down their spine when the Odyssey was destroyed?  Who didn't laugh when Quark complained about bugs in his jambalaya?<br />The problem with tremendous finales, of course, is that it builds up huge expectations for the follow-up.  And &quot;The Search&quot; failed miserably to live up to the promise of &quot;The Jem Hadar.&quot;  Sure, it was cool to see the Defiant's rapid-fire blowing up an enemy ship and to see Sisko literally go down fighting, but the rest of the two-parter was a dud.  Watching Odo constantly mope was painful, as was seeing Kira's &quot;I'm worried about Odo&quot; face.  And the &quot;surprise&quot; resolution was trite, hackneyed, anti-climactic, and unconvincing.<br />Along comes Diane Carey, whose only other Star Trek novel I'd read, Best Destiny, ranks among the worst books ever put to paper - so awful I couldn't make it through even a third.  Yet, surprisingly, and to her credit, Carey turned a bad episode into a decent read.  She succeeds in several different ways.  She fully fleshes out the change in Sisko's attitude toward Bajor (represented in the episode by Sisko's query to Jake, &quot;When did this Cardassian monstrosity become home to me?&quot;), making it both convincing and moving.  She adds scenes not seen in the episode, including Dax's and O'Brien's adventures on the relay station (in the episode, they are captured immediately).  Of course, Carey's not a miracle worker.  Kira is as painful to read as she was to see, and not even a J.K. Rowling could have saved the ending.  In the end, Carey brings us a serviceable Trek novel, neither better nor worse than the vast majority of them.	2002-08-30

The novel succeeds on nearly every basic level.  The moves briskly, striking a fine balance between action, mystery, and dialogue.  The characters all seem true to the television series, with some particularly good Spock/McCoy interplay.  The story, involving the threatened assassination of most of the Federation's top scientists, is, perhaps, not exceptional but it gets the job done.  There are a few issues that prevent the book from receiving four stars, however.  For one, the ending - like almost every Trek book - is too contrived, too pat.  For another, the novel is graced with a very intriguing cover - a cover that bears no resemblance to any plot point whatsoever.  Still, Memory Prime is a good read and worth the time of any Trek fan.	2002-08-20

However, Phantom Islands does not live up to its billing.  To read the title and the book jacket, one would expect the book to be primarily about *legends* - tales of mysterious islands inhabited by wondrous people and creatures.  One would think, too, that the cartography of the Atlantic would be secondary - an interesting side-note, but not the focus.<br />The opposite is true.  Johnson gives an all-too brief description of the &quot;phantom island&quot; at issue, then launches into an exhaustive recitation of the island's appearance on maps; how so and so in 1524 put the island here, while such and such twenty years later moved it ten miles further south.  It quickly becomes old.<br />Let me emphasize that my grievance stems largely from feeling misled.  I opened the book expecting X and got Q instead.  If one is looking for a history of cartography, this book probably deserves the five stars others have given it.  But if you are looking for tales of legendary, vanished isles look elsewhere.	2002-08-16

Saylor remains a master of the written word, crafting a novel that flows seamlessly and effortlessly draws the reader into Ancient Rome.  Yet Rubicon strikes with a very different impact from all of the preceeding Roma Sub Rosa novels.  For one thing, the prose, while still enjoyable, lacks the power that was evident at times in earlier books.  For another, it appears that Saylor has once and for all eschewed mystery in favor of straight historical drama.  Although Rubicon begins with a mysterious dead body, the mystery surrounding it disappears quickly; instead, Gordianus becomes deeply enmeshed in the struggle between Caesar and Pompey, spending a great deal of time with Cicero's former slave, Tiro (who turns out to be a character best met in moderation; he suffers from prolonged exposure).  Finally, Rubicon is much too short and too fast-paced - it's almost Saylor-lite.  All of these things are not *necessarily* bad, but leave me feeling apprehensive about the next book.	2002-08-09

He very clearly enjoyed his subject matter and his enthusiasm carries over to the reader.  There is almost nothing revelatory here - Havel is no Will Durant with prose to leave you breathless, or a Christian Meier to make you reflect on the very nature of human ambition and government. Rather, Havel is a fine narrator, relating the events of Ancient Rome in a manner always enjoyable and never dull.	2002-08-06

So let me begin by declaring that the two star rating is meant to solely be a reflection of how little *I* *enjoyed* the book; I'll leave reviews of Dio's historiographical and literary qualities to those more qualified.<br />For those who, like me, read Roman history more for enjoyment than any academic interest, Dio's history of Augustus is painfully dry.  Missing is the eloquence of Livy, the scandals of Tacitus, the drama of Plutarch.  What is left is a bare recitation of facts: so and so was made consul; Augustus increased this department to thirteen people instead of ten; Augustus went on a trip.  And every few books there is a long speech that does little to further the history (the sole exception is Augustus' speech to the Senate early in his reign saying he wishes to retire; as Dio tells it, it was less &quot;I'm tired and want to rest&quot; than &quot;I can do whatever the heck I want, I hold total supreme power, but I am such a magnanimous person that rather than treat you all like the slaves you are, I'm going to retire&quot;).  Even the famous &quot;debate&quot; between Agrippa and Maecenas over whether Octavian should assume sole power falls flat.  The only truly enjoyable moments are the opening chapter featuring Antony and Cleopatra and Dio's description of the massacre of Varo's legions in Germany.  Beyond that, those who want an enjoyable read about Augustus' reign are better off reading Robert Graves &quot;I, Claudius.&quot;  True, it's fiction, but you get the same information you get from Dio with a lot more fun!	2002-07-27

The Children of Hamlin, however, doesn't rise above the level of an average Trek book - a pleasant diversion, but nothing more.  Like so many Next Gen episodes, Children of Hamlin is saddled with both an inane subplot (involving the ever-popular technology-impaired wandering farmers; fortunately, these don't talk with Irish accents!)and too much Wesley.  Its main story, though, about efforts to reclaim children abducted by aliens fifty years before, raises interesting philosophical, moral, and ethical issues that are only given lip service by Picard and the crew.  But, then, if you're looking for insights into philosphical, moral, and ethical issues you're not likely to be reading a Star Trek book, are you?	2002-07-21

Every book of his that I have read has been engrossing, quickly drawing the reader in. Orion is no exception, transporting the reader from such extremes as Saturn's moons to a glacier-covered prehistoric Earth. If you simply sit back and let's Bova take you on his ride, Orion can be enjoyable, but, like an A&E Biography on cable, it regards itself as a more serious work than it is. Ostensibly, Bova is trying to talk about the nature of humanity itself, our origins and our development. With such a profound topic, one would expect grand insights. Instead, we end up with a pot-boiler plot with a somewhat hackneyed conclusion. Ultimately, Orion ends up being nothing more than mindless entertainment. Satisfactory for a Star Trek novel, but a let-down from Bova.	2002-07-19

What a relief to read The Stainless Steel Rat Wants You after the disappointing Stainless Steel Rat in Hell!  What a difference fifteen years can make!  <br />This Stainless Steel Rat is the Rat we all fell in love with - biting sarcasm, acerbic wit, the lapses in attention that land him in trouble, the daring escapes from that trouble, and a plot that moves briskly at all times, always staying a half step ahead of the reader.  Just under 150 pages, it is just the right length; short enough to be read in one sitting, but long enough to draw the reader in.<br />The only downside to this one is the packaging.  Contrary to the title and cover propaganda, the Rat does no recruiting (beyond his lovely yet dangerous wife and the twins).  A better title would have been, The Stainless Steel Rat:  Bug-eyed Alien Sex Goddess.  Read the book and you'll see what I mean.	2002-07-16

Unfortunately, it's most powerful event, the death of a major character, had been spoiled by reading the summary of Jedi Knights in the Star Wars Insider; I knew the character was going to die, just didn't know when or how.  In the event, the death seemed . . . contrived.  For no apparent reason, the character (already wounded) decides he must take on several dozen enemy, ultimately failing to kill Nom Anor even though he's a hairsbreath away from him . . . .<br />And there is an example of why Star by Star, I think, doesn't get more than three stars.  Putting aside the plot points (for which Denning probably deserves neither blame nor praise, save that for the editors who control the series!), too many of the battle scenes were too difficult to follow.  There's a lot of head-scratching: \\"How did that character end up over there?  What happened to the other guy?  Now, wait a tick, who was that guy, again?\\"  Zahn, Stackpole, and Allston were masters of the large space battles; Dennings end up more confusing than anything else.<br />As for those plot points . . . well, it is depressing and frustrating to have spent so much time watching a character develop only to see it end.  This character was, perhaps, the most thought out character of the whole NJO series and now he's no more.  Beyond that, judgment, I think, should remain suspended until the series ends. Sure, there's a lot to complain about it if you're into complaining.  Personally, I was getting tired of the latest \\"superweapon\\" plot; I laughed in derision when Darksaber came out.  In the end, if we're not satisfied, we can always pretend it never happened.  That's what I did with the atrocious Dark Empire comic series, after all . . .	2002-07-14

One would expect an anthology titled \\"Space Soldiers: Nine Visions of the Future of War\\" to be a slam-bang collection of shoot-'em uppers, a cover to cover ensemble of Starship Troopers, Forever War, and Enders Game, and perhaps even the Rogue Squadron series for good measure.  One should know better.<br />In Space Soldiers, only three of the stories, \\"Moon Duel\\" by Fritz Leiber, \\"Time Piece\\" by Joe Haldeman and \\"The Orion Line\\" by Stephen Baxter, come close to fitting the bill; at least they feature soldiers under combat conditions.  Those three stories are, in fact, the standouts, although \\"Time Piece\\" reads too much like an early draft of The Forever War.  \\"Masque of the Red Shift\\" is an excerpt from Fred Saberhagen's Berserker, and not the best excerpt available.  \\"Galactic North\\" by Alastair Reynolds suffers from too compact a format; it make a decent novella, but as a short story it is too forced and scattered.  The other stories are fairly weak (except for \\"Soldiers Home\\" by William Barton which is just plain bad).<br />There have been many great science-fiction soldier tales told, including Timothy Zahn's Cobra and Blackcollar series.

Remini focuses exclusively on Jackson - his actions, his statements, and his correspondence.  We are given virtually no flavor of the other personalities involved.  Most disappointing, the Indians themselves are never fleshed out, except in passing.  We learn nothing of their culture, or even their armed forces (were they all armed with muskets?  Did they employ mounted attacks?  Did they capture, have, or use any artillery?)  For that matter, we do not even learn much of Jackson's own armies - how many field pieces did they have?  How were they transported through the swamps?  For a book about Indian *Wars*, these omissions are glaring.<br />Nor does Remini himself provide any great insights.  In the final chapter he recites the view of another historian that removal of Native Americans from the East was the most palatable of four bad choices.  Having spent 280 pages with him, it would have been nice to have heard Remini's own view of alternative &quot;solutions&quot; to the white/Indian tensions.	2002-06-29

It feels good, it's enjoyable, and it's familiar.  Alas, with Potshot it's clear that the Spenser slippers are beginning to smell . . . . <br />Potshot is still, like all of Parker's works, a fast and painless read.  It is only when you're finished that you realize just how stale and disappointing it was.  Spenser is once again away from Boston (always a bad sign), this time rounding up five mafia hitmen, a gay bouncer, and Hawk to fight some thugs from a place called \\"the Dell.\\"  <br />Neither Spenser nor Susan have had any life-altering experiences since A Catskill Eagle in the mid-80s; surely it is time for them to develop?  Instead, the Spenser in Potshot is little more than a facade.  The old Spenser cared about people, tried to find out *why* people behaved the way they did; there was no \\"black and white\\" in Spenser's world.  Why, then, doesn't Spenser explore the culture of the Dell?  Why aren't we told what motivates the Dell denizens to follow the mysterious Preacher?  Once upon a time Spenser, while respecting their abilities, would not have voluntarily associated with mafioso like Vinnie Morris and Chollo - their lack of moral code (as opposed to honor code) being repugnant to him, Hawk the only exception; now he's as comfortable with them as with Susan.  Hawk himself has become one of the crowd, having lost his uniqueness; he's now little different from Vinnie, Chollo, or Bobby Horse.  <br />I seem to recall that in the early 80's (around the time of Valediction) Spenser began to show signs of age.  He needed to write things down on cardfiles, he may even have needed reading glasses.  That stopped fairly quickly, and it seemed as though Spenser and Susan stopped aging; there were no more references to Korea (as if Spenser had never been), and even Paul Giacomin(?) stopped coming around after he hit his early 20s.  That Spenser in Potshot reflectsback on Korea is then all the more jarring.  Even assuming he was 18 in 1953, he's 66 in 2001!  Time for Susan to start getting senior discounts in her shopping sprees.  And, alas, perhaps time to throw away the slippers.	2002-06-21

Yoda giving Qui-Gon a chewing out (sorry, \\"Yoda a chewing out giving Qui-Gon, hmmmm?\\"), a touching scene with Cerasi's father, and the lack of quick resolution to the Obi-Wan/Qui-Gon conflict.

Focusing on one plot line, it drew us in and never let us go.  Rebirth suffers from an attempt to do too much in too short a space, making it more difficult to become engrossed in any one plot.  As several others have mentioned, each storyline is independent of the others, making one wonder why they are all included.  A focus on only one of the stories - e.g., Anakin and Tahiri's recovery from Conquest - would have been better.  And there are some details that are unconvincing or disturbint - Luke and Mara Force \\"revelation\\" at the end, and Kyp Durron's pedophiliac leers toward Jaina Solo (she's still only 17!  Let's keep the PG rating here!)<br />That being said, there is still much to be enjoyed.  Keyes style is evocative of the original movies, keeping things fast-paced and interesting throughout.  The action scenes, while sometimes too brief, are well-described, and the Anakin and Tahiri interaction is tastefully and touchingly explored.<br />The viewpoint of the naysayers about the minimal role played by the older generation is certainly understandable; I particularly miss Lando.  I do not believe, however, that the emphasis on the Solo children automatically turns the NJO series into another Young Jedi Knights.  Jacen and Jaina aren't all that much younger than Luke and Leia were in Episode IV, or Anakin Skywalker in Episode II.  Young characters do not mean a juvenile target audience.  I have found nothing about the style, the plot, or the story to warrant the labeling of this or the other NJO books as \\"juvenile.\\"	2002-06-17

Writing in lively prose, with occassional editorial comments, McAleavy traces the political history of China from the 1840s through the early 1960s.  Coverage of periods and topics is sometimes sporadic, with the overview of early Communist China feeling particularly rushed and dry.  There is also a tendency to assume facts not generally known. For example, in the discussion of the Boxer rebellion McAleavy writes, \\"In the summer of 1900 there occurred the great slaughter of the innocent which has left so foul a stain on the reputation of the country.\\"  What slaughter, where it took place, and how many were killed are never discussed.  <br />Those criticisms aside, there is much here that is often forgotten today, including how corrupt and often brutal Chiang Kai-shek's reign was, or atrocities committed by the European powers in response to the Boxer revolt.  It is also full of colorful personalities, including the \\"Pig-tailed General\\" and the blustering American General Stilwell.  Worth picking up if you can find it.	2002-06-12

Keyes has presented us with an epic tale of a young hero who must confront his own inner demons as well as monstrous foes in a quest to redeem himself.  Conquest is, as another reviewer has observed, a classic &quot;hero quest,&quot; and as such is a welcome return to the mythological underpinning of the entire Star Wars saga.  <br />Keyes' style is both fluid and engrossing.  The characters imported from Junior Jedi Knights are fully fleshed out and much more enjoyable than in their original venue.  We are caught up in Anakin Solo's adventure, truly experiencing what he experiences and caring deeply about those things that matter to him.  The story has its twists and turns, always leaving us on the edge of the seat.  Even the Yuuzhan Vong are made interesting, as we see sides to their culture only hinted at in other works; we are finally given, as Anakin himself observes, Yuuzhan Vong who are not *enemies* but *people.*  Keyes brings a new perspective to the New Jedi Order series, a much welcome one.<br />What prevents Conquest from receiving a five star rating is that its ending is too pat.  Anakin's friend Tahiri undergoes an experience that cries out for an in-depth treatment (an experience that Jack Chalker's characters inevitably go through), but the potential is not followed up on.  I cannot say more without completely spoiling the end, unfortunately.<br />Fans of adventure stories, as well as fans of Star Wars, should enjoy this one, even those who have not been following along with the rest of the series.	2002-06-12

Unfortunately, the first half of Deceptions is completely uninspiring, with Obi-Wan even more immersed in his own insecurities than usual.  Part two picks up, fortunately, and saves the book.  Now we have an Obi-Wan in nearly every way consistent with the Obi-Wan of Episode II, and Anakin (now 12), while still retaining some of the wide-eyed wonder of The Phantom Menace, shows some traits that come to dominate his personality in Attack of the Clones - a fine feat of forecasting by Watson.  The three star rating I have given the book is due to the fine Obi-Wan/Anakin characterizations.<br />While Part Two is better written than Part One, neither has a plot that holds interest.  The story is dull and predictable, even by the standards of \\"young adult\\" fiction.  Perhaps the *very* young adults will find something of interest or surprise.  We older adults, however, will find Deceptions to be like a Twinkie - sweet tasting at times but not filling.	2002-06-11

Hannibal - implausibly - gives the Roman's the option of exile.  Over one hundred years later a once-again powerful Rome seeks to return to the Mediterranean.<br />Other than Hannibal's gaffe, Roberts' vision rings true in nearly every respect.  One cannot help but believe that this exactly how the western world would have looked after a Punic victory.  Unfortunately, Roberts' prose is average at best and at times plodding:  the Grisham of alternative history novels, if you will.  Some maps, any maps, would have been helpful also, especially for picturing the extent of the Roman Norican empire.<br />Overall, Hannibal's Children is an amusing tale but by no means fine literature.	2002-06-02

That Rusch and Smith accomplished it redounds to their credit.  Too bad for them that the feat is about as exciting as watching grass grow.<br />The interaction at the bar is the best so far in the series.  The story told by Sisko is the weakest.  And the constant (sometimes two or three times on a single page) interruptions become infuriating at times.  Sisko's story, by itself, would fill perhaps 75 pages; thanks to the bar dialogue, it gets dragged out over 240 pages.<br />There are only two things preventing me from giving this book one star.  First, I don't believe it would be gentlemanly to punish Rusch and Smith for fleshing out a bad idea as well as it could be.  Second, there is one great moment at the end of the book.  As Sisko leaves the bar, he sees in the darkness a woman that looks like . . . . but, no, he concludes.  It can't be.  She was killed in the Badlands, lost with her starship, years ago . . . .	2002-06-02

The four previous Stainless Steel Rat books I had read were all full of acerbic wit, tight action, and amazing (yet credible) escapes.  This one is lacking in nearly every category.

Having missed the significance of \\"Civil War *ERA*\\" when I picked this book up, I was at first deeply frustrated over the 250 page wait before Lincoln was elected.  At first, that is, because those 250 pages were full of great insights and facts completely unknown to me, including several American attempts to conquer Cuba (in true Bay of Pigs style, no less!), and bloody massacres in Kansas that rival the outrages being committed today throughout the world.<br />McPherson truly hits his stride with the commencement of hostilities.  His narrative of the war itself is nearly masterful, covering all of the major campaigns and showing how each campaign affected the moral of both governments and civilian populations.  <br />Unfortunately, the book ends as soon as the war does.  We are given a great build-up for the Reconstruction, having watched Lincoln's political maneuverings between moderate and radical Republicans, then get shut out in the cold.  We come to admire and respect Lincoln, but do not get to experience the shock and grief of his assasination.  Allegedly those topics are covered in the \\"next book in the series,\\" but what that book is (or, for that matter, what the series is) is not revealed in this edition.<br />A brief observation for those who complained about a bias in this book.  I, too, noticed McPhersons previous writing credits.  Frankly, I appreciated the perspective his previous works gave him.  I do not believe the South came out looking any worse than the North in this work.  On the contrary, the North did not look good at all.  From what McPherson relates, very very few Northerners supported the war (initially) to end slavery; racism was every bit as rampant north of the Ohio as it was in the South - the campaign platforms of the Democratic party in the 1860, 1862, and  1864 were utterly appalling and yet not without success.  Those who have complained about a \\"Northern bias\\" seem to be doing so because McPherson dares to say that the South fought for slavery.  Well, didn't it?  As McPherson observed, the only \\"states rights\\" issue that truly mattered to people in the 1840s through 60s was slavery.  Moreover, McPherson makes the interesting claim that the Northerners were the true \\"rebels,\\" that the South was fighting to preserve what had been theretofore been the true America.	2002-05-28

Beautiful vistas, intense action, gorgeous Senator . . . . The novelization completely fails to communicate that grandeur to the printed page and, as a result, falls somewhat flat.  See the movie *before* you read the book!<br />The novel is still worth reading as a supplement to the movie.  There are some scenes and dialogue that give a different perspective to the movie.  (Two examples:  Count Dooku attempts to sway Padme to his cause, and the Kaminoan prime minister acknowledges to Obi-Wan that occasionally clones may have \\"issues\\".)  It does not, however, stand well on its own.  Vector Prime was a much better Star Wars effort for Salvatore.	2002-05-20

It is standard Trek fare, not likely to linger in the memory for very long, but written in an engaging way.  There are some flaws, of course, including a holodeck scene with Homer reciting the story of Cassandra (absent from the Odyssey; Virgil or Aeschylus would have been more accurate).  However, it was good to see Pulaski again.   Unlike every other character in Trek, we all know and have worked with a Pulaski-type; she was the most &quot;real&quot; of all Trek characters, and Friedman does a fine job of capturing her orneriness.  Overall, A Call to Darkness is worth any Trek fan's time.	2002-05-05

His prose is always delightful, and often remarkable.  On nearly every page, one can find a turn of phrase, or an insight, that makes one stop and say, &quot;wow.&quot;  The words Durant uses to describe Cicero's writing apply equally well to his own:  &quot;How pleasant [Durant's English] is, how easy to read, how smoothly and clearly the stream of language flows!  When he narrates events he catches some of the vivacity that made his speeches chain attention; . . . when he lets himself go he flowers into the balanced clauses and crashing periods which he had learned from Isocrates, and with which he had made the Forum resound.&quot;  &quot;Stream of language.&quot; &quot;Crashing periods.&quot;  Brilliant.  Better than even Gibbon, for Durant had mastered the ability to be concise as well as prosaic.<br />With his skill, Durant could make even a book about paint drying interesting.  That his subject matter is one of the most fascinating periods in history is but icing on the cake.  Durant provides a fascinating overview, laced with insights.  Every page is both a pleasure and informative.  The book is not for those of small attention spans, however; it's length may be daunting.  Prepare to devote a large amount of time to reading it, but be assured that it will be time well-spent.	2002-05-05

Like every collection from a variety of authors, it represents a mixed bag.  At its best, like Beatrice Caseau's \\"Sacred Landscapes,\\" it is eye-opening and provocative. (Caseau describes for us how pagan temples became Christianized, or how Christian holy sites were transformed into Muslim sites - a question that likely would never occur to the lay reader, but once asked demands answering.)  Not every article is as enticing however.  For example, Henry Chadwick misses a great opportunity with \\"Philosophical Tradition and the Self.\\"  Rather than relate to us just how individuals in late antiquity viewed the self, Chadwick chooses to desribe debates between late antiquity writers; only professors hopelessly lost in academia could possibly care about Iamblichus' criticisms of Porphyry.<br />The final half of the book is taken up with an encyclopedia, whose entries are . . . eclectic.  The Emperor Maurice is absent, for example, but Ephrem (a Syrian deacon and hymnist) receives nearly two columns of treatment.  Nor is there an entry for Arianism, but the Donatists get an extensive write-up.<br />There is much to enjoy and learn from in Late Antiquity.  The articles by Cameron, Caseau, Geary, Shaw, and Lim alone make a trip to the local library well worthwhile.  Whether the book is a must for the lay reader's library is more difficult to say.	2002-05-05

It seems like every five pages we're back to a multi-page Yankees story, and if it's not the Yankees, it's the Mets.  Several successful teams are grossly underrepresented; we hear about the Pirates, for example, only from Rennie Stennett.  Several spectacular players are also rarely mentioned; Lou Brock appears only near the end and only as an afterthought, for example.<br />What there is in this book is very well done, however, and a treat for those who remember baseball in the 70s - or for those who don't, and have no idea just what it meant to play against Pete Rose.	2002-04-22

Almost all of the pleasure one could get from it is sapped by the ever-increasing interruptions that return us to the far-too hokey Captain's Table bar.  The interruptions do not, as one reviewer suggested, lend a sense of realism.  Rather, they continually remind us how contrived the whole set up is.  As with War Dragons, the tale itself is *not* written in the way one would expect a story to be told at a bar, and Picard's voice is not always captured.  My advice to those who are about to read this one:  read only the chapters captioned \\"Tale.\\"  Skip all of the others.<br />Michael Jan Friedman is ordinarily among the best of the Trek writers; it is unfortunate that he allowed himself to get roped into the Captain's Table idea.  A fine talent, an interesting challenge (a first-person Picard tale), but a wasted effort.	2002-04-07

Ordinarily, it would be entitled to the standard three stars that decent Trek novels are awarded.  Unfortunately, the promise of having some of Trek's greatest novelists (Carter, David, and Friedman) teaming together falls way short of the mark.  With few exceptions, each of their individual Trek novels have been several cuts above the norm; that Doomsday World never rises above the average makes the result all the more disappointing.<br />There are some good moments, including Worf saving the day with a barrage of phaser fire (then griping that if he'd been allowed to blast away when he'd wanted to they could have avoided a host of problems) and an amusing, if out of place, Monty Python reference (&quot;What's the average air speed of an unladen swallow?&quot; Geordi asks a bartender).<br />If you are going to read this one, do it because it's a Trek novel, not because of who the authors are . . . .	2002-04-03

As the President gives a speech in Boston, a body is found in an alley outside - a body that resembles the President in every way.  Who was it?  Who killed it, and why?  Almost (but not quite) against his will, the President's press secretary is drawn into the mystery.  Ultimately, the reader ends up being way ahead of the characters, but the ride, as one expects from Bova, is entertaining.<br />The novel takes place in an unspecified time, but probably around the late 1990's.  It is always interesting to compare how the future actually unfolded to the way an author hypothesized.  Fortunately, urban America has not imploded as Bova theorized.  Even more fortunately, videophones have not become the norm.  Interestingly, in the background of The Multiple Man is an invasion of Kuwait - this time by the Shah of Iran instead of Iraq (and isn't it strange to think of a world in which the Ayatollah never took power?).  Bova wisely kept societal and technological changes in the background, so the conflicts between his future society and our own are noticeable but not distracting.	2002-03-25

In part two of The Gods Themselves, Asimov reaches a level of prosaic abilities he never achieved in any of his other works.  Asimov creates a strong emotional attachment between the reader and Odeen, Dua, and Tritt.  The effect he accomplishes has less to do with a well-designed alien culture than with a knack for showing the deepest feelings of these beings, feelings that are based on another culture but which we find ourselves relating to.<br />That we end up caring so much about Odeen, Dua, and Tritt, only makes the other two parts of the book that much more uninspiring.  The human characters, while not entirely cardboard, lack the depth of the aliens.  Mostly it's because of a stylistic change.  We see Odeen, Dua, and Tritt primarily through their own self-introspection.  The humans are developed entirely through dialogue; we are never given a peek into their heads and so, frankly, don't really care about them.<br />Parts one and three aren't terrible, but standing by themselves they are unmemorable.  Part two, however, deserves to be read by every fan of the creative imagination.  Without intending to take anything away from the first three Robot novels (in my opinion, Asimov's overall best fiction works), I submit that part two of The Gods Themselves deserves all of the accolades that have been heaped upon it.	2002-03-14

Despite an awkward beginning (a contrived explanation by Gordianus to his daughter about the Roman government), Murder on the Appian Way quickly throws the reader into the turmoil that marked Rome in the 50s B.C.  Much better written than McCullough's Masters of Rome series, it also provides a point of view of major events from someone other than the major players, while still showing us the human side of such figures as Cicero and Marc Antony.

But, then, neither are the good ones!<br />As other reviewers have noted, the packaging is misleading.  Like it's predecessor, Wizards of Odd, the stories as a whole do not live up to the hype on the covers.  There are, however, some fine tales to be had.  &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; by Mervyn Peake is evocative, although not in the least bit funny.  Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Harrison Bergeron,&quot; again singularly lacking in hilarity, is a worthy tale of a true egalitarian society.  &quot;The Roaches&quot; by Thomas M. Disch is eerily disgusting, and after reading it you will never look at cockroaches in the same way again.<br />Really, one can't help but wonder who is responsible for the packaging.	2002-03-01

West of Eden is such an incredible read that anything following it must, of necessity, fall short by comparison.<br />Return to Eden is by no means a bad book.  It is, like every Harrison work, an enjoyable read that holds the attention well.  Unfortunately, it accomplishes almost nothing.  When the book ends, all is pretty much the same as it was at the end of Winter in Eden.  Humans and Yilane continue to live separate lives, trying to avoid each other as much as possible.  There are hints early on in the book that we might be about to see a revolution in Yilane society, with the Daughters of Life on the verge of making a philosophical breakthrough and proselytizing male as well as female young (why else spend so much time showing how a male Yilane can develop into a mature individual if freed from the harem?).  But nothing comes of it, nor does anything of significance come from Kerrick's resolution to break with his Yilane past.  Return to Eden is a pleasant read, but anyone looking to experience the magic of West of Eden will be disappointed.	2002-02-21

And, typically Trek, the resolution is too pat to be credited.  Vornholt asks us to accept that the human colonists should &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; toward the feral Klingons who had brutally murdered their friends and family - with no apparent justification.  (At no time are we told of anything the colonists did to trigger the attacks, other than simply being there.)<br />However, as he did with Contamination, Vornholt spins a good yarn, staying true to the characters, even making Ensign Ro somewhat likeable (a major feat in and of itself).

Luceno puts in a fine effort, but Cloak of Deception does not live up to the standard he set with his Agents of Chaos duology.  The fault does not lie in the plot at all.  On the contrary, Luceno does an excellent job of shedding light on the background to the Phantom Menace.  We are able to see Palpatine the master politician, seeming to support every Senatorial faction, gaining the respect and trust of the most powerful Senators.  Luceno also tells us just what the \\"taxation of outlying systems\\" - the causus belli in Phantom Menace - is all about.  And we learn just how those \\"baseless\\" rumors of Valorum's corruption began.  Those alone make Cloak of Deception worth any Star Wars fan's time.<br />Unfortunately, Cloak of Deception suffers from the same fault as Episode I itself.  We just don't care about any of the characters.  There was something inherently likeable about Luke, Han, and Leia in Episode IV; we felt for Luke when he lost Owen, Beru, and Ben.  We cheered when Han returned to help Luke destroy the Death Star.  And we felt euphoria when Leia presented medals to our heroes.  With Phantom Menace, however, there was too much of a distance between us and the characters.  It's hard to care for Padme, for example, when she herself is playing a role; we never get to see the *real* Padme.<br />Cloak of Deception suffers from the same problem.  Valorum is almost assassinated, and we don't care.  Qui-Gon defies the Jedi Council and we are not impressed.  Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter does a much better job of drawing us into the characters' lives.<br />For enlightenment into the plot of Phantom Menace, Cloak of Deception is a must read.  Casual fans, however, would do better to read Shadow Hunter or a Rogue Squadron book.	2002-02-21

II	Books	3	6	7	N	N	More What Was Than What Might Have Been	Any collection of essays by various writers is going to have its share of hits and misses, and What If 2 is no exception.  Some of the contributors dive head-first into the premise and wallow in it.  Others stick their toes in, decide it's too cold, and jump right back out.<br />Every essay is useful as a quick overview of historical events, many of which will be unfamiliar to the general reader except in broad outline.  For that alone, the book is worthwhile.  The counterfactual histories themselves, however, vary in quality from writer to writer.  The best is, perhaps, John Lukacs' tale of Teddy Roosevelt's third term; Lukacs writes as if, in fact, TR won in 1912, and chides his fellow historians for not asking what would have happened if Woodrow Wilson had won.  One of the weakest is Victor Davis Hanson's opening essay about Socrates: what if Socrates had been killed in battle before he met Plato?  Well, turns out we would never have heard of him - imagine that!<br />One of the most enjoyable aspects of What If 1 was its focus on events that truly could have turned out differently but for a single moment or decision.  The same cannot be said of most of the sequel's essays.  For example, Josiah Ober's counterfactual involving the triumph of Antony over Octavian; rather than mark Actium itself as the turning point, Ober goes back to Antony's Parthian campaign.  If Antony had defeated the Parthians, Ober posits, Octavian would have ultimately lost.  But how likely was an Antony victory over Parthia?  Not very.  By contrast, Charles I escaping the plague because he happened to leave London a week before it broke out is more intriguing; unfortunately, Theodore Rabb's counterfactual speculation is limited to a few paragraphs at the end.<br />Overall, as other reviewers have concluded, What If 2 is a mixed bag.  It does not entirely live up to its promise and premise, but it does not completely disappoint either.	2002-02-12

Most of today's sci-fi's writers go to great lengths to create and explain alien civilizations; not so in The Legion of Space.  The aliens are ugly and they want to kill us.  Period.<br />\\"A reader\\" has already accurately summed up the novel.  I will add only that The Legion of Space is an interesting read for its gender portrayals.  As one would expect from the 1930s, the male characters are all obsessed with how fragile and vulnerable the heroine is; they must do whatever they can to protect her and shelter her and the thought of her in danger or even uncomfortable fills them with chauvinistic horror.  Williamson allows the men to carry on this way throughout the book, all the while giving us a woman character who needs no protection whatsoever and saves the day herself.  No weeping in hysterics for this heroine; Leia-like she leads the escape from the alien fortress while the men hesitate.  She and she alone has the secret to the weapon of ultimate destruction, and she unhesitatingly builds it and deploys it.  Not bad for 1936, eh?	2002-02-04
US	44207108	R1X44TZ5NFVMJP	0380804522	107125035	The Guardship (The Brethren of the Coast #1) (Book 1)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Overpackaged but Serviceable	As always, never judge a book by its cover.  The cover art and the packaging suggest that this book is a work of literature, a monument to the times it depicts, both provocative and evocative.  And the endorsement from O'Brien (whom I haven't read) encourages the hope of a literary masterpiece.<br />Alas, The Guardship is none of these things.  It's a potboiler; nothing more, nothing less.  It is an entertaining if formulaic adventure story, with plenty of battles and sex.  The writing is pedestrian, which would not even be worth commenting on except for O'Brien's endorsement.  I found The Guardship to be a Saturday-matinee type book; fun to watch but not likely to make any significant impact.	2002-02-04

The authors are not perfect, of course (Oz is just a tad too loquacious, and one would have thought that Angel's soul would prevent him from brutally torturing humans), but they are awfully darn close.  Every time a character opens his or her mouth, you can truly hear his or her voice - be it Giles, Buffy, or Xander.<br />The book is every bit as enjoyable as an episode of Buffy, although the ending is not as powerful as some other reviewers have suggested.  The sacrifice the Scooby-gang makes for Buffy is, well, not terribly moving.  Compare it to Buffy baring her neck to Angel in the TV series; now *that* was a sacrifice.<br />If I enjoyed the book, why only three stars?  To me, a book that is entertaining and amusing but not profound, moving, provocative, or otherwise exceptional is a three-star book.  This is the kind of book one can read on the bus, on a plane, or on the beach.  Very enjoyable but not challenging.  A fine way to pass the time.	2002-01-30
US	44207108	R18CAT44MUOD5G	0671014633	267174946	War Dragons (Star Trek: The Captain's Table, Book 1)	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Surprisingly enjoyable	Twenty pages in, there were enough strikes against War Dragons that I doubted I would enjoy it.  The whole &quot;Captain's Table&quot; concept turns out to be misleading; there's no time warp that allows Kirk/Picard/Sisko/Janeway to tell stories to each other - even though a look at each cover strongly implies it.  The frame story involving the Captain's Table bar is weak and unconvincing.  Kirk's and Sulu's stories are told in voices that do not sound like Kirk or Sulu; nor are they told in ways we'd expect a story to be told at a bar.  Too much introspection, too much detail.<br />And yet War Dragons is one of the better Star Trek books out there.  The plot structure is intriguing.  Kirk's and Sulu's stories occur twenty years apart and are told in alternating chapters until they converge for the last third of the book.  Each story has plenty of suspense and action and, once one puts aside the frame story, are well-written.  There are excellent Trek moments, including a charming description of the beginning of Kirk &amp; Spock's working relationship, and a tasteful cameo by Tuvok.  Also interesting is the idea that Sulu pegged Chekov to be his first officer; Graf successfully explains Chekov's eventual return to the Enterprise.<br />Not great literature, of course, nor great science fiction (read Harry Harrison's West of Eden for a masterful treatment of reptilian cultures that speak with physical movement as well as verbal cues).  It is, however, very good Star Trek - amusing, entertaining, and satisfying.	2002-01-28

The story moves slowly, painfully slowly at times; it takes over 200 pages for any character to leave the city of Tear, for example.  Nor are all storylines created equal.  Rand's journey into the Aiel waste (with the exception of his visions of Aiel history) is both endless and tiring.  Min's adventures in Tar Valon are far more gripping, but receive minimal treatment.  Perrin's return to the Two Rivers, however, is the best we have seen from the entire series so far.  Every page with Perrin is read literally on the edge of the seat, eagerly turning each page.<br />It doesn't hurt that of all the main characters, Perrin is the most (and perhaps the only) likeable.  The others are too wrapped up in their own selves and generate no sympathy, especially Mat.  It is striking that the friendship that had been so close in The Eye of the World is now virtually non-existent.  Rand, Mat, and Egwene are together but seldom interact except to criticize or complain, and none of them care at all about what had happened to Perrin.  A disappointing turn, as the ability to form and hold deep friendships is often what separates the good guys from the bad.	2002-01-14
US	44207108	R32A1AVQFJ7MAN	0140440607	188361232	The Annals of Imperial Rome (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Yes, history *does* repeat itself.	While reading Tacitus' account of Nero's reign, I was struck by the uncanny resemblance to the Soviet Union under Stalin.  Both dictators were surrounded by sychophants.  Both engaged in indiscriminate elimination of both real and perceived opponents.  The would-be rivals fell all over each other in attempts to distance themselves from each other yet ultimately were killed - either by the government or at their own hand.<br />Yet, while Tacitus is not as unbiased as he claims, he nevertheless attempted to give balanced views.  Tiberius, his personal qualities aside, is shown to have been an effective emperor responding appropriately to various crises.  Even Nero is shown with some positive qualities, including his generosity after the great fire (and Tacitus reports the rumours of Nero's culpability as just that - rumours).  Claudius does not come off as inept as other reviewers have suggested; on the contrary, compared with Nero and Tiberius, Claudius comes across quite well, if &quot;whipped.&quot;<br />Grant's translation gives full flavor to the work.  Other translations of Tacitus are just plain awful; Grant's is both readable and enjoyable.  Grant's footnotes and appendices are helpful, as his use of Roman numerals to distinguish among the many characters.  While drier than Livy, Tacitus' Annals are absolutely worth reading by anyone with an interest in the period.	2002-01-02

Nobody should expect 24th century jurisprudence to be the same as that in the early 21st, but the &quot;courtroom drama&quot; of Contamination is a farce. Vornholt tries to excuse an apparent ignorance of the law by saying that Federation law is &quot;Solomon-like&quot; - simple and without mumbo-jumbo. Fair enough. But then he describes procedures that no rational law-maker would have tolerated:<br />1. Data as defense lawyer. Data represents the accused, even though once the trial is concluded he will have to testify as a victim against the accused for another (although related) crime. Any modern attorney who participated in such a conflict of interest would be disbarred. Well, okay, this is *Data*, so maybe we can forgive this. But not:<br />2. Worf as prosecutor. Where's the JAG corp when you need it? As lead investigator, Worf has no business acting as prosecutor; he is a fact witness and a lawyer may not act as both counsel and witness; he is supposed to be a disinterested advocate.<br />3. Compelling defendant to testify. One would have thought that the right to not be compelled to testify would be sacrosanct in the enlightened Federation, yet the judge twice calls the defendant to the stand, once at Worf's prompting. (Worf: I'd like to know where he got the phaser. Judge: Yeah, me, too. Take the stand!)<br />4. Wesley giving his opinion on the defendant's guilt. A witness is not, and should not be, allowed to opine on the ultimate issue in a case. That is for the fact-finder (judge or jury) alone. Wesley's opinion is completely irrelevant and would never have seen the light of day in a true courtroom (and not just because it's Wesley, either!). <br />And so on. In &quot;Measure of a Man&quot; we were told that Riker and Picard had to act as attorneys solely because there were none around; it was an emergency measure only. Here, we are given no such excuse. Modern Navy ships have a JAG officer on board; why doesn't the Enterprise?<br />And yet, despite all ofthat, I found Contamination to be an enjoyable read. Nothing gripping or moving, but a good read to help while away a few hours. Exactly what one should expect from a Star Trek novel.	2001-12-27
US	44207108	R6TFK1JFJ4H1L	0345405641	95741719	Breakthroughs	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Hmmmmm	Up until Breakthroughs, Turtledove's treatment of the Great War makes sense.  Despite the US/CSA rupture, events in Europe continued as they have in our timeline and an assassination in Sarajevo triggers global conflict.  The glimpses we were given of the European fronts showed that the war was carrying on much as we would expect.<br />In our history, the stalemate in the west broke only after the US began to supply the Allies with troops and material, in early 1918.  US support was critical to the Allied effort as Russia was out of the war and Germany was free to transfer forces from the East to the West.  In Turtedove's world, however, the Allied collapse comes *before* Russia's collapse.  How? Why?  And why is there no mention of the events in Russia?  Surely the rise of the Bolsheviks would resonate with Flora Hamburger. (And while we're at it, why wasn't Trotsky in New York when the war began as he was in our history?)<br />Unfortunately, I had so keenly been looking forward to the Bolshevik Revolution rekindling the socialist movement in the US/CSA that it's lack detracted greatly from the rest of the book.  Beyond that, Turtledove's insistence of following a dozen characters four pages at a time continues to be annoying, however each storyline is entertaining and at times moving.	2001-12-19

More and more, though, one has to wonder if Gordianus is truly deserving of his &quot;Finder&quot; title; he seems to never discover the truth except by accident or divine intervention!  Gordianus' forensic abilities aside, however, The Venus Throw is a highly enjoyable read, worth every penny.	2001-10-16

This is not &quot;Forever War.&quot;  It is not even up there with &quot;World Without End,&quot; another Haldeman Trek novel.  The failings of this book are several.  What at first seems like a neat adventure story - Kirk and the gang weaponless and stranded on a planet with large, canivorous beasts - becomes instead yet another occassion when a &quot;superior&quot; race feels the need to test humans (this time, fortunately, without Abraham Lincoln).

US	44207108	R1BL8ZADOZLI15	055324633X	421033301	Vulcan!: Star Trek	Books	3	6	9	N	N	Good enough	There's something about the old Bantam books such as Vulcan . . . .  It is often difficult to remember that they were written before the movies, before the spin-offs, even before VHS!  The Bantam readers did not have the luxury of popping in a tape or referring to endless reference books; they had to rely on memory or James Blish's adaptations to keep the feel of the characters.  It was a different world then, in the distant, dark '70s.<br />Because of the comparative dearth of material, the Bantam writers, it seems, were able to keep their novels focused and tight.  Vulcan is a fine example; the criticisms of it are valid, but overlook that the story is finely paced with little wasted space (compare that to almost any Voyager episode, which drag on and on and on . . . .) The underlying story - about shifting ion clouds and Romulan expansion - is contrived; but, then, that's true of most episodes, isn't it?<br />What is most enjoyable here is a chance to see different sides of McCoy and Spock, sides that have been lost through the years.  Here we see the McCoy of &quot;For the World is Hollow,&quot; or &quot;Shore Leave,&quot; where a chance to get the girl interferes with his professional judgment.  We also see Spock the pervert; pay attention to the first several episodes of Star Trek and you'll see that Spock was very much into sexual innuendo, with an occassional leer at Janice Rand.  As Spock grew (really, as Nimoy began to flesh him out)that aspect of Spock was lost; that Sky brings it back redounds to her credit, as it forces us to look at Spock in a different light.<br />A Star Trek is almost never going to be great literature, or even great science fiction.  We should expect a book that amuses and diverts, and Vulcan fits the bill.	2001-09-25
US	44207108	R3RJMBS156AB94	0671705490	534636270	Deep Domain (Star Trek, No 33)	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Uneven and unsatisfying	There is no doubt that Weinstein is a capable author; several of his other Trek books have been truly enjoyable. Deep Domain, however, suffers from several flaws, which are only occasionally overcome.<BR> First, there is the tendency toward preaching Weinstein's own eco-agenda. When an author adds a preface encouraging readers to send money to Greenpeace, red flags should always go up. In the event, the politicking is not as prevalent as feared, but it surfaces periodically and distracts greatly. (It is hard to focus on the page when one's eyes are rolling.)<BR> Second, Weinstein falls into some common pitfalls of Trek writers. A: his Chekov's personality bears almost no resemblance to the original's (has there ever been a decent portrayal of Chekov??). B: he expects readers to care about his creations (e.g., Lt. Mabry) as much as we care about the &quot;true&quot; Trek characters. That's just not going to happen, folks. Third, the ending is completely unconvincing, as other reviewers have noted. Putting aside that Generations showed us that Kirk actually left Starfleet before going to the Academy (there's no way Weinstein could have known that), Kirk's decision to leave the Enterprise is completely forced, as is Spock's decision to also go to the academy. And news of Chekov's impending transfer to the Reliant - a chance for a true, emotional moment - also falls flat.<BR> That being said, Deep Domain was, at times, diverting if never gripping. I suppose it is unfair to expect a Trek novel to be anything other than mindless entertainment, a distraction. Deep Domain was never painful to read, just never exciting.	2001-09-24

She is such a wonderful writer, her plots, her style . . . . everything is at such a high level that her readers have come to expect nothing less than perfection from her. Certainly, I expected perfection when I began to read Sagitarius Whorl. I didn't find perfection, but nor did I find any thing less than pure enjoyment.<BR>This book, and the series as a whole, has everything that makes science fiction worthwhile. An intriguing plot with many twists and turns, a compelling yet not entirely sympathetic hero, sex, violence, and a vision of a humanity that continues to grow, mature, and slowly begins to eschew greed for humaneness and concern for the common weal.<BR>In some ways, this series is more accessible than the Pliocene and Galactic milieu epics, but it is no less compelling. Highly recommended.	2001-09-20

A scan of the reviews submitted bears that out; it appears that those with great familiarity with Russian history pan the book, while those with passing knowledge rave about it.<br />I agree with all those who take exception to the title; this is more a biography of Kirov than it is a &quot;whodunnit?&quot;  Knight's treatment of Kirov's life and times is dry at times but adequate.  When she turns her attention to the murder itself, the book begins to take hold.  Knight lays out a great many facts, and shows what inferences can be drawn from those facts, and yet her leap from those inferences to her conclusion remains unsatisfying.  For example, she quotes Trotsky's initial reaction to the murder; Trotsky was of the view that Stalin did not order the killing, but would sure as heck take advantage of it.  Knight says Trotsky was wrong, but her arguments as to why are unconvincing.	2001-06-14

Where Vespasian falls flat, however, is in style and organization.  Levick eschews the narrative, and spurns a chronological approach to her subject.  She chooses instead a subject-oriented organization; not bad in and of itself (Michael Grant largely pulls that off in The Severans), but her dry style and over-attention to obscure details and constant quarrels with other scholars make the absence of a narrative approach nearly fatal.<br />Levick also buries any hint of her own voice or feelings.  Obviously, she must have a keen interest in Vespasian to have invested such a large amount of work in the book.  Yet none of her interest comes through.  Contrast that with historians such as Norwich, Tuchman, or Runciman - a passion for their subject shines through each of their works.  The best historians set out with the mindset, &quot;This is a fascinating era of history, and I'm going to show my readers why they should think so, too.&quot;  Levick seems to have other priorities.<br />Perhaps academics can appreciate Levick's work (and perhaps the Italian translation is more gripping); for the amateur, however, looking for an enjoyable, educational foray into Imperial Rome, Levick's Vespasian is best avoided.	2001-06-06

The heroes of the Rebellion - Mon Mothma, Leia Organa, Ackbar, and others - have been out of power for several years now, and those who have taken over are inept, corrupt, self-aggrandizing, quarrelsome . . . the very things that launched Palpatine into power in Episode I.  Borsk Feyla's fear of the Jedi is borne of a sense that the New Republic is spiralling out of control, and, if history truly does tend to repeat itself, someone strong in the Force - particular one already revered as a hero as Luke Skywalker is - could easily turn the situation to his own advantage.     Surely that is where the New Jedi Order is taking us - to a conflict over the very nature of the New Republic itself.  The Yuuzhan Vong are but a catalyst, revealing the weaknesses of the New Republic after the Empire had finally been defeated in a way nothing else had.<br />     As for Jedi Eclipse itself, Luceno does a fine job with the amount of space he had.  The criticisms that have been posted about abridged treatment of plots, the absence of favorite characters (Lando happens to be one of my favorites, and he's been AWOL for three books now!) are all fair ones.  Luceno does, however, live up to the legacy left by Timothy Zahn (which, unfortunately, has not been the case with every book) and delivers a fast-paced, engrossing story true to the Star Wars universe.  Overall, this duology - despite some shortcomings - deserves to rank up there with the original Thrawn trilogy and the Rogue Squadron series - the best the expanded universe has had to offer so far.	2001-05-29

Assassin makes up for a glaring defect in its predecessor by focusing on one planet and having one character tie each story together; on the other hand, the Berserkers themselves leave little impression with the reader, the sense of menace from the first book is absent.      While there is little negative to be said about the book (except, as another reviewer has noted, a blatent and disappointing chauvinistic remark near the end), there is little positive, either.  It is competently written and holds the attention, but it is not likely to bring one hurrying back for a second read.	2001-05-24

Its biggest failing is that it follows West of Eden - an incredible novel in all respects.  Winter in Eden, while worth reading, seems undeveloped, less focused.
