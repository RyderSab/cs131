What will happen when Kostos comes to America to visit? (I have to say I was thoroughly disgusted with Kostos and I hated the end of his and Lena's relationship)<br />Carmen has to deal with the fact that her mother is now dating again and this sets forth major jealous vibes on Carmen's part. (Carmen was a little biotch through the whole book. I couldn't believe the way she treated her mother and Porter.

She also learns more about the person she wants to be.<br />We also see the return of old faces and the arrival of new ones. This book to me wasn't as good as the first.

Italian kid with the motorcycle, tattoo(an eagle on his forearm), and leather jacket. He's your typical bad boy, all his friends care about are babes, booze, and sex, and Ricky's quite experienced in all three.

They become sorta friends because they have a common complaint in each of they're families: there is going to be a new addition, a baby. And it goes on from there. Over time Ricky starts to like Joely, while Joely has liked him from the beginning. So Ricky asks Joely on a date.
