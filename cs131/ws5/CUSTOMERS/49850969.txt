The book is excellent, although if you are a true techno-geek it will be pedestrian from a technical sense.  However, for the novice it is a great overview on the history of search engines and the power they are just starting to demonstrate.  I found the history of all the various engineers and technology overlaid against the backdrop of luck, economics and timing, to be a fascinating glimpse into the reality that the best technology is not usually what makes the most money.<br /><br />At the core of the book though is the concept of what a search engine can do.  Obviously there are as many possibilities to develop and implement search algorithms as there are creative people to invent them (Microsoft MSN, Yahoo and others have products that compete directly with, and in many cases outperform the more well known brand the book focuses on), but essentially they have the power to pull together unbelievable amounts of formerly disconnected data, and create a targeted marketing aimed at you personally.<br /><br />The potential danger of all of this technology is that depending on how you set the algorithm, you no longer simply search reality, but actually create it.  For example, a change in how the search engine works can drive business to some on line retailers while destroying the business of others.  It can conceivably literally create trends, and promote views, all through the seemingly blind eye of the program.  The problem is that these programs are anything but blind, and we are on the verge of tremendous legal battles due to the creativity of those trying to use the system to deflect traffic from the owner of a trademark, to their own competing brand, with full compliance by the folks at Google.<br /><br />Overall, this book is an excellent way for the novice to understand this phenomenon a little better, and be more aware of how our world is changing.  Sure, there are valid literary criticisms of the book, and the author is biased towards (seems enamored with) Google, but it is a very interesting book that is informative, and certainly not dull.

I have heard some very good reviews on this book and how powerful her journalistic work is.  Therefore, I had some really high expectations.<br /><br />Here are the highlights.  The book is very well written.  Barbara writes in a style that brings to life her subject matter, and keep you engaged throughout.  Even when she pontificates on a tangent, it is well articulated.  Additionally the descriptions of the day to day work involved at the \\"entry level\\" was also well done.  I have worked many of those jobs in my life and found her depictions to be realistic concerning the difficulty of the physical work as well as the learning skills required to be proficient.  Many of these people are in fact quite capable and work day in day out without much recognition for their efforts.  On this point she really nailed it.<br /><br />While it is well written, and I believe well intentioned, overall the book is typical of the ideological views of the far Left, for which the author is a card carrying member.  Therefore, there are absolutely no solutions presented anywhere in this book about the plight of those trying to make a living working entry level roles.  Hard to believe really given the premise.  You would think she would at least offer up something.<br /><br />While \\"undercover\\" the author herself fails to even attempt to improve her voluntary plight by taking advantage of her intelligence to make better decisions and having some patience.  Moving three times to \\"try poverty\\" in three different places, is hardly the actions that would elevate someone out of poverty.  Further she seems to have fewer coping skills and less maturity than the \\"subjects\\" she is supposedly writing on.  We watch her principles and values erode as she gets tired.  We listen to her attempts to start union activity at a Wal-Mart even though she admits that it is not a panacea (In fact it would do more harm than good to those who would organize).<br /><br />In short, while I fully support her attempt to bring a view of those who work hard every day only to fall farther behind, in this book her approach, logic and conclusions are far too flawed to have the kind of impact I wish she would have had.d to those who would organize). <br /> <br />In short, while I fully support her attempt to bring a view of those who work hard every day only to fall farther behind, in this book her approach, logic and conclusions are far too flawed to have the kind of impact I wish she would have had. <br />	2005-09-10

I expected the book to be about how \\"white collar\\" employees were laid off, or how they struggle to make ends meet despite their comfortable salaries.  The book rather describes how author Barbara Ehrenreich takes on the challenge to get hired into corporate America and experience \\"white collar\\" work for herself.<br /><br />The majority of the book is about her experiences working with different \\"career coaches\\" and \\"networking groups\\" and other assorted entrepreneurs who work to help laid off middle managers get re-employed.  As she works to craft the right resume, pretending to be a PR executive, she describes what it was like to work with others who were also trying to find work.<br /><br />I did find the descriptions of the various personality tests, and the cheesy coaching tactics she engaged to help her to be fascinating.  In the end the book is as much about the whole sub industry that has developed to try and get middle managers re-employed after being downsized or laid off from their companies as it is about any sort of \\"American Dream\\".  The tactics and descriptions certainly do not put these \\"coaches\\" in a very positive light.  Throughout she makes overgeneralizations, and makes fun of people with religious beliefs and values, which detracts from her point considerably.<br /><br />The overall effect though is indeed chilling.  What she described about those people looking for work for sometimes months on end was more than just depressing; it was a hopelessness bordering on desperation.  This aspect of the book is quite powerful.  The depression, loss of confidence and sheer volume of silence that greeted her in her \\"job search\\" illuminates the human psychological casualties brought on by what is described throughout; corporations being faceless, cold entities discarding people at will.<br /><br />While there are holes in this book and the premise itself big enough to drive trucks through, Barbara really nails it when she gets to understand the emotional toll she feels as she faces rejection over and over.<br /><br />The book is written exceptionally well, is quite funny, and despite her rather obvious political biases which undermine her subject matter credibility at every turn, it is well worth reading.  In fact I think every corporate executive who has a role in determining the fate of middle managers should read this book if for no other reason than getting a first hand glimpse at the impact of their decisions.<br /><br />This is in no way a light book, it is dark, depressing and ultimately offers no solutions to the problems it outlines.  Despite that and despite my misgivings about the flaws and the biases of the author, I do recommend this book highly.  It will change the way you look at resumes and the people you interview.understand the emotional toll she feels as she faces rejection over and over.

I cried at the news, and at the same time felt odd about doing so. I never met Walter Payton. However, I followed his career, game by game for 13 years, and those years represented most of my young adult life. I always admired his tenacity, his sheer determination, and his unsurpassed skill on the football field. Every single play was a joy to watch. No one before or since played with that level of intensity on every down, every game. But what was even more impressive than that was his approach to life.<br /><br />When Walter break the NFL all-time rushing record, he said \\"this is for all of those who tried and didn't make it\\". Even more amazing in this era of spoiled athletes was that Walter meant those words, and lived them. Greatness and humility are a rare combination in professional sports. What we see throughout this book, in his own words and those by others, is that in spite of all his records and his success, he got up every day and gave it his all.<br /><br />The book itself covers his childhood in rural Mississippi through his professional career and to his early death due to liver cancer. The book is not written in the first person, which is disappointing, but understood in that it was written after he died. It is a series of paragraphs and reflections by different people who knew him, and by Walter himself.<br /><br />I recommend buying and reading this book. You will see a person who was truly the best football player of all-time, and at the same time was everything you would want a man to be - a caring father, loving husband since he was 20, a humble teammate and some one who never, ever quit and had a work ethic most can only dream of. A look at some great life lessons and awesome principles to live by.  I am still inspired by his approach.s approach. <br />	2005-09-02

Seriously.  Some of his bits are actually quite funny.  However, here is another \\"new rule\\"; No more book titles that are the opposite of what the book is.  \\"Timid observations\\"?  Hardly.<br /><br />Bill lost it somewhere around the 2000 election and became a shill for the liberal left, although how or why is still a mystery.  When he isn't trying to attack a political party he disagrees with, or trying to be the poor man's version of Howard Stern, he is actually quite funny.  Like Seinfeld he has the knack for making insightful observations about everyday life.<br /><br />He resorts to some bottom level humor here, seems to have some personal issues to deal with, and is consumed by his bitterness over his political party getting crushed last year.  Let it go already, life goes on.<br /><br />My recommendation to him; forget the political commentary and start being a normal comedian again, at least he has some talent there.  My recommendation for you; instead of buying this book, simply stand in the bookstore, or grab a cart full of free samples at Costco this Saturday and camp out for 20 minutes and read it.  It takes about that long.	2005-08-25

Gary does a wonderful job re-creating the evening and illuminating the racial overtones, the struggling NBA which was a far cry from the wealthy and glitzy league of today, and the fact that this historic game was not televised and only a few thousand fans were in attendance in Hershey, PA, which was not even the home court for either team.<br /><br />The book meanders through the game one quarter at a time.  Often reflecting back and providing the backdrop on Chamberlain, and the other players, and even provides glimpses into the lives of many of the fans who were there to witness the historic night.  At times the book was perhaps a bit too nostalgic, and some of the time spent on various people not really related to the game were a bit superfluous.<br /><br />It is really hard imagine several key issues depicted here.  First the racial situation encountered by the players is difficult to read and not feel emotionally angered at the treatment many of the minority players experienced.  The fact that a player could actually score 100 points in a single game is beyond remarkable.  In today's NBA most teams do not score 100 points.  Consider that Wilt Chamberlain averaged over 50 points a game for the entire season, and these are records which will never be broken.<br /><br />The book is engaging, and well written.  Although perhaps too broad in its scope, it does create the backdrop for the historic night well.  Even if you are only a casual fan of the game, the historical and sociological content alone is worth the read.	2005-08-07

That's fair I suppose given his views about liberal ideology in the media.  However, this book is far more about a social commentary on those whose views undermine the core beliefs, and social values and decency our nation was founded on.  Goldberg takes on those on both sides of the political fence, but in general keeps his prose to issues that effect the everyday social fabric of America.<br /><br />I actually really enjoyed reading his rants.  Granted, some of them I disagree with, but generally he seems to really have issue with how a few misguided people have damaged the values the rest of us hold.  If I were to summarize what you can expect, it would be this:  If you support the rights of a criminal over the victim or glorify the behaviors of people who in any decent society deserve to be behind bars, you will get slammed in this book.  If you got your fame and money through acting or music and attempt to be taken seriously as a political commentator, you will be taken to task here.  If you support the sexualization of children, or support the boorish sexual antics of the fringe of society (ala Will and Grace glorifying adultery), you will find yourself on the list.<br /><br />This book is after all a social commentary on the values of America, and the few who are trying to create a society that stands for nothing, allows and glorifies anything, and permits everything no matter how inappropriate.  Take for example the so called \\"environmentalists\\" who attack others for driving big SUV's while they fly Gulf Stream jets and live in houses that use more energy than several small towns.  Hypocritical is merely an obvious label for such people, but they deserve far more criticism than that.  Goldberg exposes them here.<br /><br />It should be noted, and isn't on any critical reviews I have read here, that Goldberg is not trying to silence such voices.  He stands up for the rights of everyone to free speech.  He takes on people whose views would be way right politically, and does so with gusto.  So, the book is far more balanced that way than others here may be giving credit for.<br /><br />Overall, a very good look at some of the erosion of values, morals and common decency in our society, and the few people who are trying to do the most damage.  At times it is too sensational, at times a bit shrill, and of course is just one person's opinion.  That said, he is far more often than not absolutely accurate in his assessment and its time more people woke up and started speaking out against such views.not trying to silence such voices.

US	49850969	RP66I2DT9H3PB	0375414576	786383328	My Life	Books	4	7	13	N	N	Very detailed and insightful, but could have been deeper	I picked up this book to read as I wanted to get President Clinton's perspective on his political career, and that is exactly what this book is.  \\"My Life\\" is indeed the vantage point we receive throughout.  That said, I was amazed at how detailed the book is. While it does not cover every single day of his 8 years in the White House, it certainly seems like it does.<br /><br />For me the highlights were the sections where he was introspective about his relationships with people, or about his own personal struggles.  While it was unfortunate he glossed over and never really addressed his countless alleged sexual escapades prior to Monica, he also never states that Monica was his first extra-marital fling either.  This is classic Clinton, saying only what he has to.<br /><br />As it pertained to the infamous Monica story, I was impressed with his honesty about how he compartmentalizes his life, and failed on the personal side.  He also is quite up front about \\"sleeping on the couch\\" after coming clean with his family, yet he never divulges what those conversations entailed.  While certainly not the most important aspect of his term in office, the Lewinsky scandal was the most reported and contained some glaring mistakes, so I expected he would have to address it, and did so adequately here in my opinion.  It is also important to note how he recounts that one of the best chances we had at getting Osama occurred while he was trying to make up with his wife for cheating and then lying about it.  Sad that history may have been changed had he only been honorable in his personal life and been able to be a more focused leader on that important task.<br /><br />Overall, the book is not written particularly well.  It often reads like a recounting of events and a description in the third person. Every now and then we get a glimpse inside the man, and it is too bad these were not more frequent.  While I seldom agreed with his politics, and never with his wife, I respect him as a person, and give him credit for at least telling his side of the story.  Not a spectacular book, but certainly interesting enough to warrant reading it.  I would recommend this book to anyone on either side of the political fence, as it does reflect the person behind the politics fairly well.him as a person, and give him credit for at least telling his side of the story.

On this end, Hugh does a credible job in illuminating how important and trusted these information sources have become in the recent few years.<br /><br />The book is the strongest when Hugh is outlining some of the well documented failing of the tradition media, in particular the sad and unfortunate tarnish to Dan Rather for whom what little objectivity he ever had was destroyed by his foolishly supporting a news story based on forged documents.  In this aspect, as well as the failed exit polling in the last Presidential election, the \\"blogs\\" had the accurate data and talk radio personalities like Hugh let the public know about it.  It is true that the world has changed and people in general no longer trust the far left leaning main stream media.<br /><br />I also learned about a number of great blog sites, and plan on checking those out.  For that alone, the book was also useful.<br /><br />However, I cannot give the book high marks overall because it was not written well.  The chapters and themes are disjointed and disconnected, Hugh at times seems to launch into nothing more than personal grandstanding, and his technical data points were a bit weak.<br /><br />This would have been a fabulous article somewhere, but it feels like it got stretched into a book for nothing more than a few more bucks in his pocket.  Good points, poor presentation.  Overall, there was enough to keep me interested, but I can't give the book a high recommendation, despite more often than not agreeing with his viewpoints.	2005-07-17

This is one amazing story.  After reading it I felt like I needed to take a shower. Rarely have I ever \\"experienced\\" such complete disregard for values and integrity.  To be fair, the author left out one important group of people who are also to blame for this debacle: us.  In the epilogue the author chronicles the legal resolutions against the various players in this scandal, but fails to mention that anyone who thought in their head \\"I could get rich quick off this company\\" was also at fault in creating the culture that allowed this to happen.<br /><br />The book is very detailed.  The financial maneuverings, and accounting sleights of hand are described as well as they ever will be in all likelihood.  What makes the book however, is the moral implications and shocking insights into how many people got it so wrong.<br /><br />The \\"smartest guys in the room\\" refers to the arrogant culture that became the demise of Enron's credibility and ethics. Enron was famous for hiring people, usually MBA's and other young inexperienced people from places like McKinsey, who came to feel themselves above the law. With a total disregard for others, or other companies, they simply became unable to have any self critical humility and felt they could do no wrong.  I can easily believe how the culture there gave rise to the biggest excess and fastest demise of any company in industrial history.<br /><br />The excess of the senior people at Enron, is something out of Roman Caesar lore, and is hard to believe occurring in a public company where shareholder values are supposed to mean something.  Kenneth Lay, the CEO, had his own children use the company jets (Page 90) like others use taxis.  Lay used Enron like his own personal wealth, abusing it and the shareholders in the process. Several executives later commented that \\"the money went to their heads\\" (Page 123), and they quickly became to feel they deserved it.  The antics of these executives simply have to be read to be believed.  While investors, shareholders, and employees lost everything they had put into the company, many of the people responsible directly for those losses took out countless millions for themselves.<br /><br />The authors admit it is hard, if not impossible, to understand exactly when Enron crossed the line.  What is known is that they did so clearly to a level rarely seen, and further for all their supposed intelligence on how to bend and break the rules, never really seemed to understand where it would lead them. (Page 143).<br /><br />In the end, the desperation to prop it up every quarter took on a life of its own, but by then the rationalization that exists whenever anyone fails to reign in the cognitive dissonance created by an accumulation of actions that lead the person well past any point a direct decision would have lead them to, simply created a situation wherein they failed to see themselves critically at all.<br /><br />While it is easy to point out that Skilling, Fastow, and Lay are the easy targets here, there were so many who bought in and supported the fraud out of greed and learned ignorance, that in the end the book simply reflects the logical progression point brought about by arrogance, greed and ego and a culture that reinforced itself.  After reading this book I see this as obviously a huge failing for many people individually, but more than that a failing of humanity.  If any of us thought about buying Enron stock to \\"get rich quick\\" we are part of the problem.  Enron just took that problem to its most self centered and greed based conclusion.<br /><br />Overall, a truly fantastic book.  Disturbing, and difficult to read. Like other horrific acts throughout history, when the truth reveals the perpetrators as failed people and not evil monsters, we are more horrified to find they are not monsters than if they were, and are left to wonder how it could have possibly all gotten so wrong.reholders, and employees lost everything they had put into the company, many of the people responsible directly for those losses took out countless millions for themselves.

His basic premise is that in order for work to be \\"fun\\" the employee must have the ability to be engaged in making important decisions.  Therefore, he sought to knock down the usual hierarchy and structure that exists, cut out many middle management roles, and engage his people at all levels in being part of the \\"fun\\".<br /><br />On this I would completely agree.  There is no question that engagement, meaningful work, job satisfaction and performance are correlated.  I found his approach so radical that even though I consider myself very progressive in how business and organizational dynamics exist, and how they may be improved to engage people, I was left feeling a bit rigid in my thinking in comparison.  Whenever a book poses ideas so radical they make me re-examine my own biases and operating principles, that is a very good thing.<br /><br />However, it should also be noted that to be quite honest about it, it didn't work.  The company did not exceed all expectations indefinitely, and Dennis himself was asked out.  I think a closer look will show some inherent flaws in the execution of his philosophy.<br /><br />First, Dennis assumes that all employees desire the accountability and responsibility for the bigger picture.  His depicts an approach that is male-centric and focuses on a western culture of \\"winning a game\\" that may not fit for many employees; therefore requiring them to do that role may be counter productive.<br /><br />Second, a culture that expects all employees to make difficult and strategic leadership decisions requires a huge effort on costly employee development and training.  The skills required to make strategic long range decisions, balancing capital, people, and execution are not widely held.  Expecting someone to want to step up and make the decision themselves is not enough, they must have the skills to do it effectively and this requires an organization to develop them in its employee base.  There was little discussion of how his company did this.  Contrast this with GE's focus on leadership development for example.<br /><br />Third, there is a reason that most compensation systems reward leadership positions more highly.  The resulting accountability, stress and responsibility warrant the additional compensation.  In the model Bakke describes, he seems to want to maintain his leadership compensation, while at the same time expecting his employees to take on the hard work that goes along with it.  This is also has the potential to cause distractions if not managed carefully.<br /><br />Overall, I loved the book and embrace the core essence of what he is trying to say.  If taken in context of the potential issues in execution, I would say that it is a very sound way to operate a business and will likely pay off in higher employee engagement and performance.ves is not enough, they must have the skills to do it effectively and this requires an organization to develop them in its employee base.

There are countless examples provided, and while some are seemingly harmless ramblings of lost souls trying to gain glory, others depict a more savage and harmful intent.<br /><br />First, my criticisms of the book are as follows.  I felt the author could have improved his prose greatly by including his source material more readily in the text.  While well documented in the back, the book reads too much like an essay, and less like the researched prose it is intended to be.  Second, there were several examples in the book that were stretches at best.  He would have been better off taking a half dozen of his points and expounding in more detail than filling in with examples not as relevant or as strong.<br /><br />That said, the book is quite strong.  Jack spends the first few chapters delving into the origins of \\"progressive\\" thought.  There are several stories of well documented frauds that were trotted out to serve political interests.  Of the most alarming is the work of one Walter Duranty who falsified the horrors of Stalin and legitimized the Soviet Union in the West. (Page 32).  This gave rise to many of the liberals that still sympathize with Castro today for example, for much of the same reasons.  Of course these lies come out in time, yet surprisingly as the book depicts, they are ignored by the cultural elite who continue to trot out time and time again philosophical \\"truths\\" long since exposed as frauds.  The exploits of John Kerry (Page 91) who falsely staged his own Viet Nam \\"protests\\" in the 1970's for political gain only to have the truth hurt him 30 years later in his run for the Presidency, shows that this tactic is alive and well in the academic and left elite.<br /><br />There are simply too many examples of these frauds and deliberate deceptions to count, but here are a few highlights:<br /><br />A movement by some leftist academia to try and give Africa claim to the intellectual powers of the Greeks rested on the supposed plunder by Aristotle of an Egyptian library built \\"25 years after he died\\" (Page 108);<br /><br />Ward Churchill of the University of Colorado comically claims to be a Native American (which he isn't) and fabricates stories which have been totally shown to be false. One for example, was about US Soldiers deliberately giving the Native Americans smallpox (Page 139), which has no basis in any facts at all.  In a move which simply captures the academia mindset, CU makes him the Chairmen of their Ethics Committee!;<br /><br />The acclaimed work of Rigoberta Menchu, her supposed autobiography:  \\"I, Rigoberta Menchu: An Indian Woman in Guatemala\\", is shown to be totally fabricated, yet the cultural elite ignore the facts, and \\"The Chronicle of Higher Education\\" even states: \\"It doesn't matter if the facts in the book are wrong\\" (Page 147) and allow it retain its heralded status as non-fiction and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize!<br /><br />The origins of Planned Parenthood are nothing less than eugenics and racism.  Margaret Sanger, the founder of the group was famous for her work \\"The Pivot of Civilization\\" written in 1922, in which she based the organizations foundation on; \\"the most urgent problem today is how to limit and discourage the over-fertility of the mentally and physically defective\\". (Page 222)  As hard to believe as this is, it gets far worse than this.  Remember this when you hear the shrill marketing slogans about \\"choice\\".<br /><br />The sections on the personal habits and pedophile supporting Alfred Kinsley are too horrific to print here.  Yet this hasn't stopped Hollywood from depicting him sympathetically.  So desperate for a justification of their lifestyle, the obvious lack of reliability of his methods and the illegal activities he fostered and encouraged towards abusing children, are left ignored.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fascinating look behind the scenes of so many well documented frauds which continue to be propagated even today.  The book is well written and interesting, but has its flaws as I noted.  You will never view the academia and cultural elite of the left the same way again after reading though, so if the truth doesn't matter to you, then skip this book.l activities he fostered and encouraged towards abusing children, are left ignored. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a fascinating look behind the scenes of so many well documented frauds which continue to be propagated even today.

This book is no exception.  The fact that it is also a study guide is even more effective in delivering the message while directing the reader to several key questions to consider in each section.<br /><br />One of the best aspects of the book are the hundreds of quotes and essays, all around the central theme of the importance of character.  While our culture often acts to create an \\"end justifies the means\\" behavioral set, never before has character been so important, or so difficult to really practice and live.<br /><br />The book begins with some essays from famous leaders; from Plato to George Washington, Winston Churchill to Machiavelli, and compares and contrasts what each felt about the importance of character, and how it was to be demonstrated.  Much of the material is pretty well known, yet the ability to so easily read and discuss different styles and approaches is well worth the effort.<br /><br />My favorite sections were on the \\"Cultural Erosions of Character\\" in which the many examples of how society pushes and changes the definition and meaning in life impacts what we define as important at all.  From advertising, to media, the pressure to conform is greater than ever, but in some ways has always existed.<br /><br />One of the best essay's in my opinion is called the \\"Revenge of Failure\\" wherein Henry Fairlie rips the \\"legend of our times\\", as envy at its worst.  No longer content to envy what others have and we do not, we now attempt to destroy in others that which we cannot achieve ourselves.  This process degrades talent and is a poor attempt to \\"buy\\" our way into importance not through the achievement of something remarkable, but through the tearing down of the remarkable achievement into something attainable.  Thus character becomes something that is no longer \\"earned\\".<br /><br />The sections on plastic surgery and other shifts into a looks based culture further erode the importance of character.  In this relentless and obsessed pursuit of the elusive perfection, the hunter becomes the hunted, and always loses in the battle to fight against aging and the myth of happiness in ones physical appearance.  Powerful depictions of how this societal pressure has claimed far too many who sacrifice character for fleeting and shallow appearance, are depicted with a convicting clarity.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very well done and thought provoking book.  As a study guide it would be ideal for small groups, or even personal reflections.  The book is so full of quotes and essays that it can be read at once, or in dozens of small bites with equal effectiveness.  Highly recommended.no longer \\"earned\\". <br /> <br />The sections on plastic surgery and other shifts into a looks based culture further erode the importance of character.

As such, there are ways to avoid defensiveness, stay in control, and win over even the toughest of critics.<br /><br />I was not expecting the brilliance of the book, quite frankly.  I read a lot and \\"self-help\\" type books on speaking and communications and they tend to start blurring together, so I was pleasantly surprised to be so captivated and helped by this one.  The book is easy to read and explores dozens of techniques on how to really listen to the true meaning behind the questions, how to rephrase, of create buffers which give you time to think, how to use various other methodologies to always stay in control.  All of these were very well written and especially well illustrated with examples, both of the skills being done well, and not so well.  The result is a remarkable clarity on how to improve.<br /><br />Some of the highlights for me were the sections on avoiding negative wording, and defensiveness.  The classic blunders of many politicians were used as examples of how not to respond so we see that even the most seasoned and experienced can make mistakes. I found myself many times wincing through a sense of self criticism of my own past responses, which often unfortunately had the same poor results as those depicted here.  Every time, there were excellent examples of how small changes in approach or wording could make a huge difference in the result. I walked away from a short read with some really powerful mindset shifts on the subject.<br /><br />Overall, the book is truly a gem.  I cannot think of anyone who ever presents to groups, or engages in public speaking and faces Q & A's and other types of verbal interactions that would not be greatly influenced by these simple training techniques.  While at times the author seems obviously biased politically, he does a credible job in the end of trying to show positive and negative examples on both sides of the political fence.  Highly recommended, and a must for executives and all leaders engaged in the practice of public speaking.es the author seems obviously biased politically, he does a credible job in the end of trying to show positive and negative examples on both sides of the political fence.

The first few pages grabbed me and kept me riveted to the story.<br /><br />The book is quite simply put - amazing. I don't necessarily mean that in a good way though. It is basically the story of a lower level employee at Enron, who describes in intimate detail the soap opera saga within the employee ranks at Enron during the high growth and fast fall of the company.<br /><br />The highlights include the fact that the book is well written. The author has a flair for the dramatic which plays out on nearly every page. Her descriptions of others physical appearance, interpersonal styles and even body odor are comical. The book also captures the \\"feeling\\" many employees have when working in a fast paced and hectic corporate environment. She captures the gossip, paranoia, back stabbing and depictions of perhaps the worst office politics of all time in action, with an alarming clarity. This is no \\"Dilbert\\" anecdote, but rather a bizarre \\"Lord of the Flies do Corporate America\\".<br /><br />However, despite that fact that it is eminently readable, there are some major holes here. First, the title is totally misleading. She was in no way an \\"executive\\" or even  anything close to it. Second, if even half of this is true, she has described the worst work culture in history. The mafia has better values than how she depicts Enron. How in the world does she have all this information? She describes taking documents, hundreds of them, from her company. In addition to her own theft and violation of basic principles and responsibilities of being an employee, she was a malingerer, often focused far more on the gossip than her work.  Her attempts to appear to be a victim of this organization fail miserably.  More likely, she was part of the problem herself.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that if you like intrigue and can suspend your disbelief; this book makes for a fascinating look at the worst of corporate politics. No one and I mean no one, comes out of this book looking even close to being an honorable or intelligent or even a decent person. It is indeed written well, her prose is often hilarious, and the book flies by. As for being a credible look inside Enron? If that is what you seek, look elsewhere.this book makes for a fascinating look at the worst of corporate politics.

One can think of dozens of appropriate titles, including \\"Correlations you never thought of\\", or \\"Why your common sense isn't statistically valid\\", and the like.  Generally speaking that is what this book is, a jumbled collection of topics, which are analyzed with statistical processes to form conclusions.  From the true impact of parents, the cause of violent crime reduction, how your name makes a difference, and how Sumo wrestlers and teachers both cheat, the topics really are quite varied.<br /><br />I really liked the way he tackles some of these topics.  The format is easy to follow; he postulates a hypothesis, gives some general background and then attacks it with data and statistics that counter common myths.  For example, the sections on Sumo wrestlers and school teachers demonstrates that those in position to do so, often find ways to adapt to a new system and cheat to improve their lot.  It seems that Sumo wrestlers have a reciprocal system that only deep data analysis uncovers.  The teachers were a bit easier to catch.  Data analysis on scholastic exams shows they did more than \\"teach\\" to improve scores.<br /><br />Likewise the section on how the name you pick for your child does influence the future success of that child is fascinating, as is the analysis of how names come in and out of popularity.<br /><br />However, in several sections the book is less than complete, or simply wrong.  From a good taste perspective, inserting quotes about oneself between every chapter seemed a tad ego-centric.  That is just a style issue.  In other sections the miss is a bit more pronounced.<br /><br />Levitt postulates that the reason we have seen a decrease in violent crimes is due to legalized abortion, not any of the other factors often credited.  His reasoning is that when \\"unwanted\\" babies are killed through this process, it eliminates future criminals.  While he is quick to point out that he is not justifying the practice on this account, what are missing are some other facts.  Namely that the highest percentages of violent crimes are committed by economically disadvantaged minorities, and statistically abortions are disproportionally practiced by the same group. Thus his reasoning about \\"unwanted\\" is spurious and rather the effect seems to be simply lowering the high risk population.  Obviously this is likely the worst possible way to address a problem like this.<br /><br />In another section Levitt simply misses some rather obvious logic.  When using data to link the effect of stay at home mothers on school performance, he makes no distinction whatsoever between mothers who choose to stay home and those who do so for other reasons, like being unemployable.  There are countless examples like this where his own attempt at logically addressing the \\"hidden side\\" uses flawed premises, and misses key variance analysis that would likely result in different conclusions.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book; it is fun to read and interesting throughout.  I believe that the popularity of this book has more to do with a catchy cover and title and a pop culture like approachability, than any true depth of analysis or profound or groundbreaking conclusions. A great read regardless though, and a fun way to spend an airplane flight.nt, what are missing are some other facts.

The brand is one of the most recognized in the world, and countless millions use their products.  What is less known though is how the organization had to transform itself recently while never letting their collective foot off the gas.<br /><br />The first hundred pages or so start with the history of how Gates founded the company.  I felt the author didn't go into too much detail or attempt to write an autobiography, just provide enough background to set the stage for the changes to come.<br /><br />The catalyst according to the author is the DOJ lawsuit filed against Microsoft.  The impact on Gates is described as profound, and helped Bill and Steve Ballmer initiate some changes to a few company philosophies.<br /><br />There are a few themes that emerged for me when reading.  Among them are the facts that the company has a (rare) focus on never standing still.  Always concerned about being out innovated, or beat in the marketplace, the company has created a culture where employees and leadership are relentless about improving.  Another (rare) organizational trait is the focus on hiring talented people.  Only GE in my personal experience understood that hiring the smartest, and best, at all levels is critical to success.  Microsoft leaders are legendary for their unusual interviewing techniques, all designed to hire the brightest thinkers.<br /><br />While these traits made the company successful, according to the author they alone were not enough to take Microsoft forward after recent events.  One of the biggest changes was Bill Gates stepping out of the top role into a technology role, and Steve Ballmer taking on the CEO role.  This move may have been surprising from the outside, but it seems it allows both to do what they do best.  Further changes in focus were developed in two broad areas, values and customer focus.  Steve Ballmer sought to influence the talent inside Microsoft to better work together, be more respectful and self critical, and so on.  The book outlines a short list of these values.  The second area was an even stronger focus on customer orientation. These concepts are outlined in some detail.<br /><br />Overall, the book is an easy read, and was not in any way dry in my opinion.  The author does a credible job at portraying the events and outside influences that led to the \\"reboot\\" or transition that companies must go through as they grow.  For anyone interested in Microsoft, the book provides an interesting overview of the life cycle of an organization that has had a profound impact on the world.e Microsoft to better work together, be more respectful and self critical, and so on.

Like \\"jazz\\" this book doesn't really seem to have a concise point or direction, but rather he writes as though he is engaged in a long conversation about life.<br /><br />After a rocky start (the first chapter ends with \\"On to Chapter Two\\" - indeed) Donald waxes poetically with deep prose about how we as humanity prioritize what's really valued.  Using an analogy of a \\"lifeboat\\" he describes what it would be like to be not dependent on the absurdity of materialism, or ego, but rather on purpose, meaning and how we influence others.<br /><br />He then ventures into astute observations about how the bullet point, sound-bite means of communication reflects a whole new theology, as opposed to summarizing one.  The truth is far more difficult to break down into simple easy bites, and must be gleaned from the whole he postulates.  Throughout he relates deeply personal experiences, gives examples of emotional human interactions to illustrate his points, and is quite effective in doing so.<br /><br />At times I am left stunned by his observations, and how deeply profound they are.  At other times he seems to ramble in generalities about life with all the depth of a new age incense shop.  Yet, when all is said and done I still just don't quite know how to take him.  Is he really onto something?  Or is he on something?<br /><br />If you have an interest in spirituality, what Christianity is all about, or how to live your life to the fullest, should you read this book?  You know, I just don't know.  Suffice it to say that I was always engaged while reading, at times had a lump in my throat and at other times wanted to put the book down due to what I perceived as meaningless drivel.  So, if you are an adventurous sort who likes to think, then give it a go.  If you are looking for sound theology, or bullet points and short chapters along the likes of \\"Christianity for Dummies\\" then this is not what you want to read.

This book gives the reader an inside look at what is was like as the company was getting started.  This is important to note because most of these depictions are centered on the early days of the company, long before it became the large organization it is today.<br /><br />The book broken into chapters centered on each of the 19 people.  Each chapter introduces the particular individual and provides a bit of information on their background.  The individuals themselves have each written an essay on their time at the company, and particular insights they have.<br /><br />What is fascinating is that the perspectives are all different, and even though some common themes emerge, each person was impacted in a different way by their experiences.  As a result the essays themselves are a joy to read, and are more like a conversation or a series of relatable observations, than a detailed analysis.<br /><br />Some are quite funny.  One individual in particular had me laughing so hard with his dry humor than I nearly fell off the exercise equipment I was working on while reading.  Some are sad, some a bit bitter, and one or two actually seem to regard the experience as life changing in a much broader sense than merely a career.<br /><br />The most common theme is money, in particular how the stock options made them rich, or didn't.  It is profound to read about the impact this had on their lives.  Some seem grateful, others give a feeling of entitlement, and others seem genuinely haunted by what could have been.  So powerful was the wealth that was created, that most who did well discuss in equal balance the security and flexibility it gives them in their lives, and the isolation that is created with family and friends due to their wealth.  It seems most have some difficulty in reconciling the wealth they amassed with the correlated effort and career opportunity.<br /><br />Overall, while I'm sure the culture of the company is really not captured perfectly by any of them, the reader is nonetheless able to see some transcending themes emerge from all of the stories.  This is a fascinating book from a psychology standpoint, as well as a brief, but powerful, inside look into a legendary company culture.ficulty in reconciling the wealth they amassed with the correlated effort and career opportunity.   <br /> <br />Overall, while I'm sure the culture of the company is really not captured perfectly by any of them, the reader is nonetheless able to see some transcending themes emerge from all of the stories.

The topic of this book is how the big things in your life, your business, your relationships are really no more than a series of very small things.  The key to change is the ability to make the minute course corrections over time, not big changes all at once.<br /><br />The book starts with some great examples of how our mindset typically works when faced with major change or obstacles.  We freeze.  We are unable to grasp the enormity of what is required and therefore have less likelihood of success.  The strategy is then in breaking the situation down to smaller segments and executing them.  For example, anyone can exercise three minutes a day.  Now by itself this won't change your life, but what if three turns into ten, ten into twenty, twenty into thirty?  Now major change is underway.<br /><br />The other essential element to this approach is the ability to understand root causes.  This is a critical step in any Quality effort in business, but is also just as relevant and perhaps more important in life.  Start by asking small questions.  These will eventually lead to the root or core issues to be addressed.<br /><br />The other sections lead from these basic premises.  Take small actions, for example.  Once the problem or change desired is broken down into smaller segments, don't try to change all at once.  Take small steps and watch them grow.  I think a big reason this is so difficult to do, is that many of us hard charging type-A types lack the patience to allow change to happen through the one step at a time mindset, and want to rush it all at once.  We do so often with faster results that over time achieve less, and therefore in the end are in fact slower than if we were patient to begin with.<br /><br />I found this book to be very enlightening.  It presents wisdom that is common sense, yet rarely acted upon.  I have tried several of the techniques and found them to be very helpful.  I recommend this book highly.

What is compelling about the story is how accurately it depicts the \\"hamster-on-a-wheel\\" existence that plagues most executives.  I was personally drawn to the story as I too find myself at times trying to better balance my life.<br /><br />The story is really fantastic.  Doreen has done a wonderful job in capturing some deep emotions.  She just nails the \\"double-life\\" feeling that often accompanies the executive trying to balance between being the in charge leader in the office and the \\"real person\\" outside.  The depictions of the collisions between these worlds is exceptionally well done.<br /><br />When a tragedy strikes the lead character she is forced to step off the wheel so to speak, and this pause allows her to see a glimpse of the simpler life she once had, and could have again.  The book captures the longing for meaning and purpose, and emptiness of climbing the ladder, with remarkable insight.<br /><br />The story is written in a novel format, and there are areas that I would caution readers, especially men, on.  First, while I have never actually read one, the book at times seems to fit the caricature of what I imagine a \\"romance novel\\" would be like. So men be forewarned. The other issue is that some of the foul language seems a bit gratuitous, and although I imagine it's there to provide a dose of realism, I found some to be unnecessary.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this highly to anyone who enjoys reading quick novels, and has also struggled with trying to balance the demanding schedules and tempting payoffs of corporate America with the child inside of them that wants to really be alive again.	2005-05-28

That said, this book is not as deep nor profound as some of his other works, but because it is a book that is fun to read and hard to put down, I recommend it as the kind of light reading we like to enjoy in the summer months at the beach.<br /><br />The book starts with a couple out for a long trek in the wilderness, with the husband pushing his shy wife, who has a stuttering problem, out to strengthen and test her. The book never really explains how this wilderness trek is supposed to do this, but it's a believable premise anyway.  The two are attacked by creatures in the forest they think are bears, or perhaps \\"Bigfoot\\"?<br /><br />Now, when the book starts out by creating a situation about \\"Bigfoot\\" I was very unsure of where it would go.  Typical for Peretti though, all is not what it seems. The wife, \\"Beck\\", is captured by these creatures and the rest of the book centers on her rescue, as well as some discoveries of how these creatures came to be.<br /><br />The writing is good, not great, but as I mentioned it flows along and the story unfolds in a way that keeps you engaged.  There are some bigger issues tackled here, but not to the extent of his other work.  In fact, for those who may read the book for its \\"Christian\\" content, there just isn't much there.<br /><br />Overall, a good effort and a fun light read, although not up to his best work.	2005-05-26

The story follows a young woman who has the drive to get out of the small town, and abusive family life she is in.  It tracks the marriage of a yuppie family, where the husband's behavior puts him in a situation where he can lose it all - his marriage, his job and his freedom.  These paths will intersect in the most miraculous way.<br /><br />The author does a great job of weaving what seem like independent plot lines together.<br /><br />There are several story lines, but the main two include one which follows a crime syndicate and a terrorist plot, and the other follows the lives, failures and redemption of the two lead characters.<br /><br />The story is not only suspenseful but hits home.  The depiction of how the husband continues to find himself in situations he can't seem to resist depicts the cycle of addiction with chilling clarity.  The way that the little choices we make can lead to a place in life we couldn't have imagined we would find ourselves.  In this regard often novels are more adept at communicating a message that resonates by creating situations that people can relate to and thus become more open to the message itself.  This book is great in that regard.<br /><br />Overall, I very much enjoyed the story, despite the fact that the ending is miraculous and at times a bit too convenient.  The reader will discover a powerful message and a book that hooks you into the action and is hard to put down.  Everything you expect from a good novel.	2005-05-13

The book starts with some key points:  Simplicity - the art of making the complex clear - can give us the power to get things done.  This can be accomplished in a couple of different ways; Use time differently, and work backwards from what people (those employees closest to the customer) want. (Page 2).  Throughout the book are direct challenges to senior executives to work hard at clarifying and respecting how the organization spends it's time.<br /><br />One quote early in the book raises some key insights into how the organization really operates; \\"People tolerate management's logic, but they act on their own conclusions\\" (Page 14).  Thus the necessity of simplifying the infinite choices facing your people everyday. \\"People, not programs, plans or technologies, make the final choices about what to do and how to do it\\".  (Page 25)<br /><br />One of the essential barriers to simplicity is ineffective communication.  The book depicts such a stark reality, that I put the book down and pondered how often I do the very thing that creates complexity.  The authors describe a well known problem: \\"Time pressure allows people to justify behaviors they would not accept from others.  When people are in need of communication they want others to take the time to listen and create clarity meaning and connection.  However when they are doing the communicating it becomes a matter of disseminating information and taking any available e-shortcuts\\". (Page 24).  Ouch.<br /><br />Another key to simplicity is getting people engaged, which gains their attention.  One methodology depicted and outlined is how storytelling can engage your people.  The keys in creating the similar process to a story can help a business translate images and insights into action by developing a burning platform, describing where we are, what success now will look like and where we are going (Page 91).  Another really powerful set of tools.<br /><br />\\"People have limitless capacity to work smarter, as long as what you build is user centered\\" (Page 109).  This simple truth aligns the sections on how to work backwards by focusing on meeting the needs of workers and enabling them to control their work and improve results.  However, most senior leaders I work with have a tremendous difficulty in letting go, and in doing so create more complexity and lower the overall organizational effectiveness.<br /><br />The book is one of those which will remain on my shelf to refer to whenever I am leading change and trying to improve results through communication and improving processes.  Far too many companies and senior leaders fail to understand the basics of human nature, and how powerful the focus on simplicity can be.  Even the most basic opportunity, freeing up wasted time, can be like getting twice as many employees for free.<br /><br />My only complaint of the book is rather ironic.  At times the graphics and layout of the book itself was actually too busy and complex.  It would seem that a book on simplicity would itself model this simplicity.  However, in the overall view of how important these tools and ideas are, this is more of a minor annoyance than a fatal flaw.  This is a great book, and anyone who leads a team or an organization will benefit from applying the concept of simplifying the organizational environment to improve speed and execution.tools. <br /> <br />\\"People have limitless capacity to work smarter, as long as what you build is user centered\\" (Page 109).

Phil Lesh, the bassist for the Grateful Dead for nearly 30 years writes a comprehensive autobiography that chronicles his personal journey leading up to, during, and after his time with the band.  The book itself is a remarkable journey in that it at times is insightful and profound, and at other times incomprehensible.  After reading it I was left with the feeling that there was far more to the story than the glimpse we are given here, although I really enjoyed the book as it is.<br /><br />One of the highlights for me were the astounding revelations that the band itself was never that profitable, in fact he states that prior to their hit record \\"Touch of Gray\\" in 1987 (!) the band mates never made more than a basic living allowance.  While at times Phil starts talking in some strange language; \\"suddenly we can see all the possibilities at once, and hear time from the standpoint of eternity as if the music had broken through into a higher dimension of awareness\\" (Page 128), it seems that the Grateful Dead were actually about the music itself not just the lifestyle.<br /><br />Phil is an avid musician, and throughout one realizes that this is no ordinary rock band, being influenced by so wide a variety of musical categories, and finally blending them into their own sound.  Perhaps that should be rather obvious given the title of the book, but I was surprised at the musical depth described in the book, from jazz to opera, from composers to swing bands.<br /><br />There are the descriptions of drug use that would make Hunter S. Thompson proud, but we see these depicted with honesty and reality as, as always, the eventual progression ends in the ruin and death of many of the band.  There are some great inside looks at Woodstock and other famous concerts I have heard.  Finally, some of the worn out tapes I received from various Deadheads throughout the years make some sense and I realize the internal significance from hearing Phil's depictions.<br /><br />The other really wonderful insights here are about just how far out ahead of their time the Dead were from a marketing standpoint.  Free taping at all their shows was \\"open source\\" before the term was coined and contributed to their popularity.  The way the tour was a family event, and a communal support network, including the start of their charitable giving, really depicts a vastly different way of life than the usual money grabbing rock bands aimed at getting rich.  As amazing at it seems, they never sold out anything but shows.  In this day of every other TV commercial having a classic rock soundtrack, the Dead just seem to be \\"authentic\\".<br /><br />I guess one of the most telling aspects of the emotional resonance of the book is that I pulled out a live Dead CD and played away as if it was 1982 again when my friend John Hiltzheimer and I used to have them as a perpetual soundtrack in the background of our various adventures.  Overall, this book is a must for anyone who has been a fan of the band, and is well written autobiography and inside look into a cultural phenomenon for the novice.  The book is written in an easy conversational tone, and except for the occasional lapses into the strange language of music and hallucinogens, is a good story with historical context.about just how far out ahead of their time the Dead were from a marketing standpoint.

So, what is a \\"killer app\\" anyway?  According to Tim, it is defined as \\"an excellent new idea that either supersedes an existing idea or establishes a new category in its field\\". (Page 11).  This is an important definition, because taken in the context above, Tim is saying that \\"love\\" applied in a business setting can essentially transform your work, your success, and most importantly you, and in that way supersedes the current ego-centric world of business.<br /><br />Tim uses countless examples to show that tomorrow's value in the business world will be about \\"fuzzy intangibles\\" that add value to your customers and company.  In fact, when reading this book there are so many examples about \\"how to\\" do things that will increase your success, it would be easy to think it's just another self help book.  For example, he discusses the importance of Knowledge, Network, and Compassion in our relationships, as his main themes.  As good these ideas are, they miss the point if taken as self help guidelines.<br /><br />The main point here is that love is not selfish.  The thread he weaves throughout the book is a message about caring for others, not with the expectation of getting something in return, but because it is the right thing to do and will make a difference to them.  It is the \\"pay it forward\\" philosophy in action.  Now, there is no doubt that often the impact comes back in a positive way through a network contact or returned favor, and he cites many examples of how his own success was based on these. But even when there is nothing in it for you, care for others anyway.  When others are in no position to do anything for you, care for them and give to them anyway.<br /><br />That is how radical this book is.  It flies against the corporate gravity which pulls us into a place of self focus and measuring everything in terms of its personal ROI.  In that way, love is truly a killer app.  I recommend this book.  Read it, and then go make a difference for someone.make a difference for someone.	2005-04-27
US	49850969	R3K7EO1GZB377K	157673708X	841143566	The Veritas Conflict	Books	4	14	14	N	N	Veritas, Christo et Ecclesiae	\\"Veritas, Christo et Ecclesiae\\" means \\"Truth for Christ and the Church\\". Believe it or not it was the original motto of none other than Harvard University.<br /><br />In this novelization, we look behind the scenes and through the lens of two sides of a story involving the change of Harvard into a secular University, and the foundational views held today.  The story is of Claire Rivers, a freshman at Harvard.  Unknowingly she is to become involved in the middle of a battle for the spirituality of Harvard University.  The other look we get is from the perspective of the spiritual battle waging behind the scenes between good and evil, angels and demons.<br /><br />The book starts with the beginning of this battle which takes place some two hundred years ago, and sets the foundation for what is occurring today.  The book tackles openly subjects like moral relativism, abortion, free speech, and secular humanism, and how prevalent and one sided today's University settings are.  The book is decidedly from a Christian perspective, and at times the solutions are a bit too pat and the characters a bit too one dimensional.  The most accurate portrayals are the every day arguments that take place in University classrooms today on the subjects of Philosophy, Sociology, History and so on.<br /><br />The novel is fast paced, and written exceptionally well. The moving back and forth between the spiritual plane and the physical is done well, although Frank Perretti's book \\"This Present Darkness\\" set the standard on that.  It is a great story and as such was hard to put down.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone curious about the duality between the physical world and the spiritual plane, as these depictions challenge the imagination.  While many may find some of the plot lines too easily wrapped up, it is a good novel to enjoy and some thought provoking material and statements about spirituality, morality and philosophy.	2005-04-23

Books	3	15	23	N	N	A collection of interviews and random thoughts	I have always been a bit of a fan of Charles Barkley, both as a basketball player and a TV commentator for the NBA.  The primary reason for that was that Charles always had something to say.  He had some of the best interviews, and made controversial statements that added some much needed variety to the standard \\"we played hard\\" quotes most NBA players slogged through.<br /><br />However, there is a big difference between \\"always having something to say\\" and \\"saying something\\". This book is a collection of interviews I presume to be on the subject of race.  However, the questions and \\"conversations\\" between Charles and other celebrities like Tiger Woods, Ice Cube, Morgan Freeman and others are a bit too free flowing, and as a result if there is a greater point Charles is making with this book, after quickly reading it I have no idea what it is.<br /><br />While the subject of race is an important one, you will not find much deep introspection or tackling of issues here.  For a deep look on the subject of race in America check out books by Larry Elder for example.  What you will find here is some interesting dialog between Charles and others.  I'm not sure if that is worth buying a book for, but it is easy to read and interesting, in a \\"People\\" magazine kind of way.  Morgan Freeman comes off as the star of this book, and if you want to see the views of someone who seems to be quite grounded in reality, and a genuinely solid guy, check out his interview.  As for Charles, let's just say he always has something to say, and leave it at that.	2005-04-23
US	49850969	R7QM2S7RH2R96	0374292884	377846531	The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century	Books	4	28	37	N	N	One of the best books on the changing impact of globalization	The first chapter of this book contains a fascinating little statistic:  In 2003 some 25,000 US Tax returns were done in India.  In 2004 this number was closer to 100,000.  For 2005 it is expected to be 400,000.  As a member of a company which prepares tax returns in the US this is a remarkable and thought provoking insight into the speed at which global change occurs.  The book's conclusion up front is that if you are working in the US you had better focus on quality discussions and service, not the simple accounting work of the return itself.<br /><br />What the title essentially means is that the world is shrinking rapidly.  The book describes the incredible speed at which India and other developing nations are creating an entirely new dynamic in how work gets done, and information is shared.  He talks about Globalization 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0, with the most current adoption being only a few years old, yet gaining speed every day exponentially.<br /><br />This is not as simple as just \\"outsourcing\\" work to other parts of the world, but includes how US companies themselves employ wholly new ways to get things done faster.  UPS for example, is not only the way to ship your laptop to get it repaired, but actually does the repairs itself.  In some McDonald's your order at the drive through sign is actually processed hundreds of miles away in a call center and routed back to the restaurant in the form of an order and your photo to improve accuracy of the order.  All this takes place without your knowledge within seconds and 30 feet.  Jet-Blue takes the opposite approach to outsourcing, as it employs its reservationists from their homes. The productivity and loyalty improvements prove the approach works, despite the fact that many companies will never give up the illusion of control and thus fail to benefit in the same way.<br /><br />The book also looks at other ways in which this new global relationship requires a different kind of social responsibility. (Page 298).  Many companies are already looking at how to source supplies in a manner which encourages environmental responsibility.  Several companies have aligned certain standards of production, regardless of the physical location, that adhere to specific rules regarding hazardous materials, child labor, and other compliance issues.  He outlines seven rules he claims will help companies compete in a global world.  (Chapter 10)<br /><br />One great example is how EBay has created a self governing world community through its feedback system.  This type of approach allows the organization to create an organization that works globally without the usual command and control centralization.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very fun book to read. It is written so well that it is hard to put it down.  While the conclusions are somewhat weak, I took this as an acceptable fact given that this book is more of a series of observations as opposed to a thesis on globalization and the speed of change.  I recommend it highly to anyone who wants a more in depth view of the changes happening today and coming tomorrow, whether we like it or not.ady looking at how to source supplies in a manner which encourages environmental responsibility.

The views, both personal through his visits, and systemic through graphs and charts, make the need apparent.  I felt, both intellectually and emotionally, the desire to help.  So in that sense Jeffrey Sachs has made his case.<br /><br />What the book also does well is describe the many reasons why the cycle of poverty exists.  He discusses and dissects the many misconceptions of why many are in poverty.  He describes the greatest challenge is overcoming the poverty trap. (Page 73).  Several chapters go in depth into the economies of China, Russia, India and other developing countries.  I found these sections to be solidly researched and well presented.<br /><br />The book does a great job in presenting how certain investments can reverse the cycle of poverty.  Human capital, infrastructure, knowledge capital, etc., are all potential ways to influence and lift those suffering out of poverty, however these need to be addressed systemically in order to be effective.<br /><br />There are a few sections where he loses his train of thought and attacks American politics; this weakens his overall prose in my opinion.  If we are to truly commit to solve \\"world hunger\\" this will need to be a bi-partisan effort.  Emotional attacks on one party will not move this forward.<br /><br />The only real weakness of this book is what it doesn't say.  Jeffrey ascribes all root causes and solutions to a government effort.  In seems impossible in a nearly 400 page book on poverty, to not address materialism, greed, and the culture of valuing self above all else.  Yet no where does he address personal responsibility.  The fact that the efficiency of non-governmental charitable work through organizations like \\"World Vision\\" vastly outperforms any government processes is ignored here.  The book is poorer for the lack of addressing personal accountability for each of us to care for the poor in our world community.<br /><br />I recommend this book despite these gaps.  There are many who suffer needlessly in our world while we sit in comfort.  The book does contain some great insights into the systems that may help reduce or stop the cycle of poverty and the resulting tragic consequences to children and families. The book is written very well, topics are laid out clearly, and the research is first rate.lity for each of us to care for the poor in our world community. <br /> <br />I recommend this book despite these gaps.

While the book covers a wide variety of concepts, there are few which go into great detail.  However, those that are covered are done so in manner that still is a valuable read for anyone changing jobs or roles.<br /><br />In my opinion one of the richest subjects to address, is also the one covered in the least detail here - culture.  One of the most challenging and difficult issues to understand and respond to are the unstated, yet very powerful, forces at work which enable or hinder a new employee's organizational success.  Any manager in a new role needs to quickly understand the do's and don'ts so they can be more effective.  I wish the book had gone into far more detail on this subject.<br /><br />That said, the sections on how to ask the right questions, assess your new team, and negotiate success with your boss are all great.  The author depicts a STaRS model for determining the situation a new leader may face.  The four types of business situations are \\"Sustaining Success\\", \\"Turnaround\\", \\"Realignment\\" and \\"Start-Up\\".  The book goes into each situation and the different approaches required in each setting. (Page 63)<br /><br />I found the section on \\"Build Your Team\\" to be quite insightful.  Several tips are included that will be very useful for anyone in the position of assessing their new team. In particular are several questions that can be asked, and some great insights into non-verbal behaviors and other clues that will provide much needed information to lead and coach through the transition.  (Page 167).<br /><br />I recommend this book for anyone looking to put together a quick on-boarding program for new managers, or who is going through a transition themselves.  Many good ideas and a great overview of the areas a new leader needs to be aware of to make a successful transition.	2005-04-09

The book is a documentary and yet is so interesting I just burned through it.  One telling sign that a book has a big impact is how many pages I end up folding to ponder later. My copy of the book is full of those at the moment.<br /><br />The book looks at a number of factors that influence change.  Malcolm presents a theory that there are three kinds of people, \\"Connectors\\", \\"Mavens\\" and \\"Salespeople\\".  In doing a post hoc review of why Paul Revere was so successful and no one has heard of William Dawes, although both made the same night ride to warn of the coming British forces, the author postulates that the reason was because Revere was a \\"connector\\".  He knew people, and that was the difference.<br /><br />By far the most interesting aspect was the study of the power of context.  The examples of how the crime on the New York subway system was reduced are fascinating.  It seems that there is a \\"tipping point\\" in regards to the general condition of a neighborhood, or in this case the subway cars, which have a large influence on crime.  Called the \\"broken window\\" theory, it seems that allowing broken windows (or other deteriorating conditions such as graffiti), leads to crime because the mind perceives the lack of cleanliness and order to be a kind of permission to engage in \\"anything goes\\" behavior.  The cleaning and repainting of subway cars had a profound impact on crime.  An unusual \\"tipping point\\".<br /><br />There are applications that come flying out of this book.  The \\"tipping point\\" for the total number of people who can reasonably function in a group, the small things that an organization can do to create a big difference, the book engages the imagination and creates a great deal of thought.  While some may view some of the scientific evidence as anecdotal and less than perfect from a design and control aspect, this book is nonetheless fascinating and thought provoking.

One can focus on Jack Welch the person, or Jack Welch the business leader.  For those who choose to focus on Jack Welch as a person and how he lived his personal life, then I suggest he is not the man to follow.  However, if you want some simple, powerful and proven management practices, then he is arguably one of the best ever.<br /><br />I continue to be amazed at the simple clarity of his message: empower others, ask questions, tap into the potential of all of your associates, choose integrity and candor over charts, graphs, and politics, and spend more time in action instead of planning and posturing budgets.  I cannot read his words, or hear him speak without feeling again as I did as a member of his team at GE.  Without fail, I was inspired and honored to be at a company which really believed that bureaucracy was to be avoided, and those who could look at reality without the politics and act accordingly were highly regarded.  The one aspect I did not count on was that after leaving GE due to geographical and travel demands, those simple truths which engage and inspire people to reach stretch goals would be so rare.  In fact the most basic aspects of candor and open honest dialog about the business are punished in some organizations.<br /><br />The book itself is written in a conversational tone.  It is easy to read, and feels as though you are in a dialog with him over a cup of coffee.  Several key themes emerge which may be surprising to others who know him by reputation only.<br /><br />One, Jack holds no malice and actually celebrates those whose careers involved leaving GE for roles elsewhere. This is a rather unique view, as many organizations have a misguided loyalty requirement that actually stifles the very performance potential they seek.  Second, Jack seems to be more reflective of how he missed the boat on the whole work/life balance concept.  Third, his willingness to openly admit mistakes is refreshing and contrary to his criticisms by others of his ego.<br /><br />I found the sections on developing people, and setting business strategy to be most helpful.  He understands, where few others do, that huge PowerPoint decks and consultants will not meet the need of your clients, nor will the usual political tactics help your business move forward.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly, it is much more real than anything he has written before, and his passion and energy jump off every page.ingness to openly admit mistakes is refreshing and contrary to his criticisms by others of his ego. <br /> <br />I found the sections on developing people, and setting business strategy to be most helpful.

Woven throughout the book are 55 \\"Engagement Tips\\" to improve the culture and environment of your workplace or leadership to keep your top talent deeply engaged and contributing.<br /><br />At the heart of the book is the deep look into some why employees leave, and several comprehensive studies are summarized here to help dissect the real reasons your company may be losing talent.  When it comes to determining the real reasons for dissatisfaction, and eventual disengagement from your company, some of the key reasons center around \\"mismatch\\" between the job and the person, and basic leadership failures around coaching, feedback, value, recognition, trust, confidence in leadership, and a lack of a career development opportunity.<br /><br />What I found most useful were the many insights into the psychology of how and why people feel valued and stay loyal.  The book lists four fundamental human needs, which if not met, are triggers for disengagement and loss of talent;  Trust; Hope: Worth; Feeling Competent. (Page 20).  The quote that opens the section on coaching and feedback sums up the gap, and connection to the psychology involved in ensuring your organization can retain its key talent:  \\"The manager needs to look at the employee not as a problem to be solved, but as a person to be understood.\\" (Page 70).  The connection and human dynamic is demonstrated with clarity as the key to creating an environment that enables engaged performers, but it is also one of the most common gaps in leadership today.<br /><br />Another key element is the changing paradigm of what employees expect.  The book compares and contrasts and \\"old contract\\" with a \\"new contract\\" and looks at the differences between what is expected by today's workers and how this has changed over time.  (Page 98).  While covered extensively in other works, the book here also examines again the reasons why recognition, so vital to employee satisfaction and engagement, is often so absent from corporate leadership skills.  (Page 122).<br /><br />Overall, this book is a great resource and tremendously valuable topic for anyone whose business or organizational success is dependent on the talent and performance of their people.  There are enough charts, graphs, studies, bullet points and sources here to keep the most analytic person engaged throughout.  A very comprehensive and well done collection of studies and information which provide a clear roadmap for improving the engagement and performance of your people while lowering attrition and disengagement.

I will say this about Jose Conseco, he is honest.  There was never any question he had some success in baseball, but he actually credits it all to steroid use.  Throughout this book you will not find any stories of regret, but rather a series of bold statements about why everyone should use steroids and growth hormones to better themselves.<br /><br />Jose writes in a conversational style, which is good, because this is by no means a solid literary work.  Nonetheless it was interesting.  Jose depicts that throughout his career racism held him back.  He decries what he considers the special treatment given to Mcgwire, Ripkin Jr., and other white \\"All American\\" players.  While he may have a point, he seems to be ironically unaware that he made millions for playing baseball, so his treatment was hardly the stuff of civil rights violations.<br /><br />Further, while his honesty at times credits his charity work, it also exposes him for a typical womanizer who doesn't get it.  When his wife cheats on him, he is devastated, but never connects the dots to how she may have felt with the \\"hundred or so\\" times he cheated.  This is typical of the book, honest to a fault, and Jose comes off looking like a spoiled and irresponsible playboy, an image he is unsuccessful in shaking with this effort.<br /><br />Overall, an interesting and honest look at the steroid prevalence in baseball according to Canseco.  Baseball fans will find it interesting, but it isn't much than a curiosity beyond that.<br /><br />As a post script, it appears that nearly everyone he fingers in the book has in fact been \\"outed\\".  The most obvious example is Palmero, whose sure Hall of Fame career is now very questionable after his lies to Congress and subsequent positive test for steroids.  At the time the book was released, who knew that Canseco of all people would be left standing?  It is still a poorly written book by all accounts, but at least it has some credibility now.	2005-03-27

At some point, and it's hard to tell exactly when, the media evolved to be politically biased. The objectivity the previous generation grew up with was replaced by increasingly obvious attempts to make and impact the news through political labels, and clearly biased language and news coverage.<br /><br />Much of this book covers issues well documented elsewhere, most notably in Goldberg's expose \\"Bias\\", wherein Goldberg describes how the CBS team became little more than paid Liberal spokesmen.  So, as a few other reviewers have mentioned, the overall effect of this book is that is feels a bit dated.  However, if you have not previously read or studied this issue, then this book is a great place to start.<br /><br />The topics are organized into three sections.  The first, The Real Source of Bias, covers the fact that the vast majority of those in media positions simply see the world through their own lens and project that outward, often without realizing it.  Section two depicts how many of the significant moral and ethical issues of our time are increasingly presented with a slant far to the Left.  So when election results and polls that show the American public is no where near at the level of alignment with how the media elite would have us believe, the media seem genuinely surprised.  The key issues include abortion, the environment, religion, gay rights, gun control, and others.  The final section looks at some of the most egregious depictions of bias, including the hilariously biased coverage by the networks in the 2000 Presidential election.<br /><br />The book is so well documented it would be impossible to start quoting some of the hundreds of quotes and evidence of this media shift, and represent the book.  I will say that those who may find themselves on the far left politically or socially may not want to read this, as the book itself is, ironically, biased against that end of the political spectrum.<br /><br />Overall, easy to read, fascinating and well documented information, but perhaps a bit dated.  Recommended for those who have an interested in better understanding why and how the media became so obsessed with being the news, instead of reporting it.t end of the political spectrum. <br /> <br />Overall, easy to read, fascinating and well documented information, but perhaps a bit dated.

I was most struck by the profound similarities between the journey the author took, resulting in this book, with where I find myself today and where I want to be.  The short quote on the back cover states this:  \\"Like many of us, Larry Hehn avoided \\"the Prize\\" for years.  Rather than use his unique talents to pursue his true vocation, he traded the full use of his gifts for the false security of a predictable income\\".  That grabbed my attention.<br /><br />The book itself is simple, and straightforward, but often it is in simplicity where we find truth.  He addresses very basic philosophies that impact our lives, including choosing our attitude, recapturing child like wonder, acknowledging our weaknesses, taking risks, and how to take others with us by sowing generously and selflessly.<br /><br />The book contains sections in the manner of a workbook, where you can write in personal views and answer some of the direct questions posed.  The formatting allows one to read the whole book quickly, or take a quick section in a few minutes and work through it.  It would be an ideal book for a study group to take on a section a week.<br /><br />I found the tone to be light and encouraging, while at the same time direct and motivating.  Sometimes wisdom comes in simple packaging, and here is a great example of that concept in practice.	2005-03-26

This is one of the most fascinating books I have read in some time.  The book centers on the concept of how fast we really do make judgments, called \\"thin slicing\\", and how deeper analysis can sometimes provide less information than more.  It is all about cognitive speed.<br /><br />The concept of \\"thin slicing\\" is dissected and explained.  What I found fascinating, and also common sense, is that we process information on a subconscious level, \\"behind the door\\", and process so holistically that to over analyze can actually hinder our ability to make decisions.<br /><br />Several key points are applicable in business.  One of the in depth studies looked at a military leader who was particularly successful.  One of his more poignant observations was that a great leader needs to let the people do their work.  When deciding how often to follow up \\"you are diverting them, now they are looking upward instead of downward.  You are preventing them from resolving the situation\\". (Page 118)  Further \\"allowing people to operate without having to explain themselves constantly ... enables rapid cognition\\" (Page 119).  It seems that most micro-management actually prevents people from successful decision making.<br /><br />Another strange phenomenon occurs when we try and explain how we come to some conclusions.  It seems that the more we try to analyze how we come to some conclusions the less reliable they become.<br /><br />The ability to absorb and detect minute changes in facial expressions allows us to essentially \\"read minds\\" if we pay attention.  There are several chapters on how reliable we can be in predicting behavior with very little information.<br /><br />Overall, this book is so well written that I had a hard time putting it down.  My only compliant, and it is a minor one, is that the book just ends.  No summary or wrap up, just \\"boom\\", it's over.  However, that is more a testament to how engaging the book is I suppose.  Highly recommended!	2005-03-21

Two well known Christian philosophers review how the Church handles various issues.  In each chapter one writes an essay, and the other responds with points of his own. Most often they agree in principle, but occasionally we do get two different views. The over riding theme is how post-modernism is changing the culture and how we view an historical interpretation in light of this supposed shift.<br /><br />The topics include;  Theology, End Times, Social Action, Culture, Leadership, Environmentalism, Truth and several others.  The more compelling discussions are those centered on social issues.  McLaren in particular takes a rather critical view of all things conservative.  Compolo is not much more open minded.  In fact, Compolo makes some claims on the environment that he apparently read in Sierra Club brochures.  It was shocking to see how biased and inaccurate his views on the science of the environment are.<br /><br />They both do make some good points about the focus of the Church in being part of the world as opposed to a separate sub-culture.  While the writing is not a literary masterpiece, it is conversational and a quick read.  Overall, it is an interesting look at how two people view the changing culture and how the Church will, or rather should, respond.	2005-03-18

When she applies for the Company mentor program, she is paired with the Company President, who imparts some simple, but powerful wisdom about what great leaders do.<br /><br />There are hundreds of good books on leadership, but some of the best are those which take advantage of application opportunity and relay the concepts within a storyline that demonstrates how they are applied.  This book does a credible job of that, although the story is at times a bit contrived.<br /><br />The essential message is the SERVE model of leadership.  The model is simple, yet effective.  Buy the book and find out what the \\"secret\\" of great leadership is.  I recommend this book for anyone who leads people or coaches those who do.	2005-03-11

As a doctor, and an activist, he was on the front lines of the work that became the basis for the \\"pro-choice\\" marketing campaign.<br /><br />The book starts with his personal background.  The first few chapters are a bit dry although his background does give some insights into his later work.  He describes his early work in medical school when he was introduced to the Hippocratic Oath which prohibited abortions (Page 48).<br /><br />However, he became involved in providing abortions before they were legal (Chapter 9), and enjoyed the earnings potential.  Looking back he states that \\"I am struck by the uncritical nature of the task we set for ourselves, by the moral and spiritual vacuum at the core of the operation...And yet the thing was so obviously sordid.  Why couldn't we make the link between the ethical and the moral, the evident greed and callous motives,... between all these ethical indicators and the grotesque immorality of the act itself?\\" (Page 106)<br /><br />While many of course may feel that abortion is morally wrong, few have presided over 60,000 like Dr. Nathanson did.  What is even more shocking is that he performed an abortion on his own child.  He describes how he conducted the procedure with a level of cold detachment that only impacted him much later.<br /><br />Bernard has many strong opinions, and he is fully aware of the tragic mistake of his activism.  In an article he wrote he states:  \\"We must courageously face the fact - finally - that human life of a special order is being taken (in the process of abortion) and since the vast majority of pregnancies are carried successfully to term, abortion must be seen as the interruption of a process that would otherwise have produced a citizen of the world.  Denial of this reality is the crassest kind of moral evasiveness\\" (Page 127)<br /><br />Overall, this is a powerful book.  While at times it is a bit dry, the insights are remarkable.  If the perspective of one of the men who pioneered this practice, and did or supervised tens of thousands of these acts, is not valid, it is hard to imagine whose views would be.perspective of one of the men who pioneered this practice, and did or supervised tens of thousands of these acts, is not valid, it is hard to imagine whose views would be.	2005-03-06

It is written in a conversational tone throughout, and the author is a genuinely likable guy.  This book is autobiographical in that it depicts his journey through a phase of life, and his gradual awakening and acceptance of his faith within the larger context of the society he lives in, and the people with whom he interacts.<br /><br />There are several high points.  The first is the level of honesty.  This book does not pull punches.  If Donald is struggling with something, he just lays it out there.  There seems to be little attempt at positioning himself in a more positive light.  That is refreshing and makes for a very engaging read.<br /><br />For example, he states that \\"every person who is awake to the functioning principles within his reality, has a moment where he stops blaming the problems in the world on group think, on humanity and authority, and starts to face himself\\"  (Page 20).  He depicts how his own world is turned upside down when he realizes that despite his moral views about helping others, he is doing next to nothing for anyone else.<br /><br />He also depicts his own journey into a sort of fundamentalist control freak, and starts focusing solely on external actions.  He basically becomes a complete hypocrite because he doesn't follow his own resolutions. (Page 80).  He kind of lost me here though as he seems to find fault with the intent and takes a rather judgmental view on anyone who is more disciplined than he is.  Which is about everyone, it would seem.<br /><br />In a sense the book allows the reader to see Donald Miller in a clearer light than he sees himself.  He acknowledges that many of his rather liberal friends have no substance behind what they feel; it is all just for show and to fit in with others.  He describes his anti-Bush friend as \\"She decided what to believe based on whether other people who believed were a particular fashion that appealed to her\\". The irony here is that this is the same approach that Donald himself takes on nearly every decision he makes.  He time and again relies on his perceived value to others and on what others around him reflect to decide who he is and what he should do.  He seems to genuinely value fitting in more than his faith.<br /><br />The book has some really great moments of clarity though.  I was at times inspired by his willingness to be honest, and truly put himself out there selflessly for others.  In the end he is the walking definition of how God uses imperfect people for good in the world. Overall, I recommend the book as you too will enjoy the journey, if you are at all introspective.

His basic stance can be found on the cover with the statement:  \\"Why the Right gets it wrong and the Left doesn't get it\\".  Certainly a compelling topic considering the combination of religion and politics in America.<br /><br />The best of the book can be found in his assertion that Christian beliefs focus on serving others, namely the poor.  He asserts throughout the book that serving the poor and addressing the problems of poverty is a profoundly religious view that is no where to be found in the Republican Party, despite their assertions of being aligned to Christianity.  Throughout the book he attacks Republicans for their policies which do not support those in need.  I agree with him on this, despite his continued use of terminology like \\"tax cuts for the rich\\" which is nothing more than propaganda, and not related to reality. He admits as such. (Page 103). Nonetheless he makes some great points on why our government policies should serve those in need, both in America and throughout the world.<br /><br />However, it should be noted that this book is nowhere near the \\"middle\\"; it is a far left view of political issues.  He makes some outrageous claims such as: \\"Most of us do not support school backed prayers or the Ten Commandments in a court house\\" (Page 70).  Who is he talking about?  Jim's diatribes against the war in Iraq are fair enough, but he makes no mention of any other conflicts such as WWII, and what a Christian response should have been then.  He further ignores the fact that his ideas about Iraq were only postulated at the 11th hour when it was far too late.  Where was he during the Clinton Administration, and when Saddam was refusing to comply with UN regulations, or making a mockery of the \\"oil for food\\" program?  He makes some good points against the war, but his solutions are a bit late.<br /><br />However, there are some glaring defects here as well.  First, he makes no references at all to the core worldview within the Left of moral relativism.  In a 300 plus page book, which is about how each party fails to understand or align itself with Biblical principles, to fail to even acknowledge this basic worldview of the Left and how it contrasts with religious beliefs is astounding.  It is one reason many Christians will not vote Democrat despite the issues on the Republican Party.<br /><br />The second area that is even more of a blind spot for Wallis is the issue of abortion.  He does little more than pay lip service and wink at the issue, by failing to speak out in any meaningful way against the practice.  Despite his views glorifying those who are non-violent supporters of the impoverished and oppressed, the person most known for her work with the poor - Mother Theresa - speaks of abortion as promoting violence.  Her view contrasts vividly with Jim's  support of non-violent approaches to social issues.  His support for legal abortion is nothing short of hypocritical when combined with his other stances against violence.<br /><br />Overall, the book is written well.  I do recommend the book; it contains some excellent and thoughtful ideas well worth reading and pondering.  Jim makes some points about serving the poor and that it is a profoundly religious issue not supported by Republicans.  I agree completely.  However, in the end he avoids any real condemnation for some deep defects within the Democratic Party, choosing to simply make vague statements about how they are reluctant to embrace religious principles.

I also enjoyed the few books that did not follow his usual lawyer genre, like the Painted House.<br /><br />In this latest effort, we follow the life of an ex-lawyer who has just been given a Presidential pardon, and released into Bologna, Italy, where it will be his job to assimilate, learn the language and survive.  In reality the CIA wants him out there to see which government will find him and kill him, thereby helping them solve some of the mystery behind the international incident that landed the lead character in prison to begin with.<br /><br />So, most of the book takes place in Italy, where our character has assumed a new name and is trying to learn Italian and fit in.  This is where it appears that Grisham took a long vacation from writing, spent several months strolling around the city, noting all the historical and cultural sights and sounds, and then sat down and wrote a book around what is basically a tourist guide to Bologna Italy.  Seriously, it really does read this way.  After dozens of pages describing the most arcane aspects of the city, all of which are quite interesting yet have nothing to do with the story, this foundation starts seeming a bit obvious.<br /><br />However, it works.  I really did enjoy the brief vacation myself.  The book reads with a balance of calmness and tension.  Towards the end it all comes together in typical Grisham fashion.  In fact, just take the first 5 and last 5 chapters and you have a garden-variety Grisham thriller.<br /><br />I recommend waiting for the paperback, but do recommend this book if you both like Grisham novels, and love Italy.	2005-01-30

My role involves coaching of senior leaders and my own team, so the title of this book urged me to pick it up and read it.  However, I was surprised to find that despite the title, this book is really geared towards self reflection and self awareness of ones own opportunities.<br /><br />The book really gets into depth in examining style.  For example, the author looks at the FedEx model of leadership and the nine elements of \\"style\\". (Page 37)  The book looks at case studies, and how our own personal psychology holds us back.  Included are dozens of pages of person questions to answer which are designed to allow for self reflection of what in our lives drives us, and may hinder our ability to effectively perform.<br /><br />Throughout the book are business case studies, tips, and insights too numerous to list.  Among the more impactful are the sections on how to improve communications by slowing down, use of silence and pausing for effect. (Page 136)  Also, one can always benefit from a better control of the \\"minutiae of acting\\" (Page 145).  The author examines how the little aspects of posture, dress, and facial expressions, may impact a leader's effectiveness.  While much of this is obvious, the book uses some fascinating examples of how these elements of our \\"presentation\\" have bigger impacts than we realize.  I personally learned a few new things, despite how frequently I have studied this factor of interpersonal relationships.<br /><br />The latter sections cover emotional intelligence, something very important to all leaders.  Not much new here, but the topic itself is vital to effective leadership, and gets more important the higher the level and responsibility of the position.<br /><br />Overall, a very useful book.  The author uses examples from Pepsi-Co and even names a person I knew while working there.  The opportunity for self reflection by completing the pages of questions would be invaluable, and I will go back and complete them myself when time allows.  Highly recommended for anyone in a leadership position, or responsible for providing coaching to senior leaders.ing the pages of questions would be invaluable, and I will go back and complete them myself when time allows.

At the time it was fortunate that our modern media was not in place, because we would have been subject to replays for weeks on end.  Even so, what I felt as a young person seeing the impact of the blow, and more importantly, what I felt towards Kermit Washington, stuck with me all these years and came back as I opened and started reading this book.<br /><br />This book details the lives of the two people; both before and after the event itself.  One of the more powerful elements of the story is how fast life can change. Kermit Washington is a man that should be admired for his work ethic, his tenacity in overcoming a tough childhood, and his charity work throughout the world.  Unlike many of the NBA players today who get involved in drugs, crime, and are some of the most self-centered people imaginable, Kermit is none of those things.  Despite this fact, he also appears to be a bitter man who cannot get beyond the effects of these events.  The book explores the fact that Kermit Washington is far more than a man defined by this one moment.<br /><br />Throughout the book I saw myself as one of those who viewed this man in a negative light for nearly 30 years and realized that I represent what Kermit Washington cannot let go of.  That the book has the purpose and result of illuminating that life is not always what it seems makes it a remarkable gift.<br /><br />The other side of the story depicts the saga of Rudy Tomjanovich.  The scars of the damage go well beyond the physical features of Rudy, although he has gone on to much success in his career as a player and a coach.  It was fascinating to read about the reactions of his teammates, and how close to death Rudy came.<br /><br />One valid criticism of this book is the editing.  The content is excellent, and the author has provided some great insights into an event that took place nearly three decades ago.  However, the story does take a bit of work to get through at times because of the way the editing results in what seems to be a lack of continuity in how the information is depicted.  One often gets the feeling that they are reading the same thing over and over.<br /><br />Overall, if you also experienced this event I would recommend this book despite some of the editing opportunities.

However, there are three layers to this story and the book is not what it seems.  The first layer is about the events themselves.  The second layer is about the role of the journalists, and the third layer is about what happened in our society to allow this to take place.<br /><br />Regarding the depictions of the events, the book does a good job at describing the revelations, financial statements, and spin control that gradually exposed the towering revenues of Enron to be little more than creative accounting, and inter-company agreements that were carefully designed to give the illusion of revenues.  On this sense the book is engaging and quite fascinating.<br /><br />However it is the second layer, the reporters themselves, that are the real story here.  Are they just reporting the news, or making it?  It seems they are largely unaware about their own role.  Namely, they had no idea what they were doing! Seriously, I lost count how many times one of the two commented that they had no idea what the complex financial statements from Enron actually meant.  This didn't stop them from reporting on it though.  Another look gives some of the disturbing motivations behind the \\"innocent\\" reporting:<br /><br />\\"Though Emshwiller didn't mention it, he hoped that their stories had a role in Fastow's departure. It was one of those perversities on journalism that reporters sometimes took satisfaction from the woes of people they hardly knew, or had never met\\". (Page 158)  \\"With a small pang of guilt, Emshwiller couldn't help hoping that if the guy was going to be laid off, it would come sooner than later\\". (Page 298)  What these quotes, and dozens more like it, indicate is that at least for one of the reporters, he was more than a little biased, and tried to expose some issues for little more than his own glory.  The only sense of humanity we see from these two comes from when Smith is talking to the widow of a former Enron executive who killed himself.<br /><br />I found this element of this book disturbing.  While these reporters were eventually correct, they often created a short term \\"run-at-the-bank\\" scenario that hurt the company BEFORE the facts were known.  I would surmise that neither of these two reporters were aware of just how poorly they can be viewed through this book.  Sometimes it is better to be lucky than good I suppose.<br /><br />The third layer of the story is about how our society allowed this corporate malfeasance to occur.  Smith hits on it briefly in a statement about how Lay's comments about earnings and financial statements were \\"Clinton-esque\\", but they both avoid the bigger picture throughout the book.  They seem content to grab as much personal glory for themselves as they can, and avoid the bigger and more difficult work of attempting to describe how our collective morality seemed to give way to greed in the early part of the 2000's.he was more than a little biased, and tried to expose some issues for little more than his own glory.

When I saw the title of this book, I couldn't resist.  I love books of quotes, and this one is excellent.  Over 200 pages of quotes, which are divided by topic area.  A great book to ponder and think about.  I especially enjoy finding quotes that match current leadership challenges or opportunities, as I find the best way to often lead through a new situation or effect change or transitions is with a quote that helps people see the point from a different perspective.  This book is full of very thought provoking material.<br /><br />I will leave you a few to whet your appetite, and then I encourage you to grab a copy of this book.<br /><br />\\"Care for the truth more than what people think\\" - Aristotle (Page 93)<br /><br />\\"We have this fantasy that if we just have enough information, we can control events\\" - Barbara Biesecker (Page 123)<br /><br />\\"The measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to deal with, but whether it's the same problem you had last year\\" - John Dulles (Page 165)<br /><br />This is a great book, for a great price.

Nope, it's much more than that.  This book is very interesting, and very well done.  I had several moments when reading where the correlation between the show and the philosophical concept was so direct that it is either a remarkable coincidence, or was actually written that way.<br /><br />For example, philosopher Jean Paul Sartre's play \\"No Exit\\" offers an account of three characters in hell, who are imprisoned together in a room.  They are sentenced to stay awake and in that room with one another for eternity. (Page 105). His thesis is that we are defined by others. Compare this to the unique end of the show where Jerry, George, Kramer and Elaine are found guilty of violating a \\"Good Samaritan\\" law.  Their punishment; sentenced to spend a year in a cell together.<br /><br />How often do you get serious discussions about the philosophical foundations of the \\"Castanza Maneuver\\", or how Socrates and Kramer may share some of the same philosophical focus?  When you can combine Plato and Elaine Bennes in the same book that is saying something.  The book itself is a series of essays.  Some of these are fabulous, some a bit of a stretch, but the overall effect is that the reader is exposed to countless philosophical concepts that may be otherwise unknown to many Seinfeld viewers.  If the popularity of the show can help deepen the thinking of a few, then that is worthwhile.<br /><br />While the title suggests a light fare, the book is anything but that.  In all honesty, had the book not been divided into rather short chapters that could be read one at a time, I may not have made it through.  The concepts are actually often quite deep, a stark contrast to the easy to digest commonality of the show.  Where the book gets the biggest hit is in the discussion of the fact that the show is actually about everything, not nothing.<br /><br />A fun read for Seinfeld fans and anyone who would like a quick introduction to some of the most highly regarded philosophical minds in history.  Combine this with a discussion of whether a chicken salad on rye is really the opposite of tuna on toast, and you have a winner.ng, not nothing. <br /> <br />A fun read for Seinfeld fans and anyone who would like a quick introduction to some of the most highly regarded philosophical minds in history.

As such this book is outstanding, and discusses some tried and true communication techniques that all too often are underutilized.  The authors are both adept communicators, one being a cabinet-level speechwriter, and the other a highly regarded communications director.<br /><br />The book is well written, and very easy to read.  One aspect I really enjoyed is the numerous \\"personal notes\\" written on many pages, which share some stories related to the texts.  In this book one of the main insights is that \\"effective communication is a way of life\\".  When considering the lack of \\"attentiveness\\" in the section titled \\"Can you hear me now\\" the authors depict the paradox of modern life due to technology, as we have not really become a \\"global village\\", rather modern people have largely become \\"global voyeurs\\" peering in through others windows with fascination, but rarely gazing eye to eye in shared interest, connectedness, and understanding (Page 2).  In fact one of the stark realities of a modern leader is that \\"most people care little if you built grand towers, or steered a Fortune 500 corporation.  They want to know one thing: Do you care about me?\\" (Page 9)<br /><br />Another key issue in communication is the lack of connection. \\"We seek impact without involvement, like a busy executive sending an assistant to pick up their sick child from school.  Real connection is never so safe or cost free\\" (Page 31).  In many situations the key to effective communication is to ask a lot of questions (Chapter 3).  Jesus was adept at asking questions which got right to the heart of the matter.  In fact, \\"whenever enduring life change is the goal, there is simply no substitute for questions that are sincere, situation-specific, audience centered and decisively clarifying, and that allow your listeners to decide for themselves\\" (Page 62).<br /><br />When discussing \\"authenticity\\" the authors describe four key decisions we each can make that communicate authenticity and build trust.  These key steps include; The decision to prize truth-telling over image-making; The decision to build character rather than manage impressions; The decision to offer what you have, rather than what you wish you could give; The decision to break free from expectations, clich&eacute;, and pat answers when they distort reality.\\"  (Page 87)<br /><br />There are several more chapters, each as in depth and deep as what has been described.  One of the sections on \\"story-telling\\" provides a fitting backdrop to the numerous stories throughout the book.  This book is well written and every page has nuggets of truth that resonates right to your heart.  Highly recommended for everyone who desires stronger relationships and an improved ability to communicate and connect with others.nticity\\" the authors describe four key decisions we each can make that communicate authenticity and build trust.

It is hard to imagine that this simple comic strip and these characters became such a mainstay in American life for over 50 years now.<br /><br />The book is nearly 350 pages long, and in addition to all the first two years worth of comic strips, has lengthy extras including an interview with creator Charles Shultz, and a forward by Garrison Keillor.  All of the extras are well worth reading, as they describe a man who himself seemed to be a humble sort who sees the world often in a half-empty sort of way but in the end has the kind of endless optimism of someone who never quits - just like Charlie Brown.<br /><br />The comic strips themselves are in fabulous condition for being over 50 years old thanks to having the originals well preserved.  The book is a ten in terms of quality.  The strip itself starts with a different cast of characters.  Lucy and Linus do not appear right away and are mere babies when they first appear.  In one strip Lucy is in a high-chair throwing her food on the floor.  Charlie gets his famous striped shirt after a few weeks, so it is odd seeing him without it.  Schroeder can play the piano from the start.<br /><br />If you are at all a fan of Peanuts, I highly recommend this book as a beautiful retrospective of where it all began.  While the quality of the book and the content is worth ten stars, an inside look at the beginning of the world that has impacted and reflected life for millions; is priceless.	2004-12-27

This is all the more remarkable considering that his original audience for his book were those in leadership positions in the church.  Thus, throughout the book are both organizational and spiritual concepts.<br /><br />The book is divided neatly into ten chapters, each dealing with a \\"mistake\\" and providing the counter examples of how these leadership issues can be reversed to allow for more growth within the organization and better leadership.<br /><br />The titles of the ten chapters are themselves fascinating and excellent at describing the leadership mistakes.  They include; The top-down attitude; Putting paperwork before people work; The absence of affirmation; No room for mavericks; Dictatorship in decision-making; Dirt delegation; Communication chaos; Missing the clues of corporate culture; Success without successors; Failure to focus on the future.<br /><br />Each of these chapters presents some outstanding insights into how leaders fail to make the most of their people, and get results.  One in particular is always the challenge of leadership in most corporations, the \\"No room for mavericks\\" describes how the most creative, and insightful of employees are often forced to comply with the inside-the-box thinking of the organizations current status.  Of course, without \\"mavericks\\" many companies simply fade out of existence, and many others become a shadow of what they once were.  Yet today inside many corporations are leaders so focused on compliance and control, that they may control away their futures, and drive those who are innovative away to other places.<br /><br />This book is simple, straightforward, and completely accurate.  Very highly recommended, as nearly every chapter could be a book in itself.	2004-12-26

I picked up this book because even though I grew up in the NW, I have always wanted to take a weekend somewhere quiet and romantic in the area.  Our trips home these days are filled with relatives and family events, which while wonderful are draining in their own right.  OK, well perhaps the stress of an executive job in corporate America, and two small, wonderful, relentless, beautiful, demanding....children makes the idea of a weekend with nothing to do but watch the ocean, read, and relax, something to aspire to, and dream about, and well, something we must do now for our sanity!<br /><br />The book looks at romantic inns, bed and breakfasts, and small hotels throughout the northwest from the Oregon coast, to British Columbia, both in small towns and out of the way secluded locations to the big cities like Seattle, Portland and Vancouver.  The different locations are presented in full color, and organized by region.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the combination of descriptions and many personal insights.  The photography is outstanding, and each location is presented well.  However, I would depict this book as being more as a coffee table book than a travel guide.  Many travel guides have much more detail to use while on the road.  This book is one that can be used to make a choice, while knowing that follow up information will be required to execute your plans.<br /><br />This is a beautiful book, well written, and one that will hopefully generate the result of a weekend getaway for us in the near future.  A great visual and informational treat for anyone interested in visiting this part of the country.	2004-12-26

This book is not a classic novel, along the likes of a Hemmingway; it is rather a very enjoyable page-turner that will make a fun Hollywood movie soon. (Although of course considering the content and theme here Hollywood is likely to stay away)<br /><br />The book starts out describing some acts by people in \\"eco-terrorist\\" groups, and quickly turns into the story of a young lawyer in Hollywood who does legal work for a wealthy philanthropist, and an environmental organization seeking to sue the US for damages caused by Global Warming.  It seems that not is all it seems with these groups and that they will use any means necessary to further their cause, even if that means to make up the threats altogether.  The lead character is quickly thrust into the middle of a war for power over public perceptions, money and the politics of environmentalism.  Along the way he finds himself in many tight spots, and slowly begins to unravel the truth.<br /><br />I have heard that some have taken issue with the way Crichton has depicted the \\"spin\\" of environmental groups.  In particular, the shots taken at hypocritical Hollywood liberals who are often referred to as \\"Gulfstream Environmentalists\\" for the paradox of espousing conservation while be transported around in costly and high energy and polluting private jets and SUV limos.  There is no doubt that Crichton levels these folks in this story.  Plus one star for that!<br /><br />The book is easy to read, and is very hard to put down. I picked up a copy in the airport, read it on the plane, and then finished that evening and the next day. The beginning is a bit complicated, and I found myself having to skip back a few times with \\"who is this guy again\\" types of questions, but once the set ups are complete it is an easy plot to follow from there.<br /><br />Sure, there are a few plot holes, and of course the whole premise of this lawyer flying around the world with government agents is absurd, and a few of the characters are a bit one-dimensional, but it is what I thought it would be and why I bought it - fun, exciting, and great entertainment.d a few of the characters are a bit one-dimensional, but it is what I thought it would be and why I bought it - fun, exciting, and great entertainment.	2004-12-22

It shows a willingness to hear another point of view\\".  (Page 1)  OK, that and the fact that due to flight delays and a packed laptop charger cord, I have hours with nothing better to do.  But that notwithstanding, I always like the feeling of someone being grateful for something I do, so the invitation worked.<br /><br />What is this book about?  I had high hopes that it would be some sort of explanation of why \\"liberals\\" (although more likely merely Colmes) believe the way they do on a variety of issues.  Given the media promotion of this radical split in ideologies, the idea of hearing the far left side explained is compelling, even though in reality most people are moderate in practice.  Sadly though, this book does little deep introspection into the philosophical worldview of liberalism aside from a few political rants and hints of moral relativism, and I would best describe this book and it's position as merely \\"the other side of the \\"Coulter\\" coin.  Lot's of gross overgeneralizations, the occasional witty and funny caricatures, and the shrill voice of protest.  Not that there is anything wrong with that of course.<br /><br />There is a huge section on the war on terror.  I suggest skipping over nearly all of pages 39 to 95, as it is one sided drivel.  What was disappointing is that there is the opportunity for real discussion on the topic.  I would respect a dialog on why everyone, from the liberal left to the far right, came to the exact same conclusions on WMD's, and on the war decision itself.  Why and how our intelligence gave us (all) apparently flawed information is a dialog worth having.  However, what we see here no mention whatsoever of this fact, until page 149, when Allen uses it to justify and promote Hillary.  Seriously, no mention at all in 50 plus pages of the discussion regarding WMDs, namely that all sides made the same lies.  So, skip this section unless you are really into one-sided Bush bashing, then it will be fun for you.<br /><br />He states on page 78 \\"Embracing true liberal values will move us toward a better world\\".  These are strong words, with lots of implications; however there is little information throughout the book that clearly articulates what these values are, or how they make the world \\"better\\", or even what \\"better\\" means.  This is unfortunate, because I thought that was the whole point of this book.  If you think the dictionary definitions of the words will suffice, look them up and save your money, because that is about all he provides here directly.<br /><br />On page 130, the true bashing starts, and the book gets interesting.  The, \\"You might be a conservative if....\\" statements begin the assault in the form of the very generalizations and divisive language he decries from others.  He lauds the Clinton economy with no mention or acknowledgement of the dot.com illusion that propped up most of the growth and provided the foundation for the corporate scandals that broke soon after.  That he feels the O.J. case is as clear as your routine CSI episode, gives you some sense of delusion beginning, but it gets far more illogical than this.  When discussing abortion he uses the propaganda and obviously irrelevant words like \\"anti-choice\\" to describe those he disagrees with.  Even more amazing is his apparent disregard for scientific evidence commonly understood by the majority of middle-school biology students.  He equates an unborn child to an \\"arm\\", just another body part, and missed the day in class when they discussed how he came to be.  (Page 249).  This is by far the most amazing revelation, in that he is entirely clueless of the basic physical and scientific facts of life, and uses his ignorance to promote his political agenda.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the book.  He includes lots of emails, good and bad, from people responding to his show.  I also give him a lot of credit for writing a good book, albeit one that is merely the flip side of the same shrill coin he denounces in others.  Of course that is hypocritical, but it doesn't mean it's not well done.  The index and notes were messed up, but that is just a publishing error.

I think this is pretty obvious, but there is some great background in here on where and why this may have originated.<br /><br />For example, some in Hollywood have a history of supporting communism, made famous in the \\"blacklist\\" era, and this view is even more prevalent today.  The book gives dozens of accounts of one-sided support and glorification of Castro.  This is actually quite odd considering Castro has a long tradition of placing homosexuals in prison, based on mere suspicion or rumor.  When the various stars are pledging their devotion to Castro, do they have any idea what Castro's response to AIDS has been?  (Page 75)<br /><br />This is typical of how Hollywood stars often are hypocritical in their pet causes.  Whether it is slamming the President for not attending the Earth Summit and then of course failing to show themselves (Page 103), or wearing fur after being outspoken against it, the duplicity is actually quite hilarious, however this pales in comparison to some of the quotes about PETA.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox, former advisor to the Humane Society, wrote a book called \\"Inhumane Society: The American Way of Exploiting Animals\\", and in it he states \\"The life of an ant and that of my child should be granted equal consideration\\". (Page 123).  Um, okay...rright.  The many examples of these kinds of absurd statements abound.  There is also considerable space documenting the \\"intolerance\\" of Hollywood towards any beliefs that do not align with the far left.<br /><br />However, the author spent a whole chapter on smoking.  I have to honestly say that I didn't get the point.  Was he speaking out against smoking censorship?  Why?  Does he support smoking?  This section was unclear.  The other concern I had was the way in which Bono and others were depicted for their support for the poor and other causes.  These sections were also not very clear.  It seems that much good is done by some of these people, and that needs to be acknowledged.  So, minus one star for that.<br /><br />Overall, it is a very interesting book.  I thought the research and history in the beginning sections was fascinating.  Towards the end the book gets a bit shrill, but overall the point regarding the politics of the Hollywood \\"caste\\" system, and the hypocrisy of the intolerance towards anyone conservative, republican or Christian is of course shameful.  The book is written well, easy to read, and the topics are presented in a logical format.  Overall, the book suffers a bit from being what it is speaking out against - being too one-sided.It seems that much good is done by some of these people, and that needs to be acknowledged.

This book is one of those that I picked up solely based on the title and a challenging work relationship I was experiencing.  The self-evident reality is that we all have people in our life in some degree or another who \\"push our buttons\\".  However, what is always the real trick is how we successfully navigate such situations and accomplish what is needed while not damaging the relationship further.  I was hoping this book had some insights.<br /><br />The basic structure of how the ideas of the book are communicated starts with understanding and diagnosing the situation, then looking at our own past and how we effect our current relationships, and finally what resources we can draw on to continue to grow.  I found the most interesting of the insights were in the sections about our own roles.  For example, often we bring into a difficult relationship a very unrealistic expectation of the worldview of the other person (Page 5).  These expectations often create the very problem we blame on others.  Whether this is a generational gap with our kids, or simply just a different way of viewing the world, the effect is that unless we acknowledge and seek to understand, the other's behaviors will continue to baffle us.<br /><br />Another fascinating approach is how the author here attacks our often self-motivated conflict avoidance. (Page 50)  When we fail to provide feedback regarding another's behavior and its effect, we essentially \\"hate\\" that person by placing our own self interests ahead of the true caring for the other.  Strong words indeed, but plenty of examples are outlined that show how this works.<br /><br />The last half of the book centers on various resources a person can use to improve difficult relationships.  I found these to be useful, but not really unique.  Nonetheless, I agree with the author that proper use of these resources can change our lives.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good book.  If you have someone in your life that has a tendency to \\"push your buttons\\" or are otherwise difficult to deal with then I have no doubts that much of this material will be useful. The book is easy to read, contains great examples and is written in a conversational tone during the narrative and an easy to absorb format when presenting concepts.

Given that, it is no doubt that this book makes some statements that many will likely find offensive, but the more important aspect of this book is whether or not the depictions, stories and anecdotes that frame the character of this American icon are in fact true.<br /><br />I was stunned, no make that shocked and appalled, at some of the inside glimpses into her character.  When one thinks of the First Lady of the United States, the words elegant, proper, grace and such usually come to mind.  However, Hillary is far from demonstrating any of those personality traits.  If even one in ten examples in this book of her swearing like a drunken sailor, or treating those who were there to serve her with disdain bordering on abuse, are in fact true, she is the kind of woman that should never be held up as role model, much less serve our country in a position of power.<br /><br />Politically Hillary is a product of the left leaning culture of the early 60's academia. This worldview she carries to this day, having been a strong supporter of the PLO and assisting her husband in pardoning terrorists and ensuring Clinton would not capture Bin Laden when we had several opportunities under his Presidency.<br /><br />The most disturbing depictions are of the hundreds, or more likely thousands, of extra-marital affairs Bill Clinton engaged in with the full knowledge of Hillary.  Any doubts that this \\"marriage\\" is really a sham designed to further their political careers is removed if even a tenth of these depictions are accurate.  We all know Bill is an alley-cat with little to no moral center, but even I was shocked at the extent of his sexual escapades, which continue to this day.  Oh wait, that Monica thing was all a \\"vast right wing conspiracy\\" right?<br /><br />The book is an easy read, and one that paints Hillary Rodham as the quintessential ego-maniac out for personal gain.  The shameful last minute pardons she oversaw, the pilfering of White House property and the pursuit of her own power at the expense of others is shocking, disturbing, and in the end will be her undoing.  One example of her \\"it's all about me\\" approach is the way she slammed Newt Gingrich's book deal publicly, then promptly turned around and took almost twice as much for her own book. (Page 207).<br /><br />The book is a quick read, well documented in the back with pages of source material.  I have no doubts at all that there are aspects here that the author took \\"poetic license\\" with and perhaps embellished some of the recounts.  However, even if we only look at the facts that are admitted by Hillary herself, the result is clear.  If you are even remotely considering a vote for her in 2008, this book will likely change your mind. Hillary is as callous and heart-less a person as have ever been in the political spotlight, and this book contains far too many documented examples of her behavior to dismiss.ead, and one that paints Hillary Rodham as the quintessential ego-maniac out for personal gain.

This book is not a feel good effort, but rather shows America in the courage of Black efforts for freedom, the tragedy of the racism legacy, the wisdom of our founding fathers, and countless stories in between.<br /><br />That America is founded on the principles of the Christian faith is of course historical fact.  The top of the Washington monument states in Latin:  \\"Luas Deo\\", which means \\"Praise be to God\\" (Page 154). This and countless other examples of our spiritual roots are found throughout the book.  This makes the stories of racial strife even more difficult to read, as we have so many examples of how far we have strayed from our roots.<br /><br />Of the most powerful depictions are those during the civil rights movement.  The book contains dozens of stories, including some detailed depictions of the Birmingham Church bombing and the de-segregation battles fought in Alabama.  The story of the courageous Ruby Bridges who attended first grade classes alone and was subjected to countless verbal assaults to do so, is inspiring.  Here this brave little girl prayed for those who insulted her as she walked to school surrounded by Federal Marshals.  One cannot read this story, without being moved at her courage and faith. (Page 71).<br /><br />Abraham Lincoln spoke these words many years ago, which ring as true today:  \\"My great concern is not whether God is on our side.  My great concern is to be on God's side.\\"  (Page 169).<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good book.  The depictions and stories leave no doubt to our roots, our past triumphs and tragedies.  Easy to read in short bursts or in one sitting, it is well documented with pages of sources in the bibliography.  Highly recommended for all who are proud of our nation, and desire to learn from our past mistakes, and ensure that we live up to our spiritual heritage as a people and as a nation.up to our spiritual heritage as a people and as a nation. <br />	2004-11-24

Younger Readers (Awards))	Books	5	7	8	N	N	A week in the life of your local neighborhood wombat	I picked up this book in a bookstore and read it aloud to my wife.  We were both laughing so hard that others were giving us funny looks.  This is a wonderful book about a self absorbed wombat that discovers his new human neighbors.  If Seinfeld were a wombat, this book would be the screenplay for one of his shows.  The author has a talent for turning the mundane into the hilarious.<br /><br />The writing will leave you in stitches because the illustrations capture the mood of the little creature with absolute perfection. Written from the perspective of the wombat, the destruction it leaves in its wake is really just routine behavior designed to get some carrots, or oats, or whatever else strikes its fancy.  The illustrations are excellent throughout the book, and jump off every page, as are the depictions of the various situations the wombat finds itself in.<br /><br />One of the best children's books I have read in a long time.  This book is one of those classic stories that adults will love even more than the kids do.  We plan to leave it out for the holidays for guests to read, if we can keep it away from our kids.  I highly recommend this funny and sweet story to everyone.	2004-11-23

The topic is again the various aspects of political and social ideologies that Elder feels gives rise to a continuing \\"victim\\" status that keeps minority groups in a cycle of poverty, poor education and a failure to make the most of the opportunities they have.  He also discusses the various Democratic policies that simply make no sense regarding the environment and security.<br /><br />For example, the political posturing regarding the environment continues to show how difficult it is to sort through the complexities and get to the facts.  For seven years, eleven months and twenty-eight days in office Clinton kept the arsenic (in drinking water) levels exactly where they had been since 1942 - fifty parts per million, but in the very waning hours of his administration reduced the allowable parts to ten per million.  Bush put it back to fifty when he took office.  The water industry argued that allowing the change would cost billions, despite virtually no improvement in health risks. (Page 29)  In regards to the Kyoto treaty, 17,000 scientists as part of the Oregon Petition urged the US to reject the treaty. (Page 31) That this is nearly ten times as many scientists that spoke out on global warming is lost on those who see only political gain and do not appeared interested in actual discourse.<br /><br />Elder really gets going when discussing civil rights issues.  When debating Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney regarding accepting money from the civil rights leaders in Saudi Arabia (sarcasm) Elder points out something you will never hear from the Left:  America's 32 million black Americans are simply the best-educated, best-fed, most healthy, and most prosperous blacks in the world.  In fact, if black America were a separate country, its half-a-trillion dollar economy would make it one of the world's top fifteen wealthiest nations!  (Page 87).  Not surprising that this was a complete surprise to me.<br /><br />Larry Elder makes some very poignant points on public education, and also about the inefficiency of how our government runs the public school system.  The President of the Libertarian Ludwig von Mises Institute describes the data research that shows a surprising difference between the common perceptions in regards to the cost of private schools.  \\"The per-pupil cost of public schools averages $6,000, compared with $3,100 for private schools\\"  (Page 106)  The gap is even larger in California;  with Los Angeles public schools spending $12,300 annually per student compared to the Catholic school system in Los Angeles which educates over 100,000 and spends on average $2,800 per pupil.  In addition home schooling is growing at 11 percent per year, making a powerful statement about the quality of public education.  Larry discusses the political forces at work that result in this poor use of public funds.<br /><br />Never content to avoid controversial subjects, Larry attacks the faulty premise of the role of families in our society.  Citing undeniable statistics on the impact of not having a father available on crime, he discusses how the values of the Democratic Party continue to hurt the very people they profess to care about.  (Page 137)<br /><br />Where Larry really gets humming is in his discussions of how the Democrats handle race relations.  However, given how much space he uses to discuss this issue, I can't begin to do it justice.  However, Larry is in a unique position to balance the \\"victim\\" mentality often associated with how the Democrats treat their constituency.<br /><br />Overall, Larry is a good writer, explains his position clearly and provides supporting information.  Of course he has an opinion, and it may not be held by everyone, but he does a great job here with this interesting and engaging book.mplete surprise to me. <br /> <br />Larry Elder makes some very poignant points on public education, and also about the inefficiency of how our government runs the public school system.

However, John Maxwell has put together some great insights into leadership that are often taken for granted or not well described.<br /><br />The book starts with a solid question for any leader; \\"Am I Raising up Potential Leaders?\\".  What makes this focus important is the fact that too often leaders focus on leading for results, not for future leadership.  An important distinction.<br /><br />Another aspect of the book looks at the ripple effects of leaders.  True leaders are able to attract potential leaders because; Leaders think like them; Leaders express feelings that other leader's sense; Leaders create an environment that attracts potential leaders; Leaders are not threatened by people with great potential.  The author lays out what happens when strong leaders are not selected.  They in turn hire people with less leadership skills than they have, and so on.  The organization as a whole suffers as a result of this domino effect.<br /><br />Leaders who mentor potential leaders multiply their effectiveness.  While this sounds simple, it is rare.  \\"There is no success without a successor\\" (Page 11).  Leaders take others with them, or they are not true leaders but mere managers.  Delegation is the most powerful tool a leader has. (Page 159) However, if delegation is so important then why do some leaders fail to delegate effectively?  Some ideas are postulated here; Insecurity; Lack of Confidence in Others; Lack of Ability to Train Others; Lack of Time; etc.  In my experience the most common of these aspects is a lack of confidence, as many so called leaders never take the final step of \\"giving complete authority\\" to others.  This derails success and future potential.  I find that this is the most common weakness of leaders in corporate America, who in turn should not be considered leaders, but rather just people with higher titles.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good book.  The author asserts that leadership is both a combination of tactical choices and personal character, with the latter being the more important.  A great book, easy to read, with some assessments and other tools included.  This book will benefit anyone who wants to enable success in their organization through leadership.ry good book.

A deal that exemplifies the era of dot.com speculations, shady accounting, and wealth created by the absurd free-for-all that was the mid to late `90's.  When the bottom dropped out of the dot.com boom the merger left few standing and the biggest single financial loss in corporate history.<br /><br />The book looks at the storied and unlikely emergence of AOL, through an often dizzying and phoenix-like rising from the ashes of one failed concept after another.  Throughout, the narcissistic antics of the leaders of the company are legendary.  David Colburn, the famed deal maker at AOL, used particularly colorful language in his wholesale assault on those he sought to best (Page 46), never content to merely close a deal but demoralize people in the process.  He is but one of the many examples.<br /><br />Time Warner head Jerry Levin, who took most of the blame for the disastrous merger, was himself a study in what happens when leaders insulate themselves from feedback.  The sections on Levin are perhaps the most interesting.  Devastated by the murder of his son, and the events of 9-11, Levin occasionally demonstrated \\"jerry mcguire-esqe\\" moments of humanity, including a plea for the organization to dedicate itself to serving the public good. (Page 207) A plea that was met by outright hostility as it was timed with the release of the admission that the new AOL-Time-Warner would miss all of its projected financials.  Steve Case, himself a unique individual, is profiled as an enigma.  Both eventually take the fall for the financial debacle.<br /><br />Throughout the book the author provides powerful, yet subtle, glimpses of how real life values and meaning intercede in the \\"hamster on a wheel\\" joke that is the true character of many corporate executives.  Despite the money and the power, it is clear that many of these leaders were disillusioned and left wondering what life really means.<br /><br />Of particular interest here is perhaps the best example ever assembled of the power of culture.  The culture clash between Time and Warner was never resolved even prior to the even worse clash of the AOL deal. An executive describing the cultural issues existing at Time Warner prior to the deal underscores the magnitude of the gap:  \\"At Warner, if you didn't make mistakes you'd be fired because you were not taking enough chances; At Time the attitude was - don't make mistakes\\". (Page 73)  The clash with AOL was even more severe.<br /><br />The AOL executives were hated with a passion usually left to sports rivalries and terrorists, and often employees compared the merger to the \\"Nazi's invading Paris\\". When several key AOL leaders were ousted it was compared to the fall of the Taliban!  There are simply way too many examples of failed due diligence, obviously on the financial and contractual aspects of the deal, but also on the total lack of insight into the devastating impact of the culture clash and poor integration and leadership.  Blame flies unabated off of nearly every page on whose fault it was; the brash arrogance of AOL or the stodgy lack of vision at Time Warner, but regardless it is a textbook case study on how important culture and creating shared vision is to success.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly.  There are many lessons to be learned here, and it is an engaging and fun book to read.

The rise of the \\"individual\\" above the organization or team has caused more companies to fail to reach their potential than perhaps anything else.  The book starts with the premise that there are three basic human tendencies that seem to result in fiefdoms:<br /><br />1. We have an innate need to control the data or information that reflects on our work.<br /><br />2. We have a natural desire to be independent and in control of our destiny.<br /><br />3. We have a natural tendency to exaggerate the quality of our work and its importance to the organization.<br /><br />I have no reason to doubt these basics of the human condition, and certainly both see this in practice and experience it myself.  The rest of the book is then about how to solve for these tendencies and create an organization that is more effective.<br /><br />He outlines seven disciplines of the well-run corporation:<br /><br />1. The discipline of creating lean global processes and accessible data company-wide<br /><br />2. The discipline of standard templates and data<br /><br />3. The discipline of inspection<br /><br />4. The discipline of avoiding over confidence<br /><br />5. The discipline of avoiding fragmentation<br /><br />6. The discipline of constantly learning new skills<br /><br />7. The discipline of avoiding bottlenecks<br /><br />Each of these is described in detail, including examples and pitfalls, and suggestions for improvement.  He also discusses 6 disciplines of people development, critical to ensure that the problems that result in fiefdoms are overcome.  His comments on the often poor differentiation and reward systems among employees in regards to performance are well documented and laid out.<br /><br />Overall, the book can be read quickly, and is full of good ideas and suggestions, and most importantly a way to think about the people and the organization that may help create an environment that can lead to better execution and success.<br /><br />I deducted one star because the book is often dry. The author is a former COO of Microsoft, Proctor and Gamble, and therefore most of the examples come from these two companies.  The book was often too academic in its prose, which is not to say that the content is not meaningful or relevant, but that it is a more studied approach as opposed to inspirational.

Ann Coulter is often abrasive, and even obnoxious in her prose and interviews.  Point taken.  Also, this book is being knocked a star for basically being a rehash of her columns over the last few years.  I would have liked that to be a bit more openly advertised on the book itself, as unlike the other book I read by her this one is really not new material.<br /><br />Now for the book itself and its actual content.  I think that normally pointing out that the review is of the books content is an absurd redundancy; however most of the reviews here are simply opinions about Ann and her views, not the book.  So, let's look at the book.  It is quite funny.  Several sections on airline security measures after 9-11 had me laughing so hard I couldn't breathe.  Make no mistake; her writing is excellent and very funny.<br /><br />On several subjects her points are quite disturbing.  For example, her views on speaking with liberals and ensuring they are angry are deeper than they appear:  \\"People don't get angry when lies are told about them; they get angry when the truth is told about them\\". (Page 10)  Her point being that it is the truth gets the most rage as a reaction.  Her insights on the liberal reaction to war today and how it varies to previous wars, such as Bosnia, are interesting in that they expose a double standard which is obvious. (Page 62)  Her column on how the John Kerry plan is to appeal to the French is so funny it is hard to read (Page 64).<br /><br />Her exposure of the Democrat candidates' attempts at trying to appear knowledgeable and respectful of religious beliefs needs to be read.  Whether it is Dean lying about his beliefs, or Kerry espousing his religious beliefs while defying everything his beliefs stand for, the pitiful attempts of liberals trying to appear as if they respect those of faith is hilarious and obvious to everyone except liberals. (Page 104)  When it comes to union support, a long term strategy of Democrats, it appears that this too is but another tool of these people as the Teamsters overwhelming support the ANWR oil exploration but were abandoned by the Dems when actual jobs are at stake. (Page 138)<br /><br />Her most scathing comments are reserved for the tabloid level biased reporting of the New York Times.  There are dozens of columns that outline with fully developed documentation that the Times is often well beyond merely liberal talking points and may in fact try to literally use outright falsehoods to create public perception.  For example, the columns on the unconscionable support for the Central Park rapists and gang like attacks are best described as \\"pure evil\\" (my words) and Ann points out the obvious falsehoods used to support these animals. (Page 224).  When the Times finally understood that the Clinton's may not be the innocent victims they claim to be, due to their stealing of furniture from the White House, marked how off the Times staff has been. (Page 245).  That they fully supported a journalist who literally made his stories is just too easy to comment on.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very funny book.  It will obviously be perceived differently by those on the opposite ends of the political spectrum, but say what you will about Ann, she is never dull.  Well done.<br /><br />As a follow up read several years later, I stand by this review despite the criticism of it.  The book is quite funny and well written, and whether you agree or not with her, that is what the review is based on.tegy of Democrats, it appears that this too is but another tool of these people as the Teamsters overwhelming support the ANWR oil exploration but were abandoned by the Dems when actual jobs are at stake.

In one example, Kobe Bryant is offered the use of a plane by the Lakers to make his trips back to a Colorado courtroom for his alleged rape trial, and instead of being grateful for the support his team is giving him financially, is mad because he thought he deserved a bigger plane.<br /><br />The book is full of the insights into the battles between Kobe and Shaq.  Imagine two first graders with 100 million dollars each and you start to get close to the level of professionalism and emotional maturity.  It is often funny, often sad, and usually just shocking.<br /><br />The book is written very well, a breeze to read through, and a fascinating tale of psychological narcissism gone wild.  I recommend highly for fans of the NBA, or just anyone who is interested in team dynamics.  It will also explain why the Lakers got beat so easily by a team with far less talent.  A lesson to leaders in organizations everywhere.	2004-10-21

Written by an insider, a University student with first hand experience at UCLA, the book is extremely detailed, well researched and documented.  The facts themselves are not in dispute, as they are simply too well supported.<br /><br />Whether it is espousing their own personal belief system based on moral relativism while categorically denying any other beliefs to be shared,  or advocating the deliberate death of infant babies who are claimed to have less right to life than pigs, cows or dogs (Professor at Princeton, Page 2), or by supporting a \\"performance art\\" piece that involved oral sex and defecating in front of young students (Professor at the San Francisco Art Institute, Page 58), the fact that these Universities fund this with your tax dollars, while intolerantly and deliberately censoring any attempts at presenting a balanced view is beyond intolerant.<br /><br />It gets much worse.  So, how many of you are strong supporters of pedophilia?  Your tax dollars and tenured professors in Universities near you are in fact speaking out in support of such behavior.  A Professor at San Francisco State University states: \\"The category `child' is a rhetorical device for inflaming what is really an irrational set of values about pedophilia\\". (Page, 63)  A Temple University Professor agrees:  \\"Negative effects on child-victims of pedophilia are neither pervasive nor typically intense\\".  A Professor at Johns Hopkins University takes it even further by stating: \\"Those who oppose pedophilia are motivated by self-imposed moralistic ignorance\\" (Page, 64).  The book lists all the names and departments of the professors making these comments.  These people should be behind bars, not teaching our youth.<br /><br />The issue of the far left view of \\"tolerance\\" is one sided at best.  In an amazing story, one man is denied employment because he is a Christian.  A football coach for years at Nebraska, very highly regarded, applied for the head coach position at Stanford University.  He describes the discrimination against him; \\"If I had been discriminated against for being black they never would have told me that, they had no problem telling me it was because of my Christian beliefs\\" (Page 91).<br /><br />When it comes to supporting terrorism and inciting \\"hate-speech\\", the list of supporters among University faculty is too long to list.  On September 11, 2001 a Professor of the University of New Mexico stepped up to the microphone to speak to his class about the horrific events that had just occurred:  \\"Anyone who bombs the Pentagon has my vote\\" (Page 101).  The well documented examples of this type of reaction fill dozens of pages.  Santa Rosa Junior College defended one of its Professors, who warranted FBI attention by urging his students to write about assassination of the President by stating: \\"He has the right to say what he wants in the classroom.\\"  Apparently even if it violates federal law in doing so and encourages students to do the same?  The University of South Florida openly sponsors known terrorists (Page 143).<br /><br />The examples of anti-Semitism, and University sponsored groups who promote violence go on and on.  At UCLA, the campus student group was led by a supporter of terrorism, who granted $12,322 to the Muslim Student Associated while the Jewish Student Union received $0.00. (Page 163).  The University of California sponsors a group called MEChA who state openly: \\"federal immigration officials are pigs and should be killed, every one of them\\" (Page 171).<br /><br />What I have just described is but a glimpse.  The index of supporting documents, footnotes and sources is over 18 pages long.  The book itself is a quick read, well written and organized.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is concerned about what is being promoted to our youth.  Far beyond the media-friendly liberal propaganda and sound bites sanitized to be palatable to the masses, the true foundation for this worldviewis opened up with shocking clarity.ation for this worldview is opened up with shocking clarity.   <br />	2004-10-17

On the evening in Seattle when he had a chance to tie the record with a hit, or break it with two, he promptly hit safely his first two times up.  His record number of 262 hits was nearly 50 hits better than the runner up in the American League this season.<br /><br />This book gives a very personal glimpse into the mindset of the man who not only has set numerous Major League records, but is a national hero in his native Japan after winning seven consecutive batting titles there.  The book is laid out entirely in Q&A format and covers his entire playing career, his childhood, little league, his move to America and his first three seasons playing for the Seattle Mariners.  While most biographies tell a story, what is surprising about this book is how direct and honest he is.  It is fascinating to read about the mental and physical preparation he puts into the game.<br /><br />Recently a Sports Illustrated writer attempted to discount his hits record.  This was a huge miss.  Ichiro is the real deal, a major leaguer who respects the game in every way, plays his all for the fans, and earns every hit he gets.  The hard facts are that for 84 years thousands of players have failed to break that record for a reason.  An amazing athlete with gold glove fielding ability, an arm like Roberto Clemente, and the ability to turn a soft infield ground ball into two bases with a single and a stolen base.<br /><br />This book is worth reading if you are at all a fan of the game.  It is refreshing in an era of ego-maniacs and over paid prima donnas, that we have an athlete who takes his craft seriously, wants to work to earn every penny, and is humble in the process.  If you are not a fan of his records, then this book will likely make a fan out of you for his professionalism, respect for the game and attitude.  An unfortunate rarity in sports these days. A class act all the way.A class act all the way. <br />	2004-10-16

As such, the imagery and way in which the story unfolds is quite powerful, and often shocking.<br /><br />I am glad I waited several weeks after reading this book to write the review as I have found that images have stuck with me, and become clearer as time passes.  This in itself is high praise for a novel, as many are discarded mentally as soon as they are finished.<br /><br />In this final chapter of the saga we find the lead character still switching back and forth from two different worlds through the gateway in his dreams.  On modern day earth a terrorist has unleashed a biological weapon that has infected most of the world's population, and has the anti-dote in exchange for the nuclear power of the world's nations.  In the alternate world, Hunter, is still leading a small band in an attempt from being slaughtered by the enemy.  Without giving away too much, he finds himself with a most unusual and conflicting situation:  he has fallen for the daughter of his enemy.  The entire enemy is diseased, and has an actually quite revoltingly described skin condition, and this daughter is no different, so he must look past this and try and rescue her before he himself and his small group are wiped out.<br /><br />Sound strange?  You bet.  There is nothing remotely normal about this story or the depictions and events.  It sends emotionally conflicting messages continuously.  This is why it works so well as an allegory.  The writing is superb; fast paced, and always leaves the reader on the edge of the seat.  Ted Dekker is a writer of rare creativity and imagination.<br /><br />Start with the first book, read the story all the way through the three books:  Black, Red and White, (now no having to wait months between releases) and enjoy the plot and suspense. The deeper meaning becomes clear long after the story is finished.  Well done.the way through the three books:  Black, Red and White, (now no having to wait months between releases) and enjoy the plot and suspense.

If you are purchasing here on Amazon, please ensure you get the latest 3rd edition.  Basically the book outlines over 100 leadership competencies, career stallers, and performance dimensions, and specific information on each to help leaders improve performance.<br /><br />The competencies section is filled with some insightful leadership aspects that often get left out of most leadership books including:  Humor, Dealing with Ambiguity, Approachability, Composure, Caring About Direct Reports, Dealing with Paradox, Sizing up People, and others which are essentially the more difficult \\"EQ\\" elements of leadership.  Along with these are more traditional concepts such as Business Acumen, Planning, Time Management, etc., and all told nearly 70 specific competencies are discussed in detail.<br /><br />Each of the over 100 competency and other sections outlined begins with an examination and list of likely symptoms and behavioral results that may occur with an individual who is skilled, unskilled, or is overusing the skill.  Each section then lays out some possible causes, and gives some remedies which are pretty detailed and actionable, and provides a comprehensive list of suggested readings for further study.<br /><br />Not only is this information quite interesting to study from a personal development standpoint, but is quite effective at outlining information critical to building development plans for your associates.  I have given this book out to my team, and business leaders for years, and consider it the best tool out there to help any leader coach their associates and help them improve their performance and effectiveness.<br /><br />While the price of the book is high, the value is higher still if used consistently.  If you are a leader of people in any organization who wants to improve your ability to develop your employees then this is a book you will use.  Highly recommended.book you will use.

Granted, I was reading it while the Cubs were yet again snatching defeat from the jaws of victory by losing 7 of 8 and dropping out of the playoffs.  Not since 1969 did the Cubs have this kind of talent, and fail to use it.  Oh well, they wouldn't be the Cubs if they didn't break your heart.<br /><br />This book is really not a story about the Cubs, thus the three stars.  It is rather dozens of short stories by former Cubs players and other personnel.  There was no attempt at pulling the stories together; they are simply laid out in a general chronological order.<br /><br />The highlights are some of the funny anecdotes.  Rick Sutcliff describes some hilarious moments with Don Zimmer, and gives another view of Greg Maddox.  Mark Grace gives some great insights.  Several players imply racism was present in how Wrigley conducted business.  The Cubs were never known for their great trades or player moves, and some bitterness from former players' remains.  There are some touching moments as well, and many declare their identity with the Cubs despite playing for other teams.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a Cubs fan, you will likely enjoy these short essays and anecdotes.  I can say with some certainty that being a Cubs fan builds character.  Who knows, maybe sometime this century they will actually win the World Series, and in doing so, end the world as we know it.	2004-10-03

Baseball came to the Great Northwest in 1969.  The Seattle Pilots played one season of major league baseball before the owners saw a quick chance for profit and sold the team in 1970 to Bud Selig, who then promptly moved the club to Milwaukee.  Then Washington state attorney Slade Gorton filed suit against the American League for breach of contract.  In exchange for dropping the lawsuit, Seattle was awarded a baseball team in the 1977 expansion.  Thus begins the saga of the Seattle Mariners.<br /><br />So the Mariners start their run, not with public support, but as a trophy in a legal battle.  It didn't get much better for a while.  Art Thiel is a local Seattle sportswriter who chronicles the team in exceptional detail.  As an adolescent in Seattle I remember those Mariners.  He gives details, funny anecdotes, and describes the incredible playoff run in 1995 after two decades of futility that saved the team for Seattle.  That run led to the new ballpark and the historic 2001 season.<br /><br />For a casual baseball fan this book is well written and fascinating.  However, for any Seattle fan it is priceless.  While what happened on the field is known, Art describes what went on behind the scenes.  Japanese owners, Microsoft money, and Presidents of the United States were all involved in the process to secure the team to Seattle through their current ownership.<br /><br />A special moment for me was Art noting the back to back games against the Yankee's in the early lean years when Tom Paciorek hit home runs in the bottom of the ninth to win.  I was at those games with my father and those are fond memories indeed.<br /><br />A wonderful book, highly recommended to all baseball fans.	2004-09-27

Bill Blunden does an excellent job of articulating the issues related to offshoring IT and other work from America.  There are enough tables, graphs and citations included to keep the most analytical reader engaged.<br /><br />The books starts with an overview of basic economics, labor and capital and the technological advances that gave rise to shifting work across the globe in pursuit of lower costs.  The author does a credible job of outlining and detailing company practices from GE to American Express and how many consulting firms help promote this practice.  The book covers various labor laws including H1-B, L-1, and student visas.<br /><br />Were the book to remain a factual examination of the practice and elements of outsourcing and offshoring, I would be happy to give high marks.  However, the undercurrent of the author's worldview - subtle through the first half of the book - explodes in latter chapters.  When introducing the section on \\"Argument's In Favor Of Offshoring\\" the author let's his bias come through clearly with this actual quote from the book:<br /><br />\\"To be frank, it sickens me to have to echo the sympathies of someone like Carly Firiona or Brian Valentine.  Nevertheless, my publisher has requested that I present an even-handed approach to this topic and that's, ahem, what I'm going to try and do\\" (Page 82).  It is unfortunate that the author chooses to damage any credibility built on his earlier attempts to create a factual presentation of the issue, by further stating that if you actually swallow the \\"pro-outsourcing view\\" you ought to contact the poison center.  Hardly the even-handed approach the publisher wanted, but at least honest.<br /><br />The final chapter, a look at \\"Arguments Against Offshoring\\", is unfortunately weak.  The chapter is filled with accusations of CEO greed and poor integrity.  Tyco and Worldcom CEO's in particular are singled out. There are a several good points on how the media has been bought off by the corporations that both pay their advertising and do the lions share of the offshoring.  He claims this results in media silence on the subject, as opposed to an open dialog.  While these points are compelling, in the end few solutions are offered outside the contextual background of a socialistic entitlement that is never stated outright - to be fair - but seems to be his point.<br /><br />I recommend this book.  While it is obviously biased, it does so in a way that is so overt that the rest of the data allows for some interesting insights to be gleaned from the books content.  Wonderful presentation, easy to read, and well written.the media has been bought off by the corporations that both pay their advertising and do the lions share of the offshoring.

The foundation for the study is the comparison of the \\"seven deadly sins\\" and how they contrast with the moral principles laid out within the \\"Sermon on the Mount\\" from the New Testament.  While this study may not be unique, the presentation is so well done that the result challenges conventional thinking through ideological dichotomies that leave no doubt that morality can be defined as a moral standard.<br /><br />What is amazing is the diversity of opinion presented.  From Bertrand Russell and Friedrich Nietzsche, to Soren Kierkegaard and CS Lewis, from Isaac Newton to Calvin and Hobbes, the philosophy and moral presentations leave the reader with the task of sifting through the often opposing worldviews.  Interspersed throughout are hundreds of quotes, poetry, and depictions of moral values - both post modern and ancient.<br /><br />Each chapter looks at one of the \\"deadly sins\\" and it's \\"Beatitude\\" counterpart, and includes study questions and guidelines for further reading.  This book could easily be the basis for a long study of philosophical morality from across cultural and generational perspectives.  The study questions themselves are thought provoking and generate far too much to ponder and digest in one reading.<br /><br />I would consider this book \\"very highly recommended\\" in every respect.  This one will stay on my shelf, for repeated readings, for years to come. The index and citations alone are worth the price. I can also see this book as the foundation for study groups and further research.  Simply put, it is well worth the time to read, review and consider.	2004-09-19

This book is very well written, with a huge index of quotes and citations from a wide variety of sources.  The inclusion of countless viewpoints from across the philosophical spectrum makes for a very engaging and enjoyable read.<br /><br />The book is segmented into several areas of focus including values, morality, meaning, and more.  In each chapter Ravi opens with some contrasting viewpoints that start a dialog about how the logical conclusions of atheism lead to some rather interesting and unavoidable realizations.  Nietzsche, who is among the few to truly embrace the full conclusion of his beliefs, suffered tremendously as a result as his worldview neither answered nor solved the dilemma of a world without God. (Page 30).  Aldous Huxley, another renowned atheist concluded \\"science has \\"explained\\" nothing\\".  Darwin himself warned against \\"the presumption of believing that one could, by contemplating nature, be in possession of final truths, either in divinity or philosophy.\\" (Page 38).  Yet with atheism, the natural determinism is all that is available to examine such meaning.<br /><br />Quite often, as Ravi discusses, an atheist often finds him or herself denouncing, yet embracing, a value system that they cannot uphold within their naturalistic worldview.  Nietzsche understood this well and stated \\"When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one's feet\\".  Another famous atheist Bertrand Russell when in a debate on morality confessed the Achilles heel of atheism when he had to respond to the question of how one differentiates between good and bad, by stating he did so on the basis of his feelings. (Page 59)  Ravi clarifies his position and the corner atheism paints itself into by stating \\"not all atheists are immoral, but morality as goodness cannot be justified with atheistic presuppositions\\" (Page 64).<br /><br />In hard terms the morality that atheism teaches, implies, or espouses is unlivable.  Nietzsche himself bore testimony to that fact.<br /><br />What of the search for meaning and truth?  The face of atheism reveals only the human intellect. G.K. Chesterton warned that the insane man is not just one who has lost his reason; he may be one who has lost everything but his reason. (Page 80). Bertrand Russell recounts with some accuracy that the inevitable conclusion of atheism's search for meaning is \\"only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair\\". (Page 91)  After a long study of the many who have defined atheism, Ravi states that having in essence killed god, the atheist is left with no reason for being, no morality to espouse, no meaning to life, and no hope beyond the grave.  Of what hope he or she may possess, it is does not exist within the framework of their worldview.<br /><br />In the end Ravi discusses the hope of faith.  God has put enough into the world to make faith in him a most reasonable thing, and he has left enough out to make it impossible to live by sheer reason or observation alone. (Page 113).  G.K. Chesterton responds to critics of Christianity by saying \\"The problem with Christianity is not that it has been tried and found wanting, but that it has been found difficult, and left untried.\\" (Page 117).  The atheist risks everything for the present and the future, on the basis of belief that we are uncaused by any intelligent being.  We just happen to be here. That one is willing to live and die in that belief is a very high price to pay for conjecture. (Page 155).<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful exploration of philosophy, ideology and meaning.  There are quotes, citations and input from far too many people to count, and I finished the book with a long reading list for follow up.  If you are at all curious about the core differences between atheism and faith, then consider this a great place to get a quickoverview.a quick overview. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-13

It is an obvious play on Moore's own attempts at degrading and insulting others in his book \\"Stupid White Men\\".  That said, it is simply unfortunate the authors here chose to dig a hole down to Moore's level because the information and facts in this book are too important to be dismissed because of the insulting book title.  I fear that the factual information will not be read by those who are turned off by the title.  I have enjoyed some of Moore's work, and in fact gave \\"Downside This\\" a favorable review here, but Moore obviously has some issue with his tactics, which are exposed in this book.<br /><br />In regards to the book content, it is excellent.  I am sure by now that everyone knows Michael Moore is far from the \\"man of the people\\" he pretends to be.  He is a very wealthy member of the celebrity circles, owns more than one million dollar home, and in fact is quite smug about his wealth.  He charges up to 30k to speak out about the perils of wealthy, white men, which in a twist of irony he seems unaware of - he is.  In fact several Moore quotes show a man who is overtly arrogant about his wealth and how he has become rich while other journalists are struggling by \\"playing by the rules\\".(page 120).<br /><br />In regards to his films and books, it is unfortunate he falsifies information to the extent he does.  I think that he makes some good points.  In \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" I agreed with his stance on gun control, yet he wasn't content with facts, he had to lie and misrepresent the truth to get there.  For example, in one sequence he makes the claim that the young men who murdered their classmates did so while local corporation Lockheed-Martin rolled weapons of mass destruction through the streets.  Well, not quite.  Lockheed makes satellite rockets for placing satellites in space.  (Page 87).  What is even more disturbing is that this information was known, and filmed at the time, yet edited out.<br /><br />In \\"Roger and Me\\" Moore commits one of his favorite tactics.  He goes with a film crew outside of the Waldorf-Astoria in New York, and a Yacht club in Michigan to try and film GM President Roger Smith.  However, it was known to Moore that Smith had never stayed at the Waldorf and is not even a member of the Yacht Club, so obviously he wouldn't be filmed there. (Page 25)  This tactic Moore uses often to try and paint a picture that is patently false and misrepresents the truth - deliberately.  A bigger surprise for me is the quote from Moore that he doesn't even drive GM cars, preferring foreign cars!  This is hardly the man of the people who took on a major corporation for laying off its workers at the GM plant in Flint Michigan, when the result of his own consumer choices places their jobs at risk.<br /><br />In \\"Fahrenheit 911\\" he commits yet another series of misrepresentations.  I even know some people who are otherwise quite smart and level headed who were taken in by Moore's tactics.  He claims that the Bush family has ties to the Bin Laden family.  (Page 129).  I would hope so.  The Bin Laden family is huge, something like 50 or so sons.  They are one of the wealthiest and most influential in Saudi and lean heavily towards the west and America.  Having long since disowned \\"Osama\\" (who considers them all to be traitors to Islam) they are allies to our cause in the Middle East.  He claims that Bush invited the Taliban government to Texas.  Well in fact it was President Clinton who authorized and endorsed the visit, and Clinton who was supporting a pipeline which would have benefited the Taliban, while Bush opposed it.  (Page 177).  There are too many other discrepancies to count.<br /><br />Overall, the book is full of factual and well documented information, though often redundant, and mean-spirited in its presentation.  There are hundreds of Moore's lies and mistruths uncovered and exposed. While this may alignto Moore's own style itself, I expected better from them, therefore only three stars.  The index itself is worth reviewing.  If you are a fan of Moore's then continue to admire his talent in making fictional films to make his own self serving political points, but educate yourself on the truth behind his claims to better decide these issues for yourself.expected better from them, therefore only three stars.

This is not out of ego, but rather simply the way we usually operate.  However, the internal focus will often result in another company focusing on not improving the service or product by a small percentage, but coming up with something 100% different.  This requires that businesses think outside of the boundaries of their own products, services, or methods.  When thinking of focus groups, conventional wisdom fails.  Groups don't buy products, individuals do.  Focus groups measure group dynamics not individual customer insights.  A big miss, and yet another example of the hundreds of topics tackled here.<br /><br />The insights here are nearly always contrary to conventional wisdom, and thus valuable.  Whether it is the fact that \\"marketing is not a department\\" but the role of every single employee, or how to \\"position and focus\\" your organization on the right aspects of service your clients expect, this book has insights into a number of strategic alternatives.  The section on pricing also contains some thought provoking ideas.<br /><br />The book is laid out in a very quick, sound bite style that is easy to breeze through, or revisit from time to time.  Overall, I very much enjoyed the presentation and insights throughout.  I have about one of every 5 pages dog eared for future readings, an always reliable sign that the topics and information were worth the effort to read or review.<br /><br />One quote at the end of the book (Page 245) sums up one of the major themes:  \\"Services are human.  Their successes depend on the relationships of people. The more you can see the patterns and better understand people, the more you will succeed - and this book was written with the hope that you will do just that.\\"  A very highly recommended book, with enough critical thinking prompts to keep one busy for a while just thinking about how to apply them.will succeed - and this book was written with the hope that you will do just that.\\"   A very highly recommended book, with enough critical thinking prompts to keep one busy for a while just thinking about how to apply them. <br />	2004-09-11

His second band - The Style Council - put out some great music and perhaps more significantly did so in a way that defied categorization and confused mainstream US audiences outside of the coasts.<br /><br />This book is exhaustingly detailed, and looks at his career with the Jam, his Style Council days, and his solo work, with a level of inside detail not seen elsewhere.  We have details about his political leanings and often misguided attempts at making political statements against Thatcher's England.  The truth behind the self effacing humor that gave rise to the multitude of artsy and socially leading publicity and album shots is included, which everyone apparently took way too seriously and in the process missed the joke.<br /><br />However, what are missing are the real insights from the artist himself.  Of that we see very little.  One is left with the continuing impression we are on the outside looking in.  Aside from the smattering of quotes, the book is more a retrospective and journalistic report \\"on\\" Weller, as opposed to a book \\"about\\" Weller, or \\"by\\" him.  This distinction was disappointing in that I expected it to be more autobiographical than it was.<br /><br />Overall, a great oversight of his career, but for fans only.  There are too few insights into the person behind the music to appeal to the average reader.  While the content is exceptionally well written, researched and compiled, it will in the end likely please a narrow population of those already interested in the details.	2004-09-11

This makes for a more engaging read, but results in perhaps too many facts and figures in support of his views and precious few solutions offered.<br /><br />One fact that I found to be a bit disappointing is that it takes most of the book to get to any significant discussion of American consumerism, an obvious driver in this economic issue.  On page 138 he speaks of the growing personal debt fueled by an over reliance on revolving credit, but fails to mention any of the obvious issues of materialism.  Likewise he fails to discuss the fact that his own network and audience is supported through advertising by the same corporations he paints as greedy entities out to ruin America.  In fact, it was unfortunate that he did not go further into this issue in general, instead mostly ignoring the consumer habits of the employees themselves who are often shareholders in these corporations.  The issue of greed is largely an individual problem, one that manifests itself on a larger scale.  Like a satellite image coming into focus, the issue of corporate greed becomes at its origin an issue of individual greed.  This subject would have been worthwhile to explore deeper in this context.<br /><br />I do believe he covered a variety of issues, or sought to.  His brief discussions of political pluralism (page 21), the rise of the internet and the subsequent \\"death of distance\\" which has allowed the technology to support this offshore movement (page 50), and the role of labor unions (page 145) were all topics that could have been covered in more depth.  One interesting conclusion for me while reading is that neither political party has done much to stem the tide since Reagan enacted some tough trade laws over 20 years ago.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book as an overview of a subject that will get a lot of press in the next few months as we prepare for a Presidential election.  However, while the subject is certainly well explained, and Lou obviously has a passion for it, there are very few solutions offered. I was left with the impression that he feels corporations are generally greedy and exploitive, and the government is the only hope for the oppressed worker.  This is a bit too simplistic in my opinion.d recommend this book as an overview of a subject that will get a lot of press in the next few months as we prepare for a Presidential election.

While the subject matter of how to motivate people in your organization is all too familiar, Sunny has presented the common in an uncommonly good way.<br /><br />One telling sign I use to determine the impact of a book on business and employee related strategy is how many times I find myself stopping and simply thinking about all the ways I can apply the concepts.  While the basics here are not brand new, my copy now has more dog-ears than the local pound.  I think I applied the concepts in over half a dozen ways within hours of finishing the book.<br /><br />The book covers several top motivators for employees.  The chapter on \\"leaving your mark\\" was full of excellent suggestions on how to build employee \\"contribution\\", a key element in not only boosting internal performance, but building solid word of mouth business growth through referrals and retention.  Sunny hits the mark herself when she talks about how basically everything is marketing, in some form.  The chapter on \\"leading with your heart\\" was also quite persuasive.  It is unfortunately often that senior leaders fail to understand the emotional wake they leave behind.  That miss can cause serious barriers to the very performance they are trying to inspire.<br /><br />I only gave four stars because I thought it was a bit too short, and light on examples.  This is a quick read, and on the surface looks tame enough.  However, when examining the content a bit deeper there are numerous valuable learning's here, and more importantly, they are packaged in a way that resonates and inspires one to action.	2004-09-04

I picked up this book because I am a big music fan.  I love those \\"behind the music\\" type shows.  This book also intrigued me because of the many different types of artists they interviewed and how they were direct in asking them non-musical questions about their faith and backgrounds.  Since rock stars often get a platform to speak it is rare we hear them really discuss anything of importance outside of music.<br /><br />From Sammy Hagar and KISS, to Alice Cooper and Jethro Tull, to Green Day and a host of 90's bands I have heard of but never listened to, there were a wide range of musical styles represented.  The premise of these interviews is that a journalist from a Christian Music magazine would interview other artists and ask them about their lives and their faith.  Some of the reactions were what you would expect.  Henry Rollins basically acted as he is depicted, and Sammy Hagar has even more energy in print than in person.  Some of the artists were quite articulate and thoughtful, while some were not.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest surprise was from rock and roll bad guy himself - Alice Cooper.  Alice is a strong Christian family man with a great outlook on his life and his role.  He has some really funny quotes about having to live down some of his reputation.  He thinks God must have a sense of humor to use him.<br /><br />The book is written well, and the interviews themselves are pretty much as said, with all the poor grammar and colorful phrases kept it (although often \\"bleeped\\").  Overall a fun book and a good look inside the music on an important topic.	2004-08-31

This is first book I have read by Alton Gansky, but based on how much I enjoyed this one it will not be the last.  I picked it up to use some time on an airplane flight recently and was so captured by the story I quickly finished it from home.<br /><br />The book starts with a discovery of a building under thousands of feet of ice in Antarctica, which was just a coincidence given that the research team was there to try and understand why an underground (under ice?) lake was expanding.  So, from the outset you are wondering which direction the book would take?  Global warming?  UFO discovery?  Scientific exploration?<br /><br />I will not spoil the plot further by giving away the story, but suffice it to say that you will enjoy the book.  The main characters are depicted with some depth to give the story realism and the action and suspense never stop.  By combining ancient religious beliefs, modern technology and discovery into secret societies and infiltration all the way to the White House, it has all the makings of a great mystery thriller.  You can't ask for more than that.  Well written, and enjoyable.  When is the movie coming?	2004-08-28

A company with values.	I love Clif Bars, especially the \\"carrot cake\\" flavor!  When I saw this book by the CEO and founder of the company, I picked it up right away.  It is always insightful to read about people who founded or run companies and get an inside look at how they built the organization and what they value.  Where most business books focus on financials, strategy and how to be successful in their market, it is rarer to find a company that has been very successful financially while still placing their values as a higher priority than the profit-at-all-costs culture that plagues many organizations.<br /><br />The book describes in detail the founding of the company, from the almost storybook beginnings in his moms kitchen.  What started as a desire to create a \\"sports bar\\" that didn't taste like dirt, has turned into a quality and well known brand. While these types of rags to riches stories may be sounding familiar, this path is actually quite different.  Gary describes his passions for biking, travel and climbing, and how he has learned to value the environment and focus his company on sustainable growth. When his competitors were becoming part of large conglomerates with the resources to outspend and out market his brand, he resisted the lure of millions to sell the company and chose to remain private.<br /><br />I found myself marking pages, pondering quotes, and admiring the spirit and values that Gary brought to the organization.  He describes the difference between the \\"red path\\" and the \\"white path\\".  Developed through an analogy of taking roads less traveled, and traveling light on his numerous bike trips in Europe, he discovers that the real joy is in the journey not the destination. Those who take the \\"white path\\" play it safe, and make the kinds of business decisions that accountants love.  Those who take the \\"red path\\" stay true to their values, and must sometimes take risks others would fear to do in order to ensure the vision is upheld.<br /><br />For those who enjoy business strategy, the book contains plenty.  The steps to business sustainability and the values of hiring the right people and creating the right culture for employees are outlined and described.  Also, like Howard Shultz and a few others, Gary chooses to be honest about his doubts, his mistakes, and his fears.  In this way, the book is more inspiring than the typical academic and controlled business planning tools most consultants and business leaders use to replace passion and leadership.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly.  If you feel there is something missing in your company, and the workplace has become an unending and unsatisfying grind, then prepare to be inspired and encouraged.  It is refreshing to know that there are still business leaders who understand that life is more than their balance sheet.  A great example of a company willing to give back to the community and try to make the world a better place.  A company and a leader who not only believe their employees have inherent value as human beings, but treat them as such.e who enjoy business strategy, the book contains plenty.

What a fun book!  It is basically a children's book, one that I will read to my own kids.  Wonderfully illustrated and with a look at Cub players from \\"A to Z\\".  All the greats are here including Banks, Williams, Kessinger, Sosa, Sandberg, Jenkins, Wood, Prior, and even the late Harry Carey.<br /><br />Growing up a Cubs fan, there is always something special and magical about this team. Of course they never win anything, but like an old-timer said in an interview outside of Wrigley after the Cubs lost in game 5 of the NLCS last year:  \\"They wouldn't be the Cubs if they didn't break your heart!\\"<br /><br />If you are a Cubs fan then this a great book for you.

It is the story of four young men who set out on a journey around the world.  They visit Mexico, and Latin America, Russia, South Africa, India, Bangladesh, and Thailand.  Along the way they journal their adventures, and thoughts about what it means to see their faith in action in different parts of the world.<br /><br />The book gives some wonderful depictions of life in some of the 3rd world countries.  I have been deeply impacted by the care of the neglected and deformed children in Calcutta.  I could not read those stories about the way the children would hug them and the selfless care provided to them by the Sisters without tearing up.  We live in a world so far removed from the kind of suffering and poverty seen throughout this book, that it made me feel grateful, but mostly shameful at where I choose to focus my time and energy.  I have come to realize that I am not doing what is needed in the world, and I need to get closer to understanding what to do as a result of this awareness.<br /><br />If a book inspires me to re-think my life, and my purpose, then it has been a worthwhile read indeed.  I thank these young men for sharing their journey.<br /><br />A couple reviews pointed to the fact that sometimes the issues these young men struggled with were glossed over and some of the real value that could have been shared about their personal differences, philosophies and the theological struggles they had could have been very beneficial.  I agree.  At times, just when an issue was raised, it was dropped to describe something else.  The book was a bit too shallow and poorer for it.<br /><br />That said, I recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in serving abroad.  I was deeply impacted and that is the highest praise I can give any book.	2004-08-18
US	49850969	RXKLECYSXLOR2	1578566339	757729318	Directed Verdict	Books	5	57	61	N	N	A Grisham style legal thriller, only deeper and better.	Randy Singer has a style that is similar to John Grisham, with legal issues developed into in a novel.  However, this book has more twists and turns, multiple plot lines, and tackles deeper issues than greed.  The basic premise is about a woman who wants to sue the government of Saudi Arabia for the torture and death of her husband by their police.  A lawyer and his new aid attempt to take on more than just a powerful government.  This brings up international law issues, as well as issues of faith.<br /><br />I found it hard to put the book down, and was racing to the end.  The characters are well defined, although the antagonists are perhaps a bit one-dimensional.  The best aspect of the book is the compelling storyline, and the plot twists that are unexpected and keep the reader guessing.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who likes legal thrillers and good novels that are fun escapes.  Despite the fact that Randy Singer is not well known yet, with books as good as this one that deserves to change.	2004-08-14

I was consistently impacted while reading it, not so much that the material is brand new, but that it is presented in such a way that the opportunities and misses of my own interactions were obvious.<br /><br />One of the topics discussed is called \\"Mineral Rights\\", a type of conversation designed to get deep, past the surface and into the truth of what is going on.  The approach accomplishes four purposes:  Interrogate reality, provoke learning, tackle tough challenges, and enrich relationships.  It has been my experience that this rarely happens in corporate America, and is rarer still where I work now.  The book uses examples from various companies that have identified their core values and been honest enough with themselves and others to start acting on them.  The many questions posed throughout the book, and the sections at the end of each chapter are a great way to start interrogating reality in your workplace.  The answers usually are \\"in the room\\" if we can really get honest and start looking for them.<br /><br />In addition to some great business council, much of the book focuses on how we get honest with ourselves.  Often we are the problem, and our own inability to truly understand where our own issues lie, is an essential journey to better facilitate the kind of change we want in our business or relationships.  Another great approach used is the \\"Decision Tree\\" to help build empowerment in others.  Communicate clearly what decisions can be made and what must be communicated to others.  (Page 252).  Her insights into how silence is an effective communication tool, both internally and in interactions with others, were right on.<br /><br />While this was all excellent, and perhaps the most well written summary of engaging communication approaches, what was the most powerful for me were the sections on our \\"emotional wake\\".  We all leave an emotional wake behind us as we engage in conversations with people.  The question is, what kind of wake do we want to leave?  How do we want people to feel?  This served as a great wake up call for me while reading.<br /><br />Overall, this book is so full of great wisdom and insights I couldn't begin to do it justice here.  From the opening examples to the very useful questions in the back and the study guides throughout, I believe this to be one of the best books on business and personal communication I have read.  It is both deep and practical, both academically sound and real world tested, and is written in such a way that it felt like a conversation itself.

Now What?: How to Break Through Any Relationship Stalemate	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Use six questions to improve relationship communication	This book is about how to ask six questions, and use the answers to better communicate with our partner and improve a variety of relationship issues. The six questions are:<br /><br /> 1. What are my negative feelings?<br /><br /> 2. What's the fairest way to describe the problem?<br /><br /> 3. Why do I want to work things out?<br /><br /> 4. How would I like things between us to be?<br /><br /> 5. How can I actually get that?<br /><br /> 6. And if that doesn't work, what else can I do?<br /><br /> The authors use this approach with dozens of individuals who are in relationships and are having issues with each other related to everything from raising the kids, to ex-spouses, to sex, to money. In fact there are 16 chapters essentially showing how this approach works in a variety of situations.<br /><br /> I have no doubt that this does work. Rather than solving the issue however, these questions and this approach are really about how to compromise with the other person in the relationship, take ownership for &quot;my&quot; side of the problem, and improve communication clarity and understanding. My only concern with this book is that it is like reading a screenplay versus watching the film, or reading the sheet music versus hearing the symphony. Both are accurate depictions of the same reality, yet one fails to really capture the deeper passion and emotions as clearly as the other. The authors work hard at never making any moral decisions, and assume all situations can be simply resolved through this approach. The book is a logic first, logic last and only logic approach. Life is much richer than that though, and improved communication and compromise gets one only so far when there are deeper issues.<br /><br /> If this book is viewed as simply a useful tool for helping open doors to those tough issues we often procrastinate on or are reluctant to address for fear of conflict, then I highly recommend it. The process of getting our thoughts out in a rational way is always helpful in better understanding what lies at the heart of these issues.in better understanding what lies at the heart of these issues.  <br />	2004-08-01

When you think about a huge volcano on a Dutch colony in the West Indies, you expect a book full of exciting tales of geological events and catastrophic disaster.  The book has such gems, and gives an insight into the personal day to day lives of those impacted in a way that is so detailed, you are sure he must be making it up.  How could we possibly know such detail?<br /><br />The middle section of this book is superb.  It gives insight into the disaster itself and how those in the region could have ignored the warning signals.  The detail around the geologic changes and the historical importance is really incredible.<br /><br />However, the rest of the book seems at times almost unrelated.  The author goes off on tangents that last for pages.  For example, I now know more about the early pepper trade than I ever wanted to know.  I know about shipping lanes, and lawn parties, and all manners of historical bric-a-brac that is quite interesting, but detracts from the story I bought the book for.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that this book is a really worthwhile read, even if it does wander around to a degree seldom seen.  The history comes alive, and the author writes in a conversational tone, and one that matches the idyllic life on the islands.  Slow, easy, and in no hurry at all. That style may have cost this review one star, but as you will read in the book, it likely cost many people on the islands a great deal more.	2004-07-31

This is one of those books that is just too hard to put down. Thankfully for me, I need these types of books because I read while on the treadmill at the gym. I got some very long workouts in while finishing this one off!<br /><br /> Mark Taylor, the lead character, is an ex-marine now working for a television show in LA. One day he gets a call to interview the number one terrorist on the world. (A fictional character based on Osama Bin Laden) In 24 hours he has to fly around the world and into Syria to interview this man. At once he is approached by the CIA. If they can infiltrate his crew they may have a shot to take out the terrorist and save lives. Mark has to decide if he will risk his life to go along with their plan, and at the same time lose his career as a journalist. That very evening his wife gets some news that cannot wait - and will change his life. All of this is just in the first couple of chapters.<br /><br /> The book is written in real time, quickly jumping back and forth from America and Syria. What was a bit surreal was to be reading it and then glancing up at the TV sets and seeing &quot;war on terror&quot; scrolling across the bottom of CNN. The book is fast paced, and non-stop. On top of the thriller aspects and the suspense are the heart of the theological issues behind the Islamic Jihad against the west.<br /><br /> This one is a great story. You may find it a bit too contrived in moments, but will likely be too caught up in the story to notice. Highly recommended, just be sure you have some time to finish it once you pick it up.	2004-07-26

Bob Briner writes a book that needs to be read by everyone who wants to live out their Faith in the world. Churches, which are known for supporting the mission trips of members, all but ignore the opportunity to make a difference in key areas of our culture. It's not limited to churches, Christian universities and colleges are neither leading the charge in key areas such as journalism, film, arts, and music, or even equipping others to do so.<br /><br /> The basic premise of this book is that we are called to be &quot;salt and light&quot; in the world, and are instead often just sitting on the sidelines having abandoned the opportunity for a spiritual influence in music, films, TV, and the arts. The church has become nothing more than a sub culture producing work by us, for us, and to us. Little of this work transcends the boundary and makes its way into mainstream consciousness. This is not only a missed opportunity, but is directly opposed to what we are called to do.<br /><br /> The typical Christian reaction to Hollywood is to protest and speak out against some of the trash that is produced. While many of these films and TV shows are little more than advertisements for violence and moral depravity, and deserve the negative reactions they receive, where is the alternative? Where are the Christian men and women in Hollywood? Where are the films and TV shows that uplift family values and glorify God? While there are some examples, they are few and far between. The saying &quot;nature abhors a vacuum&quot; applies to the evil present in much of what Hollywood produces. When we abandon the culture we live in, and create our own separate subculture, the result is that the values shown in the films will be filled in by those whose own beliefs contradict the Gospel message of Love, Grace, and Hope.<br /><br /> Bob Briner sends a powerful message. It is needed and applauded. Stop complaining and start making a difference! Those who graduate from college and head off into professions like music, art, and media, need our support. It takes a lot of courage to swim against the current. It's time we start getting involved personally or at least supporting those who do, if we truly want to be &quot;salt and light&quot;.off into professions like music, art, and media, need our support.

While other books are more in depth on the story itself, this one focuses primarily on the leadership styles used at various parts of journey.<br /><br /> What is good about this book is that it puts to rest the idea that leadership cannot be delivered with different styles under adverse conditions. Shackleton uses teamwork, reverse psychology, motivation, direction, listening and a host of other leadership traits to get his crew to safety. He demonstrates &quot;servant leadership&quot; when it matters most.<br /><br /> A great story which will keep you captivated, and some wonderful leadership lessons for use in all conditions.

If you are unfamiliar with this series, please start there.<br /><br /> This book suffers from the &quot;Two Towers&quot; syndrome, meaning that no matter how good it is it remains the middle of the story, which leaves the reader feeling somewhat less satisfied than the first and last books. That said, the book is outstanding. The first surprise occurs in the first dozen or so pages, where we find the lead character - Thomas Hunter - living a completely different life than where we left him. It seems that a decade or so has passed in one world, and I had to work to keep up and try and figure out the transition. However, we quickly jump back to the split second where the first book left off, and slowly the pieces come together.<br /><br /> This book is much darker than the first one, and is reminiscent of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; where the good guys mostly struggle and evil takes a hold. As always, the writing is crisp and the story so compelling that I read the book cover to cover in a couple of sittings, due solely to time constraints. Had I had the time, I would have read it all in one sitting, it is that engaging.<br /><br /> I can?t wait for &quot;White&quot; (the third and last of the series) to be released to see the payoff, but so far this is an outstanding series and a welcome addition to the genre.

The realization that our lives are impacted by regrets, &quot;if only's&quot; and guilt is hardly a new concept, but it is presented very logically and clearly here.<br />Les starts with some insights into how our regrets for things done, or more impactfully those things not done, can have a dramatic influence on how we view our present.  Perhaps there are no more powerful influences that affect us than those we carry around with us everyday.  To some degree, all of us are affected by how we later interpret our actions and inactions in relationships and work.  Sometimes these decisions haunt us decades later, and keep us from acting today.<br />The book is broken into chapter topics, and includes quizzes, assessments, study questions and examples.  If motivated, I think that one could get some pretty profound insights into current behavioral patterns by just completing the self assessments and becoming more aware of how much we really are defined at times by things we ought to let go of and move on.  The section on guilt is outstanding, and is presented in a manner which is easily understood. One key is differentiating between the guilt that is valid and requires action, and false guilt which serves to keep us from doing what is needed to build relationships and experience life more fully.<br />The book is written well, in a conversational tone.  For me, it really did feel conversational as I took classes from Les at SPU and have spoken with him on enough occasions to &quot;hear&quot; him while reading. The concepts are not new, and ironically I was working through them when I met Les nearly 14 years ago.  I am reminded of one of the promises of working the 12 steps in AA which states:  &quot;we will neither regret the past, nor wish to shut the door on it.  We will realize that no matter how far down the scale we have gone, our experiences can benefit others.&quot;  This speaks to the serenity and peace that is the outcome of many of the same actions Les recommends here.  Forgiving others, making amends, learning to live &quot;one day at a time&quot; in the present.<br />This book is excellent, and I will recommend it to others.  Like Les, I would only hope each person really uses it to free themselves from unnecessary burdens and regrets.  Life is a wonderful journey, and is often hard enough without the extra baggage we haul around related to guilt and regret.  This book will help one take the first steps towards becoming free from the binding regret and guilt of our past actions, and start living better today.his speaks to the serenity and peace that is the outcome of many of the same actions Les recommends here.

Ted Dekker has yet again delivered with a story that simply won't let you go.  The book starts out a bit slow, and is often hard to follow as we are taken along with the lead character, Thomas Hunter, between modern day Denver and a strange world that at first appears to be a dream.<br />Slowly the two worlds become more entwined and harder to determine what is real and what is a dream.<br />The pacing and structure of the story reminds me of some of Terry Brooks books, namely the &quot;Magic Kingdom: For Sale&quot; series.  Consider this trilogy a tribute to the late, great, CS Lewis as it is a wonderful allegory of the Christian story, but with a nod to modern day authors like Brook's or even Stephen King.  Like the CS Lewis classic Narnia series, time does not correlate between the two worlds, allowing for the storylines to intersect in some really fascinating ways.<br />One warning, do not buy this book unless you are prepared to buy all three.  So tantalizing is this cliffhanger that I had to run out that day and purchase the second book, and start that one.  Now I have to wait for the third.<br />A well done and well written book.  If you are not a fan of science-fiction or thrillers then this book may not appeal to you, but if you are it is an impossible to put down page turner.	2004-07-16

Who would have thought that a book on punctuation would be interesting?  Amazingly though it is.  I picked up a copy to skim through, figuring it would sit on the shelf like a dictionary, and actually started reading it.  If you can make a subject like this interesting, you have talent as a writer.<br />I think the best aspects are the humor used to describe the value of punctuation.  Leno used to do some very funny bits about signs and advertising that sent a very different message than intended, and this book also uses some of those types of examples.  Does punctuation make a difference?  Of course, and this book is a wonderful, and funny, tool to review to help better use punctuation to improve ones communication ability.<br />It will be interesting to see how this content merges with sub-languages that are developing on email, internet chat boards, and text messaging.  Now, can we update MS Word to use these kinds of fun suggestions when editing documents?	2004-07-09

The author writes with a natural and flowing style that brings to life a childhood filled with the kind of everyday bumps and spills that are both hopeful and sad at the same time.<br />This is a book that goes everywhere and nowhere.  While the family and situations are depicted with a harsh reality that grabs the reader, and hooks you into the emotion, by the end of the book you are simply glad it is not your life.  I found it ultimately to be just depressing.  The childhood scenes are wonderful, but the promise of the future contained within is never fulfilled.  Realistic I suppose, but not a lot of fun to read about.<br />No question that David is a talented writer, and has a great style, but I guess I missed the point here.  5 stars for a wonderfully written book, but minus a few for the fact that the book really doesn't go anywhere except to jab at anything doesn't fully embrace the lost and meaningless lifestyle depicted here.	2004-07-04

I was given a copy of this book by my wonderful wife Michelle for this most recent Father's Day.  I picked it up to skim through and despite having loads of work to do, read nearly the whole thing without slowing down.  It is an encouraging and meaningful collection of wisdom on how to align our personal attitudes towards an often hostile environment.<br />There are ten basic &quot;paradoxical commandments&quot;, which start with a realistic, although perhaps overly jaded, view of others.  For example, the first &quot;commandment&quot; is &quot;People are illogical, unreasonable, and self centered - Love them anyway&quot;.  That is the general point to all of these, do what is right anyway.<br />What is really interesting is the path these &quot;paradoxical&quot; statements took.  The author was amazed to find that something he had written 20 years before in college wound up on the wall at Mother Theresa's orphanage in Calcutta.  What a surprise it was for him to see these listed in one of her memoirs, knowing that something you wrote was held in that high of esteem by someone as wonderfully selfless as she was.<br />My personal favorite is the section on &quot;Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable - Be honest and frank anyway&quot;.  In corporate America, there is often little reward, and much risk in being honest what with the always present threat or perception of politics and other power struggles in play.  Yet, it has been shown time and again that an honest and frank discussion of the &quot;current state&quot; is the first step towards growth and development - of people or the business.  This brief text gives encouragement to do the right thing, knowing full well the short term consequences may be painful.  Kent gave some great examples of this, including being literally fired for one of his presentations which was simply an admonition to improve.<br />Sure, this book is merely a rehashing of wisdom one finds in Proverbs, or elsewhere in the Bible and other philosophical sources, but it is very worthwhile nonetheless.  I recommend keeping a copy on your desk or nightstand for a simple and concise reality check when needed.  Do the right thing, because it is the right thing to do, and despite the reality of the world - do it \\"Anyway\\".and other philosophical sources, but it is very worthwhile nonetheless.

I picked up this book based on the title, which emphasizes &quot;winning&quot; with today's &quot;free agent&quot; workforce.  I presumed this meant the focus would be attracting the right kind of talent, and keeping those people engaged.  To be fair, the book does get into the concept of cultural fit and motivation, but does so in a way which will appeal to a limited audience.<br />Like many, I am a sports fan, and often use analogies of team sports to make leadership or team work comparisons in the workplace.  However, I am careful to not overuse these, as many are not interested in team sports and may not relate.  This book is all about sports.  Literally.  Every page relates business leadership concepts to sports figures, in every major sport.  Often this works to make his points, but it is simply too much in my opinion.  The leadership concepts get lost in what often reads more like Sports Illustrated, than a business leadership book.<br />The concepts themselves are sound.  These include discussions on &quot;urgency of engagement&quot;, &quot;team chemistry&quot;, &quot;talent assessment&quot;, &quot;goal setting&quot; and more.  In particular the author does a wonderful job of stressing the balance of home grown talent, and external hires.  However, if we boiled this book down to just the leadership aspects, without the sports, it would be about 20 pages long.  What is left is sometimes quite insightful, and always sound wisdom on leadership, but you can see just where the focus is.  If you are a die hard sports fan, the kind of person who watches ESPN all day regardless of what is on, then this is the book for you.  You will relate to the analogies, and the leadership tips and discussions are excellent.  If you are not a sports fan, you may want to try a different source.<br />The book is well written, flows smoothly, and never dry.  The &quot;study questions&quot; at the end of each chapter are also excellent.  Perhaps a title which links this book more directly to sports would allow for clearer expectations up front.  Some good insights, but may not be accessible to a diverse audience.irectly to sports would allow for clearer expectations up front.

I have been a big Terry Brooks fan since first reading the &quot;Sword of Shannara&quot; nearly 25 years ago.  His writing style has been often criticized, but mostly due to unfair comparisons with JRR Tolkien, although it is unlikely anyone writing in the same genre would stand up to the legend.  That said Brooks deserves much credit for his accomplishments.  His books never fail to deliver.<br />What is different about this endeavor is that it is not fiction, but rather reads like a friendly conversation about his writing style and the process he uses to write his stories.  I was captivated and encouraged by how he uses some simple and straightforward techniques, including outlining, to put his ideas onto paper.<br />I have been thinking of several books that are just waiting to be written, and am inspired by his insights and encouragement to take a few risks and just get started.<br />A very interesting read, and an insightful look behind the scenes.  Equal parts talent, writing ability, hard work and luck enabled Terry Brooks to get to the top and stay there for twenty years.  No reason why it cannot happen to someone else.  I recommend this book to anyone who has been a fan of his work, or is thinking of writing themselves.	2004-06-26

Considering the terrorism of 9-11, and the current situation in the middle-east, Islam has been widely discussed, in terms which often fail to provide any real insight into the basis for the actions of a few, and the beliefs of many.<br />This book is a fast read, and flows smoothly, and is never dry.  It combines some good academic overviews and thesis about the Qur'an, and how its words align with the actions of Islamic people, both those who seek peace, and those who wish to wage war on &quot;infidels&quot; who do not follow the teachings.<br />One of the most fascinating sections was the rich depiction of Islamic history, and the scientific and cultural impacts made in the middle ages.  The history is colorful and deep, and I had been unaware of the many contributions to society and how impactful it was.  The book is worth reading for this background alone.<br />The real discussion is of course whether the core beliefs of Islam support the terrorism and often clear violations of human rights that westerners take for granted.  A glimpse into the truth behind this question is provided by Sa'id Raja'i-Khorassani, the Iran delegate to the United Nations who stated in 1985 &quot;the very concept of human rights was a Judeo-Christian invention and inadmissible in Islam&quot; (page 104).  While often the politically-correct focus of western media seeks to avoid any direct correlations of violent actions and their link to the core tenets of Islam, the link is nonetheless clear.<br />According to the book, the Qur'an states that &quot;Muhammad is God's Apostle. Those who follow him are ruthless to unbelievers but merciful to one another&quot; (Sura 48:29).  The Qur'an further enjoins &quot;Believers. Make war on the infidels who dwell around you.  Deal firmly with them.  Know that God is with the righteous&quot;  (Sura 9:123).  There is simply no place in the Qur'an which extols one to &quot;love thy neighbor as thyself&quot; or &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; as in the New Testament.  Therefore whether it is the Taliban, or Bin Laden, they do in fact appear have the support of their Holy Book, without any condemnation of their actions.<br />The book makes many such arguments, and does so in what appears to be a very objective and well documented fashion.<br />While I personally hold that most Islamic people are not living to wage war on those who are not followers of Mohammad, there are certainly many who do, and it would appear that this is supported by the core tenets of their faith.<br />The book is a fascinating look at an often misunderstood belief system.  The book has hundreds of sources quoted and is well documented.  Well written and interesting throughout.s thyself&quot; or &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; as in the New Testament.

Despite the fact that this book had the potential to be dry and overly academic, it never is.  From the opening personal background, to the depiction of his journalistic assignment to cover a debate on school textbooks in rural West Virginia, to the &quot;conversational&quot; tone to his presentation of scientific evidence from the experts, the book is always readable and engaging.<br />This is a well written overview to the fact that science and faith are not as mutually exclusive as we have been led to believe.  In fact, much scientific evidence clearly points to a Creator.  Whether it is big-bang cosmology, or the complexity of the bio-chemical process, design is everywhere.  However, this is only part of the story.  The book starts with first punching holes in most of the famous Darwin and Evolution &quot;icons&quot; which prompted Lee to abandon a belief in God to begin with.<br />That the famous &quot;Haeckel&quot; embryo drawings are faked and have been known as such for decades, has not kept them from being included in modern textbooks to show evidence for Darwin's theories.  The amount of liberty that has been taken with weak arguments for macro-evolution points to a naturalistic philosophy, not scientific evidence, which is driving much of what passes for scientific study in the area of origins of life.  See the book &quot;Icons of Evolution&quot; for a deeper look.<br />The chapter on \\"the Evidence of Consciousness\\" is in itself worth buying the book.  J.P. Moreland and others discuss whether a computer will someday have \\"spiritual\\" experiences, and look into the scientific origins of philosophy made famous by Rene Decartes. The debate as to whether our consciousness is a result of mere physical brain activity which reaches a certain level, or is evidence of something beyond the physical, is a fascinating discussion.<br />I highly recommend this book.  It is a wonderful introduction to scientific evidence from renowned scientists with impeccable credentials that align science with faith in a way that is both logically and rationally sound. While I agree that he could have interviewed a wider range of people, the theories and works from non-theists like Robert Gould, Richard Dawkins, and others are well presented. It is also a great place to start research on the subject, as there are dozens of works sited and noted from William Demski, Michael Behe, William Lane Craig, Stephen Hawking, and others.

Bob Briner has, in his final effort, sent a message that every Christian should read.<br />The essence of the book is about how we as Christians have failed to be &quot;salt and light&quot; and become at best irrelevant in our society today.  In the first chapter he come right out with a direct and as bold a statement you can make:  WE are the problem!  He makes the following statement that gets to the heart of the way we are often depicted in society.  &quot;One simple way to understand the lesson of God's Kingdom and to see very clearly how we have failed our world is to understand that the Christian's job is NOT to change society, or to clean up its institutions.  Rather it is to offer the life-changing, heart-changing, power of the Gospel.&quot; (Page 22).  Bob describes with numerous examples how many of the &quot;Christian Leaders&quot; have damaged the wonderfully powerful and needed good their organizations do by getting sidetracked into political issues which merely marginalized their message and alienated people in the process.  Included are &quot;Focus on the Family&quot; and Chuck Colson's \\"Prison Fellowship\\" organizations.<br />What is so convicting about this book is how true it is, and yet how strongly I often found myself resisting it with &quot;yeah but...&quot; time and again.  However, the more I pondered his message, the more sense it makes.  While his points are right on, I think that we are called often to be leaders for change.  What the Reverend Martin Luther King did was a needed and valued catalyst for some institutional change.  At times this is needed I believe.  However, Bob's point is that we need focus first on BEING people for whom the world will look to for answers to uncertainty, not because of what we say or how we judge others, but rather for the way in which we live and reach out to others.<br />This is an inspiring book, and a must read for all Christians.  He discusses our failures in media, music and journalism, which are all areas of huge influence that Christians have largely abandoned and now either seem to create an exclusive sub-culture of and for ourselves, or sit meekly on the sidelines and attack that which we abandoned in the first place.  We have missed opportunity after opportunity to credibly impact our world in these areas, by being exclusive or being judgmental, instead of being involved.  One need only look at the life of Jesus Christ to see how powerfully he changed society through the hearts and minds of those he loved, and by not only going to, but being with, the very people whom many modern western Christians have abandoned.  Whether it is racism, or the often shameful attacks on homosexuals under the name of Christ, we have missed the point and done more harm than good.  Where is the loud and direct outrage at the signs shown by supposed Christians at the funeral of Matthew Sheppard?  This is but one example of the fact that we have let others label us, and depict us all due to the actions of a few.<br />I encourage you to read this book.  Whether you are a Christian who wants to make a difference, or a non-Christian who sees the faith as hostile and intolerant, Bob has captured and presented a message of truth that will change the way you view the role of a Christian in the world.ans.

The stories are wonderfully written and will engage you like few other works.  Part spiritual allegory and part fantasy and adventure, these stories are timeless.<br />My personal favorite of the 7 stories is this one:  The Silver Chair.  Starting with the unexpected trip into Narnia, the story involves the search for a missing prince and a dangerous and exciting journey to find him.  While the plot is quickly engaging and always enjoyable, even after dozens of readings, in this story Lewis uses some of the most powerful of Christian allegories to depict faith, deception, and courage.  Choices made along the way are often disastrous and are the result of convenience and comfort over faith.  Truly a sound statement into our own journeys, and a spiritual struggle depicted accurately.<br />I will not spoil the plot, but if you have not enjoyed this series, pick up any of the seven books, or better yet get them all at once.  The story starts either with \\"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" which was the first published, or \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" which is chronologically the first.  Either way, you won't be disappointed.  Next to \\"The Silver Chair\\", I also found \\"The Horse and His Boy\\" and \\"Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\" to be absolute classics.<br />Buy this series, and enjoy one of the true treasures in literature from a fabulous writer, the world renowned CS Lewis.	2004-05-17

The book contains 37 two to three page essays by some of the best and most well known of human resources and organizational leaders and pioneers.  From Stephen Cover to Dave Ulrich, from Marshall Goldsmith to Robert Eichenger, these individuals have done much to shape current thought in the areas of organizational development and leadership.<br />The book is divided into eight different categories, including what were in my opinion the most insightful; &quot;Unlearning what you thought was so&quot;, &quot;Pain is a great teacher&quot;, and &quot;Seeing yourself as others do&quot;.  What makes this such an interesting read is that all these short essays within the eight topic areas reflect very personal insights into the people themselves.  What events helped them learn and grow, what successes, or failures, helped them become who they are today?<br />We are given a rare glimpse into some very real personal experiences, in which we all can relate on some level.  I was struck time and again at just how &quot;normal&quot; these leaders are, and behind the names, the publications, and the prestige of being well known and a leader in your field, are some remarkable stories of struggle and perseverance.<br />Highly recommended, but not for the organizational wisdom or business tips, but rather for the humanity and depth of the personal testimonies.  We can all benefit from the wisdom of others whose own lessons learned can be encouraging and timely regardless of where you may be on your own journey.	2004-05-09

If you have even a passing interest in Christianity, but struggle to know what to do with the often conflicting behaviors exhibited by many who claim to all be following the same basic belief system, then this book is an excellent look at what it could and should be.  How is it that the message of the Gospel is often acted out on a stage for the benefit of our own ego?<br />Brennan Manning has an uncanny ability to sift through the surface, and dive straight into the places we often do not want to acknowledge exist within all of us.  In this book he tackles the \\"image conscious\\" Christian, more concerned with how they look, than what they are doing.  In it he exposes just how far off the message of love and peace we have often gone.  With all of our masks, pettiness, vanity and ego we consume ourselves with, where is our focus on our true cause; to love God and love our neighbor as ourselves?<br />Of particular interest is how he manages to be blunt and direct in many very personal ways, yet all in his usual self effacing style which leaves one motivated not judged.  When reading Manning, one is left with the overwhelming sense that they are simply in a conversation with someone who is speaking on their level.  While I know a few too distracted with dogma and doctrine to understand his perspective, he writes about the very real struggle to let go of ego and image, and focus on what is really important.  His looks into the problems of racism, homophobia, and neglect of the poor among Christians are especially powerful considering they contrast so much with loving and reaching out to others as Jesus did.<br />Although the editing and copy itself is at times a bit distracting with its multi-type fonts on every page, it does allow you to take bite sized bits of information and ponder the meaning behind it.  Rarely have I stopped so many times while reading to reflect on my own issues.  An excellent read and good insights!	2004-05-08

Michael Treacy sets out to show that growth, double digit growth at that, is possible in every economic environment.  This is of course a creative possibility, but is often not acknowledged or even sought after by many in corporate America who are content to do the easy risk-avoidance strategies which ensure their ultimate demise.  I liked this quote early in the book to set the tone:  &quot;Why do many managers preside over no-growth organizations without confronting the reality that accepting the status quo is the business equivalent of committing suicide?&quot;<br />The highlights of the book are the way the ideas are laid out and then described in action with examples across several industries.  Some of the tactics include; Spread the risk, Take small bites, Balance your strategies, and Commit to superior value.  One key according to Treacy is to accept that growth is a choice.  He describes managers talking about growth difficulties as &quot;a little like listening to an addict in denial. Don't they understand that growth is a choice - a choice that lies entirely within their power and no one else's?&quot; (Page 17).<br />Treacy covers 5 disciplines; Improving customer base retention; Market share gain; Market positioning; Penetrating adjacent markets; New lines of business.  While these are certainly solid examples of the ways to approach growth, the real depth in the book is around understanding consumer behavior.  He points out the reality behind why most &quot;customer retention&quot; strategies don't work, and how to increase &quot;switching costs&quot; of your products and services.  Making your products and services &quot;sticky&quot; is a key to growth working well, by retaining current customers while attracting new ones.<br />While the information and theories here are certainly not the final word on growth, this book should be required reading for all the corporate &quot;victims&quot; blaming their woes on things outside their control.  It is clear that countless opportunities exist within every market niche and through every economic trend to facilitate growth.  Many companies do in fact continue to grow, and they are usually ones who are committed to it.  The companies that do not grow are usually gone in time.  The section on Corning, caught in the euphoria of the late 90's telecom boom, was a great example of how even market leaders fail to get ahead of the indicators and lose as a result.<br />Overall, a great read, with some good insights.  I would have liked to see a bit more focus on the inspirational factors that great leaders bring to align their employees to deliver when the employees themselves may not see the way.  That is obviously a huge key to executing a strategy, and was not covered as in depth as it could have been here.  Otherwise, a good look at how to achieve growth and will likely cause many light bulbs to go on while reading.that countless opportunities exist within every market niche and through every economic trend to facilitate growth.

This is a great way to start a dialog about the value of people.<br />This book, written by a team from the then famous, and now infamous, &quot;Arthur Anderson&quot;, includes the basic premise that people are a measurable asset, and like capital, should be looked at as an investment that can bring big returns.<br />The book is however surprisingly flat and dry.  If you have little business or financial experience and are a human resources professional, then this is a decently sound introduction to looking at people as a measurable part of a business performance criteria.  I really had no issue with the way the topic was laid out, or how they described the various stages needed to start a measurable process.  It was what the book lacked though that I found disappointing.<br />It reads like it was written by accountants.  Wait, I guess it was.  That said, I felt that the book lacked passion and inspiration.  When discussing people, and how to look at them for their potential, I expect more information that is aligned to psychology and motivation.  This book does not deliver that way.  I would predict that someone could do everything outlined in the book, and yet not achieve the results because of not &quot;what&quot; was presented, but &quot;how&quot;.<br />In the end people want to work for a cause, not just for a living (Soul of the Firm - ServiceMaster CEO).  Check out a few other books that are less technical, but will probably help get better results for your company including &quot;Leadership and Self Deception&quot;, and &quot;Theory R Management&quot;.	2004-04-20

If you remember the ABA, and loved the red, white and blue ball, the original 3-point line, and what it all brought to the game of basketball, then consider this required reading.<br />I cannot remember when I have laughed so hard while reading a documentary. The depictions of the players, and the unusual antics the owners tried to get people to come watch is simply too funny to describe here.  Whether it was making a big deal out of $100,000 contracts (really just &quot;very&quot; long annuities) or getting the whole crowd to move to one side of the arena (the side shown on TV) the league went to new lengths to promote the product.  Cow milking at halftime?  Whatever the means, there is no doubt that the ABA changed the game forever.  The first slam dunk contest, the 3-point line, and the creativity of the play itself were brand new.<br />While the league may have been a circus act compared to the classic NBA who had the Laker's, Celtic's, Wilt, Russell, West, Oscar and others, make no mistake that some of the best to ever play came not out of the NBA but the ABA.  Connie Hawkins was MJ long before MJ himself followed in the footsteps of another ABA great; Dr. J.  The ABA started the early college exodus with the legal decision \\"hardship\\" rule applied to the great Spencer Haywood.  If you think Rasheed Wallace with his 28 technicals a season is a strange act to follow, he pales in comparison with some of the bruisers in the &quot;other&quot; league.  One story about a player/coach, who had benched himself for fighting, ends with the coach putting himself in as a player and decking someone not 30 seconds into the game!  Who can forget the famous Marvin Barnes?  Here was a guy so talented he could arrive at the game 5 minutes before tip-off wearing nothing but his uniform and a full length mink coat and carrying a sack full of take out hamburgers.  His coach is so mad he benches him for the start of first quarter.  Marvin gets in the game, yet manages to pay his charter pilot from his checkbook during a time-out!  Final stat line for the game for the late arriving Barnes: 49 points and 19 rebounds.<br />If the stories and no-way-you-can-make-this-up depictions are not enough, then how about a chapter written by Bob Costas on his first assignment - the announcer for the ABA's &quot;Spirit's of St. Louis&quot;.  The chapter about the wild antics and totally undisciplined plays, including some of the classic on-air gaffes that Costas makes, will leave you laughing until your sides hurt.  Who can forget &quot;Fly&quot; Williams?  A street player so out of control he tried a 360 dunk on a fast break all by himself and ended up so spun around he threw the ball over the backboard.  It was a close game at that!<br />If you are at all a fan of basketball, you have to read this book.  10 stars!!rter pilot from his checkbook during a time-out!

US	49850969	R1QZR1Y2UN0EMY	0786883561	517056475	Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time	Books	5	104	106	N	N	You will never look at Starbucks the same way again	This is one of the best business biographies I have ever read.  It is truly inspiring.  One simple, and telling, output from reading this book on a plane was that as soon as we landed I headed to the local airport Starbucks for a latte.  I rarely even drink coffee!  So powerful are the imagery and the passion for coffee in his story that you can almost smell the roasted dark beans, feel them running through your fingers, hear the sounds of the espresso machine and taste the coffee itself!<br />Why is this imagery so important?  Because behind the corporate image of a relentless pac-man like machine churning out new locations at a rate slightly above the national birth rate it seems, is a simple vision of passion for coffee combined with Italian neighborhoods and a warm and friendly place where the worlds best coffee and social friendship intermix.  That is what Starbucks was all about.<br />The book itself is a remarkable insight into this journey.  It was even more special for me, as I grew up with Starbucks - literally.  When Howard talks about the vision he had to treat even his part time employees with full benefits and ownership in the company through stock, I know it was more than just a nice sounding corporate manta, it really worked.  Friends I went to high school with in Bellevue in the mid to late 1980's worked at the first stores, and raved about this little coffee company and couldn't imagine working anywhere else.  So, from firsthand experience I can tell you that what he says about the passion and vision coming to life in Seattle is all true<br />While company history is quite interesting, and the book itself just hums and glides without ever getting mundane, the real gems are in the emotional reality Howard displays.  He talks about being overwhelmed to tears, about the rejection he faced while trying to get funding for his fledgling company, about the naysayers and others who nearly took it all away, and the struggle with having a hand in everything and slowly letting go.  You know that you are reading about a real person, someone who came from a poor neighborhood in Brooklyn with working-class roots, not an image generated by a large corporations PR spin doctors<br />The value of people, so often lost in corporate bureaucracy, is evident here.  Starbucks grew because it struck an emotional chord with people.  He knew that in order for the company to be successful he needed people who shared the values.  This is often spoken of, and rarely practiced in the corporate world where systems, forecasts, processes and other such tools become the focal point, and the simple fact that all results come through people is lost.  He speaks throughout the book of people who helped him, coached him, mentored him, challenged him, and made the company what it was. One quote in particular summarizes his views:  &quot;If people relate to the company they work for, if they form an emotional tie to it and buy into its dreams, they will pour their heart into making it better.&quot; (Page 6) This theme comes through in every decision.<br />Overall, this is a wonderful book, and is truly inspiring.  I would work for him tomorrow, if it really still is the way it's portrayed here.  I encourage you to read this book and see your neighborhood Starbucks in a new light.and slowly letting go.

He attempts to look at past conflicts, Hitler's Nazi Germany for example, to demonstrate that there exists such a thing as \\"evil\\" and that it must be confronted directly and called for what it is.  He spends a great deal of time championing the causes of Reagan, Churchill and GW Bush, while blasting the non-action taken by Clinton or Carter.  It was on this attack of Carter I often strongly disagreed.  Jimmy Carter has proven to be a man of peace and has demonstrated perhaps the finest character of any former President.  While he often struggled politically in office, and that is surely open for criticism, the shots Hannity takes at Carter now are really missing the tremendous good Mr. Carter has done, and is doing in the world.<br />So while I think that the views expressed here are so one-sided that they are not all that meaningful, he does make some excellent points as well.  One of them is to expose the moral relativism of the liberal agenda here in America.  This morally bankrupt philosophy is not only devoid of reason, logic and common sense; it will continue to put America at a disadvantage in the war on terror.<br />For example, on page 46 he describes the typical liberal response to an act of evil, by saying \\"Even in the face of such evidence, the liberal elites still avoid using the word \\"evil\\".  For them, the term is too judgmental\\".  This is of course an accurate depiction of liberalism as it exists today.  However, Sean doesn't take the evidence to as strong a conclusion as Tammy Bruce does in \\"The Death of Right and Wrong\\".  Moral relativism is in fact a serious degradation in the moral character of our nation, but there are better presentations of this issue than what Sean postulates here.  For another look see \\"Moral Relativism:  Feet Firmly Planted in Mid-Air\\".<br />(...)	2004-03-28
US	49850969	R1972KW8CF7SO1	0553378589	253928041	Working with Emotional Intelligence	Books	5	62	68	N	N	Success is based on how you apply emotional intelligence	This is a wonderful book, and is truly an insightful look at what helps us to be successful in leadership positions in the workplace.  The old model of senior management was based on owning all the information and knowledge and being able to understand what everyone does in fine detail, and was often the &quot;promoted-up-through-the-ranks&quot; type of leader.  But with modern business involving so much change, and constantly shifting market demands and organizational structures, what worked well yesterday will not move the organization or your career ahead tomorrow.<br />The author uses as a platform the work on Emotional Intelligence, which unlike typically defined intelligence, focuses on the ability to apply emotional and inspirational information in a variety of social settings and through a vast array of relationships.  It is this ability he concludes that predicts success in today's workplace.<br />Among the areas of discussion are five competencies in which our ability is revealed. The first is &quot;Self Awareness&quot; which includes emotional awareness, self-assessment, and self-confidence. How many times have we worked for or with someone who could not control their emotions and lacked the self awareness to understand how their actions impacted those around them?  The importance of balancing performance while exhibiting the values of the organization through a positive culture has never been more in need. Many who have the intelligence to do the work, lack the emotional intelligence to build the relationships and culture needed to get the work done through others.  The book explores these pitfalls and discusses suggestions for change.<br />The other areas are similar: &quot;Self Regulation&quot; (self-control, trustworthiness, adaptability, innovation), &quot;Motivation&quot; (achievement driven, commitment, initiative, and optimism), &quot;Empathy&quot; (understanding others, developing others, service oriented, politically aware), and &quot;Social Skills&quot; (influence, conflict management, leadership, catalyst, building bonds, collaboration and cooperation, and teamwork).<br />All of the five competencies are presented well, with examples and suggestions for improvement.  Some reviewers have noted the lack of &quot;scientific&quot; type of analysis, but I feel that misses the point.  The first hurdle to overcome if one wants to be as successful as possible is a basic awareness of the importance of interpersonal skills, and building strong working relationships with others.  The opportunity for a purely autocratic style to operate in today's business is rare and therefore the majority of those leading businesses will need to focus on how they apply their EQ, not just their IQ.<br />This book does an excellent job at presenting what EQ success looks like and why it is important.  It is not a step by step manual for improving one's business success, as that would ironically be an IQ approach.  The book instead is a great eye-opener of the importance of emotions, and how we read others and interact with them.  Highly recommended, and a great starting point for improving your ability to lead others in today's business environment.ills&quot; (influence, conflict management, leadership, catalyst, building bonds, collaboration and cooperation, and teamwork). <br />All of the five competencies are presented well, with examples and suggestions for improvement.

US	49850969	RK05GYBT8XXEZ	0385510438	817294609	The Last Juror (Grisham, John)	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Ignore the title, there are hardly any lawyers in this one!	My wife Michelle bought this book for me recently, and judging by the title I sat down prepared to read another of Grisham's famous books about lawyers.  To my surprise, this one was very different.  It seems Grisham has branched out recently with the Painted House, and Bleachers, and that has given him a different writing style than the one he was famous for in the Firm, Pelican Brief, and others.<br />This book takes place in a small town in 1970's Mississippi, and centers on a young man who has taken over the local newspaper.  The young man is not form the area and therefore is an outsider to the community he writes his newspaper for.  The story flows with the slow steady pace of life in the Deep South, and is rich with detail and the mood of the time.  While not as quickly engaging as some of his lawyer books, this one has far more substance.<br />Grisham depicts the struggle with racism, the naivet&eacute; of youth, and the &quot;above the law&quot; clans of bootleggers and crooked police.  The best aspects of the story were the ways in which this 23 year old owner of the local newspaper has to learn the ropes.  Blessed with a youthful enthusiasm, yet to be tempered with wisdom, he finds himself in the eye of the storm.  When he prints news articles about the murder, and the accused, he suddenly finds himself center stage in a hotbed of corruption and a public trail he is seen to have influenced.<br />I won't spoil the plot any further, as this book is a great one to pick up and read cold.  Overall, I recommend this as a good departure from Grisham's usual formula.  If you liked a &quot;Painted House&quot; then I think you will find this book closer in style to that one.	2004-02-17

I was given a copy of this book by my sister Amy for Christmas this year.  I have two little daughters and she obviously understands the importance of a Dad in her life and wanted me to as well.<br />This is not a deep read, just photos and short bits of wisdom.  However, that's not to say it isn't emotionally resonating.  I had tears in my eyes while reading and thinking about the role I have in my two daughter's lives.  It is humbling and wonderful at the same time.<br />If you have daughters, or know someone who does, then this book is a simple reminder of the important role that fathers play in the healthy development of their female children.  A great coffee table, or end table, book to serve as a gentle reminder of the responsibility of caring for a daughter.	2004-02-15

This book was originally written in 1983, and then released again after the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" took off I presume.  Hey, nothing wrong with updating an old work to make some quick bucks on the coattails of someone else.  It worked on me; I picked up a 20 year old book which was on sale at the airport 5 days ago.  Not a bad job of marketing.<br />The book itself has on its acknowledgements page the following statement:  \\"About half the book is true.  It's up to the reader to figure out which half\\".  I think I did.  All of the physical locations sited in Italy and in the US are in fact real places.  The rest is nonsense.<br />I did enjoy the pacing of the story, and there was enough mindless \\"james bond-esque\\" types of action that it kept me entertained.  However, it reads like one of the poorer of the Bond films.  Think Roger Moore and his wise cracks and quirks in his last two films.  Simply way over towards the \\"campy\\" end of the believability scale.<br />If you find yourself on a plane with a short battery in your laptop and enjoy reading about Italy with some mild intrigue thrown in, then this is a book for you.  Otherwise, it is like the \\"Da Vinci Code\\", a decent story built around some historical conspiracy theories and unsubstantiated religious connections.  I would say that both of the books have the scholarly attributes of the National Enquirer, but this book is not written quite as well.	2004-02-15

It also provides some great insight into how to create a trusting and positive environment while teaching some positive habits.<br />My wife read this book first and I noticed an immediate change in how she reacted to our rather headstrong two-year old.  Staying calm, and giving choices like:  Do you want to have milk before you go to bed, or juice?  This instead of the battle on whether or not she was going to bed.  We find ourselves laughing at some of the absurd choices we come up with, and it's harder than it appears to consistently think this way.  What is easy to see is that it works, and works well.  Some of our biggest battles over dressing, or going to bed, or eating dinner have become much easier and the \\"uh-oh\\" said calmly has stopped some poor behavior in its tracks!<br />While we both embrace the fact that testing the limits is a natural and healthy way for young children to learn, this book gave some great insights on how to facilitate and not discourage that type of learning, and yet still teach the right behaviors.<br />I was not thrilled with the overall editing and layout of the book, as it jumped around a bit, and half-way through would say things like:  This may not work for children under three!  OK, this is information we could have used four chapters ago when the authors were making a point we were attempting to follow.  That minor complaint notwithstanding, this is an excellent book and is highly recommended for all parents with young children.	2004-02-05

Reading a Yancey book is always an enjoyable experience for me, because of the conversational tones and quiet and unassuming, yet consistently convicting, insights he reveals.  This time around my first impression was that he had missed the mark, a follow up read to finish the book months later gave me an entirely different perspective.<br />I was originally not impressed with the first several chapters, because while it was insightful as always, it was missing the emotional connection of his previous works, and I felt as though I had \\"heard this all before\\".  The premise is his delve into the dichotomy of the two worlds Christians live in:  one the physical world, a world full of desires, and fleeting and ultimately unimportant wants, and the other a spiritual world where we place our sights on things of immeasurable value from an eternal perspective.  Obviously, this is not a new topic, but he looks closely in his usual unique perspective, at the various ways the things we encounter everyday reflect this dichotomy.  While interesting, it didn't hit on any emotional cylinders for me, and so I put the book down and moved on without finishing.<br />Months later, after unpacking from a move, I found the book, and threw it my suitcase to finish on a plane.  I picked it up in Chapter 12, where he looks into the life of the famous \\"Elephant Man\\".  So powerful is the imagery and the contrast between the grotesque outward appearance and horrific treatment he endured and the rich, simple, and deeply loving personality of this man, that the message hit home.  How do we \\"see\\" that which is real, behind or between the exterior illusions?  From then on the book hit wonderful chords and sparked yet again the wonder and soul inspiring visionary impact Yancey is known for.<br />I quickly read the book again, and the pieces came together.  Like all of his work, Yancey creates emotional imagery by juxtaposing a variety of source material and overlaying it on a theme.  One powerful illustration was how he feels when returning to \\"home\\" after a trip out in the wilderness or to a foreign exotic location:  \\"The first day back, modern culture betrays itself as a self-evident lie, a grotesque parody of the day to day life I know.  The next day my reactions moderate.  A few days later I am breathing the air of lust, consumerism, selfishness and ambition, and it seems normal\\".  This is a wonderful glimpse at the way the current world obscures the spiritual.<br />Yancey delivers yet again.  Highly recommended, even if you have to start with chapter 12 as I did to get to the heart of the issue.  Keep writing Phillip, but perhaps look closer at editing, your work is too good to be discarded by too casual an entrance to such an important subject.ul illustration was how he feels when returning to \\"home\\" after a trip out in the wilderness or to a foreign exotic location:  \\"The first day back, modern culture betrays itself as a self-evident lie, a grotesque parody of the day to day life I know.

When I received a copy to read, I quickly downed it in one long day of travel, often reading while waiting in lines at airports.  The book simply grabs your attention and won't let go.  I lent it to a friend who was just as smitten.  The pacing is excellent and the suspense and action will have you quickly turning pages.<br />Our lead character is a slacker and is going nowhere fast until a \\"too good to be true offer\\" comes his way.  But there is a catch.  He quickly learns that all is not what it seems and he is not quite sure who he is working for, and where is loyalties lie.  He becomes a pawn in a game of corporate competition and has to make ethical choices that seem to grow by the minute.  The ending will surprise you.  The book is also timely considering the ethical climate of Corporate America these days and more insight than ever at some of what is going on behind the closed doors of the visible brands we know.<br />What the book does very well (I will not spoil the plot by explaining it all in detail like some reviews here have done) is get into the psychology and emotions of the lead character as one choice after another guides him down a path he is not sure he wants to be on.  This is perhaps the best aspect of the book, other than the pacing of the story.  You will come to your own conclusions at the end as to what choice you would make in that situation.<br />If you are considering buying this book, ignore the critical \\"editorial\\" reviews.  Are there some issues with the way corporate mechanics are depicted, or are there some shallow characters, and even a few plot holes?  Sure.  However, this book is a thriller you won't want to put down, and an experience you will want to enjoy again, and that is the point.  Highly recommended, and worthy of its hype.	2004-01-14

First, I want to agree with some other reviews here that the author's use of the word \\"persecution\\" to describe the current liberal attitude towards all things Christian is way too strong.  They are indeed waging war on Christianity as outlined here, and what it stands for from an ideological sense, but not yet on Christians as people. Also, it is unfortunate that some of the terminology within the book makes this a \\"political\\" debate, although it is a moral debate, and by aligning it with political parties it dilutes the reality of what this movement means.<br />The arguments and the undisputed evidence about the specific treatment of Christianity is absolutely bullet proof.  For those who may disagree or dismiss the evidence based on the source, please read a book which corroborates the information in this book, \\"The Death of Right and Wrong\\" by Tammy Bruce. Tammy, from a liberal perspective comes to the exact same conclusions, albeit less politely, that Limbaugh does in this book.  The section on the public education system is hardly a newsflash, and is a bit dry at times.  One always laughs out loud and wonders how many of these \\"educated\\" people fail to see the blatant self refuting nature of policies that demand \\"you must be tolerant\\".  These types of policies are outlined in this book in full detail.<br />It is in the second section that he makes his best points in my opinion.  For example, Annie Laurie Gaylor of Madison was part of a legal group trying to ensure that Mother Theresa was not depicted on public transportation bus passes (page 153).  Apparently, Ms. Gaylor feels that Mother Theresa, who spent her whole life giving selflessly to the poor and oppressed, is not in line with Ms. Gaylor's view of feminism and is somehow offensive.  But Ms. Gaylor, as astounding and abhorrent as her views are, is pretty typical of the liberal worldview which practices intolerance to an extreme seldom seen before.  The book has countless examples.<br />A few other gems are the actions of Miami-Dade County officials who disallowed all religious presentations on public grounds, except for all of those which are non-Christian in nature (page 160). A New Jersey public school bans \\"A Christmas Carol\\", Covington, Georgia is sued for labeling December 25th as Christmas on their calendar, and so it goes in case after case. What these situations represent is not so much \\"persecution\\" but simply illogical hypocrisy.<br />This is a good book, and one that presents evidence that is supported by those within the Liberal left itself.  I do disagree however with the author on whether this \\"persecution\\" is a bad thing.  Christianity is not the symbols used to represent it, but a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ, and that is not open to attack. He demonstrates that atheists and liberals who are intent on destroying Christianity have made a fatal flaw of logic; they are awakening a sleeping giant. See the reaction of the people from Franklinton, Louisiana, to an absurd ACLU suit in their town. (Page 178) Limbaugh demonstrates that liberals use a marketing scheme of tolerance and equality to push an intolerant and unequal agenda, and that they are continually violating the principles they supposedly stand on. In addition, the book demonstrates time and again that tactics used by liberals to silence Christianity are in serious danger of violating basic free-speech rights of US citizens. This is very disturbing.

I remember that name being superimposed at the bottom of the screen, \\"Al Franken\\", and laughing out loud.  That was some funny stuff.  Too bad he \\"peaked in the 70's\\" (to borrow a line from the late Phil Hartman).<br />So, why isn't he funny anymore?  Granted it's hard to top the, \\"yes it's me...Al Franken\\" bit, but I truly expected better.  So, he wants to write political books now.  So, he wants to take on O'Reilly, and other Right-Wing pundits.  That's cool, there sure is enough opportunity.  So why didn't he?  He spends a whole chapter telling how O'Reilly thought he won an award for a show it turns out he didn't?  WOW.  Hold the presses.  What is this, Jr. High?  I'm sure he can do better than this? His chapter on sex education was so lacking in basic common sense that I kept looking for the punch line.  Are we supposed to think abortions and teen sexually transmitted diseases are a good thing?  Is this what Liberals believe nowadays?  I find that hard to believe.  Nonetheless, when the only thing you can do is slam an idea that is sound because people fail to execute it, and then offer no suggestions of your own, you leave yourself open.  Franken does so here.<br />I think that his extended comic on \\"Supply Side Jesus\\" had some merit.  This is too bad, in that many are in fact corrupting the Faith for monetary gain.  So I will give him some credit for at least trying here.<br />Overall, I guess that if you are a liberal you will cheer this book, if for no other reason than he supports your worldview, but as an independent who doesn't agree with either Left or Right extreme offered, I just thought it was pretty ordinary and not very funny.  I miss the good ole days with the \\"yes it's me...Al Franken\\".  Can we get that back again?	2003-12-14

The basic premise of the book follows ancient Eastern war tactics dating to 500 BC.  A few of these are:  &quot;know yourself and your enemy&quot;, &quot;plan surprise&quot;, and &quot;win without fighting&quot;.  The book describes various tactics of war that will help an army be successful.<br />These tactics are then related to modern business.  What is unfortunate is that these tactics are needed at all.  Instead of cooperation, and mutual respect, business climates are often hostile and overly competitive - within the organization itself!<br />I did find a few of these very enlightening.  The section on &quot;picking your battles&quot; is always sage advice.  I often have asked myself and others whether a particular business situation is a &quot;hill we want to die on&quot;. The trick is to know the difference.  Also of interest are the discussions on &quot;taking the moral high ground&quot;.  In today's business climate, ethics are more important than ever, as there are far too many examples these days which are evidence that the unstated ethical fabric of business relationships have deteriorated.<br />What is unfortunate is that the Sun Tzu tactics are often useful.  While business relationships are often conflict filled battles, one can still hope and pursue mutual respect and cooperation.  Overall, an interesting read, and some useful strategic tactics.	2003-12-02

Does it have some character development issues, of course.  Does it stretch the plausibility of the reader when it comes to technology, you bet! Is it a blast to read?  Absolutely, no question.<br />In fact the last few chapters, with the clock winding down and the pressure on to solve a code with seconds to spare, I found myself literally skimming and turning pages as fast as I could to try and find out what happened and then going back for a more thorough read.  This is perhaps the highest praise for a tense thriller - the heart pounding, edge of your seat, emotional impact in the moment. It will make an incredible movie screen play, and would be a great thriller in the James Bond or Jack Ryan tradition.<br />Is this a literary masterpiece, and are the criticisms of other reviewers in regards the writing accurate?  Sure.  However, this misses the point.  This is just for fun, and in that regard succeeds brilliantly.  You will forget the details soon after, but enjoy the process.  If you get caught up in the details, then perhaps you are taking it too seriously.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride.  Highly recommended.	2003-11-24

A boy born to a poor single woman in rural Appalachia has the ability to heal others with a glance, and see into the hidden psyche of the people he meets.  After going to the hospital with an injury that quickly heals on its own, he simply walks down the hall and people are healed of terminal illnesses!  The story is at its best from here.<br />His mother who tires of the abuse by the boys father, moves with just her belongings in an old car and sets out across the country for California and a better life.  This part of the story was wonderful, rich and full of images and moods.  One could almost see the country unfolding along the way, as anyone who loves road trips can attest to. When a late night conspiracy based talk radio disc jockey gets a call about a boy with strange powers, a cross country search for the boy by a super rich and dying business man ensues.<br />While I loved the story, and the experience, the author really doesn't fully explore the theological implications and the ending wraps up all loose ends except for the main premise itself.  It is obvious the author is talented, and the book has wonderful moments, but a sequel would be great to further explore the life of the prodigy.	2003-11-11

This book is an excellent starter for anyone who is new to running a small company, and wants a better understanding of the legal pitfalls of employment practices and some practical advice on how to avoid them.  The book does a good job in covering most of the basics of employment law, and in addition provides some tips on performance management, terminations, and investigations that should work well in the majority of situations.<br />There are a couple of areas where the book is a little light, and therefore a business owner or leader would want more information.  The section and information on sexual harassment laws is weak, considering that the most common type of sexual harassment complaint (hostile work environment) is a broad set of very gray areas of risk determined by the employee.  Little coverage is given to the legal definitions of sexual harassment, including how an employer may be liable if they \\"should have known\\" the behavior was taking place.  Additionally more information on how to create a positive working environment, which avoids legal risks but is still a place where people want to work, would be useful.  Additionally, most business owners would like to see information on how to better connect the dots between employee behavior, legal constraints and business results.<br />I also recommend that any leader wishing to employ these tips and practical information in their workplace first read one of the many excellent books on leadership, or how to motivate employees, and how and why to treat people with dignity and respect.  The excellent and unusual leadership book, Leadership and Self Deception, is an example of a great companion for this text.  Consider this book the \\"what\\" and \\"how\\" of what to do with legal employment issues, and others to really focus on the \\"why\\".<br />Overall, this is an excellent resource; it is well written and planned with easy access to information.  The resources provided are excellent.  The authors did a commendable job and taking often complex legal information and writing it in a way non-lawyers can understand and utilize.  It is what it advertises to be, a legal guide.  I think this will make an excellent resource for small business owners, and plan to give my copy to a friend who runs a small non-profit and is always calling me for advise of this nature.ob and taking often complex legal information and writing it in a way non-lawyers can understand and utilize.

Let's start with perhaps the most debated premise of this book:  &quot;The heart is good&quot;.  The first reaction of many I know is to quickly exclaim that this is heresy.  Well, perhaps not.  Lets look at what he means when he says the &quot;heart is good&quot;.<br />First, he is referring to the &quot;redeemed heart&quot; specifically.  Using the backing of Scripture (Romans 10:9-10, Ezek 26:36, John 3:7, Gal 6:15, Luke 8:15, Luke 6:44-45, and more) he claims that our hearts are transformed through Christ.  This is an entirely Biblical concept.<br />Second, the heart is not the same as the flesh. Eldridge acknowledges that &quot;part of me doesn't want to love my neighbor..and it is that part I must crucify daily&quot; (page 130) and &quot;Yes, we still have to crucify the flesh on a daily basis&quot; (page 76), and even &quot;I take up my cross and crucify my flesh with all its pride, unbelief, and idolatry&quot; (page 224).  Obviously, Eldridge understands and acknowledges that the flesh is sinful, so what does he mean by the &quot;heart is good&quot;?  One example is found in Romans where Paul speaks to this very issue: &quot;It is no longer I myself who do it, but sin living within me..For in my inner being I delight in God's law.&quot; Romans 7:17-22. (page 76) If it is &quot;no longer I myself&quot; who sin, and my &quot;inner being&quot; delights in God's law, then what exactly is his &quot;inner being&quot;, and who is &quot;no longer I myself&quot;?  Paul speaks of his redeemed heart and the battle with the flesh.  It is critical to note this distinction.<br />The third element is that our heart reflects God's glory.  On page 75 he states that &quot;we were created to reflect God's glory, born to bear his image, and He ransomed us to reflect that glory again&quot;.  See Romans 8:30, Romans 2:29, 2 Cor 2:4-6, and the discussion in Chapter 4. Nothing in this book would indicate Eldridge is speaking of human glory, or some sort of humanistic agenda as he has been accused.  In fact in a prayer he uses (page 176) he states that &quot;I confess here and now that it is all about you God, and not about me&quot;, and &quot;I surrender every aspect of my life totally and completely to you&quot; (page 174).  He states that &quot;every morning we bring our lives fully back to Christ and under His Lordship.&quot; (page 174).<br />The fourth element of his claim that the &quot;heart is good&quot; is one we have to look at subjectively.  Eldridge is speaking of brokenness and its profound impact on our walk with God.  The examples of brokenness found in his own life and the lives of others (pages 136, 144, etc) give us some insight into the lie we come to believe: namely that even after redemption we are not capable of being transformed.  So deep is this lie that we are bad and unworthy that it keeps us from really living for God.  In fact CS Lewis acknowledged (page 212) that \\"when Jesus told us to love others as we love ourselves it would be a horrible command if the self were simply to be hated.\\"<br />This is a powerful book, though his writing style may not be for everyone.  Eldridge wants to really get close to the heart of the matter, and in doing so uses some often radical concepts as illustrations.  However, a deep read here shows a solid Biblical foundation and humility, not humanism.speaking of human glory, or some sort of humanistic agenda as he has been accused.

Ted Dekker is a talented writer, who in this case is able to take two seemingly unrelated storylines and bring them together with a thrilling and supernatural blend of suspense and action.  The writing is so compelling that it was nearly impossible to put the book down.  Put this one in the &quot;blurry eyed, so tired, can't go to sleep now, must stay up and finish&quot; category!<br />The only drawback was that the first three quarters are so good, that the ending was a bit far-fetched in comparison.  The spiritual aspects unfold with a healthy dose of skepticism and a surprise bit of &quot;divine intervention&quot;.<br />The basic plot follows two storylines, one of a brilliant, 190+ IQ level genius and scoundrel named Seth who is spending his time tormenting his professors at Berkeley and solving complex mathematical equations including one which supposedly proves the existence of God.  The other is about a princess in Saudi Arabia who flees the country to avoid an arranged marriage on which hinges a potential political coup in the Saudi government.  Now, if a writer can bring these two stories together in a plausible way that is saying something!<br />Along the way Seth picks up a remarkable ability to see the future, not just one possible future but many.  While two different factions from Saudi, and everyone from the local  police to the NSA, are in America trying to capture or kill the Princess, Seth is helping her escape.  The rest you have to experience.<br />With great writing, and spiritual and theological threads woven throughout, the result is a book that is simply a blast to read! Suspend your disbelief and enjoy. Highly recommended.	2003-10-31

I am writing this review nearly a full day after finishing it, and I still can't quite get over the way it ended.  Of course I will not clue you in on how it ends, nor should you find out.  This is one to experience for yourself.<br />The book starts with the lead character, Kevin Parsons, driving away from a day in seminary school and a discussion with his professor on human nature, sin and our ability for good an evil.  Kevin receives a call on his cell phone telling him he has three minutes to solve a riddle or his car will blow up. This starts an escalating chain of events involving the FBI, local police and Kevin trying to stop a terrorist insisting on making Kevin confess his sin to the public or people will get killed.  The problem is that Kevin has no idea what he is supposed to confess.<br />The book takes place over a period of just a few days.  The action is non-stop, and the clues don't make any sense.  Both a psychological thriller, one of the best I have read, and a look at the duality of human nature.<br />I highly recommend this book.  It has a solid message and is so well written you will be shocked at the ending.	2003-10-26
US	49850969	R2981LCJNN0X3T	0671027360	141370518	Angels & Demons	Books	4	1	5	N	N	Exciting story, edge of your seat action, flawed theology.	This book is actually the prequel to the Da Vinci Code, his recent bestseller.  The writing is wonderful, and the action comes at you in a blur. Brown is very adept at writing stories that move at an incredible pace.  This entire book takes place essentially in 24 hours.  The action is from the perspective of a Harvard symbol scholar named Robert Langdon.<br />This is a book that is hard to put down.  The hook comes in the first few pages when Robert is called in the middle of the night about a murder of a scientist at a top secret Swiss thinktank.  This places him in the middle of terrorism and a plot by a once thought extinct group called the Illuminati who are out to destroy Vatican City and the Catholic Church.<br />The action is great, reminiscent of Indiana Jones, and the plot keeps you on the edge throughout.  The only flaw is the theology used.  The way Brown weaves into the story a one-sided view of religion, Christianity in particular, mares an otherwise excellent effort.  One excellent point that was made within the story was that science cannot really answer any of the important questions about purpose and meaning.  To be fair, his not so subtle jabs at faith are mostly up front in the story and reflect the views of the lead character. That said, Brown seems to get all of his information on religion from atheists, conspiracy theorists, and pseudo-scholars. Other than the absurd and very flawed theological constructs he tries to weave into the story this is a well-written book and a blast to read.	2003-10-11

I grew up in Seattle, and having left 10 years ago and experienced life outside my hometown, I was amazed to see Moody put into print the very emotional love/hate relationship I have with the city, and the distant perspective that greed has ruined it forever. I come home often for business and to see family, and always experience the longing for home and the breathtaking natural beauty, while loathing the fact that the area has become more like your average East Coast city in terms of traffic and pace.  It seems Seattle traded its innocence in the pursuit of greed. In the last place one would want to sell-out, it has seemed to me from my viewpoint that they did in droves.  One thing about this book for the average reader, if you didn't grow up here you will probably not &quot;get it&quot;.<br />I loved the fact that for the first time I have ever seen, someone actually understands the natural lighting of the area.  The soft and luminous backlighting that displays greens so deep you swear the plants are lit from within.  The soft grayness that always made me feel safe and welcome. No wonder that my favorite days in sunny Colorado are in fact rainy ones. To an outsider, the constant winter rain is depressing, but to one who really experienced it, it simply is the weather that makes everything the city is about make sense. A world without sharp edges.<br />His depictions of the siren song of the fast paced world of Microsoft were simply scary.  It is truly frightening at the ease in which one can get caught up in the looking glass world of the lure of money, and the drug-like addiction to always being on the verge of the next best thing. Even a lifelong anti-establishment journalist like himself got caught up in it. This insider look at the underbelly and reality that is the Microsoft culture of excitement and boundless ambition is the best depiction I have seen of the psychological hold the culture has on people.  I too have spent the last 20 years with contrasting bits of envy at the lucky ones whose normal work made them millions, and appalled at the sell-your-soul tradeoff it seemed to require.  Moody sums it up well on page 250 when speaking of a friend whose relationship broke up due to the disparity of buying power after one of the two made millions and retired at 31, by saying &quot;I knew what she was feeling because I felt it myself: an unpalatable, unenduring mix of horror, envy, disgust, and prurience.&quot;<br />I loved the inside look at the Sub-pop scene, and the fast cycle of growth and decay of the &quot;Seattle grunge sound&quot; and the mainstream charade it became. It is always strange to see people you went to high school with depicted in a history of Seattle, having played a role in its cultural history.<br />Moody has done a brilliant job at depicting the change of a city and its culture.  From the WTO disaster to the mainstreaming of Seattle icons like Starbucks, he tells of innocence and purity designed and lost somewhere along the way.  As for when and how it happened, it's apparently all a part of the Seattle historical cycle. Written in a style that could only come from Seattle, he meanders slowly through memory and history, only to then quickly burst madly through recent events he experienced with an abject though distant horror, always balancing being separate from and yet a part of the change itself.  A literary masterpiece for those who &quot;get it&quot;, and likely an interesting non-fictional journey for those who don't.

I picked it up because it was supposedly a look at life in the Seattle suburb of Federal Way.  I grew up in Seattle so that grabbed my attention. What it turned out to be was a book about nothing.  Literally.  Just short snapshots of people's sad and pathetic lives, doing nothing, going nowhere, and as depressing as the long and rainy Seattle winters.  Bleak and disturbing but hard to pull away from, it's the Jerry Springer show without the set.<br />Here are the high points.  The author is a great writer, of this there is no doubt.  He truly creates vivid pictures so realistic that you will have to double-check that it is fiction.  The emotions and circumstances of the character's and their lives hit you with an impact that still lingers long after completing the book.  It is a quick read and easy to experience, so little effort is required to get the effect.<br />However, the result of this fiction is somewhat of an enigma for me.  Why?  Why write these stories?  What is the point?  Throughout the book, in between the chapters about very depressing people and lives that make you thankful they are not yours, are Bible verses.  No explanation is ever given for their purpose.  I guess this book is like a piece of artwork - much is left to the imagination of the observer.<br />I found the whole experience rather disturbing, but in a real way so I suppose that shows talent.  If this is your thing, then by all means buy it and enjoy it.  You can feel wonderfully depressed.  Otherwise, take my word for it, the author is talented, but wait to see if he writes something with more purpose than a short glimpse into the sad and pitiful lives of lost and wounded people.	2003-09-24

The key to fiction is to draw the reader into the story and the author does this masterfully. The life of the lead character undergoes such drastic and sudden change in the first few chapters that it is often painful to read. Another reviewer mentioned similarities to Grisham, and while there are some in style, unlike Grisham who weaves the reader slowly into an unfolding story, Dekker hits you in the head with it!  Just when you think you have an understanding of the life of Kent, the lead character, out of nowhere comes a dramatic and unexpected turn.  The whole book is like a roller coaster, a steady thrill punctuated by moments of sheer terror.<br />The best aspect of the book was the emotion captured in the lead character.  His reaction to being unfairly cheated out of an employment financial bonus, his outrage at the betrayal and his feelings of helplessness when it is discovered that the decision to do so goes all the way to the top of the organization, sets off a journey of revenge.  All through the story the conflicting emotion is captured powerfully.  Also excellent were the realities of how empty life really is when wealth is substituted for relationship.  The spiritual battle was always kept just out of reach and therefore never really comes together as smoothly as intended.  However, the reader never really understands the larger picture until the last chapter.<br />Overall, a very powerful depiction and fascinating story.  I doubt one could read this book without being impacted along the way.	2003-09-13

Combinations of JRR Tolkien like mythology and Steven King horror woven into a modern day tale of archeological discovery and intrigue.<br />The book starts out as a frightening thriller about a variety of interactions with unknown creatures and situations.  It all comes together when it is discovered that an entire world exists beneath the surface populated by an unknown species. Is this Hell?<br />The best aspect of the book is the vivid and remarkable creation of a world below the surface.  The depictions of new species, and discoveries are painted with such detail that the reader is taken along on the journey with the characters.  The depictions of several of the main characters are also well done.  The pace and suspense keep the reader engaged throughout, eager to see what comes next.<br />The theological issues often lack depth, but frame an interesting sub plot.  In the end, several ideas are postulated but not really closed out, leaving much to the imagination.  This is much more effective than trying to tie up all loose ends, as it depicts a more realistic mystery.<br />Overall, I would say that this is a great story but the book is not for everyone.  Fans of sci-fi, fantasy and Steven King type thrillers will not be disappointed at all, as it is extremely well written.  I agree with the other reviewers here in that this has the potential for being a great film.  An excellent addition to the fantasy genre.	2003-08-28

I picked this book up without knowing much about it, and read it on an airplane.  It would be remarkable if it was a true story, but as a fictional novel one has to wonder about the motivation.  That said, the story itself starts slowly and is perhaps overly done in regards to the sexual relationship between a young man and a much older woman.  On a couple of occasions I just about put the book down in the first third as the story was choppy and seemed to be a sensationalized fantasy of a male teen-ager, but was glad I didn't drop the story there.<br />The emotion evoked in the last several chapters is so vivid one can feel it long after the book is over.  The sense of loss, the emptiness of change and the confusion between morality and personal attachment is explored quite deeply.  I think that perhaps what makes the story compelling, and sometimes a bit frustrating, is the perspective of the main character.  We are let in as if it is being told in the first person, but either the central character is a person who has difficulty accepting and processing reality, or the audience is only let in so far.<br />In the end, this is a story about expectations, and the loss that comes with change. It is about the moments in time when reality in the present comes face to face with our memories and our held beliefs about situations and people.  The result is always bittersweet and vividly powerful.  A good read, and a moving story.	2003-07-19
US	49850969	R2OI3PWPJMBU0X	0060977337	407534724	Downsize This! Random Threats from an Unarmed American	Books	3	10	12	N	N	An often funny book with a compassionate but narrow view.	I picked up this book recently, and although the political climate is quite dated, the basic premise of his worldview comes through clearly.  The book is written is a rapid fire quick sound bite burst approach, and is therefore quite an easy read.  I found myself saying \\"yes!\\" and then quickly in the next chapter \\"no!\\" just as passionately.  Why?<br /><br />Let me give you a couple quick examples of his thinking, which are in the end quite narrow and one-sided most of the time.  He spends a better portion of the book (hence the title) bashing the Corporate America practice of sacrificing the working person on the alter of profitability.  He uses the closures of the auto makers and the devastating effects on Flint, Michigan, where many of the fine folks worked.  OK, fair enough.  I can agree with him that this practice on paper looks horrific, and no doubt often is.<br /><br />However, what he fails to present though is a big picture look at why this really happens.  For example: a car manufacturer closes a Flint Michigan plant and opens one in Mexico where labor is cheaper.  Thus thousands of Americans, hard working middle class patriots, are out of work.  The Company then declares that it's profits rise by some obscene amount and awards its leader with obscene amounts of money.  I can see his compassion for these working class people, and agree with it and admire it.  However, what is he really saying?  Does he really just ignore the fact that those same people, who are now out of work, practiced behavior as \\"consumers\\" that drove this change?  Are all Americans willing to pay higher prices for certain products just so the people who make them stay employed or make more money?  Sometimes, but the majority of consumers expect a better product for less money and thus Companies must comply or be out of business.  True, Corporate America exhibits precious little ethical responsibility for the lives of those workers whose labor put them there, and the pay differentials between the senior leaders and workers is obscene and completely despicable, but the argument truly is more complex than Mike Moore offers here.<br /><br />In light of this, it is a known (and amazing) fact that Moore himself, despite all of his propeganda does not drive American cars - the ones produced in Flint Michigan!  This kind of hypocricy is the other side of Michael Moore, and the liberal battle cry of \\"it's always someone elses fault\\".<br /><br />Another amazing dichotomy of thought is his celebration, yes really \\"celebration\\", of abortion.  Somehow Mr. Moore feels that the practice of killing ones unborn child is a cause for celebration?  How he correlates this with his compassion for the hard working people who are mistreated by some faceless entity called Corporate America is truly a mystery and never explained.<br /><br />Overall, the book is well written and quite funny.  He hits some home runs with his exposure of the unethical behavior that is Corporate America and its system of rewarding the few on the backs of the many.  But sadly, the forest view here illuminates a socialistic worldview and too little actual thinking through of issues.  Mike Moore reacts, and hits back emotionally.  Sometimes he hits the mark, sometimes he misses, and sometimes he is just totally wrong, but he certainly has a likeable style in doing so.nior leaders and workers is obscene and completely despicable, but the argument truly is more complex than Mike Moore offers here.

This book moved me. So moved in fact that I often had to simply put the book down and walk away. The facts and reality of the agenda of those in the Left elite are demonstrated so clearly that it is hard to read, and harder still to imagine just how many lives have been and are being destroyed deliberately at the hands of the &quot;malignant narcissists&quot; (her term - page 26). Again, these disturbing facts in this book do not come from a religious or conservative viewpoint, but from a self professed liberal, gay, non-religious, former President of NOW - in other words, they come from inside the Left itself!<br />The most shocking example of just how far this worldview has penetrated our society is the fact that many of these Left elite groups actually think that sexualizing your children for their own perverted benefit is a good thing! For example, GLSEN and their cartoon STD characters (page 115), or the ongoing work of the ultimate in mainstream pedophile supporters, Judith Levine, who states that &quot;Sex is not harmful to children...there are many ways even the smallest of children can partake in it&quot; (page 193). As outrageous as this sounds, it is not some fringe group of marginalized pedophiles that want this evil perpetrated to rationalize their depravity, but rather the leaders of the &quot;special interest&quot; groups on the Left, sponsored by their friends in the media. Well-documented facts throughout the book reveal this agenda clearly.<br />The book is essentially a direct assault on the &quot;Looking Glass&quot; world of moral relativism. Within this worldview, there is no right or wrong, therefore all behaviors and all results of that behavior cannot be condemned. Of course the hypocrisy of the Left condemning others is clear to everyone, and she outlines it in example after example. Whether this is glorifying cold-blooded killers, pedophiles, and rapists, or whether it is hypocritically attacking and silencing those whose views would judge the actions of convicted murderers as &quot;wrong&quot; the source is the same. The cause is the &quot;malignant narcissism&quot; of the damaged people who comprise the Left elite, in particular those who lead the various &quot;special interest&quot; groups. Unfortunately, through this agenda to destroy value and virtue, everyone is painted through the lens of the worst offender, even those within those groups who are good and decent people.<br />Tammy Bruce has yet again written a debilitating expose on the reality of what many of these Left groups are espousing. Tammy understands and demonstrates, for perhaps the first time I have seen in print by someone from the Left, that Christianity in particular is viciously attacked. What she never explains in the book is why Christianity, and not Islam or Judaism, who are equally scathing in their judgement of the moral practices of the Left, is attacked while the others are not. Truth is likely the reason. In using CS Lewis's classic &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; she discovers intellectually that the morals we hold to as people, and the values our hearts embrace, are the basic virtues of &quot;Prudence, Temperance, Justice and Fortitude&quot;. &quot;The Left has to restrict thought to destroy the concept of judgement and undermine notions of right and wrong&quot; (see full quote on page 19). Tammy describes the Left's worldview is a world of self-gratification that requires an end to personal responsibility. Values, decency, and knowing right from wrong - and having the courage to act on that knowledge - are all verboten. (See full discussion on page 25)<br />A very powerful and moving book for anyone across the political spectrum. It is a very painful reminder that much is at stake for our society and our future.

Rarely have I read a book that so thoroughly destroys a facade like this book does.  What adds to its potency is the undeniable fact that the author self professes in the beginning of the book to be a gay, liberal, pro-choice, former President of NOW.  This she claims gives her \\"insider\\" status on what she writes about. While I may disagree with some of her views, I respect and admire the honesty with which she systematically exposes the hypocritical and destructive tactics of the \\"activists\\" on the Left.  Tammy Bruce is an excellent author, and an expert on the subject.<br />The chapter describing the attacks on Dr. Laura by GLAAD are detailed and exposed for what they were, as she contends they were cowardly and shameful acts of hypocrisy. Despite her insider status, she was treated as an outcast within her own organization for even questioning such tactics. In looking at such supposedly benign issues such as hate-crimes legislation and those on the Left who support it, she demonstrates the logical absurdity of this legislation.  By simply looking at the legislation we realize that it by definition implies that blacks, Jews, and gays must be much more neurotic and weak than others because we are led to believe that crime affects them much more than it does everyone else. Do the parents of a murdered straight child grieve less that those of a gay child? Is the pain or damage any less? (See page 40 for this discussion).  She outlines the damage caused by \\"groupthink\\" and how much like cults some of these Left organizations have become.  The irony of trying to silence people who disagree with the liberal left worldview for being intolerant isn't lost on her as it is with most everyone else on the Left.<br />The disturbing trend of mind control being practiced on our college campuses these days prompts her to say that when a woman giving a speech about individual empowerment has to flee for her safety there is something twisted going on.  She also indicates in the chapter that the power the Thought Police wield at universities and schools is indeed disturbing.  However, the good thing is that at least it gives us a clear view of what exactly the Left wants.  In an environment under their ideological control, the Thought Police have free reign to silence opinions, squelch debate, and punish dissent (see page 222 for the exact quotes).<br />The exposure of minority leaders such as Jesse Jackson and others that actually deliberately attempt to perpetuate victimhood and create racial tension for their own benefit, where none actually exists, prompts her to describe them as \\"Misery Merchants\\".  In devoting a chapter to these sad phenomena she implies that what started as a struggle for equal rights and a color-blind society has turned into a major profit industry - the victim industry.  The details and evidence for this is truly disturbing in how disingenuous it all really is.<br />This is a powerful book.  The arguments are so airtight, and due to her status as an \\"insider\\" to this movement, the result is a chilling look at just how far this group will go to create a \\"Stalin-like\\" state where any viewpoints except their own are severely punished.  I experience this Thought Police approach in Corporate America and in the local media.  This book will likely stir emotions on both sides of the fence.  It states in the most compelling and undeniable way yet the dangers of the Thought Police and the agenda of the liberal left.

I recently purchased a \\"classic\\" 5 series BMW.  I love the older style of the E-12 and the E-28 models to the all-too-common look of recent 5 series, which look way too much like Toyota Camry's.  \\"Not that there is anything wrong with that\\"! (an homage to the millions of Camry owners).  So, I had great interest in this book as a recent convert to the marquee.<br />Sadly, there was no mention of my particular model, the US 1987 535is.  Despite this disappointment, the book is excellent and the photos of rare and European models not often seen here in the States are wonderful.  The text is also quite interesting as were the unexpected photos of US cars like the Camero and the Pacer, shown as examples of what was \\"also\\" being produced in those years.<br />My only complaint about the book is that it is not laid out quite right.  While loosely chronological, the book does skip around a bit, and would be improved greatly by back-to-back photos of all 5 series models to show the change and development of the series over the last 30 years.  Also rarely mentioned was the precursor to the 5 series model - the Bavaria.  Like all things BMW, the book is more expensive than it needs to be.  Nonetheless, a good book for the enthusiast.	2003-06-28

A fun book to read, and very well written.  Dan Brown keeps you in suspense for the first three-quarters of the book with fast pacing, quick editing, and an engrossing tale!  The book is truly hard to put down as the clues are revealed slowly - always just out of reach.  I resisted the temptation to read ahead often.  Sadly, I was disappointed that the ending wasn't better, but perhaps that's because the agenda of the author became increasingly clear as the book progressed.<br />At last we have a good book about the tired old premise of the Knights Templar and Mary Magdalene, and the secret society. However, just when he was really moving with the story I about fell out of my chair laughing when all of a sudden some of the truly comical books on this premise are woven into the story as if they mean something. On page 253 he mentions one book prominently: The Templar Revelation.  This is a truly hilarious book, and unlike The Da Vinci Code, it fails to actually admit it is fiction and tries to pass itself off as scholarly research and therefore fails miserably.  See my review of the book here on Amazon.com. On page 267 he weaves in another work of fiction called: The Greatest Story Ever Sold.  But again, unlike Mr. Brown, the other works are not nearly as well written, and are simply bad docu-dramas.  His not so subtle theological agenda is woven into what is otherwise a great fictional mystery.  He quotes some of the Gnostic Gospels that have been clearly depicted as frauds by most Biblical scholars of any merit.<br />Unfortunately, Mr. Brown gradually lets go of the fictional story he starts with and it seems he actually believes what he is writing.  The first clue that this is truly a work of fiction is before the prologue where he tries to make his fiction look like fact.  On the top of page 234 he gives the sad worldview of the Jesus Seminar.  Also, as mentioned, he tries to incorporate other works to make it look like his premise is founded on something more than \\"X-File\\" level conspiracy nonsense.  This is unfortunate because he is obviously a talented writer, and has written the best book on the subject yet - a mystery, a fictional tale, and a fun conspiracy story.<br />A fun book to read - so four stars!

The story flows smoothly and, while often a bit cliche, keeps you interested throughout.<br />The other reviewers here didn't mention the best aspect of the book in my opinion.  There is a story within the story about an arrogant playboy who is paralyzed and maimed in the plane crash and has to come to terms with his character as his looks and career are derailed.  He finds out much to his dismay that he really doesn't have any depth, having relied on his looks and focused on his Porsche, his pursuit of women, and his material possessions.  This was truly a thought provoking treatment and was the highlight of the book.<br />As a mystery, it doesn't really work because you as the reader know who's who by halfway through the book. I also found the love story to be a bit contrived.  There is a fair amount of suspense and the characters are pretty well developed, except for the villain, who is simply a one-dimensional character whose behaviors are never really explored beyond anger and resentment.  This is too bad because there could have been some real development here, considering the rest of the characters have to undergo some brokeness to change.<br />Despite some flaws, I gave the book 4 stars because it is a fun book to read, and the values are sound.  The insight into how fast life can change is also excellent.	2003-06-11

Wayne Alderson, in his book &quot;Stronger than Steel&quot; talked about his role in the amazing turn around in the early 70's of Pittron Steel Company, and highlighted the risks he took to put people first in the heat of an &quot;unwinnable&quot; battle with the union.  In this book, \\"Theory R Management\\", he takes the principles learned in that turn around and develops them further.<br />&quot;Theory R&quot; management says:  &quot;People come before economic and organizational concerns.  They are the most important asset and the most important product of any organization&quot;.  In the first chapter titled &quot;Taking a risk to find a better way&quot; he states that the &quot;key is building relationships&quot;.  With confrontation, everybody loses.  This simple fact outlines the necessity of this book.  As a Human Resources Director, I see firsthand how a failure to put people before processes can undermine a business's success.  Far too often, a manager relies on confrontation instead of seeking a win/win when dealing with labor relations and employee discipline.  The long-term cost is a lack of trust, not only with the one employee but others as well.  This book addresses some rock solid principles to ensure both valuing the person and holding them accountable for business results are met together.<br />In the section titled &quot;Treating other's with respect&quot; Wayne outlines some principles behind &quot;Theory R&quot;: Respect an employees needs.  Respect an employee's desires.  Respect an employee's potential.  Respect an employee's family.  These first three are pretty common in most business manuals, but &quot;Respect an employee's family&quot;?  The theory is that if we respect an employee's family with time and appreciation, a cyclic effect begins.  Family members place a greater value on the workplace and the working parent or spouse.  Employees feel more pride in their work and more appreciation at home.  (Page 100).<br />The principles here in this book are at times self-evident, at times truly revolutionary for Corporations and at times perhaps too simplistic.  What is clearly evident though is how they resonate with people who hear them.  Wayne is on to something here, and the risk is well worth the reward.  This book should be required reading for anyone in business, especially those whose employees are supported by labor unions.e.  Employees feel more pride in their work and more appreciation at home.

This book attacks the concept of political correctness and the hypocritical quicksand of \\"moral relativism\\" by weaving a tale of suspense and intrigue into the everyday life of a liberal newspaper reporter.  The book hooks you from the beginning, with a story about three friends on a typical Sunday afternoon watching football, and tossing a coin to see who will drive to get the pizza at halftime.  The coin lands, and stays, on its side! All three pile into the car together and after picking up the pizza and heading back, there is a terrible accident and the story picks up with one of the three, the reporter, awaking in the hospital. Thus begins a journey during which his popular beliefs about life, meaning and morality are challenged in a very personal way.  Instead of spoiling the story, I will leave it up to the reader to explore.<br />The message of the book can be best described by the following passage regarding morality (page 419).  \\"Maybe the greatest danger isn't when the rules get broken, maybe it's when the rules get changed.  Once they're changed you can follow the new rules and think you are doing the right thing, while all the time your new truth is just the old lies.  You can tell yourself it's OK because the standards have changed, but if the standards mean anything at all they don't change.  I want to follow the truth no matter where it leads me.  The Truth will set you free.\\"<br />Overall, this is a well-written story, and provides enough twists and turns to keep the reader interested.  Often however, the author seems to try and take on too many issues at once.  The depictions of the social agenda's of various special interest groups and how they drove the slant of news stories was frighteningly accurate, considering the book was written in 1994 well before the documented events of liberal bias on behalf of Networks and print media had been exposed in the last few years by numerous sources.  The author points out in the notes at the end of the book that \\"This is a work of fiction.  While it contains many factual details which are the product of careful research, it intermingles these events with fictitious settings and persons\\".<br />A good story, with a well-needed message.that \\"This is a work of fiction.

To take on this topic in the manner he does is courageous to be sure, as the idea of criticizing \\"democracy\\" is not one with much support.<br />Despite the fact that book is researched well, and his ideas are outlined clearly, it is apparent that there is a certain bias inherent in his worldview. For example, he states that \\"democracy is not inherently good\\". What does he mean by this? He seems to be trying to start with a premise, and then support it through his conclusions. However, the premise is weak. I do agree that a \\"democracy\\" in and of itself does not mean that the result of that \\"democracy\\" will be inherently good. Democracy is not a result, but rather a process. A process that can result in positive or negative consequences depending upon how it is used, and by whom participates. Another reviewer here nailed it when he said that a democracy needs \\"good people\\" to function properly. This is truly the heart of the matter, and is usually so obvious as to be \\"self evident\\". However, Zakaria misses this point entirely.<br />Another weak point being made is that \\"in numerous new democratic processes, the elections serve not as a guarantee of liberty, but a legitimization of tyranny\\". I believe he is at best over simplifying and at worst completely wrong. In the first sense, an election which \\"legitimizes tyranny\\" is in effect a self-refuting concept. Either the elections are not truly a democratic process at all by not allowing for free and open decision making by the people (thus the tyranny), or the result of the election is the chosen path by the people. In one case, democracy exists in name only and simply does not really exist at all, and in the other case it has worked as it should. Since democracy is a process by which people determine the outcome, the blame for a negative result of the true use of a democratic process lies with the morality of the people participating, not the process itself. In the examples he uses throughout the book, he seems to miss this point.<br />He also argues that \\"liberty depends less on the will of the majority than it does on the institutional safeguards for the rights of minorities.\\" This is a common tactic, but one that isn't the neutral worldview he would have you believe it is. It implies that the \\"minority\\" in opinion \\"should\\" be treated with the same level of weight as the majority. Why? He seems unaware that this view is in itself a philosophical worldview that has no foundation. Falling into the illogical spiral that is moral relativism, he equates \\"minority\\" opinion as being more valid than majority opinion, to the point of saying the failure to safeguard the minority opinion threatens liberty. Strong words indeed, but what does he truly mean by them? Are all minority opinions valid inherently simply because they are in the minority? One hopes not. In this country there are many minority opinions, such as neo-nazi's, and other racist hategroups. Is he implying that because these views are not popular, and not held to the same standard as the majority view of freedom for all that liberty is threatened?<br />I will agree with him on one thing, democracy in and of itself is not inherently good. Without a moral compass to guide, and standards of morality on which to base judgements of good vs. evil, a democracy can a failure. The majority can be tragically wrong, as he points out as one example of democracy gone badly: 1930's Germany. He is right in implying that the majority view is not always good, but what he in the end fails to do is to provide any solution. One could walk away from his work thinking that there is some formula of the right mix of democracy and dictatorship that will result in a moral and \\"good\\" society. Sadly though, democracy is but a process, and with any process, the true determination of whether it is good or bad is the hearts of the people participating. In the end, his views are not new; they are scattered throughout the New Testament of the Bible, where the ultimate consideration for governing and decision making is a reliance on the \\"law written on our hearts\\". All other processes, including his idea of liberalizing international politics, will only be as successful as those who participate.

US	49850969	R25UEA86AG29XL	0743406125	302105199	Year Zero	Books	3	11	16	N	N	A surreal, violent, and engaging thriller going nowhere	I was lent this book to read by a friend, and once I started reading became quickly hooked.  The basic premise is compelling enough, and contains some Christian overtones and intrigue.  The back cover for example states that a clone from the \\"Year Zero\\" has been created who thinks he is Jesus Christ.  This depiction, along with the first few dozen pages of an archeological expedition to uncover relics and bones from beneath the hill where Christ was crucified captured me into the story.<br />However, the book quickly veers into a worldwide plague, which kills all in its path.  The central character is falsely imprisoned in Tibet, and when he finally escapes, he has a journey around the globe in a world with few survivors and little civilization left.  Driven by a desire to find his daughter, and the man who left him for dead in the mountains and falsely accused him, he makes his way back to the US.  This is the most intriguing part of the story in my opinion.  As the story unfolds the book switches back and forth, with sometimes choppy and confusing editing, between a lab compound in Las Alamos New Mexico filled with scientists trying to find a cure for the plague, and the journey, while the rest of the world dies off.<br />The story of the lead character, desperate and driven through incredible odds and danger with the hope of finding his daughter, is what moves the story and emotion.  Sadly though, the author seems to have a naturalistic worldview, and therefore once he opens the Pandoras box of cloning, worldwide plagues, and the Christian faith, he has nowhere to go with it.  The result is that the story ends with a pathetic whimper, not with the hope of life.  His views of the bleakness and hopelessness of a world without meaning, is what leads to a profound letdown in the story.<br />In the end, it felt like a distant nightmare.  Where ones feels jarred and moved by the violence and death, by the search for reunited families and hope, and yet so meaningless in the end that it is quickly discarded.  If you like being swept into a story then the book does that well enough to keep you hooked.  However, the author is so sadly lacking in any spiritual hope that the net result is disappointment and a tragic ending without meaning.ss in the end that it is quickly discarded.

This book describes a rarity in the modern Western corporate arena; a company that operates in the marketplace of publicly held companies led by a set of core values aligned to putting people before profits.  The values espoused by the ServiceMaster Company include; &quot;To Honor God In All We Do, To Help People Develop, To Pursue Excellence, and To Grow Profitably.\\"<br />As stated by the CEO, C. William Pollard, &quot;the first two are 'ends', the second two are 'means'. Few find fault with our commitment to a set of principles, it is the God language that raises some eyebrows.&quot; That is not the only thing this Company has done to raise eyebrows, meeting the numbers, delivering consistent world-class service, and delivering profits to shareholders also gets attention.<br />This book is a great look into a Company with values all organizations could benefit from. Among them is the concept that &quot;employees want to work for a cause, not just a living&quot;. When you think about what ServiceMaster actually does (not the most glamorous or well-paid work) we can understand how difficult this would be to execute.<br />The book itself is a quick read, and full of some good insight. It is not as in depth as I would have liked, but overall provides some outstanding ideas on how to prioritize values, and remain true to one's principles. The example set by the Company and the CEO demonstrates that not all of Corporate America places greed as their highest priority.	2003-04-28

It is hard to find the words with which to accurately describe this unique novel.  I was at times charmed by the beautiful way in which the lead character comes to life.  That said I was disturbed from the outset at the strange and tragic turn of events.  Rarely does a novel set you up so well with the first few pages.<br />I would love to describe the story, and will attempt to, although this book may just be one which has to be experienced to be believed.  It is somewhat a tale of a man caught in a battle of ancient gods from mythology like Odin, and includes bar brawls with leprechauns and such.  The lead character is hired to be an \\"errand man\\" for a forgotten \\"god\\" trying to battle American society's new \\"gods\\" of television, technology, and the Internet, which are brought to life as actual beings.  The author does such a tremendous job of weaving the story from the viewpoint of a man so deeply haunted by a recent loss and betrayal that what he experiences in the supernatural is almost taken with a calm disinterest.  The story weaves back and forth with lightning speed between dream, reality and the supernatural, leaving a dreamy feeling while reading.<br />Also dispersed throughout the book are, out of nowhere, brief description of other &quot;gods&quot; and events, which read like a rich tapestry of history to a degree where I was looking for footnotes.  I will say this; Mr. Gaiman has an incredible imagination!<br />This is a rather strange book, it is at times a page-turning, stay up all night to finish novel, and at other times goes a bit too far into the horror and graphic depictions of a Stephen King. Some of the more graphic depictions seemed to be unnecessary to the storyline. This should serve as a warning for those who cringe easily.  Despite these drawbacks, I was hooked into the story from the start, and wanted to finish it as fast as I could.  That is itself high praise for a novel.  Well done, strange and overly graphic, but a well written and compelling story.mpelling story.	2003-03-30

Well, the book was excellent, well written and fascinating, which is remarkable for the subject matter.  However, fast food itself is changing and often is not the processed nightmare of the past, and even after reading the book I will still partake in an occasional McDonalds hamburger and fries.<br />The book itself is simply outstanding.  The depictions of the slaughterhouses are enough to make one a vegetarian immediately.  The details into the background of the various industries that supply fast food restaurants were remarkably well researched and written in a very readable fashion.  I especially enjoyed the roots of the fast food business - California of course -and how this &quot;American&quot; industry came into being so quickly.  The sections on potatoes were also gripping and, perhaps not what the author intended, made me quite hungry for a big plate of fires while reading.<br />The one complaint I had about the book were the sections on the employee standards and union avoidance tactics of the industry.  I feel the author had a liberal agenda that missed a critical element of how our economy works.  The days of labor unions protecting jobs or improving working conditions are nearly completely over, and in reality were never as effective as they were portrayed to be.  Rather, it is the free market economy and the supply/demand curve of available workers that drives working conditions and pay.  When fast food restaurants have to compete with other industries for talent, the wages are driven up far faster than the added cost of unions ever could.<br />Other than this section and agenda, the descriptions of personal glimpses into this razor thin margin business were great.  I did admit feeling for the &quot;little guy&quot;, the franchise owners, as opposed to the corporations that run them.  One almost can correlate the tactics of some of these corporations as being like a &quot;family&quot;.<br />Overall, a great book and a very enjoyable and interesting read.

As a fan of Chris Farley's work on SNL and in movies, I was looking forward to some insight into this troubled man's life.  Sadly, this book contains precious little insight into Chris and his sad demise.<br />If you too have laughed out loud at the antics and performances made famous by Chris, and were saddened by his early passing, then you may find this book an interesting, albeit very brief, look at his career and life.

If you have heard the saying \\"there is nothing new under the sun\\", then it must apply to the principles of the Book of Proverbs and how they apply to business thousands of years after they were written.  This is an excellent book, and a timeless look at how basic principles guiding human behavior apply in the workplace.<br />Often in western business there is an attempt to assume that \\"business\\" and \\"religion\\" don't mix and that somehow the Judeo-Christian value system outlined in the Bible is better left at the door when coming to work.  However, nothing could be further from the truth.  As outlined in this book, Proverbs gave us all sound advise that for thousands of years has helped people be successful in their work and business interactions.<br />The recent headlines of 2002 and 2003 about the lack of workplace ethics, costly corporate scandals and allegations of management fraud that dominate the business section and wiped out the retirement accounts and employment of countless employees, demonstrate that these principles are needed now more than ever.  One look at the chapter/principle headings and one might assume these principles are right out of a Covey or Drucker book.  This book gives some insight into the possible origins of many of the popular business and management philosophies.<br />Some of the principles discussed include \\"Value employee input\\", \\"Invest in Employee training\\", \\"Regard profit as a means not an end\\", \\"Measure performance validly\\", \\"Measure twice, hire once\\", and many more principles which when applied effectively will increase the success of any business venture.  Each chapter examines the passages in Proverbs, provides examples of real-life business stories demonstrating them in action, and discusses the manner in which they may be applied.<br />Overall, this book is a must for anyone who manages people, or engages in running a business.  The focus on the right priorities, and the right methods to achieve results is sound and relevant in today's business climate, as it has been for thousands of years.

This review is for all three books of the series.  If you are going to read this first book, be prepared to simply read all three in succession because the pace and suspense dictate it.<br />The basic premise and storyline of the book series centers on the depictions of the end times prophesied in the Book of Revelation found in the Bible.  Unlike other works on the subject, like the popular &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, this story focuses on the events from the perspective of someone who is unaware and even hostile towards the idea that the events unfolding are part of the Biblical story.<br />The story begins with a surprising twist: dermal skin cells are found at the heel of the Shroud of Turin, and subsequently used to clone the person whom the shroud originally covered.  This sets off a chain of events that come at you at a dizzying pace.  Unlike the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books, the depictions are graphic and disturbing, and the vast destruction caused by asteroids hitting the earth, and various plagues are depicted with a stark horror.  The \\"new age\\" references are woven into the story in a way that seems quite similar to how that movement is already forming.  It is difficult to tell throughout the story, across all three books, what the philosophical and theological views of the author are, so well written is the perspective of the main character.  We are taken along on the journey with him, with little insight into the eventual conclusions.  Also excellent are the political workings behind the world government run by the U.N.  The rise to power of the political structure is seemless and realistic.<br />The writing is fine, and the story and characters are explored with enough depth to resonate.  Essentially this book is about the story of one person who is thrust into the center of the events simply by being &quot;in the right place at the right time&quot;.  I recommend the book series for a very different perspective of a familiar story.	2003-02-28

This switch from this one Senator shifted the balance of power away from the Republican Party until the elections in 2002.  At the time I thought it was a very selfish act on the part of Jeffries, and should have been against regulations to switch from the party you were voted in on.  I picked up this book to see if my conclusions were wrong.<br />The book is well written in first person, and the events unfold at a dizzying pace.  If you ever really wanted to know what happens in the governments leadership of our country, this book provides some insights.  As much as I have a distaste for &quot;office politics&quot;, I now know a life of public service as a Senator is out of the question.  Jeffries seems to spend all his time walking from office to office, from meeting to meeting, trying to cut deals and get agreements on a tax allocation.  Other than the occasional dinner and trip, this is all that he seems to do.  It is a good look at how our political body operates.  He details the slow and inevitable conclusion he comes to when he cannot convince his fellow Republicans to fund education.<br />The slow and gradual widening of the ideological gap between Jeffries and his Party seems to be led by no less than a desire to stand up for his beliefs.  This is certainly an honorable stance, and I found myself agreeing with his conclusions.  To be blunt, if I consider the position he was trying to fight for, I would have to agree with him!  In this regard I found the book to be most enlightening.<br />However, when reading through his thought process I came to the following conclusion:  the shift was about Jeffries, not about the issue of education.  He admits that the education spending he was trying to push through wasn't going to get through anyway.  So does he work inside his party to help bridge the gap between the two political parties struggling to find common ground?  No, he simply does what he wants to do personally by becoming an independent, in the process in fact widening the very gap he was trying to close.<br />This is a very good book, and a quick and interesting read.  At first glance his position is honorable, and his ideas are sound.  In the end though, despite the initial pain of his choice, he took the easier way out.  I would have had more respect for an approach to hang in there and try and to change and influence his party, considering he was only there in the first place because the voters of Vermont allowed him in as a Republican.  That fact alone makes his decision a decision of self and not for the people.  The book is a great read though, and a good look behind the scenes at the politics of government.n the two political parties struggling to find common ground?

The premise here is not about leadership approaches, methodologies for managing employees in the workplace, or other business strategy, but is instead a close and powerful look at how we view others and how that view impacts our ability to lead them.<br />The first unusual aspect of this book is the manner in which it is written.  It is basically a novel.  It starts with contextual story written in first person, of a man who has recently joined a successful company as an executive and is called in to meet personally with the Company senior leader.  From the first few pages I was anticipating and wanting to know what would happen next.  It is within this method that the leadership principles are revealed.  This is an extremely important way to deliver a message.  I know a few people who do not read novels, but stick to non-fiction types of books.  This is a tremendous loss, as truth is most eloquently and powerfully conveyed within the context of a story.  In the New Testament for example, Jesus taught most powerfully in parables, weaving truth into a common story people could relate to.  In that manner this book weaves some powerful messages about leadership into a modern day parable of a business executive.<br />The concept presented in this book of what leadership is, is also a more unusual one in that the focus is not on &quot;what&quot; we do behaviorally to others, our outward leadership style, as most leadership books focus on, but rather our inward view of these individuals as people.  The foundational question is whether we are &quot;in the box&quot; or not.  &quot;In the box&quot; refers generally to viewing others as objects through our own biased lens, which often without our knowledge inflates our self-importance while diminishing theirs.  When reading this story I couldn't help but draw parallels to companies I have worked for, like GE, where the culture of leadership was in place, but despite all the tools most managers were not effective delivering them.  This book will give one explanation on why.<br />This book is personally challenging, in that the focus is not on how we act in that compartment of our lives called work, but rather who we are in relation to others in our family, our workplace, and strangers in our society.  I think that the message here should be experienced, so I will not lay out all the components of the book, but rather encourage you to read to be likewise challenged about your own leadership and approach to others.<br />One other review here I noticed was titled &quot;could be life changing&quot;.  I agree.  While the basic concept is not new, the packaging of this idea is so eloquently and powerfully done, that I would guess you may also experience some awareness bursts as I did while reading it. I found myself re-examining many aspects of how I lead my team at work, how I interact with peers and co-workers, and how I related to my wife. Simply put, a great book on leadership that would benefit anyone who reads it.  Well done.st managers were not effective delivering them.

I always enjoy Max Lucado's literary style and approach.  His writing reads like a friendly conversation and while the material is often presented as an admonishment, because of the tone one is never left feeling judged but rather encouraged.<br />The best sections were those on selfishness and our inability to get out of our self to truly love others.  I enjoyed the way he weaves in personal examples of his own struggles, those daily little things that set us off on ego-centric benders, with instructions of God's example of what true love for others looks like.<br />Like all his work, the only complaint is that the book is too short.  The topics are weighty and deserve more devoted analysis.  He seems to be unsure of whether he is writing a quick and simple devotional or an in depth study.  However, it is a quick and enjoyable read.<br />A final thought on the content.  If you have struggled with selfishness or any of the other human traits which keep us focused on self, not on God and others, you may be shocked to see how clearly your own behaviors are called out.  All of us are far more transparent that we would like to think, and this book showed me just how I fall short, and challenged me to strive for something more.	2002-12-27

Despite a solid history and a non-violent compassionate theology, Christianity is often viewed these days by our liberal media as a flawed, fringe belief system.  The shift has been so dramatic of late that common knowledge has been supplanted by slanted and biased viewpoints about historical fact that often paint religion as the &quot;problem&quot;.  This book looks at multiple ways in which religion has been unfairly depicted.<br />The research and points are made compellingly, and are presented with clear point/counterpoint that is hard to dispute.  One complaint I do have is that the research is presented well and yet there are too few footnotes and reference materials contained in the chapters.  I would have liked to look into some of the research further.<br />There are many of these topical areas which deserve entire books on their own. However, a couple were of particular interest to me.  The presentation of &quot;Christianity and Science&quot; is one.  The common viewpoints I come across these days from many that consider themselves &quot;scientists&quot; is that the two disciplines are mutually exclusive.  The book does an excellent job in showing the vast scientific progress made by the Church, and balances the viewpoints of the &quot;dark ages&quot; to show how Christians, specifically monks and orders, made great discoveries in agriculture, machinery, and so on.  True science is the search for truth, and that search is in no way incompatible with a Christian belief, it is only through the biased worldview of liberal scientists that these two areas of belief have become opposed.<br />Also, of note is the section on \\"Christianity and Charity\\".  While many eastern philosophies also promote care for the poor, Christianity is unique in how the poor are in fact honored.  The book highlights the significant cultural shift Christianity enabled and instilled.  The vast majority of hospitals, orphanages, and other means to care for the sick and poor were started because of Christian beliefs.  In this area Christianity truly showed the world a set of values which had been until that point unheard of.<br />Overall, a great book and an interesting read.  If you are a skeptic of Christianity this book will help you shed some of the erroneous and biased revisionist history being passed for fact these days by liberal scholars.  That most of the criticism aimed at Christianity is simply untrue is apparent with even a casual read.The vast majority of hospitals, orphanages, and other means to care for the sick and poor were started because of Christian beliefs.

From weight loss, to career changes, to attitudes, every aspect of our life can be a place we experience a \\"flashpoint\\" of awareness for a need to change. How often we sweep these under the rug, or rationalize them away, but we don't have to. The book is very grounded in Biblical principles, although the author uses examples of how many non-Christian people have taken advantage of life's \\"flashpoints\\" in a very secular fashion.<br />The book starts slowly and I felt the first few chapters tended to meander a lot.  Once the book gets into some specifics on how to identify when you might be ready for embracing one of these life changing moments, and specifically how to take advantage of the opportunities and what to expect, it is captivating and helpful.<br />I especially like the way the book cautions about the trails and challenges of embracing these &quot;flashpoints&quot;.  As is clear in the Biblical passages included in the book, we may well be called to make changes and have opportunities to make a difference in ways we haven't yet dreamed of, but these changes will not be pain-free nor without their share of consequences.  This is an excellent point, and is what separates this book from so many other &quot;seize the day&quot; type of proclamations.  Our focus truly should be on not &quot;what's in it for me&quot;, but rather &quot;what's in me for it&quot;! The trials and challenges strengthen us for a higher purpose and often without these we would be unable to succeed.<br />The last half of the book is outstanding and well worth the read. My only complaint was that the editing of the presentation was not as impactful as the message, but overall this is a great book and a good wake up call to take advantage of the &quot;flashpoints&quot; we are given and to have the courage to risk enough to change ourselves and be a change in our world.nge in our world.	2002-09-20

I picked up this book recently and once I started it I couldn't put it down. This book is written exceptionally well, and the characters and story flow smoothly and realistically. I was stunned when I realized it was not an autobiography, and was written by a man! The first person voice of a female is quite convincing. I was more than impressed with the writing and the story. Any book that can evoke emotions like this does, is worth looking into.<br />That said, should you read this book? It depends. All of the highlights above are true, but, sadly the overall effect is depressing. I kept waiting for the situation to improve, for the story to pick up, for the victim mentality to end.

I liken the experience to waking up from a bad dream, and feeling the lingering effects into the day. Your call as to whether you wish to jump on board and go along for the ride.	2002-09-03

This book crackles and pops with hard hitting and logical analysis of just how biased and pervasive the liberal spin in the media has become. The book is not written as a textbook, so in that respect it may come across as a rather venomous novel than objective research to some readers. This book is not truly objective, although it contains much objective data and detail. It doesn't need to be as the evidence is quite clearly supportive of her views, but those criticisms are valid.<br />Here are the high points in my view:<br />The subject matter is investigated thoroughly and the blistering attacks on the so called &quot;untouchables&quot; and media darlings, are exposed and detailed in such a way as to remove all doubt of the claims being made.<br />The book reads like an editorial column in places, and is actually quite funny. I laughed out loud, (usually at the expense of one of the liberal elite like Katie Couric) and chuckled at the prose.<br />The book is accurate. Not in an FBI kind of way, but rather like the small child who says the &quot;emperor isn't wearing any clothes&quot;. This is fitting because the subject matter is so obvious to anyone not blindly following our liberal media darlings that it hardly needs any deep investigation to uncover.<br />The section on book publishing, internet usage and radio ratings are worth the book price alone. Here, in the last vestiges of free choice and provable and measurable American public opinion, the real feelings of our country are apparent. Conservative books, internet boards, and radio shows so vastly outperform their liberal counterparts that the choice of &quot;the people&quot; is obvious. This choice contrasts sharply with what the television networks, and New York Times and other NY/LA elite try and tell us about what we as the American public think.<br />My complaints of the book are as follows:<br />At times the attacks are a bit too emotional. The factual evidence is so obvious and so completely proves her points that some of the more critical attacks in the book serve only as amusing anecdotes, and do not add to her case and may alienate those on the fence.<br />The title is misleading. The book is not really centrally about the &quot;Liberal lies about the America right&quot; as much as it is about the &quot;liberal lies about everything&quot;. As is presented here, there doesn't seem to be any truth in any of what the liberal spin machine presents, on really any subject matter.<br />Overall, I enjoyed the prose, and agree with the glaringly obvious conclusions presented here. It should be noted however, that the obviously hypocritical viewpoints of the liberal elite in this country do far more damage than help some of the excellent and needed liberal causes. I know many liberals who are outstanding, caring and concerned citizens, and who are also offended by the pathetic offerings of the liberal media. So in its zeal to expose the American people to the nonsense that is being spun to them, I wonder if she has gone too far in polarizing the issue? Read the book, compare it to your experience, and decide for yourself.proves her points that some of the more critical attacks in the book serve only as amusing anecdotes, and do not add to her case and may alienate those on the fence. <br />The title is misleading.

I enjoyed both the style of the writing - which uses a conversational tone with a scholarly slant - and the topic itself. One of the most appealing features of the writing itself is the way the book is laid out with footnotes included on each page. This is an informative and helpful way to present information.<br />The topic itself is one that has much relevance today. I think that Dr. Gill attempted to take a somewhat objective approach by spelling out theories and data, and while presenting an opinion, was not &quot;preachy&quot; in doing so. I also know David personally, and can attest that the themes presented here are genuine and reflect his character.<br />One highlight in particular was the first couple chapters and the interesting way to look at Christian approaches to the &quot;world&quot;. This is must reading for any Christian, regardless of denomination or background.<br />I recommend this book highly to anyone who has an interest in \\"becoming good\\".	2002-08-20

I have the privilege of being a husband to her daughter, and the father to her granddaughter. I am glad she did, as this is an excellent book about the challenges and joys of raising a daughter.<br />Dr. Leman writes this book in a conversational style, and he gives firm council without sounding preachy. He lays out real anecdotes, and recounts the ups and downs, highs and lows, of raising his daughters. Throughout the book is one common theme - be involved! He warns of the consequences that will likely result from a lack of involvement. If I thought that the challenges of being a parent were scary, the consequences of not being an actively involved one are even more so. He gives the analogy of &quot;wet cement&quot; to depict that we have but a brief time to help mold their lives, and then it is too late. There are a great many substitutes for what we are intended to provide, with most of them carrying a huge cost.<br />I enjoyed the disbursement of information he shares about various wins and mistakes he himself made with his daughters, and wish to thank his whole family for their willingness to have their personal lives shared to benefit others. When he got to the last chapter on his first experience with marrying off a daughter, I had tears in my eyes and a knot in my stomach, and my daughter is only 1!<br />Also of great importance is the fact the he stresses the value of having an openly affectionate and positive relationship with our wives as being equally important in raising daughters. Our children will model what we do, not what we say, and depicting a healthy relationship with my wife, showing various ways of handling conflicts, treating her with kindness and respect, and being openly affectionate will model for my daughter the kind of man we want her to marry.<br />Overall, an excellent book for all parents of daughters, with advice and council that is critical for parents who wish to raise their daughters to be emotionally healthy and to make good choices about their lives and relationships. The book is challenging and firm where it should be. As a father, I found several quotes and tips illuminating enough to be stored away to be used when needed. I recommend this book highly. It is not a textbook style &quot;self-help&quot; manual, but rather reads like a story. All fathers, or potential fathers, should read this book and realize what a tremendous responsibility we have for these little lives, and just how much we are needed to help mold them in a positive way.be emotionally healthy and to make good choices about their lives and relationships.

I first used this book when I was teaching \\"Introduction to Psychology\\" to college freshman at a University in Virginia in the mid-90's. I used this as an example of how statistics can be used to lead whatever agenda the user wishes, and how to think critically about what is being presented. The use of this book caused some controversy due to the racial overtones that the statistics led the authors to comment on, and it was a fun and challenging opportunity to show that the group norming data used here is on its face meaningless to individual people.<br />One of the basic premises of the book is that race is a determining factor in the scores on various intelligence tests. One of the many flaws of this statistical hypothesis is actually quite easy to demonstrate. Draw three bell curves that overlap on a chalkboard. Label the curve at the farthest right \\"Asian\\", the middle curve \\"white\\", and the farthest left curve \\"black\\". Now place three random points on the board at various places within the curves. Ask the class to state the race of the person represented by any of the scores. Obviously, you can't.<br />I recommend this book for the sole reason that it illuminates much of what is wrong about the use of statistical studies of people, and how they rarely reflect life. I also think the authors do a credible job of presenting information on valid statistical models.  However, the challenge with statistical studies is in the value and validity of the conclusions postulated as a result of the data.  In this area the authors fall a bit short in my opinion.	2002-07-28

Books	4	74	113	N	N	"Whoops - our mistake", say the naturalists	This is a very interesting book, and one that again illuminates the cultural and political virus that has undermined \\"science\\" and turned it from an objective search for truth into a close-minded and narrow religion.<br />Let's look no further than the first few chapters.  It seems that in the late 1800's a man named Haeckel falsified some drawings to try and make it look like there is little difference between the embryo's of different species, trying to support a theory still held by some naturalists, that all species arrived through some natural evolutionary process which is played out through the life cycle of the members today.  OK, so that's not surprising, a lot has happened since then right?  Apparently not.  The falsified drawings appear in Biology textbooks in the year 2000!  When confronted with publishing a fraudulent depiction to support one of the cornerstone evolutionary theories, textbook writer Douglas Futuyma stated he \\"had been unaware of the discrepancies\\". (P. 107) That they have been deemed frauds for about a 100 years has somehow been missed?  Even evolutionist and atheist Stephen Gould states in the March 2000 version of Natural History that Haeckel's drawing are characterized by \\"inaccuracies and downright falsification\\".<br />British embryologist Michael Richardson put it bluntly: \\"It looks like it's turning out to be one of the most famous fakes in biology\\". (P. 92) Not the only one obviously, and apparently not famous enough to dissuade textbook writers today from including them as \\"evidence\\" for their pet theories.<br />It gets better.  Many Naturalistic believers have stated the existence of \\"gill slits\\" in human embryos point to amphibian ancestry.  This would be interesting news if in fact these \\"gill slits\\" ever existed.  Swiss embryologist Gunter Radner explains: \\"The concept 'pharyngeal arches' is purely descriptive and ideologically neutral.  It describes folds that appear in the neck region, in man however, gills do never exists.\\"  Lewis Wolpert goes further in saying that\\"  \\"this resemblance is illusory and the structures in mammalian embryos only resemble the structures in the embryonic fish that will give rise to gills\\". (P. 106).  Let's not let the facts of science sway us from our stated belief in naturalism?<br />When speaking on the deliberate falsification and exaggerations of the beak changes in \\"Darwin's Finches\\", and of the \\"peppered moths\\" examples as some sort of evidence for macro-evolution, one textbook author who deliberately included staged pictures in his biology textbook stated:  \\"How convoluted do you want to make it for the first time learner?\\"  (P. 232) So, apparently deliberate falsification and lies presented to first time learners as truth are ethically acceptable within today's scientific community?<br />The book presents in chapter 12 an interesting comparison of the ethical standards used by naturalists to the standards employed by Securities personnel, on how to determine what is fraudulent.  (Comparisons even more relevant today with Enron, Worldcom and others demonstrating that fraudulent claim have serious consequences).  Yet why aren't these supposed objective scientists speaking about against each other on the deliberate fraudulent claims being knowingly incorporated into textbooks as we speak?  One will find the answer in the most unlikely of places within the scientific community: politics, grants, tenure, and other close-minded systems that are the antithesis of true science and the objective scientific method.<br />You get the gist of this book, and this is only the beginning.  One wonders why \\"science\\", a supposed objective search for truth through an objective and non emotional process like the scientific method would give rise to the outright lies, falsifications, and dogmatic close-minded belief systems held today by many naturalists, atheists and evolutionists.  Yet look no further than the negative reviews posted here for the answer.<br />If you have logged onto Amazon and are reviewing this book, pay special attention to the negative reviewers.  Anything like this book that speaks the truth about the lies and mistruth being sold today as \\"evidence\\" for their religion of naturalism, are always met with criticism and cheapshots, yet are often spoken without actually refuting the facts themselves.  It's true, the \\"emperor has no clothes\\" but only those who aren't part of his regime will admit it.<br />This is an important book, and is one that is written well, with a good blend of scientific substance, illustrations, quotes and narrative.  That it makes the belief system of atheistic naturalists look like Swiss cheese in the process is entertaining, almost as entertaining as the gymnastics displayed here by atheistic naturalists whose critical reviews are the desperate ranting of those trying to hold together the crumbling foundations of their religion.If you have logged onto Amazon and are reviewing this book, pay special attention to the negative reviewers.

Phillip Johnson has done an excellent job at aiming a logical, fact based, wedge into the illogical and faith centered belief system that is naturalism.<br />He starts the book with a familiar tale: one where a person raised with a belief in God goes off to college and starts questioning and abandons what he believes.  He gives a detailed and true depiction of Philip Wentworth's account of his conversion to secularism at Harvard.  What is fascinating is how he depicts with razor sharp accuracy the fact that Wentworth accepts his new beliefs without ever stopping to look at them critically, and becomes merely a flip-side version of what he was.  This rationalization which never resembles reasoning was fascinating to see analyzed. I found this to be an intriguing and unusual way to start the book.<br />The remaining chapters focus on a variety of the gaping holes in naturalistic belief.  His depictions of just what lengths these supposed objective scientists will go to remove all discussions of alternative viewpoints, illuminates that their objections are based solely on politics and a religious type of close-minded thinking.  Numerous examples are given to illustrate this fact.  As spoken by Darwinist and naturalistic follower John Maynard Smith, as he unwittingly describes the politics of his belief system:  \\"The evolutionary biologists whom I have discussed Gould's work with tend to see him as a man so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with, but as one who should not be publicly criticized because he is at least on our side against the creationists\\". (Page 139) These types of comments obviously fly in the face of what science proposes it is - an objective search for truth in which politics and subjective lobbying have no place.  Read this book and you will see that view of science is a myth, and the philosophy of the modern naturalist is protected at all costs, even if the process of doing so undermines the very foundation the belief system rests on.<br />The discussions on theology, and thinking, are masterfully done.  Like others before him, Johnson is asking the right questions, and due to his background and credentials, is scoring points at every turn.  The closed thinking of naturalism is starting to crack under the strain of simple questions and the reality of having a mirror held up to reflect back the badly damaged foundation of naturalistic religion.<br />The book is written very well, and incorporates both technical substance and smooth conversational dialog.  Highly recommended for anyone with an open mind who doesn't have a worldview to protect from the truth.lief system rests on.<br />The discussions on theology, and thinking, are masterfully done.

The information contained here is not original in concept, as many of the concepts can be found in (not surprisingly) successful and well know businesses.<br />The basic premise of this book is that the ability to attract, retain and engage the best talent available will give your business a competitive edge in the marketplace. Looking at these components in the &quot;war for talent&quot; the authors outline several strategies:<br />The first issue is that in order to be able to focus on talent, companies must &quot;embrace a talent mindset&quot; and realize that in this age of intellectual capital, getting the top talented people to work for you and your customers will make the difference in your results. &quot;Embracing a talent mindset&quot; means not just awareness of the importance of great people, but investing in development, setting high performance standards, and getting actively involved in people related decisions. In order to do this, companies must look closely at &quot;EVP&quot; or an &quot;Employee Value Proposition&quot; approach to keep top talent engaged in exciting work and value added opportunities.<br />The authors also discuss several different approaches to recruiting and identifying the key talent required for your business. In my experience, getting better talent up front makes all the subsequent processes better: training, communication, innovation, and of course business results.<br />The book also discusses a concept made famous by GE - differentiating performance and performers. While it sometimes feels like business Darwinism, differentiating your top performers and rewarding and investing in them accordingly will bring about better results than trying to raise the poorer performers up a level.<br />Overall, a great summary of the challenges and opportunities in this &quot;war for talent&quot; businesses are facing everyday.	2002-07-02

Lets start with some of the high points.<br />The book is well written, and I really liked the format.  The author lays out each chapter with clear writing, study questions and notes at the end of each chapter, and recommending reading, which is wonderful.  The fact portion of the book, namely the comparison of existing Biblical passages, is well presented and lets the reader come to their own conclusions.  The author has done his homework when it comes to presenting already well known scholarly theories like the famous, but non-existent, Q documents.<br />However, it is when the author tries to steer the conclusions with an obvious agenda that the book quickly deteriorates into a poorly reasoned version of the Jesus Seminar theories.<br />The first 6 chapters are presented well as described above, but the remaining chapters are clearly written with a faulty and biased conclusion already in mind.<br />For example in chapter 7 in the section &quot;Jesus Tradition&quot; the author inexplicably jumps into theories that are widely disputed by most Biblical scholars, by trying to read into the New Testament Gospels intent that is not supported by any credible evidence. For example he states that &quot;The evolving oral tradition made no distinction between the prophetic word of the lord and the word of the historical man&quot;.  However, previously in the book he outlines and compares many of the historical sayings and finds little dissimilarity among the different reporters and even goes as far as validating the differences as what one would expect from different viewpoints of historical and factual reporting.<br />His over-reliance on Gnostic texts and the work of the Jesus Seminar clouds what would otherwise be a pretty good and objective layout of Biblical information.<br />If you are interested in a comparison of Biblical texts, and considering some interesting questions about them, this book does a decent job of that for the first two thirds.  Skip the last third of the book however, as the author quickly demonstrates what happens when fact and fiction collide with poor results and illogical and biased assumptions.cent job of that for the first two thirds.

Second, the reviews here really piqued my interest.  For example when literary thinkers like John Zxerce review a book that looks on the surface as little more than tripe psychobabble, I take notice and assume there might be more to it.<br />Overall, I have skimmed the book, and plan to read it again in more detail, but there is some great information here, as well as some of the expected psychobabble that sounds good on paper but doesn't really lead anywhere.  An example of this is the section of homosexuality.  It was presented with an agenda, not as a realistic look into this issue.<br />The book is well written though, and I enjoyed, make that grimaced, at the thought of my daughter going through the school age gossip and cliques, and other potentially destructive issues teen girls face.  If you are raising a young woman, this is a good source of information, but not by any means should it be taken as an &quot;instruction manual&quot; as the views are often overly simplistic and also often carry a liberal agenda.  Good resource for identifying problems, just not solutions.	2002-05-26

Books	4	21	24	N	N	Outstanding presentation of Jesus and Paul	This book is a comprehensive presentation of the teachings of Paul and Jesus from the New Testament.  I liked the way the various concepts were presented and analyzed.  For a scholarly book, it is written in an easy to read fashion that contains enough detailed information for the theological scholar and is easily followed by the layperson.  The book basically blows the doors off the theological theory that Paul was unaware of Jesus and created his own version of Christianity.<br />The book is outlined in such a way that many concepts which are presented by both Jesus and Paul such as the Kingdom of God, the Christian Community, and the essentials elements of who Jesus was and claimed to be, are compared, contrasted and dissected against each other.  The result is that the author demonstrates that the absurd theories about Paul being unaware of Jesus life and teachings are unfounded.<br />It is clear after examining the evidence that Paul was presenting the message of the Gospel, and was in fact a follower of Jesus Christ and not the founder of a new Gnostic religion.  If you have heard these theories and are curious, please read this book.	2002-05-20

The book accurately depicts the passion the &quot;fish mongers&quot; have for their work, and if you are ever in the area, stop by and watch the fish and the verbal bantering fly through the air.  They really do live their work!<br />Now, about the story.  In this (very short) book, the author tries to spin a tale of a woman, recently widowed, who is promoted to managing the classic &quot;toxic&quot; work group.  Her objective: improve their performance and attitude.  One day while strolling through Pike Place at lunch she happens on the fish market.  The next thing we know, she is getting advice about how to re-energize her workgroup by using the basic principles applied at the fish market.<br />The bottom line of the story is that she applies the principles and changes the performance and attitude of her team.  The bottom line of the book is that it presents some great principles, dresses them up in a hokey and overly sappy story with a way too contrived ending.  Despite that, it is still a good story and the principles are sound.  From what I hear the video is much better than the book so I would recommend that first.	2002-05-20

There is not much here that is brand new, but what are presented are solid concepts and philosophies that help create employee loyalty and business success.  The book is an excellent and comprehensive look at the various methodologies to creating a company culture that attracts and retains great employees.<br />The basic areas of discussion are; Qualities and characteristics of a great corporate culture. Methodologies to diagnose your corporate culture. How to find great people, including solid tips on benefits, interviewing, new employee orientation, retention issues such as work/life balance, and leadership.<br />One of the more interesting and somewhat new approaches presented is the &quot;Organizational MRI&quot;.  Using the analogy of an MRI which looks deep inside a body for areas of concern, and organizational MRI is a process to look inside an organization for culture related issues which may impact employee loyalty and business results.  It is an interesting and somewhat unique way to look at a familiar process.  I also enjoyed the short section on the &quot;worst techniques to obtain reliable information&quot; which not surprisingly are used often in corporate America today.<br />The authors also correctly point out that the best way to create a great culture for success is to have the right people.  In my experience as an HR professional, I have found that the fastest way to change a culture is to hire the right people who will quickly impact those around them in a positive manner.  The book outlines several methods for interviewing and onboarding new employees to capitalize on what they can bring to the organization.  Also, the authors make the valid point of looking for talent within the organization as well. Not new stuff, but well presented.<br />Overall, it is a book worth reading.  The only real question is why more companies do not apply these time proven methods to build employee loyalty and business success.	2002-05-20

The book is written well and captures the authors thoughts and ideas succinctly.  Ultimately though the content goes in circles and he ends up presenting something not that different from any of the other books on leadership.  If one steps back and looks at the forest presented here, it is that in order to be an effective leader one need make good decisions, evaluate data carefully, think freely, posses both Machiavellian tendencies and play the role of servant leadership to one's followers, and one needs to communicate and listen well.  OK, so we have heard all of that before, so what is different?<br />Well, one of the highlights is a section on what the author calls \\"supertexts\\".  Great leaders ought to read the classics.  Really.  Forget newspapers and especially trade publications and read the story of Jesus in Matthew, the story of Paul in Acts, the story of Moses in Exodus, read Plato, Hamlet, Dante's Divine Comedy, etc., as understanding the human condition is far more valuable than the latest news articles or trade flash.  This is a radical concept and a rare one coming from a leadership and business approach.  It is summarized as \\"you are what you read\\".  A novel and unique approach on what enables good leadership.<br />I also loved the sections on \\"knowing which hill you are willing to die on\\" and the \\"art of listening.  Both provide an enlightened view of well-covered topics.<br />Overall, the book presents some great points but ultimately ends in the leadership paradox.  Few can really articulate this well and fewer still can solve this paradox in practice.  Books like this one often can derail effective leadership, which rely on a creative blend of all approaches depending upon the situation, by giving \\"sound bites\\" of information and directives which when taken out of context usually fail.<br />In the end it is a person's ability to successfully navigate the paradox of giving direction and empowering others, making quick decisions and waiting for more information, and driving others and serving others, which will determine their success as a leader.  The book implies this paradox, but throughout focuses on the trees and not the forest.ing direction and empowering others, making quick decisions and waiting for more information, and driving others and serving others, which will determine their success as a leader.

While I have never owned one, due first to not having the means, and now that I have the means it isn't practical for a family, this book is the next best thing.<br />The book chronicles the design and development of the Esprit, from its debut in the mid 1970's to it's recent development as a Turbo model in the early 1980's, to the new shape in the late 1980's, it is all here.  The photos are excellent and depict all model variations; including the rare &quot;JPS World Champion&quot; and &quot;Essex&quot; versions which are a tribute to the Formula One cars and sponsors of the Lotus racing team.  The book also depicts the racing success of the Esprit.<br />An excellent book for enthusiasts and admirers alike.  Highly recommended.	2002-05-05

Also contributing with comments are Marcus Borg, Robert Miller, and Ben Witherington.  As for the \\"debate\\" itself, Crossan's embarrassing lack of any ability to reason or provide any evidence for his views, and those of the Jesus Seminar, simply display how weak the position of the Jesus Seminar is.<br /><br />The subject of the debate is Jesus Christ, the message of the Gospel, and specifically the resurrection of Jesus Christ.  Crossan's main point is of course that the message of the Gospel and the words attributed to Jesus are symbolic, and do not reflect a real person or events.  While this position is pretty typical of those who attempt to undermine the Gospel, Crossan demonstrates that he has no basis for these beliefs.  Craig on the other hand provides excellent logic, reasoning, and evidence which verifies that in fact Jesus was a real person, and that the events of the New Testament were not only factual, but also meaningful to our lives today.<br /><br />The book is written well, with a variety of styles.  Both Craig and Crossan submit essays, and rebuttals, and the transcript of a debate between them, facilitated by William Buckley, is a fascinating exchange, and really defines the basic premises of Christians and those who oppose Christianity: the Jesus Seminar.<br /><br />Also of note are the essays submitted by others on the subject.  This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in what the true meaning of the Gospel is, and how far from it the Jesus Seminar is.  A great read highly recommended.	2002-05-05

If you are at all a fan of the show, you will love this book.  Who can forget Johnny Larue, 5 Neat Guys, The Days of the Week, The Great White North, the Sammy Maudlin Show, Bobby and Skip Bittman, and the VJ (before there were VJ's) Gerry Todd.  The satire is dead on.  The show just nails TV; the horrible vision that was the variety hour shows of the 70's, the newsroom, the &quot;sweeps week&quot;, and especially the commercials.<br />The book itself is a running commentary on the show, it's stars, the writers, and the various ways the show aired.  The photos are perhaps the best feature (who can forget Carl's Cuts with the pig-men) or the fact that Rick Moranis does Woody Allen better than Woody. Dave and Rick really do Bob Hope and Woody Allen so well it is scary.  The book runs in mostly chronological order, with input from the starts all along the way. However, some of the commentary is WAY behind the scenes, perhaps a bit too far back for the average fan.<br />Dave Thomas, the author, does an excellent job of capturing the egos, the infighting, and the creative styles of the shows writers and performers.  People often forget just how much talent came out of this ensemble: John Candy, Martin Short, Eugene Levy, Dave Thomas, Rick Moranis, Catherine O'Hara; all have had major roles in TV and movie comedy since their stint on SCTV.<br />The best features of this book: The photos and the quizzes at the end of each chapter.  The worst feature: too much information on the writers and producers behind the scenes and not enough info on what went in front of the cameras.<br />Overall, I recommend highly as a great look at the best comedy shows ever made.	2002-05-04

The authors attempt to demonstrate how much our lives are truly designed to be passionate, and drawn to God. There are two major themes: The first is that God desires a relationship with us.  The second is that our lives are often confined to the &quot;smaller story&quot; and we seldom play out the role God has in mind, choosing instead to go through the motions of daily events - devoid of passion and romance.<br />Often the depictions of God in the Christian Church cast Him in the role of a distant dictator.  This is the metaphor I grew up with.  A closer look at the Scripture reveals a God who is passionate and desires more than anything a right relationship with us.  The authors discuss this concept at length and provide Biblical backing for the theology.<br />The more compelling aspects of the book were the more practical.  A close look at our lives reveals our fears keep us trapped in the mundane, and keep us from risking the &quot;larger story&quot; we are called to be a part of.  We have lost the romance, the spark, and the adventure, of our youth, to be replaced with a cold logic and practical drudgery, and small stories.  The depictions of the hope and grandeur of our dreams from youth are depicted with such stark reality, that it jars you awake to the fact that so much of what we call maturity is a lack of trust, adventure, and passion.  There is a longing in each of us for something more, this book shows what that is.<br />An excellent book, but one that must be discovered on your own.  I chose not to go into detail in the review, as this book is not about the &quot;what&quot; of our lives, as some technical self-help rulebook would be, but rather about re-discovering the passion and romance we long for.  Take a risk, immerse yourself, and prepare to be awakened.	2002-05-03

The first time I read these books was when I was in grade school, and for years I could remember the story but not the book titles.  Finding them on Amazon and reading them again after all these years was a joy.<br />The author weaves a tale of adventure that will captivate young people and adults alike.  The perspective is that of a young boy who lives in a future Earth in which an alien race has<br />conquered earth and controls humans through mind control devices that force allegiance to the alien race and the Tripod machines they travel in.  Despite the technology of the alien race, humans live as they did in the middle ages.  The story is about this young man's journey and how teams of free young people, not under the influence of the mind control, try and destroy the alien cities and free humanity.<br />The books were written in the late 1960's so some of the symbolism of the decade reveals itself, although subtly.  The most powerful aspects of the book series are the depictions of the landscape and the alien city conditions and the coming of age of this young man.  The author captures the thoughts and emotions of this central character quite well.<br />The \\"newest\\" book, written as a prequel to the \\"White Mountains\\" series, was written well after the other three books and as a result has a different feel and tone. It is a \\"throw in\\" for the set, but doesn't add much value.<br />Overall, a fun and enjoying read for all ages.	2002-05-03

Mr. Beckwith discusses the many myths about abortion including the \\"back alley\\" arguments, and the many non-valid arguments used to justify abortion, as well as discussing the legalities, the interpretations of the law, the inconsistency of pro-choice support groups like Planned Parenthood, and the basic moral concerns for and against abortion.<br />The content is written in an objective fashion, with arguments raised, and research and conclusions stated and supported.  The research and sources used are excellent and very well documented and credited. Often the author will give credit to good arguments, and will challenge any illogic presented, by either side of the issue.  The research and source materials drawn from are as extensive as I have ever seen in one place.<br />Some of the more powerful arguments raised are in regards to the common arguments presented as a justification for abortion.  These include the misuse and deliberate falsification of \\"back-alley\\" death statistics that are used as a means to justify the continued killing of humans through abortion.  For example, one argument consistently postulated is the: \\"If abortions are illegal only the rich will be able to afford them through other means, and therefore this ruling will hurt the poor.\\"  One interesting counter argument to this stance is whether the affordability argument has any relevance at all.  For example, should it become legal to allow a person to hire a hitman as only the rich are able to afford the practice now? The answer would be of course - \\"no\\" - because the question of who can afford a hitman is not related to the question of its morality.  The same with abortion.  The question of who can afford them is not relevant to the question of the morality of the practice.<br />There is far too much information in the book to possibly address here, but the result is that the common myths perpetuated by the Liberal pro-choice agenda are consistently exposed as illogical and without merit. Again, if you are concerned about the morality of the practice of killing human beings based on the personal preferences of another then this book validates what you already know as common sense. If you have somehow bought into the pro-choice myths about the reality of what abortion is or does, you will find it impossible to read this book and maintain your position with any integrity, so powerful and logical are the arguments presented here.  An excellent book, with well presented objective data and arguments, and extensive research and source materials.mon myths perpetuated by the Liberal pro-choice agenda are consistently exposed as illogical and without merit.

The dialog and transcripts of his discussions with various \\"spin doctors\\" and his approach to facilitating a \\"spin free\\" zone, are excellent and a breath of fresh air to the stale liberal PC agenda that is today's media.<br /><br />However, it was with a little shock that I found that I had mistakenly purchased the excerpts of his book \\"The - No-Spin Zone\\", as opposed to the actual book. At least that is what must have happened because no one would charge 25 bucks for what amounts to \\"chats\\" and USA Today level articles on various topics.  Just as a topic was being introduced, he would tease me with a few bites of the transcript about the conversation, and then throw in 5 minutes worth of commentary and move on. For 25 bucks I expect the whole transcripts of these conversations, and much more in depth detail on his opinions.<br /><br />Now, having stated the obvious in his own \\"no-spin\\" style,  there were a few chapters that were well done.  The chapters on taxes, and Jesse Jackson were excellent.<br /><br />This book could have been great. If it was written to take advantage of the medium, namely that of a book reading audience, it might have had an impact on culture the way O'Reilly wants to.  His shows cater to the channel surfing, attention deficit person, whereas in a book he can explore ideas in depth and provide more behind the scenes analysis to explain what happens in front of the camera and why.  Sadly, the book was written to appeal to the same audience and anyone expecting to read some actual substance will be disappointed.<br /><br />Next time Bill, don't be so obvious in your attempts to squeeze a few hours of your work into money in your pocket, and instead at least make it look like you are laying it out and really putting out the effort.	2002-02-15

However, to say this is a work of journalistic expertise would be too high of praise - it is rather merely the stating of the obvious.<br />The book is written well, and flows smoothly in a conversational tone.  The examples used, statistics, and quotes from &quot;insiders&quot; validate what all of America realizes anyway - that our so-called &quot;news&quot; has been through a liberal and politically correct spin before it reaches our sets.  As is demonstrated by the interviews and quotes, this is obvious to everyone but those doing the spinning.  It is sad really because while they do not yet realize it, the Network anchors are on the downward slope anyway.  Too much cable, satellite and Internet competition has thankfully reduced the damage these liberal and biased actors can do to the reality they report.<br />I found of particular interest the sections on Dan Rather, the cowardly brown nosers posing as CBS news management, and how the liberal bias of these individuals slants the very way stories are told, and images are aired.  The sections on how race issues are covered up, and how statistics are inflated to help promote certain causes like AIDS and the homeless, were also fascinating to see actually put in print and proven.  The way that these TV personalities describe and label people they do not agree with, under the guise of neutrality, would be sad if it were not so unethical and lacking in integrity.  That Dan Rather would actually feel he is important, and more than just a recognized face, is even more amazing, and a testimony to how incestuous and out-of-touch these dinosaurs are.<br />I recommend the book for anyone who is not on the far left politically, as it will simply validate what you have watched with your own eyes for years.  If you are on the far left, be prepared to squirm as the obvious bias in the media is unfolded before you, not from a conservative Republican, but from a liberal Democrat with enough journalistic integrity to call it the way it is.emocrat with enough journalistic integrity to call it the way it is.	2002-01-21

I am a former employee of GE I will verify that while I was with GE I loved every single management direction Jack Welch gave, and this book accurately depicts the culture he strove to create.  Unfortunately, a few small steps down the ladder, it was not the same corporation he aspired to create.<br />First about the book though.  It is well written, flows quickly and easily, and is enjoyable to read. That being said, it always came up just a bit short of my expectations.  Getting some insight into Jack's worldview, childhood, career ascent, and personal interactions was fascinating.  However, every chapter is packed with information that could be expanded into a book itself.  For example, when he would discuss a business decision the narrative gave the impression he just had an \\"epiphany of common sense\\" and made it happen.  Jack states consistently, and it was true in my experience, that he was very detailed and analyzed data passionately.  The book leaves out most of this \\"meat\\" and the data behind his decisions and therefore reads too simplistically.<br />I was saddened to read about his family, or rather to be more blunt, not to read more about his family.  He devotes all of about a page to his divorce to his wife.  As another reviewer commented, maybe Jack was just practicing his own version of getting rid of the bottom 10% of his family.  In any event it is clear that while his own family of origin was very important to him, it is not clear he aspired to spend the same amount of time with his own family.  Sad, but a reality of the level of position he held and how he prioritized his time.  This to me was always his glaring defect of character, because what he did on the job was amazing.<br />His business ideas are brilliant, so brilliant that they seem like common sense until one realizes that they were new at the time.  While truly a business \\"Darwinist\\", his views on people created the type of organization that inspired people to put their all into their work.  It wasn't until I spent some time at other Companies that I realized how rare that is.<br />....<br />Unfortunately, most people in leadership at GE at my level had his books, his tapes, and his shareholder slides, but did not have his wisdom, his passion, or his courage.  The ideas he put into practice were brilliant in the hands of those who knew how to use them, and dangerous and dysfunctional to those who didn't.<br />Overall the book is a worthwhile read. I highly recommend it.  I would also recommend some of his other books which go into more depth about the management theories he inspired and developed.  While one may argue about the lack of work and family balance he creates, his leadership is legendary, and his results were unmatched.  I was proud to work for him and be a part of what he created.

The book is written well, and is researched thoroughly.  The footnotes alone are worth the read, but be prepared to want to buy several more books as a result of the excellent research.<br />The author starts with an overview of some classical writings including &quot;Pliny the Younger&quot;, &quot;Celsus&quot;, and &quot;Tacitus&quot;.  The second chapter goes into some of the classic Jewish literature that also refers to Jesus including the well-known Josephus passages.  While some of this was new material for me, there were no real surprises.  The information is presented well, with several commentary opinions regarding the passages.  The author presents the information in a mostly neutral fashion and will often present both supporting and opposing views on the writings and their significance.<br />The sections on the Canonical Gospels were excellent.  The focus is on the missing &quot;source material&quot; for the core Gospels.  The Luke source, identified as &quot;L&quot;, the &quot;M&quot; source which is reasoned to be part of the source for the unique material in the Gospel of Matthew, and the &quot;Q&quot; source for the sayings in Matthew and Luke.  In Luke this source material is referred to directly in the first chapter of the Gospel of Luke:  &quot;Since many have undertaken to set down an orderly account of the things that have been fulfilled among us...I too decided, after investing carefully from the first, to write an orderly account for you...\\".  This implies that there were &quot;many&quot; others who wrote down information about the life of Jesus and the Gospel message.  The other sources. \\"M\\" and \\"Q\\" are not as directly implied in the Gospels.  The chapter is well done, and is mostly speculative, as the alleged source materials obviously are not available to us.  Again, the information is presented well, and arguments and theories are postulated on both sides of the debate about their authenticity and relevance.<br />The last chapter focuses on the writings of mostly Gnostic origin, including the discovery of the Nag Hammadi writings.  The book examines the authenticity and relevance of these writings and compares and contrasts them to the Gospels.  The Gospel of Thomas is reprinted in full which is fascinating, as are parts of the Gospel of Peter, Secret Mark, the Ascent of James.  A writing conspicuously absent from the book is the Barnabas text, although this writing is widely regarded as a fraud in most Biblical scholarly circles.<br />Overall, a very interesting read.  The material was presented well, and was not dry but moved quickly and kept my attention throughout.

This book outlines the underlying spiritual message contained within the day-to-day existence and exploits of this working class family in an &quot;anytown USA&quot;.<br />The book was interesting and hilarious!  The author goes into some depth on a number of topics, including how the show depicts the Church, moral dilemma's, the Bible, Heaven and Hell, Christians, and even Hindu beliefs.  The chapter on the Bible had me rolling with laughter.  The writers of the show will often use actual passages form the Bible, as well as make up verses on their own. Many of these are outlined and explained in the book. The book spends some time on the evangelical family next door: The Flanders.  While the show often makes fun of Ned Flanders and his family, Ned is shown as having integrity, and to be a caring and consistent friend to Homer. There are several episodes devoted to moral decisions, including the Commandments: Thou Shalt Not Steal and Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery.  While the Homer and Marge are often tempted, they respond to these challenges with faithfulness to marriage and each other.  Certainly a rarity on TV these days.<br />While the book reads like a documentary and a scholarly study of the show, it is written in a conversational tone and is quite funny.  If you are even a casual fan of the Simpson's, you will love this book.  Who would have thought that this animated comedy would be a beacon of morality and family values?  The Simpson's may not be devout, but they have no question that God exists and intercedes in their lives.  A great show and a great book. Enjoy.	2001-12-10

Yancey writes in his usual conversational tone, with emotion and feeling.  However, the book is nothing like what I expected.  Frankly, I read it only on his reputation, and based on some of his excellent previous work.<br />The title of the book is very misleading.  In reality it is a series of essays on people who had an impact on his life including Martin Luther King, G.K. Chesterton, Paul Brand, Robert Coles, Leo Tolstoy &amp; Feodor Dostoevsky, Gandhi,  Everett Koop, John Donne, Annie Dillard, Frederick Buechner, Shusaku Endo and Henri Nouwen. After an initial discussion of his own Church experience in the South, and some honest, direct, and often disturbing revelations about racism and prejudice, he launches into the essays.<br />Each section is written as a critique of the person's Faith and impact of Yancey and others.  I found the sections on Paul Brand, Robert Coles and G.K. Chesterton, especially fascinating, as I had very little knowledge of their work prior to reading the book.<br />I would recommend this book, simply ignore the title and enjoy some wonderful insights into the Faith of some very interesting people.  While Yancy spends too little time on the effects of the Church to warrant the title of the book, the insights are worth the effort.	2001-11-14

Right from the beginning, I was uplifted and encouraged by the stories of hope and love that faith enables, and the personal accounts which leap off the pages.  The book is a very easy read, and one that can be picked up, left alone a few days and picked up again with little effort required to grasp the context.  The author writes in a very conversational tone and uses real life examples, opinion, scripture, and other writings to postulate the need for a fresh look at simple faith in God.<br />If you are a Christian already, or even have an interest in what Christian faith is all about, I suggest reading this book.  It is not dry or scholarly, but rather (as the title indicates) fresh and alive.  My only criticism is of the editing.  The publishers put those little text boxes on most pages with some text highlighted, so I would stop to read those, and then a few sentences later read the same text again; over and over again.  A small annoyance compared to the message though.<br />Buy this book today, and give your spirits a lift.	2001-10-20

This is an excellent book if you have an interest in our postmodern culture, and how Christianity fits into this worldview.  Specifically the challenge of applying a Christian worldview into a culture that has lost its foundations and is sliding down the slippery and illogical slope of moral relativism.  While there are many great books out there on this subject including &quot;Truth Decay&quot;, and &quot;Steering Through the Chaos&quot;, this book takes a different approach in that it contains dozens of short essays written by numerous apologetic authors and teachers, which are then combined into sections to form this book. Of particular interest to me were the sections on &quot;Critical Topics&quot; and &quot;This Relational Age&quot;.  The &quot;Critical Topics&quot; section includes a writing by James Sire, entitled &quot;Why Believe Anything at All?\\" a must read.  The sections on &quot;This Relational Age&quot; includes some excellent work on bridge building and the importance of developing relationships as a medium to carry Christ's message of hope.  I particularly enjoyed the fact that I could read several of these seven to fifteen page essays in a sitting and compare and contrast the different styles and approaches to evangelizing and &quot;telling the truth&quot; to a culture which is moving towards a belief that there isn't any truth.<br />I have deliberately kept this review focused on the style of the book and avoided overly stating my opinion on the subject matter.  Whatever your opinion is, you will benefit from the wisdom and perspective of the various contributors to the book.  A must read on the subject of apologetics and postmodern culture, and done in a way which doesn't require the effort and concentration level of most other postmodern discussions.  I recommend reading this book first to get some framework and then move on to &quot;Truth Decay&quot; or other more in-depth works on the subject matter.	2001-10-20

When the famous psychologist Alfred Adler was exploring how our identity is formed he made the following interesting and counter-intuitive claim:  Our present effects our past to a greater degree than our past effects our present.  This book, a journey through a lifetime of memories experienced again and bonds established for the first time, demonstrates that Alder's claim is often true.  The perspective we have today influences how we view the events and feelings of the past.  The author, Scott Sawyer, uses his present perspective to unearth a beautiful retrospective of his family and his fathers.<br />This book contains a wonderful journey, and those reading it will be blessed by the opportunity to experience it with him.  I was moved and touched, and the depictions and images involved me as a member of this family for a fleeting few moments.   I cried, I laughed, and I was humbled by the love that radiates off the pages.<br />The style of the book is more poetic than narrative.  I would normally have given 4 stars on this review, because I am usually more drawn to a narrative style, in this case however, the events, images and emotions of this family and his life captured me so completely that I quickly adapted to the many transitions and sound bites of thought.  <br />Please read this book.  I found that once I settled into the story, my efforts were rewarded, and the images and emotions came to life. I had the pleasure of attending a reading of the book by the author at a local bookstore and can tell you first-hand that the emotion that went into this project is real.  The scene was similar to the experience of reading the book.  We all laughed out loud at the comic depictions of his childhood, and cried at the emotion of meeting and losing his father again.     Highly recommended to everyone.	2001-06-26

The story is told in the first person, and reads as a running commentary on the incredible story of her adoption by King Muhammad V of Morocco, and her growth into adulthood as a victim of a failed coup attempt by her father; a general in the Moroccan Military and close adviser to the King.  Her story takes you from grief she feels being torn from her natural family and especially her mother, to be adopted by the King.  She describes the spoiled world of a would-be Princess, and her life in horrible prison conditions.  A study of extreme contrasts in lifestyles.<br />I found the story to be fascinating, the imagery of a world unknown in Western culture.  The emotions both touch and repel.  I found her attitude as a Princess in the palace to be disturbingly egocentric and spoiled, contrasted by the strength and courage she demonstrated while looking after her family in prison.  The depictions of the prison life, with the rats, roaches, sand fleas, and other poor conditions made my skin crawl while reading.<br />My only criticism of the book is that the editing is a bit choppy.  The story is so compelling, but it struggles to flow seamlessly from event to event often causing me to go back a few pages and see if I had missed a transition.  While this was frustrating at times, the emotional contents of the story overcome any weaknesses in writing style.  Some may even enjoy the journalistic approach.<br />I would recommend this book; it is an incredible journey.	2001-06-09

Scott Adams has nailed corporate America.  If you have spent any time at all working for a big corporation, you will find this book to be very funny.  The comic strips are always pretty humorous, but what I found also to be very funny was the text in this book, specifically describing the various corporate functions such as engineering, marketing, sales, and of course general management.  As a human resource director, I have often been referred to as &quot;Catbert - the evil HR Director&quot; (in a good way of course), by others who enjoy Adams work.  The way he describes typical business situations, like the ongoing balancing act between engineering products and marketing them, is eerily accurate, and very funny.  Unless you take yourself and your job way too seriously, you will not only enjoy this book but laugh out loud all the way through it. My only critical suggestion would be for Adams to stick to business related humor.  When he strays from that into other social commentary it is not as impactful.  Other than that, this is a great book!	2001-05-30

His business ideas, corporate philosophies and ability to make decisions on such a broad business scale is unmatched in recent American business history. Even his most vocal critics, who attack him on a variety of issues including corporate greed, and his profit at all costs mentality, are ironically attacking core American business values over the last 25 years, and Jack Welch is simply the best at carrying out that philosophy.<br />The book itself was a bit disappointing.  It reads like a series of one-page articles from Fortune or Forbes magazine, taking sweeping views of topics and interjecting some quotes and context here and there from Welch, and others in the industry.  In fact, a quick glance at the index shows much of the material used in writing this book came from those sources.  There are far too few revelations into his character, and why he does what he does.  I guess we will have to wait for his memoirs for the real insights.<br />A couple sections were fascinating though, including the chapters &quot;Dark side of the legacy&quot; and &quot;Welch's place in history&quot;.  In the &quot;Dark side&quot; chapter the author goes into some detail about some of GE's mistakes, including the Kidder Peabody fraud issues and some of GE's poor track record with environmental pollution.  Welch's reactions to such issues can be summarized by his comments regarding mistakes: &quot;I hope you understand that business is a series of trial and error.  Its not great science.  Mistakes are made. Its just moving the ball forward, and nobody has any great formula&quot;.  This type of attitude epitomizes his ability to always look for the forward motion and opportunity in every situation.  A great business strategy to be sure, but one that is used equally often when the results of the mistakes harm the lives of people, as is outlined in the chapter.  The chapter regarding his place in history is a great summary of his style and accomplishments, and how those are viewed by others within the context of American history.<br />The book closes with some fascinating information in the appendix.  Most people have no idea just how large and diverse GE is.  There are 13 pages in the appendix describing in one to two sentance bullets the number of companies in GE.  Amazing, especially when one considers that a great many of these would be Fortune 500 companies on their own.<br />Overall, this is a good book, and provides a good overview of Jack Welch's impact on GE, his successes and failures, and is honest enough to highlight some of the negative repercussion's that a &quot;profit first&quot; mentality can have on society.  There are many books on GE and Jack Welch, I would recommend this one first, followed by a more specific look at the particular business strategy platforms he instilled and executed.  &quot;Get Better or Get Beaten&quot; is one example of a book describing the business strategies he was successful in implementing at GE.place in history is a great summary of his style and accomplishments, and how those are viewed by others within the context of American history.<br />The book closes with some fascinating information in the appendix.

I live in Denver, and like most people here experienced the horrible event of Columbine High School personally.  The events of that day will be a defining moment for many of our young people.<br />In this book, a mother writes honestly about her daughter,  Cassie Bernall, who was a teen-ager killed at Columbine High School.  It seems there is some controversy over whether or not Cassie was actually killed because she stated her belief in God, but it is indisputable that she had turned her life and heart to following Jesus Christ, after some years of dabbling in witchcraft.  The book tells of a mother's concern, and the lengths she went to provide a stable environment for her daughter.  Like most teen-agers (how did any of us make it through those years without scars?), Cassie was searching for a sense of belonging, and ended up with a crowd of equally dis-enfranchised youths searching for meaning in dead end self destructive lifestyles.  Her parents went to considerable lengths to try to help her daughter through this period without causing too much damage to herself or family.<br />I was impressed with the honesty of this book, in terms of her parents.  The mother speaks of how hard it was to know what to do, and the risks all parents must take in further alienating their children by setting strong boundaries.<br />The book is well written, and flows smoothly.  With a little embarrassment I let tears run down my cheeks on the airplane while reading.  The story is very powerful. Ignore the reviews posted here by bitter cynical people looking for conspiracy, and read this book.  The book is honest, emotionally powerful, and touching.	2001-05-27

This is a book about the latter portion of the great Ayrton Senna's racing career. The book starts with a chapter on his death at the San Marino Grand Prix in May 1994. A moment I will never forget. In the USA where Formula Racing does not carry the same fervor that it does elsewhere in the world, the worldwide popularity of Senna is under appreciated - think Michael Jordan times 10! Overall, the book is written in a journalistic style with some interesting insights into his Formula One Championship years with McLaren and his switch to Williams for the 1994 season, however, the impact he had on the world and in racing was too profound and deep to be captured in a book this concise.  The most compelling sections of the book are the quotes from people throughout the world in reaction to his death, and the dialog concerning his incredible impact on fans and peers. While this book provides a good insight into his racing career, ultimately it is too narrow in scope and not deep enough to capture the genius that was Ayrton Senna, but it is a good place to start nonetheless. I would suggest one of the more in depth books on his life and career if you are interested in knowing more Ayrton Senna. Christopher Hilton is a good author and well-versed in racing, and does an excellent job capturing the inside world of Formula One.	2001-05-27

When I received the book I felt Jack Welch's ideas were simple, straightforward and obvious.  It is only after working for other companies that I realize the genius behind them, and how rare it is for these \\"simple\\" concepts to be played out elsewhere in corporate America. Jack Welch is truly a business visionary, and this book outlines many of his ideas, albeit in sketch format.  His ideas about re-structuring, de-layering, change management, corporate speed and employee empowerment were all way ahead of their time.  Thirty-one of his best ideas are presented here, but unfortunately, with little substance behind them.  I would suggest that this book is a great place to start if you are interested in GE's business and corporate philosophies, however, to get more in depth analysis and explanation you will need to look elsewhere.  I would recommend this book for a trip, as it is good airplane reading, and may spark some ideas for your business.	2001-05-23

I would not go so far as to call it a masterpiece by any means, but the topic is fascinating, the characters are mostly well developed and the story is engaging and hard to put down.  Essentially, it is a story about an archeologist who discovers Noah's Ark.  The discovery and excavation of the Ark is presented in a realistic way, as is the press reaction.  The truly intriguing aspect of the book is the impact this discovery has on the world.  Since the Ark is discovered exactly as it was depicted in the Bible, what does this mean from a theological standpoint?  The main characters are certainly impacted by this premise. This would make a great Indiana Jones movie, and as I read the book I kept envisioning the lead character as Harrison Ford.  In summary, I recommend the book, have fun and enjoy!	2001-05-23

The first half of the book goes into detail regarding the complex bio-chemical systems necessary for life. I found these sections, while interesting, to be as dry as most college textbooks. Thankfully, the second half of the book is so well written and compelling that it makes it worth getting through the detailed science. The book basically addresses the unanswered questions and flaws in Darwin's theory of evolution including: how this theory has been regarded as fact when the requisite scientific studies are missing, and how a reasonable conclusion of the scientific method as we know it points to &quot;intelligent design&quot; in the formation of these complex bio-chemical systems.<br />First, the author exposes the flaws and holes in Darwin's theories, and states: &quot;The impotence of Darwinian theory in accounting for the molecular basis of life is evident from the complete absence in the professional scientific literature of any detailed models by which complex biochemical systems could have been produced&quot; (page 187). Also..&quot;Molecular evolution has never addressed the question of how complex structures came to be. In effect the theory of Darwinian molecular evolution has not been published, and so it should perish.&quot; This section is why I titled this review - how science (evolution) became mere faith. The other reviews I have read posted here show surprisingly great many emotional reactions to these questions from persons claiming to be scientists or at least evolutionists. While evolutionists may not &quot;like&quot; the fact the answers to the bio-chemical questions do not exist, their negative reactions are hypocritical to their cause. The fact that science is by definition an unemotional empirical search for truth, the survival of evolution flies in the face of the scientific method, as we know it. The author demonstrates just how far this illogical conclusion has come by citing hundreds of textbooks that point to evolution without any supporting scientific evidence fundamental in any real scientific conclusions.<br />Second, is the concept of &quot;intelligent design&quot;. The author discusses both sides of this argument, presenting some great analogies, including the famous &quot;found watch&quot; analogy. The author states on page 193 that &quot;The conclusion of intelligent design flows naturally from the data itself - not from sacred books or sectarian beliefs. To a person who does not feel obliged to restrict his search to unintelligent causes, the straightforward conclusion is that many bio-chemical systems were designed.&quot; The examples and analogies used throughout the years are discussed, with arguments on both sides of the fence well presented and argued.<br />Later, the author goes into some of the philosophical reasons why these basic questions remain unanswered, and why in spite of this the scientific community is reluctant to look elsewhere for hypothesis.<br />Overall, this is an excellent book to read. While occasionally dry, the second half really hums with arguments and counter arguments flowing freely. I enjoyed the philosophical debate. I would recommend this book if you have an open mind, and are truly a scientist or someone who seeks the truth, regardless of where that truth might come from. If you are philosophically sold on the idea of evolution, despite the lack of scientific foundation, skip this book and stay comfortably numb, after all your conclusions require nothing of you.of textbooks that point to evolution without any supporting scientific evidence fundamental in any real scientific conclusions. <br />Second, is the concept of &quot;intelligent design&quot;.

If you have an interest in animals in general, especially wild animals we will likely only see in zoos or on TV, then this is a great read.  Despite a somewhat weighty topic, the book flows well in an easy to read style, packed full of examples and anecdotes.  The chapters on how zoos are progressing from the cages and bars of the past to the \\"natural habitat\\" format are extremely well presented.  Also of particular interest were the sections on how animals react when confined, and how zoos are experimenting with changes in the environment to stimulate the animal's mental health, with mixed results.  Overall, this is a great book, and the author has done an exceptional job at presenting the topic.  It will change the way you think about zoos, and the animals that inhabit them.  Buy the book if you can find it.	2001-05-16

Frank Peretti has established himself as an excellent writer of fiction (see This Present Darkness), as well as non-fiction (with the Wounded Spirit).  In this book he tackles some hot social issues through the story of a man's journey of awakening to who he is and what he stands for.  The social comments regarding the media, and the way news is spun to meet the agenda's of the (usually liberal) owners of the media outlet, is right on the money and reflective of what we have seen recently in the 2000 Presidential race.  In this story, the topic is abortion rights, and the plot involves a news reporter's choice between doing what he believes is right, and keeping his job and status as an anchor.  The story is well written, and once you get a chapter or two into the book, it is hard to put down.  I gave this book three stars in comparison to his other works, but it is an excellent read and well worth the time and effort to do so.	2001-05-15

This story is a complete departure from the usual Grisham law formula, and the results are wonderful.  After years of sometimes great, sometimes cliche, and always entertaining lawyer dramas, Grisham suddenly decides to write a book about a 7-year-old on a poor cotton farm in Arkansas.  The story comes to life.  It is told in such a simple, compelling way, that it captures you in its innocence and honesty.  I found myself not wanting the book to end because I was so in tune with this 7 year old and his view on life and the struggle for survival against the elements for this poor but proud family. The best way for me to describe the experience would be a &quot;snapshot in time&quot;.  It would like looking closely at an old grainy photograph of some people and wondering what and who they really were - and getting the chance to find out. If you haven't purchased or read the book, wait for the paperback.  I give the story and the writing 4 stars, but deducted one for the outrageous price of the hardback version.	2001-05-15

The book is essentially correspondence between a Father and Son, in which the Father asks dozens of tough questions about his Son's faith, all in letter format (including the small talk and pleasantries).  Among the questions are &quot;Why believe in God in the first place?&quot;, &quot;Why would an all powerful God need prayer?&quot;, and dozens more about the Bible, the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, and Christian doctrine.  What makes this book so compelling is the honest way the questions are posed, and the answers delivered.  The son (Gregory Boyd) answers these tough questions with logic, theology, science, and uses a straightforward approach which is neither &quot;preachy&quot; or &quot;academic&quot; but rather grounded in everyday language.  In particular, the section on &quot;Why believe in God in the first place&quot; addresses the fallacies of &quot;random chance&quot; theories such as Darwinism's evolution.  For example, the Son poses the question back to the Father regarding all human longing for meaning and a supreme being by saying &quot;Where did our longing for something that never existed, and that never could exist (if we are a result of random chance) come from?&quot;  He presents some questions which atheists and evolutionists have been skirting and simply have no answer for.  Overall, the book is easy to read and will challenge the way you think about Christianity, and the rational, logical, and even scientific conclusions which all point to God.  It also demonstrates a rare feat these days: a passionate debate about a serious subject, handled with maturity and love.  A great example for anyone who engages in theological discussions with persons who have strongly opposing viewpoints.  Buy this book and read it - it is worth the effort!	2001-05-12

The book states right off that it is real, not fiction, and since I love his fiction work so much I expected something very different. But I was mistaken; the book grabs you from the first sentence.<br />His autobiographical tales of school age terror were depicted with harsh reality and deep sadness.  I found myself emotionally caught up in the feelings I think almost everyone can relate to: feeling rejected and hurt by others.  In this case, physical abnormalities led to some cruel treatment, the feelings to which were depicted with stark reality.  This is really three books in one.  The first section is the autobiography. The second topic is the subject of WHY people treat others in such a cruel manner, including some compelling arguments against moral relativism highlighted by correlations to the Columbine incident.  According to the author (and myself) it is strange that moral relativism is becoming more and more accepted as a valid philosophy, yet these same people who believe there is no moral truth, since all truth is relative, are shocked by what happened at Columbine.  The author asks: Isn't Columbine a natural result of that philosophy?  Was what happened there&quot;wrong&quot;?  Since everyone agrees that it was &quot;wrong&quot; then why was it wrong?  Wouldn't there have to be a moral code by which to even judge the tragedy as \\"wrong\\"?<br />He closes the book with some excellent thoughts on how teachers, parents, and all of us can support each other.  He illustrates in some powerful ways how the spirit, once wounded, stays wounded for a long time! The arrows of hurt, the taunts, the words of ridicule, wound our spirit and those wounds continue to hurt us indefinitely unless we turn them into something positive through forgiveness.  He uses the movie &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; as an example of what we are supposed to do morally. When the soldier at the end answers the statement by his fellow soldier of \\"we did nothing wrong\\" he says \\"yes we did, we were supposed to fight for those who couldn't fight for themselves, we were supposed to fight for Willie&quot;.  If you have not seen the film, please do so.  A great illustration of his point that we need to stand up for those who are being hurt and protect them, as even small gestures of humanity can enable change.<br />Overall, a very powerful message of hope and redemption, well written and supported.t by his fellow soldier of \\"we did nothing wrong\\" he says \\"yes we did, we were supposed to fight for those who couldn't fight for themselves, we were supposed to fight for Willie&quot;.

In simple terms, it is the idea that there are no absolute truths, and therefore can be no absolute morality. \\"What is true for me, may not be true for you\\", \\"all religions may be true for that person\\" and other such platitudes.<br /><br />The book does an excellent job at blowing holes in this illogical, hypocritical and hopelessly flawed viewpoint. For example, the author looks at several key areas which illustrate the flaws of this movement.<br /><br />1.  People who espouse moral relativism, are inconsistent, as they have a moral view themselves. While they strongly object to someone \\"forcing their morality on them\\" they are in fact doing just that to others. There can be no neutrality, as the author points out. The easiest way to discover what their moral center is, is to violate it in some way, at which point it will be easy to see that they truly do not believe that morals are simply relative.<br /><br />2. To examine a philosophy's merits, look to the people that represent the pinnacle of the philosophy as it is lived out.  For Christianity, this would be Jesus Christ.  For Hindu's this may be Ghandi.  For Civil Rights activists, Dr. Martin Luther King.  But if we looked at a person who TRULY lived a philosophy of moral relativism, the best example would be a socio-path.<br /><br />3.  For all the rhetoric of \\"tolerance\\", Moral Relativists are actually saying something quite different. The viewpoint of \\"political correctness\\" is not a neutral one, but rather a moral worldview which is being enforced through various means, including slander, and social criticism, led by biased and (ironically) intolerant leaders and activists.<br /><br />The book is written in a style which is easy to read, and which confronts directly the flaws in this popular movement.	2001-02-20

I recommend this for any man about to be married or enter another phase of their life.  The authors describe how men have fallen, and throw a new (for me) twist into the old Adam and Eve story.  Instead of depicting Eve as being deceived and then subsequently deceiving Adam, the book describes that Adam was there the whole time, yet said and did nothing. (Hence the book title: Silence of Adam.)  The book goes on to describe many different ways men compensate for their weaknesses and inability to have all the answers by often acting in ways which harm themselves and others.  What struck a deep chord with me is the way the book describes how to react or act in those times when there are no answers.  The chapter &quot;Men Who Fight Darkness&quot; was especially powerful in that it depicts the harm in trying to fix something, or act, when the only way out is to trust and be still.  Typically, my response to situations which I cannot resolve is to try something, anything.  I resist being patient and waiting for situations I cannot control to unfold naturally.  The book illustrates some excellent examples of the damage this causes, and the healing and success a different approach may bring. I liked the way he described how &quot;We begin to face the loneliness of choice, the terror of trust&quot;.  In the chapter titled &quot;Recipe Theology&quot; the author describes common responses like being a recovery addict (&quot;How can I FEEL better&quot;?) or a grim legalist (&quot;How can I DO better&quot;?), and how we &quot;either become pre-occupied with feeling good or we feel pressured to do good.  Neither lifts us up into God's larger story or invites us to participate in it&quot;.  Very challenging words.

I had recently spent some time in Portofino, and was given this book to read.  I picked it up because of the title location, and discovered the same feeling the town in Italy gave me: Once I arrived I never wanted to leave.  The story is so well written that it captures moods and feelings perfectly.  The moods range from the embarrassment of sexual &quot;reaction&quot; in front of a girl, to the fear of a Father with a temper, to the warm breazes and lush smells of Italy.  I laughed out loud at Calvin's interpretation of the fundamentalist Christian beliefs of his family.  The often absurd and totally dogmatic views of the &quot;us vs. them&quot; fundamentalist Christian are depicted with amusing accuracy, right down to the &quot;thees and thous&quot;.  The strange melding of love and intolerance, accepting and rejecting of those who are different was wonderfully depicted.  I do not know how it could be done better.  A funny, warm story, and a wonderful experience.	2001-02-10

I picked up a copy recently for some airplane reading on a long business trip, and found the magic had not diminished in the least.  The first time I read this book I was in high school, and after starting it, I read for almost 10 hours straight because I simply could not put it down. I even resorted to faking an illness to get out of school the next day to finish reading it. Terry Brooks has a style of writing that brings pages and people to life in a clean, always flowing, manner. The only aspect I found difficult is that the story splinters about halfway through the book into several different storylines occurring at the same time.  This was difficult because one storyline would be so gripping I would find myself wanting to skip ahead and continue the story thread I was in. The book just flies by, and while Tolkien might spend five paragraphs describing a particular place (with a breathtaking result), Brooks inspires a similar response with an economy of words.  The story has enough plot twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat, but it is his development of the lead characters which got me hooked.  The story involves the pursuit of a magic sword by some rather unprepared heroes (Shea and Flick), who must find this sword and save the world from evil forces.  In this story the heroes are aided by some occasionally one-dimensional warriors and friends, and battled by the usual fantasy world creatures like trolls, gnomes, and spirits.  While the other members of the group all have significant skills and represent the best of their races, the two heroes are depicted as &quot;regular guys&quot; who do not understand their significance in the battle for the future of this world.  Therefore, they often react as a &quot;normal&quot; person would and in such a way as to make the book seem even more real, and more engaging as a result. A truly wonderful book, and a great hidden message in the power of the sword, and the faith required to use it. I love all of Terry Brooks work, but this book is in my opinion his best.  Pick up a copy and enjoy, you may not be able to put it down, and at over 700 pages you do get your money's worth!word, and the faith required to use it.

I find that I do not always agree with him, often think he is completely &quot;out to lunch&quot;, sometimes think his ego is out of control, but am always entertained and engaged by his style.  The book, like the show, is simple: Mr. O'Reilly talking about his opinions on a variety of subjects.  The book is a easy read to say the least.  The type of book to buy at an airport, read on the plane and still get 45 minutes of good sleep!  This is not a deep book, however that does not mean that he doesn't occasionally really nail something.  The first chapter on social class opens with an admonishment of Jesse Jackson that basically say's Jesse is barking up the wrong tree.  The REAL problem in America is not race, but social class.  He gets this dead on correct in my opinion as well.  Other chapters such as those on Dating, Parents and Religion are little more than his opinions, with little substance to back his views and read like he was being paid by the chapter and had to fill some space. I will say this about Mr. O'Reilly, he is very open of those who are critical of him.  The few times I have tuned into his show, and while reading this book, I was amused and impressed by the self depreciating way he gives those with a harsh and critical opinion of both him and his viewpoints open airtime.  That is very refreshing indeed.  Most political writers, Liberals and Conservatives alike, rarely if ever want to draw attention to a contrasting opinion.  O'Reilly does this often and in ways which are both funny and illuminating. I compare this book to the USA Today, you never walk away feeling as though you have benefited from the time spent reading it, but you are always entertained while doing so.	2001-01-28

Larry Elder writes this book with an direct hard-hitting style and posture. He uses a balanced combination of opinion, philosophy, and statistics to back his claims. I will say that I found the first several chapters on race issues to be fascinating.  Larry writes about race issues from his own perspective as an African-American regarding the present state of race relations in America, and makes some excellent points. The subject matter is worth talking about openly, and if not for the comical and tragic &quot;political correctness&quot; movement of the Left, would likely open many lines of communication and improve race relations. If you are at all interested in this subject I strongly suggest you read this book.  The liberal platform has actually (according to Larry) done far more damage to African-Americans than the supposedly racially biased political Right-wing views and policy.  A must read.  Sadly, the book goes downhill as it progresses, which is not to say it isn't well written, just - in my opinion - divergent from his logical stance in the first half.  His take on legalizing drugs and gun control are way out to the Right, seem to defy common sense at times, and also appear to contrast with his views on race relations - when looked at from a non-political viewpoint.  Overall an interesting book, and worth the read if just for the sections regarding race relations alone.  The title is not misleading, although I would say it should more accurately state &quot;The Five Things You Can't Say in America&quot;, as about half of his Ten are not that controversial, just well disputed.	2001-01-28

He spends some time speaking of the Apostle (he uses the term Saint) Paul's statements concerning love, specifically \\"Now abide faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love. Make love your aim\\". He says that many religious people make faith their aim, and faith is exclusive, not inclusive. I couldn't agree more.<br />From a macro viewpoint, he makes some excellent points about America's role as a compassionate nation, highlighting the injustice of our poor, and he really has some wonderful things to say about the role of evangelism by saying that good evangelism is not proselytizing but witnessing, bearing witness to \\"the light that shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it\\". Amen!<br />However, his philosophy is lacking on the whole due to his often subtle and often direct conclusion that only those individuals who agree with his socialistic liberal views are capable of demonstrating the \\"love as the greatest aim, and love as inclusive\\" concept. For example, he says on page 17 that the \\"Christian right has trouble not only seeing love as the core value of personal life but even more trouble seeing love as the core value of our communal life\\". While I do not consider myself a member of the Christian right, I find his pushing of the superior exclusivity of his liberal political views to contrast oddly with his own statements about his desire to live to love, and therefore be inclusive. How does one be inclusive while being exclusive of others? A self contradiction he seems unaware of.<br />In conclusion, this book presents some wonderfully powerful challenges to Christians regarding our role in society, but it ultimately cannot seem to make the claims without at the same time being the very thing it condemns; exclusive and unloving.  The book itself is NOT a \\"little\\" to the left. The statement on page 72 illustrates just how far off center he is: \\"Clearly the Christian right is a tribe that feels slighted. I think we should oppose its views -- vigorously\\". This type of viewpoint places his views on the far left, not moderate as the title would imply.llustrates just how far off center he is: \\"Clearly the Christian right is a tribe that feels slighted.

Frank Peretti writes in a style that is engaging and suspensful. He weaves together a plot involving both a human struggle of philosophical and political agendas, and the spiritual battle occuring at the same time between the spiritual forces of good (Angels) and evil (Demons).<br /><br />It is this weaving of the plot between everyday issues and spiritual long term agendas that is the most compelling reason to read this book.  The spiritual battles come to life in such a vivid way, that you may never view your life in the same way again!  The images of how the spiritual battles are waged between God's Angels and the principalities of darkness, and how people are used for purposes beyond thier personal agendas, are presented in a manner which turns the perception of current events into something perhaps more than they appear to be.<br /><br />The book starts a bit slow, seemingly the day in the life of a small town, but once the plotlines start coming together you won't be able to put it down.  The main characters are developed well, and are presented as real people who could be our neighbors.  It is fiction all the way, so don't expect an academic thesis on the supernatural and Biblical themes of spiritual realms, simply enjoy the story and the message.<br /><br />I have given copies of this book to dozens of people and have not had anyone, Christian or Athiest, not enjoy the story.  I highly recommend this book, as well as it's sequel:  \\"Piercing The Darkness\\".	2000-11-28

It is written in an easy going, conversational style.  While I love that type of writing because it captivates and draws me in, others expecting a more &quot;academic&quot; approach may not.  Brennan writes as though he is writing just to ME, and the message he is sending has even more impact as a result. The message presented here is a simple, clear statement of love and grace given freely.  The author makes references to AA meetings, a place where grace abounds due to the truthful honest reality of failure. The truth shall set you free.  That truth is the reality of who we are, with all the posturing, image, and carefully crafted exteriors blown away, and the reality that it is that truth that God loves, accepts and embraces.  In a particularly impactful segment, Brennan describes the heartbreaking and shocking process of a man's illusions being shattered, and the freedom and change that comes as a result of accepting God's love and grace from that place of true honesty. This book will shatter the illusions of many Christians guided by rituals, laws, and all the unfortunate illusions that keep us from seeing what is right in front of us - God's free gift of grace and acceptance, as we are, who we are. Many previous reviewers of this book have mentioned that it seemed that Brennan's continued message of grace might constitute some sort of absolvance of responsibility for behavior. I did not see this presented here.  There is no one who has much trouble with behaving in ways they wish they didn't, however most of us have considerable trouble in accepting ourselves and loving ourselves as God does in spite of those lapses. We are who we are.  And God loves and freely extends grace to us where we are, who we are.  This is a great book!  I thank my friend Craig for giving it to me, and will pass it on to others.  What a difference it would make if I truly lived with the daily assurance of this message, in place of the fear and works based faith that so often creeps in.so often creeps in.	2000-11-09

These are some very direct and honest questions that I have had myself, and have heard as some of the main reasons why people often have rejected Christianity. While this book does not have all the answers (and who would expect it to?) it does provide some great insights from a variety of sources that put these questions in context and provide some relevant information which I had not previously considered.  I am impressed with the honesty and the way the author, and the experts he consulted, did not dodge or attempt to deflect away the accusations or tough material.  I won't give away the conclusions here, because the book is excellent and should be read on its own, but I will say that I came away from the experience with some questions answered to my intellectual and emotional satisfaction.  The book is in no way &quot;stuffy&quot; or dry, and is well worth the effort!	2000-10-28

Yancy again writes a book which says what so many of us think.  He writes about the doubts, the questions, and the soul searching which is part of any relationship.  What is remarkable about this book is that while he addresses honestly the ups and downs of a relationship with God, it is written in such a way as to be encouraging and helpful.  Like a friend who listens, supports and challenges without being judgemental, Yancy has illustrated a maturity lacking in most &quot;Christians&quot; who sell quick fixes and leave the daily realities of faith under wraps.  If you are a Christian, this book will challenge the way you think about your faith, and be encouraging in the process.  If you are not a Christian, this book will help illustrate what its all about in a way that is open, honest, and never &quot;preachy&quot;.  An excellent read!	2000-10-11

Books	3	3	7	N	N	A well written book	I liken this to any good work of fiction, and as fiction, it is excellent.  However, if you are expecting some sort of an accurate non-fiction documentary, skip this one and keep looking.<br />Throughout the book, the author's use very well known ploys that are successful marketing and lobbying tactics.  Take irrelevant and non-correlated data points, and then weave them together with a tapestry of fiction to try and make them appear as if they are connected. The attempts to try and correlate the Gospel message and life of Jesus Christ with other pagan religions are an example of \\"spurious correlation's\\". It makes for some interesting reading, and conspiracy junkies will love it, but it ultimately falls well short of demonstrating anything other than the amount of data the authors studied. It also ignores the vast majority of places where the Bible does not correlate with these other \\"pagan religions\\". Was it accidental that this was left out?  No, of course not, its just part of the scheme.<br />One glaring example of this type of spin was the section titled \\"Gospel truth\\". The authors claim that since the Gospels have contradictions, they must be false. Huh? The authors fail to mention that this was apparent to anyone who has read them, including the Council of Trent, where they were included in what we have as the New Testament, so if the stories were falsified, why not correct them into one cohesive, non-contradicting story? First, one must assume they were included in their original message, despite the contradictions, because they were true. The reason is obvious to any forensic psychologist: stories, which do not contain differences and contradictions, are deemed less valid and more likely to be collusion. Put it this way, if 4 people witness a car accident and they all describe what happened differently due to their unique perspective, would we conclude the car accident didn't happen? This is the conclusion the authors are implying, again falsely.<br />I give the book three stars because of its exhausting research, and that it is indeed an entertaining work of fiction, but the premise and conclusions are merely the biased and slanted agenda of two men, and fail to hold up under even the most casual observations.  Anyone looking closely with an open perspective can see through the lobbying easily, so why does it work so well for so many reviewers here?  The same reason that the tobacco companies are successful at spinning all the health risks away as part of some elaborate scheme by do-gooders or the government.  People buy it because they want to.  Only those people without a vested interest in the fictional premise here, or those who want to wish away accountability and ignore truth are buying it.  Which one are you?  Hint, if you bought the premise of this book ask yourself WHY you wanted to be so fooled so much that you chose to ignore the obvious flaws of logic.give the book three stars because of its exhausting research, and that it is indeed an entertaining work of fiction, but the premise and conclusions are merely the biased and slanted agenda of two men, and fail to hold up under even the most casual observations.

It is a work of fiction which tries very hard to appear objective. While some of the research is interesting, the premises are so far fetched, and full of holes that the  conclusions lack any plausibility whatsoever.  The authors will take bits  and pieces of information, weave them together with \\"perhaps\\" and  \\"this could be an indication of..\\", or \\"one might  assume\\" and then use these \\"facts\\" to form the foundation of  even more theories and hypothesis.  The faith required to beleive anything  in this book is exponentially higher than the faith required to believe the  book it tries to refute - the Bible.  If you are looking for a work of  fiction and if you can completely suspend your disbelief while reading, you  may find it interesting.  However, if you are looking for some factual  evidence against the Bible, you won't find it here.	2000-07-24
