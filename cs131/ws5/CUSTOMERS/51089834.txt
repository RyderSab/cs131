He scours all portions of the Bible to show us what the Bible actually says about money and how it impacts our spiritual and temporal lives.<br />His book is not a survey and it is not a concordance. It does not deal with every mention of money in the Bible; but Miller helps us examine the way that we relate to the use of money and the purpose of our money. This small book helps us to examine our relationship with God and our relationship with money. It is the sort of no-frills and attentive book that Miller, a church consultant, is known for writing. Good to have someone offering a commonsense examination of the Bible's teaching on money.	2004-02-16

Melchiorre helps move us through and beyond the commercialism of the Christmas season to a sense of Christmas as a time to reach out to others in service as well as to reach out to God in prayer. <br />Melchiorre connects Bible passages with real life. I appreciate his insights into life in the city. I also appreciate the way he connects these Bible passages and contemporary reflections with the traditional music of Christmas. I've listened to Handel's Messiah, but always that music has been tied to sentimentality. After reading this book, I will hear that music from the perspective of a great incarnational faith rather than simple traditionalism.<br />This simple book has a great depth of spirituality to it!	2003-11-12

Wolpert's writing shows that he practices what he has set to paper.<br />Some older prayer traditions feel understandable and comfortable to use after reading Wolpert's book. Some creative prayer understandings make sense, e.g., the idea of group journaling and praying with nature. I especially like the way Wolpert identifies creativity as prayer. Of course God speaks through creative expression! There's also good news about the body--as in body prayer! Wolpert speaks graceful words to our often negative understandings of the body (or at least how we seem not to measure up to magazine cover standards). <br />This book is rooted in Christ, in the teachings of the Bible, in Christian tradition. It helps us open spiritually to God.	2003-09-04

His stories, like koans, take us on the road of discovery to gain a sense of the self within, the sense of self that lives beneath the many artifices that we construct. <br />His stories are short, quiet, meant to be read slowly, and especially, to be read one at a time. Do not read this little volume in one sitting, though certainly that is possible. Rather, read one story, chew it, savor it, and understand how it connects with your life's journey.<br />Griebner's stories evoke in me Dag Hammarskjold's words of gratitude:<BR>&quot;For all that has been--Thanks!<BR>To all that shall be--Yes&quot; (*Markings*, p. 95)	2003-02-28

He preached at British coal fields as well as in urban centers. 53 of his sermons became known as the Standard Sermons and were used as teaching tools.<br />Paul Chilcote distilled the 18th century language of Wesley's sermons (which might take an hour or more if read aloud) into 53 lyrical prayers. Very accessible. Very real. Very much in tune with the language of today's heart. These are prayers to pray daily and weekly, prayers to let grow from the lips and travel to the mind and the heart, prayers to become a part of the soul. Chilcote's work updates Wesley and continues to speak to Wesley's concern for the spiritual formation of all people.	2002-07-30

Too much is going on and I'm tired at the end of the day, but this book's premise is based on my scenario--and the ways all families operate today! We'll be able to pick up the book, turn to the day's devotional, read it together, do the suggestions, and enjoy ourselves as a little church.<br />The devotions are biblically based.

I have kept a spiritual journal regularly for the last seven years (and sporadically for the last 25 years). Broyles' suggestions gave me new insights into journaling and new ways to reflect on this journey.<br />I'd compare Broyles' work to The Joy of Cooking. Broyles, like the cookbook compiler, offers a multitude of options, then stands out of the way and lets the reader-writer reflect and cook with that reflection. <br />I've especially responded to Broyles' material on dreams and find this material a valuable companion. The suggestions for journal dialogues--with others and with self--are also creative and wise.	2002-07-01

Simply taking the time to read and reflect and rest in silence with her guided prayer meditations allows me to hear the still small voice of God.<br />Most of Dr. Bohler's meditations are based on the four Gospels, episodes in the ministry of Jesus. She does include prayer meditations based on some Psalms and other Old Testament books as well as some of the New Testament epistles.   I used one of the meditations with a church youth group. Dr. Bohler uses a meditation from a noncanonical Gospel. The meditation worked very well with the kids in the group, then they wanted to know where the scripture was located. &quot;Gospel of Mary.&quot;  &quot;What's that? You mean the Song of Mary? The Magnificat?&quot; &quot;No, the Gospel of Mary.&quot; That led to conversation about the criteria for inclusion within the canonical ranks of scripture. Good conversations about the importance of scripture and the kids are continuing to read and reflect on the scripture and to study the history of scripture and the church. Excellent for a church in an urban setting!	2001-08-07

Others have written about this theme--Thomas Merton in Reading the Bible, Adrian von Kaam, Susan Muto, and Robert Mulholland in a variety of works. And yet, none gain the reader's attention as Dawson does.<br />Consider Chapter Two, the encounter between Jesus and a crowd set on exacting punishment from a woman who had broken the Law (for the biblical account read John 7:53-8:11): &quot;I stood in the ring of condemnation. The circle was drawn tight by the crowing people who gawked and jeered at me. I could feel them pressing, but they did not come any closer than about ten feet....&quot; Dawson describes the effort of a mob to condemn the woman, the intervention by Jesus, and then continues this first-person narrative: &quot;I stood alone in the empty ring. The words he wrote were still in the dirt, though the road dust was quietly eroding the letters....'Neither do I condemn you.' The words sounded in my head again. No condemnation....The circle of condemnation had become a ring of grace.&quot; <br />Dawson's reading of Scripture pulls readers into the text and offers Christlike spiritual guidance. I read it for myself, but think it would make an excellent book for study groups.	2000-10-27

Elizabeth Canham offers a wisdom of spirituality that is grounded in the classic practices of Benedict, and she helps readers understand that the spiritual practices described by the 6th century Benedict were intended for ordinary working people. Canham structures the book so that we begin with Scripture and then we move to that essential Benedictine spiritual practice of hospitality. Prayer is a foundational discipline that Canham covers, but her conversation about other practices is a treat.  She writes with an ease and charm as she yokes manual labor and rest, two spiritual practices that are misunderstood spiritually. <br />Canham seasons her work with her life's experiences. She grew up an evangelical Christian in England and is now an Episcopal priest in the US. She lived in Manhattan and in a monastic situation in rural South Carolina. These experiences make visible the very Benedictine understanding of life as pilgrimage. Her work is well informed. Her understanding of Benedict's insights allow me to take up these practices in a life in which I fend off chaos and disorder. And that seems to have been a part of Benedict's vision in the disorderly 6th century.	2000-10-25

J. Marshall Jenkins makes the salient point that spiritual practices seem right and easy and appropriate on a Sunday, but  much less so on a work day or a day in which we face all the stresses of  life. He describes that typical weekday and points to ways in which  spiritual practices undergird all that may happen. Jenkins is well aware of  biblical stories and uses these throughout the book. He is also a  psychologist who uses psychological insights to serve the larger purposes  of Christian spiritual practice. And he has a nice sense of humor. A good  read!	2000-05-04

Because I did  not know anything about them, the saints I enjoyed reading about  were  Clarence Jordan, Martin Niemoller, and Karl Barth. I am surprised by these  because they are not the norm.

As he explores a variety of facets of  this elusive entity called community, Doughty offers insights into the  spiritual pilgrimage and experience that creates community, temporary and  permanent, elusive and perhaps eternal. His musings on what prevents  community from happening are pivotal in an analysis that is as personal as  it is communal.

Hinson approaches spiritual formation from the very best sense of classic Christian praxis and the academe. His passion and energy  communicate throughout the narrative. I'd call it &quot;cutting edge&quot;  but Hinson stays within the great and forgotten traditions of the church  universal.<br />Perhaps most telling is the way in which Hinson illustrates  spiritual practices by writing of his own experience. For example, in  writing about keeping a spiritual journal Hinson excerpts from his journal  two very different responses as they illumine his spiritual journey: the  first entry concerns the horror and revulsion experienced in a visit to  Auschwitz and the questions concerning suffering and God; the second entry  concerns an ecumenical gathering in Jerusalem. Throughout the book, Hinson  weaves praxis and theory, offering the best kind of spiritual  teaching.<br />His work is gentle. His teaching is kind.

Instead of the effort to control God that so many in the church seem to have, Hinson reminds readers that life in God's community is one filled with surprises. <br />Hinson's book bridges a gap between a popular piety and a more academic perspective. His scholarship is evident. His own devotional life is recorded in the book by way of example. His work may not be popular because of his decidedly liberal stance concerning sexuality and yet, Hinson's book deserves a wide reading within the church.	1999-12-21

In some ways Cronin's work is for Christian  spirituality what the work of the agrarian movement (the authors of  &quot;I'll Take My Stand&quot;) was to the world of literature. This book  is a worthy contribution to both the academic world and to the everyday  world of theology and spirituality.

This book is a daily treasury of wisdom, one that helps begin the day focused on God.  Such a beginning maintains the focus throughout the day. <br />Richardson is a  liberal Protestant minister. She is very comfortable with the Wisdom  traditions. This is a great source book and introduction as well as a daily  guide.	1999-08-23

(The prayer concern for March 3--as I compose this--is for Law- and  policy-makers, a concern for all of us.)<br />The late Dr. Samuel D. Proctor  wrote an introduction to this book, and it is good to have his  wisdom.<br />The book opens flat for easy writing. Good to put on a table and  not worry that your page is lost. <br />This is an excellent book! I hope that  many people will use its suggestions and be guided to a deeper prayer life.	1999-03-04
