I don't know what  books it competed against, but  this one is clearly a winner.<br />I read this  book some time ago and will re-read it soon.  What I liked best was the way  the two main characters related to each other to achieve their goal.  A  young 15 year old still fighting for the south and a tough young 18 year  old girl, ala Scarlet O'Hara AFTER the war (&quot;I'll never go hungry  again!&quot;) but more likable.  If you're looking for a detailed book  about the civil war, this is not it. If your looking for some new insight  into Stonewall Jackson or some secret about why the south lost, this is not  it.  In fact, the novel succeeds because it is more a &quot;period  piece&quot;, an action story of ordinary people which just happened to take  place in the 1860s.<br />It is a book for all ages and I would especially  encourage women, young and old, to read it as Kathleen is a strong willed  heroine that I was happy to read about.<br />Thank you for evaluating my  review.	2000-09-01

The book failed me and left me feeling tricked mainly because it started  off so good and the title seemed so promising.  While everyone may have a  story to tell, the lesson of this novel may be that most people would  rather not waste their time reading about these stories unless they have  something new or interesting to teach us about life itself.  The  &quot;short-story-ness&quot; of the book wasn't so bad but it was not  really tied together by a unifying theme.  So many of the stories broke  down into sex for sex's sake and didn't really relate to &quot;love&quot;  unless the idea is that sex is the &quot;Feast of Love&quot;.  For example,  &quot;slurpees&quot; on the 50 yard line at UM stadium; oral sex in the car  while driving on the way to get married (with emphasis on not spilling a  drop) -  Why?  How does this relate to the &quot;Feast of Love&quot;?  It  almost seemed like I was reading an old Penthouse Forums magazine.  I had  many unanswered questions about the relationship of the characters and felt  I learned nothing about love.  I would not recommend this novel.	2000-09-01

I was let down.  It wasn't a waste of time to read.  I think the  charachters were developed well.  Maybe, the emotions and actions of some  are from an earlier age (1940s or 50s) or from a different place (NOT  Manhattan), but I would like to think there are still real people who feel  and act the way the charachters in &quot;A Walk To Remember&quot; did.<br />I  guess my biggest dissapointment was this is an old story line and unlike  &quot;The Notebook&quot; - Sparks didn't really approach it in any  different way that hasn't been seen before.  Having just come from  &quot;Autum in New York&quot; - I can use that movie as an example.  Same  set up with characters, i.e. boy and girl who seem most incompatible - a  big age difference in &quot;Autum&quot; as opposed to the religious thing  in &quot;Walk&quot;, fall in &quot;love&quot; then face death of the girl.   But in the end the male characters do the same thing, which is very  predictable - fairy tale-ish.  What if the girl had gotten better after the  marrige and not died?  I would have liked a different approach, somewhere  in the story.<br />Thank you for evaluating my review!	2000-08-12

Responding to my inquiry during a  happy hour conversation: &quot;so, have you read anything interesting  lately?&quot;  I don't think I ever read a &quot;romance novel&quot; before  this one and if it had not been for my friend's follow up inquiries and the  shortness of the book (plus she gave the book to me the following Monday),  I would have missed out on a real treat.<br />Now, I'm no expert on this kind  of novel and I'm no great literary critic, but it was a great book.  The  part that got me most wasn't the classical love story of lovers from  different sides of the track, falling in love, being seperated but finding  each other in the end.  This was well written and not too mushy. Except for  his name  - Noah, the male was a real &quot;he-man&quot;.  The most  touching part of the book was how devoted Noah remained throughout his  wife's illness, moving in with her, reading their story each and every day  even though she had no recollection of him or their lovely life together.   Anyone who has had to care for a sick spouse or parent will really relate  to this part of the book.  Anyone that has experinced Alzimers in a friend  or loved one will be amazed at the depth of Noah's love.  Unfortunately,  it's not something seen very often in real life.<br />It's a fast read, but  very emotional even if you are not use to having your emotions stroked by a  book.<br />Thank you for evaluating this review!	2000-08-11

But this book gives you some basic information about what a day trader does, how  she/he does it and the emotional stress involved in such a job choice.   Even a person who has only recently begun to trade using the computer  online or otherwise can really associate with the feelings described in the  book.  Recently, some stock prices have shot up and crashed down in the  same week or even in the same day.  Living and dying on such a  rollercoaster has got to take it's toll.<br />This is not a &quot;How To&quot;  book and I'm sure there are better technical books out there or historical  bios on some of the main players.  But this was also a really funny book.   It was a book that even people who are not regular reads of the Wall Street  Journal or Barrons (like me) will really enjoy reading.  It will also make  you feel better that you have a nice, steady, borring job that pays you on  a regular basis and lets you sleep pretty good at night.  That is a pretty  rare commodity for &quot;Day Traders&quot;.	2000-08-09

The author uses an interesting combination of looking back, 30 years to when the two married victims first met, looking foward from the instant of death until the  victims are finally found and taken away and looking back, hourly on the  last day of the victims life.  The time lines are mixed well and this  device really encourages the reader to think of how every day is, or very  well could be our last.  I found the most interesting and really troubling  time line, the last day, hour by hour, from the victims sleeping, to their  waking and on as they move on to their eventual death, unknowing,  unsuspecting of the violent death awaiting them in the place they first  made love, in the dunes.  I thought the vivid and scientific detail of the  decomposition of the bodies too much and except to really make you  understand you are nothing but dust, unnecessary.<br />It was a depressing  novel to read [with M]any unanswered questions....	2000-08-08
US	49591788	R22HFGJCKOLZ51	0553580639	424334838	Maiden Voyage	Books	4	2	2	N	N	GREAT SECOND NOVEL	The main reason I read this book was because I enjoyed this author's first novel so much (&quot;Sherman's March&quot;).  I also am a bit of a Titanic fan ever since reading, &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot; as a kid.  As the  other reviews point out, this is not a Titanic fanatic's book.  It's closer  to the Jack and Rose story from the recent movie, &quot;Titanic&quot;.  But  it also discusses the often overlooked and under appreciated social issues  involved, such as class distinction and &quot;women and children&quot;  first.  The Titanic went down before the World Wars and the many inventions  which came along.  It was a time of unreal riches (before an income tax!).   Bass really captures the feel of that era and weaves the characters in a  very entertaining way.  You will not get the details of the sinking of the  ship (see a &quot;Night To Remember&quot; for that).  But you will get a  better feel for what real people might have felt and experinced at this  time in history.<br />It is an enjoyable read.	2000-07-18

And normally, he doesn't know it.&quot;  With lines like this throughout the book, it makes very spiritual reading.  It  made me think about what my life dream is, what my &quot;Personal  Legend&quot; is suppose to be and how I am to know it when, and if it ever  comes to me. The book seems to over simplify things like this.  The young  boy learns what his life dream or Personal Legend is literally in a  recurring dream and then it is confirmed by meeting various people who  clearly are &quot;messengers from God&quot;.  I don't think you have to be  religious to enjoy this book but it clearly mirors the New Testemant and  the teachings of Jesus.  But in the end, the hunt for his  &quot;treasurer&quot; is material in nature, gold, jewels, etc. and this  seems to be an ending at odds with much of the body of the book.  I also  didn't get into the magical portion of the book, turning into the wind, for  example.  However, in the age of Harry Potter, this might be a very  attractive book for young readers.<br />It's a quick read and I found myself  really thinking about some of the lines, even underlining many.  Well worth  the time and effort.	2000-07-13

I listened to the book on tape and found the  narrator very good.  Stone's ex-partner and his father-in-law the mob boss,  are colorful but not believable, but neiter is Stone. Does he really have  to have sex with every single female character in the book, including Dear  Abby and the bad guys sister?  What's with the Carrington/Barrington bit -  kind of goofy.  But anyone that picks up a Woods novel isn't looking for  Shakespear are they?  Its quick, fun and Stone, Carrington and the rest are  generally likable characters.

Probably the most captivating two sentences I have ever read.  I really enjoyed the first half of this book.  Having never read Carroll before and  not even suspecting where he was going, it was like hitting a brick wall  when ghosts, reincarnation, animals talking and other &quot;strange&quot;  stuff started happening.  I don't find this at all scarry, I guess because  I don't believe most of it is at all possible.  It is pure fantasy.  I need  some believability to enjoy my stories.  I continued reading, hoping it  would get back to some kind of reality, but it never did.<br />There were  however some really excellent observations, some worthy of quoting by  someone, somewhere.  There's one on how dogs show people what life is all  about, eating, sleeping, going for walks and peeing when you need to - real  good.  I loved the reunion scene.  I got lost in the ending.  It was just  too weird, but after reading the other reviews, that's what you guys like  and enjoy so - eat it up.<br />Re-read those first two lines and tell me they  aren't some of the best two lines you have ever read!	2000-06-29

It was interesting learning about all the  police procedure, but sometimes it got a bit too detailed, like a Tom  Clancy book.  It was the kind of tape that I found myself being less upset  to be in traffic so I could listen to more of the book.  It might be too  graphic and gross for kids under say 13 or 14.

But, the &quot;why&quot; - is not  fully addressed.  She makes an attempt at the end, but give up without  really trying, just asking the questions.  The book is great in its  description of a spouse learning of the sudden death of the other, but  lacks in any detail as to why the husband would do what he did.

I picked up the unabridged version in the library (11 tapes) and although I usually preferr unabridged versions of books on tape,  this one might be a better one to listen to in the abridged version.  I  think it is best geared for those with a serious interest in the Civil  War.<br />It is humerous and parts of it reminded me of &quot;A Walk In The  Woods&quot; by Bill Bryson, though not nearly as funny.  I want to know how  you get a job like Horwitz and Bryson have, wandering the country for a  year or more, meeting interesting people, seeing great sites and writting  about it for money.  This has got to be one great job.<br />I didn't really  like the narrator of the unabridged version although I didn't hate him.  I  enjoyed learning about reenactors and if you have ever seen a reenactment  you can really appreciate what these people go through, farb or hard core  alike.  The Wargasm seemed a bit silly, just going to some of these spots  like a scavenger hunt.  It is a usefull way for Horwitz to give you alot of  Civil War trivia, much of which most Civil War boors should already know.   I definitely learned some new things.<br />It was also interesting to listen  to Horwitz' view of the current climate in the South as to race issues and  the fight (still being fought) over the rebel flag.  Horwitz may have  over-done this portion of the book at least to the extent that he seems to  argue that the South is still fighting the Civil War.  A look at today's  national political landscape might make one believe the South won the Civil  War. G.W.Bush [Texas] or Al Gore [Tennessee] our next President; Bill &amp;  Hillary Clinton - especially Hillary taking over the Empire State! Just  imagine what Lee and his fellow generals would say about a governor from  Arkansas as President (all those character issues aside) and his wife as a  Senator from New York. Able to vanquish the absolute worst of the Yankee  scum without a single southern bullet or rebel yell!<br />In the end, the  South, as with the rest of the country, is dealing with issues of  &quot;race&quot; and &quot;hate&quot; which, unfortuanately, has not been  resolved and will probably be with us for some time to come.	2000-06-08

To book was great and the tape would be great for a family on a long trip.  I also like the movie very much. The audio tape holds your attention and would probably  hold the interest of kids 12 and up (for those soon approaching summer car  trips).  The narrator was excellent.<br />This is a great book for people who  want to know what law school is like - the last year and especially for  those students (75%) who aren't one of the top students.  Most people don't  realize how hard it is for the majority of graduates to get good jobs after  finishing law school.  Not only does Grisham write accurately about law  school, his story of the typical lawyer (not the white shoe corporate  types) is also right on target.  Finally, there are so many million dollar  cases that never collect for all kinds of reasons and Grisham really tells  a story of how frustrating being a young, inexperinced lawyer can be at  times.  For all you &quot;learn&quot; in Law School, you know very little  about how law is practiced in the courts everyday.  Armed only with truth  and a just cause, is simply not enough.<br />The book should be required  reading for anyone thinking they want to be a lawyer or to really get an  understanding of what most young average lawyers go through.  It really is  like this!	2000-05-26

Yet no one can  seriously question that the content of the book is great - easy to read,  educational with out being booring and thought provoking in today's world.   You do not need to be a Civil War boor to enjoy this book.  After finishing  the book, I was faced the the truth that our generation (myself included)  is truely unaware and uneducated in the classics.<br />Just as tens of  thousands of Southerners died not to keep slaves (most soldiers had none),  but for their belief in a states' right to remove itself from the Union, go  it's own way without the North or anyone else telling it what to do  (exactly what George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and those Sons of  Liberty in Boston had done only &quot;four score and seven years&quot;  before [and which is why the &quot;rebel flag&quot; has little to do with  race or prejudice]), tens of thousands of Northerners died to keep a united  country -  not to free slaves.  Yet, after all the death and destruction  and personal loss, which seemed to climax or reach a &quot;high water  mark&quot; on those 3 days in July, 1863,  Lincoln understood - and here  Wills really excells, that the War had a much bigger meaning than simply  deciding a political question.  He raised the stakes at Gettysburg and  perhaps that move is what ultimately decided the question.<br />Besided the  background and history, ALL Americans, North and South should read the book  with the end of Lincoln's speech in mind: &quot;that government, of the  people, by the a people and fore the people, shall not perish from this  earth.&quot;  Had so many not died for that concept, H.L. Menkin probably  would not have had the right to write and say what he did.  Had the South  won its right to independence would member states of the CSA withdraw when  an impass was reached?  Would we have 2, 5 perhaps 50 seperate countries  today, ala the USSR and its Republics? How would WWI &amp; WWII have been  different?  With two countries, the USA/CSA - perhaps one might have  remained on the sidelines or perhaps a CSA would have supported the racist  views of Nazi Germany? Clearly world history would have been very different  in ways no one could begin to know and perhaps the government we enjoy  today (warts and all) would not exist as it does.  Those who wish it were  different can take heart by considering the current national political  scene: G.W.Bush (Texas); A. Gore (Tenn.); B.&amp; H Clinton (Ark.), etc.,  etc., etc...	2000-05-24

This is a great book for a number of reasons: first time novel (are usually really good - this is no exception); short (214 pages); short but organized chapters; great character development; great writting about long  distance swimming; good lessons.<br />I had trouble with a few things like,  Audrey thinking her husband was cheating on her with such flimsy evidence  (none).  It's like she had to believe it whether it was true or not so she  would feel justified in having her own &quot;fling&quot;.  I think the real  motivation was her age but she was fairly young (32) with only 1 young  child.  The real motivation for her wandering eye could have been developed  more.  Did her experience in her family (divorced parents) contribute and  maybe her current relationship with her parents?  I wanted more explanation  of the &quot;why&quot; - a few gray hairs on a 32 year old in great shape  was not convincing.<br />The shallow relationship between Audrey and Sean, her  lover, was odd.  The story would have been better if they were more  &quot;involved&quot; not just a one time thing. It was a bit unbelievable  how he comes out of nowhere at the end: was he stalking her?  Sean seemed  to be looking for more than a &quot;quickie&quot;.<br />In the end, the  children are the ones that pay the price of parents infidelity and this is  a sad tale of exactly how high that price can sometimes be. <br />If you have  swam laps, you will really relate to the discriptions of what happens  mentally.  Perhaps this was Audrey's biggest problem, too much quiet time  in the pool thinking about things she should only have been thinking about  in her 40's.	2000-05-24

The way the autor describes the feelings of a spouse suddenly learning another has been murdered (or killed accidentally)are written about and narrated in such a real why, one  can almost feel how it must be like.  You really think about how at any  moment your life could be altered drastically by the death of a spouse or  other close relative or friend.  It is a horror no one would want to really  experience but the book seems to capture how a widow or widower might  truely feel.  The relationship between Jill and Carrie is also beautifully  written.<br />Then the book goes nowhere.  The criminal investigation of the  husband's murder has none of the normal &quot;crime suspense&quot; novel  traits.  Jill's trip to London wanders, as does the book and too much time  is wasted.  Who cares about her college love live and her abortion and what  does it add to the story?  The ending was poor to terrible.  The results of  the criminal investigation are dissapointing to say the least. The  &quot;love affair&quot; between Jill and David Resnick, the person in  charge of the investigation, is forced and lacks depth.  With all the  detail of Jill we get nothing of Resnick to explain why he might be  &quot;chasing&quot; Jill.<br />The book grabs you in the first 50 pages (which  is why I even gave it 2 stars) and holds you up to  1/2 way.  But I felt  tricked into finishing it and except for some interesting comments at the  end concerning infidelity and marrige (the murdered husband's secrete  infidelity and Jill's complete ignorance about it could have been developed  much more), the second 1/2 of the book was a waste.<br />I really liked the  title as well as the cover, which is primarily why I chose to read the  book, but I don't feel the title was &quot;explained&quot; at all - which I  think is unfair.	2000-05-21

Abortion (which was quite illegal at the time,  punishable by jail time, stiff fines and loss of the medical license)is  only one of these issues treated in both the movie and the book, but the  book does a much better job (to no surprise).  Incest, infidelity,  pre-marital sex, homosexuality, patricide, racisim - the &quot;rules&quot;  relating to these subjects, as well as how the characters deal with facing  and breaking these rules is what is the most powerful aspect of this novel  to me.  As to abortion, it was a different time and I wonder if Homer Wells  would still be an abortionist in the post-Wade years?  I felt horrible to  read about women attempting their own abortions and dying in the process,  but I felt un-sympathetic to the &quot;I just give them what they want, an  orphan or an abortion&quot; attitude of Larch. That is too simple.  Was  Homer, Fuzzy, Mellinie or any of the others just &quot;an orphan&quot;.   While Homer was &quot;converted&quot; from a &quot;pro-lifer&quot; ala  Mario Cuomo, to an abortionist, I doubt the book will change anyone's  opinion on abortion.<br />The book will make you think deeply about other  &quot;rules&quot; and how the characters break them and live with the  consequenses.  The relationship between Homer, Candy and Wally was unique  and a bit unbelievable and I would have liked to hear more about how Wally  and Angle &quot;reacted&quot; when they were told the whole story.  Or did  they already know? Probably.<br />It's also one of the few long books on tape  (17 tapes) that holds your attention and would be a good book for adults as  well as children 13 and older.  Pick it up for those long summer car trips.   <br />Apparently, the characters and the situations are related toreal  people and real procedures.	2000-05-17

This is the book for anyone that has an interest in hiking, even if not &quot;through hiking&quot; the AT.  But it is so much more.  You learn about the environment and the Park  Service without pain.  I listened to the book on tape and almost had a few  accidents as I had to pull over from laughing so hard at times.  The  writing is great and the book moves.  I want to listen to it again, but I  know I will want to leave my job, family and comfortable life and hit the  trails.  This is one of the best books I ever read (listened to).	2000-05-12

I have an 11 year old boy named Danny and the beginning of the book really is great at describing the passions and fears a parent would  probably have if they were ever faced with this situation.  The middle of  the book slowed down a bit but still gave a good sense of how the  characters in such a horrible situation might react.  The end was just  crazy and I was dissapointed.  Here is a great line: &quot;Nothing we fear  gets realized, but while we're distracted, worse things happen.&quot; It's  a fast read with short chapters.  I don't know how a story like this could  have ended and in the end I guess no ending to such a sad story would  suffice.  It is worth the effort but don't expect too much in the ending.	2000-05-12

Did we have such an advantage over the USSR? Would our alies have sat back and watched?  Who would the world powers have been in the  aftermath?  I think it would have been better to describe actually what  occured in '62 and explain in the alternate history version what went  wrong. The author could have done this when the hero went to NYC - maybe he  could have run into someone that could explain in more detail why things  turned out the way they did.  This could have been a great chance to  explore exactly what went right, what JFK and others did that helped avoid  a war.  In reading this book you get the real impression that it was simply  the toss of a coin that made the difference between war and peace.  I'm not  a big JFK fan but from what I know of how the crisis was handled, this was  one of his brightest moments.  The turncoat girlfriend was also predictable  and goofy.<br />P.S. For a good &quot;alternate history&quot; novel on the  Civil War - check out &quot;Guns of the South&quot;.	2000-05-04

The first 20 pages are a bit strange and I was tempted to return the book before it really started.  I'm glad I did not.  I guess it is a bit unreal in todays society to find a young man like the main character - but this is a work of  fiction.<br />This is a good summer book to read on the beach and then start  planning on giving notice.	2000-05-04

I read this book over a year ago and don't recall details such as the names of the characters.  A friend suggested it and the only reason I kept reading it and finished it was to try and see what she liked about it.<br />The setting is the back country up north, like Up-State New York or  Mass. or maybe New Hamphshire or Vermont.  The main characters father was  the son of a rich tycoon and was a Senator for years.  The Grandfather made  all the money and is the most interesting character.  The story never  really tells you exactly where it occurs which becomes frustrating because  the story is told in a way that makes it sound like a real place and real  events.  Most of the story is about the fight to stop the federal  government from putting up a damn right in the middle of Grand-daddy's  country estate (which he basically stole from the Indians - the damn would  put his &quot;little piece of heaven&quot; under water, and which has  become the home of most of the family clan, sort of like the Kennedy's Cape  Cod compond.  The main character and his girl-friend/wife eventually  prevail but the woman dies in what is only understood as a suicide  involving the damn.  The main character then &quot;moons&quot; the  President (who was the Governor of the State when the fight over the damn  was brewing) and then runs for President himself, as the fresh face in  Washington, the real &quot;people's canditate&quot;.<br />The book takes the  form of entries in the main character's journals both past and present so  there is a lot of jumping around and too much unnecessary detail.  It's  just too long to get to the point.  The book begins and ends with a  constitutional crisis being reported by the &quot;Dan Rather&quot; of the  country at this time -  the Election of 2000 (I think).  The problem is the  people's candidate who bares his but as a form of political protest is not  35 years old (the minimum age required by our Constitution).  No one in  power wants this &quot;kid&quot; with no experience and no manners (sounds  like Slick Willie to me) to be sworn in as President.  I still don't know  what my friend saw in the book.	2000-05-04

The main character &quot;Lissa&quot;, finds herself falling in love with a man she  meets while serving on jury duty.  It's a bit of a problem for her as she  is married although going through serious marital problems.  The source of  these problems are all due to her boorish husband of 10 years who is  resentful of her success and freedom in starting and running her own  business.  He wants her to have children and hates her mother and the very  close relationship between mother and daughter.  The trial Lissa sits on is  not real interesting although it could have been developed into something  much better, maybe some kind of take-off of the &quot;OJ Simpson  Trial&quot;.  The defendant, a down and out actor in England, kills his  wife in a fit of rage (ala temporary insanity) The wife clearly deserved  some sort of punishment for her beating on her husband, both physical and  mental. Lissa's mother is a beekeeper and the reader gets some interesting  information about bees and honey but the stories never really come  together.  Lissa's love object/boy friend describes their first kiss as if  he were &quot;drowning in honey&quot; thus the title. It is one of the  better lines in the book.<br />Unless you are interested in the civil justice  system in the UK, stick with Grisham for legal suspense.	2000-05-03
US	49591788	R37VWJTLIRZ7OV	1882593189	470902331	Free Reign: A Suspense Novel	Books	1	1	3	N	N	LAWYER BASHING CANADIAN STYLE	The only reason I got through this book is because our plane was 2 1/2 hours late on our return from vacation and the plane trip was 4 1/2 hours.  True, I could have read about the safety features of the Boeing 757, but there's someting wrong about reading 1/2 a book and not fininshing it  off.<br />Half way through I was sick of the judge-turned- vagabond's endless  trips back and forth to the Don valley hut where this judge was living. It  was interesting to imagine such a great fall for such a powerful person but  you aren't told why this fall occured until the last 5 pages!  That was  very frustrating.  Even worse, the whole plot changes and ends up so  fantastical as to be beyond belief.  The writing was good and I really did  like the main character and his description of his past and struggle for  success.  By the time you are told why the hand ends up in the judge's  garden (actually, I still don't understand it) and how the judge's friends  are harvesting unborn children for medical treatment (the saddest thing is  that this is actually happening) your sick and tired of the whole group.  There are also unnecessary sub-plots, like a hurricane in Toronto?  Is that  actually possible? Even if it is, who cares? Why waste 20 pages or more on  this? Then you are never told about characters introduced in the book like  the judge's wife and son.  We only learn about his daughter who is now an  attorney herself, and this is only in the last paragraph or so.<br />I  wouldn't waste my time reading about this judge who falls from grace.  Just  read the daily newspapers, there are enough good stories about lawyers and  judges loosing it all.  Let this be a lesson to those flying:  always have  plenty of GOOD reading material!	2000-05-03
