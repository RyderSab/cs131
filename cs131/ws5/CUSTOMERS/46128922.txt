Well, this book will show you all the things that the Casting Directors and the Powers-That-Be go through to find the right Cast for a TV Show or Movie. I never realized how complicated it can be, and this book was a real eye-opener.<br /><br />Just reading about the casting of \\"Friends\\", and the failed pilots some of the actors were in before they hit it big - well, it just amazed me. And that Lisa Kudrow almost ended up on Fraiser instead ... wow....<br /><br />If you are an Actor, this book will give you a better understanding of the side of the Biz that you never see. I highly recommend it.	2005-06-10

There is a younger son who has his own problems.<br /><br />The teenage son comes back as an angel to help guide his family. It is especially touching that his mother can see his spirit and talk to him about what is going on. The relationship between the mother and the spirit of her dead son is very moving.<br /><br />It is also interesting to see how Johnny Angel deals with his  girlfriend moving on with her life after his death. This to me was a very interesting part of the story.<br /><br />But the rest of the characters and events weren't really developed. Johnny comes back as a spirit to help his family, but the story is not told with any depth. I would have like to have read more about what the father was going through as he dealt with his issues. Instead, the story is focused on the relationship between the mother and dead son.<br /><br />I did enjoy reading it, but I just felt the character development and plot were somewhat \\"light\\" and situations could have been dealt with in a more in depth manner. But it is still a very touching story dealing with life after death.	2004-09-15

The only thing is that it takes forever for the story to get exciting. The first half of the book is slow. But towards the end, when things start to happen, it all happens very quickly.<br /><br />The characters of Ashling, Lisa and Clodagh are all interesting characters. It is interesting reading about what happens in with them and the men in their life.<br /><br />I thought it was a good book. I especially liked the fact that it was set in Ireland. This is a good chick-lit book.	2004-09-11

This is the second book by Hiaasen that I have read and so far it is my favorite.<br /><br />Skinny Dip starts out with a bang when Chaz Perrone tries to murder his wife Joey by tossing her overboard on a cruise. The book gets more humorous as Chaz just keeps digging himself into a<br /><br />deeper hole by covering up the murder and more.<br /><br />And as Joey and Stranahan start playing out their revenge, I just could not stop listening. It just got more and more interesting. I couldn't wait to see how it ended.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. It is easy to see why it has been on the LA Times Bestseller list. It is completely enjoyable and fascinating.	2004-09-11

This is a really hysterical semi-autobiography, semi-fiction(?) of the life of Chuck Barris. Barris tells stories about his life in show business creating such television hits as The Gong Show, The Newlywed Game and the Dating Game.  <br /> <br />The stories of his show-biz life are interesting and humorous. <br />Then there is the part about his secret life as a CIA assassin, getting rid of enemies during the Cold War.  This part of the book is interesting, and it sounds realistic - but who knows ?  Maybe this really did happen back then. Maybe Barris made it all up to entertain the reader even more. <br /> <br />Whichever, this is book is a great glimpse of Hollywood television history. As well as a funny look at what might have been Barris' other job. The story is so believable you can't tell if its truth or fiction. <br />I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in Hollywood history. <br />	2004-09-04

It was published in 1932. The stories are still amazing and interesting. The book almost reads like a collection of short stories about the war. These are stories about young soldiers interacting with townspeople in ways that sometimes seem very unjust. It is a glimpse into a very different world, time period and mind-set. It is amazing to see how harsh the circumstances back in 1917 Russia were. <br /> <br />I normally don't read books about war or politics. But since Boleslavski is a noted acting instructor, I wanted to learn more about his life. I found this book very easy to read and understand. The stories of what happened to him and his fellow comrads during the war are amazing, and still fascinating.	2004-08-19

And I really enjoyed it. This is the first Sue Grafton novel I have listened to or read.<br /><br />I really liked the fact that the story if built on a real unsolved murder mystery. For me that makes the story all the more interesting. And it is wonderful to think that a novel would do a good deed by helping to solve a murder.<br /><br />I totally enjoyed the character of Kinsey. She is an interesting character as she goes about investigating her leads. I enjoyed how she shows concern for the people she interviews about the musrder. And how she shows a caring attitude toward the murder victim. The two grouchy older cops she works with, Dolan and Oliphant make for interesting characters. The humor tidbits added in about all the fast food they eat really add alot to the story. All in all, I find Sue Grafton's characters very true to life.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this novel, and will be reading more of Sue Grafton's writings.	2004-08-19

This is a great book to get if you want to find out what it takes to be a serious actor. The book teaches the basic foundations of acting, for example Concentration and Characterization and more.<br /><br />  It is told in a story type format with the Teacher meeting \\"The Creature\\" and her aunt and other people in her life. The characters in the book talk about the fundementals of what it takes to act. Because it is told in this format, the ideas in the book are very easy to follow.<br /><br />  I did find that the Teacher refering to his student as \\"The Creature\\" was somewhat demeaning. But then you have to consider how long ago this book was written and the time period it was written in. This was probably typical of the period. Even though the actual book was written so long ago, it is a classic for the acting student. And the techniques and methods the Teacher speaks about are things even modern day actors must learn.<br /><br />  If you are interested in the Craft of Acting, this is definately a book you should read.	2004-08-12

Different mailroom employees from different Hollywood & New York Agencies give their stories of what it was like to work in the Mailroom and learn to be an Agent. The book starts with some of the older Agents who began way back when Agencies were first formed. Interesting stories about the stars of the 1950s all the way up to present times.<br /><br />  I really liked the stories of the pranks some of the mailroom employees would play on eachother. And some of the horror stories when they made mistakes on the job are really amazing.<br /><br />  The Mailroom is an interesting and amusing book about the inner workings of the Entertainment Business. The stories of how the mailroom employees make it to the top to become Agents are a real lesson in how the industry works.	2004-08-02

It is told from the author's point of view about his friendship with the aging star. I personally found Scott Berg's unconventional format very refreshing. So many times I have read a biography only to find them filled with dates and boring details. I enjoyed the way Scott Berg brought Hepburn's biography to life. It was interesting to hear his first hand account of how he watched the last phases of Kate's life unfold, as she told him stories of her early life. Instead of reading just another cold biography, we were treated to glipses of Hepburn as a real person, with a real friend who was able to tell her story.<br /><br />If you love to read biographies, this is one of the best ones out there. A great story about one of our greatest stars.	2004-07-23

I listened to the Book-on-tape. To me, the Four Agreements seem very basic. This is probably a good book for a person just starting out on a spiritual path and who needs to start from the beginning.<br /><br />The ideas based on the ancient Toltec wisdom were given in a very clear and easy to understand manner. But there are places in the book where the author talks about Christian theology and ideas and he misquotes the bible. If he is going to compare his theology to a different religion, that he should have studied up and known what he was talking about.<br /><br />The book does give some clear ideas on how to transform your life. The book-on-tape was read by Peter Coyote and was very easy to understand.	2004-07-23

She realized she was the only stable person in Grayers life, and she is looking out for him when she just backs away and doesn't cause trouble for the X's. She also knows her place as the hired help. If she got involved and confronted the X's she will have a difficult time looking for her next job.<br />The book itself is a disturbing look at the upper class and how they live. Mr. X is having an affair, Mrs X is falling apart, and Grayer becomes emotionally attached to the hired help instead of his own family.<br />What started out as a humorous book, ends up being a very sad look at the life of the wealthy in Manhattan.	2003-09-30

I also think it is very interesting to learn about what makes a leader great - how he was raised, etc... I think this is a good book for someone who wants to get a thorough understanding of the complete life of Lyndon Johnson.	2003-01-26

For anyone who enjoys rock and roll, this is a great \\"who done it\\" book. Not only does the author keep you guessing - but he throws humor in along the way. Alot of these characters sound like they walked right out of a night club on the Hollywood strip, or from the pages of Rolling Stone magazine. The frozen lizard part is really funny. I could not put this book down, I had to find out what happened next. I highly recommend it.	2003-01-26

The story of two cousins and their Comic Book empire is very interesting. But the author goes off on many side stories, telling you background information that happened years before. I found myself wishing he would get on with the story in many cases. But once the story is moving again, it is very interesting and heartbreaking.	2002-08-10

Instead, the star is writing about certain instances in her career that deal with her fame and her fans.

Each individual and couple has a different story and the author takes you through each one. You are told how they made the decision that brought them to The Stork Club.

It tells the story of The Girl with A Pearl Earing in Holland in 1660. The best thing about this book is that it was very easy to read. There was just enough information given to give you an idea of life in those times - but the book does not weight you down with historical facts. It keeps you interested by keeping the story moving - you keep wondering how it will end and where the girl will end up. It is a really good story.	2002-08-10

The characters especially stuck me as those I run into all the time, especially both Mirabelle, and her ... friend, Lisa. The novel is told with some light humor - or maybe I didn't find it extremely funny because I am a L.A. person. I loved reading Steve Martin's descriptions of local L.A. spots, such as his descriptions of Beverly Blvd and Western Ave and Silverlake. I did get a chuckle when he mentions that Jeremy reads the entire Bodhi Tree bookstore. (This is an ultra-new age psychic spiritual bookstore in one of the most hip and expensive areas in Hollywood.) It is a very enjoyable, easy and quick read (only 130 pages). If you are into the L.A. scene, or even if you just enjoyed the movie \\"L.A. Story\\", I would definately recommend it to read.	2002-03-02
US	46128922	R323SM99K46OOD	0743224574	87039745	A Beautiful Mind: The Life of Mathematical Genius and Nobel Laureate John Nash	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Outstanding Biography	I was really torn as to how to rate the book. Part of me wanted to give it a three, another part of me wanted to give it a five. That is because the book is both.<br />  There are parts that are very hard to read, especially in the beginning of the book. The author felt it necessary to explain Nash's papers and theories in detail. If you are not a mathematical person like me, it is a very difficult portion of the book to get through. Its like reading a mathematics textbook. I really didn't want to skim over those portions for fear I would miss something, so I plodded through.<br />   But once you are done with that portion of the book, it does become &quot;the fine novel&quot; all the advertisements say it is. The characters are described vividly and clearly. The situtations are interesting. The author does an excellant job in explaining why John Nash was the way he was. Once I got to this part of the book, I could not put it down.<br />  Also, do not expect the movie when you read this book. The movie is a glamorized version of the life of John Nash, with many of the not so pleasant events left out. This book does not leave anything out and goes over both the good and the bad in John Nash's life. It is a very clear and definate biography of the life of a genius.	2002-03-02

I was very surprised the movie stayed true to the book. Of course, there are a few events in the book that did not make it in to the film. I found the book very entertaining and easy to read. I can see why so many children - and adults - are reading the Harry Potter series. Its a fun, easy read with interesting characters and events.	2002-01-28

It is filled with so much useful information on cats. Starting with the history of our pet cats from their wild ancestors, through domestication, breeding and basic care. I found the chapters on feeding and health care very informative. There was even information on alternative health care. I especially enjoyed the tips on giving your cat a bath. In addition, the pictures in this book are gorgeous. Not only are there pictures of pet cats, but also incredible pictures of wildcats. This is a great book for any cat owner.	2002-01-28

This book gives a good over-view for someone who is a new cat owner. There is plenty of information on cat care and training. Also good information on cats living with dogs and children. The big downfall of this book is that it is badly translated from German. And it looses alot in the translation, making it hard to read. Some parts had to be read over, because they did not make sense due to the translation problem. I feel the publisher should have checked this over more carefully, because it makes the book, which has alot of good information, very difficult to read.	2002-01-28

Almost every type of pet health problem is discussed in this book.  Unfortunately, because the book covers both dogs and cats some of the information is brief. This is a good reference book for pet owners. I would recommend this book to people who own both a dog and a cat and need a good overview of pet health. If you have only a dog, or only a cat, you might want to get a health book that is more detailed for your type of animal.	2001-12-29

It was fun to read some behind the scenes facts. There are interesting stoies of putting together the shows, and the casting of her co-stars. Of course, you have to remember that this is Cybill's side of the story. I would love to hear what her co-stars on the shows would have to say about her in return. This book does not come across as complete, there are events in her life Cybill has chosen not to talk about, which made the book alittle less interesting. But if you are fans of any of her TV shows I highly recommend this book for a great behind the scenes peak.	2001-12-29

The simplicity with which the story is told, will help keep the lessons fresh in your mind.<br />I listened to the audiocassette. I took off one star from my rating, because I did not think the production was perfect. I noticed some background noise here and there. Maybe this was taped during a live talk, I don't know. The noise was noticeable but not distracting. Also, I did not feel the reading was very professionaly done. However, it is still a worthwhile tape to listen to and learn from.	2001-01-15
