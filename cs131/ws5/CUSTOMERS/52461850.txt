There wasn't enough local atmosphere or story to hold  my attention.<br />And another thing that's beginning to grate on me after  20yrs of reading mysteries is ALL THE WOMEN ARE ALL flawless KNOCKOUT  PERFECT...blond, blue eyed, boobies &amp; brains and long legs.

(Koko, the first in the series, I didn't like) I enjoyed every minute spent with these two books tho. Just thinking back on them makes  me  happy! Tom Pasmore and his real father were beautiful characters. The  reader below of April 3, 1997 puts it well.  A Fabulous story  that takes  you many places in many times<br />Mystery &amp; Throat = perfection. Koko =    illogical.	1999-06-21

Didn't I tell you? All grief, I said. All loss.&quot;<br />What a depressing book. It's an endless chase/grapple/scrabble for possession of a  carpet(where the fugue/magic world hides). The orig. idea is imaginative  BUT Mr. Barker never takes off with it. He only gives us a fleeting glimpse  of the weaveworld. Not enough to get any feel for it.<br />  The characters  were either too evil or too flaky to care about/feel for.  i.e.: The good  guys get slam dunked repeatedly.  I mean how many times does Cal get  beat/kicked to a bloody pulp by Shadwell etc.? How many stupid narrow  escapes... only to loose in the end? Failure after failure. Suzanna, the  girl who has a power, rarely uses it! What a waste. And word never seems to  get out and around about Shadwells magic jacket lining either.<br />  There  just wasn't anything to get into or anyone to get behind. The only reason I  continued to the end was because it happens to be Sunday and the library is  closed.	1999-06-21

I  can't believe this book was ever PUBLISHED let alone won an award.  <br />Put  succinctly, it's utterly devoid of what constitutes a book.  Empty... :o(	1999-05-26

Zero stars	I do not recommend this installment in the Dark Tower series. There is so little to do with the journey that it can be safely skipped. And in my opinion should be treated as tho it doesn't even exist. It's better not to  taint your mind with this book. Hold out for V.<br />I mean, COME ON!, 500  droning pages on Rolands past romance.Who needs all that past? This is  suppose to be a forward going adventure! If Mr King wanted to massively  backpedal he should of as  J.R.R.Tolkien did with &quot;The  Silmarillion&quot;.<br />The main characters have stagnated. Susannah with her  blacksugar jive talk, Eddie with his past drug bs and pukie mouth. Those  type of outward personas people project of themselves are usually shed(or  at least tempered) after a very short while when no longer in their native  environment. The characters are not evolving/maturing as they  should.<br />Then after all the history we're force fed, of all things,  &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;  How utterly disappointing/insulting/cheap.  Flinch &amp; Ouch ;o(<br />Next suddenly, Marten(Maerlyn the wizard)  becomes R.Flagg(remember him? from The Stand). BUMMER Another cheap shot.  I'd like to why and what for?<br />The Dark Tower is too GRAND a tale and has  come too far to be cheapened by or contaminated with other novels.<br />Oy is  the stories only future/saving grace that I can see from here on out,  unless Mr. King gets off the yellow brick road to Vegas. Oy needs equal  time anyway! Stop taking him for granted and treating him like a dog. He's  my favorite :o)<br /> The first 3 volumes of The Dark Tower are  fabulous/highly recommended!	1999-05-07
US	52461850	R11RAT4FA89S7R	0553579754	600228327	Fear Nothing	Books	5	0	0	N	N	This is one hardback worthy of your personal library.	Mans arrogant/selfish/self-serving USE and ABUSE of others no matter for what reason is wrong!. <br />This is a tale of the consequences. <br />Yes, the surfer lingo occasionally gets irritating, but that's it! Outside of that  Fear Nothing and Seize the Night (the continuation) are  in my humble  opinion, Koontz best story to date.<br />Anyone who is a pet owner will be  intrigued by Orson the dog, the cat, Mungojerrie and will surely feel for  the poor monkeys. The main character having XP (xeroderma pigmentosum) adds  an interesting/limiting twist. The 3 main characters are positive. No  negative waves here. <br />Just plain fun and exciting to read...everything a  good SciFi/Fan/Horror book should be.  I JUST LOVED IT.  If you want to  feel good than read this story.	1999-05-04

There is no real story. I mean you can only read so much about the flora and fauna of the woods. And Trishas endless debate...which way should I go, which way should  I go, up, down, east,west,south,north,straight line etc. Whew! It gave me a  headache, as did Storm of the Century.	1999-05-01
