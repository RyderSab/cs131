At the so-called \\"super-systemic\\" level history making decisions about the EU system are being made. Examples of this kind are the Maastricht or Amsterdam treaties. At the systemic level, the EU institutions (Council, Parliament, Commission, Court of Justice) interact and decide directives. Details of such directives are worked out at the sub-systemic level where the committees of these various institutions are active. <br />The authors also spend some time explaining the basic makeup of these EU institutions. <br />They then concentrate on the most important policy areas. All in all, this book can be recommended both to beginners and further advanced students of European integration.	2002-09-30

There are other more controversial (and thus often more popular) books written on the subject - such as Crystal's &quot;English as a Global Language&quot; and Phillipson's &quot;Linguistic Imperialism&quot;. However, if one is looking for a book that avoids the polemical pitfall of oversimplification, Kachru's work (although 10 years old by now) remains the best buy. <br />The 1992 edition (the first one came out in 1982) contains contributions by (nearly) all the big names in the field such as Joshua Fishman (sociology), Peter Strevens, Larry E. Smith (intelligibility), Peter Lowenberg (testing), Ayo Bamgbose (Nigerian English), Edwin Thumboo (literature) and Cecil Nelson (communicative competence) to name only a few. Of course there are contributions by Kachru as well, most notably perhaps his article on teaching world Englishes which teachers might find highly useful. <br />The multitude of perspectives is the book's biggest advantage; it leaves it to the reader to form his/her own opinion instead of trying to sway him towards a preconceived thesis (as in Crystal's and Phillipson's work). All in all, this book can be recommended to beginners and professionals, students and teachers, in short to everyone who has an interest in World Englishes.	2002-08-03

In their introduction they provide a useful overview of the EU's lobbying system. They argue that the system of interest representation is similar to the way interests interact with Washington. Although business interests dominate in Brussels (63% of all interest groups) non-profit groups do have a chance of exercising influence. <br />As Cram points out in her contribution, the EU institutions themselves have encouraged lobbying and are active actors in the policy process and not just passive providers of a framework. They bring particular interest groups together and create policy networks. An interesting deviation from the usual emphasis on business groups is Young's discussion of consumer interest organisations. Similarly, Webster's analysis of the strategies of environmental groups offers interesting insights. <br />All in all, the book presents an informative and balanced view of the challenges that private interest - both business groups and non-profit associations- face when acting at the EU level.	2002-07-22

This one, at least, can. Particularly interesting is Van Schendelen's introduction which nicely suggests the questions we should ask about the lobbying process: who, why, on whom, where, on what, when and how. <br />While most case studies focus on business (as usual) the most interesting chapters deal with non-profit organisations. Fisher chronicles the campaign to ban the use of animals for cosmetics research while other authors deal with legislation on the rights of pregnant women and the activities of amnesty international. <br />Both case studies and the general introduction (as well as the conclusion) fit together well and provide valuable insights into lobbying in Brussels.	2002-07-22

A separate chapter focuses on organised interests. <br />In part 2 the authors provide a well-structured overview of relevant policy areas. All in all, this book can be recommended as a well written introduction to European (EU) studies.	2002-07-22

Wright's book, by contrast, provides a rare and exciting fusion of two subjects which in British universities are often joined in theory (\\"European studies and modern languages\\") but seldom in practice. Her study challenges the orthodoxy that multilingualism is always a good thing. Especially in the EU, deeper integration cannot be achieved without a lingua franca. Wright shows how the language question impacts on various EU policy areas. This is particularly valuable as scholars in European studies often disregard language. <br />Her views are sometimes provocative but this book will be beneficial to both students of applied linguistics and of European studies.	2002-03-16

Forster is better known as a writer than as a great thinker.<BR>This volume contains most of his nonfiction writings and thus introduces us to a different side of Forster. Some of the pieces, it is true, are on writing, but most relevant for today is probably his political thought. <br />Forster provides us with a window into the world of the nineteen thirties where democracy was perceived as a fragile and precious object in danger of being blown away by the forces of fascism and communism. Still, in \\"What I believe\\" and \\"Three Anti-Nazi broadcasts\\" Forster reaffirms his belief in this form of government. <br />Democracy is important, he argues, because it allows criticism. He argues that \\"parliament is often sneered at because it is a Talking Shop. I believe in it because it is a talking shop. I believe in the Private Member who makes himself a nuisance. He gets snubbed and is told that he is cranky or ill- informed, but he does expose abuses which would otherwise never have been mentioned\\". <br />Forster argues forcefully against hero worship and against the cult of \\"great men\\". Although rooted in a bygone era, much of his thinking retains some relevance today.	2002-03-16

This famous quote from Marx, given right at the beginning of Holborow's book, underpins her examination of the politics of the English language. <br />In her study Holborow casts a critical eye on several important fields of research in sociolinguistics. To begin with, she argues convincingly that the Saussurean distinction between `langue' (the abstract language system) and `parole' (language as it is spoken)  - and the emphasis that was for most of the past century put on the former rather than the latter - has led to a neglect of the social dimension of language use. <br />In  the Chapter entiteled `Money talks: the politics of World English' Holborow sees the global spread of English as being connected to the capitalisation of the world. However, she is both critical of `triumphalist' scholars, who see English as a panacea to the world's ills, and  `alarmists' like Phillipson [1992], whose theory of linguistic imperialism is too static to account for the use of English in post-colonial and global settings. Indeed, Holborrow convincingly argues that English can be used as both instrument of repression and empowerment. <br />Holborow is at her most provocative in her treatment of women's language, an important field in sociolinguistics. She exposes so-called `feminist' studies of language as reinforcing rather than challenging stereotypes about how men and women behave and interact.  Holborrow denies that women have a language distinct from men. It is invalid, she argues, to lump women together regardless of such factors as age, race, education of social class. <br />The last area of Holborow's analysis is the debate surrounding Standard English. This is probably the weakest part of her study, as she only reiterates well-known criticism of archconservative defenders of an imagined `pure' English language. Holborow points out that Standard English is not a neutral tool but that it developed in a rigid class based society. <br />Despite its subtitle this book will not only appeal to Marxists but to all students, (university) teachers and professional linguists who are interested in a challenge to mainstream views on sociolinguistics. Class and class struggle, it is true, are somewhat overemphasised - with the effect of sometimes overly simplifying more complex issues. However, Holborow's success in exposing weaknesses in traditional sociolinguistic theory makes her study a valuable starting point for discussion, essay writing and further research.	2002-03-16

While his previous work revealed many interesting facts about ELT, Pennycook's post-modern ideology leads to disaster in &quot;Critical Applied Linguistics&quot;. Indeed, the book's structure is so postmodern that there is hardly any frame left for reader to cling to. The only overarching structure is Pennycook's construction of the four schools of applied linguistics and this classification is extremely questionable. Often one scholar is taken as representing a whole school. In the case of Widdowson, his argument is misrepresented to suit the construction of &quot;liberal ostricism&quot;. <br />But the basic fallacy of the book is Pennycook's attitude towards research.Pennycook argues that, as objectivity is not possible, there is no need to try to be objective. While it is certainly true that notions such as &quot;objectivity&quot; and &quot;rationalism&quot; are often biased, the answer is not to discharge these notions but to use them while being aware of their problematic nature.	2001-07-11

Jenkins argues convincingly that in an age where English is THE global language it is no longer valid to teach students to conform to the British accent RP. Rather, the model for pronuncation training should be based on international intellibility. Analysing the conversations of non-native speakers Jenkins develops a Lingua Franca Core (LFC) that is, those phonological features which are necessary for international communication. <br />Jenkins starts out by explaining the concept EIL. After that she shortly sums up the arguments against RP. The middle part is a rather technical account of the various features of the LFC. At the end she outlines classroom activities and implications for teacher training courses.<br />This book can be strongly recommended to anyone involved in ELT.	2001-03-25

The most notable feature is the range of texts included: there are texts by philiosophers (Hobbes, Locke...), Politicians (Disrael, Thatcher...) and from debates in parliament as well as Shakespeare, Auden and even Rushdi. Because the authors have NOT only included specialised texts by experts on the constitutions they manage to convey the picture of a living democracy whith all its problems, issues and controversies.

This is a fascinating question connected with the discussion on linguistic relativity. Unfortunately, many works on colour either disregard the issue or build upon Berlin and Kay's classic work. Written in 1969 &quot;Basic Colour Terms&quot; consists of a simple theory: Colour Terms are acquired in a certain order: &quot;primitve&quot; peoples have fewer colour terms than industrial societes. The only problem is, the theory is wrong. Here is why:<br />The colour samples are restrictive because variation in luminosity or reflectance are not included. At the same time, however, the stimulus array is also very complex and the labelling task forces  the informants to make judgements and choices which they rarely encounter in real life.<br />The research is unrealistic. How many Europeans would be willing - and able - to classify 350 (!) colour chips?<br />The colour research of Berlin and Kay (and their followers) is being conducted in &quot;linguistic isolation&quot;; that is, hardly any notice is taken of how colour terms are used by speakers and hearers in every-day interaction. Morphemic, syntactic, semantic (other than naming) or pragmatic issues are not dealt with.<br />With Berlin and Kay's system it is also easy to make the colours fit the thesis.<br />While Berlin and Kay's research has revived interest in the subject much effort has gone into defending a flawed theory. For a more frutiful approach see the section on colour terms in Wierzbicka, Anna (1996) Semantics: Primes and Universals. Oxford: Oxford UP.	2000-09-24

However, the concepts are explained clearly and´without being overly verbose. To say that Widdowson &quot;calls on the reader to define what the subdisciplines of linguistics should be studying&quot; (an Amazon reviewer) is only partially true. In the main text the areas of inquiry are clearly outlined. In the extracts from other books, however, Widdowson shows that different authors draw the boundaries between the various sub-disciplines differently. Of course, this may be difficult to accept for those who demand one irrevocable academic truth.	2000-08-28

Ammon's research suggests  that in some parts of the natural sciences, partiuclarly physics and  mathematics not even German scientists use German as langauge of  publication.<br />In the conclusion, Ammon suggested that German universities  should become bilingual - a somewhat misguided view in my oppinion (ESP  courses should be enough).	2000-07-22

Do we percieve colours differently? However, this book is based on Berlin and Kay's approach. In the lates 60s these two scientists suggested that societies acquire colur terms in a certain order. First, a distinction between black and white is made. Red comes next, then blue or green and so on. However, as research findings came in, Berlin and Kay's model had to be changed continously to accomodate new facts. By now it is so complex that it is hardly a model at all. Furthermore, it might have been the case that the scholar's own views influenced their thesis. <br /> Rather than admit they are mistaken the model was kept and twisted around. Lucy's article at the end of the book clearly shows the fallacy of their approach. All the other articles, however, are based on Berlin and Kay's approach and thus rather worthless.	2000-07-22

While the former has been called an &quot;alarmist&quot; (because of his view that English has been used for imperialistic purposes)  the latter apparently sees no problem what so ever (and has thus been  called &quot;triumphalist&quot;). Crystal seems to suggest that all  linguistic cross-cultural problems could be solved if everyone would learn  English from an early age onwards. He apparently sees nothing wrong if  Asian farmers cannot read the instructions on fertilizer bags because they  are in English. <br />Rather suspiciously, Crystal disregards Phillipson  completely in this book. While there are some good arguments against  Phillipson, Crystal refuses to enter the debate. More generally, it seems  to me that he refuses to deal with the more unpleasant facts of the global  spread of English. Better to continue writing about the happy family of  English speakers! <br />The book is thus rather naive in its evaluation of the  role, status and attitudes connected with the English language.<br />For those  who would like to read a really damning review I can recommend Phillipson's  &quot;Voice in Global English: unheard Chords in Crystal loud and  clear.&quot;  which appeared in Applied Linguistics 20/2: 265-276.	2000-07-13

In contrast to Phillipson's more recent book (1992) Kachru is critical but not overly  influenced by ideology.

As suggested in the title I found &quot;Goodbye to all that&quot; curiously unsatisfying. Maybe this is the case because I read the edited edition which gives the 1929, the 1959 edition and comments by Grave's contemporaries. Again and again these comments correct Graves who freely admited of fictionalizing events so as to make the book more interesting and to get more money out of the whole business. If he wanted to write a fictional account he clearly should not have called the book &quot;an autobiography&quot;! This deeply angered fellow war-writers such as Sassoon, who also accused Graves of overplaying his role in getting Sassoon a medical board. With this background the book looses much of its fascination. Rather contemptible is also Grave's treatment of the colonial troops which shows a good deal of racism.	2000-07-09

Altough Pennycook overplays the  dangers of English a bit he is far less idelogical than Phillipson.

Linguistic Imperialism raises the point (all too  often disregarded) that English Language Teaching  doesn't happen in thin  air, that it is connected with politics and ecconomy. <br />Phillipson argues  that the center (that is the English speaking countries of the West) have  used English to supress the people of the former colonies. This phenomenon  he refers to as &quot;linguistic imperialism&quot;. He deals with 5  tenets,or rather fallacies, which have been used for such imperialistic  purposes; the most important of these fallacies are that English is best  taught monolingually (without using other languages) and that it is best  taught by a native speaker.<br />While Phillipson raises many interesting  points (the fallacies of ELT among them) his overall thesis has to be  rejected on the following grounds (to name but a few):<br />on its in-built  power asymmetry, that is that the devloping countries are seen as being  incapable of independent decisions.<br />that fact that linguistic imperialism  is not falsifiable: there is no scenario where Phillipson would admit that  English DOES fulfill a useful role in a third world country.   <br />Phillipson's left-wing terminology and tone: imperialism itself is a  left-wing term. <br />a country's linguistic ecology is to complex to fit into  Phillipson's neat &quot;black and white&quot; scenario.<br />Phillipon's book  can thus be only a start for a discussion on global English. For further  reading I recommend Kachru's &quot;The Alchemy of English&quot;, Crystals  &quot;English as an International Language&quot; (critical reading  necessary) and Pennycook's &quot;The Cultural Politics of English as an  International Language.&quot;	2000-07-09

So far, this is undeniably the best. Brittain's book really is a testament to future generations about the &quot;Great War&quot;. The content is far too diverse to summarize in a few sentences; let us just say that Brittain managed to capture the spirit of a whole generation.<br />I might add that I think that World War One is the perfect showcase of a futile conflict. Those dealing with world war literature would do well not just to read the literature of one side. For the American reader I can recommend Remarque's &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; or (less known) Kraus' &quot;The last days of mankind.&quot;<br />In fact, many of these authors (and also many of the war poets) voice the sentiment that the real enemy wasn't the soldier in the opposite trench - it was one's own general staff.	2000-07-09

Published ten years after the war ended it was one of the first books to deal with it  and immediately became a best-seller. During the Nazi-era it was regarded  as &quot;polluting the honour of German soldiers&quot; and burned in  public. The content of the book has been discribed by many of the 169  reviewers; suffice it to say that it gives a realistic description of the  lives of those who were 19-21 at the time of the war. In this Remarque  succeeds as well as Vera Britain, who's &quot;Testament of Youth&quot; is  an interesting account from the other side. Remarque's sequel &quot;Der Weg  zur&uuml;ck&quot; is also highly recommended.	2000-07-09
