Early on, several lapses were spotted, mistakes in the timeline, gaps in the plot-points set down by the great Frank Herbert, and several continuity errors. Our Mentats at Chapterhouse have in this report laid out point by point the errors:<BR>In \\"Atreides\\" the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is presented as a fit and trim man who takes pride in his good shape and his muscular tone. The reason for his immense fattness is not through him becoming lazy.<BR>In the great \\"Dune\\" we find evidance of the opposite. In file# 322 the Lady Fenring states while noting the lean tone of Feyd-Rautha \\"Here's one who won't let himself go to fat.\\" In file# 14 he likens a feature on a globe to \\"sweet caramels\\", and on file# 21 he asks for food to be sent for.<BR>In \\"Children of Dune\\" during Alia's fit of possession by the Baron where his voice is spoken through her mouth his voice id described as belonging to \\"a querulous man, an autocratic and sensual man far gone in self-indulgence\\".<BR>We believe that this clearly shows that the Baron was never interested in being fit or cared about being in shape but rather indulged in all known forms of cuisine.<BR>In \\"Atreides\\" Hasimir Fenring habit of going \\"Um-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m\\" is said to be something he has always done much to the dismay of Shaddam IV.<BR>Again this goes against what is stated in \\"Dune\\" file# 322 where we are told that the humming is called a secret language between himself and his Lady.<BR>In \\"Atreides\\" we see the Harkonnen no-globe used by the Bashar Miles Teg in \\"Heretics of Dune\\".<BR>Our Mentats have discovered a glaring error in this: the age of the no-globe itself. In \\"Heretics\\" file# 223 Teg and the Reverend Mother Lucilla wonder about the age of the no-globe and theorize that \\"the Tyrant must have known about this place\\" and must have let the Harkonnens bulid it to drain their wealth.<BR>Teg believes that the Tyrant himself had once been there and mabey had the occupants killed.<BR>Now, Teg finds the ship about 1500 years after the Tyrant, believes that it was built sometime during the Tyrant's 3500+ lifetime AFTER the events in \\"Atreides\\".<BR>At the end of \\"Atreides\\" we find a High Priest of Dur,(an ancient religion), who \\"had by tradition crowned every Emperor since the fall of the thinking machines\\".<BR>In \\"Heretics\\" Teg has no idea what Jafa Muzzafar is talking about when he calls himself the regional commander for the forces of Dur. (file# 389)<BR>Jafa says in file# 392 that his rank of Field Marshal is a revival of the ancient titles in the Dur, tries to explain a frame bush and then understands that there are no such things in Teg's universe and says that they have much to teach each other. <BR>This, we believe, implies that the Dur is a thing that was discovered in the Scattering and not something that was taken out into the Scattering.<BR>We have asked our Mentats for their prime projection as to why such errors happened, their finding is as follows:<BR>This book was written to capitalize on the name of \\"Dune\\" and rake in money from the legion of \\"Dune\\" fans who would be eager to read more of the \\"Dune\\" universe created by the great Frank Herbert. The writters must have believed that these lapses would not have been noticed, but failed to take into account that Mr. Herbert's books have been re-read by fans several times over and ANY lapses would stand out like \\"a man striding across the open bled.\\"	2003-10-18

If a book is more highly regarded in a church that the Bible, it really needs to be studied with a sharp eye. \\"Unconditional Election\\" has to be one of the most twisted spins on Bible truth and totally against what the Bible says. Wouldn't a predestination to Heaven mean that there is a predestination to Hell? How does one figure out that they are meant to go to Hell? If that is the truth and you can never have the chance to go to Heaven why not live it up and do whatever you feel like, rape, murder, use drugs and wallow in sin? Yes, God is not willing that any should perish but He must punish sin. He has given us free will with which we can choose to sin as Adam and Eve did, He does not force His will on us, that would be against His Prefect Nature.<BR>To say that He makes people to only go to Hell is the most twisted thing I have ever read, that makes God a monster, no better that a pagan idol. <BR>We are given a choice, to believe in Jesus Christ and be Saved or to reject His will and life in sin. <BR>The Word of God makes sense, don't complicate it, read it.	2003-01-03

One of the many deeds that Fenelon undertook was to indoctrinate Protestant women who left their faith and joined the Catholic Church. When he was called to the deathbed of a Protestant by a devout Catholic and prays together:<BR>\\"Thou knowest, my Savior, that I desire to live and die in the Truth: forgive me if I was mistaken.\\"<BR>This goes against what the Bible says, if you are Saved you are Saved once and for all, you don't need to worry till the end if you are or not. It seemes to me that he did not trust God at His Promise, he still was worried if he fell out of God's favor.<BR>I have to wonder at this prayer. As a Born-Again Christian I think this prayer is at best riding the fence, at worst a twisting of Bible truth. He also has the habit of making one point and a few \\"letters\\" later says something different,<BR>In Temper your Standards, he writes \\"Learn to be lenient with the less important matters, but maintain your firmness over that which is essential\\".<BR>In Legalism, he says to never exaggerate, speak the truth BUT then he writes,\\"If you lean too much towardbeing exact, you will become legalistic\\". <BR> So.. You should tell the truth but don't overdo it with the truth? Tell the truth but don't tell the truth? I don't see it.<BR>The author clearly cannot make up his mind on any issues.<BR>Then he really misleads people in Work out Your Salvation where he says that \\"you have the privilege to enter more fully into your salvation\\".<BR>You grow in your Christian life, not your salvation. You cannot earn salvation, it is a gift which Christ gave us, we couldn't earn it no matter how hard we try.<BR>I would not recommend this book at all, read the Bible instead.	2002-12-31

Seeing WolfDreamer again was like hearing from a long lost friend, like a message from the past. I found the scene with him and Sunchaser in the future at the ruins of Chaco Canyon to be some of the most powerfull writing they have done so far. The Spirals crying out for WolfDreamer to save them and now knowing what became of Green Ash's(People of the River) son Born of Water was gutwrenching. You can relate to the panic the people must have been feeling watching their world change before their eyes, having mammoths drown themselves and forgetting what some animals looked like must have been unsettling to them. It also dosen't help that their best Dreamer has lost his way to the One and has fallen for a hunted woman.

It did put a small sad level of the inevitability of history in the story that we could have done without, but that is all in the future.<BR>I found it interesting how the author had the characters understand their history as a people with all of the gaps and missing and re-invented parts to make up for the loss of the old knowledge kept by the \\"Blue Faces\\".

Good things come to those who.. have the disfavor of the whale spirits. I cannot get over how much I enjoy this authors work, no mater how many times I read her first series. The descriptions of the trade goods, different foods, hardships of the characters and their simple desires to go on living &quot;feeling the sun.. and hearing the words spoken by the sea&quot; are so compelling that I cannot put this book away easily. My favorate character here is Kukutux, don't try to get away with anything around her, I loved what she did to Waxtal(about time) and his reaction was priceless! The way she handles people to survive, she is a born leader, and got a seal belly of oil out of Hard Rock by playing him perfectly.<BR>The one person who did start to get on my nerves was the Raven, he was billed to us as a shaman with delusions of grandeur but what did he ever do to even get the position as a shaman in tha first place? He is a manipulator, liar, murderer, thief, and is not the least bit respected in his own village and yet he is the shaman? How did that happen? Who would go to him for anything?

The Europeans are afraid of the savages but always seem to understand the language quickly and become somewhat accepted. Almost always one of them will realize the exotic things the savages have and how much they could be worth. A poor follow up from \\"Daughter of the Reef\\".	2002-08-17

Instead of the girl Yanan telling her story we have the boy Kori, son of the shaman Swift from &quot;Reindeer&quot;. A good summer read, well worth it.	2002-08-17

A lackluster book, not as enjoyable as the first four, and a very tired and stale plot.	2002-08-17

The only enemy in this story is nature and hunger. There aren't a whole lot of happy gatherings or cave paintings or flowery \\"too modern\\" dialog or hunts that get enough meat in one shot here. There is a real sense of if this hunt goes badly we will starve to death and her baby will die if she cannot produce milk. This story shows what it was like to live a step away from disaster, how to survive, how good a distant lodge looks when your fighting off freezing to death.	2002-08-08
US	41644384	RTJLHLRB51LIB	0451190955	454640018	Let the Drum Speak	Books	4	3	4	N	N	I really liked this book, but....	It wasen't needed. This is a very good book in it's own right but it didn't add anything to the storyline that was set up in \\"Remembers\\" and \\"Eagle\\". This book seemed superfluous, it continued with the story when it had ended in the House of the Sun with Kwani's death. I didn't want to see more of the story past that. It is the same way in a western when the hero rides of into the sunset. You don't really want to see him come back because he forgot a few things. It was fitting ending.<BR>Don't get me wrong, this is good book in and of itself, but it didn't do anything for the storyline.	2002-07-07

A delightful story of a woman who must face and overcome immense odds to survive. The plot line moves in different ways from other &quot;Woman against the odds&quot; novels so it is a fresh and not predictable. A very good read and a much better choice over Jean Auel's &quot;Shelters of Stone&quot;.	2002-07-07

It took a while to set the plot, and it kinda dragged for a few chapters so I almost put it down, but it picked up in a very intriguing way. I foung Passing Shadow to be one of the most vile <BR>shamans since Navahk(Corridor of Storms by William Sarabande). A very good read with a different feel than a lot of other pre-historic works. Just hang on througt the first 5 or 7 chapters, it does get better.	2002-06-16

Woman of the Mists was a good first book but &quot;Touches&quot; is much better. Mi-sa is a character that really makes you want to pull for her. She has a very rough childhood; bad day to be born, a gift that appears to be a curse, a crazed(an armed) older woman who hates her and a very...well, don't want to give the story away. A very good read and a good take off for the rest of the series. A vivid portral of the ancient swamps of the Everglades.	2002-06-06

The Gears are among my favorate writers, their books are among the best of pre-historic North American fiction. The poem/vision of \\"Wolf\\" has set the stage for the rest of the books(until this one)and has kept us waiting to see where it will lead.<BR>That being said, this book was a wash! It is a complete takeoff from the rest and it is very poorly written. They just about gave away who the killer was while it was being done. I mean really, if you are about to run away with the love of your life to escape from an arranged marriage that your widowed mother has forced you into and you are discovered by the ONE person who could be described as \\"worst of your fears realized\\", WHO could the killer be? <BR>Did they use up all of their ideas for a mystery in \\"Silence\\", with it's plot twist that you could never guess, and \\"Earth\\" that kept you guessing till the end?<BR>This book is not worth your time to read.	2002-05-31

As I read this book, I had to keep checking the cover to see if it was written by the Gears. Flat, one dimensional, characters you couldn't care less about, dull storyline(if you could call it a storyline), and an unimaginative plot. I read their books for the prehistoric, pre-European, storylines, when I finally got to the end of this chore of a book and saw the &quot;white settlers&quot; I was upset. I don't want to see this series morph into a western series.	2002-04-03

It is a fresh story of love and partnership set in ancient France 14,000 years ago. Alin and Mar learn to see eye to eye in their two seperate views of life. A good yarn followed by the just as good \\"The Horsemasters\\", which is set several years later.(the young girl Fali is now the Old One)	2002-02-02
US	41644384	R2BACQAKFG44BS	0812521463	477457064	Aztec	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A masterful take on the end of the Aztec civilization	This is by far one of the best books I have ever read! The saga begins at the end of the main character's life, the entire story is a memoir of sorts. Mixtli tells of the Aztec world as he lived it, a first hand account of the beautiful and gory civilization of &quot;The One World&quot;. From the multi-colored lights and pure white buildings of Tenochtitlan to human sacrifices and alien customs, Dark Cloud saw it all. Some parts were a little too rough to read though, Dark Cloud and Cozcatl for one, Jadestone Doll and Something Delicate for another. This book is not for the timid, it shows the magic and the savagery of that ancient time.	2002-02-02

I travel to New Mexico every year to visit my in-laws and every<BR>year I fall in love again with the land, the people, the history, the turquoise jewlery.... and the stars. And every time I leave I am heartsick of the big sky, beautiful mountains, exotic plants and sweet air. Reading Voice of the Eagle is the only cure for my \\"desert seperation\\". Mrs. Shuler's talented storytelling and compelling characters make this book one of the best in pre-historic fiction. This book is sweeping in its plot of love, duty, and ceremony among the ancient Towas of Cicuye.<BR>I can close my eyes and see again the vast landscapes, the endless blue sky. I love this book!	2002-01-30

It wasen't to be. Native American lesbians!!?? Sexual torture, wife-beating? Ms.Prentiss went from a very good story of Historical Fiction to some strange ideas about Native American life. A big letdown, none of the rest of her books are worth reading, they are all in the same vein as this one.	2001-12-01
