Jacob idolizes his older brother Asher, an artistic rebel, but is scared to death of his tyrannical father.  His mother is so busy trying to escape her life that she has almost no presence in her son's life.  Jacob expresses himself well, especially in his thank you notes for his Bar Mitzvah gifts and his letters to Meagan, the babysitter whose seductive ways leave a lasting impression on Jacob in this funny yet poignant novel.  Probably deserves 3 1/2 stars but Amazon doesn't give that option.	2005-06-17

The Third Secret is driven by the events of the miracle at Fatima, Portugal and a conspiracy in the Catholic Church, if you can imagine such a thing.  The intricacies and politics of the Vatican are examined while the story races along, and coming on the heels of the latest conclave and installation of the new Pope just makes this book even more irresistible.  Fascinating history, meticulously researched (as always by this author) and spellbinding to boot.	2005-06-17

Harry has his badge back and is working with his old partner, Kiz Rider, for the Open-Unsolved Unit, working on cold cases.  First up is a 17 year old murder that was never solved, but DNA evidence has moved the case to the top of the pile.  But nothing is as easy as it first seems, and this case is no different.  I guess I hold Connelly to a higher standard than most because I know how tremendously talented he is, but while this is a very good book and an enjoyable read, it's just not his best.  The book plods along in places, and the writing is clunky at times.  I expect more.	2005-06-17

Her husband's and son's complete indifference push her over the edge and she tumbles backwards and relives her life, starting with her childhood with her domineering, control freak of a mother and her proportionately weak father.  We follow Kate as she makes friends, loses her first boyfriend, gets pregnant, and eventually marries Rodney, a man her mother is wild about.  \\"Rodders\\" comes from a good (read: wealthy) family, and while Kate feels more or less ambivalent about him, she marries him anyway.  After a twenty year loveless, almost sexless marriage in which she learns to despise her husband and his indifference to her while he's totally preoccupied with playing squash and golf and so forth, she learns to stand up on her own two feet.  And that's despite her mother, her husband and her child - you just can't help rooting for this woman who is trying so hard to please everyone else and still find herself.  More than just a warm and funny coming of age story, this well written debut novel is charming, sensitive and thought provoking.  It also has one of my favorite titles this year and a beautiful cover - and sometimes you really can judge a book by its cover.	2005-06-17

I'm always intrigued by books about a different culture, and this one is an in depth look at the Mormons told from the perspective of a woman who feels her whole life has been lived under a cloud, and with good reason.  The author knows her subject; she was raised in a Mormon home in Utah.<br /><br />I loved the opening line of this book:<br /><br />\\"I was six years old the first time I had an inkling God would not always protect me.\\"<br /><br />And I couldn't put it down until I read the last line.<br /><br />Six year old Allison Jensen and her best friend are playing in a field when they hear a gun shot.  The shooter, an older man with a beard, yells at the girls to take off their clothes.  Instead, they take off running, hand in hand.  But when Allison turns to look behind them to see if they are being chased, she falls and is knocked unconscious.  When she awakens, her friend is gone and never is found.  But that is just the tip of the iceberg of Allison's problems.  As she grows older she also has to deal with a religion she doesn't understand and doesn't quite believe in, an abusive father, the deaths of loved ones and a rape, but most devastating of all is the suspected cover up of these tragedies by her family and her church.  It makes for a most heartrending and compelling story that will not be easily forgotten.	2005-04-19

Finder is back with a new thriller that is almost as good as PARANOIA, one of my favorite books last year.  This time out we meet Nick Conover, CEO of a low tech company - an office furniture manufacturer that has been bought out by a behemoth corporation.  Conover is forced into laying off several thousand of his employees, which pretty much affects everyone in this small town and makes him their least favorite resident.  He becomes the victim of harassment - someone is breaking into his house and leaving the cryptic message \\"No Hiding Place\\".  Meanwhile his wife has recently passed away, his house is a mess due to the renovation of his kitchen that she had started, his kids are having adjustment issues and there is something unsavory going on at the corporate level above him.  When someone is found trespassing on the property, Nick feels his family is threatened and reacts.  He calls in the head of security, an old friend, to help him and things just start spiraling out of control from there.  The good guy/killer dichotomy is a fascinating study in an intense story about the good and evil in all of us, and Finder twists a couple of storylines and keeps those pages turning.  Great read.	2005-04-19

Fortunately, she goes by Wollie which is much easier to wrap your eyes around - and so is the statuesque blond bombshell that is the heroine of this second novel by Kozak.  Wollie is a Renaissance woman, L.A. style; a greeting card designer, part time muralist, part time returning college student and one of the stars of a super low budget reality TV show called Biological Clock.  As bad as that sounds, it is a step up from her last part time job of serial dating (in the awesome debut Dating Dead Men).  This time out Wollie's math tutor, who is also a German au pair for a wealthy California family, goes missing and no one seems terribly concerned.  Wollie goes on the hunt for her and stumbles into the middle of a joint FBI/DEA drug investigation.  Luckily, she also meets a rather sexy Fed named Simon and she is gaining ground as the favorite on Biological Clock.  Lots of laughs, a little romance, and a real surprise ending put Kozak firmly in the must be read category, an elite place indeed.  Very well done.	2005-04-19

Howard Kapostash is the most damaged, endearing and memorable character to haunt my dreams in a very long time.  Howard is a Vietnam vet with a brain injury that has left him uncommunicative - he can't speak, he can't write, and reading is very difficult at best.  Yet, as the cards he carries with him explain, he is of normal intelligence.  Howard lives in a house that he has inherited from his parents, and he rents out a few rooms to a couple of house painters and a soup chef who also uses the kitchen for her business.  The four of them live together yet they all live in their own separate worlds.  But when Howard's high school sweetheart has to go into drug rehab, she dumps her nine year old son Ryan on him, claiming she has no one else to take care of the boy.  At first Ryan is uncommunicative too, but slowly he becomes the impetus for all the people living in the house to come together and form a new kind of family.  More importantly, Howard learns that there can be more to a damaged life than he ever dreamed possible.  King has created a legacy with his eloquent, sparse prose and his unforgettable characters.	2005-04-19

The Dead End Job mystery series is set in Fort Lauderdale, and features great stories interspersed with gentle humor.  This one revolves around the murder of a bookstore owner named Page Turner (you gotta love it!)  Our heroine is Helen, who feels the need to stay on the lam from her ex-husband, preferring to keep under his, and the law's, radar.  So she takes jobs that are way beneath her talents and education (a former high powered CPA in her married life) and ends up working for cash in a small, independent bookstore that is owned by a real creep.  When the creep gets killed, Helen can't help but get involved along with the zany cast of characters that populate this series.  Sometimes I just want to read something light, fun and fast, and Viets always comes through.<br />NOTE:  Another reviewer expressed serious disbelief about employers paying their employees under the table.  That is extremely naive...I believe it was 60 Minutes that did a piece on this a few years ago, and as a long time south Florida resident and former New Yorker, I can say unequivocally that it goes on every day and in all sorts of businesses, from mom &amp; pop stores to doctors' offices to pre-schools to law firms to bookstores...	2004-04-20

It is considered a classic now, and is often required reading in South Florida high schools, and elsewhere I suspect, as well as being the book selected for Read Together Palm Beach County and for Read Together, Florida, a statewide reading project in 2004.  Hurston was a member of the Harlem Renaissance movement, but was abhorred by Richard Wright who criticized her severely.  Nonetheless, this book was an alternate pick of the Book of the Month Club when originally published.  A short time later, some very ugly charges were leveled against Hurston; she eventually cleared her name but she never really got over it.  Her books went out of print and she died, penniless, and was buried in an unmarked grave.  Alice Walker found what was presumably Hurston's grave and erected a monument that reads, in addition to her name and dates, &quot;Genius of the South.&quot;<br />Their Eyes Were Watching God has quite a bit of Hurston's life, and more importantly, her beliefs invested in the main character of Janie Crawford.  The novel is framed by Janie's return to Eatonville, the first all black incorporated city in the United States.  Everyone in town is gossiping about her, and Janie tells her story to Pheoby, her best friend, and asks her to tell the townsfolk.  Janie was raised by grandmother, Nanny, a former slave, who marries her off to an older farmer, Logan Killicks, when she's 16.  She's not happy in that marriage and she leaves and marries Joe Starkes, who takes her to the new town of Eatonville.  He becomes mayor there, and builds a store that becomes the center of town life.  Twenty years later he dies, and she hooks up with the love of her life, Tea Cake, who is much younger than she is.  He takes her to the Everglades where they survive the hurricane of 1928 that wiped out the 'Glades, but Tea Cake gets bitten by a rabid dog in the process.  After his death, Janie returns to Eatonville, completing the frame.<br />This is the story of a strong black woman's search for happiness and independence in a time when neither of those things was easily attainable.  It is written in dialect, and is not an easy read.  I listened to the beginning of the book on CD, produced by Recorded Books and read by Michele-Denise Woods, which it made it much easier to read on my own.  It is also available on audiocassette read by Ruby Dee.  Reading it aloud also helps - hearing the dialect makes it much easier to read.

The story was interesting and the main character, Pi, a sixteen year old boy, was wonderful.  But despite the fact that I read and enjoy the goriest murders and such in the thrillers that I love, this book was just too disgusting for me.  I did enjoy the first half - Pi's family owns a zoo in India, and reading about the lifestyle of a child being raised in a zoo was fascinating, as was learning about  all the animals, that was very interesting and informative.  And Pi's search for religious enlightenment was touching and at times, laugh out loud funny.  But the second half of the book is basically a survivor story, and it left me cold. I found myself skimming through pages of detailed information on one animal eating another while still alive, and various methods of staying alive while eating fish eyes and so forth. I just don't enjoy that sort of thing. Yes, the writing is beautiful and descriptive and the story is compelling.  But it's just gross.	2004-04-20

Chloe Larson is a beautiful young law student who suffers a brutal rape at the hands of a sadist who leaves her for dead.  She survives, but is left scarred, both physically and emotionally.  Twelve years later she's evolved into C. J. Townsend, crackerjack prosecutor in Miami who lands the biggest case of her career when a serial killer known as Cupid is caught in her jurisdiction.  Cupid's calling card is that after torturing his victims - all young, beautiful blondes - he claims his trophy, their hearts.  Townsend is determined to get this monster the death penalty and everything seems to be working in her favor, until she meets the defendant and her nightmares become real again.  The court process is fascinating in Hoffman's hands; she is a former Florida assistant state attorney and it shows.  The book could have used better editing; there are some minor errors and some repetitiousness, but nothing major enough to pull me out of the story.  The violence is graphic without being gratuitous, with details of some really heinous crimes, and the ending is superb.  This is one very powerful debut novel.	2004-01-18

Joseph Finder has taken the ordinary-guy-in-extraordinary-circumstances thriller to a new level.  Adam Cassidy is a worker drone, but manages to use his computer skills to one-up his company by throwing an executive style $78,000 party for a retiring dock worker, and sticking them with the bill - or so he thinks.  But he gets caught and much to his surprise, being fired isn't an option.  He is offered a choice - certain jail time, or the chance to infiltrate a competing company and pass along their secrets. Under intensive tutelage, Adam manages to work his way into a position as assistant to the competing CEO, thus avoiding the prison stint.  But his new boss treats him like a son, and he finds himself with a deep moral dilemma - should he pull out, and even scarier, can he?  The tension mounts almost unbearably as Adam is caught in the middle, making Paranoia impossible to put down. The technical stuff is handled masterfully - it's obvious Finder knows what he's talking about,  but he isn't the least bit condescending, and the writing is clear and concise and gives the reader enough information to make the story work without getting bogged down in details, which is a really tough ratio to find.  Perfect pacing, and even more impressively, a perfect ending, should put Finder at the forefront of the thriller genre.	2004-01-14

Lara's sister Joan is being brutalized by her husband, and with Kilkannon's background - his father abused his mother - he can't just sit idly by.  The inevitable tragedy occurs, but it takes Patterson a good fifty pages too long to get there.  The tragedy and its aftermath spur political and legal maneuverings that were so repulsive, yet rang so true, that it literally turned my stomach.  I had to put the book down more than once and just walk away from it to regain some emotional perspective.<br />Patterson has an agenda here, and he is quite clear about it; he delves into tort reform, but primarily this is a treatise on gun control, for which he makes a very sound, exigent argument, although I'm afraid he's preaching to the choir.  NRA members wouldn't touch this book with a ten foot pole, while former President Clinton blurbed it.  The book does bog down in places and occasionally seems repetitive, but all in all Patterson does a brilliant job of explaining the intricacies and treacheries of exactly how our government works, while drawing us in emotionally with a compelling story and three dimensional characters that we can't help but care about.	2003-10-27

Kit lives in an apartment building in modern day NY with her neighbor, the slightly eccentric 70-year-old Aunt Lu, who is always draped in mink.  One afternoon they have tea together, and Aunt Lu proceeds to regale the curious Kit with her life story.  Lu is the Lucia of the title; a beautiful 25 year old Italian-American feminist in 1950, an age where feminism was unheard of and good Italian girls did as they were told.  Lucia is pursued by Dante, who expects her to give up her job as a seamstress in the couture department of the swanky B. Altman's department store as soon as they are married.  But Lucia wants more out of life than being a baker's wife, she has her own ambitions.  Then she falls for John Talbot, a suave uptown businessman who sweeps her off her feet and adorns her in that infamous mink, but things don't work out exactly as Lucia planned. This novel is peopled with wonderful characters and offers a fascinating glimpse into the gentile world of Italian-American Catholic 1950's values and culture that has long since faded away.	2003-10-27

The book is written in three distinct sections that all get neatly tied together with a bow at the end.  The first section deals with Paul McLeod, a recent widower who has left his home in Scotland and is wandering around the Greek isles.  The middle, and longest section, deals with his son, Fenno, a gay bookstore owner in Manhattan.  Fenno's relationships with his family are explored here, as well as his relationship with Mal, his friend/neighbor who is dying of AIDS.  The last section is devoted to Fern, who is so newly impregnated she hasn't had a chance to even tell the father, who is out of town.  Fern is staying with Tony, an ex-lover of Fenno's, and somehow all the characters in the book come together in this relatively short section.  The descriptive writing is beautiful, and the relationships under glass are interesting, but it is a slow moving, forgettable story.	2003-10-19

Molly is a modern Orthodox Jewish woman and a crime sheet reporter for a local Los Angeles rag.  She reports on vandalisms in some of L.A.'s swanky areas that are governed by HARP, the Historical Architectural Restoration and Preservation boards, then sells the L.A. Times an article about the controversy between HARP supporters and foes.  While visiting a HARP neighborhood, Molly meets retired Professor Oscar Linney when he jumps out in front of her car, apparently lost and confused.  By doing some gentle probing, she figures out where he lives and takes the old guy to his daughter's house, where he bangs on the door and yells until the neighbor comes out and explains that his daughter has been missing for several months.  A short time later the Professor is killed, and Molly can't help but wonder if her article contributed to his death.  Meanwhile, she's been dating her former high school heart throb, Orthodox rabbi Zack Abrams, and the relationship deepens here, despite Molly's short skirts and her obsession with the professor's death.  There are lots of suspects in this whodunit and Krich kept me guessing until the very end.  This book should hold strong appeal for Faye Kellerman fans, especially of her early works.

Ruth is a member of the sandwich generation; her oldest son is away at college, but she still has a teenage daughter at home and her mother moves in after she is robbed in the middle of a bridge game in her own home.  Her husband's company is bought out and he loses his job, and her estranged father has a terrible accident and no insurance and moves in, too.  Ruth's way to escape is to use visual imagery; her picture of solitude and bliss is not a mountain retreat or a deserted beach, but a cake.  Yes, Ruth visualizes herself surrounded by walls of cake and is comforted.  And when the going gets tough, Ruth bakes.  Cakes, of course.  Every day.  Sometimes in the middle of the night, when sleep just won't come.  As the family dynamic changes, they all must learn to adapt and adjust, and eat cake.  Recipes included.  Warning: do not read this book while on a diet.<br />Jeanne Ray is one of my favorite authors, her books just touch the heart without being cloy or cutesy.  Her characters are genuine and people you can care about, her stories are simple yet hit home.  She still hasn't topped her first book, Julie and Romeo, which is on my top ten list of favorite books of all time, but this is a very enjoyable read.  Her daughter is pretty talented, too - she's Ann Patchett of Bel Canto fame.	2003-06-11

But she skips school one time too many and gets kicked off the soccer team, gets kicked out of the casino permanently, loses her life savings on a bad bet at the track, and her mother is pregnant with child number eight, the cumulative effect being that Hallie quits school and runs away from home.  Fortunately, she doesn't run far.  She answers an ad for a yard person and goes to work for the town eccentrics; Olivia Stockton, a sixty-something radical feminist who alternates writing sonnets with writing pornography; her husband, the Judge, who is in the last stages of Alzheimer's; her son Bernard, an antique dealer and old movie aficionado with an obsession for cooking gourmet meals with a theme; his lover, Gil, the \\"normal one\\" (although he is a tooth prognosticator); and Rocky, an alcoholic chimpanzee the Stockton's saved from a certain death - he was trained to work with a paraplegic, who died.  Hallie moves into their summerhouse and into their lives, and gets more of an education than she ever would have at school.  This poignant, quirky, unforgettable coming-of-age story is filled with humor, pathos and love. Not to be missed.<br />Note:  This is the first trade paperback original published by the Ballantine Reader's Circle.  It comes with the reading group guide, an interview with the author and an excerpt from the author's next book (which was terrific - a comedic romance between a Scotsman with terminal cancer and a dying nun) all bound in the back. 	2003-05-30

Private Investigator Brian Kane is hired by a star's wife to follow her husband and see if he's cheating, but someone else wants the incriminating pictures and has the gun to prove it.  A starlet is murdered, then another, and the bodies start piling up.  Everyone has a secret, and after Kane's call-girl-girl-friend gets involved, he takes it very personally.  To make things even more interesting, the women find Kane irresistible, and so is this book.  It was fun going back to the time before cell phones and all the high tech gizmos of today's PI's.  The writing was clean and crisp and well suited to the time frame and story.  This is good hard boiled crime fiction.  And check out the sequel, The Deal Killer.	2003-05-30

Terrific new stand-alone thriller from the author of Gone for Good and Tell No One.  Dr. Marc Seidman, an altruistic plastic surgeon, is on his deathbed after being shot.  Despite the odds, he survives but his wife has been murdered and his 6 month old daughter kidnapped.  Seidman is understandably obsessed with getting his daughter back, and thus begins a story of deceptions and betrayals, all told at breakneck speed.  Throw in an ex-girlfriend who is ex-FBI, a best friend/attorney, a red neck with a heart of gold, and a child star all grown up into a homicidal psychopath, and you have one hell of a story.  Coben has once again written an engrossing tale of intrigue that takes the reader on a wild ride with wonderful characters and lots of jolts.  The resolution was a bit weak, but the epilogue provided closure with its neatly wrapped update on all the characters.  I was lucky enough to have jury duty, so I had several uninterrupted hours of reading time - clear the decks for this one and settle in, you won't be able to stop once you've started it.	2003-05-30

Cavanaugh is a protector, one notch up from a bodyguard - a specially trained ex-government agent for hire.  Daniel Prescott has invented a powerful new drug, and everyone from the drug cartels of South America to the U.S. Federal government is after him, and he hires Cavanaugh to protect him.  But Prescott kills Cavanaugh's associates and tries to take Cavanaugh out too, then takes off, and Cavanaugh goes on the hunt for Prescott.  The action is non-stop in this well written and well researched book.  In fact, Morrell suffered a broken collarbone researching one of the weapons used - the knife on the cover of the book.  This is yet another Morrell book that I could not put down - I stayed up until the middle of the night to finish it.	2003-05-30

Molly Blume is a Modern Orthodox divorced crime reporter with a couple of true crime books under her belt.  She has a family that is loving and close, but not too close, and a job that she loves.  When her high school sweetheart Zack Abrams dumped her, she moved on and in fact married, albeit badly.  But Zack comes back to town as the new Rabbi of Molly's ex's synagogue and before you can say Yenta, they are out on a date while Molly wonders if history is going to repeat itself.  Meanwhile, Molly is intrigued by a story of a hit and run that happened in a ritzy area of town during the middle of the night, but what intrigues her most is that the woman was hit while wearing a nightgown.  While she pursues her story, the Rabbi pursues her.  Krich was thoughtful enough to include a page of pronunciations for the Yiddish scattered throughout the book, but some of the explanations inserted into the story were distracting.  Despite that minor grievance, I thoroughly enjoyed this book reminiscent of early Faye Kellerman, and I'm looking forward to the next one in this new series.	2003-05-30

The only clue is the last call she made on her cell phone - to Ethan's ex-wife, Sydney.  The children tell him a fantastic story of being kidnapped and held on an island by people they call the &quot;Keepers,&quot; and thus begins a cross country chase where the line between the good guys and the bad guys keeps jumping.  Plan on sitting put for a while, this one is hard to put down.	2003-05-30

These women share their lives - their marriages, children, politics, and of course their love of reading, over the course of the next thirty-plus years.  The characters are an interesting m&eacute;lange of suburban housewives - Audrey, an independently wealthy woman who doesn't leave home without baring her cleavage; Slip, the politically motivated feminist rebel; Faith, who has a past she'd rather forget; Kari, a slightly older widow who adopts a bi-racial baby; and Merit, the beauty who is married to the beast.  Each chapter is written in the voice of the host (not hostess - Slip feels that feminizing nouns is demeaning to women), which begins each chapter, along with the book they are reading - which ranges from Love Story (they hated it) to The Total Woman (they really hated it - or was that me?) to On the Road (loved it) to A Confederacy of Dunces (thought provoking), along with the reason chosen or food served or highlight of the meeting, bringing a varying perspective to everything going on their lives and a nostalgic (for me) look back on the past few decades.  This is obviously a book aimed at reading groups, yet it doesn't come off as a commercial attempt at such, but rather a creative and fascinating look at the role of women over the last part of the twentieth century - the books are just an added bonus.	2003-05-30

But then it just started getting to be too much; too many details, too many symbols, too many cliffhangers until I found myself exhausted by it all, yet still racing through it just to see how it would be resolved - but it really wasn't worth the race.<br />The curator of the Louvre is found murdered in a locked room, so to speak - and in a macabre start, leaves clues drawn in his own blood, including the name Robert Langdon.  Langdon is a professor from Harvard visiting Paris to give a lecture on religious symbolism, and coincidentally had an appointment with the murder victim, who of course failed to show.  The victim's granddaughter, Sophie Neveu, is a cryptographer with the Paris equivalent of the F.B.I. but the two of them become the chief suspects in the murder.  Their only hope is to solve it themselves, but with the cops hot on their tail they have to stay one step ahead as they race their way through France, then England, in this complex yet ultimately disappointing thriller.	2003-05-30

Williams is the former CEO of Coca-Cola New Zealand, among other companies, and his son was kidnapped.  A prison inmate, in for life on the three strike rule for theft, claimed he had killed the boy and offered to show Williams the grave.  It turned out to be a bogus claim being used as an escape attempt, and Williams was horrified by the implications of the three strike law putting a man in prison for life for a nonviolent crime like robbery.  He turned that story into this fascinating prison epic/legal thriller.  Billy Ray Billings is a cracker from Mobile, Alabama and for the first half of the book we follow his life, starting with reform school and ending with life in prison for stealing small appliances.  But the life sentence never should have been given - it was forced by the way the local cops were handling their cases to make their conviction rate look good.  Enter Harry Brown, lawyer and free lance crime reporter for the local newspaper, who's interest in this case is quite personal.  The rest of the book deals with the legal maneuverings to get those life sentences overturned and have justice prevail.  Williams draws the reader in from the first page and doesn't let go - even after the last page, these characters will stay with you.  	2003-05-30

Andy Carpenter, loveable lawyer (no, that's not an oxymoron,) is back and suffering from a severe case of \\"lawyer's block.\\"  When you've inherited $$$ million dollars, it takes away your incentive to represent any old criminal who walks through the door.  But things change when a cop of questionable ethics is killed.  The same cop, Alex Dorsey, that Andy's lover, PI Laurie Collins, turned in when she was on the police force.  Then a man strolls into Andy's office, confesses, and asks Andy to represent him.  Meanwhile the police have arrested someone else, someone Laurie is sure is innocent.  One suspect after another fizzles out until Laurie becomes the chief suspect.  Circumstantial evidence abounds, and Andy finally has a client he can get behind.  It's personal now and the stakes have never been higher as Andy has to find the real killer and exonerate Laurie.  Somehow the laughs keep coming as tension mounts and the bodies pile up, no easy feat but a sure testament to Rosenfelt's skill.

Bubbles Yablonsky, hairdresser/reporter, is back in a delightful mystery reminiscent of Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series, but with a definite voice of her own.  This time, Bubbles slightly inebriated rendition of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Free Bird\\", air guitar and all, at a bachelorette party, has apparently convinced the bride-to-be to not be a bride.  She doesn't show up for the wedding, Bubbles is blamed and sets off to find her.  Her first stop is at the home the bride shares with her uncle, whose body Bubbles find lying on the bathroom floor.  Not an auspicious beginning, and soon her chase takes her to the Amish country in Pennsylvania, with drug lords, theme park developers and other unsavory sorts crawling out of the hand carved wood work.  Bubbles goes undercover as Sally Hansen, Amish widow, which is no easy task for our bleached blonde, spandex addicted heroine.  In a strange twist of fate, hottie Steve Stilleto likes her new look and their romance heats up a notch as Bubbles gets the story, and her man.  Nicely plotted with lots of laughs, lots of surprises and more recipes for homemade beauty products, including a hangover cure (not that I'd ever need that.)  Treat yourself to a fun read.	2002-07-13

It was with much anticipation (couldn't wait for another Mike Daley story!) tempered by slight trepidation (could he do it again?) that I started reading Incriminating Evidence.  I am happy to report that my fears were completely unfounded.<br />Sheldon Siegel is a master of his craft.<br />I ripped through this book in a few hours, oblivious to all around me.  Murder, betrayal, and kinky sex coupled with intelligent humor kept the pages turning.  Great characters and believable dialogue take the reader deeper and deeper into Mike &amp; Rosie's world, twisting and turning along the way.  There is enough intrigue and courtroom drama to please any fan of the genre.<br />Siegel creates a story that is totally engrossing and enthralling every step of the way!

Hiding Places reached deep inside me to my hiding places, touching me on so many levels.  I loved the dual stories of Daniel growing up feeling isolated by his Jewishness in goyishe suburbia and the Jewishness he  instilled in his sons by taking them on this trip to find the hiding places  of his relatives from the &quot;not sees&quot;.  The author made me feel  his pain and his joy, his fears and his pride.  It was an exhilarating  read, an emotional roller coaster for me.  Daniel's distress for his  children's loss of family after his divorce showed sensitivity that men are  often criticized of lacking.  The writing is so personal the reader can't  help but be drawn into this family, to care about them.  I found myself  laughing and crying, sometimes on the same page!  This book is a treasure  and will resonate within me for some time to come.	2000-07-31
