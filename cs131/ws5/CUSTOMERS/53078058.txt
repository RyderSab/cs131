Ben is an idiot, Hogan is a self-absorbed ninny, Mitch is  an amateur psychologist (sleeping with his patient), and Aaron is an  immature Romeo.  The women aren't much better, especially Jemma, who is so  silly I wanted to throw the book out the window.  Unfortunately, I was on a  plane, so I had to wait for the airport trash can.  Save your money.	2000-08-13

I don't want those things to overshadow the romance.  Sebastian and Juliana spend most of the book thinking about each other or watching each other.  BORING.  As far as the earlier reviewer's concern with the  &quot;boinking&quot; [sic] scenes, whatever.  They were few and only in the  last 75 pages of the book.  I thought the secret and the miracle and the  resolution of seemingly insurmountable problems just a bit pat.  Pass on  this one.	2000-05-09

I tried to read this one on an airplane, and just couldn't get past the first 50 pages.  It was, however, the only book I had with me, so rather than read the in-flight magazine, I  tried again after my peanuts.  Still, I couldn't get past the bad dialogue  and the rather immature characters.  Pass on this one.	1999-09-04

The blurb on the back cover of this book caught my attention and things got only better as I read the book.

The hero is a jerk, the heroine is a fool, and the plot made little, if any, sense.  Many of the scenes were contrived and left me thinking I was reading a romance novel from the 70s.  Beating women, forced sex, you name it, it's here.  I'm looking for a  little more escapist fiction than this novel offers.	1999-07-01

I've been trying to find new authors because most of my favorite authors are now becoming &quot;mainstream,&quot; and I may just add Becnel to my must read list.

I have to agree that the Vanzagara stuff wore thin quite early, although the relationship with the grandmother and the subplot with Swan were more clearly drawn.  I enjoyed  it, but not as much as some other Quicks.  I'm now wondering if Emma's  sister will be the focus in a sequel.	1999-06-12

Frankly, this book was boring.  I couldn't get much more than 1/3 of the way through it.  I don't like books  that deal with made up legends and make the heroine such a priss about  &quot;preserving&quot; some kind of past.  Rubbish.  Read Scandal's Bride  if you want decent treatment of the subject, at least.	1999-06-10

Alas, it plodded along and I was not even given the chance to guess the culprit of the sabotage; like other authors these days (Krentz comes to mind), Martin apparently thinks  we can't figure this stuff out.  But as far as Brandy and Marcus, yawn.  Ho  hum.  Brandy has too much spunk to be the long suffering heroine, and  Marcus has too much dignity to become the jerk he does.  The changes in the  characters are unrealistic, as are the shipboard scenes (Brandy skulking to  the hold with some chicken?  Give me a break).  Read it for an afternoon of  light romance, but it's not a keeper.	1999-06-06

(And maybe you should check the pulse on the Romance Editor who gave this one a sensuality rating of 7.)  This one just didn't do it for  me.  There were no sparks between the main characters, and eventually when  they decided they were in love (as opposed to falling in love), I didn't  care any more.  Yawn.  And what's with all the poorly written sentences in  this one?  I had a hard time getting over the bad grammar; the lack of  romance was the icing on the cake.  Get it from the library like I did.	1999-05-31

The heroine is a sassy orphan named &quot;Henry&quot; who likes to wear pants and boss the folks on the estate.  Unfortunately, it's inherited by William Dunford, who  may be interested in getting a new manager--or not.  This story was  fast-paced and interesting until about the last 50 pages, when a totally  unnecessary &quot;conflict&quot; (I use the word loosely) was introduced  into the plot.  Pretty good, but could have been better.	1999-04-03

I thought the use of the twins (Becky and Reggie) the only aspect of the story I didn't like.  I don't mind when a story shifts point of view from the woman to the man,  but to children is a bit much.  Otherwise, this story was enjoyable,  although not having read Captive, I was a little lost with the secondary  characters.  And I didn't like the author's note about how to deal with her  titles changing in development.  She basically said, &quot;Tough  luck.&quot;	1999-01-02

There was no plot, no characterization, no setting, no nothing--just one sex act after another.  And half of the book was in italics, making it  difficult to determine who was speaking or thinking.  I was terribly  disappointed in this book.	1998-12-03

Then inexplicably (okay, it was explained in the book but not to my satisfaction) our heroine travels to France (from  Montana!), where she remains separated from our hero for about a year.  Obviously, little romance can occur when the people involved are living on  separate continents!  This book was headed for 5 stars, but gets only 3 due  to this plot contrivance (and others that I won't mention because they'll  spoil it).	1998-12-03

I enjoyed this book, first in the Silk series.  The hero and heroine each have their own demons to conquer, but  they find that it's easier with each other.  The villain is perhaps a shade  too villainous...  An excellent read.	1998-11-02

It's only 192 pages and a lot  of that is the ever-lengthening recaps that we Malory fans have to endure  as the family gets bigger.  Since the last installment (Derek and Kelsey's  story), the Malorys have been procreating like mad and are meeting at  Haverston for the holidays.  The plot in this one revolves around the first  Marquis of Haverston and his (gasp!) Gypsy wife.  Of course, it's a  flashback, but not a bad one, although the story is not well-developed.  The story of the first Marquis has its effects on Jason and Molly the Maid,  as well as James and Georgianna, who are in the midst of a totally  unconvincing spat.  I like the Malorys, I really do, but as the family gets  bigger and bigger the repeating of the pertinent facts (presumably for  those who have never picked up a Malory novel) gets more and more tedious.  Read this one because you have to.	1998-10-25

Jasper and Olivia (our hero and heroine) meet and set off sparks,  then are caught up in a confusing and ultimately unsatisfying blackmail  plot (I mean, how easy is it to have the bad guy shouting the answers to  all of the questions before he's even taken out of the picture?).

I thought THAT book was bad, but this one was worse.  Our  heroine is so busy living in the past that she is unable to figure out that  taking our hero on a tour of the bay does not mean she has to spend three  weeks fishing with him.

I'll even admit the unthinkable:  I didn't finish the book.  Around page 210, I found that I was totally disinterested in the characters (which as several people have mentioned is quite a number) and frankly didn't even care if the robbers were brought to justice.  The plot was thin, the characters one-dimensional at best, and the writing ho-hum.  I could have waited longer for an appropriate ending to the Clayborne saga.	1998-08-02

This book fit the bill until the last 50 pages or so, when apparently our author realized she had to end the book.  To say the least, the ending is farcical and almost unbelievable.  Still, the book as a whole was very good, and although the most of the characters were stereotypes, they seemed to fit in this story.  I look forward to her next book!	1998-07-24

The house is practically a character (ergo the title is the address), and I just didn't share the human characters' obsession with it.  Better Sandra Brown novels exist (the Texas series, for starters).	1998-07-13
