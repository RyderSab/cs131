The idea of writing the financial forcasting projections and tables on my own was quite daunting, but following this book I not only understood how to write the plan, but learned a great deal about small business financials in the process. I had use the software in the past and I had not learned a thing. Here, for the first time I actually understood why a good business plan is important, aside from being a tool for getting people to lend you money, as an actual tool to making the business work. I highly recommend this book to anybody that wants to learn a bit more about financial planning before setting out to accomplish their dream. Personally I am very grateful to have found this book, as it made a hard job easy to do. Thanks Mike, your book is a winner.	2005-10-02

Because you know you will be hard pressed to find a better one to follow. However Shirley wrote several books to follow this one, that if even if not as fabulous, are still great...so no need to be too sad: Shirley's adventures continue on.<br /><br />The book is riveting because it describes in such an entertaining a gripping writing style, full of humour and insight, Shirley's exciting adventure of spiritual awakening. It is an autobiographic book of a very small but intense time of Shirley's life, in which, as many who have had an awakening will be able to relate to, life becomes brilliantly alive, full of synchronicities and magic. Shirley is lead from book, to teacher, to channel, to places across the globe as she follows the promtings of spirit that lead her to glimpse and explore realities that break down her previous belief structure about the world. And as she travels and learns, a completely new way of viewing life emerges for her- and a completely new Shirley!<br /><br />Spiritual insights aside, just the way in which this book is written is superb - Shirley has a real gift  for bringing to life her experiences on the page and the book reads as an exilarating adventure novel. I loved it and re-read it occasionally when i want to recapture that feeling.<br /><br />If you like metaphysics and new age writings, this book is quite a gem and well worth reading. You will cerish it, you will love it and probably read it again and again.	2004-08-08

A personal of integrity and insight, a traveler of many paths, Steve has gathered a wealth of knowledge on the way, a knowledge grounded in his own life and experience. His book could not but reflect the immense wealth of his inner knowing. Freeing the Spirit is marvelous work, a map to the subtle world of Spirit and its workings, a journey through the various aspects of growth that allow for us to finally manifest the fullness of our being and truly &quot;free the spirit&quot; and step into our magnificence.<br />The book covers a range of topics and draws from a variety of traditions exploring psychological aspects of the Self, the masculine/feminine polarity, the conscious mind and the belief structures that form our world. It explores tools for inner transformation from both the psychological and the magical world, eventually drawing us into a journey into the unseen, where we are lead to meet with our friends of Spirit and to connect with them in life enhancing ways.<br />Although Steve Nobel is without a doubt a philosopher and an intellectual in his own right (you will find in this book the profound insights of a dedicated seeker), Freeing the Spirit is much more than a collection of ideas. It is a practical manual for life, with an abundance of tools and ancient wisdom made contemporary and easy to apply to the modern life and issues. A compendium of modern and old, of traditional psychology and the sacred arts, Freeing the Spirit is a gem to behold	2003-12-13

There is a complete section in the book that describes all the possible chart to chart planetary aspects and their meanings, that are very useful when analizing the interaction between two pople in relationship. The only thing that is missing here are the aspects from the planets to the angles ( ascendant, midheaven etc)., that is a bit of a shame, as it would really make this little booklet the most thorough synastry reference book yet. As it is , it is still extremely useful and when i was beginning astrology I used it constantly. I think i have now dowloaded it directly into my brain, as i do not seem to use it as much, but i am still referring to it in my mind. One could say i used it so much, i know it by heart. A very useful little booklet indeed.	2003-05-02

If you want to learn this technique and understand it, without loosing in depth, this book is a very good place to start. I really liked it. Lots of case studies to play with, lots of interesting observations on the mathematical nature of the chart, on aspects and even on the application of harmonics to synastry.<br />As a former physicist and mathematician, I love harmonics as this branch of astrology feels very pure and very close to the essence of things...are numeric patterns the underlying language of life? Play with Hamblin's harmonics and find out for yourself ....Excellent mind fun.	2003-02-28

It is a University level text that explores many of the psychological theories and the lives of the men and women that created them, with a focus on the twentieth century and american psychology.<br />Starting with the obvious Freud and Jung, the fathers of psychoanalysis, Engler moves into exploring many of the later development of modern psychology and its personality theories. We find the theories of Fromm, Erikson, Klein as offshoots of psychoanalytic theory as well as very condesed and clear explanations of behaviorism, the cognitive approach, the existential approach and more.<br />What i loved about this book (one of the few books that i have decided to keep rather than resell after class) is that all approaches are so well explained, with a neutral stance, not biased towards one approach or the other. Engler presents all theories with great respect and you can really tell that she honors and loves  all of these very wonderful great thinkers  of our time....and as a result, you end up loving them too! Studying this text was a real pleasure...I would recommend this book to any University thinking about adopting it as well as to people that just want to learn more about western psychology of the twentieth century. A really pleasant text!	2003-02-28

Well, nobody will ever be able to say this of Robert Blaschke's books. Robert is a top rate astrologer and excellent writer, that has trick or two for all of us to learn.His second book on the Sabian Symbols is no exception to the rule, rich with impeccable technique and deep insight , as in all of his work.<br />Blaschke here not only present the meanings of the Sabian Symbols, exploring their origin and application to astrology, but also explains very valuable tecniques on how to apply these to the degrees separating any pair of planets, approaching aspects from a very interesting and unusual angle...something that will wake up and tickle the immagination of more than one bored astrologer. This stuff will really get that Uranian mind going!<br />The book is also full of case histories from Robert's practice , that ground his complex and interesting aspect theory into the reality of true people's lives. Some of these case studies were also born out of a request put out on the internet by Blaschke, that then found himself flooded with more data than his email could handle...Well, Blaschke seems to have handled the data amazingly well- a rare example of a human mind excelling by far our computer silicon friend (it must be that Virgo Rising!) -and the evidence is here in this very advanced book.	2003-02-28

In particular this book looks at compatibility in relationships and the aspects of marriage.<br />What makes this book special and very worth buying is that it is the only book that i know of that has techniques for predicitng or assessing the timing for marriage. Rose Murray delineates very good technique for looking at a person or a couples horoscope and seeing marriage in the stars...and the date of the marriage too! I have tried her techniques and they seem very solid and valuable.<br />Also the book is very good fun, with lots of charts of interesting and quirky people.

As in her also excellent book &quot;The Hades Moon&quot; , where she explores with the depth that only a Plutonian can, the deep nuances of Moon-Pluto aspects, In &quot;The karmic Journey&quot; Judy Hall also manages to produce a profound and precise astrological text enriched by the depth of her esoteric knowledge and intuition.<br />There is little valuable material out there connecting astrology and karma. Much of what is written are general statement about the nodes and little more. I loved this books because written by an extremy psychic woman with an intellect to match.<br />Judy presents a variety of case studies of people of who's karmic history she knows though her work with past lives and draws out commonalities and themes from their charts. She also used astrological data and material from famous people, such as the Kennedys, Marilin Monroe, Lenin, and Martin Luther King. Lots of gripping information about the Nodes, Saturn aspects, Karmic houses, the twelth house as well as more rare observations about the role of the Ascendant, the Moon and Sun aspects, Chiron and aspect patterns in general as indicator of past life karma and the intentions of the Soul at incarnation. The book ends with some really interesting reading about family karma ( parent/child, siblin/sibling) as well as an excellent section on synastry.<br />If you are of a metaphysical bent and are looking for a book that can give you some valuable astrology to illuminate the depper aspects of the Soul and its journey through incarnations from someone that really knows the territory, this book is for you. You will enjoy every minute of this precious text.	2003-02-27

It is of course the work of Stephen Arroyo, from my point of view, the best living humanistic astrologer.<br />Suitable for beginners , it is also a book that more advanced astrololger will enjoy. A part from the usual descriptions of mars and venus placements and general astrological compatibility comments, Arroyo makes a vast number of deep and interesting observations that are much more subtle in nature and that make this book a real gem. For example, he looks in depth at the ability for a person to engage in a relationship at all, from the individual chart. He sees this as the first port of call of the astrologer. Can this individual, with this chart, have the ability for intimacy, committment, sexuality, etc that will allow for a successful relationship to occur?<br />Arroyo looks at the aspects between charts, the elemental compatibility, at the Sun/Moon aspetcts and aspects with the outer planets as well as the nature of transits in synastry. Much of the book is taken from live lectures and there is such a rich exchange of questions and answers that deepen the material as well as bringing it to life with examples from his practice and from the lives of the participants. Excellent fun...<br />One of the things that I really enjoyed was the case study example he examines towards the end of the book. He explains step by step how he approached this case and i learnt so much from this example. I adopted his way of working as part of my relationship astrology and I have been enriched so much by the observation this great living master makes in this book. I just wish i could have been one of those lucky students in the audience!	2003-02-27

In his first two books &quot;Progressions&quot; and &quot;Sabian symbols&quot; he had us spellbound by his impeccable astrological technique and insight. In his latest book, he has us mesmorized with his amazing Virgo rising accuracy and practicality.<br />Here Robert shares generously with his readers all of what has worked for him ( and what has not worked) as he changed from a lucrative career in corporate america to the more risky and adventurous path of becoming a professional astrologer.<br />This book is valuable for many reason. If you have been a self employed person in the healing arts field, you will share with knowing in the realizations, struggles and successes of a fellow traveller on the path. If you are just starting out, you will have hundreds of fabulous tips to take from Mr Blaschke's book and will probably avoid many pitfalls. If you are neither and the profession of the astrologer is not for you, I can assure you you will still delight in reading about Blaschke's journey as a human being in a material world that manages to stay faithful to his calling dispite the road not always being easy.<br />I thoroughly recomend this book , as well as all of other written by this delightful man of keen intellect and spirit!	2003-02-26

Stephen Arroyo is in my opinion the best astrologer of our time. He is able to combine impeccable technique with a deep understanding of the human being and its psyche. His astrology is a reflection of his humanistic orientation and his keen insight. All his books are an incredible worthwhile read for both the beginning and the veteran astrologer.<br />In his Chart Interpretation Handbook, Arroyo gives us a way of looking at the birth chart in terms of the energetic building blocks within it. Unlike more cookbook style texts, he does not provide just a list of planets, signs, houses but teaches the reader how to tune into the chart in a more subtle way. At first this text might seem a bit vague, but it is ultimately a text in which Arroyo shows us his particular way of sensing the subtle nuances of the astrological energies.<br />Arroyo also in this text is a master at showing us how to unravel the themes within the birth chart. I particularly loved his description of the sub-tones of planets that is something that I use to this day in my chart interpretations. Stephen Arroyo is a fantastic astrologer and writer. All his books are marvellous and this one is no exception. I cannot recommend it enough.	2003-02-26

I use this book as my main reference guide for houses for all my consultations and I have found it to be accurate, detailed and very comprehensive.<br />All the planetary placements by house are described here and very well, with a deep psychological profile as well as examples and facts. I love this book because although fairly simple in its structure ( it looks after all just any other astrology cookbook on houses), the psychology and insight are excellent. It is after all the work of the great Howard Sasportas, such an influencial british astrologer. This is the man that worked for so long side by side with Liz Green and , if I remember well, co-founder of the CPA in London. A non ordinary book from an non-ordinary man, I thoughroughly recommend this book, as you will find it such a valuable tool in your astrologiucal work.	2003-02-26

Carla has dedicated much of her life to explore the wanderer phenomenon as well as being of service to them. In this book are years of her observations, extract from channelings from the Ra material, from the Qu'o group, extracts of letters and experiences of other wanderers on a variety of topics: spiritual growth, cosmology, health and  even sex! Carla shares of many personal aspects of her life and of the lives of the other two memebrs of L/L research Don and Jim, with a candour and honesty that makes this book a real treat.<br />To see that someone as evolved as Carla, privilidged to have been the channel for some of the most profound channelled matearial ever, and for her to let us know that she too has struggled with her humaness is a precious gift for us all. I am truly grateful for this book. If you have enjoyed the Ra material you will love this book.	2003-02-26

I found this text to be very dry. It is informative, with lots of statistical/research type details and useful for that purpose. However, I found the text to lack a more human dimension and as a result i found that I had to make quite an effort to read it ( that is unusual for me). I think that, as dependancies on Alcohol, tobacco and other substances is such a widespread phenomenon in our society, that so many people can relate to, as so many families have been touched by the problems of a loved one with addiction problems, I think that it would have been possible to enrich this text with some case studies or stories. These would have brought the text more into reality and given it more feeling. As it is the book reads very much like a dry research paper on the phenomenon and lacks a little Soul. A good book for someone in the field, but not so good for  a student making its first steps within it.	2003-02-26

I have met Mr Braden in person and think he is a fabulous man, that really cares about the earth and with a profound intuitive insight regarding the changes that we are undergoing. The book is a collection of theories and ideas that attempt to bring together what many of us are feeling intuitively  ( &quot;things on earth are changing&quot; and &quot;the past of humanity is not as we thought&quot; ) with some solid evidence and scientific fact. I think Gregg does a very good job at this and provides plenty of food for thought.<br />The science in the text can be definitely improved upon though, as has been pointed out by a few reviewers with a scientific background. As a former physicist i too found that some of the science in the book is approximative. Maybe gregg's science, although better than that of most new agers, is not as good as some of the people for which science is their daily occupation. I too had some slight uncomfortablness at some of the statements within the book, from a scientific prospective. However I would not for this reason throw out the baby with the bath water. Gregg's science might not be fool proof, but his his intuition surely is. I ultimately found this book very valuable. At least it is a movement in the right direction. Science and Spirit will soon be meeting, if humanity is to progress at all. Gregg has definitely put a very positive foot forward in this endevour as well as sharing of his experience and very positive essence in this text. A very worthwhile read.	2003-02-26

In fact when I moved to the USA from England with only my backpack this book was with me. Why? It contains the most profound psychologically and spiritually insightful astrology that you can get your hands on. In fact, this book is almost a shame to read, because once you have read it, you will be hard pushed to find a better astrological text...<br />Arroyo here talks about the chart and particularly about the aspects and transits of Saturn and the outer planets, not with a cookbook approach but with the insight of the very special humanistic alchemy that carachterizes Arroyo's work. Drawing for Jungian concepts, psychology and spirituality Arroyo brings to life the birth chart and its players and weaves meaning into the life experience. And his writing is so beautiful, profound and yet simple, deep but easy to grasp. I love this man, such a jewel of mind and wisdom for us to enjoy...<br />In the book you will also find lots of stuff about the ascendant, transits, progressions, little bits and pieces of information that, even years after , you will refer to and think about and mull over in your mind. This is one of those books with that magical holographic quality, where every time you read it, it expands and you see stuff you had not seen before...<br />If I had to reccommend one book for you not to miss, this would be the one. Buy it. You will treasure it for life!	2003-02-16

The journey of transformation of Richard Alpert into Ram Dass, the psychedelic experiences, the frienship with Timothy Leary and the encounter with the guru had me spellbound.<br />Also, the next part of the book is so original in presentation, a real experiment in writing and art and of communication through the sensory experinece.

The transcriptions are carried out by Jim and the three are always present during all sessions, creating a triangulation of light that allows for RA, a sixth dimensional being, that calles itself a &quot;socialmemory complex&quot;, to come through and speak.<br />RA has choosen this group because of the purity of their intent and makes himself available to them for questions about the Universe, the Creator, the dimensions, Karma, the law of One and any other material that might aid people in understanding universal truths that might be helpful for mankinds evolution.<br />The materail is very esoteric and requires some concentration. However, it is well worth the effort, as it is enlightening, very precise, accurate and informative. The explanations around the shift in dimensions we are about to undergo on the planet, that Ra defines as the harvest, are devoid of hype and sensation. Harvest is a process that all beings and planetary bodies eventually encur, following physical/spiritual law just as eclipses do or the seasons.The science of the harvest ( ascension) is explained in depth here as  is the chakra system and it's role in Soul evolution.<br />Also extremely interesting the explanation of the polarization of entities into Service to Self orintated entities and Service to Others orientated entities and the implications these have in the ascension process and the roles they play within the bigger picture.<br />A really deep read and well worth the effort. I have read all four volumes and I am about to tackle vol 5. I thoroughly recommend it.	2002-07-25

We have all heard that we create our own reality.Many of us know how to create what we want through positive thinking and visualization. But few of us know why and how this process really works. This is the first book where the physical reasons for which that is so are explained. I have had for a while the feeling that one day our physics will encompass the laws of manifestation aside the laws of motion. In this book Serapis, channelled through Tony Stubbs, gives clear explanations of the physics of thought and creation, that make 100% sense. You will never see reality in quite the same way again. I thoroughly recommend it.	2001-04-27

I never read biographies of singers and rock people...just not interested. I picked up this book in my boyfriend's office and just could not put it down! I laughed , I cried and, more than anything else, I missed him terribly once the book ended. His biography is so honest and real, warts and all, that you cannot help liking the guy and feeling as if he's your best friend by the time you get to the last page. I also found fascinating the accounts of the London scene... so many places and people he mentions I have actually met in person. So I was totally absorbed.	2001-04-27

I found this book very fascinating, although at several point I had to stop and think: is this a spiritual book or is it Sci-fi? I would like to clarify that I am accustomed to reading channelled information. I have read many versions of the history of mankind and the almost certainty of extraterrestrial origins of man. I accepet that this is a strong possibility..But I do still carry my skeptic self with me and some of the information in the book about the ancient hystory of our planet seemed quite far fetched and contraddicted many othere books I have read before that resonated much more with me.Some of the things stated here just did not ring true to me, although i found the information describing the supposed civilization of Sirius very interesting.<br />I have written to the author , enquiring about some of the things I felt were most off key and have not received an answer as yet...will let you know!<br />As a read in itself, I found it very enjoyable.	2001-04-27

Books	5	83	84	N	N	Fabulous	This book is a must for anybody on the ascension path.It clearly illustratates all the levels of lightbody encountered wilst raising one's vibration, but the real gems of this book are the many tools that are offered for the lightworker living through this fantatsic and challenging time of fast track evolution. Times are changing rapidly and many are encounetring challenges that are not easily addressed buy the traditional spiritual methods. Arcangel Ariel here addresses many of these new needs. I personally have been extensively using the Triple Grid technique and have been teaching it to others and the results are amazing.  Enjoy.	2000-10-23

The author advocates that the three main astrological progressions types are not three  interchangeably useable techniques, but aspects of the same experience unfolding in different times in the mental, astral and physical planes of manifestation, the physical being the latter in time.From this he states that all the events that can occur in the life span of an 84 year old, have already occurred in the progressions in the first 6 and 1/2 years of life, highlighting an equivalent to Childhood Development Theory in traditional Psychology within the astrological framework. He also writes about triggers that activate progressions into being, reminding astrologers of the work of CEO Carter, retrieving some fundamental laws delineated by this great astrologer. Many other aspects of progressions are covered ( there is an excellent section on retrogradation of progressed planets) and the book , probabily not suited for the beginner, is refreshing in its insight and spark. My feeling is the Blaschke might well be the &quot;Steven Arroyo&quot; of the 21st century, combining impeccable technique with penetrating insight into human nature. I am anxious to read his next book.	2000-10-09

The book is excellent and the author in person is better still. The only human being that I have seen that positively glows. The information presented is controversial because it touches on one of humans basic  unquestioned requirements: Food. But if one reads between the lines , this  is not a book about food at all. It is a highly evolved spiritual text that  explores the infinite possibilities of being a divine being having a human  experience. It is not a book about the rejection of the physical plane but  about the sublimation of it. For who wants to follow the &quot;living on  light&quot; path, there are clear and precise guidelines, that must be  followed as instructed. Three deaths have been reported following this  method and on enquiry it has been noted that in all instances the  guidelines had not been followed. It is a process and not for all and not  to implement over night. Better suited to people that have been on the path  for awhile and already on an &quot;aware&quot; diet.	2000-04-09

I have been working with challenging children for many years now and I am a little disappointed by the book. Although I am sure that the &quot;Indigo Child  &quot; phenomenon exists, as I have witnessed it myself in my classroom, I  found the book very simplistic and not properly supported by hard facts.  Too many comments from people that are deeply into the new age movement  talking about their own children being amzingly special..Don't we all think  that of our own children? As a worker in the field I was looking forward to  something a bit more substancial. Also beware of the &quot;I am an Indigo  Child &quot; syndrome that seems to be developing in some spiritual  circles, with claims of specialness and uniqueness. Aren't we all one?  Isn't that what it is all about?	2000-04-09
