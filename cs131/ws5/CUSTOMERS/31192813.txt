US	31192813	R22GLQO6TVN6NE	0446361887	406276653	Mind of My Mind	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Simply perfect	\\"Mind of My Mind\\" is the story of Mary, a psychic approaching her \\"transition\\" at which point she will find out what abilities she really has.  She was bred for the purpose by a body-changing being named Doro. <br /> <br />While this may sound like just another sci-fi book, it's not.  All the characters are well-drawn, and within the first 100 pages you have eleven developed characters.  Almost everyone acts in a realistic fashion, even given the bizarre circumstances.  At times I even found myself asking why this book hadn't been made into a movie yet.  I could pick out certain high-profile actors who would have been perfect for the parts, and by simply copying the book word-for-word they would have produced an Oscar winner.  Virtually every line of dialogue rings of human emotion that would satisfy any critic, while also giving the masses something enjoyable. <br /> <br />The second half of the book is a bit less drama and more science fiction than the first, but events are taking place that change the rules applying to the psychics, so the rules have to be redrawn for the reader.  The story remains great. <br /> <br />The only problem I have is the POV changes.  The story is told from numerous POVs in 3rd person, but in a scene about Mary it is told from first person.  I found this a little distracting, but it's still a great read.	2005-03-02

The story is camp, but fun camp.  It would be five stars except for one problem. <br /> <br />I understand the need to set up for a sequel, since this is a trilogy, but Dietz was too blatant about it.  He literally inserted an unrelated short-story, thinly disquised as one or two chapters at the end, just to set up for the next book.  All conflict had already been resolved, the problems in this story were unrelated, but he apparently believes this is how you close the book.  Other than that it would have been 5 stars.	2005-02-22

Both of them were incredible.  But then I came here, and found myself forced to write 4-star reviews.  The books were better than many that I've given 5-star reviews to, but they were so ambitious that even a minor flaw cost them a star. <br /> <br />Then came \\"A Storm of Swords.\\"  Plot webs continued to weave, battles were fought, and the story continued to draw me in.  But for quite some time I felt that a new flaw had surfaced for this book: predictability.  Jaime's friendship with Brienne, and Sandor's with Arya, it seemed Martin had lost his ability to surprise.  But then within the last few hundred pages shocks began to reappear (no spoilers here), and I finally get the pleasure of writing a five-star review. <br /> <br />And to address the issue of \\"A Feast for Crows\\" taking too long, I don't care.  I'm glad Martin is taking his time producing another masterpiece, instead of a work of pulp.  Time is one major difference between the original, masterful \\"Dune\\" series, and the new, fun but pulpy, \\"Dune\\" prequels.  If I have to wait fifty years to get AFFC, I will.	2005-02-07

This book went back and forth in my mind between 3 and 4 stars several times.  It does, as the other reviewers pointed out, go into alot of backstory information, but it also attempts to add to that back story.  Unfortunately, Mr. Cox is NOT Len Wiseman or Danny McBride, and many of his attempts to add to the story (for instance, the sniper), just seem dumb.  He did an excellent job with the novelization, and if he had just focused on the story Wiseman and McBride had already given him from the movie this would have been a clear-cut four-star book. <br /> <br />Also, this might have been better done as two books.  I think a great deal more can be said about Lucian.  Mr. Cox was unable to even get to Kraven's betrayal.  I feel he should therefore have simply cut the book off with Lucian's escape, or possibly with him finding his first set of followers, and made the next book about the whole war. <br /> <br />If he had just made it into two books, not having ANY scenes in the modern day, and told us how it's determined when a pure-bred stops aging (been wondering that since the novelization) this would probably have been a five-star book. <br /> <br />Still, Cox didn't completely screw it up, and it remains four-stars.	2004-12-14

The best thing about it, however, is that it's not JUST humorous.

He isn't some number-crunching executive who sits at a desk wondering the best way to make a particular bottom-line longer.  Instead he worries about what the fans WANT.  He understands everything that made the original \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" great, and what's more he didn't turn into a hate monger against the New Series, but instead choose to reach out and embrace it's fanbase as well.  It was a campy joyride, that, much like \\"Star Wars,\\" drew on archetypes that were universal and represented the paragon of humanity. <br /> <br />Beyond simply that, he makes them grow, but within their archetypes.  Apollo goes from simply a hero to a man bordering between the Earthly and the devine.  Adama goes on to join the Lords of Kobol.  Starbuck is still Starbuck.  Tigh takes on new responsibility, and we truly feel for him.  Boomer remains a brave warrior.  And, most importantly ZAC'S BACK!  You have no idea how much it always bugged me that his death didn't tie into the series very well (unless I missed an episode).  What's more, he helps to reveal a great deal of information about the Lords of Kobol. <br /> <br />To be honest if any continuation is made that does not follow this storyline I will be furious.  Hatch is a man who knows how to write a story for the fans, not for the number-crunchers.  I would love to see what he could do if he got to write for the new series.	2004-12-06

This book contains subplots that were vastly important, but that the movie lacked.  Johnny Fontane's struggles were heart-wrenching.  Santino's girlfriend, and the doctor were a perfect diversion.  And the cop turn hit-man was a wonderful look into what must have happened to Luca Brasi.  And this Godfather is not a thinly veiled thug like the one Marlon Brando played.  He's a caring person, who sometimes has to have people killed for what he sees as the greater good.	2004-12-04

This was after being disappointed by \\"The Color of Magic.\\"  I choose, in fact, not to review that book because I felt that I was simply missing the whole point, and wasn't qualified to have an opinion. <br /> <br />However, when I found out Douglas Adam's work was being made into a movie, I decided to try it.  I was quickly enthralled.  It works in many ways \\"The Color of Magic\\" didn't.  For one thing it's one story, not a group of related short-stories about the same characters.  For another reason, things are there for a reason.  It's true the characters are silly, and unrealistic, but they're humorous characters, not humorous plot devices.  All the jokes actally factor in to what's going on, rather than just being there to be funny.  When the missiles were being fired at the Heart of Gold it actually managed to produce both humor, and drama, and the thoughts of the whale and bowl of petunias, since they were a way to resolve the problem, were certainly acceptable. <br /> <br />Overall, I guess it's just that the jokes worked for me, more than \\"The Color of Magic.\\"  I found this book very funny, and am looking forward to the movie.	2004-11-28

I'm not even sure where most of those 180 pages went.  Still, the characters are interesting, the romance works, and everything is well structured and detailed.  It definately has what you want, the problem is you find yourself wanting MORE of it.  I know the first rule of entertainment is \\"Always leave 'em wanting more\\", but this is just too little.  And it takes Ged too long to get their.  Still, this is a book worthy of much praise (although it might have been better presented as a short story).	2004-11-28

To put it simply, this is the story of Arthur in a mythological setting.  All the gods are being killed by the Christian God, and Arthur seeks to create a land in which all of them can live in peace. <br /> <br />The overall feel is done well.  They present Arthur as a great man, but not as invincible.  In fact an unspoken truth goes through the whole book (although it may just be my knowledge of what will happen that made me imagine this), essentially you get the feeling that Arthur is just delaying the inevitable, which he is. <br /> <br />It's certainly an interesting twist to have Merlin be Jupiter, but one thing made the book perfect: the fact that it knows when to be serious, and when to be funny.  Dagonet was hilarious, and Loki gave an interesting twist on what \\"pure evil\\" means, almost to the point where you wanted to argue against him being so, but couldn't see him doing ANYTHING that was less than amusing to himself (even when he helped others).	2004-10-23

I found Ender's psychological stress to be very  realistic, and truly felt for him. <br /> <br />There are only two problems with this book.  First of all, Mr. Card, you fail to distinguish between intellegence and creativity (creative people tend to have higher than average IQs, of about 120, but many geniuses lack creativity, and vice versa), although Ender was obviously both (which does sometimes happen). <br /> <br />The other problem is that the genius strategies are mostly limited by the fact that the author is NOT a genius.  They're not dumb, they're intellegent, but when you have an entire battle school of geniuses at work I believe you'd do better than \\"in space any direction can be up\\". <br /> <br />Beyond that, the book is pure classic.	2004-10-11

Instead I constantly found myself frustrated.  This was apparently a self-publishing job, done by a man whose first language wasn't English, and needs to get involved with a writers group, or hire a book-doctor. <br /> <br />I'll grant Mr. Riverin that he has an amazing imagination (actually I was never completely clear about whether or not he was serious about this \\"Guardians of the Universe\\" thing, but if they really did inspire him, he should ask them to give him the ability to use proper spelling and grammar), but the number of errors in the writing, most of which could have been solved by a simple proof-reading, made the book impossible to enjoy. <br /> <br />Also, Mr. Riverin appeared to be attempted social commentary, by naming numerous characters after famous people, and making references to who they were.  But the commentaries all ran dry after the names (\\"George W. Wood\\", \\"Nicole Teaseman\\", \\"Bill Rates\\"), the president doesn't even have an accent (in fact noone seems capable of using contractions in even the most casual of dialogue). <br /> <br />Plus, not one single character is truly developed.  All the men come across as super heros, while the women are varying degrees of slutty, stupid, and vain. <br /> <br />Also, while this is unimportant in comparison to the other flaws, this book comes over as a bit of an advertisement, because he claims anyone who buys his paintings (in the book their was an auction in which they were going for hundreds of thousands, and at one point even one hundred million dollars) will go to Ghama-2. <br /> <br />The most irritating part is that the premise is so dang good (it's been done, but only once before to my knowledge, in \\"Riverworld\\").  I'm going to have to buy the sequel, and be frustrated by shallow characters, and bad spelling and grammar.	2004-10-03

I feel that it's important that this book be rated by the standard set by the series.  It should therefore be more harshly judged than Terry Pratchet, but not as harshly judged as George RR Martin. <br /> <br />One problem with the book is the characters become dumb as a brick, which was also a problem in \\"Hidden Empire\\", although they seemed somewhat more intellegent in \\"A Forest of Stars\\" (which is currently the best in the series).  But the fact remainst that I have come to care about these characters, and can continue to do so. <br /> <br />In the end all series are judged by: <br /> <br />1.  The author creates likeable characters, situations, and places that can make you suspend disbelief. <br /> <br />and <br /> <br />2.  The author makes them work together, for instance a truly hard-science world like \\"2001\\" wouldn't have people as dumb as these, but this world can hold them properly. <br /> <br />In addition to that KJA made a comment in an interview, which makes me add another standard to this book, at his request: <br /> <br />3.  The author must, unlike Robert Jordan or George RR Martin, get his books in on time, and give us a new one each year. <br /> <br />So far he has succeeded in all three criteria, and I can only find that the book entertains at a 4-star level.	2004-09-08

Still, both books remain very fun space operas.  One major improvement that this book has over it's predicessor is that the characters are finally acting intellegently.  While not brilliant, innovation has changed from something as obvious as kimokazi attacks, to knew methods of mining that might actually take some brain power to come up with (not brilliance, but thought none-the-less).  He also explains why they don't just have compies do the kimokazi attacks (aside from the fact that the human's and Ildirans have less ships, compies aren't capable of military work, which I presume means they aren't capable of sufficient decision making to manuver a ship around the hydrogue fire).<br />I have two main problems with this book, but they aren't enough to cost it a star when judged by it's own standard.  One is the inconsistency with naming at the beggining of the chapters (i.e. Jora'h is &quot;Prime Designate Jora'h&quot; and later &quot;Mage-Imperator Jora'h&quot;, but Udru'h is just &quot;Dobro Designate&quot;, and Cyroc'h is just &quot;Mage-Imperator&quot;).  The other problem are these elemental aliens.  While it has yet to cost the series to much believability, it does seem a bit far fetched that World Tree roots are harder than any metal despite being organic, and hence requiring semi-permeable membranes for their cells, and their should be at least a slight difference in analysis between Wentals and H2O.  I hope KJA thought ahead, or I see &quot;Storms&quot; on the &quot;Horizon&quot; (the next book is &quot;Horizon Storms&quot; which I hope to read soon).	2004-06-15

It's essentially the converse of 1984.  In Orwell's masterpiece (I won't deny either of these books that title) the government has absolute power.  1984 has been called &quot;The end of all Utopias&quot; because the people can't win.<br />In Bradbury's work, however, the government is not all powerful, and still has those who work against it that it foolishly ignores.  Furthermore, the war is not to permanently distract the people, it is a real thing to win or lose.  The people aren't closely monitored, they can even have ideas so long as they don't have books.  In the end this is the beggining of a Utopia, in 451 the government can't win, they will eventually fall and a new age of learning will rise...to fall again, and again, and again, but as Bradbury points out unlike the Phoenix we may eventually learn NOT TO JUMP IN THE FREAKIN' FUNERAL PYRE, OR EVEN TO BUILD IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!	2004-05-30

I can tell this seems to be closely tied in with the Jedi Academy Trilogy (or at least presume, I haven't read that yet), but the connection is mostly in the middle.  It starts and ends with the story about his wife, but there's a big gapping hole where they focus on Exar Kun, and the author seems to loose sight of his main goal (he should have had him leave Yavin before they final showdown with Kun, to keep focus).	2004-05-17

Once again Martin manages to blur the lines of good and evil, most prominently in Tyrion and Varys, but in virtually everyone else too.  There are no truly &quot;good&quot; characters, and the only purely &quot;evil&quot; character is Joffrey.<br />I've said his previous volume was reminescent of &quot;Dune&quot;, in fact the only reason it got four stars instead of five was because the parrallels between Leto and Eddard made Eddard's fate obvious, and the chapters spent developing him seem somewhat redundant (of course the character's whose deaths surprise me are fine).  Anyway, this second volume no longer mirror's &quot;Dune&quot;, but that's fine with me because the whole message of Dune was &quot;YOU FREAKIN' IDIOTIC HUMANS, WHY ARE YOU STANDING AROUND WAITING TO KILL FANATICALLY FOR THE FIRST SO-CALLED MESSIAH THAT COMES ALONG!!!  THINK FOR YOUR SEEEELLLLLVVVEEESSS!!!!&quot; So I won't hold it against Martin that he thinks for himself.<br />From what I've read of the other reviews the most popular character is Tyrion, and his fans get plenty of him in this book.  Unfortunately though, my favorite character, Daenarys, is an underused element who seems to be waiting for a later book to DO something, and that cost Martin one star from me.	2004-04-30

To you nay-sayer Tolkien fanatics who complain about similar names, SHUT UP!  HE'S PAYING HOMAGE TO TOLKIEN, WHO IS BY THE WAY, UNDESERVING OF HOMAGE PAID BY A REAL AUTHOR!  JUST AS HIS WORK WAS UNWORTHY OF PETER JACKSON'S ATTENTION!<br />Now that we have that out of the way I can say that despite the homage to Tolkien, this is a book that, unlike LOTR, is worthy of our time and money (it's also far better than the Hobbit, which was Tolkien's only work worth reading).  The characters are actually interesting, where Tolkien got so bogged down in detail I couldn't even remember who the character's were.  There was even a character that we got attached to before he was born (Rhaego), and when he was still-born it broke our hearts (he was prophesied to be a great war leader, known as &quot;The Stallion who will mount the world&quot;).<br />While the names are Tolkien's, the writing style is in homage to none other than the great Frank Herbert, even some plot events are Herbertish (and from what I've read about future books it will continue that way), although this story is unique.  I would even call this story a grand assault on Fantasy, in an attempt to drive out the Tolky's, and give followers of Frank Herbert control of the Genre.  I think the assault should have taken place after getting Scifi firmly under control (Lucas followers still control it, but I don't hate them, even if they are somewhat dumb their entertaining), but so long as Tolkien get's run out of town.<br />Why then did I not give it a perfect rating.  One reason, to much focus on Eddard.  It's so similar to Dune I knew from the beggining Eddard's fate would be that of Duke Leto, and why do I want to read from the point of someone I can tell already is going to die.

The \\"Hardy Boys\\" feel of the first book unfortunately returns, and while not full blown is enough to pull the book down somewhat.<br />On the up side though some of the mystique of the second book that emulates \\"Dark Shadows\\" is there, standing side by side with the third books more complex immagery.  So in the end were this book made into a movie, while it would have been doable in the 60s, lacking anything that would have looked too cheasy, it would also be possible to be done in the 20th century without adding in two hours of mindless action that didn't occurr in the book, just to make the f/x guys happy (do the cave, the Grey King, and a time travel scene for Gwene and Bran, then send them on to the next movie with a smile and a months paycheck for two weeks).	2004-01-02
US	31192813	R1HMME826SH8QB	0967034612	340934312	Plague at Redhook	Books	3	0	2	N	N	Good start	I was lucky enough to walk into my local Waldenbooks when Mr. Cobb was there doing a books signing.  I'm a big fan of scifi, so, even though I had low expectations for this book (the publisher is so small it has yet to publish a second book), I wanted to encourage more book signings in my area (perhaps by less local authors), so I bought the book and got it signed.<br />I must say that this book was better than I expected.  While  it failed to overwhelm me, it lacked closure, so I think this is intended as the beggining of a series.  All together this is book presents the rough outline of a world that needs to be fleshed out.  It seems to some extent like a bridge between two series that haven't been written.  One about exploring other planets (31 other planets to be precise, before they came across this one), and one about these newly created immortals trapped on Redhook for quite possibly the rest of their unnaturally long lives.<br />I can imagine that those nano-robots would be worth a fotune to any smuggler who can sneak onto the planets surface (given time one of them could reproduce, and make an entire planet immortal) and get some.  I also can't help but think that understanding human anatomy was the first step in....well...improving it.	2003-12-24

All I can say is &quot;Houston, we have a franchise!&quot;, and hopefully a long lasting one too (I could really see this being added to the massive Alien/Predator/Terminator/Robocop crossover franchise).  But, unfortunately, this book didn't live up to the standard.  It was a good synopsis of the movie, but failed to include much extra (the only addition was a scene under a pier that must have been deleted, but I won't spoil that for you).  Overall, if you liked the movie, get the book, if not, don't.	2003-12-21

I grant that this book has little relavence to the main Dune story line, nor is it on par with that storyline's writing, but it's a decent way to kill time.  While a bit underdeveloped, the characters managed to stand out somewhat.  The story, while rushed at times, was good, and while it did jump around, the writing style was o.k.	2003-12-14

This series is horrible beyond all conception. Tolkien overbloats EVERYTHING to the point where it's absolutely ridiculous, and I loose tract of the plot amidst unimportant details. Quite frankly my only thought is I DON'T CARE WHO EVERYONE'S FATHER IS, IF YOU WANT ME TO KNOW THEN WRITE A PREQUEL, JUST TELL THE STORY IT IDIOTIC BRIT! I don't know how someone who wrote something as good as &quot;The Hobbit&quot; could produce this junk. I think what happened was he had a bunch of notes left over, and wanted to cash in by writing a sequel, so he threw all the details he had onto a shallow plot, but sense it was to complicated to be called &quot;dumbed-down&quot; like most money-making sequels noone could attack it. And it was so complicated people have been trying to convince others for decades that they're intellegent because they can understand this book, but since noone understands it, noone can test them to see if they really do or not. Anyway, if you want a complicated plot you can understand, read &quot;Dune&quot; by Frank Herbert.	2003-11-27

It's feel is like that of \\"Dark Shadows\\".  I certainly hope this is never made into a movie, there's absolute nothing in it that would require post-60s special effects technology, and so the director would inevitably make stuff up so he coudl throw in absurd amounts of CGI technology.	2003-11-26

But this book seems more like \\"Hardy Boys\\", with only one instance of any real use of supernatural abilities.	2003-11-26

It eliminates the \\"Hardy Boys\\" feel of the first book, and maintains some of the mystery of the second book.  It also throws in a more in-your-face kind of supernatural force than the \\"Dark Shadows\\" feel of the second book.  If a movie had to be made about one of these books, of the three I've read so far it would need to be this one.  Primarily because the Greenwitch, and Will and Merri's journey into the sea would provide a director with enough CGI images to keep him happy.	2003-11-26

It seemed that like with the Dune prequels, Mr. Anderson had continued to stand on the shoulders of giants without losing his balance, but was afraid to stand up so he could see a bit more than the giants (the giants being Frank Herbert, and George Lucas).  But then at the end the long known revelation came.  And it wasn't what it was (that was evident early on), but the way everyone reached made me feel like I was there.  The sheer emotion got Mr. Anderson the last star, and a perfect review from me.	2003-11-24

It puts Tolkien to shame a hundred times over.  The plots are complicated, but actually MAKE SENSE!!!!!!

While it deals with an interesting world it just doesn't &quot;feel&quot; like fantasy.  For a long time Magic novels have proudly combined fantasy with scifi, but this clearly felt to much like scifi.  In addition he got characteristics of the colors wrong, lacked much character development, and refused to give any sense of politics to it forgetting a long tradition of MTG politics involving many points of view that in this novel have been traded in for just Glissa's.	2003-11-23
