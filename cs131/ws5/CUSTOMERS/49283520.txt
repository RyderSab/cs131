After volume 13 which focused on Jacen's struggle with the Yuuzhan Vong, Vergere and himself, the focus returns to the war at large, which hasn't been going well.  However, there may now be some light.  New Republic forces are learning more and more about not only Vong biotech, but also their culture, and are picking up some weaknesses along the way. <br /> <br />However, the infighting and lack of confidence among the locals have been their greatest weakness.  Politics has been the downfall of the New Republic thus far. <br /> <br />Will Luke and Cal Omas be able to turn the political tide?  Will the work of Ackbar and Jaina produce the tactics needed to win the war?  Will Danni and other scientists produce the advances needed to outgun and disrupt the Vong? <br /> <br />All of these questions are hanging through this volume.  Some questions will be answered, but more than enough is kept lingering for future volumes.  This read is one of the hardest in the series to put down.  Williams does a masterful job of transitioning from one theater of the war to another (including the political and religious theaters of the Republic and Vong respectively) to keep you turning the pages. <br /> <br />The jedi themselves are beginning to come to order, but will that order be on the old lines of the Old Republic of Vergere OR will there be a new Jedi order?  If it is the later, what form will it take?  Read on!	2005-09-28

For the most part, the larger context of the war takes a backseat while we see Jacen wage a personal struggle with himself and Vergere.  The interplay between the two is fascinating and extremely well done.  Kudos to Matthew Stover for making this work within the larger context of the ongoing Vong conquest of the galaxy. <br /> <br />This book gives the most in depth insight yet of the highly alien yet fascinating culture of the Yuuzhan Vong.  The creater of this culture certainly has quite the imagination, and it came out in full force in this volume, the 13th in this saga.  We don't know what is really going on in the general context of the war through this volume, but one gets the feeling that the elapsed time in this volume is relatively short, though it is rather difficult to get a feel for it. <br /> <br />Though I like the political aspects of this ongoing series, this very deep, introspective of Jacen that this volume provides is fascinating.  It brings him full circle from what he was advocating in the beginning the the series regarding a passive use of the Force.  Truly, Jacen has come of age with the conclusion of this volume.	2005-09-20

However, putting political convictions aside, this is a highly entertaining book.  Right off the bat, President Kilcannon has a very important decision to make that has the potential to cast an impact on America for decades to come.  His Republican rivals control the Senate and they have the ability to derail what President Kilcannon attempts to do. <br /> <br />Add to this a controversial court case concerning the right of a fifteen year old to obtain one of the most controversial procedures in contemporary America and you have a book ready to explode out of your hands at any time. <br /> <br />Add to this volatile mix Patterson's skill at storytelling, not to mention his impressive research to make this book as realistic as possible.  At times, he seem to be drawing certain characters as mere charicatures, however, in reality, by the end of the book, you see all of the characters as being being human.  Every one of them, including PResident Kilcannon, with their human failings, but each of them being very human as well. <br /> <br />The end of the book isn't a real big surprise, but how it gets there will surprise many, and that will keep you turning to the next page to see what happens.  Unfortunately, this book has a cogent reality: in the past couple of decades, American political life has become poisonous, keeping good people from wanting to become involved.  Patterson, while keeping his Democratic (and one prominent Republican) the more sympathetic characters, he doesn't point fingers in any one direction. <br /> <br />If you like political dramas with some courtroom action, you will enjoy this.  However, if you are conservative like myself, BUT you can't put the politics down for a good story, you are likely best off going elsewhere.	2005-09-17

In the immortal words of a bunch of Stanford Leftists: \\"Hey, Hey, Ho, Ho!  Western Civ has got to go!\\"  It is interesting that the left continually rails against Western Civilivation and Christianity, yet these are the very societies that have created the unprecedented freedoms to attack them from within.  Something the Left tries to skirt around at all costs. <br /> <br />Now, that is the left?  Flynn defines it very narrowly.  The left isn't all liberals, rather it is the left-wing of the liberal movement.  Flynn is not making the claim that the rank and file of the Democratic party and the liberal/progressive movement is anti-America.  Anyone who has actually read this book would pick up on that rather quickly.  He really is after the fringe that demonstrably hates the United States and what it stands for.  He very helpfully provides specific examples of the anti-America types of which he refers. <br /> <br />The book begins talking about specific instances of anti-American hehavior and statements following 9/11 before exposing the origins of anti-Americanism.  Flynn then talks about the five big lies that liberalism claims America and Western Civilization in general is.  For example,the notion that American women live under patriarchy.  That is flat wrong and most people can see that is wrong without too much thought.  As an American who has traveled in several countries, I have seen real patriarchal societies, and American society isn't it.  Others include the idea that America is racist (if America were so racist, why are Blacks and Asians flocking to America) and the false claim of U.S. as the imperial power.  I won't give it all away.  Get the book.  Flynn then compares Western culture to other cultures that simply can't hold a light to the freedom and tolerance present in Western cultures, including American culture.  Finally, Flynn goes into a discussion of the true meaning and legacy of America. <br /> <br />This is a good read.  There are more than thirty pages of notes (which would be more than thirty pages more than the liberal book I am currently making my way through.)  The work has been meticulously research.  All items in which I myself engaged in a fact check on all panned out.  To me, this work has a high level of credibility, is highly readible, and will restore the pride you truly had in America, but liberal lies had stipped away.	2005-09-15

I, for one, am happy to see more novels taking place in Klingon space.  It gives more of an insight into the evolution of their culture, and the era of \\"The Original Series\\" is a time of epocal change in the philosophical bent of the Empire.  There are those who want to go back to the teachings of Kahless, while at the same time, negotiations are ongoing with the Federation.  However, there has been a nasty little secret that some in the Empire don't want to come to light, while others believe that it is a slight on the empire regardless if it comes to light or not. <br /> <br />This brings one to the essence of the philosophical battle ongoing within the empire.  The novel \\"Kahless\\", which takes place in the era of \\"The Next Generation\\" provides even more insight on this philosophy. <br /> <br />This novel is highly readable even if it lacks imagination at times.  Those familiar with storylines of TOS and the novels will be so accustomed to Kirk playing the hero that his exploits in this novel will surprise no one.  However, what I like about this novel is that it is one that is continually opening up the realm of the Klingon Empire.  While Gene Roddenbery was not happy with the Klingons in his day, I think he would be happy with how they have evolved and developed with the continual expansion of the Star Trek universe.	2005-09-14

Michael Jan Friedman is not my favorite Star Trek writer.  However, despite the fact that this novel does what I HATE Star Trek novels to do, bounce back and forth between the \\"present\\" of Tne Next Generation and the past of the Klingon Empire 1500 years ago, it does offer an insight into the history of the Klingon Empire. <br /> <br />What are Kingons?  What is their legacy?  In \\"In the Name of Honor,\\" which takes place in the time period of \\"The Original Series,\\" we learn of the ideological struggle and change going on within Klingon society.  In that novel, the teachings of Kahless gain a new vigor in Klingon society.  However, decades later, that \\"fundamentalist\\" Kahless teaching comes under assault.  The present-day Picard is off on a mission to determine that is going on within the Klingon Empire.  In this novel, we learn the truth about Kahless.  This novel isn't about fighting, it is about doing what is honorable.  What we don't know at the conclusion of this novel is the eventual long-term impact on Klingon society due to what has been discovered about Kahless's life. <br /> <br />This isn't the best written Star Trek novel, and I really hate bouncing from a past time to the present.  However, if you want to get a look at Klingon culture, this is one of the few novels that afford that opportunity.	2005-09-13

The capital of the New Republic has fallen, the Vong are preparing a massive assault on Borleis and a mysterious force, a Force sensitive power, has been found on Vong-occupied Corescant.  This is the 12th installment of a series that has taken us from the rim to the core, with New Republic defeats all along the way. <br /> <br />Here are the highlights:  Luke is leading a team into the stronghold of the enemy; Wedge is trying to hold on to an impossible situation as assigned to him by a fleeing government; Han and Leia are trying to restore a rebellion-like series of cells and contacts.  <br /> <br />While the writing is not as effective as some previous volumes in that the transitions seem choppy and disjointed at times, there is plenty of background information for those who have read the series all the way through to be able to follow what is going on. <br /> <br />Even with small victories, it seems that there is no hope for the remnants of the New Republic.  In classic Star Wars terms, this is near the end of The Empire Strikes Back in that there is seemingly no hope for the galaxy but to be completely enveloped by this alien vermin. <br /> <br />The storyline itself is engaging, with heroes, battles, and politics, not to mention an intriging variance in the force, and more involvement with a completely alien Vong culture. <br /> <br />I wouldn't recommend reading this book in isolation.  Read the rest of the series.  Otherwise, you will have no clue what is going on in this volume.	2005-09-12

The New Republic is in tatters.  Borleais is held by New Republic forces, but the politicans give orders that would seem to not be in the best interests of the New Republic.  Wedge does a creative job of interpreting orders to preserve his force, and to prepare for what must be done against the enemy in the face of politicians looking to pull a Neville Chamberlain. <br /> <br />The old heroes are together:  Luke, Leia, Han, Wedge, and the younger ones as well.  They are doing all they can to stay alive, and with them, the only hope for the various species of the galaxy. <br /> <br />This first installment of the Borleais theater of the war is well written.  It bounces between the New Republic forces planetside along with Vong forces around Coruscant.  We learn some about the politics of the Vong, the traitor Viqi Shesh, and once again, Luke shows death defying courage. <br /> <br />Long series like this always have the danger of becoming old and boring.

Even worse, after his near death at the hands of Jacen Solo, Warmaster Tsavong Lah declares he will not attack any more New Republic worlds if the New Republic hands over the Jedi. <br /> <br />Some are more than willing to take the Warmaster at his word.  A coolaborationist group known as the Peace Brigade is willing to do everything it can to turn over Jedi.  Even the New Republic Senate is hesitant to fully support the Jedi, even as a traitor is revealing herself among the ranks of the Senate. <br /> <br />Enter Anakin, who comes to the realization that the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4 will be in danger.  His concern for the students in general, and Tahiri in particular, draws him to that moon.  However, the Peace Brigade is also on the trail.  What follows is a test for Anakin and Tahiri as well as for the Jedi as a whole. <br /> <br />With this volume, we continue to get a closer look at the bizarre belief system of the Yuuzhan Vong as well as the maturation of Anakin as he has seemingly recovered from the loss of Chewie at Sernpidal. <br /> <br />While brief, this volume is a compelling continuation of the saga what has brought the Jedi their greatest challenge since Palpatine.

This is the setting that sees the beginning of this volume of this epic series. <br /> <br />This novel goes all over the place.  It traces the exploits of Han Solo, Anakin and his brother and sister, Mara and Luke.  This book gives us an overview of the Jedi and their evolving stance toward the brutal invasion of the Yuuzhan Vong.  We also get even more of an insight into Yuuzhan Vong culture, with an amazing development concerning the heretic shaper by the name of Nen Yim. <br /> <br />This entire series has been more than just a war.  We have seen the explanation of an alien culture with some depth that would not be possible in a shorter series.  We see the development of the Solo children into battle hardened adults, much as we did with Luke Skywalker in the original movies.  We see the politics and appeasement confronting those who would like to take the war to the Yuuzhan Vong.  All of this combines to create a setting that is rich and deep.  This has depth that is uncommon in this genre, and this book is but a small, important part, of the integreted whole.	2005-05-16

No one really wants them, forcing most to live lives that are truly desparate.  In The New Jedi Order, the refugees are being shipped off from place to place, being used, but never being truly welcome. <br /> <br />Enter Duros, a world on the far edge of the Core from the Yuuzhan invasion route.  The surface of the world has been spoiled by centuries of pollution, forcing most of the population of the world to live in great orbital cities.  The refugees have been brought in to clean up the planet's surface. <br /> <br />However, corruption and collaborators are rearing their ugly heads.  A group called the Peace Brigade is cooperating with the Vong.  The Vong have infultrated the government of Duros and many among the Duros elite are more than happy to cooperate with the Vong to hand them the refugees on a platter for an agreement to spare their orbital cities.  Will this deal with the Devil save the Duros or will it doom them to the same fate as Ithor and Sernpidal?

Anyone who has studied modern Southeast Asian history is familiar with the wars of Indochina and the aftermath.  Of course, one of the terrible effects of the Communist victory was the Killing Fields, in which as many as one-third of the population of the once proud and mighty kingdom of Cambodia was killed. <br /> <br />Loung Ung has brought this incredible tragedy home in a way that only someone who survived the madness could.  Her narrative is riviting and is something that can't be put down easily.  As a child, she was forced to leave the city of Phnom Penh by the \\"Angkar\\" (the organization) with her family. <br /> <br />Over the course of the next three years, both of her parents were killed by the Khmer Rouge.  Nearly all of the people of the country were on the verge of starvation, many of whom ended up dying.  This story is both a horrifying reminder of the horrible cruelty we are capable of exacting on one another as well as a powerful tribute to the capacity of the human spirit to overcome even the most desperate and inhumane of situations. <br /> <br />Loung's powerful testimony brings life to this horrible episode in history, putting a face on it.  In many respects, this is akin to the growing genre of \\"Cultural Revolution\\" works.  If you don't know what happened in Cambodia, this work needs to be in your hands.

While the skeptic might say that the series is getting bogged down in minutia, I actually am quite pleased with how this series is addressing the personal nature of the invasion on the various protagenists. <br /> <br />Han is not taking the death of Chewie very well.  Jacen and Anakin continue their philosophical dispute over the nature of the Force and how it should be employed against the Yuuzhan Vong.  Leia is off on another impossible diplomatic mission, this one to try to bring the Hapes Consortium into the war on the side of the New Republic.  The Hutts have been involved as well as dozens of worlds, many of which have been either occupied or destroyed by the extragalactic invaders. <br /> <br />All of this is taking place in the context of a seemingly unstoppable advance that is taking the Yuuzhan Vong ever closer to the Core and the capital world of Coruscant.  The New Republic is grasping at staws trying to determine where the Vong are going to strike next and profiteers are trying to take advantage of the situation to make profit off of the refugee crisis. <br /> <br />The sad part of all of this is that the very human responses (including from many nonhumans) is all too realistic.  From the profiteering to the racism (particularly against the Ryn, but also by some humans at Corellia) is a sad commentary. <br /> <br />The writing is good and I am enjoying the evolution of the story.

Even stranger than this, they seem to exist outside the Force. <br /> <br />Nom Anor has been in the New Republic for quite some time stirring up dissention among the Core Worlds of the Republic.  Yomin Carr has infiltrated an Ex Gal facility at the edge of the Outer Rim that is looking out beyond the rim for extra galactic activity.  His goal is to prevent them from reporting the entry of the advance force to Coruscant. <br /> <br />The old heroes of the Rebellion come to the rescue.  Luke is now Jedi Master, leading a flock of about one hundred Jedi.  However, not everyone sees his vision for the Jedi.  He wants to reinstitute the Jedi Council, but he faces opposition from the government as well as from within the ranks of the Jedi.  Not only is there increasing anti-Jedi prejudice in the New Republic, but also growing anti-human prejudice. <br /> <br />This is the setting as the greatest threat that the New Republic has ever faced comes onto the scene.  This is the beginning of an epic series and this is a great start.  The Yuuzhan Vong are a fascinating race, and they are developed well in the first book.  The political rivalries in the New Republic are interesting and compelling.  Of course, the anti-human sentiments shouldn't be surprising considering the role of humans in the Empire, which still isn't completely eradicated (contrary to the Amazon.com review). <br /> <br />Enjoy this one.

A Senator will take the ultimate risk to try to reach out to the Vong. <br /> <br />Here, the Jedi face the most mysterious challenge ever as the Vong can't be sensed through the force.  Somehow, they exist outside it.  This book doesn't really have a single climax as it is setting up the third book in the series.  However, as you thumb through it, the internal politics of the New Republic begins to clarify as well as history with the Imperial Remnant (useful to those like myself who have not read the books covering the time between the destruction of the second Death Star and the Invasion of the Yuuzhan Vong - a time period of twenty-one years). <br /> <br />The story proceeds logically with a lot of twists and turns that will keep the reader engaged.	2005-04-04

What that list doesn't show is the number of countries that the Soviet Union attacked.  Charen makes reference to the fact that the Liberals look at what they perceive as our sins, but refuse to look at the much greater sins of our Cold War adversaries!  Why?  Charen provides a convincing argument that they actually symphathized with the Communists during the Cold War and actually wanted them to win. <br /> <br />From Viet Nam and Cambodia to El Salvador and Nicaragua, Charen shows how wrong the liberals were on all counts.  Communists in Cambodia will calm down when the U.S. leaves.  That is what the liberals wanted us to believe.  What happened?  As much as one third of the population of the country was slaughtered in THREE YEARS!  The Liberals believed that the Sandanistas were popular in Nicaragua.  What happened when they actually had an election?  Violetta Chamorro, leader of the opposition, won the election, a result that stunned the media elite in the United States.  The media also slandered the family of Elian Gonzalez, not to mention the Cuban American community.  Why do the liberals like every refugee and immigrant EXCEPT the Cubans?  Because they are fleeing the country they look to as a paradise.  Mona provides overwhelming evidence in the form of quotes and actions by mainstream liberal democrat policy makers that they indeed hate America and love the Communists. <br /> <br />The next time you hear a liberal claim that they were as opposed to the Communists during the Cold War as we all were against the Nazis, show them this book and the quotes therein.  This is the history of liberals and leftists.  It is one they should be ashamed of.  Sad thing is that they are not ashamed of it at all.	2005-04-04
US	49283520	R3B5KOQMJ8AMB6	1400054184	925221592	How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must): The World According to Ann Coulter	Books	4	23	44	N	N	Liberals can't take the truth about themselves	Reading several reviews before mine and I am convinced that the liberals who made their reviews didn't actually read the book, but rather, they are spouting off talking points put out by the DNC, Al Franken, and Michael Moore.  However, the reality about this book is that it is both insightful and amusing. <br /> <br />This book is mostly a collection of previous material that has been published in columns over the past few years.  However, there are three entirely new chapters to the book, plus partial chapters of new material.  In addition, some columns that were edited when published before are present in their unadulterated form.  Not to mention a handful of columns that were never printed in the first place. <br /> <br />From the War on Terror to the deportation of Elian Gonzalez and the Battle Flag and Max Cleland, Ann Coulter uses her considerably analytical talents and her scathing wit to hit liberals where it hurts, with the truth.  Liberals need to realize that since they no longer have sole dominance of media outlets today that their lies and deceptions are going to be caught.  Ann does a credible job of exposing the Liberals for the hypocrites that they really are. <br /> <br />One of my favorites is a column published on December 18, 2002 (page 145-147 of the hardbound edition) entitled \\"Democrats:  A Lott of Trouble.\\"  She exposes the hypocrisy of the Democrats and the New York times regarding comments made by former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi toasting the century-old Strom Thurmond.  Of course, the Democrats only tell half of the story about good ole Strom.  What they DON'T tell you is that he was a Democrat when he supported segregation and ran as a DixieCRAT when he ran for president.  When he became a Republican, he was required to renounce segregation, which he did.  Contrary to the lies of the left, the Republican Party is NOT the party of segregation, the Democratic Party was.  The Democratic Party is the party who has a former Klansman and a murderer in its Senatorial ranks, not the Republican Party.  However, the New York Times never mentions THAT!  However, any time a Republican is even perceived (however erroneously) as being a racist, they are merciless. <br /> <br />I also enjoyed the chapter regarding Elian Gonzalez, the only \\"illegal immigrant\\" Democrats ever wanted to deport.  She tells the truth about the legal history of the case, the fact being that there was no court order to deport Elian to Cuba and that it was Janet Reno who sent in a heavily ordered team to abduct him from his family in Miami to deport him to an island prison where his father had no parental rights over the child.  And they have the temerity to complain about John Ashcroft's denial of individual rights! <br /> <br />This is only a small sampling of what is in this book.  Liberals are afraid of debating the merits of the book because they know that they would lose.  Consequently, they attack Ann herself, once again proving this side enjoys playing the \\"Politics of Personal Destruction\\" I would like to have seen more new material.  As much as I enjoyed this, I docked it a star because less than half was new material, though I would have given it four and a half stars if I could have.  I enjoyed reading this.   <br />	2005-03-29

This was the first book by John Grisham I have ever read.  I will surely be reading more of his courtroom thrillers in the future. <br /> <br />The setting if the Gulf Coast where the widow of a man who died after decades of smoking was suing a tobacco company for the death of her husband.  A man named Fitch has worked behind the scenes to win trials in the past for the tobacco companies, but this time around, he has opponents in the game that are even better than him. <br /> <br />Their names are Marlee and Nicholas, or are they?  That is what you are left wondering through the entire story.  Nicholas gets onto the jury and he takes over nearly from the beginning.  The way that he gets into the good graces of the jury is effective.  As the novel proceeds, the plot hatched by the two comes to light, but you are left wondering that their angle is.  It isn't until the end that the angle is discovered, but it is too late for Fitch.  He was beaten at his own dishonest, corrupt game. <br /> <br />This was wonderfully written and had be on the proverbial edge of my seat the entire time.  After reading the book, I don't want to see the movie because I know deep down, I will be disappointed.	2005-03-25

That is the question that Dick answers at the end of the book, and it is a good one. <br /> <br />Dick Morris knows about the political life of the Clinton's more than any man (or woman) alive, having been employed Bill's advisor for much of the past 25 years.  He point by point goes through Hillary's history and assess both her assets and the things that sould give anyone to think twice before voting for her as President. <br /> <br />As evidence by prior \\"reviews\\", there are dye-in-the-wool Democrats who will go apoplectic any time they see someone say anything the slightest bit critical of a Democrat.  However, if you truly look at this book, this is not a 100% \\"hack-job\\" by a partisan Republican.  He heaps a considerable amount of criticism on Republicans in this book.  However, Hillary has a history that is disturbing.  Of course, any attempt at showing balance (either in the book world or cable news) is automatically attacked as right-wing.  This is assuredly a sympton of decades of media dominance (but that is a topic addressed in other books.) <br /> <br />Anyone who is considering voting for her in 2008 (I will vote absentee and I will NOT vote for Hillary) MUST read this book first.  If you don't and vote for her, all I can say is that if she wins, you may well come to regret it within four years.	2005-03-10

Our Debt to the Catholic Church	Books	5	47	53	N	N	The truth about Catholics and the Bible	As a child growing up in New Hampshire, a state with a large Catholic population, attacks against Catholics were few and far between.  I never had to deal with them.  However, once I moved to Georgia, I had to deal with constant falsehoods said about the True Church of Chirst Himself from Protestants who neither know what the complete Bible is, nor can they trace their faiths to the time of Christ.  The Catholic Church can claim this. <br /> <br />A common Protestant falsehood is that the Catholic Church has long hated the Bible.  If the Catholics hated the Bible so much, why would she have put it together in the first place (Council of Carthage in 397), protect and nurture it through very dangerous times in the history of Europe.   <br /> <br />Monks spent incalculable hours in copying the scriptures (movable type printing wasn't invented until the 15th century and Chinese block printing was unknown in Europe).  Does this sound the Church who hates the Scriptures? <br /> <br />Protestants have cut apart and altered the Scriptures since the 16th century while the Catholic Church has maintained the Scriptures in their beautiful entirety for more than 1600 years.  Does that sound like a Church who hates the Scriptures? <br /> <br />The Protestants believe in a doctrine known as sola scriptura (only from the Bible).  However, they can't answer several vital questions including, \\"How can you trust a Bible that has been altered by people who wanted to make it conform to their own personal belief system?\\"  \\"What about the people who were alive and believers before the canon was finalized in 397?\\"  That is nearly 400 years of Christian history without a settled canon!  They argue that salvation is based on faith in the scriptures, but th scriptures weren't finalized until the end of the 4th century, and were altered by Lutheran reformers in the 16th century.  How can they justify this?  In my experience, they can't. <br /> <br />If you are a Catholic who gets some of the Protestant comments that are typical of those who don't understand the glory and history of the Catholic Church, this is a must read. <br /> <br />I also enjoyed Graham's conversion story that is also reprinted in this volume.  His story is a wonderful testamony of the glory of God's work and the allure of the true Church that God has set on earth.	2005-03-10

To his credit, Patterson doesn't hide his bias as he discusses them in the \\"Afterward and Achnowledges\\" section.  He consulted with political experts (both Republicans and Democrats), gun specialists, even a Catholic priest to try to bring an informed realism to the story.  At this, he succeeds mightily.<br /><br />The issue revolves around guns and the links between the gun industry and the NRA-like Sons of the Second Amendment.  While the author is more sympathetic toward the Democratic side of the equation, I did detect some lack of approval of some aspects of their tactics and methods, though clearly not as much as the Republicans.<br /><br />In a sense, this is realistic in that it shows events as they are happening, generally, though not always, from the Democratic president's point of view and not in isolation of other things going on.  I enjoyed the introduction of the characters.  While people who read his other books would be familiar with the principle characters, I was not as this was my first book in this storyline.  However, I don't believe that detracted from my enjoyment of the story.<br /><br />The ending was not all that realistic as the timing involved rarely happens in real life.  However, having said that, this IS a work of fiction and we shouldn't expect the whole thing to be realistic.<br /><br />I will definately search out the two volumes that come before this and I certainly hope that this isn't, as he implied in the \\"Afterward and Acknowledgements\\", the last volume in this series.	2005-03-08

As I mentioned in my review of a Cambridge History of the same region, ignorance of this region is simply not wise, and I would dare say not an option.  In this day of terrorism and other geopolitical concerns, we remain ignorant of this region at our peril.  This book will give the reader a good basic explanation of the ten countries (at the time this book was published) that make up this region. <br /> <br />This work is divided into five parts.  The first part is entitled \\"The Eighteenth-Century World.\\"  In it, the authors describe the various forces affecting peasants, tribal peoples, village-life, etc. over the region as a whole before focusing on specific countries (many of which were colonies at the time.) <br /> <br />Part two, entitled \\"New Challenges to Old Authority\\" goes country/region by country/region and talks about the major changes coming to the region, much of which is brought by the European powers and the expansion of the role that they have had there for more than 200 years by that point.  The section covers from 1750 to 1875. <br /> <br />Part three is entitled \\"Framework for Nations.\\"  This shortest section of the books looks at various forces, such as economic transformation, that are affecting the entire region. <br /> <br />Part four, \\"Social Change and the Emergence of Nationalism\\" basically covers the first few decades of the twentieth century prior to World War II.  Effects of the newer, more direct, forms of colonial systems are discussed as well as the emergence of nationalism, first in the Philippines, throughout the region. <br /> <br />Part five contains an examination of the post-war history of the region, focusing on the themes of independence and social change. <br /> <br />This is a heavy work and dense at times, but that is to a point unavoidable due to the subject matter at hand.  However, this is a must-have volume for anyone wishing to become familiar with the modern history as well as the peoples thatmake up one of the world's least discussed, but most vital regions.	2005-03-08

It is about time that people are waking up to the distortions and outright lies of Michael Moore.  This book is a collection of essays that pick apart and tell the truth of Michael Moore's career, from his one day working for GM, to his incident at Borders (which he later distorts), multiple accusations of censorship, among others.  The authors, along with other contributors, pick his books, movies and statements made at public appearances with the facts.  After checking a handful of their sources, I have become convinced not only of the veracity of their arguments, but that they are also using facts. <br /> <br />Michael Moore has gone too long getting away with film splicing and altering timelines.  In fact, Moore's timelines are more distorted than that Star Trek episodes in which time travel screws up all of the timelines.   <br /> <br />A sampling of the offenses: <br /> <br />Roger and Me:  Altered timelines to give the impression that the City government was responding to GM layoffs rather than the FACT that the actions of the City government PRECEEDED the layoffs. <br /> <br />Stupid White Men:  Distortion of American literacy figures to give the false impression that Americans are less literate than the citizens of other Western countries. <br /> <br />Bowling For Columbine:  Create the impression that Charlton Heston had a history of giving deliberately holding pro-gun rallies in locations shortly following gun-related tragedies.  Reality:  The NRA conference in Colorado was scaled-back and its cancellation at short notice would have been a violation of the law.  The speech in Michigan mentioned in the movie took place EIGHT MONTHS after the murder referenced, and occurred shortly prior to an election. <br /> <br />Also claimed that the NRA was a racist organization from its very foundation by affiliation with the KKK when in reality it was founded by Union veterans in the State of New York in 1871. <br /> <br />On the speaking tour:  Issuing a legal threat to a person with a camera using precisely the same techniques that Michael Moore is famous for beginning from the movie Roger & Me. <br /> <br />As I said, this is only a sampling.  If you want the complete list, get the book and then check the sources.  Unlike Michael Moore's, they are accurate and don't suffer the distortion problems sufferred by the king of the latest film genre, the \\"docuganda\\" (documentary/propaganda).	2005-02-22

You do so at your peril.  China has a long history of aggression and threatening its neighbors.  Today, it has a greater capacity to wreck havok than it has at any point in its Communist history, and we to a large extent have Clinton to blame for it.  There is plenty of evidence provided from reputable sources regarding the manner in which the Chinese government infultrated the Clinton Administration, as well as the ever present threat that China presents not only to the United States, but also its Asian neighbors like Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and most of all Taiwan. <br /> <br />Works like this are ignored at our peril.  For a long time, people have seemed to believe the in best possibility for Communist China, always to have been shown for ignorance in the end.  Those who adulate over China today run the same risk.  Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it.  Unfortunately, there are too many people who have a lack of knowledge of China's history to know the true nature of the threat.  This book will go some of the way to alleviating that ignorance.	2005-02-21

Vir Cotto, Emperor!  Of course, Babylon V fans knew that Vir would become Emperor after Londo.  We also knew that G'Kar would kill Londo and that the capital city of Centauri Prime would be in flames.  We also knew that Sheridan would be in time limbo.  However, this book, which covers the years 2274-2278 tells us how we got to that point. <br /> <br />The Centauri, under the malevolent guidence of the Drakh, have been building their war machine and are just about ready to strike.  Vir has been leading an underground that has cause minor irritation to the plans of Durla, and ultimately, the Drakh, but it didn't put an end to them.  That is until Durla was at the final moment of triumph when the underground attacked Durla in his position of strength. <br /> <br />However, getting there, what was the trick.  Along the way, there was intrigue, betrayal, and love both won and lost.  This was a wonderful storyline, completely consistant with what we already knew about the Babylon V timeline.  In fact, this novel fills in a lot of holes that were left in the series, especially considering that this covers the future from the perspective of the Babylon TV series, a future that we got only a glimpse of through prophecy and time distortions. <br /> <br />For the Babylon V fan, this entire trilogy is a must read.  I will definately be reading some more Babylon V books, hoping they are as good as this series has been.	2005-02-20

For anyone interested in the Treaty of Versailles, and how we got it, \\"Guilt at Versailles:  Lloyd George and the Pre-History of Appeasement\\" is your book.  Of course, the big three (Wilson, Lloyd George, and Clemenceau) are discussed in considerable detail.  However, what we also get are the way they (especially the later two) manipulated public opinion in their own countries, and were also directed by the press (especially in the case of Lloyd George in the persona of Northcliff.)  Lloyd George also was under pressure from representatives from Australia (Prime Minister Hughes) and South Africa (Jan Smuts) to get reparations, the result of which was the infamous \\"war guilt\\" clause. <br /> <br />Wilson came in with a completely different set of problems.  He came in as the idealist, with the Fourteen Points, nearly every one of which were under fire from the Europeans (adding Orlando of Italy to the French and British leaders).  After several months of wrangling, Wilson had to give up on many of his precious ideals.  Also troubling Wilson was the loss in the 1918 mid-term elections, which brought a Republican majority to Congress. <br /> <br />This book also looks at the variety of advisors (mostly for Lloyd George and Wilson) as well as Lloyd George's sometimes contentious relationship with the House of Commons. <br /> <br />One can't help but come away from this book with a better understanding of the Treaty and the notion of Realpolitik.  THis is really a political history of the Treaty more than anything else.  The writing is well done and a valuable collection to any library of the World War as well as political history.	2005-02-20

So, you think the currently accepted paradigm of China's so-called \\"peaceful rise\\" is accurate?  Have you been bamboozled by the stories of the gleaming new cities in China and the desires of China for peace?  If so, it isn't your fault.  This is a common thread since the rise (and even during the rebellion) of the Communists in China.  There are few better at manipulating American media and so-called scholars than the Chinese Communists. <br /> <br />This work is a survey history of the history of China's manipulation of the U.S. media and academia.  Some of it was deliberate manipulation, but there is also an element of anti-Americanism among those in the U.S. eagerly willing the stories coming from China. <br /> <br />Mosher does an excellent job of showing the history of that manipulation.  Those who said that China's communists believed in democracy have since been discredited.  Those who said that Chinese ate well during the Cultural Revolution have been discredited.  Those who believed that the Chinese Communists were headed toward a more gentle authoritarianism in the 1980s were painfully proven wrong once again in 1989.   <br /> <br />For those who blindly accept today's version of China, read these accounts of the mistakes of the past.  Doing so will cause you to step back a minute and look at the reality of today's China:  People's Armed Police, Christians and Falungong continually persecuted, along with Tibetan nuns and monks, propoganda-filled Chinese media, Gulag-style prisons known as laogai, escalating threats against its neighbors accompanied by a fearsome military build-up.  To this day, the government still denies entry to people known to oppose the regime. <br /> <br />This is an instructive work to the unintiated about the realities of China.  This will tell you more than anything else that you will ever read that you believe the current \\"super-story\\" regarding China at your peril.	2005-02-17

Vir was always the bumbling aide de camp for Londo, but he has taken on an entirely new role during this crisis faced by his homeworld, and I must say that it rather becomes him. <br /> <br />This volume covers the time period from 2267-2273.  Centauri Prime is falling deeper and deeper into the abyss and there is nothing Emperor Londo Mollari can do about it.  Durla has all but taken over all of the functions of government in Centauri Prime and the anti-foreigner campaign is taking a new life among the Centauri. <br /> <br />A small number are prepared to resist this new order, led by Vir.  Vir has help, namely from the mysterious technomages.  <br /> <br />Garibaldi and G-Kar come into the story about halfway through the book, and President Sheriden at the end.  This story very skillfully brings us from a hurting world, smarting from the beating it took at the hands of the Alliance to the subterfuge Durla and his followers use to rebuild Centauri strength.   <br /> <br />Sure, Earth parallels are in evidence, as I suppose seem to be inevitable.  However, for Babylon V fans, this storyline makes a lot of sense and is compelling.  For those not familiar with the Babylon V universe, get familiar with it and read book one before picking up this volume.  While this isn't heavy reading, the background information is highly useful for understanding what goes on in the book.	2005-02-16

However, while this does address Liu's treatment during the Cultural Revolution, it goes far beyond typical books of the genre. <br /> <br />In the words of the late-Arthur Miller, \\"But it is not quite the now-familiar tale of tortures and endless persecution, for there is a powerful stylistic directness, a wealth of detailed observation, and the passionate humanity of a witness and victim of the most surrealistic tyranny of this or any other age.\\"  This sentence is the most apt description, and it isn't surprising that it came from someone once persecuted due to perceived political views half-a-century ago. <br /> <br />This is a powerful read.  Liu Binyan joined the Communist Party during the anti-Japanese War in the 1940s.  His goal was idealistic, borne out of an undying love and patriotism for his country.  Sadly, the leaders of the Communist Party didn't have the same idealistic visions held by Liu.  Liu was constantly persecuted for trying to help the Party and thus the country.  Liu displays a passion for the common people of China that the Party cadres could have learned well from, but by in large would refuse to do. <br /> <br />This is very readable and compelling.  As a journalist himself, Liu has presented a compelling tale of the true situation during his life in China.  The fact that this is a translation from the original Chinese does little to detract from the attractiveness of the narrative. <br /> <br />Of interest to this China watcher was the use of time-worn phrases that the Chinese Communists use in the media, all of which within China is under their control.  While the phrases have changed to some extent, the media in China still uses such phrases to this day. <br /> <br />While this work is a bit dated in that it was published in 1990, many of the methods used by the media and the control of that media by the Chinese Communists hasn't changed significantly since the time this book was published.  <br /> <br />This book is a must read if you are interested in contemporary China, or if you are interested in the general topic of the human struggle for improvement and, most of all, liberty.	2005-02-13

Londo, now emperor, was involved with the Shadows, but betrayed them, something that the Drakh have not forgiven. <br /> <br />This book reintroduces us to some familiar characters, former Ambassador, now Emperor, Londo Mollari, his former aide de camp, now ambassador in his own right, Vir Cotto, Londo's divorced wive Mariel, and the one he kept Timov. <br /> <br />The storyline itself was written by J. Michael Straczinski, but the quality of the writing was not up to the level of the story itself.  For Babylon V fans, this is a must read due to the background info we gain about the situation on Centauri Prime.

However, right from the beginning of this third installment, Mara meets very personal tragedy. <br /> <br />House Anasati leads a powerful coalition of traditionalists who oppose the elimination of the Council and the office of Warlord.  However, Mara discovers an even more powerful force against change, a force that has kept the Empire in stagnation for thousands of years. <br /> <br />To defeat that power, Mara will once again have to leave the boundaries of the Empire and seek help from a very unlikely source.  Very difficult decisions are made right until the very end, and Mara will sacrifice much for the good of the Empire. <br /> <br />I have to admit that I like the way the cho-ja are portrayed in this novel and I am pleased that their history was developed to some extent in this final installment.  The story as a whole is riveting, making the book hard to put down.  One surprise after another keeps the reader engaged, tied together by the splended quality of the writing.  This entire series has been a delight to read, and unlike some series that end on a lull, this one keeps you on the edge of your proverbial seat right until the final chapter.	2005-02-09

Maps cover dozens of topics from the original settlement of North America to the 9/11 tragedy.  The maps are in black and white, making them easily used if you need to reproduce them.   <br /> <br />There is the downside that some of the maps are a little unclear.  There are also a couple of maps (#51 and 52) dealing with slavery that show the Indian Territory as a part of Texas. <br /> <br />However, for a teacher of High School U.S. History, this is a valuable supplement.  This is also recommended for any student of U.S. History (either high school or university) and anyone else who would like to get a spatial view of the currents of U.S. History. <br />	2005-02-05

The reading is dense in places and is highly academic, but for anyone who has a background in Taiwan's history and wants to get in depth, this would the volume for you. <br /> <br />Beginning from Taiwan's physical environment, other specialists focus on aboriginal Taiwan, the encroachment of the Minnan people, from the Dutch and Cheng to incorporation by the Ching Dynasty.  The late ninteenth century receives some coverage in depth.  There is also a frank assessment of the Japanese occupation years.    <br /> <br />About half of the book is devoted to post- World War II Taiwan. Political, religious, modernization and other topics of modern Taiwan are discussed in depth.  Unfortunately, due to the dating of the book, recent democratic developments are not covered (the book stops shortly following President Lee Tung Hui's popular election as President).  However, for anyone interested in developing a deeper understanding of Taiwan, other than actually living here, this book is one of the best options available.   <br /> <br />For the novice on Taiwan, I recommend reading Denny Roy's \\"Taiwan:  A Political History first.\\"  It is an excellent read and not as dense as this work.	2005-02-03

In fact, successors intensified it.  The rivalry between House Minwanabi and House Acoma would be played out from the estates to the distant lands of Tsubar far across the Southern Sea to the Holy City of Kentosani. <br /> <br />However, the Game of the Council becomes more intense, and even more dangerous when one of the Great Ones loses his temper and the Emperor himself involves himself in the Game. <br /> <br />The Game will return to Kentosani and the result will mean that the Empire will never be the same. <br /> <br />The story is well written and even when one thinks the climax of the story is on the way, there is more coming.  This is a book you can't put down and will want to read to the end.  Don't miss a word, or you may miss something. <br /> <br />These authors really present a compelling story, something that rivals the best series' of the genre.	2005-02-03

The Japanese influence can be seen even without the use of Japanese terms.  The roles of emperor, shogun, daimyo and samurai are all easy to see.  Also important is the code of honor that all Tsurani must play by.  The soldiers must abide by a code akin to the Japanese bushido (way of the warrior) and the lords (and lady in the case of Mara) have to play according to the rules of honor. <br /> <br />Infused with all of this is the politics, known as \\"the Game of the Council.\\"  Aspects of this are also derived from Japan.  The heads of all of the houses seek to gain advantage over the other, by all honorable means possible.  The dishonorable is allowed so long as you are not caught. <br /> <br />Enter into this intriging world Mara, a seventeen-year old girl just a few gongs from becomming initiated into the Order of Lashima in the Holy City of Kentosani.  Soldiers from her house arrive during the ceremony to announce that the is \\"Lady of the Acoma,\\" a chilling announcement that meant her father and brother were dead.  Thus, she was not only thrust into the Game of the Council, she was faced with a life and death struggle with the Lord of the Minwanabi, a clan with whom the Acoma had a long-standing blood feud.  While the Acoma had been weakened by Minwabi treachery, the Minwanabi were the most powerful House in the Empire. <br /> <br />Mara has to use her wits and her feminine wiles to make gains in the Game of the Council and to secure her House from its enemies.  Her greatest triumph in this volume occurs in the very house of the Minwanabi, where she is able to force dishonor on the host Lord. <br /> <br />The reading is compelling and the story well thought out.  You get a feeling for the complexity of the characters in the story.  The plot thickens with each of Mara's triumphs in the Game.  Unlike some stories, not everything ends well.  Good people as well as bad die through Mara's triumphs.  This book makes good reading and I am eager to get on to book two.	2005-01-28

However, the bulk of the book focuses on Post-World War II Taiwan.  While it focuses on the political history of the country, other aspects are not ignored.  My main criticism is that although this purports to be a political history, the main criticism of the legitimacy (or lack thereof) of \\"Chinese\\" sovereignty (regarding the so-called Post WWII transfer to China) over the country is ignored.  Save for that ommission, this is a servicable summary of modern Taiwan political history. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book for someone wishing to learn a little about Taiwan before coming to the country.  For a person wishing to engage in an in depth study of the country, this would be a good volume to start with.  However, if you already have a basic understanding of the major forces shaping this country (particularly post-World War II,) I would advise passing this work by for more in depth works on the subject.	2005-01-21

The issues selected are among the most controversial and important in foreign policy at the turn of the century. <br /> <br />The most intertesting to me, and one of the most covered, is how to deal with a rising power, namely China.  Among the four articles, there are a variety of perspectives presented.  Like other issues discussed in the book, the articles elucidate different perspectives and the editors allow the reader to decide for themselves what perspective they believe is the most applicable. <br /> <br />Other issues addressed concern American intervention and when intervention should occur, the efficacy of sanctions, trade policy, the handling of rogue nations (including Iran and North Korea), the role of the United Nations, and a discussion between those who see a hegemonic role of the United States as opposed to one where the United States works as a partner with others, in particular the transatlantic allies. <br /> <br />For people interested in international affairs, this is a must read.  This book is NOT recommended for the novice in the field who has little background knowledge.  However, for those who have an interest and the background knowledge, unless you have subscribed to the journal over the past eight years, this volume is an important part of any foreign policy library.	2005-01-20

Her very existance and the voicing of her beliefs is the ultimate heterodox to liberals who have long counted on a monopoly on the realm of public political discourse. <br /> <br />Coulter brings together an impressive array of examples of liberal hypocrisy and deceit, and even more impressive is the sheer volume of her source material.  Richer still is that she often uses the very words of the liberals that she opposes to display their hypocrisy.  An example is the fact that many liberals these days lament and decry \\"mandatory sentencing\\", however, they were the ones who were the most vocal proponents of this two decades ago. <br /> <br />Another example of liberal bias and deceit revolves around the supposedly \\"cerebral\\" Bill Bradley who scored below 500 on the verbal section of his SAT is celebrated for his alleged intelligence, while President Bush (43) is derided as being \\"dumb\\" and \\"stupid\\" despite the fact that he has degrees from two Ivy League universities. <br /> <br />The media's turnabout on Bob Packwood after he became expendable on the abortion issue is another case in point.  How can people like Kennedy and Byrd (the later being a former Klansman) get away with those affiliations is merely because they are advocates of positions favored by the liberal media establishment.  If they ever violated the liberal orthodoxy, they would be exposed for what they really are. <br /> <br />The above examples are but a small number of the well documented instances of liberal bias and lies regarding conservatives.  Her reasoning is solid.  The only way liberals can seem to even make a stab at her is either to lie, distort, or name-call.  Interestingly, she identified these very tactics in her book. <br /> <br />This book is a good read and recommended for those who are sick and tired of the fact that the typical liberal debate artillery consists of \\"you're stupid\\", \\"that's dumb,\\" and \\"you'rea liar.\\"	2005-01-19
US	49283520	R16XWGVK7HMBSI	0521663695	600674898	The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia: Volume One, Part One, from Early Times to c.1500	Books	5	24	25	N	N	Excellent Introduction to the Early History of SE Asia	Southeast Asia is often the forgotten sister of Asia in that when people study the region or mention it, they talk about China, Japan or India, and when Southeast Asia IS referred to, it is often in context with the Vietnam War and subsequent spinoff conflicts resulting from that war.  This is unfortunate, as Southeast Asia has a rich history with a variety of interesting and highly successful cultures.   <br /> <br />In this first of four volumes, Southeast Asia from prehistoric times to about A.D. 1500 is discussed in depth in five chapters written by different scholars addressing their individual specialties in the region.  This is what sets Cambridge Histories apart from most others. <br /> <br />J.D. Legge's article addresses the very history of the writting of Southeast Asia.  He discusses in depth the differences between Pre WWII and Post WWII scholarship.  World War II is when the region caught the attention of scholars due to importants in the war, and consequently, SE Asia studies programs blossomed, both in Western countries as well as in the Pacific Asia region. <br /> <br />Peter Bellwood talks about prehistoric Southeast Asia.  The various environmental regions (especially of the island regions) is explored in depth.  Also of import is the expansion of Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) languages from its hearth in Taiwan into Southeast Asia and its consequent spread both eastward into the Pacific as well as westward to Madagascar off the African coast. <br /> <br />Keith Taylor discusses the early kingdoms of the region.  Vietnam, Champa, Angkor (Cambodia), Pagan (Burma), Ayutthaya (Thailand), Srivajaya (mostly Southern Sumatra) and Majapahit (Java) are discussed in detail.  Their evolution as Indianized states (with the exception of Vietnam) is discussed, and the conventional wisdom of the nature of that Indianization is challenged in convincing fashion. <br /> <br />Kenneth Hall talks about the nature of the economies of the early Southeast Asian kingdoms.  He makes the distinctions between rice-based economies and those based on trade.  Especially successful was East Java due to its access both to rich agricultural areas and its geographic proximity to the Spice Islands over which much of the world trade focused on during that time in history.  The case is made that this region of Southeast Asia dominated global trade in the centuries leading up to the 16th century. <br /> <br />J.G. de Casparis and I.W. Mabbett discusses religion, and once again, the issue of Indianization pops up.  The differentiation of mainland and island Southeast Asia is brought up, concluding with the beginnings of Islam in kingdoms like Aceh as we approach the 16th century. <br /> <br />This is all highly academic, as one would expect from Cambridge.  However, this also reflects the most recent scholarship on this very diverse and fascinating region of the world.  Given the importance of this region today in terms of global trade and the war on terror, an understanding of this region has never been more important.  This book has a lot to recommend it for a study of the early history of the region.  I am looking forward to going through later volumes.	2005-01-18

They cite the Great Wall being designed to keep out foreigners and resistance to Christianity and the refusal of the McCartney mission in  the 1790s to prove this.  However, all through history, the Chinese have  indeed engaged the world and have been influenced by it.  Waley-Cohen does  an excellent job of narrating this in her book.<br />She reveals all through  Chinese history how the Chinese adopted religious ideas from overseas  (notably India), science (initially from Islamic regions and later  Westerners), to the 1960s, when many Westerners assumed that China was  closed to the world because it was closed to them.  In fact, China was open  to other Asians and to Africans.<br />Waley-Cohen's writing is easily readible  and is of value both to the China watcher like myself, as well as the  layperson wishing to understand the &quot;Middle Kingdom&quot; a bit  better.	2000-07-28
