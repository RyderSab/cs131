This book is simply a nicely printed version of the very limited info that comes on the Office v X CD ROM \\"Getting Started\\" file.  They really mean just getting started.  This book is a little bit expanded with a few nubbins of extra detail, but not much. This is NOT a Power User's Guide. A  guide for a beginner to both Office and OS X, at best, with some glaring missing areas.<br />Useful in case you just like to have a printed version of the bare basics instead of needing to use or print out the electronic help/info.pdf material which is basic at best. A more readable and accessible version of the electronic material. If you've been using earlier versions of Office, you don't need this book. I bought it only because I've skipped two Office version generations, but the basics don't seem to have changed much.<br />There is some useful expansion of the Entourage procedures particularly on the Calendar which is  good, beyond the CD ROM material. <br />Entourage e-mail is essentially identical with the outstanding OS X Mail package which is nicely described in Pogue's OS X: The Missing Manual. If Entourage is new to you as it is to me, you may find the additional detail handy.<br />I haven't found any reason to go to the trouble of shifting my mail to Entourage from the extremely useful OS X Mail system. Unless you don't start with OS X Mail before you buy Office, you may not find the Entourage mail material of any use.<br />This book should be avoided if you plan to exploit the many facets of Office, a great many of which are either unknown to the author or never used by him.  For instance, the basics of creating mailing labels, a common and very useful function, is treated only lightly and then only as using an existing address book as merge data as a project.  Nary a word on how to create individual or a sheet of mailing labels from scratch, or using Avery or other label formats, a fatal deficiency for what purports to be a \\"Power User\\" guide...	2002-07-14

The reference material in the back includes useful listings of data on the objects described in the book, the constellations, the Messier Objects, an excellent Bibliography and useful addresses listing many web sites in both cases, in addition to a Star Atlas.  <br />The unusual atlas included at the back is appropriate for the magnitudes of the objects described in the book. Unfortunately the author failed to include a crucial bit of information for each description by omitting a page reference for the location of the objects in the Atlas.  Perhaps this will be corrected in a future edition of a book which will certainly merit further printings.<br />Despite this annoying defect, this is a good buy and a valuable tool for a beginning star observer. Although some of the objects described can be seen with good binoculars and a few with the naked eye, you will need at least a 100mm telescope or better to see many of them.	2002-06-21

I find it difficult to believe that any of the reviewers who gave this book 5 stars have read the book. 4 1/2 must surely relate to awe of the author.  My rating is five stars for Chapter 6, one for all the rest.<br />The reviewer who stated \\"Hardly anything in here is known to exist. Things like 11-dimensional supergravity, p-branes, and a number of other things he mentions are nothing more than purely theoretical constructs that have no verification in the real universe. They exist only in his mind.\\",  has hit the nail squarely and completely on the head and little more need be said on the relevance of the subjects Hawking presents to the average person. <br /> Describing the matter contained in the book as theories is questionable.  Theories are accepted if they provide predictions that can be verified or refuted.  It is unlikely that any of the theories which describe multi-dimensional spacetime, p-branes (those of us for whom he wrote the book?), strings, supergravity, time loops and other fascinating but useless concepts in the real world, will ever be either verified or refuted.  Should a theory not be accompanied by a suggestion for testing it?  How does one approach describing a test to verify or refute the theory associated with worm-holes?  What real world information indicates the existence or structure of any of these concepts? Hawkings leaves that out.<br />On the positive side, Amazon's price for the book is nearly a gift for two parts of the book alone, the Glossary and Chapter 6, Our Future? Star Trek or Not?. Chapter 6 is a highly thought provoking shot at predicting our future in terms of the real world, and is probably accurate.  The Glossary contains most of the useful matter in the book. Many of the superb illustrations in this well produced  book also contain interesting concepts, but as other reviewers have stated, they fall short of clarifying their targets.  Try to find this book in your local public library, read Chapter 6, xerox the Glossary, and put the book quickly back on the shelf before getting totally bemused/confused by the rest of it.<br />All of the books' subject matter is grist for the mills of brains such as Hawkings', but you should pass on this book unless you are curious to read material incomprehensible to lesser mortals.  Much material is simply thrown at you with no hint of rationale - take it or leave it - Hawking has spoken - the arrogance factor mentioned by another reviewer.  <br />Better reading is \\"Show Me God\\" by Fred Heeren.	2002-01-28

The figure formats and content are almost identical to those in the excellent \\"Stars\\" book by Rey,  which Ramo offers as a reference, and the contents of which are pretty much repeated or paraphrased, spread amongst the 365 day notes in Ramo's book.  Brief notes, not essays in most cases - but interesting. I can only think of something like six or seven other books that contain similar or more material, but in much cleaner and more scientific form with useful indexing not contained in Ramo's book, with lovely colored figures, - but their total cost is higher in some cases.   Beginning readers with binoculars or small telescopes will search in vain for many of the deep space objects discussed by Ramo since many are not visible without large apertures.  There is one instance under May 23rd where Sigma Octans is mentioned as near the southern celestial pole, but  is not shown on the nearby figure of the pole area which shows four other stars. You need to search a page or two around some of the daily notes to find the illustration which goes with the discussion. The book could have used a good editor, a little more polish, and some indication of which of the objects mentioned are not visible to the naked eye, binocs, or a small scope.  The other reviewers were correct that you need a real star chart to go with this book.   The book \\"Skywatching\\", by Levy, sold by Amazon at a lower price than this one, is a far better choice.  There is some interesting verbiage in this book, but the book is for enjoyable, very light reading, not for skywatching. I enjoyed reading it, but I take a Levy, Tirion, or Dickinson pub out with my eyes, my binocs, or any telescope to look into space.  Enter those authors in the Amazon Search engine space and you'll find a lot of better choices for amateur astronomy. Save this one for a fun read on cloudy nights by the fire, and then give it to a grand child which is where mine is going.	2001-06-24

Whether you will use naked eye, binoculars, or a telescope for star hopping, this is a priceless book.  I recommend the hard copy version as you will keep this book so busy for so long through more than one generation, you will demolish the paperback version.  This book is for all ages, from beginning readers on up.  The first copy came into our family thirty years ago and is still in use along with two others being passed around. When you think you have mastered this book, graduate to &quot;Turn Left at Orion&quot;,  the next step in excellence in amateur observational astronomy.	2001-05-14

The hardback version I use is no longer available, but the paperback is  just as good, if perishable. Sometimes, preparing really great recipes can  be involved, but in the case of these, it's worth it.  Most of them are  quite simple compared to many other soup cookbooks, using only needed  ingredients to achieve excellence if you can read and chop an onion. If you  haven't got time to cook most of these fine dishes, try McDonalds, the  drive-thru is really fast and you don't have to cook at all.	2000-09-09

Clancy must have been smoking something strong when he let his name be put on this one. Agree with the classification of this one for the kiddies.  Must be at least 99% Pieczenik.  No Clancy here at all.	2000-03-13
