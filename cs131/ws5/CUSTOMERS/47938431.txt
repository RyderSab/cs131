It compares well with later books from the series that I've read.  I give it 4.5 stars - rounded up to 5.<br /><br />This book has the usual assortment of likeable Discworld-type characters - with \\"The Luggage\\" stealing the show.<br /><br />If someone was just starting out with the Discworld Series, I think this would be a really good place to start.	2005-10-12

While REVELATION SPACE was definately better than CHASM CITY, it suffers from same pros and cons:<br /><br />PROS: Interesting and inventive technologies, and an overall decent plot.<br /><br />CONS: Unlikeable characters, long-winded and overly-twisted presentation, and akwardly unbelievable ending.<br /><br />These books are HUGE, this one coming in at 585 paperback pages.  Unfortunately, there are few truly exciting passages, and unlike the equally-long/somewhat-similar but more exciting/likeable Peter F. Hamilton SciFi novels, these books are something of a chore to wade thru.<br /><br />Part of my problem with these books is that they are set more in the far-off future (mid-26th Century) than books I normally like to read... the technology becomes too abstract, and when you throw in a bunch of unlikeable characters and an overly-complicated plot, I keep finding myself wondering why, when there have been so many other books by other authors that I've enjoyed so much more (Peter F. Hamilton, A. Bertram Chandler, Isaac Asimov, Elizabeth Moon, and David Drake for example), or even enjoyed slightly more (Jack McDevitt, Harry Turtledove, Allen Steele), why would I keep going on this series of books when there are so many other books that I would probably like better out there?  At some point, when working your way thru certain book series, you have to say \\"this just isn't working out\\"... this is what happenned to me half-way thru the C.J. Cherryh Atevi Series - I finally said \\"enough is enough\\"... I'm not sure I'm going to go on to the next books in this series (REDEMPTION SPACE and ABSOLUTION GAP) anytime soon (even though I already purchase them, and they are sitting on my bookshelf waiting to be read).	2005-09-18

It involves the book cover, which is wrong in at least two significant ways... 1) Spacesuits were NOT necessary for the humans to walk about on \\"Home\\".  2) The lizard-like aliens, depicted on the cover, don't have \\"body paint\\"; which was discussed ENDLESSLY in the books from this series, and  examples of which should have obviously been included on this cover drawing.  So, what could have been the best bookcover of the series, ends up being the worst.<br /><br />Many folks say they are glad this series is apparently over.  However, I must say that I would support at least one more book in this \\"Sam Yeager\\" series; which could involve visits to the other two worlds in the Race's Empire, as well as the USA (and maybe others Earth powers) colonizing new worlds.	2005-08-26

That being said, I found the first part of the book to be top-notch - maybe even better than the later books... I especially liked the barroom altercation scenes, and some of the names of the bars from Ankh-Morpork, like THE STAB IN THE BACK.<br /><br />The middle part of the book was decent enough, involving lots of magic and fantasy - but this continues without much change in the latter part of the book, which doesn't contain a lot of stuff that \\"makes you laugh\\", which I've come to expect from Pratchett's later works.<br /><br />In the final analysis, this is a good book, and a decent kick-off to the series.<br /><br />A friend at work, to whom I lent his first Pratchett Discworld book, has become a Discworld fanatic, and is ripping his way thru the series, tossing me the books he finishes along the way... so,  I've got quite a queue of Discworld paperbacks stacked up, and I'm looking forward to moving on to EQUAL RITES next.	2005-08-19

The quality of this SEVENTH book of the series is definately below that of the first six books - mainly due to the author apparently running out of believable material and unique situations for his characters, and having to use too many gimmicks in order to fill up the 600+ paperback pages.  For example, how do so many of the characters end up at some point in Edmonton, Canada?  And how many times can Sam Yeager foil assasination attempts by trained killers?<br /><br />Another problem is the lack of attention \\"The Race\\" (and humans for that matter) pay to the radialogical after-effects of the nuclear war that ensued in book six... after all, it was the fear of \\"nuclear contamination\\" that had supposedely kept the lizards from using their nuclear advantage in the first place.  When so little side-effects of contamination occur, it makes the whole series seem less believable.  Yes, this contamination is sometimes mentioned - but it is severly downplayed... I can remember what a stir the Chernobyl disaster caused in real life, and I see probably less attention given to the problem of the exchange of 100's of nukes (fission or fusion - it never is really explained).<br /><br />Furthermore, the book includes even more than the normal amount of \\"review\\" material, with character's situations being long-windedly over-explained.<br /><br />At this point, I want to give the author some credit for fixing some mistakes he made in previous books.  For example, a number of times in previous books, he referred to the \\"sandstone\\" architecture of Jerusalem; and in this book he correctly refers to the \\"limestone\\" architecture.<br /><br />Also, I credit the author with being able to do as well as he did over the course of seven books - it is no wonder he begins to run out of gas here.<br /><br />I give this book 2.5 stars, rounded up to 3.<br /><br />I'd previously obtained a copy of the last book in the series (Homeward Bound); otherwise I'd probably have taken a break from the series at this point (never to return?).

While this book is certainly entertaining, it is getting harder and harder to get really excited about the characters and subplots, as there is too much repetition and review of old situations and characters (they are just getting older now, and/or changed locations).<br /><br />Like some of the earlier books from this series, this one \\"ends with a bang\\" - but I'm not going to go into detail, as it could spoil the ending.<br /><br />Still, Turtledove comes up with just enough variety in characters and plot situations, that I kept turning the pages; for example, we start to see pets, livestock, and vegetation from \\"The Home Planet\\" start to take hold on Earth; and we start to see certain  human \\"Independent Not-Empires\\" expand their space programs to the point that they can start exploring and exploiting the Asteroid Belt.<br /><br />I plan on continuing this marathon series to the finish line, and I give this particular book 3.5 stars, rounded down to 3.	2005-07-20

Hamilton book I've read (after PANDORA'S STAR), and I'm definately still impressed with his ability to crank out a large number of quality pages in his books.<br /><br />Hamilton gives us a good sample of future Earth's colonies, which are attempting to break off from Earth's dominance, and are subjected to \\"asset realization\\" missions, generally undertaken by aggressive corporations who have bought out the interests in the colonies from the corporations who initially funded the colonies, and who were not seeing any profits from their long-term investments.  The visit to oxygen-rich Santa Chico ends up being the most interesting, in my opinion.<br /><br />The corporation Lawrence hooks up with (Zantiu-Braun) employs biological strength-enhancing technology, known as \\"Skin\\".  This technology, along with the spaceflight, weaponry, genetics, and alien technology, is quite interesting and believable.<br /><br />In FALLEN DRAGON, I only found one major subplot that appeared too contrived; involving circumstances surrounding the main character Lawrence's girlfriend Rebecca.  Otherwise, I was quite impressed with the various other subplots.  In fact, I found the brief affair between conservative Lawrence and liberal Joona to be quite believable.<br /><br />While there are obvious openings for a sequel at the end of this book, I'm kind of glad there never actually has been one.  I think the storyline had been played out as much as possible.  Having said that, I'm looking forward to the sequel to PANDORA'S STAR, and one of these days, I'll start on Hamilton's Night's Dawn series of six books.	2005-07-09
US	47938431	R1T3XZSY8JVBZ3	0812540395	545337496	For Love and Glory	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Incomplete	Like a lot of the written sentences found in this far-future SciFi novel, the entire book has a herky-jerky and incomplete feeling.<br /><br />It is not a very large book (about 300 hardcover pages, set in a large font, with LOTS of blank space at the ends of the numerous small chapters).  This book was apparently Poul Anderson's last work... and as this book was posthumously published, I have to think the author didn't quite finish it, and others undertook the task to fill in the blanks and get it published.  There are many gaps and abrupt transitions in the story, and along with many grammatical oddities, and a slew of similar-sounding Swedish names, it often is hard to follow what is going on.  Indeed, there are many times when two or more characters will be communicating, and the the identity of the speaker in a given paragraph becomes a complete mystery.<br /><br />At times the story gets somewhat interesting, especially some of the parts relating to the Torben Hebo character, who has lived so long thru multiple rejuvinations that his brain is full of memories, and he can't function properly without electing to undergo a procedure to backup and purge away old memories to make way for new.<br /><br />However, the interesting parts of the book aren't enough to make up for Lissa's sappy \\"love interests\\" with Valen, Hebo, and others; and shallow characters like Esker Harolsson.  I was also unimpressed by the space-travel technology; with humans and aliens unexplainably able to zip instantaneously to any point in the Universe... yet, these same beings who can zip around instantly throughout the galaxy are \\"awed\\" by two colliding Black Holes, which supposedly will \\"unlock great secrets of the universe\\".  When the black holes collide, the author spends a great deal of time going into excruciating detail describing what the event would look like - it ends up sounding like a description of any modern fireworks show... seeing fireworks is exciting - reading about them is boring.<br /><br />If you are interested in reading some of the works of the Poul Anderson, I'm sure you could find much better examples than this book.  I remember reading three Hugo Award-Winning shorter-length stories of Mr. Anderson from the 1960's, which still hold up well today (he won 7 Hugos overall).interested in reading some of the works of the Poul Anderson, I'm sure you could find much better examples than this book.

However, the same format is followed, with 20 chapters, containing about 6 passages each... it is this consistant format that allows Mr. Turtledove to tirelessly crank out the text to fill these series.

He is able to maintain the same level of quality that was seen in the first two books from the series (IN THE BALANCE and TILTING THE BALANCE), and able to invent enough new scenarios and produce enough excitement to keep the reader turning the pages - as well as create a fireworks spectacular-like ending, to keep readers moving on to the next book in the series.<br /><br />While the interwoven storylines basically follow the plight of the characters introduced in the first two books, a few new characters are introduced in this volume, and a number of the main characters do end up getting killed off, as the war escalates (I won't spoil things by mentioning exactly who does bite the dust).	2005-05-27

The two works generally focus on the space-faring adventures of Myron Tany.  Myron graduates from university, where against his parents' wishes he concentrated his studies more on space-related topics, than on a purely practical business regimen.  In fairly short order, he manages to obtain the captaincy of his eccentric and aging Aunt's spaceship (which she acquires via a defamation lawsuit), and sets out with her to search for a fountain of youth on a distant planet.  The Aunt is easily swayed by good-looking suitors, and she eventually takes up with another in a string of false-intentioned suitors, who she replaces Myron with as Captain of her spaceship.  Luckily, Myron is able to hook up a crew slot in the four-crew space-merchant ship GLICCA, and begins to travel to strange and distant ports of call throughout the Galaxy.<br /><br />**** PORTS OF CALL (1996) - You can't help considering that Jack Vance was about 80 when he wrote this story.  It is almost like going back in time, and reading a SciFi story from the 1960's.  His deep vocabulary is quite impressive, and I found myself consulting a dictionary every few pages or so.  Unfortunately, some of the technical areas don't fair so well - for example, the computer technology seems like something out of the late 1980's, and was basically out-of-date even before the book was written.  There is one particular section of the book that is extremely engrossing; it involves Myron making the acquantance of a waitress during a visit to a tavern on a planet where taking of off-worlders' \\"pelts\\" is not unheard of... very eerie.<br /><br />*** LURULU (2004) - Jack Vance was about 88 when he finished writing this story.  While it is quite a bit shorter than PORTS OF CALL, it is consistent in quality.  I found a few particular sections of the book to be of superb interest, and enjoyed the book to the point that I was sorry when I reached the end.<br /><br />I recently read Jack Vance's Hugo-winning novella DRAGON MASTERS (1963), and it ranks with the best SciFi I've ever read... and now that I've had more of a sampling of his work, I'm becoming a big Jack Vance fan.lar sections of the book to be of superb interest, and enjoyed the book to the point that I was sorry when I reached the end.

Mr. Turtledove does an excellent job of describing the mindset of the addicts - for some reason I especially enjoy following the progress of the Veteran Alien Tank Driver Ussmak (who has to face both Nazi Panzer tactics as well as his ginger addiction), and the Alien pilot/prisoner Teerts (whom the Japanese purposefully addict).<br /><br />This 2nd book from the series literally \\"ends with a bang\\", and I'm looking forward to continuing with this series - which is turning out to be almost as addicting to me as ginger is to the Lizards.	2005-05-13

I mean, really, couldn't whoever wanted to get Chris think of a simpler way to do it - like gun him down when he goes out for coffee?

These stories originally appeared in various SciFi magazines during the late-50s thru mid-60's.  I somehow managed to get thru all the stories, and following are reviews of each of them:<br /><br />** MED SHIP MAN (Novellete, 1963) - While the technology used by the bad guys is believable, the plot involves too many coincidences.  The pushy businessman character who basically forces his way down to the \\"apparently deserted\\" planet is way too shallow.  Calhoun obviously doesn't like ANY businessmen, supposedly because of the way the businessmen treated people and animals on the planet Texia.  With the mystery of the deserted planet just beginning, almost immediately Calhoun suspects the businessmen as the bad guy.  Well, the businessman ends up being from Texia, and he is involved with a scheme using cattle herding technology from Texia, to herd people on Maya away from the cities, so he can buy prime real estate dirt cheap.<br /><br />** PLAGUE ON KRYDER II (Novellete, 1964) - The trusting Calhoun bumbles thru and dodges multiple attempts on his life while interfering with a pack of interstellar bandits who take advantage of planets, upon which they have unleashed plagues.<br /><br />** THE MUTANT WEAPON (Novella, 1957) - A story of a biological warfare attack on a newly colonized planet.  This story contains some excellent detailed descriptions of Leinster's Planetary Grid and Interstellar Drive technologies, but also contains a lot of backward technology; for example, reel-to-reel tape drives.  There are some good parts that give a decent picture of the horrors of germ warfare<br /><br />**+ RIBBON IN THE SKY (Novellete, 1957) - A semi-decent story, with more backwards technology (e.g. Calhoun has to manually perform photo comparisons, something a computer has been able to do long ago).  The most interesting parts are related to human biological theories, based on separated human populations; and this even leads to a bit of romance.  This is possibly the best story of the collection (but that isn't saying much).<br /><br />** TALLIEN THREE (Novellete, 1963) - Calhoun & Murgatroyd arrive at planet to do a routine medical survey, and lo and behold, the planet is experiencing a biologically-based revolution, that ends up being masterminded by yet another mad scientist gone bad.  Crummy plot in general, but the nightmarish technology causing the population to be turned into garbage-eating ghouls is unique, to say the least, and future computer technologies are described pretty well, considering this was written in 1963.<br /><br />** QUARANTINE WORLD (Novellete, 1966) - A seemingly pefectly healthy world undergoes a Medical Service inspection - but things are just a bit too perfect.  It turns out that another \\"plague\\" is being hidden from the rest of the Galaxy, for \\"evil business purposes\\" (Leinster is definately a socialist, if not a communist, at heart).  Nothing very different about this story than the rest.<br /><br />* THE GRANDFATHERS' WAR (Novellete, 1957) - A colony is forced to evacuate their younger people to another star system, when their star becomes unstable and threatens to go nova.  The overworked younger people become embittered against the older generation and rebel.  Oh, and of course there is great sickness brewing amongst the youngest people on the new colony... this story could have actually been good, given a Twilight Zone-like ending - but it ends up with some highly unlikely rocket heroics by Calhoun, and a sappy kiss-and-makeup ending.<br /><br />** PARIAH PLANET (Novella, 1961) - Calhoun is sent to a sector neglected by the Med Service for far too long, and encounters a planet whose inhabitants are subjected to famine and rascist isolationism by another more well to do planet in a nearby solar system.  This could have been one of the better stories in the book, but the persistant meddling by Calhoun in the two planets' affairs made me think that MED SHIP didn't stand for MEDical SHIP, but really stood for MEDdling SHIP.<br /><br />At the time this review was written, this book was available on the Baen Online Free Library (and if it wasn't, I wouldn't have wanted to pay more than a bargain-shelf book price to read this dated collection of SciFi stories).<br /><br />Murray Leinster was considered one of the pioneers of \\"modern\\" SciFi writing, and was a longtime mainstay of the genre.  If nothing else, some folks might get a kick out of sampling some of his writing by reading one or two of the stories from this anthology.  He does a pretty good job describing some of his more advanced technologies; for instance the Planetary landing grids, and interstellar travel mechanisms.  However, his older stories didn't even foresee the use of observation satellites or spy planes which were to become common place just a few years after the stories were written (in the book rockets are launched to take photographs).  And, lets face it, the stories are somewhat slow-paced/dull, and the character development does not stand up to what we expect to find in present day SciFi stories.  Oh, and could we have some good-looking women, please?  And finally, these stories have a strong and naïve socialist leaning (in one story all businessmen are seen as evil, and in others economic classes are virtually non-existent).<br /><br />NOTE1: Some folks have complained about the incessant repetition of simple facts... the reason there is so much repetition, is because this is a collection of independent stories that were originally designed to be read separately; so, in each story he has to repeat descriptions of technologies and main character's traits (especially Murgatroyd's).

I rate it 4.5 stars - oh, what the heck, round it up to 5.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, time travel is always a bit gimmicky; but, in NIGHT WATCH, it plays only a background role, and it is done in a unique way... anyway, with Pratchett, you know going in that you aren't going to be dealing with reality.<br /><br />I'm impressed with Pratchett's ability to make me laugh, or at least chuckle, so many times while reading his books.  This is truly a unique gift.  I'm also impressed how much I get taken in by his main characters - you can't help rooting for these guys... and the Vimes main character in NIGHT WATCH is no exception; I found myself really pulling for him when he deals with the REALLY bad guys (like Carcer, and The Unmentionables).  And, besides the good guys and the bad guys, there is also all the usual assortment of oddball characters thrown into the mix, and you don't know what side they will end up on, in the final big struggle at the end of this book.<br /><br />For my next Pratchett book, I intend to read MONSTEROUS REGIMENT... I had lent three Pratchett books that I'd picked up from Amazon, and other sources, to a friend at work, and he has since become a HUGE Terry Pratchett fan - I expect he will be loaning me some of the books he's picked up soon (although he tells me the earlier Discworld books aren't as good as the later ones from the series).	2005-04-13

I usually read Science Fiction, and mostly Military SciFi at that; so mixing Alternate Military History with Aliens from other worlds isn't that different from what I normally choose to read.<br /><br />To be honest with you, the quality of this story is actually above what I normally read - the characters are better developed and more varied than in most Military Scifi books.  The aliens, their culture, and and their level of technology are believable.<br /><br />This is neither a \\"quick read\\", nor a \\"slow read\\"... I found it to be evenly paced, with each chapter containing enough intersting material to keep things interesting.  Indeed, the ability of Mr. Turtledove to crank things out at such an even pace is almost eerie - with each Chapter coming in consitantly at almost exactly 28 pages.<br /><br />A few \\"warnings\\" about content:  1) There is a decent amount of sexual situations and scenes, but they are well done, and fit within the storyline.  2) This being a military-oriented book, there is of course a fair amount of violence and bloodshed.  3) This book does not contain an \\"ending\\", as it is part of an ongoing series.	2005-04-12

A lot of the science is quite unique; like the Wellstone material that can quickly form into almost any other imaginable material, or the anti-gravityish \\"ertial\\" (opposite of inertial) technology Bruno(the main character) invents that helps to propel his \\"rescue ship\\" to near lightspeed.<br /><br />I wasn't used to the author's method of writing, so it felt a little odd reading the first chapter or so - but once I got used to it, the odd feeling wore off, and I found the book quite enjoyable, if not a quick read.<br /><br />In addition to the science, the reluctant-hero plight of most of the main characters is fairly interesting; but there could have been a bit more variety to these characters, with too many having the same traits.<br /><br />I got this book as part of the SFBC MONARCHS OF SOL anthology, and I'm moving on to the 2nd book of the set - THE WELLSTONE.	2005-04-01

A bit of a change of pace from his more recent Hutchison-world novels (Deepsix, Chindi, Omega), it is more of a Mystery than his previous Action-Adventures.<br /><br />While it has one of McDevitt's typical \\"saved at the last second by rope or net tricks\\", which can get so tiresome - it is done a bit differently (with a makeshift rope), and at least he holds it down to one in this decent-sized book.  Also, as usual, a number of the characters will get killed off during the course of the story; but again, it is done in a slightly different way, so that you don't feel like you're reading the same book all over again (as was happening with the Hutch series).<br /><br />Readers of this story might find it a bit confusing at times, with so many characters to keep track of, and so much chasing around the galaxy to different places.  If you aren't reading it straight thru, you will probably find it necessary to back up and review to get your bearings every once and awhile.<br /><br />I got the feeling that this book was NOT hurried to press, as I didn't find any major typos, inconsistancies, or grammatical mistakes that hamper so many rushed-to-press novels these days.	2005-03-22

Indeed, the subtitle in Chapter 30 reads \\"Imperial Valley - August 10th\\" - but, the characters are heading out of San Jose towards SoCal, and are actually in California's Central valley (or San Joaquin Valley)... Imperial Valley is hundreds of miles away... this is typical of the sudden falloff in quality - it is almost like you find yourself reading a different book, with too many contrived scenes - it must have something to do with a publishing deadline.	2005-03-19

It points out that the \\"global warming fear\\" is just one of the latest fads in a string of groundless widespread fears; before that we had communism, and now we have terrorism, etc. ... and that there is a continuous stream of groundless fears that are being churned out by academia, and promoted by politicians and the media to keep us in a constant STATE OF FEAR.<br /><br />It is funny to see the extreme negative reactions to this book, as these reactions form the basis of the book in the first place - that people have a hard time dealing with concepts that upset the status quo, or that contradict their engrained beliefs (especially the silly Global Warming Panic)... they basically shut their minds to opposing argument, no matter how good the arguments are.  Too bad, because I think Chichton does a good job of laying out possible approaches to dealing with \\"environmental cronyism\\" at the end of the book.<br /><br />He comes up with so many good examples of where bad environmentalism has caused more problems than it has solved -  Yellowstone Park, and DDT for example.  But that doesn't mean the author is anti-environment (WHO IS!?), he simply wants people to think, and make informed decisions - not simply follow the latest media/academic/political fad.  For example, the same people who needlessly FREAKED OUT 20 years ago about \\"power line caused cancers\\" are now buying \\"therapeutic\\" electromagnatic devices that they clamp on their arms and legs!<br /><br />... and you can't miss the part when the stereotypical know-nothing Hollywood Actor Environmental Activist with a holier-than-thou attitude gets his come-uppance (and the real reason why you will NEVER see this book made into a Hollywood movie, like many of his previous works).u will NEVER see this book made into a Hollywood movie, like many of his previous works).	2005-03-14

While it was obviously impossible for him to completely jettison the silly manmade-created \\"Greenhouse Cliff\\" premise (which includes widespread manmade-caused earthquakes!?), it is moved far enough into the background in this book that it can be almost ignored.  Strong technology strongpoints are:<br /><br />Nanotechnology - New flexible spacesuits, and \\"gobblers\\", whose inventor plays the role of Dr. Frankenstein.<br /><br />Radiation - We get a good scientific explanation, and some good  examples of it in various parts of the story.<br /><br />Kinetic Energy Weapons/Defenses - These weapons (rocks, really) see increased use in this book.<br /><br />Indeed, there is one excellent subplot where all three of these technologies are brought together -- which inludes a very believable sequence showing how The Cromwell's Captain balances his fears (of death vs. failure) to decide how and when he releases his weapons against Vesta.<br /><br />Drugs - Dorik Harbin continues in his role of the designer drug-driven mercenary, clearly showing that he would have been better off to \\"just say no\\", but why his inner demons start him and keep him going on his ever-worsening habit.<br /><br />The book ends with a couple of obvious lead-ins to future (and probably non-Asteroid based) stories, which I won't get into details, as it could potentially spoil the ending if you know who comes out alive.<br /><br />Oh, and I also found it to be an interesting parallel that Bova felt it necessary to throw in his usual token spanish phrase (both of which he muffed in the first two books), and he gets it right this time!necessary to throw in his usual token spanish phrase (both of which he muffed in the first two books), and he gets it right this time!	2005-03-12

While the science is still a bit sketchy, and there are actually less climactic moments in this book than the first one; this book is more consistant, and the story holds together better than the first book; which had the idiotic \\"invisible suit\\" gimmick that was thankfully left out this time around.<br /><br />If the author could somehow steer away from the original silly premise of mankind-caused global catastrophic environmental upheavals, these books would rate much better.  The \\"Greenhouse Cliff\\" premise is silly enough (and thankfully was not brought up much in this book, as in the last), but the implied idea that mankind's \\"follies\\" could somehow cause ongoing and massive earthquakes is simply ridiculous.	2005-03-05

I had been hesitant to purchase it in the first place, as the series was based on the premise of \\"runaway global warming\\", which is a shaky premise to begin with... however, the rest of the storyline appeared to be interesting, and I wanted to try a Ben Bova offering, so I decided to go for it.<br /><br />Exact dates are never actually mentioned in the book, but certain clues place the story sometime in the later part of the 21st century, most likely around the year 2075.<br /><br />Decent character development - with some characters switching sides back and forth from the \\"bad guys\\" to the \\"good guys\\", and one really \\"evil\\" character.  A few interestingly suspenseful parts; and while the fusion drive, nanotechnology, and solar radiation science parts weren't bad, I was dismayed with the number of inconsistancies, bad science, and poor predictions made in this book written 2001, for example:<br /><br />- It is stated that automobile companies in the middle 21st century were still having trouble getting the public to buy electric-powered automobiles, and wanted to add gasoline-powered engine sound effects to make their cars more sellable to the public - heck, here we are in the year 2005, and we already have a number of manufacturers offering efficient electric hybrids, which are beginning to sell quite well, and we obviously don't need any sound-effect gimmicks.<br /><br />- In the Mid-21st century, religious right-wingers control the government (fair enough), but they are over-taxing businesses and control the media?  Odd, because these are two specific things right-wingers just won't do (overtax business, or control media).<br /><br />- The runaway global warming premise is taken to absurdity - with Greenland's ice cap on the verge of a total meltdown, and there is even talk of Antarctica's ice cap melting down - all due to man-made causes? This is junk science cubed.<br /><br />- The author uses one spanish phrase in the book, and muffs it;  \\"your welcome\\" is \\"de nada\\", not \\"da nada\\"... that, and other grammatical errors suddenly start to show up in the last few sections of the book, like the book's editors ran out of gas right at the end.<br /><br />While these (and other) items were annoying, the invisible stealth suit gimmick that shows up half way into the book was absolutely awful. I don't want to \\"spoil\\" anything, as this situation plays a significant part in the story, but suffice it to say that this gimmick was so poorly concocted, and so badly out of place that it was almost laughable.r uses one spanish phrase in the book, and muffs it;  \\"your welcome\\" is \\"de nada\\", not \\"da nada\\"... that, and other grammatical errors suddenly start to show up in the last few sections of the book, like the book's editors ran out of gas right at the end.

I ended up having to hook up big speakers to my laptop to get decent enough sound.<br /><br />I researched bass guitar instruction books at several large book stores, and this was by far the best book available.  The only complaints I have are: 1) the \\"Dummies\\" title... I ended up making a book cover that included the fretboard/music notation pages from inside the book (a cheat sheet, if you will).  2) The introduction to music notation didn't include explanations of some obvious things, like what the bass clef symbol notation means(turns out to indicate which line corresponds to the note F), or what the time symbol \\"c\\" means (turns out to be common or 4/4 time, which is the time base used for most rock tunes)... I ended up going to Wikipedia to figure out the full details of music notation.<br /><br />Don't expect to read this book straight thru to learn the instrument... you have to take little samples from the different chapters, and put things together yourself sometimes... but, to be honest with you, I'm not really sure the approach used in this book can be improved on that much... it really is a pretty good book if you are willing to do some of your own research when you get curious about something that isn't fully covered in the book.	2005-02-27

My favorite was when the main character Mia found herself waiting in an impersonal public area:<br /><br />\\"... To be a stranger in an impersonal room in which there are other people who are not strangers to one another or to the place is to have a feeling of strangeness compounded\\".<br /><br />Extremely well done was the way that cultural bigotry is presented as embedded into the Ship's culture (whose residents call the Colonists \\"Mudeaters\\") and the Colonies (whose residents call the Shipdwellers \\"Grabbies\\")... I found myself asking, \\"where have I seen this good a presentation of this subject before?\\"... and it finally came to me - Asimov's Robot Murder Mystery Novels, and the bigotry of between Spacers and Earthmen.<br /><br />At first I wasn't enjoying the level of detail that was being presented when the \\"trainees\\" went down to a planet and constructed a shelter... but, by the time the chapter was over, I thought to myself; \\"dang - I learned how to build a log cabin!\\".	2005-02-25

War With Mexico, 18461848	Books	4	12	18	N	N	Good Overview	This title compares well to the handful of other War History Books I've read.<br /><br />Eisenhower does a good job of reviewing each significant battle in the right amount of detail, and the book provides decent maps and terrain descriptions (obvious musts).  He also does a good job of describing the involvement of the various Generals (from both sides), and lower-ranked officers who would later play signicant roles in the American Civil War that would follow a bit more than a decade from the end of this confict.<br /><br />Well done is the description of the psyche of the Mexican soldiers and populace, and the role it played in the course of the war.<br /><br />While there are some descriptions of the lives of the American enlisted men (who obviously far outnumber the officers), Eisenhower doesn't really make as much as an effort as could have been made in this area... I also felt he was a bit pompous when he would question why men would follow certain leaders (like John Fremont, for example).<br /><br />One area of the Mexican War, that any War History buff should not miss is the sub-story of the San Patricio (or St. Patrick's) Regiment of Irish \\"deserters\\" from the American side - which I first learned by reading this book...  Knowing this story (and being half-Irish myself), I sometimes will get too many beers under my belt in a TJ bar, and say in spanish that the Irish fought harder for Mexico than the Mexicans did (they were actually forced to), and it always draws crys of \\"No es Cierto!\\"  (It isn't True!)... and I say SI, ES CIERTO!	2005-02-24

However, in many ways John Grimes' universe is more diverse than James Kirk's, with stranger worlds and faster women.<br /><br />*** The Road to the Rim - Decent kick off to the series... Grimes is an Ensign, just out of the Federation Survey Service Academy.<br /><br />** To Prime the Pump - Not a boring read, but I found the final outcome to be too unbelievable... also, some of the predictions of technology from this story written in the very early 70's are somewhat feeble.<br /><br />***** The Hard Way Up - This is actually a collection of related short stories that was published in the late 60's/early 70's. Excellent reading, very entertaining.<br /><br />**** Spartan Planet - Grimes is now a Lt. Cmdr in the Survey Service, and his adventures continue in this well-written story about a seemingly all-male culture that has developed on this lost colony.<br /><br />***** The Inheritors - More top notch stuff... written in 1972, and the predicted technology doesn't seem as feeble as that from the earliest stories.

These stories, for the most part, were orignally written in the mid-1980's, and this collection itself was originally published in 1986.<br /><br />I found the Haviland Tuf main character to be so uniquely different from any other SciFi character I've ever encountered, that it was delightfully refreshing.<br /><br />Virtually all of the seven stories themselves are individually captivating; however, my favorite is the first from the collection, Plague Star.  Plague Star is by far the longest individual story of the seven, weighing in at over 100 pages (none of the others are much more than 50 pages).<br /><br />Another unique factor regarding this book are the illustrations; which I also found to be another refreshing difference versus the hundreds of other SciFi books I've read.  I'd say that there are over 40 illustrations, and in all but maybe two or three cases, I found them to add to the enjoyment of the stories.<br /><br />Another kudo goes to the jacket art for the book - extremely well done, and oddly, nothing like the illustrations found inside.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it seems that the author's other works are mostly fantasy-related, and that he produced nothing else quite like these stories - so I suppose I'm going to have to be content with this limited sample of uniquely enjoyable SciFi.	2005-02-17

I give it 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4.<br /><br />While the so-called \\"level of writing maturity\\" has improved over the course of the series, I still get a sense at times of the book being written for younger audiences... indeed, in this book, a group of young offspring of the main cast of characters from the 2nd book find themselves separated from their parents (and remaining known inhabited homeworlds of the Empire) by the main evildoer in the book.  They somehow manage to find themselves leading a group of rebels using technology they upgrade to about civil war era against a much larger force employing indigineous Napoleon-era technology.<br /><br />I'll also say that the love interests of the \\"good guys side\\" get a little sappy at times... and how come none of the \\"bad guys\\" have any love interests?<br /><br />Anyway, I'm surprised there hasn't been a followup to the series (the last book from the series was published in 1996), as there are some obvious loose ends that could have lead to at least one follow-on to the series (I guess the author wants to leave it at a \\"Trilogy\\").	2005-02-09

It is a fast-paced and fun read.<br /><br />It is an improvement in virtually every way versus the original book from the Trilogy - Mutineer's Moon, which was a decent offering itself.  It is larger, faster-paced, and has a less confusing presentation.  Especially improved is the \\"maturity level\\" of the writing style, which was a definate sore spot in the first book, but which still could stand some improvement here.  Another major advancement is in the area of Earth-bound politics - the first book was published in 1991, and still carried a lot of Cold War baggage, this book came out in 1994, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, so there are less political non-sequitors.<br /><br />Dahak's evolution into a sentient being is one of the highlights of the book... along with numerous and exciting battle scenes.  The Achuultani are interesting and worthy alien enemies, and many surprises await potential readers(I don't want to spoil the ending).<br /><br />Another point worth commenting on, this trilogy appears to offer enough material to form the basis for a television series, and possibly even a feature-length movie or two.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to getting started on the final and largest book from this trilogy - Heirs of Empire.	2005-01-25

Great punchline at the end of the next-to-last chapter.  Well thought out and believable space battle scenes.<br /><br />Having said that, there are some deficiencies that keep this book from acheiving  top-quality status:  1) Lack of action in the early-mid chapters.  2) Puppy character serves no pupose in this book - maybe he'll devlop into something in a follow-on book in this series.  3)  Some unbelievable coincendences - like when fleeing Stella and Toby find back door ajar on security zealot/spy Rafe's antique book cover business on remote planet's space station, and Rafe is old flame of Stella.  4) (Possible spoiler follows) The technological leap of having inter-solar ansible communication technology going from huge 100 man platforms into a few secret ship-based platforms is believable enough, but then we have the unbelievable leap in technology of an ansible turning out to exist as implant in Rafe's skull, and then being magically transferred to Ky's implant during \\"mind meld\\" - This ridiculous sequence is totally out of place in the book, and indeed serves no purpose in this particular book; it is an obvious lead in to a next book with Ky having this \\"super\\" capability... while this situation seriously detracts from the quality of this book, I'm even more afraid of what it could portend in future books from this series.	2005-01-12

But where does the water come from?  Does the author want us to believe that water runs uphill (as the river is shown on the map) from the other side of this ridge, on this small island?  And why do we still have rivers impossibly bisecting and trisecting most of the islands?  Look - I LOVE the maps, but sheesh, can we get the topography down just a little better next time?  Screw the original map's topography... chuck it out and redo the topography - someone with a good sense of topography could easily come up with some new island layouts that could even be able to fit within the context of the original two books - say by using tides induced by Bear to explain some of the rivers flowing uphill and bisecting New Florida - but Hammerhead needs to be \\"rethunk\\" and redrawn a bit, and all the other islands with bisecting/trisecting rivers (sometimes ocurring multiple times on a single island) have got to be redone to correct this impossible layout.<br /><br />The book ends up with an obvious opening to continued future stories for the characters - I just hope that a decent editor can be found, to correct the obvious and annoying errors that this author is prone to toss in among his otherwise great stories.o continued future stories for the characters - I just hope that a decent editor can be found, to correct the obvious and annoying errors that this author is prone to toss in among his otherwise great stories.	2005-01-03

Character development was also top notch.<br /><br />However, the book flops on at least three points - 1) The map of the world... while this could have been a great point, it falls flat on its face - how could there be so many rivers bisecting/trisecting entire continents? - ludicrous, really, as almost all of the many continents have this idiotic impossible feature, including the main river that the explorers venture out on.  2) The author evidently never heard of tacking a boat into the wind - unbelievable and annoying misunderstanding of a simple basic technological premise of exploration by sea... he has the explorers needing to cross the equator multiple times just to catch winds in a given direction.  3) Odd typographical and grammatical errors appear out of nowhere - did the author and editor's grammer checker go on the blink on random paragraphs?<br /><br />Yet, despite these huge flaws, the book has so many good points, it makes the book worth reading... indeed it is a fairly fun and quick read, if you just ignore the mistakes.  In fact, I'm moving on to the second book, and hope there aren't more annoying huge mistakes that I'll be forced to overlook.	2004-12-31

Moderately violent, but nothing unreasonable, given that the basis for the story is Sir Francis Drake's Privateering.  I'm looking forward to the next two stories in the trilogy.<br /><br />One minor criticism I have is that the author sometimes comes up with some ambigous and/or extremely tangled paragraphs, which require the reader to make multiple parses to untangle.  After awhile, I got used to it, and simply moved on when I came across a tangled paragraph.  In general, I noticed that it usually seemed to happen around the 3rd or 4th paragraph in every 4th or 5th chapter (the chapters average about 7 pages, which is nice).  Having said that, I'd like to point out that I don't remember finding any obvious typos or other minor screwups that can take away from the enjoyment of a story.<br /><br />Another minor criticism is the usage of the Mirror worlds... too impossible a gimmick in my opinion for stories that are supposed to be based on real events from the past - I'm actually hoping these worlds don't show up in the next two stories.	2004-11-08

Written about a post-apocalyptic world, it is basically three books in one, with each taking place about 500 years apart, and starting about 500 years after the near-destruction of mankind.<br /><br />Without giving anything away, the early Fallout Shelter encounter is fantastic, and a great start-off to this wonderful, quick-reading, and decent-sized book.  There are lots of interesting characters, and while not action-packed, there is always something interesting going on to keep you turning the pages to see what will happen next.<br /><br />Very impressed that the advanced spaceflight predicted by Miller in 1959 avoided the use of the dead planets Venus and Mars (many writers made the mistake, as late as the 60's, that there was life on these planets, or that they could be easily colonized).<br /><br />This book will not appeal to those not interested in reading some occasional passages in Latin (and even a few Hebrew phrases), or to those having an aversion to a book with a strong religious theme... Indeed, I think it exactly because of these two factors that the book has not become a popular classic.  Having said that, I wouldn't let the \\"religious content\\" bother open-minded individuals - I'm pretty much an agnostic (albiet right-leaning), and I find the introspections into the monks' Second Dark Age lives more than interesting in the context of the book.	2004-11-01

I've already bought the entire set of the 2nd Trilogy in hardback format (I got a good deal on SFBC), so I was kind of forced to finish this first book of first Trilogy in the two-Trilogy set.  It took me over a month to get thru it, and believe it or not, I started and finished at least three other books over that time period, so that kind of tells you something about how excited I was to plow thru it.  I've got to agree with the comments some other reviewers have made here, about it being an \\"ordeal\\", and that the main character second guesses himself too much, and that the aliens are too much like homo sapiens.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was a little disappointed with the overall quality of this book, and frankly I'm astonished by how many reveiwers here have been giving this book five stars.  I mainly read for fun, and I just didn't enjoy this book that much.<br /><br />Sure, there are some good parts...  The two pre-Cameron parts (on the station, and initial contact on the planet) were interesting enough, and the description of the old castle and the horse-like creatures were pretty good.<br /><br />But look, I've read hundreds of SciFi books, and there is no way this book deserves five stars.

Overnight, the opinion of the possibility of life on Mars went bankrupt:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Looking past that little idiosynchrocy, the book starts off interestingly-enough, but begins to bog down in the later parts; which, may I dare say, involve a lot of sex and religion (maybe these issues were shockers in 1962, but they are somewhat of a bore 40 years later).

Also, the whole premise of \\"The Plagued Queen\\" being \\"warned off\\", and the remaining unstriken crew doing \\"a job\\" on the asteroid station, then coming in undetected in the \\"burned off\\" area is more than a little far-fetched.<br /><br />These stories are very similar to the John Grimes tales that A.

In fact, one of the better Grimes stories \\"The Inheritors\\", is clearly based on the feline culture presented in the initial chapters of \\"The Plague Ship\\"... Also, a great many of the Grimes stories were based on the idea of \\"Lost Colonies\\", which is briefly but clearly outlined in \\"Sargasso of Space\\"...

This SFBC 50th Collection started out with a sample of 8 books from well-known SciFi authors that were published in 50's (Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke, Poul Anderson, Pohl, Simak, etc.), and I ended up liking City better than any of the other books from the 1st eight of the Collection.  The Collection has turned out to be popular enough, that another 8 significant SciFi books from the 60's were republished as part of the Collection (I found some real gems in that 2nd set), and now 8 more from the 70's are being republished.	2004-08-29

I'm a huge Asimov fan, and have read almost all of his SciFi work, and this book, while not a failure, has earned my lowest rating so far.	2004-08-27

There is one very memorable part, involving the small clone of Susie (one of Grime's ex-lovers).<br /><br />***** Matilda's Stepchildren - Top notch Grimes story - I have to say this is the best full-length book Chandler produced (some of the ones based on collections of short stories, previously published in SciFi mags are comparable - but this one manages to take top spot, for its consistancy).<br /><br />**** Star Loot - \\"Commodore Grimes\\" deals with arch-enemy Drongo Kane, and visits El Dorado again, longest Grimes story by far.<br /><br />*** Anarch Lords - Here is where I think Chandler is running out of gas, as many of the scenes and dialog seem to be repeats of previous stories.	2004-08-27

Bligh on a interstellar Bounty.<br /><br />***** The Far Traveller - Best of the four, it is a collection of short stories involving voyages on the AI-controlled ship \\"Far Traveller\\", owned by rich El Doradan lady who nags Grimes incessantly.  Far Traveller's AI is known as \\"Big Sister\\", who ends up falling for male-like AI on warlike alien spaceship, which leads to other complications.  Krarch!  Ends with Grimes given the gold-alloy \\"Little Sister\\" as payment for services rendered by El Doradan lady.<br /><br />***** Star Courier - An enjoyable yarn.  Grimes first voyage with gold-alloy \\"Little Sister\\".  Contracted to deliver mail with lady postmistress, they are captured by insect-like Shaara, eventually escape and battle Shaara with locals, who elevate them to gods.<br /><br />By 1977, Chandler has hit his stride with Grimes' tales... now I'm moving on to the next set of stories in John Grimes: Tramp Captain.	2004-08-27

US	47938431	R1JQPOLGHNTI4P	0061020060	777994859	Deepsix	Books	3	4	7	N	N	C++	This was the first McDevitt novel I read, and I must say that I enjoyed it at the time - and, if it wasn't for fact that I'm doing this review after having read the last 3 books (Deepsix, Chindi, Omega) out of  the \\"Hutch Series\\", I would have given it 4 stars.  However, after you've read more than one book from the series, there is just too much similarity between them to give any of them more than 3 stars.  The biggest complaint I've got are the appearance of multiple \\"last second cliffhangers\\" involving ropes and/or nets.  I can count at least five of these things - it gets a little annoying.  The books are pretty good otherwise, and if some other trick could be used instead of the ropes and nets, and last-second cliffhangers, it wouldn't be so bad... also, I'm starting to see why some of the folks have been complaining about the way the characters get killed of indiscriminantly - it wouldn't be so bad if it just happened in one book, but this is the pattern in all the Hutch novels, and you feel you are reading the same book all over again.  Sorry about the venting, but these books could have been so much more, if these \\"cons\\" could have been ommited for more original content.	2004-08-25

About the only thing that could be considered even closely related to this book is The End of Eternity.  No Robots, no Foundation, no Empire.  Its been quite awhile since I've read the book, and the person I lent it to never returned it, so I'll have to go off memory... but, the things I remember most about the book are: 1) The character who discovers the window into the other dimension - the kind of guy you love to hate; 2) The aliens from the other dimension - they are so bizarre, it is cool.	2004-08-25

The best part was the examination of \\"quality\\"; the breakdown of the romantic and classical viewpoints was brilliant.  I'm a motorcycle rider and sometimes tinkerer, so the motorcycle tinkering parts were fun too.  How the story of the ride, and the author's examination of his lost memories gets intertwined with the quality and motorcyle maintanance is totally cool... almost insane (but that's the whole point, right?).  This was a flash-in-the-pan effort - it is my understanding the author never acheived anything again like this hit.	2004-08-24

I hope the sequel keeps up the same quality as this one.  Only criticism I've got is the discription of \\"The Incessant California Sunshine\\", which shows up at least 3 times in the book (LA Galactic Station, Santa Monica, etc.) - anyone who has really lived near the coast in Southern California would know that we DON'T have a lot of sunshine at least 4-5 months out of the year (around Jan/Feb we get lots of RAIN, and in early summer we are always overcast - the so-called \\"June Gloom\\").  I kind of think it was pretty cool putting the LA Galactic Station at Camp Pendleton, but the buildings would be no more \\"bleached by the sun\\" than most places  (indeed probably less so than most American locales).	2004-08-16

Written in the mid-fifties, it still stands up well.  Very interesting main characters - Elijah and Daneel... it is a quick and fun read... of the hundreds of SciFi books I've read, I'd have to say that this is my favorite.  The followup book The Naked Sun, is also top-notch work.	2004-07-02

However, the sections on setting up a program so that you can build it for both the Desktop and the PockectPC environments have merit. But, as I recall, the implementation makes use of some kind of libraries found on the CD that comes with the book. Also, the implementation is for a C++ based programming environment, not a C#/CompactFramework environment - but the general approach should be the same. [...]	2004-01-10

But, in general, it is a BAD BOOK.  A number of Software Engineers at our facility have been making the jump to C++/MFC from a C-only background, and 85% of them think this book stinks.  I've started to read \\"Programming Windows with MFC\\", by Jeff Prosise, as I've heard it is a better book - and on first inspection, that seems true.  I admit, Visual C++/MFC is a complex topic... but this CAN'T be the way to teach it!  Think about it - why would Microsoft themselves allow so many other similar books on this subject to be printed, if this book was so good?  Part of the problem might be due to the fact that the original author died in a hang-glider accident before the last edition was published; and the two new guys who were handed his work just patched it together the best they could to meet a publishing deadline... but this can't explain it all... with this book, there is a consistent lack of coherent approach to teaching the subject... it is simply a hodgepodge of different topics, each with an example - but with no overall coherence....  I've got to think that the people who are giving it good reviews either a) Work for Microsoft, or b) don't REALLY program real applications ...I suppose what more can we expect given the current situation with one company having a virtual monopoly on the C++/Windows application development industry(the WHOLE computer industry, for that matter) - we HAVE to take their garbage... we have no other choice.  Boy - I long for the days when Microsoft DID produce decent books on how to program their systems... the Petzold books were FANTASTIC... nothing like this cacaphony.  Too bad Java hasn't really caught on... at least the Deitel books were good in that arena.  I see where the Deitels are producing a C# Visual Studio.NET book(currently held for publishing pending Microsoft's release of .NET).  The Deitel books are EXCELLENT... if you're considering learning this subject at this juncture, I'd wait for the Deitel book, if at all possible, as it will include this subject matter, but synced-up with Microsoft's latest development environment.  BTW, many professors SWEAR by the Deitel books - they are simply excellent, nothing like this rubbish.juncture, I'd wait for the Deitel book, if at all possible, as it will include this subject matter, but synced-up with Microsoft's latest development environment.
