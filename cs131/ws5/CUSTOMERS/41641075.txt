US	41641075	RFW7302YHURL1	0312169582	418307716	The Ordained	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Good read, ending a bit disappointing.	People are mysteriously disappearing in the small town of Rapture, Indiana. Rumour has it that it is an act of God, sending the faithful to heaven and leaving the sinners back on Earth, or maybe it's alien abductions? Whatever it is, Owen Keane is on the case to find out what is causing the disappearances and what it has to do with a man he helped convict years before.<br />This is my first Owen Keane novel, but I found I didn't need to have read the 5 previous Keane novels to know and understand the character. It's very well written and has great elements of mystery. Characterisation was great, and greatly enhanced the misleading factor of the guilty parties for this mystery. The only disappointing aspect was the ending, which seemed a bit too contrived and 'Hardy Boyish' for my liking.<br />Overall, it was a very satisfying read. RECOMMENDED!!!	2003-04-13

Following the quake in Gotham City, the US congress has decided that it would take too much money to rebuild Gotham so they shut it off from the mainland and declared it a No Man's Land. Those that had nowhere else to go, criminals and the released Arkham Asylum prisoners are all that's left. It's up to Batman and co. help keep the peace.<br />The story is told in different points of view through either Batman, The Huntress, Barbara Gordon, Commissioner Gordon relating events that are occurring to them at the time making the character portrayal better than any comic can give, where their thoughts, fears and despair are all noted in detail and help add to humanise the characters from the two-dimensional characters we've seen in the past. The Batman being the most interesting, having being victim of destruction and adaption throughout his whole life, with the death of his parents, death of Jason Todd (Robin II), having his back broken by Bane, both cases of the Clench disease and now finally the destruction of his beloved city, we see him have to try and change his whole attitude to survival, fighting crime and guardianship over his colleagues just to survive in this new destroyed Gotham.<br />If you're a follower of the comic series, you'll find that not all the NML adventures were able to put into print. i.e. there are no mention of little known players like Azrael. But this does not lessen the novelised version of the NML story in anyway.<br />So, if you feel you need a change from the comic adventures of the Batman or you feel like reliving and adventure of a childhood hero, you'll find that you cant go wrong by reading this book. RECOMMENDED for a fantastic read!	2003-04-13

Visiting a friend in Hollywood, Los Angeles, 1947 the Doctor, along with Ben and Polly,  discover that the multi-millionaire movie producer has been murdered. Working with the LAPD, the Doctor and co. soon discover the murder is related to a soon-to-be-released movie, which is either the greatest movie of all time or something more sinister.<br />The novel reads, especially scenes with Detective William Fletcher and Hitman Robert Chate, like an early pulp crime novel reminiscent of author Raymond Chandler novels. These secondary characters shine as the most interesting characters in the book.<BR>Throughout the beginning of the novel, the Doctor's character doesn't seem to fit in with his surroundings and seems to act a bit more overly-polite than usual, it's not until you're about a third way into the novel that this unsurity about the Doctor's character settles down to something we're all familiar with. It's also good to see Ben and especially Polly get some 'screen' time in the book too.<br />Overall , a great fun read, with an element of something different. RECOMMENDED!!!!	2003-02-17

When Melanie Conway receives a psychic premonition of her father's death, she and her boyfriend Brodie get caught up in events that could kill the both of them. Meanwhile Mel's sister Penelope has been receiving gruesome prank phone calls that has her on the edge of madness and paranoia are these two events related? If so, who is the perpetraitor?<br />Like all other Laymon novels, this is also has a very easy to read flow and is hard to put down. Not as gory as a lot of his other novels but still has the same amount of sexual moments to help add to the tension of the story. It's great in identifying how paranoia can lead to beliefs on the verge of madness, becoming reality.<br />On the downside, the second flow of the story with the prank phone calls seems like a bit of a cop-out when all is revealed who is doing it. <br />All up, it's a short novel well worth the read, if only for the ending chapter.	2003-01-01

The TARDIS and crew arrive on the planet Hitchemus, where a human colony that shares a passion for music, share the world with its only other dominant life forms - harmless friendly creatures that closely resemble Earth tigers. Weather conditions and the peaceful tranquility of the world make it a near paradise to live in...but that's all about to change!<br />I found that the novel starts off with a leisurely pace, but being quite slow and not really catching the reader with much interest and you're left hoping that it will get better. But, once the plot kicks into gear you'll find yourself engrossed and hard-put to put the book down with it's many twists and developments in both the planet's inhabitants, the Doctor's and his companions lives.<br />Orman's characterisation is superb. Especially with the creation of the 'tiger' society being vastly more interesting than the 'run of the mill' human society it must go up against. The Doctor's actions do come as a surprise, but isn't uncharacteristic - the ending being the best and will leave you thinking \\"It's about time you done that, Doc\\" (No pun intended).<BR>Anji's character is tested and is starting to really evolve as she must decide where her loyalties lie with the colonists or the Doctor, who has gone and abandoned them. Fitz is clearly running scared but his rock-hard faith in the Doctor is also great to see. Plus, the fun loving, innocent tiger 'Bounce' is a character you'll easily find yourself enjoying immensely.<br />I found that the story does seem to resemble a 'mish mash' of different themes from the televised stories of the Doctor, with \\"The Silurians\\" being one of the main.<br />Overall, as with all Kate Orman books, you will find this an enjoyable experience, and a great and refreshing break from the previous 8th Doctor novels preceding it. VERY RECOMMENDED!!!	2002-11-25

The TARDIS lands the Doctor and Leela in the middle of a forest due to a time distortion affect. In the search to uncover what is going on, they must deal with murder, dangerous university experiments regarding ESP, annoying students and dodgy water.<br />From the outset you can tell this isn't going to be one of the greatest WHO novels around as it introduces us to a bunch of 5 university students who has a love/hate comedy routine that, at the beginning was quite fun, but when it continues on until the end of the novel with every scene including them, becomes very annoying and monotonous.<br />Character development in practically nil except for the two main characters of the Doctor and Leela. The Doctor is acting a bit (not much though) more quirky than usual (due to the effects of the time distortion thingy) and doesn't really do anything proactive for the first 2/3's of the novel. Leela is the most interesting character in the novel, as in the other Boucher books, you get to see what is going on in the warrior's mind and her ways of thinking and trying to break free of her 'primitive' reasoning's. Something the tv series would find hard to do. (Unless they had her talking to herself which would look stupid).<br />The book did have potential with it's 'hauntings' and 'other realms' aspects, which were kind of creepy but s essentially let down by the discovery of who/what is responsible at the end. The ending is also a huge let down - the whole story builds up to it's height and is then over in just 2 quick short, mildly confusing pages. (Maybe he was late for his deadline or something?)<br />I would recommend this as a no brainer, no stress read, but be prepared to be disappointed.	2002-11-12

The TARDIS has been split apart stranding Benny is early 20th Century London, Ace on a barren world in the distant future, and the Doctor gone. Whilst trying to work out has happen to the TARDIS (and the Doctor) Benny must deal with grisly murders that make the Jack the Rippers murders pale in comparison and Ace must lead a group of human guerillas against a race of alien, um, bugs.<br />What better way to flesh out character relationship than to thrust them into an adventure involving just the both of them, (Newer companion Benny and hardened war soldier Ace) without the focal point of the novel (The Doctor) to get in thier way. The most important part of this relationship is Benny seeing Ace's point of view regarding the Doctor's meddling and using her as a pawn in on of his games.<br />Benny's part throughout the novel is by far the better, with her off-the-cuff very likeable type of manner and the eerie 1909 setting of London streets , whereas Ace's character is still continuing the very unlikeable, bitter, untrusting person since she rejoined the team 3 stories ago.<br />Another good point is the introduction of the hermit, Muldwych, who seems to play another part of the Doctor's little known history. (Frustratingly, as in accordance to other novels that deal with the history of The Doctor, you're left in Wonderland Limbo again)<br />Most importantly, being a companion novel to ICEBERG (where you find out where the Doctor has been) doesn't mean you will have to read ICEBERG to enjoy and understand what goes on in BIRTHRIGHT.

The Doctor, Fitz and new companion, Anji Kapoor arrive on a world that honours the  planet Earth by showcasing time periods in a fun park manner. Whilst getting lost on the world all three must deal with dangerous dinosaurs, Killer robots, homicidal triplets, talking Sphinx and Elvis impersonators before they can work out what exactly is going on.<br />Jacqueline Rayner's first foray in to the BBC Doctor Who novels is brilliant.  What better way to have Anji's first real adventure than to throw her into a really bizarre situation to flesh out what her character will be like..<br />Alongside Anji trying to come to terms with the loss of her boyfriend, Dave (Escape Velocity), and trying to deal with this bizarre new life she has with the Doctor, Fitz also must come to terms with the knowledge that he is not the original Fitz Kreiner, only a `remembered' copy. Plus the Doctor is once again showing that he is not the man he was by acting in a more violent manner.<br />Overall, a great break in the serious books preceding it, very funny moments with great character development.

Journalist, Grant Markham, is seeking immortality through fame by tracking down the missing scientist, Michael Drake, who has developed an antidote for a disease that is currently ravishing the universe and hasn't been seen for over 15 years. Taking a huge party of humans and Orange-eyes, they traverse the dangers of the planet Bushveld to see if the doctor still lives.<br />I found that the book has pretty much no character development whatsoever, except for the main antagonist, Grant Markham. He was the arrogant, rogue, gets everything he wants, killer journalist but you tend to find yourself liking him as he was the only one you knew anything about. All other characters are just one dimensional, they did have possibilities to become greatly remembered characters, but in the end were just a let down.<br />The planet Bushveld was a great place and well described with it's jungle/native settings. Alien types were good as well. The story tended to jump from days to weeks making it a very quick little jaunt that actually went for about a year. And although this is just a reinterpretation of the Stanley/Livingstone affair, only in space. There's really not much change in the story other than place/race/character names.<br />Overall, an entertaining, short read, with a bit of a shocking ending, but with a lot of dull characters and events and leaves you with the notion that it could have been so much better.	2002-09-15

The Doctor, Anji and Fitz land in the English village of Marpling in the 1930's. here they discover strange deaths occurring due to wasp attacks. Alongside this is the crack commando team from the future plus the man who houses the wasps in his body.<br />Characterisation of all characters is excellent, especially Anji, who is finally coming to terms with who the Doctor is, what he does and the ever present danger everywhere he goes. Plus a mention for the characterisation of Mr. Rigby (the wasp eater) is superb, with the gradual take-over of his body as well as mind portayed wonderfully. <br />The sleepy village setting is perfect for the story and I find has always worked well with Doctor Who, especially with the town gossip that everyone can relate to, Mrs Havers. Trevor Baxendale must have a thing for `creepy crawlies' as this is the third Dr Who novel featuring them - the first two being Giant Spiders then giant slugs, now killer wasps. - cant wait for the next bug. Also a hint maybe of the outcome of what is happening in the universe following the destruction of Gallifrey and the Time Lords.<br />Overall, an excellently pace, high action Doctor Who monster story to enjoy.

She must escape the prison, island, battle all sorts of monsters and stop the insane genius behind the island before she can get on with the search for Chris again.<br />Not having played the computer game, I cant say how true to the game the book is, but, the tone of the book continues the eerie, bleak, hopelessness of the other books. Parts of the book imbue the feeling you would get when playing the actual game. <BR>Alongside the introduction of a new monster the novel also sees the return of a character from the first Resident Evil, one who by all right should be dead, and interesting developments regarding the Umbrella Spy, Trent are revealed.<br />Overall, another chilling gem in the Resident Evil series, RECOMMENDED!	2002-09-09

Following a time anomaly, the TARDIS takes the Doctor to the home of former companion Nyssa who was researching the life of Roger Bacon, but for some reason has now never heard of him. The Doctor then travels back to the source of this anomaly to Oxford 1278 AD - not wanting to take Nyssa with him as she is Nyssa from the future of whom he has yet to meet - unfortunately she stows away on the TARDIS. The Doctor is soon involved in a murder mystery involving the Franciscan brotherhood friary.<br />Although it was a great idea to have a return of Nyssa meeting the Doctor before she had originally met him - it seems that it was done just to catch he audiences eyes. She does not take part in the main story of the novel and pretty much is depressed and possibly suicidal throughout the whole book - not really the way we'd like to remember Nyssa, I'm sure.<br />The murder investigation, teaming the Doctor up with one of the Friars, Alfric is quite entertaining (although you will guess who the murderer is pretty much straight away), but this aspect of the novel is very short. The Doctor's mannerisms are quite good, as are all the secondary characters - especially Alfric, but Nyssa is a shame.<br />Overall, this is a good little murder mystery but does contain a lot of padding, which it did need as it would have only run to about 100 pages in length. Plus it has helped tarnish an image of a popular companion - that's bad!!! GRRR!!!!	2002-08-21

While investigating a horrific example of sabotage on the new cruise liner, the  `Emerald Dolphin', Dirk Pitt is once again drawn into a chain of events that has him rescuing the crew of a shipping disaster worse than Titanic, aerial dogfights, sinking submarines, beautiful women and two lost legends of Captain Nemo and a missing Viking expedition.<br />The book is action packed, with Pitt overcoming the near impossible to solve the case and to help his friends. Cussler's fantastic writing ability shines through once again, with his detailed descriptions of all things mechanical (e.g. ships, cars, planes, etc) to his geographical and diving expertise. Characterisation is perfect and it's great to see it reflected that Dirk and friends are aging unlike a lot of other `heroes' of novels who tend not to. The two prologues of the novel are also very well written and could have possibly been two separate novels in themselves if expanded upon.<br />I found myself becoming a bit `overwhelmed' with the novel towards the third part due to the fact that I was bombarded with near impossible action sequence after another. Although all sequences are fantastic. Another sequence I'm sure every reader will find amusing, is the certain cameo appearance of someone I wont name as it'll spoil the fun. The ending also doesn't have any bearing on the current storyline, so here's hoping another Dirk Pitt adventure is coming along soon.<br />Overall, another fantastic Pitt novel from Cussler. One of the best action, adventure writers out there. RECOMMENDED!!!	2002-08-07

The television series `Buffy The Vampire Slayer' has seen nearly every type of monster you will ever find. This book details all the leading ones seen up to the end of series 4 of the program. Divided into appropriate monster sections - Demons, Vampires, Magic Users, Primals, Ghosts, The Walking Dead, Bogeymen, Invisible People, and Faith and The Human Monster, it details every character with who they are, when they appeared, where they are now, unique attributes, etc.<br />This is just not a book based on Buffy though, alongside the Buffy Monster descriptions are a incredibly well researched history of each type of monster alongside nearly every mention of them within movies, comics and literature. As a bonus also, there are 16 colour pages with publicity shots, make up shots and scenes from the series on them.<br />Overall, this book is not only a guide to Monsters in the Buffyverse, but all mainstream monsters in general.

A dead mans will enlists the aid of the Frank and Joe Hardy along with their Detective Father, Fenton to find a person who's only description is 'The Aztec Warrior'. The case takes the boys, along with their best pal, Chet, to Mexico. Among the ruinded temples and ancient pyramids, they find themselves against a group of people who will do 'anything' to get to this Aztec Warrior before they do.<br />This is the least enjoyable Hardy Boy book I have read so far. Their detective skills in the book relies solely on pure luck and coincidence with not much, if any, detective work being done by the duo. Action sequences are all a let down. A chapter will end with a Bull bearing down at them giving the boys no escape. This will all be resolved in the next chapter within one very small paragraph saying that it suddenly turned down a side street. This is what I call 'A COP OUT!!!\\". A majority of all the exciting parts of the novel end this way making the novel a very frustrating read. I would recommend this only to Hardy Boy completists out there.	2002-08-07

But the Doctor isn't quite the man Fitz used to know. Searching for Anji Kapoor's kidnapped boyfriend the Doctor And Fitz soon find themselves caught up in a struggle between two rivals to be the first privately funded man in space.<br />Being the last in the `Stranded on Earth' story arc sees a fun, classic story like the ones before the arc had begun. Fitz is back, hours after the eventful happenings on the now non-existant Gallifrey. The TARDIS has returned. A new companion has come aboard and best of all, the Doctor is his old self again (well kind of, he still lacks a lot of his memory and has a tendency to end a situation with more violence than usual.)<br />A strange part of the novel is the inclusion of the American version of UNIT, they do play a part but have no bearing whatsoever on the story. The ending is great, ending it with the same feeling ,story that continues into the next story (like with the classic 1st Doctor televised stories) and makes this a great starting point for new Doctor Who readers.

A band of punk rockers and their filthy cattle truck has started a convoy across the South west of England gathering loyal followers in their wake of destruction and murder everywhere they play. With Jo having succumbed to the malevolent pull of hatred from the band and the Doctor lost in some limbo void, it looks like its up to UNIT to solve the problem the way the Brigadier likes to, with all guns ablazing.<br />You'll find that RAGs is a very different style of Doctor Who, written with a huge amount of horror elements along with very visual violent scenes. This horror element fits in perfectly with the time it is set in, the English countryside atmosphere helping make the tone perfect and feels like it is a JAMES HERBERT novel.<br />You'll also notice that the Doctor, although he does play a big part in the finale, isn't really around much throughout the novel. He is either procrastinating about whether to do something proactive about this convoy or he is lost in some mind controlled void. Although the author does recognise this in the book, it does seem the Doctor was only a background character. Although the mind trip does involve some of the Doctor's subconscious doubts about himself, which are always good. This book could have easily been written without being placed in the Doctor Who universe at all.<br />Characterisation is excellent for the Doctor, Jo and all the regulars of UNIT with Mike Yates shining through again as he tends to with novelisations he is in (as opposed to the sorry git he is portrayed on TV.)<br />Overall, this is a good British horror book that just happens to involve the Doctor.

You will find Michael Lark's artwork to be a little rough and dark but you will soon get drawn in and find that it does fit in superbly with the noir/pulp styling of the novel. As this is based on a novel you will find that the story revolves around the writing so don't expect any action sequences, but this will make the experience of  `The Little Sister' better, longer and more memorable, especially the sarcastic comments from detective Philip Marlowe, who is a likeable ...P>Recommended for a change from the overwhelming superhero graphic novels, this classy detective thriller will satisfy you with both is storytelling and artwork.	2002-07-31

The Doctor and new companion Romana have only just found the first segment to the 'Key To Time' when they come across a situation that could destroy the whole universe. The Doctor is conflicted with what to do, continue gathering the segments of the Key to Time and avert a galactic disaster or stay and help prevent the rising of 'Valdemar' to prevent another galactic disaster.<br />Being placed after the first story of the Key To Time season, 'The Ribos Operation', see the Doctor and Romana's relationship at edge. The Doctor not wanting a companion and Romana innocent to the wonders and threats of the galaxy. The Doctor's grumbling conversations with himself regarding this fact are quite humourous and fits well with the televised period this story is set in. Romana is also excellently portrayed as the 'newbie' traveller. K-9 is put out of action, therefore hardly appears in the novel at all.<br />The story is narrated in a third person view, you will find it is a bit distracting at first but you will understand (well kind of) at the end of the novel why this was done - so keep at it.<BR>The plot is also quite busy, with lots of things happening at once which again can become confusing with keeping up with the events. You might have to read over passages to work out what is going on.<br />Overall, it's a good story with great characterisation, but you may need to force yourself to continue reading it - it's worth it if you do.	2002-07-24

After being trapped on Earth with no memory of his past for 80 plus years, the Doctor has finally gotten himself a family. His daughter, Miranda, also has two hearts and a high intelligence. After her 'parents' are killed in an Galactic attempt to take her life, the Doctor takes on the role as a foster parent.<br />Set over 3 periods, the Early, Mid and Late 80's, Parkin has used a lot of media merchandising references to help date these periods - most notably the mega huge 'Batman' franchising of the late 80's. The story of why Miranda is the target for death also lends us to believe that following Gallifrey's demise in 'The Ancestor Cell', the universe has also radically changed through no one controlling time travel for other races.<br />The only disappointing aspect is the uncharacteristic ending of the novel, but the excitement and reality of the rest of the book fars outweighs this slight inconsistency. Here's hoping there is another book (again by Parkins) that sees a continuation with the Doctors and Miranda's relationship.<br />Definately the best in the 'Earth Arc' series.

You will find that the book does not answer any previous questions you had about the movie, it just adds a heap more (plus it makes the storyline of the movie sequel 'Book Of Shadows' even worse). Recommended for a chilling read!!!	2002-07-11

Nobody thinks anything of it until sudden outbreaks of insanity occur following the path of the Fog.Insanity that drives both man and animal to act out of ordinary, commit mass suicide and even kill. There is only one man immune to the Fog's touch, so he has to find out what the Fog is before it comes to the heavily populated city of London.<br />A great Horror/Thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for more and more of the gruesome effects of the Fog. Written in 1975, the gruesome factor would have been 'over the top', not so much these days but it still packs a punch.<br />Characterisation is excellent, especially his secondary characters which he will build up then kill off with a blood-gurgling finish. The writing is also very visual with no confusion about what is going on. The setting in cold, foggy England really helps with the forboding chilling feeling you get with this book as well. James Herbert is up there as being one of the top Horror writers along with Stephen King and Richard Laymon. Very enjoyable. RECOMMENDED TO ALL!	2002-07-10

The 4th in the 'Stuck on Earth with no memory' story arc sees the Doctor fed up with others problems and just wanting to be left alone. After the death of a friend, who leaves him with secret documents concerning a myterious third player in the Cold War era bent on destroying the world, The Doctor (after much blackmailing) is forced to save the world again.<br />This novel reads like an action spy thriller, with the Doctor amazing everyone with his fighting prowess, his 'vulcan' neck pinch and his short hair.<br />It also see the return of 'The Players' from their self-titled book also by Dicks. If you're not familiar with these characters, escpecially the motivation for the Countess, you will feel very underwhelmed towards the end of the novel. Actually, I knew about them and was still underwhelmed. I'm thinking this might mean another excursion into the 'Players' at a later date.<br />A distracting point in the novel, comes around page 177 where it seems the editing crew must have been sleeping as one of the main villian's name keeps alternating from Myrek to Marek. A small mistake but it does break the flow of the story.<br />I recommend this book, but only for a different kind of Doctor Who story which would have been better off without the 'Players' involved.	2002-07-07

Something strange is going on in the small village of Culverton when a convoy of trucks and black shirted troops appear and take over a Second World War aerodrome. People are going missing and there is something terrifying in the swamp.<br />Mark Gatiss has once again brought us to a quaint small village to create (as he did in Nightshade) a spooky, creepy feel to his novel. The story is set after the 3rd Doctors exile on Earth has been lifted. This has enabled the writer to begin the Doctor's adventures by finishing off a solo jaunt on another planet.<br />The book is a very light/fun read, great for an escape from the harder, multiple plotline Doctor Who novels. It features great representation of the Doctor, Jo Grant, the Brigadier and the rest of UNIT plus the surprise villian. You will find scenes remeniscent from ALIEN to THE LIVING DEAD movies here all adding to the enjoyment to this traditional era novel. RECOMMENDED to all!!!!	2002-06-23

Stephen King is one of the worlds most recognised authors of the 20th/21st century. 'On Writing' is King sharing with you some of the memorable moments of his life which would eventually lead him to pen the vast amounts of best-sellers he has. Also sharing 'tips' in writing style that could help make you a better writer. Ending with an account of his accident which nearly killed him.<br />Set out in three parts. The first deals with Kings past with memoirs from his childhood right up to his current life. You will find this part extrememly hilarious. King's sense of humour shines through making you totally enrapt in his life adventures.<br />The second part, 'On Writing', deals with how the reader should go about writing a story/novel. This is very interesting even if you're not planning on doing any writing, but for any budding writers it should be thought of as some sort of secret bible. Everything he tells you is in a conversational and humourous tone and does not come across like a boring text-book.<br />The third part deals with his accident and his amazing recovery. He sounds a bit bitter about this - I wonder why?<br />This book is recommended, not only to budding writers, but to everyone. It will instill hope into you alongside an incredibly entertaining read. Best read in a long time!!!!	2002-06-20

In mid-flight, the Doctor receives a telepathic dream message from a long lost friend, begging for help. The friend was overtaken by the cosmic force known as the Celestial Toymaker. The Doctor goes looking for revenge and, along with his companions, end up once again playing the Toymakers deadly games.<br />This novel is really two interlinking stories in one. In the second part of the book we go back into the Doctors past to when he was still in school on Gallifrey and visit an adventure he had with his first ever TARDIS jaunt which leads him to his first Toymaker meeting. This is by far the best aspect of the novel and it would be great to get another story set around this period. The fifth Doctor's parts tend to be pretty bland.<br />The Toymakers games that try to persuade the Doctor's companions to doubt him are excellent and are issues that were not ever touched on in the series. <br />But one of the best reasons to read this book is for all the Adric bashing - yay!! He whinges a lot but he does get put back into place. All in all, the book is RECOMMENDED for a no brainer read and especially for the insight into the Doctor's past.	2002-06-13

The society where the crew members from the Sandminer from the televised story 'Robots Of Death' originate from. The incident on the sandminer concerning Taren Capel and his killer robots has been hushed up with the survivors suffering mental breakdowns. This time someone has instructed the Robots to kill again, the whole city of Kaldor is their playground, and this time they look human.<br />Chris Boucher obviously wanted Leela portrayed more as a warrior than the stupid savage that was televised. This novel, as in Chris's previous novel 'Last Man Running', has Leela kicking, slashing, stalking and protecting as her warrior code kicks into overdrive making the scenes with her fantastic. No more stupid Leela - yay!!<br />The book has a fast, exciting pace that continues all the way through. But I think it helps a lot if you are familiar with the characters and the scenario from 'The Robots Of Death'. The Doctor tends to go a bit overboard with his humour but still remains in the boundary of his character. There is also a character , Con the Flierman, who will have you in stitches and would have been great to see again (unfortunately circumstances do not permit this).<br />On the down side, the novel is extremely anti-climatic. Everything is running along at a fast pace, then BAM, the shows over, thanks for coming. The ending is very quick and confusing, maybe Boucher has a certain page limit he can submit and he over wrote it and had to squeeze it all in at the end. Or maybe it was meant to continue in his 'Kaldor City' audio series from BBV. WHO knows!!! (hahah bad joke)	2002-06-12

Bayport is suffering a water shortage due to water from a newly constructed reservoir mysteriously disappearing at night. Deciding to take on this 'mystery' for a bit of fun, Frank and Joe Hardy along with their best friend Chet, soon find themselves the target of a sequence of deadly attacks to get them off the case.<br />You might find the writing style of the book a bit dated due to the age of the novel, but you will soon get 'sucked in' to the story disregarding the 'cornyness' of the style. It follows the basic layout of a Hardy Boy story, the most noticable being the case they are working on has something to do with the case their famous detective father, Fenton Hardy, is also working on in Chicago. Great for young readers and nostalgic value. RECOMMENDED TO ALL!!!	2002-06-05

A distress signal is sent to the TARDIS, sending Kamelion into spasms and Turlough into a frenzy trying to hide this signal, of which he has recognised from his past. Kamelion, unbeknownst to the Doctor, sets coordinates for the signal which originates from Earth. This sets in motion distrust between the crew, with at least one of them having to leave, another is gained and the return of a favourite villian.<br />This novel is Turlough's swan song, as you learn more about his character than in any previous story. The novel gives more of a portrayal of the angry youth than the televised version ever did. Here you see Turlough forcibly threaten the life of the companion robot Kamelion, just to keep his secret safe. <br />You'll also find the introduction of the young well endowed  American botanist, Perpegilliam Brown (Peri). Sure she whines a lot but she ends up being one of the better companions.<BR>This story also sees the departure of the very little used Kamelion, which is great as he never done much for the series. Plus the shockingly 'small' misfortunes of one of the Doctor's greatest adversaries.<br />The ending is a surprise departure of three supporting cast members, one being totally ruined by a future story. This story is RECOMMENDED to all.	2002-05-30

The TARDIS arrives in Oxley Woods where a forcibly regenerated Doctor collapses outside of it. This occurs during a strange meteor shower in the area at the same time, which has UNIT investigating. The shower turns out to be an invasion force from the Autons, Mannequin looking aliens made of plastic.<br />This was the novelisation of the first Pertwee story called 'Spearhead From Space'. Terrance Dicks has done a great job in adapting the story even adding the ending of the previous story 'The War Games' at the start so you know the Doctor is going through a regeneration. The pictures in the book are ok but still pretty dodgy - the Autons look nothing like Autons. The end scene fighting the Nestene Consciousness is much better than the televised version as it did not have to rely on cheap rubbery unconvincing props to help get it by and does seem to be an actual squid-like monstrosity they are fighting. RECOMMENDED!!!	2002-05-19

They need to find the cause of the power drain before anyone can leave as well as deal with the locals. Then the DALEKS arrive.<br />The book is a great adaptation of the tv serial. It follows the plot line perfectly, even adding to it through explaining the trials, in more detail than the tv serial, the city makes the Doctor and Bellal undergo. Recommended!!!	2002-05-19

Always being frightened and humiliated in front of everyone. To show that she's not the 'scaredy cat' of the school, she is determined to get the scariest halloween mask she can find. The thing is, she got one too scary...<br />Excellent book for early teens, with readers able to sympathise with Carly's teasing and embarrassing moments. Also Stine portrays a very claustrophobic feeling when you find out that the mask won't come off. RECOMMENDED for all young people who like creepy stories.	2002-05-17

They encounter an ark full of dead bodies and soon find themselves caught up in a Cyberman plot to destroy the 'planet of gold', Voga.<br />Being an adaptation of the serial, the book is exactly the same. Two annoying inconsistencies are the Cybermen using guns in the book whereas the tv serial had their guns inbuilt into their heads and the other is the portrayal of the Cybermats as the small silverfish looking Cyber killers (as seen in The Wheel In Space and Tomb of the Cybermen), whereas in the serial they look like metal eels.<br />I would recommend watching the video rather than reading this book, you will get more out of it.	2002-05-17

Just before the cameras start rolling, she has one of her 'mind-splitting, heavens sent' headache messages given to her from 'The Powers That Be'. Unable to leave the premises or call anyone, she must try to convey her message to her teammates through the cameras. Headaches aside, she must also decide whether the ghostly goings on in the house are staged or the real thing.<BR>Meanwhile Angel and co, as well as looking into Cordy's problem, are investigating a Jane Doe body found with demonic markings on her. Everything leads to Wolfram & Hart.<BR>This book reads just like a movie length episode would be like. Characterisation is spot on. You see the difficulties between Angel and his partners after the Darla events, Angels feelings for Cordy are more apparent, the interchange between Gunn and Wesley is hilarious, the relationship between Gunn and his gang is getting tenser plus an insight into why police tend not to deal with the supernatural related cases that occur in LA. Oh yeah, a small cameo from Doyle as well, YAY!<BR>Overall, this book is RECOMMENDED to everyone!!!	2002-04-29

'The Final Sanction' see the return of the vicious armoured shark-like aliens - the Selachians from a previous Lyons book 'The Murder Game'. The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe arrive during the end of the war between humans and Selachians. They are immediatly caught up with the fighting when Zoe is captured by the Selachians and taken back to their home planet, which is destined to be destroyed in the war. The Doctor must risk either saving Zoe and altering the history of Time or letting Time run its course.<br />Steve tries to convey the message that the Selachians aren't the violent creatures they make themselves out to be giving a detailed history of why they are like they are. But this feeling of pity is soon dropped as the Selachians shoot plasma rifles into the bellies of prisoners, rips their arms off, etc. <br />Characterisation of the Doctor and Jamie are pretty much spot on whereas Zoe tends to be a bit more 'gung-ho' as usual, which is  a nice change as opposed to her usual cerebral damsel in distress mode.<br />The story is a gritty space-war story so dont expect much light-heartedness.

Their peace is soon shattered as a series of vicious attacks on underwater divers and ships occur which leads to an almost unstoppable attack onto the colony itself.

Now imagine it as five vans drive through it shooting it to pieces in a total violent bloodfest. This is how the terror on Poplar Street begins for the many residents of this unfortunate street. The story is told in a real time situation with the events of the residents of Poplar street and past events through diary/letter entries which lead up to the reason behind the terror. The only trouble I had with this book was remembering the number of characters that live on the street. But Bachman provides a quick remedy for this by killing a lot of them off through the most violent of means. Not one for the queasy as there is a lot of blood, gore and brain-matter in the majority of death scenes. RECOMMENDED TO ALL!!!	2002-04-09

The Doctor, travelling alone, has decided to visit his old friend Harry Sullivan but is again caught up in the machinations of the Voractylls (from the New Adventure System Shock) during the turn of the Millennium. One good thing about the novel is the fact that even though it took place on British soil - there were no involvement from UNIT, just the regular Army. Characterisation is excellent, you'll find yourself laughing at the wordplay between the Doctor and Harry which is reminiscent from their time on the show. If it wasn't for the fact this was a Doctor Who novel you would think this a novel by Clive Cussler or Tom Clancy. Packed full of action, well written. RECOMMENDED!!!!	2002-04-02

The subject matter is about two rival gangs of the 60's, the Mods and Rockers, taken to `the future' by an alien race where they wage a war on each other that keeps going on and on and on. The `future' environment they are in consists of buildings and robots and weapons you would expect to find in a 60's comic magazine. I'm thinking that the tone and subject matter of this novel would have fit better with a 2nd Doctor adventure rather than an 8th Doctor one. The characterisation of the Doctor and Fitz are great though and Compassion is hardly even in the book. But of all the other characters - they are just really annoying and frustrating. The book is still worth a read - but don't expect much from it.	2002-04-02

They are thrust into a situation involving an experiment gone wrong, the walking dead and a timelord agent that has lain in wait for the Doctor to arrive for 100 years. Set in 1898 the novel is told from two different accounts written in a diary/report format from an inspector from Scotland Yard and a Solicitor. This format of writing has given the book an incredible amount of realism with the aspect of the time period it is set in and the style of writing is very reminiscent of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Plus the scenes involving being stalked by the living dead are incredibly reminiscent of Michael Myers from the Halloween series - SPOOKY!!!

The Boer War, WW1 and the beginnings of WW2. Each time the Doctor has a feeling that events to assassinate Churchill are being manipulated by an unknown team. Most impressive was the use of the 6th Doctor to relay a similar confrontation with Churchill during his 2nd persona. Once again, as in the Eight Doctors, Terrance Dicks is trying to smooth out continuity stuff-ups, by having the 2nd Doctor run errands for the CIA (Celestial Intervention Agency) just before his forced regeneration Therefore the 2nd Docs appearance and references to Jamie and Zoe about all knowledge of him being wiped from their minds in the Five Doctors was obviously during this period. One problem though - you don't really get to find out who or what the PLAYERS are. All characterisation is spot on. Well written, easily read, very entertaining - RECOMMENDED to all.	2002-03-22

It seems the creative team of Christopher Golden and Nancy Holder are perfect for writing the Buffy novels after this successful attempt. From the use of off-beat villians like the ERL-KING from Norse mythology, to the small, gremlin like, Dark Fairies. They retain all character aspects from the show, with the way the characters act and with their dialogue. Also able to bring an eerie, sense of forboding quality in all of the key scenes involving the Faere and the Wild Hunt.You'll find that the fight scenes are a bit more full-on than the tv show, with the cast actually receiving pretty full-on wounds, which is great and more truthful for the subject matter.

It starts off with the usual character intros, setting the seen, etc, then BAM!!!!, it turns into a super roller-coaster ride all the way to the end with no interuptions. This is the type of story you want out of an action movie. You finally think Schofield and team are about to resolve something but KAPOW!!, they start flying headlong into another of the many twists in the story. Easily read, this takes the best out of a Cussler novel and an action movie and seamlessly melds them together. Please, everyone, do yourself a favour, let your mind go, and purchase this book - you won't regret it. RECOMMENDED!!!!!	2002-02-25

Ahh, Gary Larson does it again with another compilation of his crazy, weird, sometimes unusual cartoons. Join him this time with hijinks at the zoo, Nature scenes we rarely see, the Mr Potato Head court case, cavemen adventures, ducks and many more hilarious situations from the funnier side of life.

To set a fifth Doctor story in a Third Doctor time period would seem a risky move, but Mark Morris successfully achieves this landing the Doctor in the 70's alongside his UNIT pals whilst the other Doctor is off planet somewhere else. Mark has written this with 4 chapters (episodes???) which has the cliffhangers at the end and plays just like the tv series would. Although the book is very violent in some places, with alien hybrids massacring nearly a whole town sending lots of blood and limbs flying. Characterisation is top notch from the Doctor's portrayal, brash Tegan, cowardly and self preserving Turlough to Mike Yates, Benton and the (younger) Brigadier. Overall, a fun, easily read book. RECOMMENDED!!!!	2002-02-19

This book puts everything that has happened in the Doctor Who universe from the TV series and Virgin novels into chronological order. A great feat to accomplish especially with all the discontinuity in the series. <BR>This book deserves an award - thanks Lance. RECOMMENDED!!!	2002-02-12

To save confusion, it's best to view the Doctor as a completely different, parallel universe Doctor instead of trying to place an already established Doctor in it. Lance Parkin has done a wonderful job in recreating Gallifrey, it's history and the fact that there are others living on the planet and not just the TimeLords. How could you not have a 35th Anniversary book without the potential grand destruction of the entire universe. This book is recommended for a change from the normal Doctor's exploits as I find alternate versions are always refreshing. Only probelme is that I found the Doctor's portrayal to be a little bland, but with everything else going on, with the mediation between Sontaran and Rutan factions and the return of a historical Gallifreyan hero, this hardly really mattered.<BR>An enjoyable read - RECOMMENDED!!!	2002-02-12

You will find hilarious cartoons, completely strange cartoons, rebellious cows, ducks, mugger bears, tales of cavemen, Scientist hijinks, all of which leave you gasping for air whilst you try to stop laughing.

This is one of the 'must read' books if you're enjoying the whole 'End Of Gallifrey' arc. One good thing about the book, is that Paul Cornell has decided to retain continuity that was set in the Virgin 'Happy Endings' book where the Brigadier has de-aged to mid-30's. Every character in the book is well presented - the best, of course, being the Brigadier. The ending is a corker as well - one of the best. WELL RECOMMENDED!!!!	2002-02-04

Wow - every time I read a novel from either of the two authors, I wish that I had seen it on tv. Their stories fit perfectly into the season type they are intended for. The Matrix is a perfect example. Right from the start you know something big is going down, as it's not always that the Doctor is terrified out of his wits. Best part of the novel was definitely the surprise villain 'The Ripper'. Wow!!!	2002-01-30

Yay - a story that shows that Leela is intelligent instead of a stupid savage. Put in her own jungle environment, Leela shines through as the star of this book even making the Doctor realise that even he has underestimated her. The only flaw with this book is it does tend to get a bit confusing at times. Well worth a read!!! Recommended!!	2002-01-28

The Doctor, Compassion and Fitz are separated right from the beginning as a result from fleeing a doomed space station. Sadly I found the only interesting bits to be read were about Fitz's exploits on the other world, Mechta, a colony for convalescents, whereas the Doctor was tending not to do much and Compassion was being annoyingly annoying once again (still with no insight of who or what she is). The action and pace does pick up in the 3rd part of the story, giving the Doctor and Compassion a more interesting exciting role to play. Worth a read, but don't expect much from it.	2002-01-20

The Cineverse is the home of all the B-Movies where the laws of 'Movie Magic' apply. See Roger at his heroically sidekick best as he runs from Cowboys, Pirates, Jungle Natives and the really evil Dr Dread. The first in a series, this book is great fun to read, it's not side-splittingly funny, but is really amusing. Now i'm going to have to track down the next in the series. Well recommended.	2002-01-20

This book strides away from the normal Troughton-esqe monster story and goes for a political type story instead. I found the book quite bland for at least the first half of the book, but you should stick with it as the pace and excitement greatly increases after the first half with the arrival of the VETACS (robot super warriors). Just approach this book as a no-brainer and you should find, at least, a little bit of enjoyment out of it.	2002-01-13

As a sequel to the story 'Planet of Evil' I find this book a success as it doesn't tread old ground like nearly every other sequel out there in sequel land. But, as with all books, there are some boring parts - mostly political situations. This is not one of the greatest books written, nor is it the worst. It's one of those that fit in the 'alright' category. But it does have an appearance by the red, see-through, crackly creature. Oh yeah, once AGAIN, Nyssa is turned into ANOTHER creature. No wonder she chose to stay in a leper colony instead of with the Doctor.	2002-01-08

From the first page the whole atmosphere of Diablo is created and maintained throughout the whole book. You'll find all references, placenames and people to help maintain this as 'sense of Diablo' as well. A positive thing about the book is that it doesn't retell the story of the games, as most PC based novels tend to do, and goes off on a story on its own, but does hint about the wanderer and the ever brewing evil from D2. This book can be enjoyed by those not into the fantasy genre as well as it's pure, no holds barred, Diablo with all its hacking and slashing along for the ride. Knaak certainly has the knack for writing these books	2002-01-08

Adapting one of the most popular and momentous stories of the series, Terrance Dicks brings about an exact replica of the show through the use of words. There is no going off on tangents to tell a deeper story, just everything that happens from the show, nothing else. Well recommended for a change.	2002-01-07

After a lot of negative feedback I was thinking that this book was going to be bad. But as it's DR WHO I knew I had to read it and must say that i enjoyed it. The idea of the TARDIS taking the now amnesiatic (that a word?) Doctor to meet his other selves was pretty cool. His meetings with the 1st, 3rd and 4th Docs impressing me the most. It got a bit confusing when meeting his 6th self and trying to tie up continuity within this period (which is virtually a nightmare to do) and downright disappointing with his 7th Doc meeting. There's also the introduction of new companion, Sam. Obviously, Terrances purpose was to introduce her but not to develop her character that much. This wouldn't be labled as a 'thinker' or 'groundbreaking' novel like some of the others, but for a no-brainer read, tis good.	2001-10-03

With the reappearance of PIKE from the movie, as he comes to Sunnydale for Buffy's help from his pursuing killer Golem, it gives us a little more background of what Buffy got up to between the movie and series. Plus something from Giles past comes back to haunt him, thus revealing a little more about his character. Great characterisation for all the cast makes you feel like you're watching a movie length episode. Really cool twists, great monsters. This book is definitely recommended to everyone.

While many people still dwell over the fact that Hal Jordan is no longer with us as the GREEN LANTERN (going nuts and killing all other GL's around then adopting a GOD-like attitude will do that to you), it seems that an equal amount if not more have accepted and ended up loving KYLE RAYNER as the newly appointed GL.

Michael Myers is on the rampage in Haddonfield again (you'd think they would expect him every halloween now). He's on a random teenage killing spree during and including the lead up to the school prom. Obviously aimed at a teen audience, fans will still find themselves enjoying and reliving the terror of Michael Myers. (Except for all his growling - what's up with that?) Recommended!!!	2001-10-03

If your a fan of the game (why would you read it if you aren't) you will love this. Knee-Deep tells the story of the first game in the DOOM series where ex-space marine Fly McTaggart takes on the invasion force of another dimension. All the monsters are here - imps, pig-things, big scary end of level guys, etc. You will find yourself reading the book and actually knowing where he is in the game.

It basically is a novelisation of the first episode of the ANGEL series with a few more historical tellings of Angel, Darla, Drusilla and Spike (well worth reading for these). The story was quite bland, hence all the historical padding. All in all though, Nancy Holder did a pretty fine job working with what she had.	2001-10-03
