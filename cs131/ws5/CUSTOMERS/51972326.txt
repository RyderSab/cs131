No, Americans don't eat enough \\"real\\" food (that is, food which was prepared from fresh, natural ingredients).  Yes, if we ate more real food and less fast food, we'd be healthier.      But here's where Dr. Brownell goes wrong.  He pushes the popular myth (already rejected by cooler heads within the medical profession) that if we were healthier, we'd automatically be *slimmer.*  As others have mentioned, he doesn't take individual choice into account.  Nor does he so much as mention the ill effects of dieting; from a researcher of eating disorders, such an oversight seems huge.    It has also already been said that Dr. Brownell--also the author of several weight-loss books--is himself a fat man.  Does this mean that he *himself* follows an unhealthy lifestyle rather than heeding his own advice to others...and is therefore no better off than anyone *else* his size?  Or does it mean that weight loss is *not,* in fact, always a health solution or even a likelihood--and that he is therefore a living flaw in his own argument?  Let the reader be the judge.	2005-03-22

But for quite a few years now, I've suspected that things aren't quite so cut-and-dried as \\"thin=good, healthy and virtuous; fat=bad, unhealthy, and sinful\\"--no matter how many people may thoughtlessly buy that notion.    And here we have it:  The weight-loss industry isn't fueled by concern about health, but by the desire to make money off of people's poor body image.  Most people aren't going to fit that ever-shrinking beauty ideal without resorting to dangerous methods.  *Everyone* should exercise and eat their vegetables, whether or not that results in weight loss:  For some people it will, for some people it won't, and that's all fine and good.    \\"Fat!So?\\" does not \\"promote\\" being fat.  What it \\"promotes\\" is doing all that you can to be healthy and happy in your own body--even if that body is somehow socially unacceptable.  And I would argue that that is a *good* message for people (such as myself) who are working their way past anorexia and/or self-image problems.    One more thing that I'd like to add:  The idea that readers would be better off reading something by Susan Estrich or Susan Powter is disheartening.  Marilyn Wann addresses us *all,* and exhorts us to be active and healthy regardless of our size.  The Susans address only average-to-thin women, and exhort us to hate our bodies for being \\"too fat.\\"  It seems obvious which message is more positive...and *healthier.*	2004-09-30

A lot of books like this have hit the shelves in the last two-and-a-half years:  Volumes that capitalize on 9-11 to demonize some group of people.  But Dan Flynn doesn't demonize the terrorists...he demonizes his fellow Americans.  Specifically, those among the population whose politics he doesn't like.  <br />Here's an example of the tone of the book:  Early on (in the introduction, in fact), he comments briefly on an offensive statement made by poet bell hooks.  In an extensive footnote, he informs us that he has made a point of capitalizing her name.  He then goes on to say that her forswearance of capitals--and the fact that she has legally changed her name--proves that she is &quot;silly,&quot; &quot;egotistical,&quot; and (ironically enough) &quot;juvenile.&quot;   It doesn't end there, either:  Later in the book, he takes the obligatory shots at intellectuals and the media, flinging terms such as &quot;Orwellian.&quot;<br />Plus, he just can't get enough of the fact that he's been kicked out of a few lectures, and claims that it's because of his political beliefs.  News flash, Dan:  No one wants to listen to Michael Moore, either.<br />Nonetheless, I'll give him this much:  He makes an attempt to be specific, and he's marginally more rational than Ann Coulter.  That's about it.	2004-07-01

Weight is not necessarily a good indicator of either health or lifestyle.  Mainstream weight-loss methods are often either downright dangerous or merely ineffective.  And some people--no matter how well they take care of themselves--are just never going to fit that svelte ideal.    In the midst of the current obesity-epidemic panic, these ideas are controversial.  As such, some people may be quick to dismiss them--as evidenced by several customer reviews of this book.  But the supporting data is sound; and the tone--calm and professional without being dry--is a welcome change from the pomposity and hysteria that characterize many other \\"fat books.\\"	2004-06-01

Between that, her excessive use of loaded words (the book's very title, for example), and her constant schoolyard insults (wasn't she also the author of a book called \\"Slander,\\" and wasn't it about how her *opponents* can't argue without resorting to name-calling?), she's about as fit as Michael Moore to offer a serious political opinion.<br />So...what's the difference, apart from their positions on the political spectrum, between Ann Coulter and Michael Moore?<br />Moore presents himself as a comedian.

However, it was clearly adapted from an early version of the script--written before the movie was fully cast.  Much of the storyline does not conform to the movie, and there are several major incongruities (such as a character played by Thomas Haden Church declaring himself to be the tallest man in a group which contains Abraham Benrubi and Greg Cruttwell).    Overall, it's a cute little book.  But (and I never thought I'd say this) I'd rather watch the movie.	2003-01-04

That's the premise of \\"The Dragon Delasangre,\\" and it's quite a good idea.    But here's an idea of how bad this book is: I have something of an obsession with dragons, and I would *not* read it a second time.    Troop tries to be Anne Rice, and falls flat on his face. Perhaps this is because Ms. Rice actually uses vampire myths for her tortured predators. Troop discards all dragon legendry, attempts to create his own, and fails miserably.     So what we have are big green (yes, green; invariably green) flying lizards which *happen* to be able to shape-shift like Chinese dragons, but bear no other resemblance. Their mating habits are altogether too human to be truly alien, but at the same time too alien to be human (or even believable). They prey on humans not out of necessity, but out of convenience. Their \\"human\\" identities are always both devastatingly attractive and independently wealthy. And of course, they are Not Evil, But Just Misunderstood.    The protagonist (hero, or even antihero, does not fit), Peter Delasangre, starts out as a seemingly honorable example of a more-or-less amoral race. But he quickly becomes much like Troop has led us to expect of dragons, and ends up despicable even by the standards of his deplorable kind. If this transformation were more gradual, or if the story meant to explain it were more than a gory soap opera, it might have been understandable.  Instead, it just prevents Delasangre from being in any way a sympathetic character.    All in all, I have no idea how anyone could rate this higher than Anne McCaffrey's earlier work. If you want to read about dragons, almost *anything* is better than \\"The Dragon Delasangre.\\"	2002-10-31
US	51972326	R38HVBBK30PCAA	0440220297	164900378	Life in the Fat Lane	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Well....	I'm not entirely sure what to think of this book. <br />On the one hand, I like the premise of the story. \\"Life in the Fat Lane\\" deals with a girl who is suddenly faced with circumstances beyond her control. Because of these circumstances, her friends desert her; and she goes from being part of the \\"in crowd\\" to being a walking target for their abuse. (As a former target myself, I've experienced such abuse firsthand.)<br />On the other hand, I have a difficult time sympathizing with Lara.  I can *pity* her--when her friends turn against her, when she's being taunted at her new school, or for her awful family situation--but what I *can't* do is particularly like or even respect her.  She acts as if it's her deity-given right to be admired and envied. When she starts gaining weight, she moans about how fat she is (even at 5'7\\" and 128#)--a trend that continues throughout the book.  When she's scorned by her false friends and held in contempt by her appearance-conscious parents, she blames her own weight rather than their blatant superficiality.  <br />Even when you finally think that she should have done some growing up, she turns around and acts petty again: For example, even at her heaviest, she never loses her mild contempt for anyone *else* who's fat. All in all, she's barely less of a vain, self-absorbed prima donna than the spoiled girls who mock her. <br />In short, \\"Life in the Fat Lane\\" would have been vastly improved by a less annoying and static heroine. Most of the other characters, with a few notable exceptions such as Jett and Molly, are cardboard cutouts.  (Patty's smugly spiteful response to Lara's weight gain was especially unnecessary.)  Making Lara a stronger character--or at least, more than an incessant whine attached to a metabolic disorder--would have been a coup on Ms. Bennett's part.	2002-08-16
