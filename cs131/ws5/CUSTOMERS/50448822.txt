Until you fact-check Viereck's claims, especially his citations. This was no genuine exploration of the origins of Nazi ideas, \\"the roots of the Nazi mind\\". This was a polemicist with an extremely conservative cultural, religious and political agenda, smearing with a proto-Nazi tag those aesthetic and cultural movements that he happens to dislike.<br /><br />Viereck's main target was the romantic movement of the 19th century, especially but not only Richard Wagner. Although Viereck wrote in the manner of a moralist condemning the romantics from on high, his agenda led him into certain failings of his own. His portrayal of \\"Father Jahn\\" and other figures bear false witness, and he commits academic sins like altering texts, inventing fictitious works, misleading quotation, and the like.<br /><br />Basically Viereck's story was that the National Socialist flame was lit by Friedrich Jahn, who supposedly influenced the early German romantics, Fichte, Herder and so on, who then passed the torch to Wagner, who synthesised their evil ideas into a fully-fledged Nazi philosophy with all pieces complete, from F&uuml;hrer-principle to Holocaust, which Hitler then picked up and applied.<br /><br />This is nonsense. First, the historical Friedrich Jahn was neither a proto-Nazi nor an especially important figure. Viereck truthfully called Jahn a German nationalist, which sounds sinister because of 20th century history, but glossed over the fact that Jahn's nationalism came at a time when the German states were occupied, ruled and plundered by foreign armies under Napoleon. To be a nationalist under those circumstances was to resist tyranny, not promote it.<br /><br />Viereck elides the fact that Jahn was an outspoken democrat who insisted that French rule should be replaced by a democratic, independent and unified Germany. I feel no defensiveness towards Jahn; though no proto-Nazi he was an antisemite with insufficient other merits to balance that fact. But misrepresentation is irritating.<br /><br />Viereck greatly exaggerates Jahn's importance. Jahn founded his Turnverein (gymnastics organisation) movement in 1811 and lost control of it with his imprisonment in 1819, and though he remained generally respected until his death in 1852, he exercised precious little influence. I've looked for references to Jahn in the work of the German romantics, and found only a satirical _attack_ on Jahn in an 1823 play by the romantic playwright Joseph von Eichendorff.<br /><br />Viereck's portrait of the early German romantics defames admirable people, brotherhood-of-man democrats and liberals like Herder. Fichte is less admirable, but is also utterly misrepresented. Even those German Romantics who did lose their liberalism in old age didn't turn to any form of radical rightwingery that could be called proto-Nazi. They reverted to conservative Catholicism and monarchism.<br /><br />Viereck's attack on Wagner illustrates his method. For example Viereck's first, 1941, edition of this book was the first text to frame Wagner by quoting the concluding words of \\"Judaism in Music\\" while - without alerting the reader - omitting Wagner's key words, \\"for then we shall be one and indivisible\\", in order to hide the fact that Wagner was calling for assimilation. This deception has been much imitated since.<br /><br />(Several of Viereck's supposed Wagner quotes are actually mosaics assembled by Viereck; Wagnerian phrases taken by Viereck from contexts often decades apart, and reassembled by him to form new arrangements and new meanings. Using that method I could mke Wagner, or Viereck, say whatver I felt like. It is entirely unaceptable.)<br /><br />Viereck claimed that Wagner's call for the founding of a people's army, in his \\"The Revolution\\" essay, was \\"a dream akin to what R&ouml;hm in 1934 envisaged for his Storm Troopers.\\" But Wagner's text called for the army to be under the control of a democratically elected government. Did Viereck really not know the difference between Storm Troopers in a Nazi state, and an army accountable to an elected government?<br /><br />Viereck also claimed that Wagner invented the F&uuml;hrer-principle. You'll find no such idea in Wagner, since Wagner was a young anarchist who eventually drifted as far right as supporting constitutional monarchy. So Viereck claimed that when Wagner used \\"a number of other terms, especially 'hero', 'folk-king' and 'Barbarossa'\\", he really meant \\"F&uuml;hrer\\". Viereck pioneered the technique of claiming that if Wagner's words don't support your conspiracy theory, then the words must be in a secret code. Thus anything can be said to mean any old thing, making \\"proving\\" a case much easier.<br /><br />Viereck also invented a Wagner essay called \\"Heroism\\", which apparently called for racial purity under a dictatorship. There is no such Wagner essay, nor any Wagner essay that ever called for either racial purity or dictatorship. Wagner's clearest late statement on political systems, \\"State and Religion\\", advocated constitutional monarchy, the monarch exercising a symbolic function above politics, while political parties of \\"men of equal rights\\" contended for office.<br /><br />Wagner did write, in an essay called \\"Heroism and Christianity\\", that there was no such thing as a German race and that Europeans should get used to racial intermingling, explicitly advocating racial equality \\"under a universal moral concord, such as only Christianity can bring about.\\"<br /><br />Is \\"Heroism and Christianity\\" related to Viereck's fictitious \\"Heroism\\" essay? Hard to say. Still, Viereck, who writes from a rightwing Christian worldview, needed to insist that the late Wagner was anti-Christian, though the essays and _Diaries_ show this is quite untrue. This can have comic results, as when Viereck used an anti-Christian remark by the young Wagner to prove that _Parsifal_, written decades later, must be anti-Christian.

US	50448822	R3MTHDG5S0M7RL	006095339X	497867283	Explaining Hitler	Books	5	58	60	N	N	Hitler and the historians	Rosenbaum opened this thoughtful and literate review of the supposed \\"explanations\\" for Hitler with a gripping account of a winter journey to Hitler's birthplace in the Austrian hinterland, to glean what can be gleaned from the - largely obliterated - traces of his family and early life. There is effective use of the dangerous iciness of the mountain roads as a metaphor for some of the people and places he encountered there: cold to the bone, dangerous, and frozen in time.  <br /> <br />That set-piece opening led to a consideration of some of the \\"explanations\\" of Hitler's madness and evil: that Hitler had been abused as a child, that he was genitally deformed, or even that he was born normal but traumatised when his genitals were mutilated by - of all things - a goat. These and some of the other speculations that have been offered - that Hitler was homosexual, that he had caught syphilis from a Jewish prostitute, that he was brainwashed into megalomania by a doctor experimenting with new psychological techniques, and so on - led Rosenbaum to a fascinating discussion of what is involved in even attempting to \\"explain Hitler\\".   <br /> <br />Rosenbaum noted that many of the attempts at explaining Hitler tend, deliberately or not, to reduce the focus on his evil. To understand is to forgive, at least a little, and risks reducing Hitler to a victim, whether of other people or of circumstances. Worse, many of the proffered explanations put the blame on Jews, for example Weisenthal's notion of the (probably imaginary) Jewish prostitute who gave Hitler the clap.   <br /> <br />Rosenbaum then examined some of the people who have made a career, or a business, of \\"explaining Hitler\\", beginning with engaging portraits of the old school historians Trevor-Roper and Bullock, two wise and wily old dons from an intellectual and academic world that has since largely - regrettably - vanished. This was followed by portraits of Claude Lanzmann, who came to feel he owned the Holocaust,and of David Irving, who tried to minimise it and deny Hitler's guilt, whose treatment is less affectionate. For these sections alone, and for the fascinating material on those journalists, Hitler's contemporaries, who tried to warn Germany and the world what Hitler was, and paid for their courage with their lives, this book deserves classic status.   <br /> <br />But the book loses momentum and coherence somewhere past the half-way point. The editing is partly at fault, but worse, Rosenbaum's critical reasoning and crap-detecting seem to flag. He settles, finally, for Lucy Davidowicz's idea that Hitler had planned the Holocaust as early as 1918, based on isolated lines from Hitler speeches, such as, \\"they [the Jews] are not laughing now.\\" It was a pity to see Rosenbaum apply critical reading for most of the book only to let his guard down completely for something as flimsy as this. The words Davidowicz cited do not say what she claims they say.  <br /> <br />Previously Rosenbaum had challenged people who backed their claims with rhetoric rather than evidence, insisting on precision on what words were said, what they meant, who said them, and when. Davidowicz's claims are not only contradicted by almost all recent work on the Holocaust (as an atrocity that evolved over time and took its final form after the war had commenced), they are not even supported by her own citations. And Davidowicz's \\"explanation\\" would explain nothing even if it were true. She offered a fanciful and unconvincing answer to the question \\"when?\\", but the real question is not \\"when\\" but \\"why?\\"  <br /> <br />However Rosenbaum's earlier chapters more than justify buying and keeping this book. The most reasonable conclusion, taking Rosenbaum into account, is that we will never know the cause of Hitler's madness and evil, but this is not the real issue. Ultimately Hitler was a squalid psychopath, in the same broad category as, say, Charles Manson or Jeffrey Dahmer. He was intelligent, with the ability to charm and impress people when he needed, and murderously mad. Any alternative-history version of Hitler's life would probably have finished with him as a mass murderer: but he should have been another lone killer with a grisly basement and victims numbering in the tens, or fewer, not a head of state with victims in the tens of millions.  <br /> <br />So although \\"why?\\" is the right question, we should perhaps not direct it at Hitler, but at the forces that put him in a position of power. That means looking at the political, military and business figures, who were basically sane, and evil only on a normal human scale, who actually did the deals that made Hitler the German Chancellor against the wishes of the majority of the German electorate. And even after Hitler was in power, there was a long period after it was quite clear - \\"crystal\\" clear - what he was, when it was still possible to remove him, had the will been there.    <br /> <br />That group, who nurtured a rootless psychopath and put him into power for their own varied purposes, and who kept him there until he destroyed them too: perhaps it's the people like Papen, Hugenberg, Hindenberg and others, who have not yet received their share of historical scrutiny, or of humanity's hatred, ridicule and contempt. I suspect that this group is the best place to look for meaningful answers, not only to the question, \\"how?\\", but also to that most anguished of questions: \\"why?\\" <br /> <br />(People sometimes defame democracy by claiming that Hitler came to power by democratic means. In fact the Nazis never won an election, and had lost ground in the election before Hitler was appointed Chancellor. Hitler was installed into power in a betrayal of the voters, and thereafter there were no elections.)  <br /> <br />Though \\"Explaining Hitler\\" ends disappointingly, it still offers some fascinating portraits of heroes and villains, historians and pseudo-historians, and a great deal of interesting and insightful writing. Though I don't always agree with his conclusions, it is never less than a pleasure to read Rosenbaum thinking aloud. Strongly recommended.   <br /> <br /> <br />Laon <br /> <br />	2005-05-29

I wish Siegfried had composed more.  <br /> <br />But the only aspect of Richard Wagner's talent that reached as far as his grandchildren and great-grandchildren is that for writing self-serving autobiographies. In fact a minor literary genre has been established: memoirs by people who are famous only for being a descendent of Richard Wagner. Thus we have _Shadow over Bayreuth_ by Friedelind Wagner, _Acts_ by her brother Wolfgang [\\"it may be called _Acts_, but it sure aint Gospel\\"], the book by Gottfried Wagner that has so far been published under three different titles, and counting, and Nike's _The Wagners: The Dramas of a Musical Dynasty_.     <br /> <br />The only Wagner descendent with an interesting story to tell, and a ghost writer who told it well, was Friedelind. But then she appears to have been a genuinely likeable, if extremely difficult, human being, who inherited some of her grandfather's courage and directed it against the Nazis, in the certainty (I think utterly justified) that he would have approved.  <br /> <br />The remainder of the Wagner memoirs are marked principally by petulance, the tone tending to waver between the whiny and the snarky. Of these, Nike's book is the least bad. So what can we say about Nike's book, beyond that it is better than Gottfried's or Wolfgang's books?  <br /> <br />The most interesting section is the family history, which from my point of view contains a few, all too few, anecdotes or glimpses of the last Wagner descendants to be at all interesting in their own right: that is, Siegfried Wagner and his daughter Friedelind.   <br /> <br />Nike thinks that her father, Wieland Wagner, was also a major creative person, like his father and grandfather. I don't think that, though it depends on what you mean by \\"creative\\"; certainly he was a moderately innovative theatre director. Anyway, she gives us a partial portrait of Wieland. I feel her account is slightly bowdlerised, perhaps because she is making her claim to the Bayreuth Festival through her descent from Wieland, and therefore she would not wish to bring into question his fitness to have been involved in the post-War Bayreuth. So awkward matters like Wieland's involvement with the Flossenberg Concentration Camp remain glossed over.  <br /> <br />On the evidence of this book, it seems that if Nike's claim on the festival were to be successful, it would not result in greater openness in relation to the Bayreuth archives for the period 1920-1945.      <br /> <br />The rest of Nike's more recent family gossip is of less interest to me, since none of the living Wagners are especially interesting people. They belong in the society pages, and not in cultural coverage. Except perhaps Wolfgang, who could look back on and reveal much about a fascinating historical period; but his \\"autobiography\\" makes it clear he has no intention of doing so.  <br /> <br />The other part of the book reveals Nike's thoughts about the works, and ideas for revitalising the festival. The thoughts are mostly moderately interesting, if not blindingly insightful. The only oddity is bringing the early 20th century nutcase Otto Weininger into her discussion of _Parsifal_. The trouble is that Weininger was a tormented homosexual Jewish man who hated homosexuals and Jews in general, and himself in particular, also hating women, while he was about it, and committed suicide.  <br /> <br />I suspect Nike bought into the 1960s/1970s idea that insane people are somehow more insightful and interesting than the rest of us. In fact the opposite is true. Weininger's thoughts on _Parsifal_ are as relevant to an understanding of that work as Charlie Manson's thoughts on the _White Album_ are relevant to the exegesis of that Beatles' classic.  <br /> <br />As for Nike's thoughts on the Festival, I think they have merit. It would be useful to perform Wagner's earlier operas at Bayreuth as part of the Festival, perhaps not in the main theatre, and also to perform operas that influenced him (Beethoven, Cherubini, Marschner, Weber, and others), and were influenced by him. And Bayreuth should commission and perform new operas, which surely is what Wagner meant by \\"Children, do something new.\\"  <br /> <br />So Nike's thoughts about the festival make a worthwhile contribution. Still, as for the succession, with some sentimental regret I think that it should go to the best candidate, and I think it astronomically unlikely that the best candidate will be called Wagner.    <br /> <br />Summary: a mildly interesting book. Very far from essential, but at least readable. And I'd rather spend time in her company (I mean as a reader) than either Gottfried or Wolfgang. What a terrible shame, by the way, that Siegfried Wagner didn't write an autobiography.  <br /> <br />Cheers! <br /> <br /> <br />Laon <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-12-23
US	50448822	RA57JU17S85P4	0195132424	688068987	The Twisted Muse: Musicians and Their Music in the Third Reich	Books	2	73	75	N	N	Disappointing; regrettably unreliable	I went to this book for some background information on the Nazi reception of modernism in music. Unfortunately, though I found it well written, and I share Kater's mordant view of the composers and musicians who were prepared to futher their careers by going along with Nazi policies, I found that I would hesitate before I cited or applied factual claims from the book without first getting independent confirmation.   <br /> <br />The problem is that I do know one related area reasonably well, the Nazi reception and perception of Wagner. And what Kater says there is not just wrong, but wrong in ways that I find  worrying. It's not that I think that Wagner is the most important issue in relation to Third Reich cultural policies - far from it. It's just that when you find that you can't trust what a book says about a field you do know, it leaves you worried about its claims in the areas you don't know.   <br /> <br />Three examples. First, Kater wrote, \\"The evidence shows that although public stagings of Wagner operas nationally had been decreasing long before the onset of the Third Reich, and even more so after 1933, in absolute figures these performances still topped the list until 1942/43, with works by such composers as Verdi, Puccini, and Strauss well behind.\\" [page 39]  <br /> <br />In reality \\"public stagings of Wagner operas nationally\\" increased each year before \\"the onset of the Third Reich\\", right up to the 1932/33 season, but decreased immediately and dramatically after the Nazis took power, for the 1933/34 season, and that decrease continued and accelerated during the Nazi era.  <br /> <br />And although Wagner had invariably \\"topped the list\\" under the Weimar democracy, with hundreds more Wagner performances each year than performances of any of his nearest rivals, in reality he quickly lost that position once the Nazis seized the cultural reins. Wagner had lost first place to Verdi by the 1937/38 season, regained it (by just 18 performances) in 1938/39, and then lost by hundreds of performances in 1939/40, slipping further down the ranks in subsequent years. Some people may find that surprising, but there it is.    <br /> <br />Second, Kater wrote of Hitler's \\"autobiography, which he started writing while imprisoned as Landsberg in 1924-25, naming it _Mein Kampf_, not accidentally after Richard Wagner's own _Mein Leben_.\\"  <br /> <br />But there are two problems with Kater's claim that the title \\"My Struggle\\" is a sort of homage to Wagner's title, \\"My Life\\". One is that all that the two titles have in common is the word \\"My\\", like \\"My Apprenticeship\\" by Maxim Gorki, \\"My Life\\", by Bill Clinton, and so on. More importantly, Hitler actually called his book _Four and a Half Years of Struggle Against Corruption, Stupidity and Lies_. The snappier title, _Mein Kampf_, was chosen by Hitler's publishers.  <br /> <br />Still, maybe Kater misread the tables of performance numbers. Maybe he didn't know Hitler's own title for his autobiography. Still, _The Twisted Muse_ is Kater's sixth book about the Third Reich and its cultural policies. Shouldn't a specialist, whose publishing history suggests he'd been working this territory for over 20 years when this book came out, know this stuff?    <br /> <br />Which leads to my third example, the problem of Kater's Rosenberg quote. Kater derided the evidence, cited in Frederick Spotts' _Bayreuth_ history, that the Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg was hostile to Wagner. Kater's supposed clincher, proving that Rosenberg was a fervent Wagnerian, was this quotation from Rosenberg's _Myth of the Twentieth Century_: \\"The cultural accomplishment of Bayreuth is perennially beyond discussion.\\"  <br /> <br />But in Rosenberg's book this sentence is not in fact part of a eulogy to Wagner, as Kater would have you believe, but the beginning of a criticism of Wagner that dismisses his theories and much of his work, especially the _Ring_ and _Parsifal_. The actual passage, from Book II, chapter 4, goes:   <br /> <br />\\"The cultural achievement of Bayreuth will remain forever beyond question. But nevertheless, today a turning away from the basic teachings of Wagner has begun, away from the assertion that dance, music and the poetic art are forever linked in the manner proclaimed by him; and away from the assertion that Bayreuth was, in fact, the unchangeable consummation of the Aryan mystery.\\" <br /> <br />Could Kater have read the one sentence he cited, then instantly closed his eyes and shut the book so that he never saw the next sentence, which happened to change Rosenberg's meaning completely? It doesn't seem possible. It's difficult to see how this quotation could be anything other than deliberately deceptive.    <br /> <br />Kater, obviously, was running a very strong agenda, in relation to Wagner. Now, it's possible that someone can get carried away because of a controversy, and be unreliable only in that area while remaining scrupulously accurate in all other areas. But my problem is, I don't know. I read an statement by Kater about the Nazi reception of modernism, and I wonder, \\"But is that really true? Or if it is true, is it misleadingly selected?\\" And I can't tell. I can't rely on it.  <br /> <br />Fortunately, there's another book covering the same territory, that passes the test of being accurate in areas I know, and that seems academically scrupulous in the areas I don't know. That's Erik Levi's _Music in the Third Reich_, published in 1994, also available from Amazon. Levi is no more impressed by Wagner's antisemitism than Kater is, or I am, but that doesn't drive him to start making stuff up, and that's important.  <br /> <br />Therefore Levi's _Music in the Third Reich_ is the book in this field that I cite with confidence, and that's the book that I've kept. I recommend Levi's book. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this one.  <br /> <br />Cheers! <br /> <br /> <br />Laon <br /> <br />	2004-08-10
US	50448822	R2XN0Z7NADHVI3	0691026211	988367106	Richard Wagner, Fritz Lang, and the Nibelungen	Books	1	40	44	N	N	The misrepresentation is mainly by omission	David Levin's book _Richard Wagner, Fritz Lang and the Nibelungen_ centers around the allegation that Mime in Wagner's opera _Siegfried_, and Alberich in Fritz Lang's 1920 film _Die Nibelungen_ (both dwarfs), are antisemitic representations. <br />Levin's arguments for these twin accusations will cause jaw-dropping disbelief in anyone familiar with Wagner's or Lang's work. He writes: \\"Thus Mime is repeatedly shown to be narrating (a terrible thing in Wagner's eyes and works) while Alberich embodies a version of 'Hollywood' cinema (a terrible thing in Lang's eyes and works).\\" <br />Anyone who's seen or heard a Wagner opera knows that far from narration being \\"a terrible thing in Wagner's eyes\\", it's a Wagner specialty. All Wagner's important characters are incorrigible narrators, to an extent that's notoriously off-putting for newcomers. (Levin later claims that Mime is unique because he narrates events that haven't previously been represented in dramatic form. Nice try, but so do most of Wagner's other characters, from Senta and the Dutchman to Wotan and Gurnemantz.) <br />This isn't just a minor error. It's actually Levin's whole argument concerning Wagner: that Wagner's character Mime was a narrator, Wagner hated narrators and thought narration was somehow Jewish, therefore Mime is an antisemitic representation and the _Ring_ is an antisemitic parable. <br />But if we took Levin's test seriously, all the major Wagnerian characters would be Jewish representations, and Wagner would emerge as the most obsessively philosemitic dramatist in history. (Except that according to Levin's test, everyone in Greek tragedy and Japanese Noh drama is Jewish too.)<br />Levin's accusation against Fritz Lang is that his _Nibelungen_ film, made in Germany in 1920, was antisemitic in its depiction of the dwarf Alberich. Levin gave two grounds for his claim that Lang's Alberich is an antisemitic representation. <br />First, Levin said that Lang's biographer Lotte Eisner had claimed that critic Siegfried Kracauer had thought that Lang's depiction of Alberich was antisemitic. Unfortunately for Levin, Kracauer's discussion of Lang's film is in print, and Kracauer made no such allegation. More importantly, Kracauer's opinion would only have weight if Kracauer had actually provided arguments or evidence in support of this reading of Lang's film. So Levin's first piece of supporting evidence is unsubstantiated hearsay; that one critic, Kracauer, may or may not have thought Lang's Alberich was a Jewish caricature, but provided no arguments in support of that interpretation, which he probably did not support. <br />Well, you can't get much more convincing than that! <br />And Levin doesn't. His other argument is that Alberich took Siegfried into an underground cave and shone an image on the wall: the Nibelungs mining for gold. Levin argued, essentially, that projecting images on a wall (a symbol of filmmaking) is somehow a Jewish thing to do. Therefore Lang's Alberich is an antisemitic Jewish caricature. <br />Obviously that's not much of an argument, expressed so baldly. So Levin expressed it hairily. Delving into the works of Freud, Klein, Lacan, etc, he engaged in a great deal of oracular pronouncing and general arm-waving. It's probably fair to describe Freudianism as a dead religion now the Freud Wars are over, and Levin did his case little good by tying so much of it to the Freudian tradition. <br />But against Levin's psychoanalytic flights of fancy there's just one awkward fact. It's that Fritz Lang was of Jewish descent, and he fled Nazi Germany to America (to Hollywood) partly because of politics and partly because of his Jewish ancestry. <br />How did Levin deal with that awkward fact? The same way he dealt with the awkward fact that _everybody_ in Wagner is a narrator, not just Mime. Levin simply didn't mention it. But at one point he cited a biography of Fritz Lang, so he can't credibly claim ignorance of the awkward fact.   <br />An intellectually honest academic has to mention facts that hurt their thesis, and argue around them. A book that simply buries awkward facts, presumably in the hope that the readers won't know better, is not an intellectually honest book.  <br />Levin does a lot of omitting awkward facts. For example Levin tells us that when Wagner's Siegfried (_Siegfried_ Act II) killed Mime it was because Mime was sort of Jewish; Siegfried heard Mime narrating, and realised that narrators are aliens who should be killed. Next stop, Levin suggests, is the Holocaust. <br />But Levin can only argue this by omitting the actual content of Mime's speech. Mime was telling Siegfried, inadvertently but truthfully, that he intended to drug Siegfried unconscious and then decapitate him. Thus Siegfried could not risk sleeping, if he wanted to wake up again. In a forest, unattended by a police service with the resources to apprehend murderous stalkers, Siegfried killed Mime in self-defence: not because Mime was a narrator, but because Mime would kill him the next time he fell asleep. (By the way Mime's threat to Siegfried was not even narration. It was exposition. Since \\"narration\\" is such a central concept in Levin's book, he should at least know what \\"narration\\" means.) <br />Here, as with his claims about narration in Wagner, and whether Fritz Lang is likely to have made antisemitic movies, Levin used the technique known as \\"misrepresentation by omission\\". He also applied this technique in his discussion of Wagner's prose. But although I'd meant to discuss such things as Levin's claim that Siegfried burnt down the world ash tree in order to forge Nothung (a false claim that suggests that Levin may not have actually read the _Ring_ libretto), and many other things, I'm close to the word limit. <br />Basically this book is nonsense. Wagner students are used to this sort of thing; Wagner brings out this sort of tin-foil-hatted lunacy in some academics. But admirers of Fritz Lang, in the real world a victim rather than a perpetrator of Nazi bigotry, have the right to be a little annoyed by this mildly misleading piece of work.  <br />Cheers! <br />Laon	2003-12-29

Many meretricious books have been launched into the world with the words \\"al Qaeda\\" on the titlepage: those words sell books. This book is unusual, not for being unreliable about al Qaeda, though it is that, but for failing to bother overmuch with the topic so prominently announced in its title.    <br />Gray's book spends most of its time being unreliable about modernity, instead. Gray's attack on modernity, sometimes modernism, is his real project; al Qaeda was cited partly for sales considerations but also to associate Gray's real bugbears with things that people revile.  <br />Gray's book exhibits three fundamental flaws. First, Gray tends to conflate the Enlightenment, \\"modernism\\" and modernity, assuming that modern (or modernist) thinking, like Enlightenment thinking, privileges rationality as a guide to truth, assumes that liberal democracy is the only sensible future for humanity, and is on the whole optimistic. <br />This is simply wrong; Gray's modernity, like modernism, includes strong respect for the irrational, nostalgia for the \\"primitive\\" both in discourse and in art, and is significantly more distrustful of technology and \\"progressive\\" politics, and less optimistic, than Enlightenment thinking. <br />Second, Gray seems to think that if he demonstrates that a set of ideas has a single silly aspect, then he has demolished that entire set of ideas. So Gray makes much of the quasi-religious aspects of the \\"Positivism\\" (not positivism in its current sense) of Saint-Simon and Compte. Fine; there's good comedy there. But Gray seems to think that showing that Saint-Simon and Compte said some silly things, among the many sensible things they said, and identifying them as Enlightenment figures, must necessarily discredit the whole Enlightenment project. <br />Here Gray is being bewilderingly silly. It's not even as if Saint-Simon or Compte were particularly central or important Enlightenment figures. Even if they had been, ridiculing their quasi-religious projects no more damages their other ideas than noting Newton's interest in numerology discredits Newton's physics. It's like singling out two learned divines of the late 18th century, who perhaps believed in God and phlogiston, and claiming that because those two clerics said some silly things therefore the whole of Christianity, all of it, must necessarily collapse.  <br />I find it hard to believe that Gray took his own rhetoric seriously, here. He either made a very feeble logical mistake or he hoped to win at rhetorical sleight of hand. But successful sleight of hand requires speed; and though this is a short book it is ponderous. <br />Third, Gray's \\"modern\\" has no clear boundaries: it includes anything that suits Gray's argument. Gray's conflation of the Enlightenment, modernism and the \\"modern\\" helps his claim that Stalinism drew on Enlightment ideas, though the most important and nightmarish aspects of Stalinism had nothing of the Enlightenment in them.  Moreover Stalinism embraced some aspects of modernist ideology and style, so it's not quite meaningless to claim Stalinism as modern. But Stalinism's anti-intellectual authoritarianism, bloody and millenarian, really dates back to totalitarianisms that long pre-dated the Enlightenment, or modernism, or \\"modernity\\". Examples include the Spanish-ruled Netherlands and Cromwell's republic, but really Russia's own ancient history provides the real ancestors for Stalin. <br />Gray counts Nazism as a modernist movement, a claim that would have offended both Nazis and modernists. Again, Gray's conflation of modernism and the Enlightenment makes it necessary to point out that Nazism was not a product of the Enlightenment except in the negative sense that Enlightenment ideas were among the things the Nazis most passionately rejected. Nor was Nazism modernist; modernists were peoplethat the Nazis silenced, or exiled, or killed. Gray claims the Nazis as modern simply because of their well-earned status as villains: the same reason he has for claiming that al Qaeda is modern.       <br />How does Gray argue that al Qaeda is modern? First, he seems to think that the idea of changing human culture, changing the world, is essentially modern, so that if al Qaeda has global aims (as it obviously does), then it surely must be modern too. <br />But both Christianity and Islam had projects for changing the whole world, also and changing human nature, long before modernism or modernity existed. Al Qaeda's fantasy of murderous conquest (enacted in real murders) is precisely Medieval in seeking the restoration of the 7th century Caliphate and the expansion of an early-Medieval version of Islam to the world. <br />Second, Gray makes much of al Qaeda's use of technology like the Internet. But Al Qaeda's use of technology no more links them to the modern, or modernism, or the Enlightenment, than the innovative use of gunpowder in combat, nearly a thousand years ago, by al Qaeda's predecessors in murderous religious irredentism, Christian as well as Muslim. <br />Third, Gray is right to say that important aspects of al Qaeda's ideology resemble those of 20th century movements like Stalinism and Nazism. But he overlooks the extent to which both Nazism and Stalinism have their roots in essentially religious and statist authoritarianisms that long pre-date the last few centuries: Nazism, Stalinism and al-Qaeda all have important common ancestors which are much older than modernity, or modernism. And the Enlightenment should not take the rap for any of them. <br />So this book is another example of a writer connecting their personal hobbyhorses to best-selling search keywords like \\"al Qaeda\\", \\"terrorism\\", \\"9/11\\", etc. The book's connection to the subject matter announced in its title is so slight as to be significantly misleading. But it's not a worthwhile book even in its own terms. <br />Finally, reading Gray has reminded me that the Enlightenment is looking pretty fresh, clean and attractive, from this vantage point in history.  Certainly Gray has reawakened my interest in Enlightenment writers like Hume, Voltaire and others, all of whom write better than Gray.<br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2003-10-19
US	50448822	R2YMMRUD8CZA1P	0743452933	771668256	The Demon Lover: The Roots of Terrorism	Books	1	42	67	N	N	Cash-in reissue of 1980s book: note subtle title change	The terrorist atrocity of 9/11 spurred a lot of writers into thought.  Unfortunately, the thought was usually something like this: \\"I've got a book in the works, or out of print, touching on terrorism, Islam, the Israel-Palestine nightmare, etc.  Those topics are going to be huge, so with a bit of tweaking to link the book to 9/11...\\" <br />Fair enough; writers have to live.  So here's Robin Morgan's 1989 book, reissued with a subtle title change and a few pages of post 9/11 stream-of-consciousness typing. But this book was already anachronistic in 1989. Most feminists had moved past the sloganeering of the 1970s, in which men and women were caricatured as (respectively) death-worshipping rapists with horrible yucky genitalia, and beautiful, loving, gentle, spiritual flower-beings. But Morgan's book was firmly a product of that mindset.  <br />So Morgan will tell you that the cause of terrorism is simpler than you think. \\"_The terrorist is the logical incarnation of patriarchal politics in a technological world._  The terrorist is the son practicing what the father has practiced, and claiming to have found his own identity in doing so.\\" [Italics in original.]  \\"The phallic malady is epidemic and systemic.\\"  <br />So the cause of terrorism is those dreadful humans with bollocks. Morgan's prose is also not un-bollockular. Try: \\"He [heterosexual men] knows that his actions are supported by the twin pillars of the State of man - the brotherhood ritual of political exigency and the brotherhood ritual of a sexual thrill in dominance. As a devotee of Thanatos, he is one with the practitioner of sado-masochistic 'play' between 'consenting adults,' as he is one with the rapist.\\"  <br />Some \\"devotees of Thanatos\\" and their partners and children may wonder what Thanatos is. It's Freud-speak for a supposed human death-drive, except that Morgan took Freud's fantasy a step further by declaring that \\"Thanatos\\" is exclusively male: Men are from Thanatos, women are from Eros.  <br/>Morgan's pop-Freudianism doesn't end there: sometimes a cigar is just a thrusting, phallic weapon.  Morgan reveals:  \\"The war toy, the rigid penetrating missiles, the dynamite and the blasting cap-these are at first only symbols of the message he must learn, fetishes of the ecstasy he is promised. But he must become them before he is rewarded with what the lack of ambivalence promises him: a frenzy, an excitement, an exhilaration-an orgasmic thrill in violent domination with which, he is taught, no act of lovemaking could possibly compete.\\"<br />But this feels wrong, as well as tiredly shallow. Does a suicide bomber really feel sexual about the cylindrical objects he, or she, straps to her, or his, body? Other mental processes, involving religion, politics, hate, cycles of revenge, seem more relevant, more causative, than Morgan's pop-Freudian phallus fixation.  Even in the 1980s, Morgan had to turn a blind eye to female terrorists like poster-girl Leila Khaled and others, whose actions were inconvenient facts Morgan dismissed as \\"tokens\\".  And since Morgan counts military action by male heads of state as terrorism, she also had to turn a blind eye to the military activities of such bellicose political leaders as Meyer, Thatcher, and Indira Ghandi, whose wars were recent history when Morgan was writing. But the current terrorist wave has brought a feminisation of terrorism; increasing numbers of women suicide bombers make Morgan's focus on willies as the root of terrorism now seem quaint.  <br />Morgan also claims that you can gauge a culture's potential for producing terrorists by assessing the status of women in that culture: the higher the status of women, the lower the potential for producing terrorist acts.  <br />But Morgan rightly condemns US Government agencies for sponsoring wars, dictatorships, terrorists, the overthrow of democracies, and so on, particularly in the 1950s through to the 1990s. (I'm leaving Afghanistan and Iraq out of this picture, with ambivalence, though Morgan wouldn't.)  But the status of women in the US is among the highest in the world.  Ditto France: supporting genocide in Africa, \\"Rainbow-Warrior-Boum!\\", etc, plus childcare.  While more patriarchal cultures like Thailand, Tonga, Switzerland, etc, produce somewhere between very little terrorism and none at all.  Of course patriarchy is an evil; it's just not the _only_ evil in the world.  <br />A more relevant distinction is between cultures that have universal, cheap, secular, education and those that don't.  If you won't fund decent education, plenty of bad people will be glad to fill the gap, teaching hate and terrorism.  There is certainly also a nexus between terrorism and the subjection of women, not only in relation to Islamism but strongly concentrated around Islamism.  But Morgan's shallow book is useless as a discussion of that nexus.  <br />There is one other problem with this book.  Morgan writes about men with enormous and unrelenting disdain: she has said that she thinks hating men is proper, and (as a joke, though she expressly denied that she was joking) that perhaps heterosexual men could help the world by ceasing to exist. Me, I don't really like being hated, especially on doctrinaire grounds by someone who doesn't even know me. That's just my vested interest, of course. Still, I can't help thinking the world has enough hatred, and that Morgan's own contribution in that regard is perhaps more part of the problem than part of the solution.         <br />Finally, there's the subtle title change.  The book was originally published as _The Demon Lover: The Sexuality of Terrorism_. The new edition is called _The Demon Lover: The Roots of Terrorism_.  <br />I can see why the original title had to go; in the English-speaking world, post 9/11, potential buyers might be irritated by Morgan's linkage of sexuality and terrorism, also the apparent implicit hint that terrorism is sexy. The new title makes the book sound more sensible, and for that reason it is a less accurate indication of the kind of book this is.  <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2003-06-28

But while the Western intellectual tradition may be a ramshackle old edifice, it's under no threat from this book, which has the demolitionary capacity of a handful of soggy noodles.<br />John Gray's book boils down to three assertions. The first is that western thought erred in considering humans significantly different from other animals. A nuanced claim might be reasonable: most religious traditions, all dualist<br />traditions, and some forms of rationalism have overemphasised humanity's uniqueness, and we should remember our close kinship with other animals. But Gray argues there are no important differences. A human city is no different, really, from a beehive, there's nothing special about human knowledge since even bacteria have \\"knowledge\\" (based on Gray's misunderstanding, one of many on matters scientific and historical, that bacterial movements imply \\"knowledge\\"), the internet is as natural as a spider's web, and so on.<br />If Gray meant that humans are part of nature so nothing we do is unnatural, he'd be right. Though only in a sense that makes the word \\"unnatural\\" meaningless. But he means more: that there is nothing remarkable or distinct, let alone impressive and admirable, about human achievements.<br />Let's test this by exploring Gray's equation of a spiderweb and the internet a bit further than Gray, who prefers making claims to examining them. We find that the internet and a spiderweb _are_ similar, in that if you draw a diagram of the internet to make it look like a spiderweb, then that diagram will look like a spiderweb. In other respects the comparison falls down.<br />For example a spiderweb is a one-spider operation, a trap to kill other animals, while the internet is a multi-user device by which many animals exchange information. Also, though Gray would rather slide over such distinctions, the spiderweb is an instinctive function of the spider, like (for example) a human's blink when a bright light flashes. Whereas the internet is, let's face it, an impressively clever and rather admirable artefact. Humanity can take a bow for the internet, though Gray won't be applauding.<br />Gray's second large claim is, in unacknowledged contradiction of his first claim, that humans are unique: it's just that we are uniquely horrible. We do war and genocide and ecocide, and that, Gray seems to think, is all we do. But I'm using a complex and beautiful human language (English) to interface via a keyboard with a computer, through which I can access trivia, silliness and pictures of other humans having sex, also poetry, paintings, philosophy and symphonies: a rich and not very murderous mixture.<br />Of course humans are flawed animals: in particular we need to stop giving political power to some of the worst of us. But in most places and most of the time most of us human animals are innocent: we bring up children, help each other, laugh, forgive, make art or love, and other good and inspiring things.<br />Gray's third large claim is that there is no hope and no meaning.  All philosophers are wrong, except perhaps the &uuml;berpessimist Schopenhauer; religion and science have both failed; humanism is only a decayed version of Christianity, and so on. But Gray's survey of philosophy is so shallow and selective, as is his outline of the human condition, that he cannot convince any reasonable person to indulge in his despair. The reality is that we do not know humanity's future: whether we will do well or badly.<br />For all Gray's claimed scepticism, his despair is more of a leap of faith than, for example, a cautious and conditional optimism. Moreover, while we don't know the future, we do know that despair is unlikely to bea productive or helpful response. That is, despair is not only intellectually shallow, at a practical level it is not only useless but harmful.<br />And Gray's claim that humanism is the ghost of Christianity is bad history. \\"Humanism\\" has had many meanings, but in its current incarnation as a non-theist ethics, it shares moral doctrines with Christianity, but they are older than Christianity. Ethical ideas common to humanism and Christianity, such as doing to others as you would be done by, the virtues of kindness, forbearance and forgiveness, and so on, all predate Christianity, and can be found in Confucius, Socrates, Seneca and countless others.<br />But moral doctrines specific to Christianity and the other monotheisms, such as intolerance of homosexuals and other deviants, subordination of women, the idea that people who don't believe in [insert name of religion] are worthy of eternal torture, and so on, are conspicuously absent in humanism. I wouldn't call myself a humanist, but Gray's account of humanism struck me as weirdly malicious and inaccurate. I suspect that Gray actually dislikes humanism for its intellectual and moral force, particularly in relation to Gray's moral nihilism, not its claimed lack of force.<br />Gray's essentially amoral despair is in a sense a product of belief rather than scepticism. That is, the idea that rejecting religion means rejecting all ethical ideas is essentially a religious idea, and not a product of post-religious thinking. In many respects Gray writes like a temporarily lapsed Catholic. _Straw Dogs_ shows signs of a \\"retreat into mysticism\\" phase; Gray's acceptance of Lovelock's \\"Gaia\\", Earth's supposedly intelligent and purposive biosphere, is one example of this, that sits oddly with his purported scepticism.<br />Finally, Gray's misanthropy and pessimism seem unconvincing, not just because they are not sustained by his arguments, but because I began to feel, as Gray's miserabilist pages wore on, that I was reading not so much a genuinely held position as a curmudgeonly pose.<br />Cheers indeed!<br />Laonbe a productive or helpful response.

US	50448822	R16NQA4GLSZQF7	1585673455	429992226	Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics	Books	5	16	20	N	N	State of the arts under Nazism	This is a thoroughly researched, and horribly fascinating, guide through the cultural interests and pretensions, and later the cultural policies, of Adolph Hitler.  Spotts takes us through Hitler's mix of boundless ambition and lack of talent in the visual arts, through his interest in music, and his fascination with architecture.  He outlines Hitler's attempt, once he'd gained power, to create a compliant community of artists in his nightmarish Reich, his efforts to get artists to produce what he wanted: the carefully controlled art-in-the-service-of-the-state, populist and uplifting, that Plato stipulated was the only kind of art that could be admitted into his Republic.  (Was Plato a precursor of Nazism?  Absolutely.  An influence?  Probably not.) <br />Though, as with any murderous tyrant, it pleased Hitler to grant indulgences.  He allowed some artists in the Third Reich to get away with defiance that would have had anyone else killed.  But these indulgences, Spotts observes, were not enough to inspire many of the artists who remained in Germany with anything approximating courage.  Musicians like Richard Strauss and Wilhelm Furtwängler made huge accommodations and moral compromises with the Reich, relying on pathetically miniscule gestures to salve their consciences.  <br />No-one who has not been in the same circumstances has the right to condemn them too easily, but at a time when extraordinary courage was called for they showed only human weakness.  Though Strauss composed _A Hero's Life_ and Furtwängler conducted it, neither lived it.  If we are tempted to believe that artists have special claims to virtue, or that interest in art is likely to lead a person towards virtue, then Spotts' book is an antidote for that sad illusion.  Spotts is rightly hard on those artists who, like Karajan in particular, helped put a civilised gloss on Nazi barbarism.<br />It has been objected that to focus on the arts in the Third Reich instead of, say, the war in Russia orthe Holocaust, is to trivialise the evil of Nazism.  That view is mistaken.  To focus on one part of a catastrophe where the horrors are more subtle is not to trivialise other, still more atrocious, aspects.  Instead it is to show how its distinctive and chilling lack of humanity pervaded every aspect of Nazism.  In focussing belated attention on the Third Reich's cultural politics, Spotts does not diminish our appreciation of the horror of fascism but enhances it.  <br />Some information in Spotts' book may provide unwelcome news for vested intellectual interests.  For example, Spotts exposes the rose-coloured portrait of Hitler in August Kubizek's _Adolf Hitler: Mein Judengfreund_ (\\"The Young Hitler I Knew\\"), showing it to be as fraudulent as the \\"Hitler\\" of Hermann Rauschning's imaginary dialogues.  Hitler apologists have long clung onto \\"Kubizek's book\\", with - from their point of view - good reason given Kubizek's romanticisation of the young Hitler, but Spotts makes it clear that \\"Kubizek's\\" book was merely a ghostwritten hoax.        <br />Another myth that is dying hard (though dying) is the one promoted by Köhler, Rose, Zelinsky et alia, claiming Hitler formed his political views and dreams out of composer Richard Wagner's operas and prose.  Spotts shows that Hitler was indeed impressed at a young age by Wagner's opera _Rienzi_.  But Hitler failed to note that in this early Wagnerian opera (Wagner himself dismissed _Rienzi_ as a \\"pecadillo of my youth\\") the Roman Tribune Rienzi becomes puffed up by the pride of his early successes, and is brought down by that unheeding arrogance. Rienzi fails to show compassion for those killed on either side, including his own, in Rome's brief civil war, preferring to spend his time and money on grand costumes and ceremonies, and he fails (eventually) to show mercy for those who fought against him.  As a direct result of these failings he is overthrown by the Roman people: Wagner's actual message was obvious.  It was Wagner's ill-luck that an evil lunatic, active a century after Wagner's opera was written, liked the sound his music made but failed to take note of his operas' meanings and messages.  <br />But Hitler did eventually get Wagner's message, Spotts reveals, finding Wagner unpalatable after the defeat at Stalingrad brought home the lesson taught in Wagner's _Ring_ cycle: that pursuit of power destroys love and leads to moral degradation and downfall.  From then Hitler could no longer bear to listen to Wagner, and in his last years turned instead to the schmaltzy operettas of Franz Lehar.  There was no such person as \\"Wagner's Hitler\\", Spotts concludes; to Hitler, Wagner was only an opera composer.  As an aside, Spotts noted that, Hitler excepted, the Nazi Party as a whole preferred Beethoven.  <br />It would have been good to see more on the Reich's use of radio and film.  Spotts hardly touches on Leni Riefenstahl's films, nor on films by other Nazi directors with similar amounts of artistic ambition, or pretension, but none of Riefenstahl's regrettable talent.  The theatre under the Third Reich is also only barely covered.  But in its central fields - music, painting and sculpture, and architecture including the abstract art of the autobahns - Spotts is comprehensive and authoritative.   <br />Finally, it's important to note that Spotts is not being quite as ambitious as the book's blurb might suggest.  Spotts does not \\"explain\\" Hitler, still less explain him away, by showing the extent of his artistic interests, and of his artistic disappointment.  He writes only about one aspect of the great \\"catastrophe\\" (as Spotts called Hitler), but an aspect that contains considerable illumination on the whole.    <br />Spotts provides a great deal of valuable information and insight on the arts in Hitler's Germany, with much that is (so far as I can tell) new and - mirabile dictu! - authoritative and reliable.  <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2003-03-05
US	50448822	RAEC6ZXF2A0L5	0837186641	267478384	The Young Hitler I Knew	Books	1	66	105	N	N	Just another hoax: compare with Kubizek's actual own words	This book is especially valued by Hitler apologists, for its rose-coloured portrait of the young F&uuml;hrer as an intelligent aesthete and visionary, a patriot who showed unusual leadership qualities from adolescence.  But actually it's just another of the many Hitler hoaxes.<br />As outlined in Frederic Spotts' _Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics_ (2002), available from Amazon.com, in 1938 the Nazis commissioned August Kubizek to write about his youth with Hitler.  However Kubizek eventually reported to a party official that \\"writing is a horrible burden; it is not something I can do.\\"  In 1943 Hitler himself gave Kubizek a one-off payment and a monthly stipend to try to get him to produce at least something.  By 1944 or 1945 Kubizek had managed to produce two short booklets, jointly called the \\"Reminiscences\\".  But by then it was too late for the \\"Reminiscences\\" to be published by the Nazis; he hid them until after the war.<br />In 1948 Kubizek complained that his booklets should really be in the hands of a \\"real writer\\". Clearly he found his \\"real writer\\" because in 1953 this book was published.  Though published under Kubizek's name it is clearly not by Kubizek, both on style grounds (this professionally written book of 350 pages is not by the Kubizek who took six-seven years to produce two crudely written booklets) and because of discrepancies between this book and Kubizek's \\"Reminiscences\\".<br />For example Kubizek's \\"Reminiscences\\" gave just two direct quotes from Hitler, both brief.  But the published book is full of long Hitlerian speeches. The Hitler speeches had always struck me as literary creations: they are not the sort of thing that people, even crazed adolescents, actually say.  However I had assumed that at least the speeches were invented by someone who really had known Hitler.  Since it is now clear that the words put into Hitler's mouth were not written by Kubizek but by a ghostwriter, they don't even have that approximate kind of verisimilitude.<br />In Kubizek's \\"Reminiscences\\" Hitler was already viciously antisemitic in 1907.  In this ghostwritten book Hitler was hardly antisemitic at all.  Kubizek wrote while the Third Reich's racial policies were still in force, so it would flatter Hitler to say that he had already acquired his antisemitism as a youth.  But the ghostwriter was presenting Hitler for a post-war audience, so Hitler's antisemitism had to be toned down to make him more palatable.<br />The ghostwriter gives Hitler a romance with a girl called \\"Stefanie\\", presumably to counter rumours about Hitler's sexuality.  \\"Stefanie\\" isn't in Kubizek's \\"Reminiscences.\\"<br />The ghostwriter's identity is unknown.  The original publishers denied that they fabricated the book (after an accusation by historian Brigit Hamann).  I suspect a Nazi loyalist who knew Kubizek from the old days, perhaps a writer from the old Reichspropaganda-Ministerium.  Emery Reeves, who ghostwrote Rauschning's _Hitler Speaks_ hoax and at least one other such \\"memoir\\", was arguably a rascal but certainly an anti-Nazi, and would not have touched this book.<br /><br />Moving to the arts, the ghostwriter (unlike Kubizek) has Hitler adore Mendelssohn's violin concerto.  Hitler as Mendelssohn fan?  And the ghostwriter has Kubizek and Hitler attending _Parsifal_ together at Vienna in 1907.  Trevor Ravenscroft made the same mistake in his Hitler hoax _The Spear of Destiny_.  Ravenscroft, like Kubizek's ghostwriter, forgot that Bayreuth still had exclusive rights to _Parsifal_, which was not actually performed in Vienna until 1914, by which time Kubizek had long since lost contact with Hitler.<br />The book has Hitler avidly reading Dante, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Goethe, etc, also Wagner's essays, something often cited by people claiming Hitler was interested in Wagner's ideas instead of just his music.  But Kubizek's \\"Reminiscences\\" contradict this: Kubizek states that Hitler read _nothing_ serious or intellectual at this time (not that he'd have liked Wagner's essays if he'd read them, but that's another issue).  Similarly, the book has an elaborate chapter about Hitler writing a Wagnerian opera: so do the _Reminiscences_, but in 1938 Kubizek told a party official that Hitler had attempted a _play_, not an _opera_.<br />The famous anecdote about Hitler seeing a performance of _Rienzi_ and being inspired to lead Germany, and 30 years later dramatically intoning, \\"In that hour it began\\" is a great story, which no-one has been able to resist.  No-one except Kubizek himself, who oddly mentions no such thing in his \\"Reminiscences\\".  (Kubizek referred to a memorable night after the 17-year old Hitler was deeply stirred by a performance of _Rienzi_; the ghostwriter contributed the rest.  _Rienzi_ really did impress the adolescent Hitler: but discussion of the significance of this, if any, must be based on Speer's less melodramatic remarks on the topic.  In reality Hitler's involvement in politics began more than a decade later, in the aftermath not of an opera performance but of World War I and an economic depression.)<br />Basically, Kubizek's real \\"Reminiscences\\" have some historical value, though even they must be treated with caution: Kubizek wanted to present a favourable picture of Hitler, also himself, and punched up his stories for publication (though not as much as his ghostwriter did).  But this book does not follow the \\"Reminiscences\\" and was not written by Kubizek: therefore it has no value except as reasonably well-written fiction, thus earning the compulsory one star. It's true that Kubizek didn't disown the ghostwritten book, but why would he? It gave him fame and money, and helped re-polish his hero Hitler's reputation.  It's clear, from the way that the book repeatedly contradicts Kubizek's own written account without protest from Kubizek, that Kubizek was not concerned with its \\"truth\\".<br />As with Rauschning/Reeves' _Hitler Speaks_ hoax, some things in the book attributed to Kubizek may be true, but the only things that can be accepted are those that are independently confirmed from other sources that appear to be reliable. It's like having a demagnetised compass that sometimes happens to point north, but you can only know when it is reading true if you compare it with another compass: ie, it's useless.

The destruction of democracy, the German conquest of most of Europe in pursuit of a dream of world domination, the mass murders of European Jews, the whole Third Reich: all Wagner's idea.   <br />Really?  Let's see. Overthrow of democracy?  Wagner supported constitutional monarchy, with political parties of \\"men with equal rights\\"; the monarch to stay above politics and ensure stability. His essay _State and religion_ is clear enough. <br />German conquest of Europe, and world domination?  Wagner's _What is German?_ specifically condemns German attempts at military conquest, saying that German culture and polity never prospers when Germans rule other peoples.<br />The Holocaust?  Wagner's most antisemitic essay, _Jewishness in Music_, calls on German Jews to abandon their separate culture and assimilate into German culture.  That's racist, but did it influence Hitler?  Since Hitler preferred racial segregation followed by extermination, it would seem not.  Nor could Hitler have been comfortable with Wagner's opposition to the rule of one \\"race\\" by another, nor his suggestion that Europeans get used to racial intermingling (_Heroism and Christianity_).  Meantime Köhler ignores the mainstream antisemites of Wagner's day, who really did influence Nazi racial policies. <br />(Wagner privately made some loathsome antisemitic remarks to Cosima Wagner, who duly recorded them in her diaries for Köhler to make the most of.  But they weren't published till after Hitler's death, and for other reasons can't have been an influence.) <br />Look up \\"Wagner\\" in the indexes of Hitler's books and speeches, and accounts of his conversation by Speer and other eyewitnesses, and you find, despite Köhler's picture of an \\"obsessed\\" Hitler, that Hitler hardly ever mentioned Wagner.  Köhler even admits this, but claims - seriously - that it's part of a conspiracy to hide Wagner's posthumous puppet-mastery.  But Hitler never once referred to Wagner's ideas or essays, only to music.  Hitler didn't even find Wagner's antisemitism interesting or important enough to mention.  <br />It's clear that Wagner's influence on Hitler is essentially the same, that is, emotionally intense with without intellectual content, as his influence on Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism.  Both men were passionate Wagnerians.  Herzl loved Wagner's music, regularly attending Wagner operas and concerts for inspiration and renewal while he wrote Zionism's founding texts.  But that doesn't make Wagner the founder of Israel. Hitler likewise loved the music but showed little interest in Wagner's ideas. <br />Köhler deals with these intractable realities in five ways: <br />1 Make stuff up<BR>Here's Köhler describing Hitler in the bunker, 1945: \\"As the outside world disintegrated, it was to his inner world ... that Hitler turned ... Like a film projected onto the screen of his consciousness, he was suddenly gripped by a vision\\".  Köhler then describes Hitler's \\"vision\\", which turns out to be about Wagner and to support Köhler's thesis.  But no source mentions this \\"vision\\".  Köhler seems to have invented it because the historical record wouldn't give him what he needed.  There are many other examples.<br />2 Footnote fakery<BR>Though the book is festooned with footnotes, they only add credibility if you don't look them up.  For example that \\"vision\\" passage is footnoted, but follow it up and you won't find a source.  Instead it says that an irrelevant phrase Köhler threw into the passage echoes words Hitler used in 1936.  Soon after, Köhler describes a 1944 meeting between Hitler and Wagner's grandson Wieland, with Hitler dismissing Wieland's claim to Wagner's manuscript scores \\"over supper\\".  Follow up the footnote and you find that no meeting took place.  A little further Köhler alleges that Hitler's words \\"The people will not tolerate any act of clemency\\", in relation to the murders after the Reichstag fire, are \\"taken almost literally from _Rienzi_\\".  The footnote directs you, rather vaguely, to Act II, which I have just checked in vain for those words or anything like them.  And so on.  <br />3 Twisting words <BR>Köhler's quotes from Wagner tend to give only two to perhaps ten words at a time, wrenched from context and ascribed sinister meanings.  Thus Köhler describes Hitler's \\"orgies of killings in dark, secret places ... `in the bosom of darkness and death', as Wagner once put it.\\" But check \\"in the bosom of darkness and death\\" back to the source and you nothing whatsoever to do with \\"orgies of killing\\": Wagner meant \\"caves\\".  This is no occasional slip-up; it is systematic.  Almost all Köhler's Wagner quotes are twisted in this way.  <br />4    Irrelevancy <BR>Köhler's deceptiveness on that non-meeting between Wieland and Hitler is odd, because Wagner's grandson's access or non-access to Hitler in 1944 is irrelevant.  Some of Wagner's descendants and their partners supported the Nazis, some went along, and some defied them.  Köhler spends much of the book showing that some Wagner descendants were contemptible, but the Wagner Köhler wants to arraign was then long dead and gone.  <br />5   The big lie<BR>Sometimes Köhler just lets rip, and it's breath-taking.  Try this, about the _Ring_: \\"The gods in Valhalla had ordained that the destruction of their `deadly enemy' must precede the age of the `master race'.\\" That would certainly be damning, if true, but instead it's bizarre nonsense.  Other claims, especially about the operas, are similarly fantastic.  <br />There's much more, shonky chronology, dodgy sources, etc, but I'm out of space.  Of course there's much to condemn about Wagner, but that's no excuse for fabrication.  This is a bad book, partly for untruth concerning a flawed man, mainly for its evasion of the actual historical persons and forces that led to Nazism, the Holocaust and attendant horrors.  Neither the far-right political parties, unions and associations, nor the antisemitic Christian right groups, nor the opportunistic business backers, nor the street thugs behind Nazism and neo-Nazism cared then, nor care now, a hoot about opera. <br />Misdirection like Köhler's not only tries to cede to Nazis a cultural treasure that they do not deserve, but by obscuring the actual historical origins of Nazism it gives comfort to those who deserve none.  <br />Cheers! <br />Laon	2002-02-05
US	50448822	R312U29K90XR57	1902210522	357705212	The Ring of Myths: The Israelis, Wagner and the Nazis	Books	5	30	30	N	N	A fascinating history of a cultural battle	At a controversial Israel Festival concert on 7 July 2000, the Berlin Staatskapelle Orchestra under the baton of Daniel Barenboim played music by a passionate antisemite with Fascist tendencies.  <br />After that they played some Wagner.  <br />Ironies abounded that night.  The concert was planned as an all-Wagner night: a Jewish conductor leading a German orchestra playing German music in Jerusalem would provide fine symbolism for a night of reconciliation.  Instead rightwing Israeli politicians intervened: threats were made to Festival funding, pressure was applied.  The result?  The music of one antisemitic composer was replaced with the music of two antisemitic composers, Schumann and Stravinsky.  Schumann, like Wagner, died long before Nazism existed.  But the antisemitic Stravinsky met privately with Mussolini, calling him \\"the hope of Italy and of Europe\\", wrote to assure the Nazis that he was of pure Aryan stock, and abandoned dealings with Jewish conductors and musicians in order to conform to Nazi sensibilities.  Still, it was only when Barenboim played Wagner, after the Stravinsky, that controversy erupted.  <br />Na'ama Sheffi's _The Ring of Myths: The Israelis, Wagner and the Nazis_ provides a guide through some of these ironies and puzzles. How, for example, can politicians think that imposing political control on what artists can play is an anti-Nazi act?  And why did they select a composer who died long before Nazism existed but despised Nazism's political ancestors, who became a pacifist opposing German military spending and writing that Germany loses its soul when it tries to rule other nations, who condemned slavery and the exploitation of one \\"race\\" by another, who wrote works showing that the pursuit of power leads to evil and self-destruction, whose opera _Parsifal_ was banned by the Nazis, who also asked that the _Ring_ not be performed as a cycle, and performances of whose works actually declined under the Nazis?  <br />Sheffi reveals that the ban was a historical accident: in 1938 the Palestine Orchestra (principally made up of Jews from Eastern Europe) protested against Kristallnacht by dropping the _Meistersinger_ overture from their next concert.  The gesture was hurried but not unreasonable: the Nazis used _Die Meistersinger_ for propaganda purposes, as they misappropriated other German music and art, Beethoven, Bruckner, Goethe and Rembrandt in particular.  But the scheduled concert after Kristalnacht had had Wagner on the program, so it was against Wagner in particular that the gesture was made.  The Palestine Orchestra played Wagner again after that one-off cancellation (though in Cairo, not Jerusalem), but with the war's end and the creation of the state of Israel, the precedent of a musical boycott had been set. <br />Since then, Sheffi argues, Wagner has been built, in Israel, into a symbol of the holocaust, a symbol with little relationship to the actual historical personage, who, she observes, \\"did not devote his life to denigrating Jews and certainly not to annihilating them.\\"  The Israeli ban endorses the Nazi's malicious misreadings of Wagner; thus it remains a homage rather than a repudiation of Nazi cultural thought.  A genuine rejection of Nazi ideas necessarily involves dismissing their claim to Wagner, just as the Nazi uses and misreadings of Goethe's _Faust_ (Faust as the German soul; Mephistopheles as corrupting Jew) are now remembered only to be dismissed with contempt.  <br />Sheffi argues that the danger in using Wagner as Holocaust symbol and shorthand for Nazism is not only that it perpetuates a falsehood.  Worse, it directs attention away from the individuals, political groups and social forces that really created and operated the Holocaust.  The ban on Wagner \\"facilitated the obliteration of the true essence of the Holocaust from the Israeli collective memory ... From a man of culture and learning, problematic though his views were, [Wagner] became a man identified with theHolocaust; whereas the real threats of the past - not only extremist nationalism, racism, and systematic murder, but the enormous inherent danger to democracy - all became slogans, at best.\\"  <br />The real Wagner and his works, Sheffi argues, is being inappropriately used as a weapon in a cultural war within Israel.  \\"Eventually the musical dispute proved to be only part of the general cultural clash in Israel, a clash reflected primarily in a fierce controversy over the cultural character of the state.  Certain sectors - the Orthodox and national-religious Jews - began to perceive the desire to play Wagner's music as an attempt to Westernize Israeli culture while obliterating its original Hebrew Jewish identity.\\"    <br />Sheffi's explication of these themes, and her tracing of the history of this debate, ranges through 60-odd years of Israeli cultural and political history, and is considerably more subtle and nuanced than this review's brief outline can reveal.  Israeli politics are both labyrinth and minefield, and the clarity of Sheffi's guidance through the twists and turns is something the reader can both admire and be grateful for.  <br />Sheffi does not know her Wagner quite as well as she knows Israel, however.  For example she is too credulous in relation to the various readings of antisemitic meanings into Wagner works, the Wagnerian equivalent of proofs that Bacon wrote Shakespeare.  She also commits occasional solecisms like, \\"Wagner had been on close terms with his son-in-law.\\"  That \\"son-in-law\\" is Houston Stewart Chamberlain, a man who once saw Wagner from a distance, but who Wagner never met or even heard of.  Chamberlain's involvement with Wagner's pathetic offspring began well after Wagner's death.  Here Sheffi has fallen into the trap of trusting some of the makers of the \\"Ring of Myths\\" of her title, who tend to fudge the distance between Wagner and Chamberlain because Chamberlain really did contribute to Nazi ideology, which makes it temptingto place Chamberlain, falsely, in Wagner's Bayreuth circle.  Obviously Sheffi sometimes relied on secondary sources, and in Wagner studies, where certain secondary sources are not exactly committed to truth and accuracy, that's fatal.  <br />But those are quibbles.  This is a thoughtful, generally well-researched and referenced book, clearly written, and showing alertness to nuances of meaning in a field where attention to nuance is a rare commodity.<br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2002-02-03
US	50448822	R23MVB2NCUYCDT	0345391691	920269539	The Battle for God	Books	2	90	136	N	N	Rose-colored spectacular: naive, woolly, unreliable	The most influential form of religious fundamentalism today is Islamic: Wahhabism.  Wahhabism is named for Muhammed ibn al-Wahhab (1703-1792), who advocated killing those who did not follow strict Islam, including the Turkish sultans but also the unfortunates who came under his rule.  Wahhabism is fiercely anti-intellectual, intolerant and violent.  <br />Today Wahhabism is preached in mosques, taught in Islamic schools, and funded by governments and &quot;figures close to government&quot; in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in particular (both dictatorships remain US clients, even after September 2001).  It has been increasingly active in the past three decades in the Caucasus, Somalia, Yemen, the former Yugoslavia (where it should be remembered that the worst atrocities were committed by Christians, not Muslims), and in atrocities in Kashmir, the Philippines, Indonesia, Egypt and elsewhere.  And of course in New York.<br />Karen Armstrong's book covers Judaic, Christian and Muslim fundamentalism, but in _Battle for God_'s 442 pages, Wahhab himself is mentioned once and Wahhabism four times, in passing.  That the book was written before September 2001 is no excuse: the rise and danger of Wahhabism had been obvious for decades.  To practically omit it from her account of fundamentalism seems more than ordinary carelessness.  <br />So why this omission (and there are many others)?  First, Karen Armstrong seems a nice person but not an outstandingly clear thinker.  She exhibits a tendency to think reality is what one hopes it will be.  Thus, she would like to think that Islamic fundamentalists aren't so bad really, that &quot;jihad&quot; is really a sort of internal struggle to become a better person: so she says its so.  (Its disingenuous to claim that the more warlike connotation of jihad is only a Western misunderstanding.  Armstrong on jihad is like someone who stresses the purity symbolised by the Ku Klux Klan's white robes, hoping people will focus onthe spiritual rhetoric and overlook the ropes and guns.)  <br />Second, while Armstrong does acknowledge the murderousness of much religious fundamentalism, my impression is that the unreasoning, utterly committed, faith of the various fundamentalisms appeals to her.  She argues for a rapprochement between the secular world and the world of the fundamentalists.  She sees the spiritual passion of fundamentalists as something that can add meaning to what she thinks is the aridity or &quot;meaninglessness&quot; of secular thought.  <br />Perhaps.  In the same way that giving moral authority to Nazis could be said to add fervour and passion to political life.  It seems more credible to think of giving moral authority to religious fundamentalists (including some though not most strands of Christian fundamentalism) in terms of death: the death of freedom, most art, and many other good human things, obviously, but also the deaths of many, many, many people.      <br />Armstrong clearly cannot think outside her own religious background.  For example she assumes that monotheism is the &quot;highest&quot; form of religious belief, a product of advanced cultures to which all other kinds of religion led.  But by any reasonable standards the cultures that produced the Greek and Roman polytheisms (and their literature, art, politics and jurisprudence) was more advanced than the tribes who eventually killed off the other gods in their pantheon and worshipped YHWH alone.  And her YHWH/Allah/Adonai-centric view is insulting to Hindus, the voters in the world's most populous democracy, and to other polytheists, and animists.<br />Her inability to think outside monotheism means that it never occurs to her to consider one of the most crucial questions in this context.  Religion does not drive animists or polytheists to kill, not on the vast scale of the monotheist religions.  Instead of congratulating monotheists for their &quot;culture&quot;, Armstrong should have asked: Why is it that the monotheist religions are so peculiarly murderous? <br />Nor does she consider the logic of fundamentalism.  Armstrong rejects fundamentalist beliefs because they do not lead to a particularly nice worldview.  Indeed.  But from the neutrality of atheism, it does not seem obvious to me that fundamentalism is bad religion.  Fundamentalists follow their religions sacred text.  If decent people dont like the conclusions that literal interpretation of a sacred text leads to, that is surely the fault of the texts, not of fundamentalists.  <br />And if religion is a submission of ones will and mind to a supposed higher power, fundamentalists are logical in advocating complete rather than partial submission.  After all, anyone who decides for themself which bits of the Bible, Koran etc to take literally is placing their own judgement over the words of the text.  And once a person has acknowledged that their own judgement is a better guide to truth and decency than their religions sacred book, why bother with the book at all?  Fundamentalists can argue that their worldview is not only better faith than less literal belief, but also more intellectually coherent.  But Armstrong merely assumes that fundamentalists offer a perversion of religion.  <br />As well as woolly thinking and the hiding of inconvenient facts (that won't stay under the rug, post September 11), Armstrongs book offers unreliability on detail.  One reviewer noted, credibly, that her account of Bahai is inaccurate.  With some interest in science, I was first jolted by a serious reference to Carl Jungs nonsense about mandalas and archetypes, then by an uncritical assertion that Freud had discovered the death instinct.  No wonder Armstrong thinks so little of science that she views fundamentalism with rose-coloured spectacles; she hasnt a clue where science has been in the last 50 years, or what scientific thinking is.  Not to know that Freudsthanatos, or death instinct, went the way of phlogiston decades ago is truly extraordinary.  <br />By page 300 Id stopped trusting Armstrongs selection of facts, and I wont quote facts she presents without independent confirmation.  That makes this book nearly useless to me.  I wanted a good overview of the historical origins of fundamentalism, its intellectual background, and a survey of where the fundamentalisms are at now, including the dangers they pose.  Im still looking.  <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2002-01-13

I noted Gutman's unreliability then, but on re-reading I can only report that my opinion of Gutman has fallen further. I originally awarded it two stars; I now think that was generous.<br />This book is more careless of source material than any book has right to be, but it's not ordinary carelessness.  All errors and misstatements happen to support Gutman's case for a proto-Nazi Wagner.  When a book's errors all support one thesis, that pattern must raise questions not just of competence but also of integrity.<br />For example Gutman claims Wagner was &quot;sympathetic&quot; to proto-Nazi Bernhard F&ouml;rster's attempted German community in Paraguay.  But Cosima's Diaries show that Wagner held F&ouml;rster in general and the South American project in particular in contempt.  Why this &quot;mistake&quot;?  Because it suits Gutman's thesis.<br />Or take Wagner's late essays.  If you read the essays themselves rather than Gutman's profoundly dishonest exegesis, you find a man wrestling with his own racism.<br />In _Heroism and Christianity_, for example, Wagner does take it as a given that white people are superior to other &quot;races&quot;.  Wagner, like many other European and American artists, was the product of a racist culture and it is unhistorical to pretend otherwise.  But then Wagner writes that although people find the idea of the commingling of all human &quot;races&quot; into &quot;a uniform equality&quot; distressing, this is because of their cultural blinkers. &quot;It is only looking at it through the reek of our own civilisation and culture than makes this picture so repellant,&quot; he says.<br />Christianity, Wagner continues, is superior to other religions because it is aimed equally at all &quot;races&quot; while Judaism and Brahminism, for example, include noble ideas but are aimed at only one &quot;race&quot; or caste.  Although (he writes) it is &quot;natural&quot; [meaning &quot;likely to occur in nature&quot;] for strong &quot;races&quot; to rule weaker &quot;races&quot;, the rule of one &quot;race&quot; by another has led to &quot;exploitation&quot; and an &quot;utterly immoral system&quot;. Wagner's answer is equality of all &quot;races&quot; under &quot;a universal moral concord&quot;, something Wagner suggests that Christian doctrines could bring about.  (Wagner was not a Christian, but in later life admired Christian rituals and doctrines.)<br />The essay is not enlightened by modern standards, but in its historical context it stands as Wagner's rejection of the proto-Nazi ideas of his own day.  Gutman's systematic distortions are regrettable not just because they go beyond mere inaccuracy but also because they are much less interesting than the truth.<br />A passage recently cited as an example of Gutman's merits provides another example of Gutman's method:<br />&quot;Monsalvat was Wagner's paranoiac concept of a small self-contained elite group, uniquely possessed of the truth, obsessed with its 'purity,' and struggling with an outside world it held worthless. Redemption was promised the hard-pressed knights, but, obviously, the Wagnerian redeemer was not to be found among Jewish craftsmen or lepers. Not by accident did Guernemanz almost immediately remark upon Parsifal's noble, highborn appearance. He knew what signs to read. Racial heredity and strict breeding, not natural selection, formed the new mechanism of salvation. Wagnerian eugenics had come into being; in his latest writing the composer had embraced the darker implications of Darwinism.&quot;<br />Problems?  First, Gutman misses the way _Parsifal_ shows Montsalvat critically and ironically (our first glimpse is of its watchmen sleeping on the job), as a damaged community that fails to live up to its ideals.  An example is the knights' and squires' rejection of Kundry as Outsider, a moral fault for which the saintly G&uuml;rnemantz, clearly Wagner's mouthpiece, reproves them.<br />Second, the reference to &quot;Jewish craftsmen and lepers&quot; is Gutman's invention. Neither are mentioned, let alone disparaged, in _Parsifal_.<br />Third, Gutman must know that the remark on the hero's &quot;noble appearance&quot; is standard in Wagner's source material, and referred not so much to race as to &quot;gentle upbringing&quot;, meaning having &quot;courtly&quot; deportment as opposed to the gestures and manners of a peasant.  Example?  In Wagner main source, von Eschenbach's _Parzifal_, similar observations are made about Parzifal's half-brother Fierafiz, whose mother was black.<br />Fourth, the Montsalvat community is not &quot;self-contained&quot;.  Wagner's text mentions that Gawain is a member of the Montsalvat community, though that character is also a member of Arthur's court.  And Gawain, like the other Montsalvat knights, spends as much or more time out in the world than at Montsalvat.<br />Fifth, Montsalvat's alleged &quot;racial hereditary and strict breeding&quot; is more Gutmanian invention.  Not only does _Parsifal_ not contain any such idea, or anything remotely like it, but Wagner's text rules out the possibility.  G&uuml;rnemantz tells us that Montsalvat was founded by Titurel, who has had one adult child and is still alive when the opera begins.  G&uuml;rnemantz was also a founding Montsalvat member.  &quot;Breeding program&quot;?  When?  Instead the Montsalvat community must have grown through that bugbear even of modern racists: immigration.  Some of Montsalvat's knights and squires may be children of original members, but that's hardly a breeding program.  (By the way, Wagner's Montsalvat is in Spain.  Not Germany.)<br />Can a passage so densely inaccurate be the product of mere carelessness?  I think not.<br />Actually Gutman misses an intriguing possibility about Parsifal's ancestry. Parsifal comes from \\"Arabia\\".  His father Gamuret was probably Welsh or Cornish, but we are told that Herzeleide was pregnant with Parsifal when Gamuret was in \\"Arabia\\".  Since knights didn't take wives with them on crusade, the implication is that Gamuret met Herzeleide in \\"Arabia\\".  (Wagner's text concerning Herzeleide differs significantly from his sources.)  It's amusing in this context to consider that Wagner's Parsifal may have been what the media is currently calling \\"of Mid-Eastern appearance\\", and quite ineligible for the Hitler Youth.  Still, the Nazi thing is Gutman's obsession, not Wagner's.  Oh, and far from loving _Parsifal_, as Gutman would have you believe, the truth is that the Nazis banned it.<br />In short, Gutman's &quot;first casualty&quot; wasn't Wagner, but truth. An irresponsibly unreliable book.<br />Cheers!<br />Laonproves them. <br />Second, the reference to &quot;Jewish craftsmen and lepers&quot; is Gutman's invention.

US	50448822	RFU5ADB4X0Q0I	1860742289	463950953	He Who Does Not Howl with the Wolf	Books	1	6	7	N	N	Same book as _Twilight of the Wagners_: avoid!	Some people may be puzzled by finding this autobiographical book by Gottfried Wagner as well as his equally autobiographical _Twilight of the Wagners_.  Has Gottfried Wagner actually managed to squeeze two books out of his horrible childhood and other misfortunes?  No, he's written only one, but published two.  This and _Twilight_ are the same book with a different title.  <br />Basically this book is an ill-written mix of self-exculpation and petulance by a man with three misfortunes: <BR>* An apparently loveless upbringing that left him angrily resentful against his father; <BR>* A famous last name, so that his embarrassing adolescent whining about this sad upbringing got published (twice!) when if he had had any other name no-one would have thought it worth the effort of typesetting; <BR>* A genius for an ancestor and no talent himself, so that he has felt constrained to work in the arts though this is a field for which he is plainly not suited and in which he appears to be unhappy.  <br />His lack of talent is clear both from the accounts of failure after failure which Gottfried blames on conspiracies directed against him from Bayreuth, and from the abysmal quality of his writing.  <br />Currently Gottfried is working on a reconcilation project between the children of Jews who suffered or died under Hitler's Germany, and the children of Germans who were alive during the Nazi years.  That seems a worthy project and it should be wished well, but it doesn't save this from being an embarrassingly bad book.  <br />There's nothing of value here about Richard Wagner.  Gottfried's occasional comments on his great ancestor's antisemitism contain no new information, while his very occasional comments on the works are astonishingly ill-informed.  I don't mean &quot;I disagree with them&quot;; I mean that, surprisingly, they don't suggest even basic familiarity with the works he occasionally comments on.  With neither insight nor accuracy, the value of Gottfried's occasional obita dicta on the only Wagner that counts is zero.    <br />Other Wagner family books are available: Gottfried's cousin, Nike Wagner, has recently written a book on Richard Wagner which is clearly a thinly-disguised job application for taking over the Bayreuth Festival: I don't always agree with her thoughts on Wagner, but at least she knows the works and has thought about them, and therefore has some interesting things to say.  But Nike has managed to get on with her life, and carve out a moderately successful directing career, despite being persona non grata at Bayreuth just like Gottfried.  (I would probably favour artistic direction at Bayreuth being taken over by someone like Barenboim, but from the book it seems it could do worse than Nike Wagner.)<br />Finally, one book has been written by a Wagner who was in one sense a worthy descendent of the great Richard: his granddaughter Friedelinde.  <br />Friedelinde Wagner was an adolescent in the Nazi years, and was disgusted when the senior Wagners feted Hitler (who, she observed, wanted the social cachet that Bayreuth gave him, but talked and plotted in his box throughout the Bayreuth Wagner performances he attended; his interest was in the live Wagners and their social status, she suggests, not in the dead composer.)  Friedelinde eventually escaped to Switzerland, finishing up in the United States, where she helped the OSS (predecessor of the CIA) with intelligence information concerning Hitler and the other Nazi thugs who hung around Bayreuth, and wrote anti-Nazi propaganda.  Given Richard Wagner's contempt for the proto-Nazis of his own day (Stoecker, Förster and others) he would have approved of Friedelinde, but not of his more craven descendents.  <br />Memo to publishers: Let's not bother republishing Gottfried's whine under yet another title: instead, let's give us a reprint of Friedelinde Wagner's much more interesting book, _Shadow over Bayreuth_.   <br />Memo to readers: in the meantime, read Nike'sbook instead: it's flawed but has some merit, while Gottfried's book, however titled, is pretty much a merit-free zone. <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2001-12-24

There's even a moment where the author fantasises my extermination: he describes the body of a white intellectual who rejected notions of racial solidarity, swinging from a rope attached to a streetlight.  That's me and my kind, right there. <br />Funnily enough, I also get exterminated in Mary Daly's _Quintessence_.   So do all my women friends, though they even use the &quot;feminist&quot; word despite the damage done to that word's reputation by Daly, Dworkin and others.  <br />Why extermination?  Because, it seems, we are &quot;snools&quot;, in Daly's bizarre jargon, because we reserve the right to criticise ideas that don't make sense, &quot;phallocrats&quot; because we support democracy instead of Daly's &quot;gynocracy&quot;, &quot;necrophiles&quot; because we think science and technology are on the whole good things, without being uncritical about their use.  My women friends' feminism is different from Daly's, so they are &quot;totalled women&quot; and &quot;fembots&quot;.  <br />Note how many of Daly's &quot;dis/covered words&quot; express hatred, from &quot;snool&quot; to &quot;snot boy&quot;.  And Daly's writing is shockingly bad, a mix of cutesie neologisms - &quot;crone-logical&quot;, &quot;be-witching&quot; etc - in praise of an elect of lesbian separatists, along with name-calling abuse of her enemies, almost the entire &quot;man-infested&quot; human species.  As Daly's outcasts, we probably wouldn't want to live in the mindless and passionless utopia Daly prescribes and describes in _Quintessence_, but that's okay, because Daly wants us dead.   <br />In the following quote, a sample from _Quintessence'_s holocaust fantasy, Daly's narrator, &quot;I&quot;, is &quot;Anonyma&quot;, a Mary Daly fan from 50 years in the future, who has brought Daly forward in time to survey the world her books brought about: <br />&quot; &quot;Are there men andboys on the other continents?&quot; [Mary] asked.<br />&quot;Yes,&quot; I said. &quot;But ... the world today is Gynocratic and Gynocentric. ... The Earth's transformation has required that her inhabitants grow through profound psychic changes. Those who were not able to grow could not endure in the purity and strength of the New energy field...&quot;<br />&quot;Are you saying that men who insisted on clinging to patriarchal beliefs and behaviors became obsolete and 'died off'?&quot; asked Mary.<br />&quot;Yes, they rapidly became extinct,&quot; I said.<br />&quot;And what became of the patriarchally assimilated women who identified with the roles and rules of patriarchy?&quot; asked Mary.<br />I answered, &quot;Those women who refused to release themselves from the phallocratic dependencies and habits that had been embedded in them under the old system were in effect refusing to evolve. So they also could not survive in the New energy field.&quot; &quot;  [End quote.]<br />So only a few male survivors, and since &quot;patriarchal beliefs and behaviours&quot; turn out to include heterosexuality, interest in science, rationality and various other thought-crimes and desire-crimes, that's most women dead too.  So much death, without the slightest tinge of regret in Daly's prose: who's the necrophile?  <br />Daly says our extermination occurs in the next 50 years, so it is not caused by our failure to reproduce while Daly's parthenogenic lesbians flourish and thrive: that unlikely development would take many, many generations.  To &quot;extinguish&quot; us all in 50 years means killing the living.  The instrument of our execution is Daly's &quot;New energy field&quot;, which is fatal to those of us who lack, in Daly's strikingly Hitlerian turn of phrase, \\"purity and strength\\".  <br />Impure and weak people may find it interesting, then, that Daly really is interested in &quot;New energy fields&quot;.  In the November 2001 issue of _Philosophy Today_ she waxed enthusiastic about Rupert Sheldrake's morpho-genetic or morphic field.  Given _Quintessence-_'s fantasy of extinction by energy field, it's perhaps reassuring that Sheldrake's field has the scientific credibility of Reich's orgone accumulators (ie &quot;none&quot;).  But what can we make of a political work that celebrates the imagined extermination of all who are not pure and strong?  What do we make of its author?  Is Daly merely a joke, an embarrassment to her own cause and a gift to the right-wing media that drags out cases like Daly and Dworkin whenever they want to make feminism look ridiculous?  Or should she be held responsible when what she writes is hate literature as much as _The Turner Diaries_ and other neo-Nazi tracts?  Or do we make liberal excuses: &quot;this is a damaged person, who cannot be held morally accountable when she strikes out ineffectually at those around her&quot;?   <br />It's a serious question about responsibilities, and I don't know the answer.  On the whole, though I know Daly would dislike this option most, I favour the liberal option.  Daly causes more damage to her own causes than to anything else.  That was a pity when the implosion of Daly's own credibility took out a fair chunk of feminism's credibility with her, though the excesses of her most dogmatic followers were also to blame for that.  Daly is a key part of the reason why the most powerful political movement of the 1970s had become politically inert and ineffectual by the 1990s, as it still is, and that was a disservice to us all except for feminism's enemies.  But these days her advocacy damages only the fringe to which she is still attached.  <br />Still, Daly believes in naming her enemies, and perhaps it would show respect to name her philosophy too, though it's not necessary to in/vent a (child)ish jar-gone, a/kin to Daly's own, to find the name.  _Quntessence_'s lesbian separatist utopia, where superior people reproduce themselves by parthenogenesis without risking their moral or genetic purity by sexual contact with inferior beings, where there are no divergent ideas or dissent, where most of the inferior beings (men and women who like men) have been exterminated, except for a few tame specimens &quot;on other continents&quot;, is not a variant of feminism.  It's a variant of fascism.  We can laugh or apologise or condemn, but let's call it what it is. <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2001-12-21
US	50448822	R2J0MABMRUR5KI	0805067884	607359357	The Tristan Chord: Wagner and Philosophy	Books	5	122	133	N	N	Lucid, clear summary of Wagner's philosophical views	There aren't many composers whose philosophical views are of such crucial, and controversial, importance as Wagner's. But this is not because Wagner was an important philosopher. <br />As Magee shows, Wagner's thinking should not be too readily dismissed. Wagner was no philosophical dilletante. He was awesomely well-read in the philosophy, philology and linguistics of his day, in addition to his vast reading in literature ancient and &quot;modern&quot;, in history, myth, and the history of myth, and much more. And he was an intelligent and sometimes extraordinarily perceptive man, whose erudition was not just for showing off with but of vital importance to his thought and work. <br />However Wagner believed, wrongly, that his intuition was as sure a guide in the world of ideas as it was in music and drama. So his philosophical writings follow his intuitions, not his reasoning - indeed he seems to avoid reasoning, except in small bursts, out of principle. His writing is therefore irrational and self-contradictory, obscure in the worst German manner: neither original (except accidentally, where he achieves originality by misunderstanding a source, particularly Schopenhauer), nor lucid, nor &quot;true&quot;. &quot;True&quot;, that is, in the sense of being based on &quot;matters of fact or reason&quot;. <br />So his philosophy is not, despite what Wagner probably thought, of much importance in its own right. It is mainly important because it permeates and influences his major works, which are among the few most endlessly fascinating human creations of any kind. The increasingly Buddhist resignation, withdrawal from the world, of his later works are steeped in Schopenhauerian doctrine, just as the leftist radicalism of the earlier works are steeped in the work of the libertarian democratic-socialist Feuerbach. Magee's book is invaluable in tracing the effect of these and other philosophers on Wagner's work. _Tristan und Isolde_, for example, was indeed written in the white heat of a love affair, but that love was Wagner's love of Schopenhauer, not of Matthilde Wesendonck. <br />Wagner's philosophical ideas are important to his work in a way that seems true of no other composer. Mozart's use of Masonic symbols in _Zauberflöte_ and elsewhere (eg his &quot;three&quot; chords, three maidens, three boys, etc) has never seemed more than skindeep, almost flippant, references, while in Wagner the philosophical ideas cut deep both with the drama and the characters. Magee shows how the many complex layers and depths of works like the _Ring_, Tristan_, _Parsifal_, and even the earlier Romantic operas like _Lohengrin_ and _Tannhäuser_, can never be fully explored without an understanding of Wagner's key ideas: the futility and evil of power-seeking and conquest, the struggle of the artist to escape from, and yet redeem, the constricting culture in which they operate, the desirability of losing the world by annihilating one's one ego-consciousness, the value of the irrational and of dream, and much else. <br />There is another, hopefully temporary, reason why it is worth knowing what Wagner's philosophical ideas actually were. Recently there has been a small avalanche of books presenting Wagner as a proto-Nazi, even a serious influence on Hitler, and one who put proto-Nazi ideas into his dramas. Books by Rose, Weiner, Köhler, Zelinsky, Millington and others creak and twang with the sound of long bows stretched past the breaking point, as they try to fit Wagner's operas and his prose works into a Nazi frame. <br />And &quot;frame&quot; is the word. As Magee shows, Wagner was a radical democrat when young (democracy being a radical idea at that time, in Europe), who drifted as far right as supporting constitutional monarchy, particularly when constitutional monarchs were writing his cheques. And who, after his disillusionment with Bismarckian Germany, lost interest in politics altogether. There were slim pickings for the Nazis, except for theantisemitism that Wagner shared with Hitler's other favourites, particularly Bruckner, also Beethoven, Bach and Brahms and many others, whose antisemitism is as ignored as Wagner's is stressed. <br />Magee adds an appendix on Wagner's antisemitism, putting it back in context as a disgraceful form of bigotry, just like the ignorant bigotry of today's taxi-driver who sounds off about Vietnamese, or Afghan, or African immigrants. Wagner, like many a talk radio jock, populist politician and barroom loudmouth of our own day, called for Jews to lose their separate culture and identity and assimilate into German culture. This is contemptibly racist, but the diametric opposite of the Nazi program of racial segregation followed by genocide. I might add, as Magee does not, that Wagner was an ardent abolitionist, passionately opposing slavery in the US. On some racial issues Wagner was more progressive and less racist than many Europeans and Americans of his day. But we seldom hear about this from those who prefer a simple caricature to a complicated human being. <br />And of course the Nazis banned _Parsifal_ for its pacifist content, as well as banning complete cycles of the _Ring_, which charts Wotan's moral degradation and downfall in pointing out its message of the futility of power and conquest. Magee notes that Wagner performances actually became much less frequent under the Nazis than before the takeover. The soundtrack of the Third Reich was not Wagner, as today's filmmakers think; in reality the opera houses played Auber, Lortzing and Lehar (Hitler never attended a Wagner opera after 1942). When classical music was played at the rallies, it was Bruckner and Liszt as much as, or more than, Wagner, but mainly the music played was &quot;cholly Cherman&quot; brass band music. Magee makes these points clearly and elegantly. <br />My main criticism of the book is that Magee clearly loves Schopenhauer almost as much as does Wagner. As a result I think he grossly underestimates the influence of the left-wing Feuerbach not only on the early works but on the later works: even _Parsifal_ ends with a political revolution, the peaceful overthrow of a hereditary monarchy. And the _Ring_ ends with us, the vassals and working women, alive after the fire and flood, facing the future with all heroes and gods swept away. I believe there is at least as much Feuerbach and Schopenhauer in the mature operas, and Magee tends to skimp on the continued radicalism of Wagner's Feuerbachian leanings and borrowings.<br />But this is a minor criticism of a splendid book. It is an invaluable guide to Wagner's philosophy, as well as being a remarkably clear exposition of Schopenhauer's philosophy. Highly recommended. <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2001-11-25

Since atheists seem basically reasonable, mild-mannered citizens (even me!), this is a surprising and interesting claim.  But is Zacharias right about the Atheist Menace, or merely a bigot?<BR>  <BR>Reading _Shattered Visage_, it soon emerges that Zacharias' logic is nearly as confused as Madonna's hair.  Further, he is extraordinarily careless with facts and texts, and clearly has either not read, or failed to understand, many texts he cites.  <br />Examples?  First, a mild protest on Zacharias' misuse of Shelley's poem, _Ozymandias_, from which he takes his \\"shattered visage\\" title.  Ozymandias is an arrogant boaster, something Zacharias wants to make emblematic of atheism.  He should read more carefully.  Shelley's Ozymandias is the Pharoah Rameses II, no atheist but a religious figure, priest and god of his country's religion.  In Ozymandias' famous boast, \\"My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings!  Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\\" it's no accident that Shelley includes the words \\"King of Kings\\", with its echo of the Christian YHWH.  Shelley set his fable in far-off lands and places for ironical purposes and to avoid giving offence, but he was, among some other things, attacking the arrogance of the religious zealots who were Shelley's contemporaries, as Zacharias is ours.  <br />Zacharias uses Hawking's famous \\"know the mind of God\\" phrase to claim that current physics leads to religion.  Had he read more than _Brief History of Time_'s last line, Zacharias would have found a book that undermines theism with a non-theist account of the Big Bang.  Hawking, like Shelley, is an atheist, and was reducing the idea of god to metaphor.  Zacharias cites without reading.   <br />Zacharias' centrepiece, his use of Marx and Nietzsche, combines factual errors and illogic.  The illogic is in his assumption that atheism means more than absence ofbelief in any of humanity's thousands of gods.  Instead he thinks of atheism as a club whose members not only agree with each other about theism, but also on things having nothing to do with theism.<br />Thus he thinks that if Marx was an atheist, then other atheists must share Marx's other views.  In reality Marx's influential ideas, concerning politics and economics, are irrelevant to his atheism, as demonstrated by the many Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists etc who are or have been Marxists, and by the majority of atheists who are not Marxists.    <br />Nietzsche is more complex, and the focus of many of Zacharias' factual problems.  Though no Christian, Nietzsche was an irrationalist, despising atheism and drawn to non-Christian religions, if more for their style than for their \\"truth\\".  Nietzsche's religious views can't be summed up in one word as atheist: \\"pagan\\" might be closer.  \\"God is dead\\", for example, is not something an atheist could logically say.  Atheists don't believe there are gods who were once alive.  But Nietzsche is too complicated and too self-contradictory to be summed up in one word, or used in this simplistic way.  <br />So Zacharius merely looks odd, using Marx and especially Nietzsche as sticks with which to beat atheists.  It's a bit like attacking London by shelling Antarctica.  <br />Further, Nietzsche was anti-feminist, anti-democratic, pro-war and contemptuous of the political left.  (He may be closer to Zacharias than to this atheist.)  I dislike Nietzsche, except as writer, as deeply as Nietzsche despised compassion.  Therefore no partisanship but concern for truth makes me observe that Zacharias' claim that Nietzsche contributed materially to the rise of Nazism is absolute nonsense.  <br />Nor is Zacharias reliable on Hitler.  Hitler's public and private statements reveal a theist, not an atheist.  Further, Hitler's antisemitism, authoritarianism and belief in political violence are substantially derived from Karl Luegar's rightwing extremist Christian Socialist Party, as Hitler acknowledges in _Mein Kampf_.  This isn't the place to explore the Christian churches' ignoble (with exceptions) performance in Nazi Germany.  Nor should atheists return Zacharias' compliment by claiming that rightwing Christians are particularly prone to Nazism.  But we can observe that smearing atheists with a Nazi tag is dishonest and nasty.<br />Zacharias' key error is to connect theism and morality.  If the First Cause argument were correct rather than a self-contradiction, and one or more gods were necessary to account for the Big Bang, the sole logical consequence would be that physics has a supernatural element.  That wouldn't mean that the god or gods in question are those described in the Bhagavad Gita, Iliad, Bible, Koran, or whatever.  Nor would any moral consequences flow from the existence of one or more gods.  Unless you believe that extremely powerful beings must by definition be virtuous: that is, you secretly think that might is right.  <br />Nor have theist texts proved much of a guide to decent behaviour.  Most Christians would surely agree that many different moral systems derive from Bible readings, and some have been vicious: the slaughters of Albigensians, Arians and millions of other dissidents, the Crusades, the Inquisition (the model for the Gestapo and KGB), witch-burnings and so on.  Today we can see the wonderful things religion is achieving in the Mid-East, in India/Pakistan, Ireland, Serbia and now Afghanistan.  And the World Trade Centre fanatics murdered in the name of \\"God\\", not of (for example) Bertrand Russell. <br />In reality atheists are mostly virtuous people for the same reasons most religious believers are virtuous people.  We know we can only have safety, company and be liked by others if we behave with reasonable kindness and justice, and we aren't a danger to others.  We were brought up that way because cultures that don't bring up their children that way don't survive.  And we are gregarious primates with a nice side as well as some darker desires; mostly we don't _want_ to be too nasty to others.  <br />People who link morality to shonky arguments about supernatural beings aren't strengthening morality, but the opposite.   Zacharias wants to insult the morality of atheists, but instead insults the intelligence of his readers. <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2001-11-10

What's she?\\" from _Romeo and Juliet_, \\"I know a bank whereon the wild thyme grows\\" from _Midsummer Night's Dream_), bits of _The Rape of Lucrece_ and _Venus and Adonis_, every last one of the \\"Sonnetf to Sundrie Notef of Mufic_, and a few songs: \\"It was a lover and his lass,\\" and the like.  But anything that hinted at a darker worldview or Shakespeare's wider range was ruthlessly excluded.   <br />And suppose further that this anthology claimed that it represented Shakespeare's best work, showing his range and the things that make that writer great.  So that anyone who knew Shakespeare through that anthology would think that he was good for the odd flower poem and a bit of \\"Hey nonny nonny\\" but not much else besides.  <br />Isobel Quigly's _Shelley: A Selection_ is the Shelleyan equivalent of that Shakespeare anthology.  Thus, Shelley's epic philosophical drama _Prometheus Unbound_, both a meditation about the relationship between thought and language and a metaphor for political renewal based on moral growth (among other things), is represented by a couple of incidental lyrics; all complexity and depth are left on Quigly's cutting room floor.  _Julian and Maddalo_, with its urbanity, its bitter wit, crisp dialogue and vivid characterisation, is represented by one short purple passage (admittedly a splendid one) describing sunset over the Euganean hills.  <br />The satirical Shelley is not represented at all: the contemptuous handling of contemporary political figures in the energetically grotesque _Oedipus Tyrannus_ is missing in action, as is the more nuanced satire of _Peter Bell the Third_.  Oh, and the real Shelley may have been passionately engaged in the real world, protesting poverty, war and oppression in general and by specifics, in hard detail and in words of fire: but you won't find a hint of that in Quigly's selection.  Many of Shelley's finestpoems are simply omitted.  _The Mask of Anarchy_ , _Song to the Men of England_, _Similes for Two Political Characters_, _Feelings of a Republican on Hearing the Death of Napoleon_, for example, and much else besides: Quigly won't trouble you with a word of it.  <br />What she gives instead is every \\"pretty\\" poem Shelley ever wrote.  That includes great lyrics like the _Ode to the West Wind_ and _To a Skylark_ and others, but also all the poems Shelley dashed off as gifts to women friends, often for them to use as song lyrics, and often written to fit existing tunes.  These became enormously popular anthology pieces in the Victorian period, though Shelley himself showed little interest in them and never bothered to publish them.  <br />It's not that these are bad poems.  All are good of their kind, and many conceal a hard metaphysical kernel under a candied surface: _When the lamp is shattered_, and _Music when soft voices die_, for example.  Shelley was in a sense more of a metaphysical than a romantic poet, and in another sense more of a metaphysical poet than the metaphysicals themselves, since he was often concerned with genuine metaphysical questions in his poetry: thought and language, epistemology, and so on.   <br />But [...] Shelley is a minor and one-dimensional poet on the basis of this selection.  But it's the selection at fault, not the poet.    <br />Quigly also, irritatingly, strips poems of their contexts.  She gives _Alastor_ and (surprisingly in view of its Dantean difficulties) _Epipsychidion_ complete, but rips away the prefaces that Shelley used, in each case, as part of his framing and distancing effect: they are important to the way in which the poem is to be presented, and to be approached.  <br />She also follows the Victorians in getting various telling details wrong.  Thus _The Indian Girl's Serenade_ is printed as _The Indian Serenade_; the change allowed the Victorians to treat the poem as a personal lyric rather than a performance piece, and to marvel over Shelley's exquisite but rather weak sensibility: \\"O lift me from the grass!  I die, I faint, I fall!\\"  <br />The name change conceals the fact that this poem was written for soprano performance (to a tune from Mozart's _La Clemenza di Tito_).  Its charm is that it allows the performer opportunities to both use feminine wiles and at the same time mock them.  The \\"faint\\" at the end of the song is best performed, by the singer, with one eye open to judge the effect.  But Quigly knows nothing of this, referring to Shelley's \\"wholly personal love poems\\" in her wholly clueless introduction.  <br />Quigly's introduction clearly places her as a late surviving Victorian, who has read a little Leavis and Elliot but nothing of the critical work done on Shelley up to this anthology's first publication date, which is 1956.  Nothing has changed in this recent re-publication, despite the rich and fascinating work in Shelley criticism and Shelley studies in the years since Leavis.  But Quigly wouldn't be the person to guide you through that material anyway.  <br />I recommend the Norton Selection of Shelley's poetry and prose instead, with a much better and wider selection, and intelligent introduction and notes.  And it's quite reasonable to want the  romantic (in the Valentine's Day sense) Shelley, though that is only one side of a multi-faceted poet of astounding technical skill, sophistication and range: but for that side of Shelley I'd recommend Richard Hughes' _Shelley on Love_.  Either selection is far better than this vapid and misleading collection of prettiana.  <br />Cheers!<br />Laon<BR>PS Also avoid Penguin's Poet to Poet series' Shelley entry.  20th century poetaster Kathryn Raine's Shelley selection is if anything slighter than Quigly's.	2001-10-17
US	50448822	R2TENVKR2Y11F7	0943742129	137422237	The Banquet	Books	5	11	13	N	N	The five stars are for Shelley	This book contains three things.  Shelley's translation of Plato's dialogue _The Banquet_ (or _Symposium_), the first and still the greatest English version; Shelley's courageously anti-homophobic essay _A Discourse on the Manners of the Ancient Athenians Relative to the Subject of Love_; and an introduction by editor John Lauritsen. The five stars are for Shelley. <br />The _Symposium_ presents a group of Athenian aristocrats who share privilege, contempt for democracy and the leisure needed for philosophy. After one banquet, the slaves gone, they compete to make the best speech in praise of love. The most memorable speeches are by Aristophanes, Socrates and Alcibiades. <br />Aristophanes creates a comic myth in which men and women were once joined, sharing a body and a soul (and, each androgynous creature having four legs and four arms, getting about by tumbling). The gods became jealous of these creatures' happiness and split them up, creating the two sexes we know today. But men and women stayed together, each with the partner with whom they had shared a soul. So Zeus scattered them, forcing the male and female soulmates apart. And still men and women search amongst each other, looking for that one perfect soulmate. <br />Socrates' speech concerns love between men and boys, arguing that in their highest forms these loves have no sexual element.  Alcibiades arrives late and drunk, and refuses to speak in praise of anything but Socrates himself. The party then breaks up. <br />The _Symposium_ is Plato's most theatrical dialogue, with vivid characterisation, deft comic touches and soaring poetic language. Shelley was also fascinated by Alcibiades' anecdote about Socrates standing lost in thought, oblivious to sun, cold, thirst or pain, motionless for three days. Shelley's translation is literally accurate (despite some minor errors) but also accurate in the higher sense of being a brilliantly poetic rendering of a brilliantly poetic work. Shelley called Plato's original &quot;radiant&quot;, lamenting that his own words were a &quot;gray veil&quot; over the brightness of the original. But his modesty was unwarranted: his is one of the great English prose translations: fresh, clear and indeed radiant.<br />Shelley's _Ancient Athenians_ essay is just as remarkable. It attempts to explain how [some] ancient Athenians could have thought love between men, including sexual love, was &quot;higher&quot; than heterosexual love. In doing so he presented a pioneering case against homophobia. The courage of Shelley's stance in his 1818 essay, as in so many things, is simply astonishing. <br />Shelley's argument was that homosexuality flourished in <BR>ancient Athens, and was considered nobler than heterosexual relations,  because of the suppression of women. Athenian society didn't educate girls or women, and excluded them from the city's intellectual, artistic and political life. Therefore, Shelley argued, it was harder for male-female relationships to be equal partnerships, or to include the life of the mind, or indeed much beyond the housekeeping mundane or the purely sexual. Though he argued against condemning homosexuality he was also, as a proto-feminist, arguing that the social conditions that (he thought) foster homosexuality are unjust and undesirable. <br />Lauritsen's introduction misreads both texts in claiming them as gay classics. Plato's text has Socrates promote intergenerational same-sex relationships, though ideally without sexual practice or the body. Alcibiades' speech is homoerotic in its praise of Socrates, but crucial to that praise is that Socrates is celibate, even when tempted by the beautiful Alcibiades himself. Later, Plato will withdraw this limited tolerance, banning homosexuals from his &quot;ideal&quot; republic. As Karl Popper observed, Plato was a sign on the road that led to Fascism, Nazism, Communism. The _Symposium_ is a treasure of world literature, but too problematic a text simply to be celebrated as a gay classic. <br />Shelley's essay is also classic but not &quot;gay&quot;. (Setting aside the fact that &quot;gay&quot; places someone within a culture that didn't exist in Shelley's lifetime.) Shelley argued that homosexual relationships can be loving and noble, and should not be condemned unless there is brutality or other things that would be equally undesirable in a heterosexual relationship. But he argues as a sympathetic outsider (with bisexual male friends), who also wrote essays defending the political rights of Ireland, deists and Catholics, without being Irish, or a deist or Catholic. <br />Lauritsen arguments for claiming Shelley as &quot;gay&quot; are astonishingly shonky. One, amazingly, is that Shelley was good-looking. But ... what about good-looking heterosexuals? Or Shelley's facial boils? More Lauritsen &quot;evidence&quot; is that Shelley stood naked when Trelawney first met him. But in public school culture then as now it was &quot;manly&quot;; not to fuss about being naked in front of other men; also, Shelley had been bathing, and he'd expected to pass women on the beach but didn't know Trelawney was there. Lauritsen mentions missing diary pages to suggest a cover-up. But he should know that the diary in question is Claire Claremont's and surrounding evidence indicates that the missing pages concern a pregnancy, an entirely heterosexual scandal. And Lauritsen says, meaningfully, that Shelley kissed friends at school, but should surely know that in that less emotionally constrained age men kissed to indicate friendship, not trouser turbulence. And so on. <br />Instead, Shelley was something more radical. Fascinated by androgyny, he asserted the right to enact masculinity as it suited him; ridin', shootin' and boatin' with Byron and Trelawney, and gentle and &quot;womanly&quot; with women and some male friends. Shelley unhitched the link, as Lauritsen does not, between gender performance and sexual orientation, in that sense being an ancestorof more fluid current thinking on sexuality. The idea that a man who is prepared to drop the male &quot;armour&quot; is necessarily homosexual is a 19th century conservative idea: it's ironic that some gay activists later took it up. <br />But despite reservations on Lauritsen's claims, he deserves our thanks for making Shelley's two magnificent tests available again. Shelley might be bemused to find himself claimed as gay, but he'd be pleased to find his works still enlisted in the struggle against bigotry and in the cause of love. <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2001-09-17
US	50448822	R3S1K0SU7Q2IJX	0801861195	894286536	The Complete Poetry of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Vol. 1	Books	5	20	20	N	N	At last! Shelley plain after 200 (or so) years!	The state of Shelley publishing has been one of the literary scandals of the last 200-odd years. <br />Mary Shelley, Shelley's widow and first editor, did her work under threat. Shelley's father Sir Timothy Shelley wanted his son's memory forgotten. Since Sir Timothy was paying a &quot;pension&quot; of 150 pounds a year to his son's widow and child, he was able to blackmail Mary Shelley out of writing a biography or issuing a complete works, by threatening to cut off her income. The readiness to starve his own grandson to strike at his dead son is villainy of the sort you'd expect to find in a Victorian novel, not in life. But there it was; the poet's father was a Bad Man, and no doubt part of the model for the occasional Bad Fathers (the Cenci, Jupiter etc) in Shelley's work. <br />So Mary Shelley's work, while Sir Timothy was still alive, publishing the most important poems with notes that collectively add up to a kind of biography, was an act of loyalty to her husband, and not without courage. <br />Her successors deserve less praise. Though occasionally ingenious in correcting details of text and recovering poems from notebook fragments, they betrayed Shelley. Some poems they deliberately omitted for their radicalism: the 1820 ballad, &quot;Young Parson Williams&quot;, was one example. Other poems they left in a bowlerised state, in particular _Laon and Cythna_, published with its religious, sexual and political radicalism blunted as _The Revolt of Islam_. Still other poems were distorted, by carelessness (eg the missing stanza of _On the Head of the Medusa_, the missing lines in _Mont Blanc_) or by sentimentality. <br />A glaring example of sentimental distortion is the breaking off of the _Triumph of Life_ fragment at the line: &quot; 'Then what is life,' I cried.&quot; Shelley's draft continues for four lines, showing that the dark vision of the procession of life, that has dominated the poem till this point, is to &quot;roll&quot; on and out of the poem. Onesection of the poem had ended and another was about to start. The whole poem, if it had been finished, probably involved a movement from despair into light in the manner of _Prometheus Unbound_. But the absence of those lines led many commentators to believe that the poem was intended to be only a statement of despair. (Rather as if we had Act I of _Prometheus Unbound_ but not the later sections of that poem.) <br />Also, Shelley wrote &quot;I said&quot;, not &quot;I cried&quot;. The Victorian editors substituted &quot;cried&quot; because &quot;crying&quot; gives us a properly &quot;romantic&quot; Shelley, less like the real, controlled artist. And &quot;cried&quot; furnished a spurious rhyme with &quot;wayside&quot; and &quot;abide&quot; in the lines above - though at the same time distorting Shelley's terza rima. <br />And stopping the poem at that dramatic point gave us another Victorian myth: the young poet, defeated by the Great Question and failing to find an answer in verse, plunges beneath the waves in search of final truth. A romantic suicide instead of a pointless accidental drowning (or quite possibly murder by an Italian fishing smack, intending piracy). Without digressing into the many reasons why the suicide story is nonsense, it can be observed in this context that distortion of Shelley's poetry inevitably leads to distortions of biography as well as of interpretation. <br />And there things have stood, for over 100 years. Oxford University Press could reasonably have claimed to be the guardian of Shelley's poetry, and they have failed their trust shamefully. Oxford began publishing a genuinely complete poetical works in the 1970s, edited by Neville Rogers. This project mysteriously stopped after just two of the projected four volumes. However none of Rogers' work on Shelley's poems up to 1817 has been incorporated into any of the one-volume Shelley editions, including Oxford's. Instead the unsatisfactory Victorian text, with all its distortions, bowdlerisations, suppressions, omissions and shoddinesses has been allowed to stand.<br />The first volume of this four-volume project gives us every reason to hope we will finally - after nearly 200 years - be able to read Shelley's poems without distortion, censorship or omission. This volume contains what would generally be considered to be Shelley's juvenilia: for example the intriguing mini-epic _The Wandering Jew_ in which Ahasuerus appears not as a monster but as a sympathetic character for one of the first times in European literature. <br />And we get the political passion and the outrageous parodies of the _Posthumous Fragments of Margaret Nicholson_. To get an idea of the sheer outrageousness of the _Posthumous Fragments_, imagine a contemporary poet publishing scurrilous satires and angry political poems as if they were written by John Hinckley (the guy who tried to assassinate Reagan), and smuggled out of his cell. Then imagine that one of the poems included an exchange between Che Guevera and Pattie Hearst, in which they sing, in short panting lines, of oral sex. That gets you some idea of the naughtiness, in 1810 terms, of the _Epithalamium for Francis Revaillac and Charlotte Corday_. <br />And Fraistat's notes on the poems, biographical and interpetative, are first-rate. There are places he can be argued with (for example the events - background to two verse letters that may be the worst poems of Shelley's life - concerning a possible affair between Shelley's mother and Fergus Graham, where I think Shelley had inside information and his interpretation can be taken seriously) but he never strays from evidence and his interpretations of events and of poems are always reasonable and insightful. <br />The next volume will bring us Shelley's first great poem, _Queen Mab_, also _Alastor_, the shorter poems_Mont Blanc_, and the _Hymn to Intellectual Beauty_, and perhaps the restored epic _Laon and Cythna_. This is a great project, and my only criticism is thatit at least 100 years overdue. My absolute highest recommendation to Shelley readers. Note to Fraistat et al: More volumes please! <br />Cheers! <br />Laon (no relation)	2001-08-28
US	50448822	RYU384RFI77D9	0674445783	76019242	In Harm’s Way: The Pornography Civil Rights Hearings	Books	1	47	70	N	N	Dworkin/MacKinnon: Meese/Dobson: the domestic violence nexus	This book is a product of the Meese Commission established by President Reagan to repudiate the findings of the Nixon-appointed Commission investigating pornography which, after wide consultation, found no evidence that exposure to pornography leads to criminal conduct.  The Meese Commission avoided coming to this &quot;wrong&quot; conclusion by not calling for or consulting studies (in the peer-reviewed academic sense) and instead relying on anecdotal claims largely supplied by MacKinnon and Dworkin.  <br />This book is a product of that commission in two senses.  First, is through the Meese Commission that Dworkin and MacKinnon rose to fame as the feminists acceptable to the religious right (though as their agenda became clearer they became decreasingly acceptable to other feminists).  Second, this book is a replica of the kind of evidence given to the Meese Commission, except that Edwin Meese himself has had to be removed from the picture.  That slight revision is necessary because Dworkin/MacKinnon ally Meese resigned as Attorney-General on 16 May 1988, embroiled in a sea of scandals (Iran/Contra, the Inslaw affair, etc), that made him perhaps less credible as an authority on morality.  Thus the same case had to be presented again, in a Meese-less setting.  <br />The evidence and arguments are the same in the ironically named _Civil Rights Hearings_ as for Meese, and suffer the same faults.  The real agenda is both women's amply documented objection to heterosexuality itself (Dworkin once wrote that heterosexual contact might be acceptable _so long as the man's penis is not erect_, which is of course a gracious concession.) However as anti-heterosexuality is one form of bigotry that will NOT play well with the religious right, it was necessary to hide this agenda behind other issues.  <br />Exploitation of workers in the porn industry is one such issue.  But anyone who has worked in industries where unskilled woman predominate, for example factories and fruit-picking, and who has read and heard about pay and conditions in the porn industry, knows that porn is a less exploitative employer than most.  It's no surprise that so many women, and men, choose to work in it.  Despite Dworkin/MacKinnon's best rhetoric, porn doesn't seem even in the top 1,000,000, as bad employers go.  So if Dworkin/MacKinnon were motivated by concern for exploited women workers, logically they'd be working with women meat workers, night-time office and factory cleaners, etc: dangerous jobs that pay peanuts.  But if they did believe that porn actors are unusually exploited, and that mistaken perception were really the basis of their concern, then logically they would be supporting the union-like organisations run by and for porn workers, that (like increasing numbers of porn companies) are mainly run by women.  But actually they show no sisterhood for women in porn: the &quot;right-wing women&quot;, the sexual traitors that MacKinnon/Dworkin would like to force out of work and into other jobs, more unpleasant and less well-paid, are clearly held in hatred and contempt by both writers.  <br />(Any record in any medium involving children or non-consenting adults is a different kind of case.  In those cases the photograph or film is the record of a crime against the child or other person.  The footage can and should be used to find and prosecute those responsible, along with those in the distribution and consumption chain who help the perpetrators profit from their crime.  But to pretend, as McKinnon/Dworkin do in trying to score a point, that a torture movie shot in Chechnya, or footage of a child being abused, is morally the same as fantasy footage involving willing and quite well paid actors, is an obscene trivialisation of real human suffering.  MacKinnon/Dworkin's rhetorical methods do sometimes lead them unto evil.)  <br />Another issue, and a valid one, is misogynist sub-texts in porn.  But if misogyny were truly their concern and not dislike ofsexual content, then MacKinnon/Dworkin would be more concerned by far more misogynist genres: crime thriller, horror, teen gross-out comedy, and, of course, the media products of their own allies on the religious right.  And they would be supporting women who produce pro-women porn.  But instead their choice of target is consistent with people who dislike sex, not misogyny.<br />But there is another sub-text left over from the Meese Commission that launched this book.  One of the commissioners was Dr James Dobon, author of _Dare to Discipline_, a manual advocating that parents have the \\"courage\\" to hit their children, not only with hands but with sticks, strips of leather and other instruments.  Dobson even gives suggestions on how to hit babies still in diapers.  It's not relevant to debate Dobson here, only to note that few feminists would support an advocate of domestic violence, which includes violence against children.  Many feminists believe that men who hit children are much more likely to hit women as well, and in any case some babies are girls!  But in _In Harm's Way_, as elsewhere, MacKinnon/Dworkin not only fail to attack this colleague of theirs; instead they do their best to bolster his, and his Commission's, credibility.  <br />A feminism that refuses to distinguish between torture and fantasy, and that thinks a photograph or film showing a penis and a vagina in close proximity is so evil that it justifies cuddling up to advocates of domestic violence, is feminism that has gone on a strange, mad, journey and turned into something else.  The utopia that MacKinnon/Dworkin argue for resembles no place on earth so much as Afghanistan under the Taliban, where all erotic images of women, among much else, have been ruthlessly suppressed.  Oh yes: and corporal punishment within families has state and religious encouragement.  But the women trapped in that ghastly place show no signs of feeling, as MacKinnon/Dworkin might say, \\"empowered\\".  This is a mad and hypocritical, anti-feminist, book.  <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2001-08-19

His initial series of comedies (_Lucky Jim_ and its successors in broadly similar mode) had begun bringing in diminishing returns, at least in terms of critical attention and sales.  And later, in the 1980s, Amis found a different kind of form with _The Old Devils_ and his last books.<br />But at more or less the mid-point in his career Amis experimented with a series of genre novels.  Of this series _The Alteration_ was science fiction (an alternate-worlds story in which the Reformation never happened), _The Riverside Murders_ is more or less in the English murder mystery tradition (that is, there is more interest in the puzzle than in the US crime novel, but at its best the English whodunnit is also more likely to give us human characters rather than groteques).  _The Green Man_ is the last and most successful of the series, and is in the horror genre.<br />As a horror story &quot;The Green Man&quot; offers only mild chills, but its other rewards are substantial.  It's a portrait of Maurice Allingham, drinker, womaniser and host of The Green Man, an English hotel with a fine table, excellent wine list, and a couple of picturesque ghosts, though with no recent sightings.<br />Maurice is both cynical and observant, yet he misses much of what is important of what goes on around him.  The things he misses include sinister stirrings around him that indicate that the supernatural elements around him have not been so much extinct as dormant, and are now reawakening.  More importantly he fails to observe almost everything of importance about those who are closest to him, his long(ish) suffering wife, his lonely, resentful teenage daughter, and his son, who has already moved on from him.<br />Though we are invited to see through Allingham's eyes, we are also given a portrait of Allingham, a man who has gone a long way on charm but is finding that trait not enough, any more, to stave off the consequences of various kinds of misbehaviour.  With women he finds that they are still prepared to bed him, but they no longer seem to like him much.  With his drinking he finds he can still lie to his doctor, but he cannot deny - at least to himself - the danger signs: shakes, mild strokes,  visual and auditory hallucinations.  And his teenage daughter still resents his absense from her life; but she is coming close to not minding any more.<br />Some critics have missed the strength and trenchancy of Amis' critique of his male narrators.  Amis is often accused of misogyny for portrayals such as the women in &quot;The Green Man&quot;, when in fact it is principally the narrator who Amis is mocking, not the women the narrator comments on.<br />This is the book that contains the famous &quot;threesome&quot; scene, in which the two women participants soon lose interest in the male narrator who believes he set up the scene.  Maurice tries and fails to attract at least some attention, find a spare limb to involve himself with, and eventually gives up and gets dressed.  The scene has been misread from time to time; it is probably not intended as a portrait of what Amis thinks must inevitably happen in a threesome, but rather a comic come-uppance for a character whose extreme selfishness, sexual and otherwise, is well delineated.<br />Both women then leave Maurice for good, showing in doing so considerably more strength or moral dignity than Maurice has yet managed.  (There is a redemption, of sorts, towards the end of the book, when his attention is finally focussed, almst too late, on his daughter.)  But Amis is, in most of his career (_Jake's Thing_ and _Stanley and the Women_ being exceptions) a more painful critic of male behaviour than of female.<br />Amis' use of the darker English folklore - the &quot;Green Man&quot; and &quot;Thomas Underhill&quot; myths - are also interestingly sinister.  And the portrayal of &quot;God&quot; as a slightly camp, terribly urbane young man is onethat has been hugely influential - in an unacknowledged way - in popular culture since &quot;The Green Man&quot; appeared.<br />By the way I think it clear that the supernatural events are &quot;real&quot;.  Maurice is not given his shakes and hallucinations to indicate that he is an unreliable observer in the manner of Henry James' governess in &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;.  The contrast is pointed, in fact, with an entertaining parody of James' prose style in the book.  It is clear that Maurice does not &quot;see things&quot; in that sense or to quite that extent (in fact his trouble is that he does _not_ see things).  Rather, Maurice's shakes, voices and palpitations mean that he will not be believed by his family, and he is forced to deal with things on his own.<br />This is a very fine comic novel, with mild horror and (as often with Amis) a little more depth than it pretends to.<br />Cheers!<br />Laonyoung man is one that has been hugely influential - in an unacknowledged way - in popular culture since &quot;The Green Man&quot; appeared.  <br />By the way I think it clear that the supernatural events are &quot;real&quot;.

US	50448822	R5BJ43L0FXBZZ	0679601112	482154482	The Complete Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley (Modern Library)	Books	1	111	122	N	N	Buyer beware!	This disgraceful edition calls itself the &quot;Complete Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley&quot;.  It is nothing of the kind.<br />Much of Shelley's work was suppressed by 19th century editors, poems such as &quot;A Ballad&quot; for example.  The poem, beginning &quot;Young Parson Richards stood at his gate&quot;, was one of the poems Shelley intended for his projected &quot;Popular Songs&quot; volume, political poems in simple language to be sold amongst workers and their families in England.  &quot;A ballad&quot; concerns religious hypocrisy, prostitution and starvation.<br />Standard editions of Shelley still suppress this poem, 218 years after it was written.<br />Shelley's first editor, Mary Shelley had no choice about censoring Shelley's more radical poems: she was dependent on Shelley's father Sir Timothy Shelley, for 150 pounds a year that was the different between survival and starvation for herself and her son.  And Sir Timothy wanted his dead son, that shameful atheist, democrat and philanthropist, forgotten.  Mary Shelley was under financial threat if she preserved her late husband's memory, and in that context her work as editor was brave and loyal.<br />Let's not forget that people went to jail, during the early and mid-19th century, for publishing Shelley's works: Chartist and other working class and radical publishers.<br />But by the cusp of the 20th century, Shelley's Victorian editors had no such excuses: and they were neither brave nor loyal.  They _could_ have produced a genuinely complete works, but they chose not to.  They wanted to give the world a harmless Shelley, a &quot;beautiful and ineffectual angel&quot;, as Matthew Arnold called him, and they were prepared to suppress and distort Shelley's works to help preserve that image.<br />But  - amazingly - here we are in the 21st century, and this edition appears.  And not only does it perpetuate the various omissions of Shelley's 19th century editors/suppressors (why is _Laon and Cythna_ still appearing in its bowdlerised form as _The Revolt of Islam_?), but THIS EDITION ACTUALLY DELETES CONTROVERSIAL SHELLEY MATERIAL THAT EVEN THE VICTORIANS HAD THE COURAGE TO PRINT.<br />So if you buy this edition, you'll find many Shelley poems missing, as you will if you buy the Oxford edition of Shelley's Poetical Works.  But in this edition you will also find that the notes to _Queen Mab_ have disappeared.  Why?  The notes to _Queen Mab_ are as integral a part of the poem as Elliot's  Notes to _The Wasteland_.  The reason is not space, or that the notes are prose.  If prose was the problem, why not remove the long prefaces to several of the longer works, or the notes to _Hellas_, or Mrs Shelley's notes?<br />The reason, clearly, is that Shelley's opinions, as expressed in the notes ot _Queen Mab_ are still controversial.  The atheism and the defence of religious freedom including freedom from religion, his hatred of his government's military adventures, his views on marriage, on prostitution, his proto-socialism, are still capable of offending the sort of committee that gets books pulled from libraries, especially school libraries.<br />And sadly, it seems that there are still publishers who believe that people should be protected from the knowledge that Shelley was a radical, a controversialist on the side of the weak, the poor and powerless, an activist some of whose messages would see him in trouble, still, with those in power today.<br />Not everyone who buys Shelley _wants_ Shelley the controversialist, of course.  He is perhaps the supreme English lyric poet, a poet of nature and of light, idealism and love.  But even if you don't particularly want to read the notes to _Queen Mab_, and the other material missing from this volume, you may feel that censorship of a major English poet, whose work and thought should be part of all of our heritage, should not be rewarded or encouraged.

It's a pity Marc Hauser makes no attempt, Edgar-Rice-Burroughs-style, to transliterate that last cry: I'd like to know the vervet word for &quot;human&quot;.  <br />But though Hauser acknowledges the many species that exchange sounds that are very close to being &quot;words&quot;, he argues convincingly that they do not have language.  That's disappointing, of course, for those of us with that Dr Doolittle urge for closer communication with animals, but clearly how things are.        And despite the subtitle &quot;What animals really hink&quot; Hauser concludes that we are too different ever to truly know that: not only will we never settle down with a lion or dog and exchange views about politics and sex and art; but much of their behaviour will remain enigmatic to us.  We simply can't imagine or empathise our way into knowing what they are thinking.  Many people, anthropomorphising wildly, like to imagine that they can.  But there are always alternative explanations for animal behaviour, and no way of checking which is the correct one.    Nor do animals have a &quot;moral sense&quot;, as is argued in the final section of the book.  Though animals do cooperate, and will sacrifice themselves or their interests for the benefit of others.  On that question I'm not so sure that the animal form of &quot;ethics&quot; is really qualitively different from the human, despite the cultural ideas we heap up around concepts of &quot;morality&quot;.  But that's an argument about human thought, and therefore outside the scope of the book.  <br />In some ways the earliest parts of the book are the most interest.  Animals don't have language, but they do have tools for understanding the world: dividing reality into classes of objects, engaging in rudimentary mathematics, and creating mental maps of the physical world.  <br />This section ofthe book could be usefully read by anyone still believing, along with the previous generation of French philosophers, that a chair, for example, is a linguistic construct rather than an object of a certain kind.  Animals deal with reality in ways that strongly suggest that their perception of the world, and their organisation of the world into different classes of things, by edibility, animate or inert, sharp or soft, green or blue, and so on, is at the fundamental building-block level similar to ours.  Clearly there is a world without language, let alone text. <br />The book doesn't show us, as its sub-title claims, &quot;What animals really think&quot;, but it does contain a great deal of fascinating information on how animals organise their information about the world, the kind of guesses they make about the behaviour of others, the cries and signals that became the building-blocks of our languages, and much else besides.  And it's not the most misleading title in this genre: consider the &quot;Penguin English Dictionary&quot;.  A splendid resource, certainly, but penguins don't seem to respond to any of it ...  Anyway, you can't use Hauser's book to &quot;talk to the animals either&quot;, but at least you wll know more about why you can't.  Recommended.  <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2001-08-08
US	50448822	R3E7PPTFCOURYJ	0312252137	165562895	Savage: The Life and Times of Jemmy Button	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Savages all round, but sympathetically treated	The title, &quot;Savage&quot;, is of course ironical.  Captain Fitzroy thought, when he captured three Tierra Fuegian men and a young girl in 1830, that his &quot;specimens&quot; were the savages, even as he sailed them away from their homes and their grieving families.  <br />So _Fitzroy_ is the savage, of course?  Certainly, but Hazlewood's irony, and his capacity for imaginative compassion, is deeper than that.  <br />Fitzroy thought he was doing good.  Mutual incomprehension between the Tierra del Fuegians and passing European and American ships had led to murder: and people with muskets and ship's cannon are more efficient at murder than people with spears.  If some Tierra del Fuegians could be taught English and gain an understanding of European culture and manners, there might be fewer violent encounters.  And if his captives could be taught to build and cultivate crops, then they could be returned to their homes, equipped with seeds, food animals and tools, and perhaps teach their kinspeople a more comfortable and secure way of living.  <br />Hazlewood tells the story of how this benevolent (by the standards of its time) project goes horribly wrong.  The remarkable figure of Jemmy Button, the resourceful young man captured by Fitzroy (later returned to his home by Fitzroy, as promised), and how he fared in English culture and his own, is a central thread in that story.  However this is history and not biography; the canvas is wider than one man.  <br />Tragedy comes with the arrival of the Patagonian Missionary Society in the Land of Fire.  Like Fitzroy they believed they came with good intentions; unlike Fitzroy they offered little of value, took much, and mostly broke their promises.  They sought the help of Jemmy Button, who was back living with his people, but with a half-remembered stock of English.  Button offered that help, and he and his family, and other Tierra del Fuegians were in return kept as virtual slaves in the Society's encampment.  Hazlewood shows how tensions rose until the missionaries were massacred, probably by a party led by Jemmy Button.  <br />Interestingly, despite what we think of as the racist arrogance of the Victorians, the authorities in nearby Port Stanley and in London understood the events in terms that we might consider &quot;modern&quot;: they saw the massacre as the result of the missionary society's cruelty, bigotry and duplicity, which had placed intolerable pressure on the Tierra del Fuegians.  Claims that the slain missionaries had been &quot;martyrs&quot; were quietly (and justly) derided, and no attempt was made to avenge their deaths.  <br />The title &quot;Savage&quot;, I think, refers neither to the Tiera del Fuegians nor by heavy-handed irony to the Victorians.  Though the Patagonian Missionary Society does emerge as something of a villain, their villainy was too drab to be &quot;savage&quot;.  The title refers not to people but to the events that led to the destruction of the first and second missions to Tierra del Fuego.  <br />The wholesale slaughter of Jemmy Button's people by European settlers a generation or two later is dealt with briefly at the end of the book; that was unquestionably the act of savages, but beyond the focus of this book.  <br />This is a great book.  Far from depressing despite the subject matter, it is instead encouraging about the possibility of communication and imaginative sympathy between people whose cultures, histories, technologies and languages have virtually nothing in common, so long as neither side is blinded by racist or religious arrogance.  <br />We are in some ways as far from the Victorians as we are from the Tierra del Fuegians.  It may be easier for us to imaginatively identify with Tierra del Fuegian ideas on (for example) family, sex, politics, clothing, and perhaps religion, than with the Victorians.  The Victorians, particularly Hazlewood's missionaries, accepted a vast and rigid structure of ideas, almost none of which we now accept; Tierra del Fuegian attitudes are in some ways easier for a post-post-modernist to accept.  (This is not to pretend that the Tierra del Fuegians were new age philosophers, let alone Noble Savages.)<br />So the book is an exercise in empathy for both the Victorian and Tierra del Fuegian protagonists, and reveals the humanity of both.  An example is Jemmy Button's bashfulness in the presence of an Englishwoman, when a British ship arrives at his Tierra del Fuegian home twenty years after Button's return.  That his discomfort turns out to be because he has married, and that Button is inclined to conceal his married status while talking with a lady (&quot;English ladies very good,&quot; he had commented), is cheering enough, and so too is the comprehension of the British sailors when Button's wife arrives by canoe, to find out what is going on.  Button's embarrassment, and the hearty congratulations of the sailors when they recognise the cause of his embarrassment, is in its own way an inspiring moment, and well captured by Hazlewood.  These are not saints on either side of this cultural divide, but they are human.  And they enjoy their mutual recognition without imagining, as a post-structuralist might, that they are unable to communicate because they are irredeemiably &quot;other&quot;.  <br />While it both inspires and also makes angry, &quot;Savage&quot; is also a hugely entertaining book.  Hazlewood offers many revealing glimpses into peoples, white and brown, whose ways of life have long since vanished.  For example this, from a 17th century sea-captain's letter to his son: <br />&quot;A merchant of Loundon wrote to a factor of his beyoand sea,  desired him by the next shipp to send him 2 or 3 Apes; he forgot the r, so it was 203 Apes.  His factor has sent him four score, and says he shall have the rest by the next shipp ... if yorself or frendes will buy any Apes to breede on, you could never have such a chance as now.&quot;  <br />Even then, a simple typo could have embarrassing results... <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2001-07-22

That's good; I've read enough condescension about ELP from rock writers, who aren't always the bravest of people when it comes to expressing an unfashionable opinion.  So it's good have a book focussing on the music, and recognising that at this band's best they were extraordinary.  <br />And I can recommend it to fans, for the usual things books of this kind are good at: stories behind the pieces, such as the power struggle over producing &quot;Tarkus&quot;.  And it solves some long-term puzzles - eg who was the &quot;Frazer&quot; who co-wrote songs with Lake on the first two albums?  It turns out he was one of their roadies, not some mysterious Pete Sinfield character...  <br />Its weakness is not wanting to talk about the downside: Lake's vocal problems, the reasons behind the atrocity that was &quot;Love Beach&quot;, and other such things.  There a little more probing, and a preparedness to write unpalatable truths would have made a useful book better.  <br />That said, this is a useful, honest and admirable book.  I read it more or less at a gulp: after all, I've been waiting for it for about 25 years...  If you're ELP fan enough to have looked up this book at all, then I'd recommend that you get it.  <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2001-07-22

Nor did I like the members of Led Zeppelin, with the possible exception of John Paul Jones, for having the sense to stay clear of the rest of the band between gigs.  <br />But this is an interesting book about what stardom can do to people.  I'm not expressing any sympathy, here; the Roger Waters/Billy Corgan school of &quot;life's awful for rich and famous rock stars&quot; whining is beneath contempt, basically.  If they have a problem with being rich and famous, they can cure beng rich with a five-minute phone call to any charity, while fame takes, oh, six months to cure.  By &quot;what stardom can do to people&quot; I am talking about turning people who are initially no worse than most of us into brutalised, narcissistic morons, too drugged and too stupid to know how ugly they are becoming.   <br />Cole's book is from the inside of that culture in every sense; he actually expects us to laugh along with the band and their hangers-on, when &quot;losers&quot; get beaten up, when people who aren't rich have their property smashed and Bonzo laughs at the promise to pay for the damage, making it clear that the payment won't happen.  <br />The treatment of young women is one of the least of the band's appallingnesses; mostly groupies got more or less the experience they came for, and where there is informed consent there is no abuse.  This goes even for Page's interest in underage girls and whips, usually the focus of most moral condemnation of this band; but Page emerges as a relatively gentle soul, and at least one of the girls as a rather stronger personality than him.  <br />On the other hand, Cole expects us to share his amusement about kidnapping a group of underage girls and flying them interstate without their consent, or their parents' knowledge or consent, leaving them to find their own ways home.  The point was to have a joke on Plant.  Cole warned the girls notto talk to Plant, and then watched Plant fail to seduce the terrified girls, and wonder what had happened to his charms.  (Plant didn't wonder long; in no time he'd concluded they were all lesbians.)  What a laugh, Cole expects us to think: but this is creepy, skin-crawling stuff.  <br />But it's still a compelling book.  The waste of Led Zeppelin's astonishing talent was a tragedy.  Sure, the talent that produced the first five albums, bits of _Physical Graffiti_ and most of _In Through the Out Door_ was not entirely wasted; that's a respectable body of work that is still exciting to hear 30-odd years later.  But the potential that was thrown away in smack, booze and ego-driven excess is far greater than the achievements.  Anyone who was wondering how come _Presence_ and much of _Physical Graffiti_ is so uninspired, and how come such a bountiful well ran dry so fast, need only read this book.  <br />It is, of course, abysmally badly written, but that's part of its authenticity, if you like.  <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2001-05-30

Though he dutifully concedes Kubrick's genius Raphael patronises Kubrick throughout. It's surprising Raphael didn't work in a scene, somewhere, in which Stanley used the wrong fork at dinner, or ordered the wrong wine. But the effect is not ironic comedy in which we laugh at poor Kubrick, as Raphael possibly hoped, but that more basic form of comedy in which a pompous and malicious man takes a pratfall: the prat in this case being Raphael. <br />I haven't read much Raphael, but his writing here does explain one part of the mystery of Kubrick's last, disappointing, film _Eyes Wide Shut_. Time after time, watching the film, I found myself wondering who had done the &quot;updating&quot; of the 1920s source material to supposedly contemporary Noo York; contemporary except for oddities like the man at the party attempting to seduce Nicole Kidman by talking that naughty Mr Freud at her. Mr Freud was terribly modern, once, and no doubt he was a source of fashionable conversation, including talk intended to seduce, in Vienna in the 1920s. But in up-market New York in 1999? No, Mr Raphael; not for a long, long time. Raphael's &quot;seducer&quot; would have driven Kidman's character, a literate, urban sophisticate, not to titillated shock but to incredulous laughter. But Mr Raphael's writing in this memoir is so tone deaf, so unaware of the impression he is making, that it explains the tone deafness of much of the _Eyes Wide Shut_ script. <br />That creates a new mystery, which is why Kubrick gave the job to a writer so modestly talented. Kubrickian hubris, I think, is the answer; Kubrick avoided talented actors (after _Dr Strangelove_,at least, and with the possible exception of _Clockwork_'s Malcom McDowell), perhaps with the idea of making sure that all the magic on the screen was clearly his. Avoiding talented writers is a next logical step, but one that is more damaging to the final product. <br />Why more damaging? Because scriptwriters are not only much more important than actors, which should go without saying, but also more important than directors. The credit &quot;A film by ...&quot; should surely go to the writer(s) and to no-one else. The director should get an authorship credit to the extent that he or she worked on the script, as I believe Kubrick generally does. Directors of movies are as important as the directors of Shakespeare plays; and though those directors are creative and egotistical people, they rightly don't claim authorship of another person's ideas, vision and words. Raphael's trade is an honourable one, even if he himself is no great ornament to it. Though to be fair his earlier _Two for the Road_ isn't a bad script.<br />I might have given this book two stars, because it gives a few glimpses of Kubrick, a notoriously private man. Even though the glimpses aren't at all illuminating, and though the book is short it's still a dull, dull read. But it loses one of its stars, not so much for cashing in on the fame of a recently-dead man, which in itself would do no great harm, but for the bad faith and ill-will of using Kubrick to sell a book while at the same time trying to build up Raphael at Kubrick's expense. <br />Not recommended, even for fanatical Kubrickians. <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2001-05-09

A famous example, given here, is the soiree where the guests - not Wagner's guests, by the way - briefly paid attention to another person in the room.  Wagner solved the problem by screaming, literally, with rage; when the astonished company turned back to Wagner he carried on his &quot;conversation&quot;, or monologue, as if nothing had happened.  Other less well-known stories appear here, illustrating a similar outrageousness.  The ugly and unpleasant antisemitism is also fully represented.  Though the different excerpts all find this mercurial man in different moods, all accounts have one thing in common: the writers are all aware that they have just encountered something absolutely extraordinary.<br />Not appearing is (I've forgotten the original source and the exact form of the quote, though it's cited in a well-known article on Wagner by Deems Taylor) Wagner's own observation on what people who put up with his demands, financial and emotional could expect: they were well recompensed because they would be able to tell stories about having known Wagner, for the rest of their lives.  He was right, of course, as this book, among thousands of others, so richly proves.<br />This is an excellent portrait and resource book, offering a more vivid and arguably truer picture of Wagner than any of the available biographies.  (Wagner may be the historical figure of whom secondary sources are most unreliable.  With Wagner it ALWAYS pays to read the original source and NEVER to trust the commentator, some of whom should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.)<br />A fault is that we should have heard more from the musicians who knew Wagner: not the fellow composers, whoseanecdotes are mostly well-known and appear here once again, but the orchestral players and others who played under him or worked with him at London, Dresden and of course Bayreuth: more especially on his rehearsing of the _Ring_ would have been most welcome.  Among musicians Wagner is not only at his best as a human being, but also his most fascinating as a talker.  His obiter dicta on his contemporaries, and even more on his great ancestors, are worth the price, but there could comfortably have been more.<br />Still, a book which is both a fascinating read for the Wagner neophyte and a useful resource for the Wagner scholar: a great combination and an excellent book.  Highly recommended.<br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2001-05-07
US	50448822	R3UO0PWDFPW9LQ	0091343909	401828218	Jake's Thing	Books	4	8	9	N	N	A nice title	The title is of course nice, in the sense of precise, referring to the way a counsellor might euphemistically refer to Jake's &quot;problem&quot;, his impotence, also to Jake's penis, and also perhaps to Jake's attitude.  <br />This was the first of the trilogy of Amis Pere's trilogy of deeply angry, anti-humanist and misogynist novels (the others being _Stanley and the Women_ and _Russian Hide and Seek_), and perhaps the funniest.  The objects of Amis' satire (trendy doctors and counsellors, the &quot;helping professions&quot; in general) surely deserve the contempt Amis heaps on them, though the satire sometimes spills over into what seems like genuinely felt and personal rage, not quite mediated or controlled by the authorial &quot;voice&quot;.  But the various appalling and undignified therapies to which Jake is subjected in the attempt to restore his libido are evoked with comic splendour and I suspect bulls-eye accuracy.  Jake's mind, body and intelligence are in every sense insulted.     <br />Along with _Girl, 20_, with its evocation of 1960s &quot;swinging London&quot; this is the most obviously dated of Amis' novels, though perhaps that doesn't matter much from this distance.  What was once trendy (or rather anti-trendy in relation to specific forms of trendiness, which is essentially the same thing) becomes dated, and finally comfortably historical.  <br />Though possibly one of the least of Kingsley Amis' novels, and one that shows the man himself at a low ebb (a certain humanism returns with _The Old Devils_ and the last novels, and Amis is much the better for that), this is still a comic masterpiece.  No writer has ever done dialogue, and especially dialogue-as-strategy, talk as point-scoring and jockeying-for-position, as well as Amis.  Below-par Amis still offers a much better read than most novelists at their peak. <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2001-05-06

There were two great ages of English translation: the Elizabethan period, and the last 30 years.  <br />After the Elizabethans we had the Augustans, who suffered from straitness of form (Homer in heroic couplets? No, his River of verse won't fit into that series of Beakers of verse, though Pope's are the very Best heroic couplets), or the Victorians, who offered us either the faded roses of Augustan couplets, or of Romantic lyricism; and on top of that they bowdlerised.  Aristophanes never made a dirty joke, according to his Victorian translators, and even when reading a relatively chaste author like Tasso, in Victorian guise you know that at least half of the human condition won't be there, regardless of what Tasso actually wrote.  <br />You'll notice I've skipped an age.  Yes, the Romantics were also great translators, but they translated only what they needed.  Byron gives us one canto of Italian epic; Shelley gives us one Euripedes play, and segments of Dante or Goethe; neither settle down for the drudgery of translating an entire epic.  (Except in the sense that Byron's _Don Juan_ is a version of Ariosto, just as the poem Christopher Logue wrote called the _Illiad_ is a version of Homer without being truly a translation.  <br />The Elizabethans had the fire and the patience, and they had no need to lie to their readers as the Victorians had.  Their freedoms, as those that Fairfax took, are justified by their immersion in the spirit of the poems they English'd.<br />And the greatest Elizabethan translations are... Well, Marlowe, obviously: Marlowe's incandescent version of Book 1 of Lucan's _Pharsalia_, and his versions of Ovid's _Amores_.  But other than Marlowe, the great Elizabethan translation is by Edward Fairfax, his version of _Gerusalemma Liberata_.  <br />This is one of the great English translations, counting Barbara Reynolds' _Orlando Furioso_ and Dryden's _Aeniad_.  Fairfax gives us Tasso's seriousness, his occasional humour, and also (surely as mucha model for Spencer's _Faerie Queen_ as Tasso's own Italian text was) Tasso's erotic sensibility.  Ariosto's eroticism was frankly acknowleged, part of the life of any sane Paladin, while the sexiness in Tasso is vested in the supposedly &quot;bad&quot; characters, like Alcina: and thus both more powerful and more sexy.  <br />An outstanding feature of Fairfax's astonishing translation is his concision; he finds himself time and again with spare room in his English ottava rima, which gaps he tends to fill with new similes, alliterative examples and poetic diadems, suggested by Tasso but not quite found there.  Where most translators who attempt to use the same form as their model struggle to keep up, Fairfax is in such control that he has resources (and syllables) to spare.  His use of those syllables gives us a kind of improvement on Tasso.  (I have heard Italians say this, so I'm prepared to let it stand.)  That is, there is actually more in Fairfax, stanza by stanza and Canto by Canto, than there is in Tasso.  Where Tasso lists two examples, for instance, Fairfax lists three.  His invention is never independent of Tasso's text, but rather decorates the original text without holding up the speedy flow of the action.  We would censure this freedom in a later translation, but Fairfax's other advantage is that he is an Elizabethan.  His freedom is in keeping with Tasso's own adaptations of earlier poets, and of Fairfax's own day.  <br />But I have followed Fairfax with Tasso in Italian and a crib, and I can report that his occasional small freedoms are never in contravention of the sense of Tasso's poetic flow, but always in its service.  <br />As well as giving us great and accurate poetry, Fairfax follows Tasso's form, presenting us with a stanza for stanza translation, eight lines of ABABABCC ottava rima for eight lines of ABABABCC ottava rima.  In doing so (and in his extreme mastery of that form) Fairfax lit a fuse that travelled underground in English before exploding in Byron, and again in Reynolds' unexcelled Ariosto translation.  <br />There are other Tasso translations, but only one, ever in the history of Englsh poetic translation, that captures Tasso's mix of lightness and earnestness, and above all Tasso's febrile religious sensuality.  This is one of the three or four truly great English translations.  I recommend it above any other version of Tasso.  Great poem; the greatest (in English) in this version. <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2001-04-27
US	50448822	R1JMRWJEN437L7	0140443118	527659315	Orlando Furioso: A Romantic Epic: Part 1 (Penguin Classics) (Pt. 1)	Books	5	81	89	N	N	Reynold's is one of the classic English translations	I may not have been the only person to have noticed how much the poetry improves in the last half of _Paradiso_ in the Dorothy Sayers translation.  This is because Sayers died before completing the last of her translation of the _Divina Commedia_, and her devoted friend and admirer Barbara Reynolds took over.  But where Sayers had been technically impressive in matching Dante's terza rima, but pedestrian in the poetry, at the point where (as I guess) Reynolds takes over a new lightness of touch and poetic feel for the language makes itself felt.  <br />This Ariosto translation is Reynolds' great achievement.  Moreover it is one of the three or four greatest literary translations in English, an achievement to stand beside Dryden's _Aeniad_ and Fairfax's _Gerusalemma Liberata_.  (On Pope's _Illiad_, which I'm currently reading, I tend to agree with the contemporary reviewer who commented, &quot;A very pretty poem, Mr Pope, but you must not call it Homer&quot;.)  <br />She captures Ariosto's wit and lightness, occasionally turning in closing couplets for her stanzas that are as sharp as Byron's in _Don Juan_ (who was in turn also using Ariosto - among others - as a model), but also following Ariosto in allowing the sense to flow from stanza to stanza in a quite un-Byronic way.  As well, she manages to transmit Ariosto's graver passages in equally dignified verse, for example some of the set pieces imitated (by Ariosto) from Homer.  English readers tend to think of Ottava Rima as a vehicle for comic verse, but in Italian it is a model for epic.  It's just that the great Italian epic tradition, unlike the English epic tradition before Byron's great anti-epic, includes humour.  <br />As for Ariosto, he is a great poet and story-teller, and (not exactly a literary judgment, this) his authorial &quot;voice&quot; is one whose company you cannot help enjoying.  His humour, sometimes sly, is also warmly compassionate; sometimes satirical, sometimes splendidly and deliberatelysilly.  Ariosto knows his flying horses, invisibility rings, sexy sorceresses and the rest are perfectly absurd, but manages to maintain the fantasy elements as wonderful and exciting, without ever undercutting them with mere cynicism or bathos.  But most often the humour is warm and character-based.  <br />His story has an astonishing range of characters, the Moorish warriors and their lovers depicted as fairly and favourably as his Christian protegonists, and an astonish sweep, all over Europe and the East, with digressions to the Moon and other enchanted places.  <br />Another feature of Ariosto is his feminism, which shows in his warrior women, who give and take in battle every bit as well as the men.  He also tellingly mocks some of the anti-feminist aspects of chivalry, as in the scene where one of Ariosto's  heroes is called upon to champion in a trial by combat a woman who has been accused of unchastity.  The hero readily agrees to defend the woman's honour, but only after observing that he would as readily defend her if she were unchaste, as in his view (clearly also Ariosto's) women have a right to make love without being condemned for it.  <br />Two last observations.  First, I believe that this poem, and not Dante's, is the great Italian epic, superior to Dante for the same reason that Shakespeare is superior to Racine, or Byron's English epic is superior to Milton's or even Spencer's.  Dante offers moral allegory (though with a thoroughly repellant worldview), and Ariosto's failure to preach has sometimes been taken as a sign of lack of depth or seriousness.  But the great epics are about humanity, not allegory (though I have seen attempts to allegorise Homer, none have done so convincingly); and Ariosto presents one of the widest and greatest human canvases of all epic.  It is the most readable long poem since the _Odyssey_.  Yes. <br />Second, Amazon has linked this translation to another, a prose translation.  I haven't read the prose translation, but I would observe that _Orlando Furioso_ is a poem.  To render it as something else is to lose its structure, its purpose and its very nature.  To present a prose translation of this poem as a genuine &quot;version of Ariosto&quot; is a bit like presenting Beethoven's Ninth symphony by playing an arrangement for kazoo: some of Beethoven will come through in a kazoo transcription, but you cannot call it the Ninth.  Get the Reynolds; it is a great and easy _read_, and it is one of the glories of English poetic translation.  <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2001-04-27
US	50448822	R1B74VXLV5UXCS	0879759844	171804759	Why I Am Not a Muslim	Books	5	95	111	N	N	An extra star for courage	... My own first reactions, on seeing this book, was delight that it existed, followed by fears for the author's life.  That such fears are necessary and realistic only confirms a great deal of Ibn Warraq's criticism of the state of contemporary Islam.  <br />This book outlines the current role of Islam in maintaining various dictatorships that murder and torture their own citizens while threatening their neighbours; in promoting the mutilation and oppression of women and the murder of anyone who dares to question either the basis of the faith or the activities of some adherents.  Some reviewers have argued that these things are done by governments, not by the religion, but this would only be valid if church and state were separate in those countries.  They are not; the dictatorships in Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Libya, Ethiopia, Afganistan and elsewhere govern hand in hand with Islamic leaders, or else the Mullahs rule directly.  Thus, to credit Islam with the atrocious things done by Islamic Governments is not guilt by association but placing guilt squarely at its source.  <br />Even relatively tolerant and stable countries like Malaysia maintain such peace and freedom as they do in spite of Islam, not because of it.  As the clique currently running the Malaysian Government become more desperate many Malaysians expect them to turn to the Mullahs, who will provide violent supporters to beat up and murder the Government's critics in exchange for power to end such tolerance and freedom as Malaysia currently enjoys.  Meanwhile Indonesia's new-born democracy is under threat from an alliance between Islamic forces and the military.  It might be reasonable to conclude that if you wished to destroy a third world country's economy and infrastructure, shift it from peace and progress to civil war and poverty, end education and technological development, blight its present and future and make it dependent and powerless for generations to come, one of the most effectivemeans might be to put power and money into the hands that country's Islamic clerics.  <br />(Some reviewers have defended Islam by pointing out that the US also sponsors terrorism.  They are right: it is hypocritical to condemn only one side's support for murder, but that argument backfires on Islamic apologists as well.  The thing is to condemn ALL terrorism.)  <br />But Ibn Warraq mainly looks at Islam's origins and early history, not the present, and this is the most enlightening part of the book to most readers.  He shows that Islam's horrific manifestations are not a perversion of Islam, as I had naively thought, but flow logically from its scripture and doctrines.  Since Christianity was the form of religious belief that I rejected, I tended to be more aware of Christianity's faults than those of other religions.  For example I had believed that in the Crusades the aggression and atrocities were almost all on the Christian side, which Ibn Warraq shows is not entirely true, and that Islam had been a humane and tolerant religion before it came under Christian attack, which idea Ibn Warraq demolishes completely.  <br />I had been, I suppose, afraid that to attack Islam might be racist, or seen as such.  But Ibn Warraq argues convincingly that we should avoid double standards, and not be afraid to condemn evil or life-damaging nonsense regardless of the culture it arises from.  His very great courage has given me that small piece of courage.       I understand that Ibn Warraq has chosen his references to present the worst and most ignorant and murderous side of Islam, rather as if someone presented the doctrines of a US fundamentalist group as typical of Christianity as a whole.  That is a valid criticism, but Ibn Warraq shows how the extremes are a logical development from the scriptures.  And we need to know the worst as well as the best to know the whole.  <br />I spoke to many Muslims while considering taking up a job in Malaysia (I didn't, the already-repressive Government and the rise of Islamic influence being key reasons), and I know that many are quietly disgusted with things done in Islam's name, and would agree with much of what Ibn Warraq's says.  But I do not know of many Muslims who are prepared to come out and openly condemn the slave trades, the murders and atrocities and all the rest.  Until those Islamic voices make themselves heard on the side of decency (it will take courage, and many will be imprisoned, tortured or murdered), Islam will continue to be rightly tainted by those things.  There the solution is in the hands of moderate Muslims: if there are no voices for decency heard from within Islam, what can the rest of the world reasonably conclude? <br />Ibn Warraq's title deliberately echoes Russell's _Why I am not a Christian_.  Ibn Warraq does not write with Russell's clarity, and the book is in places poorly organised.  Nevertheless it contains much information that will be new to most readers.  I might have given it four stars, but it wins the extra star for courage; it's a brave book and a necessary one.  I wish Ibn Warraq and his family well, wherever they are, and I hope the guys who say &quot;peace be unto you&quot; never find you.   <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2001-04-22

Their admirers continue the quarrel long after the original protagonists are dead, often with more passion than the protagonists themselves.  Plato and Aristotle?s respective followers engaged in passionate mutual denunciation from medieval times to the C19th, though they couldn?t raise much heat now. Wagner and Nietzsche provide a 19th century example, Lennon and McCartney a twentieth century one.  The Wittgenstein-Russell break-up has to date bubbled under with fewer publicly noticeable manifestations (an example before Monk's book is the portrayal of Russell in Derek Jarman's entertaining film &quot;Wittgenstein&quot;), but we will hear more of it. <br />The breakup was really not that dramatic. Russell recognised Wittgenstein's brilliance and persuaded him to take up philosophy, treating him with considerable and apparently typical generosity at both a material and intellectual level. For a while the two men were colleagues and friends, until Wittgenstein broke away on finding his own philosophical direction.  Russell admired Wittgenstein's early work but was dismayed by the rest, considering it a journey into mysticism.  (And indeed Wittgenstein is one pavingstone on the road that led to Derrida, though fortunately he is much more than that.) <br />Their friendship ended with some anger and mutual disappointment but no real scenes, no dramatic denunciations.  Wittgenstein and Russell attended the same social events long after the breakup, including the famous incident where Wittgenstein waved a poker, threateningly in some accounts, at Karl Popper.  (Russell's stern, &quot;Wittgenstein, put that poker down!&quot; was easily the most sensible and ethically incisive remark made during that infamous meeting of minds, and Wittgenstein?s acquiescence suggests some lingering respect for Russell.) <br />The relative lack of heat between the actual protagonists has not prevented their followers from carrying on the dispute, though more on the Wittgensteinian than the Russellian side.  Wittgenstein founded a cult based around himself, and to some extent that cult-like aura remains, while Russell's style and fortunes were different.  Russell was the world's best-known philosopher and a leader of the world peace movement. His reputation and renown were vast in the 1950s and 1960s until his death in 1970.  As a result, by the 1980s Russell was as unfashionable as flared trousers.  Russell had no &quot;cult&quot; except in the different sense that mass phenomena like U2 or Madonna were &quot;cult figures&quot;.  Instead, Russell inspired one generation and was forgotten by the next. Russell's philosophical reputation is only recovering now from that late-twentieth century nadir (as are flared trousers). Meanwhile Wittgenstein's cult grew steadily, while remaining in many respects cult-like. <br />Monk?s book appears to be part of the Wittgenstein-Russell fall-out. Monk is the author of a very good and sympathetic biography of Wittgenstein, which does all the things that his two-volume biography of Russell (of which this is the second volume) fails to do.  Wittgenstein was an impossible man who caused enormous damage to many of his followers.  But Monk's biography rightly shows that Wittgenstein's worst is balanced by his best, and tries to reveal the human beneath the sometimes arrogant or vindictive or destructive behaviour. Similarly, Monk gives a sympathetic account of Wittgenstein's philosophy, showing why it is of enduring value. <br />His biography of Russell has none of these merits, and of the two volumes the second (&quot;The Ghost of Madness&quot;) is far the worse.  Monk presents us with Russell's vices (his vanity, his failures to see or sometimes sympathise with the human feelings of those around him, including his lovers and his family, who he on occasion treated appallingly badly), but with littleor no attempt at understanding, or placing these faults in perspective.  This is not to say that I think that any of the facts Monk has chosen to present are incorrect, or that there are not incidents here that make me think less of Russell. But I have read other accounts of what Russell was like, and it is clear that Monk has selected fiercely, avoiding stories that show Russell as funny, or decent, or kind.  Monk's Russell is simply a monster with none of the roundness of a human being: not a portrait but a caricature. <br />Monk's antipathy to Russell is so strong that he even despises Russell's virtues, inviting us to do the same. Russell turned to popular writing partly because he had given his money away to various good causes, from women's suffrage to the peace movement.  He lost his Cambridge post after being jailed for speaking against the First World War.  Monk tries to present Russell's courage in the cause of peace (he went to jail again, in that cause, in old age the 1960s), the generosity that made him poor, and his response to financial privation by writing, as faults: not merely valueless but actually disgraceful.  That won't do. <br />Similarly, Monk's account of Russell's philosophical work, after the split with Wittgenstein, is not explication but dismissal.  To Monk, Russell did some interesting but failed work in _Principia Mathematica_ and _The Principles of Mathematics_, which Monk presents rather as half-blind precursors to Wittgenstein.  Monk's Russell, unlike the real one, soon abandoned serious philosophical work.  In reality Russell's later work, on epistemology rather than mathematics, on the resigned compromises we must engage in when we say we &quot;know&quot; something, is (I observe and predict) leading the revival of interest in and appreciation of Russell.  Monk sees no value in this work, and indeed from a Wittgensteinian point of view it _has_ no value. <br />AJ Ayer concludes his own book on Russell as person and philosopher (recommended) by describing Russell as &quot;not a saint, but a good man&quot;. With all his faults and weaknesses, Russell deserved better than this book, in which Monk descends from biography to partisan hatchet job.  We still need a good, balanced, life of Russell using material that couldn't be used while key people were alive. The time for hagiography is past; but there is no real need for demonography either. <br />Cheers! <br />Laon	2001-04-21
US	50448822	RHP3N4J0DYK43	0246107154	269631191	New Apocrypha: Guide to Strange Sciences and Occult Beliefs	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Skepticism for fun at prophets	This is a magnificent book, a hugely entertaining look at pseudoscience and various kinds of occult/spiritual silliness, from Nostradamus to various &quot;psychic detectives&quot;, taking in eternal motion machines, various ludicrous but successful cults that would no doubt sue Amazon if I named them, Noah's Arc, Erich von Daniken, the incredibly strange people who claim to be UFO contactees, the secret codes that &quot;prove&quot; that Bacon wrote Shakespeare, and various other forms of nuttery along the way.  <br />Sladek's expositions of these beliefs are impressively researched, and his use of original sources to let his various cranks and charlatans speak for, and demolish, themselves is brilliantly effective and often hilarious.  <br />I found it a life-changing book.  I was already starting to wean myself away from various kinds of woolly thinking - eg taking Lyle Watson more or less seriously - but it wasn't just the extraordinary range of Sladek's material that impressed me, but how much fun the book was.  Sladek's obvious glee at challenging various kinds of straight-faced amd deeply serious nonsense is highly enjoyable - and contagious.  <br />Sadly, though (like the previous reviewer) I too was waiting for the encore, there isn't going to be one.  Sladek died in 2000.  His friend Michael Moorcock apparently suggested that Sladek write &quot;The New Apocrypha&quot;; perhaps Moorcock might provide us with the long-awaited sequel?  Anyway, Sladek's science fiction is also well worth reading, though this remains my favourite of his books.  <br />As for the feeble pun in my review title, it's a homage to Sladek, who does rather better.  His chapter on flying saucer cullts is headed, childishly but splendidly, &quot;Will U kindly FO?&quot;   <br />Grab this book if you find a copy.

US	50448822	RE28XKE1E4MGE	0451191145	604964480	Atlas Shrugged	Books	1	57	111	N	N	Ayn, Archer and Asimov	I'm reviewing this book as a novel, as something to read, not as a collection of ideas.  <br />And as a read, it's awful.  The &quot;characters&quot; don't  achieve even two dimensions, and their dialogue is - literally - unbelievable.  That is, time after time I'd come to the end of a speech, words that the writer put into the mouth of one of her cyphers, and ask myself, &quot;Is there any way to speak those words and sound natural?  Could you for a second imagine an actual live person saying something like that?&quot; <br />And I couldn't.  This is a science fiction novel in more senses than the author intends.  That is, it isn't about people but about robots, hence their lack of internal life, and robots constructed by aliens, hence their lack of convincing resemblance to human beings.  But does Rand intend something as subtle as that? Is the constant, jarring incongruity of her characters' words and actions some kind of intentional distancing effect?  I think not, because the writing is just as bad in the non-dialogue sections.  Sentence after sentence reads as if Rand dictated them while she had her mind on something else, an effect I also get when reading Geoffrey Archer.  In fact of all writers, Archer's thumpingly limp prose comes closest to Rand's.    <br />So why is this incompetently-written pot-boiler still in print, and why have 600-odd people ardently raved about its unapparent genius? <br />To get the answer let's compare Rand not with Archer but Asimov, the &quot;Foundation&quot; series.  There too, the writing is thin stuff, with characters that don't acquire the depth and texture of cardboard, and dialogue that clunks like a mouthful of rocks.  (Though Asimov's trilogy is significantly better written - though still bad - than &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;.) But what has carried the book is not really the &quot;characters&quot;, still less the author's style, but the &quot;ideas&quot;.  <br />But Asimov's idea, &quot;psychohistory&quot;, never gets beyond a shadow of an idea.  In Asimov's defence, &quot;psychohistory&quot; is more of a McGuffin, a plot device, than a seriously intended science.  Rand, on the other hand, takes her ideas seriously, and expects you to do the same, even though &quot;Objectivism&quot; is essentially a mix of Max Stirner's right-wing anarchism (no Kropotkinian collectivism for our Max) with Nietzschean stuff about how the herd hold back the really free human beings like the author and also the truly superior being who has been good enough to buy the author's book.  <br />But it is this aspect of the book that keeps it in print.  Neither Rand's nor Nietzsche's readers consider themselves part of the &quot;herd&quot; - you and me, I'm afraid - that each writer treats with such contempt.  It's the ultimate authorial suck-up; where a lot of writers leave their readers feeling challenged, perhaps even a little appalled by their own relative lack of powers (Shakespeare, for example, or even an Amis), Rand assures her readers that they're special, they're a breed apart, and that it's everyone else -- the herd, democracy, collectivism, morality, etc -- who is stopping them from doing the brilliant, great things that they dream of.  <br />Hence the book's great appeal to adolescents (see the nearly 600 reviews, below), also to people with, um, issues.  <br />Criticism of Rand is often said by the more passionate Rand cultists to be simply a matter of leftists attacking a right-wing writer, but that seems to be based on a misunderstanding, or more likely a bowlderisation, of Rand's ideas.  Rand was an atheist and in principle though not in practice a libertarian, just like them secular humanist liberals that so many Rand cultists hate.  In many respects she is closer to the non-Marxist left than to the god-fearing, pro-censorship, abortion-banning American Right that has adopted her.  My problem with Rand's ideas is not Whose Side They're On, but that her ideas were second-hand and second-rate,top-of-the-head stuff that was neither researched nor well written.  <br />Anyway it's ideological fervour, rather than any merit of plotting, characterisation of writing, that has kept this bnook in print.  So if you're approaching it at a level of, &quot;Is _Atlas Shrugged_ a good read, for a plane trip or winter evening?&quot; I'd say no.  Try Geoffrey Archer if you're in the mood for brainless crap (and that's a reasonable mood to be in); Archer certainly didn't have Rand's overweening pretention.  And if you want Big Ideas that turn out not to be very taxing at all, try Asimov's &quot;Foundation&quot; series.  Asimov isn't much of a writer either, but as you read him you can't help liking him for being a big engaging peach of a man, where Rand is a prune.<br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2001-04-16
US	50448822	R2GHSUNZW2QVBJ	0312195451	508861703	Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science	Books	5	179	201	N	N	Work went into research and writing; not hard work to read	Hard work to write, easy to read: instead of vice versa  November 2, 2000<br />This book is not, centrally, an attack on deconstruction, post-modernism, social constructionism and so on. It is instead a tightly focussed attack on some French writers who are often associated with those ideas, Lacan, Deleuze, Kristeva, Baudrillard and others.<br />Without confronting those writers' central ideas, &quot;Fashionable nonsense&quot; devastates their reputations. It shows them claiming authority in various scientific fields, using scientific &quot;expertise&quot; to enhance their authority and credibility, to bolster arguments on non-scientific propositions by analogy with scientific propositions, and to scare away dissenters. For example Lacan makes claims about topology for both his analogy and his argument on some matter concerning phallic psychology. Most readers, like me, would not know whether Lacan's topology was reasonable or absurd, but Sokal and Bricmont show that Lacan wasn't merely &quot;inaccurate&quot;; he was &quot;meaningless&quot;.<br />It's reasonable to ask if Sokal and Bricmont are right about topology (and the other branches of science cited by the book's targets), while Lacan and the others were wrong. In a symposium in the November 2000 edition of &quot;Meta Science&quot;, hostile critics of &quot;Fashionable Nonsense&quot; confronted Sokal and Bricmont. But only one critic even attempted to dispute that the book's targets wrote ignorant nonsense about science. This was Lacanian, who attempted to defend Lacan's topology: and that sole attempted defence was clearly and crushingly rebutted. It seems clear that in its science the book's credibility is unshaken.<br />So Lacan's grasp of topology was so vague that he must have known that he couldn't make accurate and meaningful statements about it. But he went ahead, knowing that he didn't understand what he was writing. It follows that he was lazily and arrogantly relying on the likelihood that his readers wouldn't understand topology either. Therefore Lacan is guilty of intellectual fraud, or imposture, as in the original French title.<br />So what? First, if Lacan is prepared to use intellectual fraud to make and support arguments, then some of the intellectual indulgences that academics allow each other, for example too seldom checking references, should not apply. His credibility logically diminishes, to the extent that the only statements by him that should be given credence are those that are backed by specific and checkable references to matters of fact, or based on sound argument from cited evidence.<br />Second, this highlights the reality that Lacan (like the others skewered in this book) is peculiarly vulnerable to the withdrawal of intellectual indulgence. Once you decide to give credence only to those things in Lacan that are based on reasoning from evidence, as those terms are usually understood, what remains is little more than the residue of soap scum after the bursting of a glistening bubble. If I were to use Lacan's method I would write that soap bubble metaphor in more abstruse terms, stretch it for endless pages of waffle, and pretend that it was an argument or proof rather than merely a figure of speech. Also if I were Lacan, I would not look up the physics concerning soap bubbles and iridescence, but make something up and hope to get away with it.<br />This is why the narrowness of Sokal and Bricmont's approach is well chosen. Other writers could not be so damaged by the withdrawal of intellectual indulgence. Nietzsche, for example, can be shown to be wrong on matters of fact, and that where he bothers to reason at all his reasoning is faulty, and that his real attitudes (pro-war, anti-compassion, misogynist, antidemocratic, antisemitic, and so on) are not the fashionable doctrines often attributed to him. But he will survive unscathed because unlike these French philosophists, who write like bureaucrats even when making &quot;jokes&quot;, Nietzsche was a great writer. People like his wit, energy and poetic fire, and adolescent readers like the way he makes them feel superior to the &quot;herd&quot;. In a different way Frege or Hume (say) are also impervious to this sort of demolition. They could be shown to be wrong or even dishonest about some particular point, but this would not hurt the remainder of their work because in general their work does not depend on their reputations but on their reasoning.<br />But Sokal and Bricmont's targets are ripe for the &quot;Emperor's New Clothes&quot; effect. Scepticism, once thought uncool and a product of stupidity and the failure to understand these deep writers, is suddenly permissible. Instead of being impressed by thickets of words and assuming that something profound must be in there somewhere, we do the hard work of close reading, discarding the phrases that mean nothing, working out precisely what is being claimed and whether those claims are backed by evidence or reasoning. Sokal and Bricmont (and Sokal alone with his splendid if mildly unfair hoax, also documented here), can reasonably claim to have had more to do with that process than any other writers. Apoplectic attacks on deconstruction by conservatives only strengthened the false appearance that here was something radical, interesting, and probably hip.<br />But when Sokal and Bricmont's French wankers and their American acolytes return to an obscurity as deep as the obscurity of their texts, some of the ideas they espoused will remain. Post-structuralism and social constructionism pose respectable challenges to scientific positivism, that can be expressed clearly, that do not assume that the world is &quot;only text&quot;, but that argue that much of our understanding is socially constructed. Sokal and Bricmont did not attack those ideas.

People like his wit, energy and poetic fire, and adolescent readers like the way he makes them feel superior to the &quot;herd&quot;. In a different way Frege or Hume (say) are also impervious to this sort of demolition. They could be shown to be wrong or even dishonest about some particular point, but this would not hurt the remainder of their work because in general their work does not depend on their reputations but on their reasoning. <br />But Sokal and Bricmont's targets are ripe for the &quot;Emperor's New Clothes&quot; effect. Scepticism, once thought uncool and a product of stupidity and the failure to understand these deep writers, is suddenly permissible. Instead of being impressed by thickets of words and assuming that something profound must be in there somewhere, we do the hard work of close reading, discarding the phrases that mean nothing, working out precisely what is being claimed and whether those claims are backed by evidence or reasoning. Sokal and Bricmont (and Sokal alone with his splendid if mildly unfair hoax, also documented here), can reasonably claim to have had more to do with that process than any other writers. Apoplectic attacks on deconstruction by conservatives only strengthened the false appearance that here was something radical, interesting, and probably hip. <br />But when Sokal and Bricmont's French wankers and their American acolytes return to an obscurity as deep as the obscurity of their texts, some of the ideas they espoused will remain. Post-structuralism and social constructionism pose respectable challenges to scientific positivism, that can be expressed clearly, that do not assume that the world is &quot;only text&quot;, but that argue that much of our understanding is socially constructed. Sokal and Bricmont did not attack those ideas. They cleared away some writing that is unhelpful to the discussion of social constructionist and related ideas, demonstrating that some Big Names who were until recently considered central to the discussion were in fact merely passengers, and irrelevant to it. <br />Finally, why five stars? It's a narrower book than is sometimes claimed, but the tight focus was well chosen. It is solid and much needed work. It must have been difficult to research and write, but it is easy to read.

US	50448822	R3GKO58DMS372U	0671203231	224357917	Why I Am Not a Christian and Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects	Books	5	54	59	N	N	Great title, fine collection of essays, not a manifesto	Like some of the other contributors I have a fondness for this book which arises, I suspect, almost as much from the forthrightness of its title as from its contents. <br />The less positive reviews of this book mainly come from two directions. The first is that some people have been disappointed to find that the book is not a comprehensive case against Christianity, and includes &quot;irrelevant&quot; material. That's because the book is not a manifesto: it's simply a collection of essays on different topics, not all of them about Christianity. &quot;Why I am not a Christian&quot; is the title essay, not the theme of a connected book. In the same way the essay &quot;In Praise of Idleness&quot; is the title essay of Russell's book &quot;In Praise of Idleness&quot;, but someone who expects every essay in that entertaining collection to be about idleness will of course be disappointed. <br />Some of the other, stronger, comments appear to be manifestations of the odium theologicae, and unintentionally justify Russell's scepticism concerning the notion that monotheistic belief leads to tolerance, kindness, or even peace of mind. <br />In the title essay Russell outlines his ethical case for rejecting religion. That is, the idea of YHWH or Jehovah or &quot;God&quot; struck Russell as essentially a personification of all that is worst in humanity: cruel, intolerant, vengeful, violent, aggressive, an enthusiastic proponent of the slaughter of people who happen to live in other tribes or believe in a different version of YHWH, and certainly no friend of good things like intelligence, independence or beauty (or animals). Many decent Christians share Russell's ethical revulsion for the wars and persecutions brought about by Christianity and the other monotheistic religions, which continue to the present day. But where they set them aside as simply a human perversion of Christianity, Russell sees them as a logical consequence of a belief system that says that the most important thing for human beings is to be acceptable to the Christian god, and that the Christian god finds many human beings unacceptable, especially those with a different god, or no god, or &quot;incorrect&quot; beliefs about the Christian god. <br />And that ethical finding, of revulsion for intolerant monotheism, its deity and its effects, leads naturally to the question of why YHWH and similar supernatural persons or ideas should be worshipped. And once the question is asked, the arguments advanced for that being's existence, let alone its merit, turn out to be shonky stuff indeed. Russell covers and demolishes those arguments with admirable lucidity. Here I'll indulge myself by noting an attempt in one review to paper over the contradiction Russell points out in the first cause argument (Russell was not the first to point it out, of course) by saying that a first cause doesn't need a cause because of course it is in a different category from all the other causes. The flourish with which this &quot;category&quot; was introduced as if it stopped a chain of logic would have amused Russell, I think, as much as the invective directed against him in some of the other reviews. While the Aristotelian who cited Hawking in refutation of Russell's atheism, on the other hand, needs to read more carefully: Hawking's is a non-theist account of the Big Bang, which explicitly requires no Beginner.  <br />Some of the reviews note that Russell's piece is &quot;dated&quot;. They may mean that some of the terms in which the arguments are expressed have evolved, which is true: but I would suggest that the arguments themselves have not changed much, and to the extent that Russell's language is clearer than some recent philosophical writing, it is better. They may also have meant that Russell is dated because he rejected the German metaphysics and French linguistic play that was influential in the mid and late twentieth century and fashionable until the last couple of ticks of the cultural clock. But Russell's commitment to expressing philosophical ideas and arguments in the clearest possible language, which is linked to his positivism, is looking relatively shiny right now, while the Continental irrationalists and obfuscators (Derrida, Heidegger et al) are fading with astonishing speed. I wouldn't predict a revival in Russell's most important philosophical work, which he left unfinished, but I think his pursuit of clarity will remain admired.<br />Some of the other essays could more reasonably be called dated. For example one reviewer declares himself outraged by Russell's views on sex, citing the sentence, &quot;Prolonged virginity is harmful to women.&quot; Though a campaigner for women's rights, and progressive for his time, Russell was not immune to the sexism of the culture he lived in. Still, if Russell had said, &quot;Prolonged virginity is harmful to anyone&quot; the sentiment would still be controversial, and would hopefully still outrage that reviewer, but it would not then be dated. But there are very few writers before, say, 1980, who make regular and consistent use of non-sexist language, and in that Russell was not much ahead of his time. But even now British philosophical and scientific writers routinely use sexist language (&quot;men&quot; meaning &quot;people&quot; and so on), unlike their US or Australasian counterparts, and they have considerably less excuse than Russell.    <br />An aspect of the book that most reviewers have overlooked is its courage, in the title essay and deciding to name the book after that essay. Russell experienced discrimination and vilification for his atheism, and atheists are still subject to various kinds of discrimination (including in employment) and vilification in most Christian countries today, while in much of the Muslim world atheists face imprisonment, torture or death. Many young atheists are led to believe, by their schools, the media and often their parents, other family and friends, that they are the only person around who questions their culture's prevailing religion. And Russell's book, so long as theocrats in Iran, the United States and elsewhere permit its presence in libraries and bookshelves, is for many people one of the first indications that they are not alone.   <br />So I'm giving it five stars for its clarity, its courage, its historical role as a bringer of comfort and cheer to isolated young atheists, and for its entertaining writing. But before buying, people should know what to expect: this is a collection of essays, mostly written to earn a living by being entertaining and enlightening, and not a philosophical manifesto. <br />Cheers!<br />Laon	2000-10-18
US	50448822	RNTMAMD0OQ1J4	0525202870	288397045	Shelley: The Pursuit	Books	4	86	90	N	N	Interesting; valuable; dated	It's probably time for a new Shelley biography, despite Holmes' excellent work. I couldn't recommend this book without a number of caveats. <br />It was valuable in its time, for countering that Victorian view of the angelic  depoliticised and emasculated Shelley. But it's still a document of its  time. <br />There are two things that were wrong with the book even at the  time it was written. One is the constant failure to mention instances of  Shelley's extraordinary generosity and kindness to others. Maybe it was  boring, to a 1970s writer, to mention the old women carried in out of the  cold, the children fed, the money given away to strangers in hard times:  but to leave most of it out badly distorts the reality of Shelley. He was  no saint, but he was a remarkably kind person, and practical with it, and  that central and salient characteristic is glossed over, though  &quot;gloss&quot; is not quite the word. White's earlier biography is  actually more comprehensive on this sort of thing. <br />The second issue is a  grotesque mis-reading of the &quot;Adelaide Shelley&quot; affair, in which  Shelley put his name down as the father of an Italian baby. Holmes invents  from whole cloth an incident in which Shelley seduced the maid, turning her  out of the house when she became pregnant. This is simply bizarre, as  Holmes himself later acknowledged. In his next book, &quot;Footsteps&quot;,  Holmes concedes that not only was there no evidence in favour of this  claim, but that it would have been completely out of character for all  three of the key figures (Shelley, Claire Clairemont and the maid whose  name, from memory, is something like Paola Foggi) who would have had to  have been involved in Holmes' scenario. <br />The story, acknowledged by  Holmes to be false, did Shelley's reputation enormous harm (Paul Johnson  siezed on it, and added inaccuracies of his own, for his attack on Shelley  in the ludicrous &quot;Intellectuals&quot; book; Johnson's Shelley chapter  is virtually a cut and paste job from Holmes).  <br />So this has always  frustrated me: Why on earth hasn't Holmes corrected it in a later edition?  I suspect that Holmes feels that it is a form of integrity, of trueness to  himself as a young man, or something, to leave the book in its current  form. But since the book is supposed to be a record about Shelley, not  Holmes, I'd rather he made this and other corrections. <br />As well as that,  there's new information about the circumstances of Shelley's break with his  family, and about his life in Italy, which Holmes doesn't include, because  they are based on documents that have only recently come to light or been  studied. <br />So while this was a landmark in its time, it is from this  distance not as good as some earlier biographies, and it is due for  replacement. If I were to recommend a biographical work to someone with a  strong interest in Shelley, I'd recommend his Letters.<br />Laon (no relation)	2000-05-01

It was like a little airplace, far away. It would stop when I put the book down.  That was when I got it. It was the sound of the author, whining. <br />Though I  have to admit that I am immensely glad I didn't have the misfortune to be  born into the family of Richard Wagner's descendents; it sounds a ghastly  family.  But this is a book without insight, into the family or into  himself. Gottfried Wagner should have written it, addressed it to his  father, and then ... thrown it away. It's best to write angry personal  letters, to get the bile out, but never send them. Certainly, he should  never have published it (nor should his publishers), and when he reflects  I'm sure he finds this book immensely embarrassing.   <br />Needless to say,  there are no insights into his ancestor, the composer Richard Wagner, here.  We know what Wagner would have made of Hitler, because Wagner actually knew  the ancestors of Nazism: Adolph Stoecker, Bernard Foerster and so on. He  expressed utter contempt for them both in public and in private, and  avoided being associated with them. Wagner's descendents were certainly not  following in the tradition Wagner himself set, when they feted Hitler.  <br />Maybe there is one tiny insight of relevance to Richard Wagner in this  book: it is that on both sides of his bitterly divided family, he was  unlucky in his descendents. <br />Laon	2000-02-10
US	50448822	RR2NE4QU1DM3Y	0300076401	815088499	Nietzsche and Wagner: A Lesson in Subjugation	Books	1	64	75	N	N	Incoherent, ignorant, incompetent	Once in a lifetime a book comes along ... that is so arm-wavingly silly that it's almost Pythonesque. This book, \\"Nietzsche and Wagner: a Study in Subjugation\\" is actually less reliable than Robert Gutman's or Marc  Weiner's Wagner books, which were previously the record-holders. But Kohler  beats them hollow. I'm sorry to say that this book has the scholarly merit  of a UFO abduction memoir.   <br />Kohler doesn't even bother to try to  substantiate his various untrue and silly claims. One of these claims is  that Nietzsche was homosexual, for which Kohler (as several critics have  pointed out) adduces no evidence at all. Maybe Kohler thinks that Nietzsche  calling a book \\"Die Froeliche Wissenschaft\\" (The Gay Science) makes  Nietzsche \\"gay\\" in the current sense. (The meaning of \\"gay\\" seems to be  changing again, but that's another story.) But we have plenty of evidence  of Nietzsche's heterosexuality and no evidence at all of same-sex desire or  practice. Nietzsche was a misogynist, hostile and contemptuous towards  women, also clearly afraid of them, but that doesn't make him homosexual.  Kohler seems to think that claiming something is the same as making it so.    <br />Kohler also claims that after the Nietzsche-Wagner split Wagner  conducted a relentless and vindictive campaign against Nietzsche on the  grounds that he (Nietzsche) was homosexual. Again, Kohler doen't support  this claim of a homophobic campaign by Wagner with any evidence. But then,  how could he? There was no such campaign. Instead there was the famous  letter from Wagner to Nietzsche's doctor, expressing concern for the health  of \\"our young friend N.\\"and suggesting that Nietzsche's nervous problems  might be caused by excessive masturbation. <br />Wagner's letter is splendidly  dotty, but it also brings Kohler's claims crashing to the ground. (1)  Masturbation is not the same thing as homosexuality. Wagner did not think  Nietzsche was homosexual; instead, prescient in so many things, Wagnerwas  the first major thinker to call Nietzsche a wanker (just kidding, Nietzsche  fans). (2) A kindly meant, if eccentric, letter to Nietzsche's doctor is  not quite the same thing as persecution. It's clear from Cosima Wagner's  Diaries that Wagner's private reaction to the split with Nietzsche was  regret, a wish to have the breach healed, and an undoubtedly patronising  pity for &quot;that poor young man&quot; Nietzsche. These are not the sort  of feelings that lead to persecution or a campaign of vilification, as  Kohler claims.<br />As well, Wagner's actual attitude to homosexuals (there  were no gays in the 19th Century) is suggested in an earlier letter to a  homosexual friend. Wagner suggests that his friend \\"try to cut down a  little, on the pederasty\\"... The attitude is one of amused tolerance, which  won't do now, but it was progressive and liberal by the standards of his  time. Wagner wasn't a homophobe. <br />In fact Wagner didn't respond in public  to Nietzsche's repeated attacks (except once, a very indirect reference in  one of his essays, without mentioning Nietzsche's name); contra Kohler, the  abuse was very much a one-way street, and not in the direction that Kohler  suggests. <br />Kohler also presents a Nietzsche who wrote antisemitic  passages in his works during the alliance with Wagner, but who stopped  after the split. This is simply and flagrantly untrue. The post-Wagner  Nietzsche attacked antisemites, but he also continued to attack and insult  Jews. There are many, many antisemitic passages in Nietzsche's work -  Nietzsche fans, like Kohler and the reviewer from Kirkus Review quoted  above, like to overlook Nietzsche's antisemitism, but antisemites find  Nietzsche a useful supporter and resource. You'll find plenty of  antisemitic quotes from Nietzsche on proud display on the Web's neo-Nazi  sites, and the vast majority of these antisemitic passages were written  AFTER the split with Wagner. <br />And there's Nietzsche's attack on Wagner in  which he claimed that Wagner had a Jewish father. There is irony, of  course, in claiming an antisemite has Jewish parentage. But it reflects  what Wagner himself seems to have believed, that the man who was almost  certainly his real father, Ludwig Geyer, was Jewish. For this attack  Nietzsche must have drawn on his private conversations with Wagner, in  which Wagner poured out personal fears to a man he believed was his friend.  The nastiness in Nietzsche's attack is in the betrayal of confidence, not  in the claiming that Wagner had a Jewish parent. <br />I mention this attack  by Nietzsche, couched in antisemitic terms and involving personal betrayal,  because Kohler skips blithely over it. Imagine what he'd said if it had  been the other way round; Wagner attacking Nietzsche in antisemitic terms  while betraying an intimate confidence. But in fact there are suspiciously  few quotes of any kind from Nietzsche in Kohler's book. Given the book's  profound ignorance of the details of Nietzsche's or Wagner's life and  philosophies, I suspect this is not so much because Kohler wants to keep it  simple, but because he is not particularly familiar with his subjects'  work. Given the sort of book he's written, he didn't need to be. <br />By the  way, an earlier book by Kohler, that's only just been translated into  English, \\"Wagner's Hitler\\", is now available. Friends who've read the  German edition tell me that it's even more fanciful, nonsensical, dishonest  and incoherent than this book. I'll look for it in a remainder bin. <br />Laon	2000-01-13

It takes a weird translator to want to render it into English as &quot;Earthball&quot;. H Ashton Ellis is that translator, a man who, in  learning German, forgot all his English. Ellis translates German compound  words not with plain English but with strange Germanic formulations, eg  &quot;leg-dancers&quot;, or &quot;tone-arranger&quot; for a German word  that simply means &quot;composer&quot;.  So while it's good to have these  Wagner texts available in English, it's a shame that the re-appearance of  these awful translations in a modern edition will publishers from  commissioning a new, competent, plain-English translation discourage.  Ellis also makes Wagner's &quot;Das Judentum in Musik&quot; harder to  evaluate by introducing antisemitic overtones (perhaps of his own) where  the Wagner text doesn't justify it. For example, the Ellis text describes  Mendelsohn as  &quot;a Jew composer&quot;, which has a hostile, sneering,  sound to it. But Wagner's text has &quot;Judaische&quot;; the correct  translation is the merely descriptive &quot;a Jewish composer&quot;. There  are other, similar examples.<br />As for Wagner, &quot;Das Judentum in  Musik&quot;'s argument is that because [in mod-19th Century Europe] Jews  are partly involved in the cultures amongst which they live, and are partly  separate and aloof from them, their music and poetry don't have the warmth,  depth and humanity that come from having strong folk roots; Jewish art,  while Jews remain apart and not assimilated into the mainstream  &quot;folk&quot;, is likely to be imitative, clever, ironical, and so on,  but not deep or passionate.<br />The essay brings no comfort to  Wagner-lovers, but not quite as much comfort to Wagner-haters as is  sometimes claimed.  Some people, by no means antisemitic, eg Patrick Magee,  defend Wagner's analysis (stripped of its few paragraphs of merely racist  writing). The essay makes an argument about the need for art to have folk  roots if it is to be great. Me, I'd say its too easy to find  counter-examples, for Wagner's analysis to stand. Personally, if I were to  defend any part of the essay it would be Wagner's valuing of sincere  emotional expression in art over irony. We're starting to hear the phrase  &quot;post-irony&quot;, but it's not yet a reality. I'd welcome a trend  back to having the courage to express emotion, in life as well as art,  without always hiding behind quote marks. One of Wagner's merits is as  supreme non-ironist.<br />But, point out the detractors, rightly, there's a  strong thread of antisemitism in amongst Wagner's discussion of culture and  of art in this essay. There is a tone of &quot;balance&quot; in most of  Wagner's paragraphs, an assumption of the mask of mere intellectual  curiosity over the odd position of Jewish musicians and poets in the  mid-19th Century. But in some paragraphs animosity shows through  undisguised.<br />On the other hand, the essay is not the same thing as the  political antisemitism that had its horrifying culmination under the Nazis.  Wagner's subject was the arts. And his proposed &quot;remedy&quot; was for  Jews to assimilate into the mainstream population and lose their separate  identity. That's a despicably racist idea (why should they, if they don't  want to?), but it's diametrically the opposite of what the Nazis called for  - racial segregation followed by mass murder.  Reading it, you'll find that  the essay contains specific offensive passages, and is permeated by ideas  we now find offensive, but that it is not simply a screed of racial or  religious bigotry; mostly the text argues about art and music.  In sum,  anyone who loves Wagner's music will wish he'd never written or published  &quot;Das Judentum in Musik&quot;. It disfigures the man's posthumous  reputation. But nor is it quite the screed of racial vilification it is  sometimes made out to be. Wagner was a bigot and a crank, but not a  monster. The book gets three stars, because though it is an appalling  translation of a bad essay, it does at least make this infamous essay  available for people to judge it for themnselves.<br />Laon	1999-08-06
US	50448822	R3NXPA5Y2BWXOR	0670598895	466986942	Ring Resounding	Books	5	15	15	N	N	A very fine book	It's an unexpected thing to say about a backstage book (not a genre I'm fond of) but this is an inspiring book about artistic collaboration, and a dream fulfilled.  <br />The recording it celebrates can now be seen to be not  without its flaws. For example it's tragic that Hotter's vast voice had  gone &quot;woofy&quot; by the time they recorded Walku:re, the last of the  cycle to be recorded. Despite the awesome conviction and power of Hotter's  vocal acting, he wasn't beautiful, and the transformed Wotan at the end of  Act III has to be beautiful. And it's a shame that they replaced Paul  Kuen's excellent, musical, Mime with Gerhard Stolze's over-the-top  cackling, which has not worn well with time. <br />But the Culshaw book helps  put these flaws (and I can't bring myself really to consider Hotter a flaw,  on balance) into perspective against the grandeur of the achievement -  which, though complete Ring cycles are now common, remains unchallenged.  <br />Culshaw himself is a fine, clear and sometimes amusing writer and, it  seems, a likeably modest and decent man. For example he kindly withholds  the name of the tenor, a potential superstar as Siegfried, who nearly  killed the project by refusing to study his role. It's now known that that  was Ernst Kozub, by the way, and you can consider Culshaw's claims about  the magnificence of his voice by listening to his Erik on the Klemperer  &quot;Fliegende Holla:nder&quot;. He must be kicking himself to this very  day. On the other hand, the story of Wolfgang Windgassen's artistic  integrity and decency in stepping in and singing to save the recording,  even while his agent was still working out the contracts, only adds lustre  to the excellence of his performance. And if it were in a movie (&quot;The  hell with this; I'm going in to sing&quot;) no-one would believe  it.<br />Kirsten Flagstad appears as perhaps the most loveable soprano, or  singer of any kind, I have ever heard of, and the story of her death still,when I read it again, brings tears to my eyes. Culshaw's considerably more  guarded treatment of Birgit Nilsson, undoubtedly a fine artist, tells a  very different story... <br />It's also inspiring to read about record company  management who were not solely motivated by the bottom line. Perhaps  nowadays that would see the book classified as science fiction. :) <br />Good  book. The best of it's kind. Recommended. (And they should re-print  it.)<br />Laon	1999-07-31

Though Ronald Taylor's &quot;Wagner&quot;, and Barry Millington's Wagner biography (sold on this site) are both better. <br />Where Gutman's book falls down is in his  tenditious interpretations of &quot;the mind and music&quot;. <br />Here are  two examples. <br />1 There is a misprint in Act 1 of &quot;Tristan und  Isolde&quot;: Isolde says that she spared Tristan's life (after she  recognised the mortally wounded Tristan as the man who killed her husband)  only so  that the man who next won her (Isolde) could kill Tristan. The  correct sense is obvious from the context. However, a misprint in the text  has &quot;ihn&quot;, not &quot;ihm&quot;. With &quot;ihn&quot;, Isolde  seems to say that she spared Tristan's life so that the man who won _him_,  not her, could kill him. <br />There are three possible interpretations, here:   (a) There is a misprint, not too surprising in a long sentence with  complicated syntax. Gutman even acknowledges that Wagner seldom bothered to  correct misprints once they'd got into print;<br />(b) Isolde means to insult  Tristan, calling him a woman, or homosexual, who could be &quot;won&quot;  by another man; or<br />(c) There is an entire subplot, involving a homosexual  triangle between Tristan, his uncle King Mark, and his treacherous  &quot;friend&quot; Melot, established before Isolde arrived, and which is  not referred to in Wagner's text or music anywhere except for this one  &quot;n&quot; instead of an &quot;m&quot;: &quot;ihn&quot; instead of  &quot;ihm&quot;.  <br />Of these three options, (a) is overwhelmingly most  likely, followed very distantly by (b), while (c) is beyond far-fetched,  and merely silly. Gutman chooses (c), an example of the kind of decision,  when evaluating evidence, that recurs throughout his book. <br />Another  example involves the HG Wells Literary Time Machine. Gutman wants to read  &quot;Parsifal&quot; as a racist, antisemitic parable. To do this he has to  ignore Wagner's text and substitute a plot of his own. In Wagner's  &quot;Parsifal&quot;, Amfortas is wounded by the Spear that pierced Christ  in the side, when he (Christ) was on the cross. This contact with Jesus'  divine blood, through the agency of the Spear, causes Amfortas permanent  agony; as a mere sinner he cannot cope with this contact with the Divine.  <br />In Gutman's &quot;Parsifal&quot; Amfortas is actually injured by sexual  contact with a woman called Kundry, and his wound won't close because of  the mix of Amfortas' superior and Kundry's inferior blood. Problems with  this include: <br />(1) the wound was dealt by a Spear, not by sexual contact  - because of an interruption there was no sexual contact anyway; <br />(2)  Amfortas specifically says his problem is his inability to cope with the  contact, through the wound, with the Divine; <br />(3) At the climax of the  opera, Amfortas' wound is healed &quot;by the Spear that caused it&quot;;  <br />(4) Kundry is a sinner, like Amfortas, but there's no suggestion that  she has &quot;inferior blood&quot;, or (which is what Gutman is really  getting at) that she is supposed to be a Jewish character. In Act II,  Klingsor points out that in one of Kundry's past lives she was Gunndryggia,  a Valkyrie (just like Bru:nnhilde!) If Gutman is suggesting that Kundry and  her sisters, the Valkyries, are supposed to be Jewish characters, and  antisemitic caricatures at that, that could perhaps lead to an interesting  re-reading of the &quot;Ring&quot;. <br />But Wagner's text makes it clear  that Kundry has been many people in many lives, and does not represent any  particular racial identity. And she's always been the most faithful,  enduring and bravest of the Grail's servants, except when under Klingsor's  enchantment; though a sinner, she is nowhere presented as  &quot;inferior&quot;. The concept of &quot;inferior and superior  blood&quot; absolutely does not occur in &quot;Parsifal&quot;. It is not  there in the text, implied in the plot, or in the music. <br />Gutman,  however, wants to present &quot;Parsifal&quot; as a proto-Nazi work, and  even describes the Grail knights as a &quot;homosexual SS order&quot;.  We'll leave aside Gutman's use of slightly far-fetched  &quot;discoveries&quot; of homosexual content as a stick with which to beat  Wagner; homophobia was more acceptable in 1968, when Gutman's book was  written, than it is now. <br />What's more interesting is Gutman's Time  Machine. To back his case for his reading of &quot;Parsifal&quot;, Gutman  would like to have Wagner influenced by the racist philosopher Gobineau. If  Gobineau had influenced &quot;Parsifal&quot;, that would indeed be in a  racist direction. Unfortunately, Wagner wrote his first draft of  &quot;Parsifal&quot; in 1857, including much of the most important  dialogue; and finished the complete draft of the drama in 1877. We know  from Cosima's Diaries that Wagner first read Gobineau in 1881, four years  after he finished the text of &quot;Parsifal&quot;. Gutman's reading of  Gobineau into &quot;Parsifal&quot; involves time travel. It's an odd  mistake, given how often Gutman cites Cosima's Diaries. How could he not  know this? <br />Anyway, Gutman tends to use any old device, any old how, to  try to &quot;prove&quot; some of his points. And that's not a respectable  procedure, and makes the book unreliable in many respects.  <br />Laon	1999-07-22
US	50448822	R30X1SECQ37VXH	0233978704	531545450	Real Wagner	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Remarkable amount of information packed into small space	This is an excellent and useful book. Though there is some commentary by Sabor, the book is largely a compendium of quotes, mainly from Wagner himself, on different aspects of his life, views and work. <br />It's  surprising how complete a picture of Wagner's personality can be given in  this format. Wagner emerges, in my view accurately, as mercurial, utterly  inconsistent, and full of crank ideas. The most notorious of Wagner's crank  notions is his antisemitism, but he held to his Francophobia, his  water-cures, his advocacy - though not consistent practice - of  vegetarianism, just as fiercely. Sabor also quotes Wagner confessing that  these notions were &quot;a kind of poison he needed to get out of his  system&quot;, showing an awareness that they were not Wagner at his best.  <br />Sabor shows Wagner ready to flair into anger (with truly astonishing  tantrums) at a moment's notice, and equally swift to apologise; sometimes  playful, sometimes grumpy, remarkably like a child all his life. So the  long-suffering and devoted Cosima was a miracle not just for him, but for  us too. Without her patience we may never have had the finished  &quot;Ring&quot;, &quot;Meistersinger&quot; or &quot;Parsifal&quot;.  Sabor's quotes demonstrate the trials she went through, but also the  rewards. <br />Another miracle is how much information can be packed into a  relatively short book, in this way. The quotes are also illuminating on the  works, and on Wagner's musical and philosophical development. <br />And the  last miracle is how a man like Sabor, auther of a splendidly  well-researched commentary on the &quot;Ring&quot;, can have the modesty to  allow his subjects, largely, to speak for themselves. <br />Good book. <br />Laon	1999-07-22

He is astonishingly good on Wagner's sources, and on the draft processes Wagner went through as he transformed source material into his final forms.   Other books deal with different aspects of individual operas in more  depth, but this is still one of the books to start with. Everybody  interested in Wagner should  - well, the first thing to do might be to  listen to excerpts from &quot;Die Walku:re&quot;, &quot;Tristan&quot; or  &quot;Parsifal&quot;, say, and be awed by the music - but once you've heard  the music, if you're still interested, you should get this book.  <br />Laon	1999-07-19

But the essays are very good. Magee  is interesting on the notoriously strong emotional response, positive or  negative - people have to the music, and offers some thoughts on why this  is so. The essay, &quot;Jews, not least in music&quot; puts Wagner's  (in)famous essay &quot;Das Judentum in Musik&quot; into perspective, as  considerably less inflammatory than many people, who have perhaps only  heard the title, believe.  It's also interesting on Wagner's influence in  literature, poetry, painting, and so on.  The previous reviewer praises  this book in terms that would tend to put me off it: but really Magee is  not a difficult or abstruse read. His ideas are perceptive but written in  absolutely plain English. <br />And I don't think Magee would support the idea  that unless people have studied Wagner deeply they only &quot;think&quot;  they enjoy Wagner. Actually it's like Shakespeare; you can read a library  of commentary, and some of it, like Magee will be helpful, but you can also  just see or listen to the work itself, and find it perfectly  self-explanatory. Anyone who &quot;thinks&quot; they are enjoying Wagner is  right. <br />Magee's is a short book, just over 100 pages. It's an odd thing  about a man whose works are famous for their length, but the shorter books  about Wagner tend to be the best. <br />Laon	1999-07-14
US	50448822	R2WBB2I89IP2JU	0306805227	725200817	The Complete Operas Of Richard Wagner (The Complete Opera Series)	Books	3	38	41	N	N	Adequate; mediocre. Ernest Newman does same thing better.	Osborne gives some background on the writing of each of the mature Wagner operas. Then a quick plot summary, with some of the key musical themes.  Since a synopsis comes with every complete opera recording, I'm not sure  how useful these synopses are. We get too much explanation of plot and not  enough critical commentary, by my standards. And little in the commentary  is new; Ernest Newman's book &quot;Wagner Nights&quot;, though 50 or so  years older, is still a better introduction, making the same points as  Osborne, and more. <br />Not all the commentary is reliable; the chapter on  &quot;Parsifal&quot; buys into some of the nonsense first talked by Robert  Gutman about this opera (the Grail knights as homosexual SS order, and so  on), which has been comprehensively and devastatingly demolished by Lucy  Becket in her book &quot;Parsifal&quot;. <br />I find Osborne's  &quot;even-handedness&quot; a little irritating at times. &quot;Tristan und  Isolde&quot;, he says, is a masterpiece, though it's too long, of course.  That reminds me of Mozart's reply to the Emperor who thought his &quot;Il  Seraglio&quot; score had &quot;too many notes&quot;: &quot;Which notes do  you think I should take out?&quot; (I'm quoting the &quot;Amadeus&quot;  movie there, and from memory, so that's not quite what was really said, but  close enough.) Like Mozart, I find that a dumb comment, unless Osborne  cares to tell us which parts of &quot;Tristan&quot; etc we should do away  with to make it shorter. And I think the job of someone writing an  introduction to any composer is to be critical, certainly, but also to  communicate enthusiasm, not weariness. <br />So for new insights, Tanner,  Magee, Millington are better, and for &quot;sources, plot plot summary plus  musical commentary&quot; Newman is better. It's not actually bad, just  mediocre. Also, unlike Newman Osborne covers the first three Wagner operas,  &quot;Die Feen&quot;, &quot;Das Liebesverbot&quot; and &quot;Reinzi&quot;,so that's quite useful. <br />Laon	1999-07-14
US	50448822	R1NH76GWKS5RWJ	0571048188	73334350	Wagner's 'Ring' and its Symbols	Books	4	21	30	N	N	Don't take it too seriously; eccentric, sometimes insightful	To an even greater extent than, say, Freudianism, Jungianism involves a leap of faith. It isn't rational, let alone anything like scientific; it's another case where a charismatic person once came up with a set of  precepts, and the disciples follow them. But while I wouldn't recommend a  Jungian therapist to anyone I cared about (I'd expect no harm except to the  wallet; but little good either) Jungian analysis can be interesting when  its applied to myth; it is after all largely based on Jung's ideas about  myth. That makes Jungian ideas fairly apt for reading a myth-based work  like the &quot;Ring&quot;. <br />Robert Donington is a Jungian true believer,  and he applies Jung's ideas with considerable ingenuity and interest.  Sometimes he'll do anything to fit Wagner into the Jungian framework, so  that, for example, he'll read the very male dragon Fafner as &quot;the  mother in her devouring aspect&quot;. That's a pretty desperate reading:  Fafner is nobody's female principle, and only someone with a strongly  pre-determined agenda could try to make him one.  <br />Still, Donington is  often insightful. Why is there a brief reminiscence of Erda's theme when  Fricka appears in Walku:re Act II? Because, says Donington, Fricka is  somehow representing Erda's wisdom in this appearance. Fricka may not seem  wise, but on this occasion she is right. This and a hundred other small  insights makes this a worthwhile and constantly interesting book. It's also  very good on Wagner's mythological sources. <br />Donington is right in  thinking that the Ring is an endlessly complex and profound work; but  probably wrong in thinking that Jung holds the key. Still, while  Donington's overall reading is eccentric and not entirely reliable, this is  a very enjoyable and often insightful book. <br />Laon	1999-07-12

I'm not qualified to comment on that, except that Rose  doesn't bring out much evidence.<br />2 German political culture of the 19th  century is inherently and ineluctably antisemitic. I'd accept  &quot;largely&quot; antisemitic; but Rose wants to make an essentialist  case, that you couldn't be a 19th century German radical without being  antisemitic, and he fails to support that. Instead we get rhetoric, some of  it as heated as Wagner's own.<br />3 Wagner was always antisemitic, even  before 1850, when antisemitic references started to appear in his letters  and articles. There it's safe to say that the evidence disproves Rose's  case; see, for example, Jacob Katz's &quot;Wagner: The Dark Side of  Genius&quot;, a book which condemns Wagner's antisemitism on the basis of  better research and less tenditiousness. Not only does Rose not actually  make his case here, but he couldn't.<br />4 There is coded antisemitism in  Wagner's operas. Here Rose abandons all pretence to academic standards and  writes some very silly things. For example he argues that &quot;Die  Walku:re&quot; is antisemitic because it depicts incest and adultery  sympathetically; but adultery is against the Ten Commandments, and the Ten  Commandments is a Jewish document. Wagner's, and &quot;Die Walku:re&quot;'s  rejection of the 10 Commandments is therefore antisemitic. Where this  leaves Mozart, Verdi, Puccini, and every other opera librettist, poet and  dramatist in human history is not clear. By reasoning like this they must  all be antisemites. In &quot;Der Fliegende Hollander&quot;, Rose argues,  Senta's entire village is an antisemitic depiction, because they value  money over other values; therefore they must be meant as Jewish. When  someone starts looking for antisemitic depictions, and comes up with the  idea of a Jewish fishing village in the middle of the Norwegian fiords...  when arguments like that are seriously put forward, we know two things.  First, that the writer has lost the plot. Second, that the people who  should have read the book before publication and got rid of embarrassing  silliness like that, weren't doing their job.<br />I don't know much about  the history of 19th century antisemitism in Europe; but Rose's material on  Wagner is so hopelessly unreliable and ill-thought-out that it calls into  question the reliability of his other material.<br />There's another comment  on this book, apparently written by a believing Marxist, that claims that  Wagner made a mistake in making his gods and Nibelungs, in the  &quot;Ring&quot;, morally equivalent. No, that wasn't a mistake; that was  Wagner's _point_. Both the Nibelungs and the gods are involved in a  struggle between the values of love and the desire for power. Both the gods  and Nibelungs choose power, not love. Wagner was on the side of love, and  that is why he makes both sides fall.<br />Even though Wagner was a flawed  human being (but a human being, not a monster; he had a kind and  considerate side as well as a selfish and manipulative side), the  &quot;Ring&quot; is one of the greatest works of art ever created. And its  message is pacifist, pro-love and anti-power, and (ironically, given  Wagner's own racism) anti-racist, in showing the moral equivalence of all  the different struggling peoples in the &quot;Ring&quot;.<br />The writer of  the other comment is right to say that Wagner was a shallow and  inconsistent political thinker. But that means that not all of his ideas  are bad. His antisemitism shames Wagner's memory as much as the  antisemitism of Marx, Bakunin, Proudhon, Schubert, JS Bach, Schumann,  Chopin, Mussorgsky, Dostoevsky, TS Eliot and so on and so on, shames  theirs. But Wagner's defence of love over power, in the &quot;Ring&quot;,  strikes me as politically, as well as artistically, not without merit.<br />Rose makes a mistake in reading antisemitism into works that don't  contain it, and another mistake in not recognising that Wagner's works have  some moral merit which should not be thrown away.<br />Laonout merit.  <br />Rose makes a mistake in reading antisemitism into works that don't  contain it, and another mistake in not recognising that Wagner's works have  some moral merit which should not be thrown away. <br />Laon	1999-07-08

This ignores the fact that the  &quot;Ring&quot; depicts a struggle between love and the will to power, in  which both gods and Nibelungs value power over love, and are morally  equivalent. The gods are not &quot;good&quot;, nor the Nibelungs  &quot;evil&quot;. And Wagner is on the side of love, not power. (The Nazis  came to realise the gulf between their views and Wagner's, banning  performances of both the &quot;Ring&quot; and &quot;Parsifal&quot;  throughout the Third Reich, because they contained pacifist and  anti-militarist messages. Hitler's admiration for Wagner has been much  exaggerated; there's some evidence that he preferred Bruckner.)<br />Weiner's  basic misunderstanding of Wagner's ideas suggests limited acquaintance of,  or understanding of, the texts he's attacking. And his arguments are of a  standard you'd expect to find in alien abduction books, not scholarly  texts.<br />For example, on page 90 he argues that his &quot;Aryan&quot;  characters are associated with noble animals, including the &quot;magic,  superior dragon&quot;. On page 91 he remembers that Alberich*, who Weiner  thinks is an antisemitic caricature, is associated with dragons because he  once turned himself into one. So only a page later Weiner calls dragons  ignoble &quot;inferior&quot; animals, because that suits his argument.  Similarly, &quot;ravens&quot; are noble and therefore Aryan, according to  Weiner, when they are associated with Wotan; but he forgets that in  &quot;Meistersinger&quot; Walther compares Beckmesser to a raven. If  Weiner's &quot;rule&quot; about animals is correct, then Walther is  labelling Beckmesser as Aryan. But Weiner's &quot;rules&quot; are the  intellectual equivalent of paper tissues; you use them once and then throw  them away.  (*As early as 1907 George Bernard Shaw pointed out, correctly,  that Alberich is a Nibelung, one of an exploited people who work hard in  mines and factories; he represents the working class. 19th century  antisemites didn't think that Jews were exploited manual labourers. The  Nibelungs aren't Jews.)<br />Weiner consistently makes up rules, then discards  them after one use. For example, a rule for spotting &quot;Jewish&quot;  characters, says Weiner, is that they have poor eyesight. Mime, in  &quot;Siegfried&quot;, is described by Siegfried as having dripping eyes. I  read that as Mime crying to try to win Siegfried's sympathy, but yes, he  _might_ have poor eyesight. But Wotan appears in &quot;Siegfried&quot;, in  disguise, and meets Mime and Alberich (supposedly &quot;Jewish&quot;) and  Erda (supposedly &quot;Aryan&quot;). Mime takes a while to recognise Wotan,  as does Erda; but sharp-eyed Alberich penetrates the disguise immediately.  Logically that should make Mime and Erda (an earth goddess and former lover  of Wotan) Jewish, and Alberich Aryan; but Weiner won't apply his  &quot;rule&quot; when it doesn't suit him.<br />Moving to  &quot;Meistersinger&quot;, Weiner's now forgotten the rule completely,  because in Act II Eva disguises herself as her maid Magdalena. Walther, a  hero, is fooled until she gets close; Beckmesser is likewise fooled. So is  Eva's father Pogner. Sharp-eyed David sees through the disguise  immediately. So are they all Jews except David? No, because Weiner's rules  apply only when he wants them to. He concludes that only Beckmesser is  Jewish.  (Beckmesser is the Marker, one of the most respected positions in  the Mastersingers, not an outsider from a ghetto. He is the Town Clerk of  16th Century Nuremberg, which is not a town that appointed Jewish Town  Clerks. And he is the favoured suitor to win the hand of a rich Christian  merchant's daughter, before Walther comes along, without race or religion  being an issue. Beckmesser, respected citizen and eligible bachelor -if a  little old - is not a Jewish caricature or character, on perfectly clear  and unambiguous factual grounds.)<br />But Weiner's not interested in facts.  Two more examples. Jewish characters, says Weiner, sing high. So does that  make the heroes Walther, Siegfried and half the Valkyries Jewish? No: only  Mime, and, oddly, the baritones Beckmesser and Alberich, who aren't higher  than Wotan. And he &quot;forgets&quot; to mention Hagen, Klingsor and  Kundry, because though he wants to claim them as Jewish, they sing low.  Another Weiner &quot;rule&quot;? Jews sing coloratura, while Aryans sing  straight. The rule &quot;proves&quot; Beckmesser is Jewish: he sings  coloratura. But so does Brunnhilde in &quot;Siegfried&quot;, so is she  Jewish too? No, Weiner doesn't apply the &quot;rule&quot; then. And so on.<br />He also claims, falsely, that these incoherent &quot;rules&quot; of  Weiner's were understood in Wagner's day. Since they aren't rules at all,  they weren't, of course. He brings forward no evidence to support this  claim. And yet there are ample records of contemporary reviews of Wagner's  operas, which show that, contrary to Weiner's claim, it never occured to  Wagner's contemporaries that his operas contain secret antisemitic  messages. I suspect Weiner knows that, because he must have looked through  when trying to find something he could quote to support his case; and the  silence there is eloquent.<br />In short this is a silly book, intellectually  startling, but not in a good way. It's interesting in the way very bad  films are interesting, and a must for bad-argument fans, but it's  profoundly dishonest and unreliable as a guide to Wagner.<br />This is not  to say that Wagner was not antisemitic; of course he was (Jacob Katz's  &quot;Wagner: The Dark Side of Genius&quot; is a far better book that  exposes and condemns Wagner's antisemitism). It is only to say that Wagner  had the artistic judgement to keep his cranky and bigoted side out of works  that he wanted to have some claim to universality.
