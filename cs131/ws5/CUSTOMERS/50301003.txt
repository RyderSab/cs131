Tupac has touched on many subjects that cross the racial barriers in his book.  He seems a young man full of hope and promise.  The gangster  mentality is almost nonexistent in The Rose That Grew From Concrete.  His  thoughts on love and relationships are wonderul and moving. Even his poem  about death is insightful. Some of the poetry really touched my soul.   I  have been a Tupac fan for many years and when I saw the book in the store,  I immediately started reading.  The poems are compelling and remind  me of  his life. I couldn't wait to share The Rose That Grew From Concrete with my  family and friends.  If you love poetry and the African American culture  than this is a book to add to your collection.	2000-06-01

It provides all kinds of insights into black skin and hair care. The illustrations and pictures are great. I have always had questions about my skin and how to care for it.

I was completely enthralled by the characters in the story.   Olivia is a wonderful blue-stocking scholoar.  Anthony is a dashing, sexy pirate who is a loyal  supporter of the king.  Olivia's dad, Cato, is responsible for keeping the  king from leaving the country.  The novels takes all kinds of twists and is  very entertaining.   Olivia's friends Phoebe and Portia are entertaining  characters.  The friendship between the three sets the tone for the story.    The ending of the story leaves a lot to be desired.  I feel like the  author left the reading hanging.	2000-06-01

The photos really bring to life the various floor coverings and countertops.   Anyone who has  ever designed or planned a kitchen will tell you that its almost impossible  to get a good idea of what a countertop will look like from a small swatch.   The pictures of the different kitchens and styles put the designs into  perspective. The book also has great ideas for cabinets and appliances.	2000-05-31

I couldn't put it down.  I liked the second chance at marriage and love plot.  Jenna wants to remarry and finds out she is still married to the very handsome Mack.  Of course, he won't  sign the divorce papers without fighting for a chance to prove he's  changed. It's a great love story.	2000-05-31

The book begins slowly and crawls along at a snails pace. Charlotte, is full of self-doubt and is entirely self-centered.  Daniel tries to be noble which  is unlike most of the male characters in the Harlequin Presents series.   The two characters don't interact enough in the story for it to be a  plausible romance.  Ms. Jordan spends to much time focusing on Charlotte's  self-doubts instead of on the relationship between the two characters.	2000-05-30

Due to a grouchy grandmother, Beth and Luke are separated for sixteen years.    After sixteen years, Beth receives a phone call about her father's deathbed  wish and rushes home with her fifteen year old son, Ryan.  After a few  weeks, Luke and Beth reaffirm their love.  The story drags in places and  never really achieves the momentum it needs to be a great story.  Most of  the plot is predictable and the characters do not have a lot of depth.   After sixteen years apart, they should have shown more emotion. The story  is not very realistic and loses the reader at times.	2000-05-26

I was expecting a great story and interesting plot.  The characters are mundane and staid.  I was very disappointed in the entire story.  After reading the  first couple of chapters I kept expecting the suspense to build and it  never did.  The blackmail in the story never amounted to much and the only  really interesting character was Lady Danbury.  How to Marry A Marquis is a  disappointment.  This is only the second Julia Quinn story I have read and  I have serious doubts about whether I will read another. The Duke and I was  a much better book.	2000-05-26

Ranulf de Warbrooke is an arrogant character who is mean and thoughtless.  Lyonene is also a thoughtless character who runs in circles in the story.  She is not  a belivable character. The supporting characters in the story are more  cunning and witty then the two leading characters.  I love Jude Deveraux  books.  The setting and atmosphere is perfect in The Black Lyon but the  lead characters are lacking.	2000-05-23

Julie Garwood keeps you turning the pages so you won't miss out on the action.  Gillian shows lots of courage and is a heroine who is witty and strong.  She recognizes the short comings in herself and keeps her promises.  Gillian is faced with many perils  including meeting her hero, Broderick.  He may not be the best leading  character Garwood has created but he is certainly interesting.  I love  stories set in the Highlands and Garwood does a wonderful job of telling  this story.  It reads more like a mystery than a romance, however the story  keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next plot twist. If you  like historical romances than this is the book for you.	2000-04-25
