Superior in design and featuring state of the art controls, it was constructed to hold the worst of the worst from across the nation. It wasn't supposed to allow an escape or for an inmate to be able to lead a rebellion and take over the prison. That is until now.<br /><br />Timothy Driver has instigated a rebellion and as their leader, has over 100 guards and workers hostage. He intendeds to kill a hostage every six hours until Frank Corso comes to him. The same Frank Corso who profiled the former submarine commander in a best selling book after his sensational murder trial. Corso thinks all Driver wants is for Corso to tell Driver's story again in exchange for the freedom of the hostages.<br /><br />Driver has other plans as he walks the slippery slope of sanity. He also has accomplices and despite his apparent growing break with reality, manages not only to escape the facility with Corso as his newest hostage, but to leave mayhem and death in his wake while constantly eluding law enforcement.<br /><br />While G. M. Ford portrays law enforcement as bumbling idiots from time to time, especially in the federal ranks, that tone is not directed at them in this novel.  While Frank Corso in his recurring role as the difficult reporter/author does make a few comments, most of his scorched speech and thought is aimed at the national media and their attempts to sensationalize a story no matter what it is. In this case, it works in the form of the character Melanie Harris, who rode her own emotional trudge of the death of her young child into celebrity pundit expertise and eventually became host of a reality based television show dedicated to hunting down criminals and putting them back behind bars. The allusion to a certain long running televion show on FOX stations around the country are many and at times the thin veneer of fiction is almost non-existent.<br /><br />Series fans that hoped for a quick return of Meg will surely be disappointed. She remains gone and without contact, which may exacerbate Corso's legendary by now \\"death wish.\\"  Or not as the novel is certainly open to reader interpretation on that matter.

Concerned, Ira goes off and finds his friend near death from a shotgun blast to the stomach.  He survives just long enough to get to the hospital and tell Ira to find J. D.<br /><br />J. D. was John Davis who had ridden in the rodeo circuit years before along with Ira and a few other good friends.  Ira had eventually cut back to just taking pictures at the rodeos and occasionally doing clown performances as his regular job became teaching English at the rural campus of Hill County College. Around the same time, J. D. had crashed his truck into a lake in western Oklahoma and though his body was never found, was presumed dead.  His family, a wife and two boys, had moved back to live with her family on a reservation in New Mexico.<br /><br />With Jake dying plea in his ears to find J. D. and an address in New Mexico in hand, Ira begins to hunt for J. D. The trail will cross into New Mexico before returning to the rodeo circuit in Central Texas.  Along the way the 34-year-old Ira will have to deal with the fact that others with dark intent are looking for J. D., that clowning at the rodeos isn't as easy as it used to be, and that the sport he loves is changing and not necessarily for the better.  All that and the fact that romance can be more difficult than any bull in the ring.<br /><br />George Wilhite uses his thirteen years of bare back riding, eight years of bull riding, and numerous other years experience in and around rodeos, to create an enjoyable and heavily atmospheric read.  By the time he is through, the world of the rodeo comes alive for the reader in every sense.  Along the way he also delivers a good mystery, a few twists and turns, some romance, and characters to care about.  The result is a good read, guaranteed to entertain, and a great introduction to a sport that one does not hear nearly enough about.  This is good stuff and well worth the read.<br /><br />Kevin R.

He drives a beautiful car and appears in town with a beautiful woman named Della.  It isn't the first time he has been in town as he was here before in 1942.  This time he is back to seek some revenge and no one remembers him or suspects that he is anything other than what he appears to be-a flamboyant gambler.<br /><br />Revenge for what isn't clear nor is his plan.  His plan does involve a weekly high stakes card game that has been going on for decades at the Weilbach Hotel.  It also isn't really clear which of several players is his target.  It also isn't clear on how Della's interest in a recent oil strike is going to help or for that matter hurt his plan. Like his cards, he keeps his plans close to the vest and adjusts for changes. He does have a plan, he is flexible and he just needs a little help from friends like Chicken Little and Icepick Willie.<br /><br />What follows in this novel by Tyler, Texas resident Milton T. Burton is an intriguing and deeply twisted tale of a great con.  The author opens a portal back into a different time and pulls the reader deeply into a Texas of the recent past.  Told through first person point of view he spins a rich and complex weave that pulls the reader deep into his world where only slowly does the shape and scope of the plan come tantalizingly clear like the mirage on a West Texas highway during the heat of the summer before disappearing again. Heavily atmospheric both in place and in style of writing, this is the kind of novel that starts slowly, moves slowly and pulls the reader in so deep that when one looks up from the book there is that splendid moment of disorientation between the past that might have been and the present.<br /><br />Kevin R.

It was supposed to be simple enough as their last summer vacation before school starts winds down.  She was leaving in the morning with the kids and returning home to New York as she wanted to leave the house stocked with food for her mom, Sarah.  She never returns.<br /><br />For Will, her husband, his carefully constructed life begins to unravel the moment his mother-in-law calls him late at night.  Will knows what the death of a parent can do to a child having lost both of his when he was four due to a car crash.  He also knows that Emily would not have just vanished.  Before long he is on the road speeding south, to Cape Cod and his mother-in-law's home seeking answers.<br /><br />It should have been the local police who found Emily's abandoned care in the parking lot of the grocery store full of groceries.  Instead, it was her husband, Will and a retired FBI profiler, Dr. John Gary, who is writing a book on serial killer's by researching cold cases. The fact that Emily is missing reminds him of an earlier case he recently read and before long he finds others. His research has led him to an inescapable conclusion.  They have five days to find Emily before there is another victim taken from the family.  It will be a son.<br /><br />Shifting in POV, this novel weaves a tale that is guaranteed to stress any parent.  Full of interesting characters and constant misdirection by the author, Kate Pepper, readers are kept guessing as to the identity of the kidnapper/serial killer as the days click by.  The result is tension filled read for the entire 304 page paperback novel that leads to a violent showdown between forces of the good and evil.<br /><br />Kevin R. Tipple (c) 2005	2005-09-06

Evangeline LeClair and reporter Freddie Simpson are once more pulled into a complex mystery as a result of Freddie's first instance of seeing a fresh drowning victim. Sent to cover the story by his paper, the Gazette, Freddie is keenly on alert and taking detailed notes, as is his habit. Something that annoys Evangeline quite a bit but a habit that is necessary and invaluable to their later efforts.<br /><br />Her name was Nora Johnson and she was a secretary at the Hyperion Electroplate Company in Chicago. The police believe she fell or was pushed through the wooden guardrail on factory grounds and landed in the river where she drowned. During the course of interviewing various bystanders Freddie comes across Sophie Simmons. Sophie was summoned by the police to view the body and make positive identification and is justifiably upset. Freddie is able to piece together from her various statements that she was a roommate of Nora's at a local boarding house, was her close friend, and knew that Nora had a secret admirer who gave her various gifts. He also notices a man who appears to be a vagrant working the crowd around the scene with considerably more interest than a mere bystander.<br /><br />After turning in this story for the newspaper, he goes to see his friend Evangeline LeClair who is staying currently at her country house in the suburbs instead of her townhouse in the city. He describes for her his recent activities and appeals to her sense of adventure in proposing they launch a murder investigation. His suspect is the vagrant he saw earlier at the scene and Evangeline does not share his enthusiasm for the case or the suspect. She is very concerned about the poor and homeless in Chicago, the worsening economic conditions and the needs of her Mast house project. However, once given an invitation to a small party at the home of factory owner Martin Allworthy scheduled to be held in a few weeks, her attitude shifts enough that she becomes somewhat intrigued by the idea of attending and making a few inquires. The party quickly becomes the catapult that encourages Evangeline and Freddie to work the case and the two unite in their pursuit of justice on a trail that leads them across the city and surrounding areas by way of a cast of suspects.<br /><br />Against a backdrop of labor unrest, economic depression, women's rights and other social issues relevant to the times then and now, this Sherlock Holmes style cozy becomes an atmospheric read of sheer pleasure. Much like Sherlock was often intellectually one step ahead of Watson, Evangeline is often ahead of Freddie. Not that he doesn't have his moments of gloating as he is proven correct much to his own as well as the reader's amusement. Rich in time period detail, the novel moves at a slow pace as the main characters delve deep into the case and the personalities of those involved. The author teases the reader with one suggestive clue at a time in this read that while briefly mentioning past events could easily be read as a stand-alone or the enjoyable sequel that it is.<br /><br />On one hand the novel is a tale of the timeless themes of blackmail and deceit with a heavy dose of greed and stupidity. On the other hand, the work tells a tale of social conscience that should be as relevant today as the time period depicted. The result is an engrossingly detailed read that brings the time period vividly to life in a way few authors are able to do and at the same time provides an excellent mystery tale that leaves the reader thinking long after the book is finished.<br /><br />Kevin R.

Not that he doesn't have plenty of reason to live in the here and now thanks to his young teenage daughter, Gabriella whom he calls lovingly Bella, her friends, and other things of interest. But, he still feels the loss of his wife Marina and their young son and while he mourns their loss he also never will really know what his wife Marina truly felt and thought.<br /><br />He used to write and hasn't in a very long time. He used to work as a detective until after his last case when Bella hid his private investigator license in an attempt to protect him from himself. It has been over a month and he really hasn't done much of anything. That is until a friend of hers, Daniel, asks Terry Orr for his help.<br /><br />Daniel, describing a situation of a friend of a friend deal asks his help in locating a young student by the name of Allie Powell. Allie took classes at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City and hasn't been seen in days. His powerful parents don't seen to know or even care where he is.  The Uncle who lives up on the Upper East Side wasn't much help either to Daniel's friend when she went looking for him. Daniel doesn't like the situation at all and thinks it needs to be made clear to the family of the missing student that Allie has friends.<br /><br />Orr agrees to talk to the Uncle and things quickly get out of hand. Accosted and roughed up repeatedly, Orr works a case that quite clearly no one in the boy's family want him involved with. Beyond the rather strange Uncle and his issues, the parents have an agenda of their own and the welfare of their son seems to be a minor secondary concern. They share their lack of concern over the boy's safety with another group who is looking for him for unknown reasons and don't seem to care who gets hurt in the process.

But any poetry that might have been contained in that moment was lost when I stared into Honoria's face, convinced that human insanity was as close to our fingertips as the act of rubbing fog off a windowpane.<br /><br />Honoria's eyes remained fixed on mine, expectant, somehow trusting, the redness of her mouth and the mole next to it as inviting as a poisonous flower.\\" (Crusader's Cross, Page 66)<br /><br />The inherent evil whether born or created in some and righting past wrongs as best as one can have always been strong themes in the Dave Robicheaux series of novels. That certainly is true in this latest effort, which leads readers back in time to 1958 before returning to the present.<br /><br />Years ago, Dave and his brother Jimmie met a young woman named Ida Durbin in Galveston, Texas. Jimmie quickly fell in love with her not knowing much about her including the fact that she was a prostitute. Once he found out, he made plans to get her away from her pimp and out of the life. Unfortunately, that didn't work and she vanished without a trace moments before Jimmie was supposed to meet her. Jimmie has always carried a torch for her, convinced she survived whatever happened and may have even had a country music career.<br /><br />In the present, Dave is called to the hospital to talk to Troy Bordelon. Troy has been asking for Dave for some reason possible because they knew each other years ago. Troy always was bullying scum and Dave has no idea why he would want to talk to him about anything. Troy tells him that his Uncle was one of the cops who took a woman away (presumably Ida) years ago and he doesn't know if she is dead or not. Dave tries to get more information but Troy is unable to talk. He also gets little information about of two Sheriff's deputies who lurk outside the hospital and want to know what Troy told Dave. The cops are dirty and with the sudden death of Troy during the night, the answers are going to be harder to find.<br /><br />For Dave, he doesn't know if she is alive or dead or what happened so long ago. He also can't explain why if she is alive, she never contacted Jimmie. Dave goes back home to New Iberia, Louisiana but with so many questions about what happened and guilt over the fact that they didn't do more at the time, he isn't about to leave things alone. Before long, he is back on the local police force so that his questions have some authority behind them. Once again, as he investigates he begins dealing with another wealthy family that seems rotten at the core while at the same time dealing with his continuing grief over the death of his wife and his own alcoholic demons. Throw in a serial killer who starts dropping bodies in the area as possible a message to Dave, the usual hard nosed antics of Clete Purcell, the usual media circus and a new love interest for Dave, along with a few other story ingredients, and the result is another dark and brooding crime laden mystery that is good to the final word.<br /><br />As always, author James Lee Burke, turns a phrase well and brings the beauty as well as the pain fully alive for the reader. Told primarily through Dave's viewpoint, the read moves forward slowly in terms of time and the long back story as well as the crimes depicted in the here and now. Through it all, there is a certain melancholy feel to the work as Dave while dealing with everything going on in his life, comments frequently about the passing of years, the aging process, life spans and death, and such. More so that in the earlier novels in the series and this time it is like Dave believes that his life has pretty much passed him by.<br /><br />This reader was left with a sense that this novel, beyond being another good one, could easily be the final novel of the series. One hopes not and hopefully there will be many more. If it is the final one, he ends the series on a high note and in one book, hits on all the story themes that have made up in the entire series.

Jackson Hole, home of the Teton District, is the marquee district in the state of Wyoming and as such, the political playground of the rich and famous as well as any environmental group. While intrigued with the challenge of running such a high profile district, Joe Pickett never wanted to get the job because of the death of his good friend Will Jensen.<br /><br />However, that is exactly what happened and the fact that he apparently died by suicide is unbelievable to Joe. The man he knew never would have done such a thing. As he begins work in the district, he begins to understand some of the intense pressure Will was under first hand. While some questions are quickly answered, those answers as well as an unrelated string of events, lead Joe to dig into the case. Powerful interests are at work and as Joe digs into not only Will's suicide but various matters he was working on, decisions are made that put Joe into peril as well as his family back home in Saddlestring.<br /><br />As in earlier novels in the series, this fifth novel in the series reflects the author's clear love for the outdoors as well as his disdain for various groups that use the environment for their own selected purpose. Environmentalists, politicians, and land developers come up for equal contempt as Joe tries to balance out everyone's needs in regards to the best use of the land. The marital strife between Joe and his wife, which first surfaced a couple of novels ago continues and is made worse by the forced separation. However, overriding it all is the storyline of Will Jensen's death, which remains a strong intriguing presence that runs the gamut of the book and is not lost among the side stories.<br /><br />Which is why, novel after novel, this author remains worth reading. Consistently, C. J. Box shows the average person what the Game Wardens have to face in our modern use it all up today society and how difficult their job is to protect the wilderness that some of us got to see in our youth. At the same time, each novel has at its core, an intriguing mystery that just as easily could have happened at the center of the urban jungle.

The fraud was worth millions and orchestrated by the Romero crime family who made several attempts to have her silenced. Her real name was Hope Stevens and Larson never stopped loving her. Even when she vanished into the Witness Protection System and he, after he recovered from his serious injuries, was transferred to the Marshal's Service Fugitive Apprehension Task Force, he quietly continued his search for her hoping she still felt the same way.<br /><br />Summoned to the home of Leopold Markowitz, the creator of the complex computer code that protects the WITSEC master list, Larson makes a gruesome discovery. Markowitz's personal assistant is dead and has been for some time. Based on the appearance of the body, it is clear that he was killed by the same ruthless contract killer who attacked his small team six years ago killing several of Larson's fellow agents. Markowitz is gone, no doubt in the hands of the Romero crime family who haven't given up on their fanatical blood quest to find and kill Hope Stevens. Now Larson has to find Markowitz and safeguard the encrypted list per his superiors. While that may be their priority, his is the woman he knew as Hope Stevens as well as the five-year-old daughter he never knew he had.<br /><br />Constantly switching in viewpoint from Larson, Hope, her daughter Penny, the contract killer and others, the novel moves forward at a very fast pace towards the inevitable violent confrontation at the Romero family home. As in most thrillers, character development is limited with the focus clearly on the hunt for a killer. This novel is no exception with most of the limited character development being handled through short flashbacks to the chaotic events of six years ago.<br /><br />Those events and the choices he made have fueled the guilt and regret that drive Larson as well as Hope throughout the entire novel. However, despite that underlying storyline, the main focus, as in most thrillers, is the violent action. In that regard, the novel works well as the chase bounces from location to location across the country and creates a fast twisting read which showcases why Ridley Pearson can be counted on to deliver a good book.<br /><br />Kevin R.

Stupidity that most recently caused Dewayne to kill an elderly man in the course of robbing him for a small cash payroll of a few thousand dollars. Stupidity that caused the son's of the deceased man, Raymond and John Lee, to begin their own violent hunt for Dewayne. Both the sons and Keller have a good idea where Dewayne is headed. Keller needs him alive so that he can take care of the bond money because the Old West adage of bring them back dead or alive no longer works.

Media speculation, absent of any facts or evidence, is that Wayne killed his wife and daughter, disposed of the bodies, returned home and was so despondent that he committed suicide. John Weston does not believe any of it and wants Private Investigators Lincoln Perry and Joe Pritchard to get involved. He wants to know what happened and wants them to find Betsy and Julie.<br /><br />John Weston knows the Police are actively working the case but his son knew of Lincoln Perry and had spoken highly of him and his partner. What Lincoln knows of the flamboyant Wayne Weston makes him feel differently about him, but there is no dispute that John Weston is suffering a living death.  There are lots of reasons to stay out but one major reason to get involved and Lincoln finds himself agreeing to what John Weston wants. Before long, Joe Pritchard's concerns about accepting the case pale in comparison to the clear and obvious fact that Wayne Weston made some very powerful enemies, both in public and in not so public areas. Enemies who will tolerate their presence and digging until they actually begin to make progress. Once that happens, the body count begins to steadily climb, as not only are the investigators targets but anyone they come into contact.<br /><br />This novel quickly becomes a gripping read as one is pulled into this complex tale of powerful men, the Russia Mafia, murder, law enforcement corruption and good old basic evil. This is a powerful read, despite the author's relative young twenty-one year old age, as the book works on all levels as if the author were much older. Despite some reviews, which have chastised the author for lack of character development, that simply isn't the case. While the novel is primarily written from the viewpoint of Lincoln Perry, Joe Pritchard is also complex and given plenty of time before readers. Every debut novel has secrets about the main characters which will be fleshed out further later in the series and this novel is no exception.<br /><br />That clear character development enhances a complex storyline with numerous twists and turns that reveal puzzles within puzzles. Just when it becomes clear who the enemies are, the author shakes things up and changes the stakes as well as the perceptions. Then, there is the final twist in the last few pages that hits with the literary effect of a sucker punch in the stomach. There is a reason why this novel won the \\"2003 St. Martin's Press/PWA Prize For Best First P.I. Novel.\\" If it isn't clear already, the book is very good.<br /><br />Kevin R.

She works out of a county bureau office in South Kingston and spends her days covering school board meetings, retyping press release and police reports, and other lightweight but needed articles. She still dreams of the big story but the big story blew up in her face once before and she constantly worries it could happen again.<br /><br />Dreams are what got her into trouble in the first place. Dreams that caused insomnia so severe that she became addicted to sleeping pills. And addiction she still fights and is very careful not to give into again. That battle quickly becomes harder when the owner of The Mazursky Market, Barry Mazursky, is gunned down while she is in the small convenience store. While she did not see the shooter put the bullet into Mazurky's brain, she knows exactly who did it. Moments before a large man in a parka had cursed her when she saw his face and there is no doubt he killed Mazursky.<br /><br />While she cared deeply about Mazursky and felt him to be a friend as she wrote in the paper for a lead story, the facts are that she really knew very little about him. After praising him extensively in print, it slowly becomes clear that Mazursky hid dark secrets. Assigned to continue to work the case by the editorial staff of the paper, she begins to discover pieces of information while asking why the police are stonewalling the case. Links to political corruption and a coming referendum of gambling appear and it seems many of the characters are using Hallie for their own ends. As she investigates, Hallie figures out this wasn't a simple robbery gone wrong, but a public execution designed to send a statement to certain individuals. She realizes this could her chance to break back into the big leagues and claim total redemption for her past sins. That is, if she doesn't miss the warning signs and get herself killed.<br /><br />Rich in detail and with somewhat stock characters, this novel works forward very slowly as Hallie pulls the pieces together. As in many cozy style novels, the pace is slow and the mystery is an ongoing theme but often not primary. Such is the case here, as Hallie deals with possible romantic entanglements with a handsome District Attorney among others, her own addictive personality, relationship issues, both professional and personal, and her ongoing debate with herself over her own past failures and triumphs. Hallie is a complex persona who seems to shift back and forth, waffling between the responsibilities of adulthood and a wishing for simpler things. With the focus so scattered across so many themes, the first two hundred pages of this novel read like an elaborate setup piece.<br /><br />But the final seventy-five to one hundred pages make the wait worth it as the novel begins to go. As the pressures rapidly mount, Hallie spends less wasted time with doubt and self-recriminations and becomes real to the reader as she reacts to the considerable forces allied against her.<br /><br />Those familiar with the background political history at the state and local level in Rhode Island will appreciate this novel more than others. No doubt heavily based on real life people at high levels of State and local government, this cozy encourages speculation as to who the fictional characters are based on. That fact as well as the rich details in setting work well and make this novel come alive for the reader.<br /><br />All in all, this is an enjoyable read that follows her first novel, \\"Final Copy.\\" This novel is not a sequel and easily works well as a stand-alone or as a possible series start. That of course, is up to the author, but I hope that she will bring back Hallie for another adventure soon.<br /><br />Kevin R.

Not only is she battling prescription substance abuse and nightly panic attacks, she is dealing with the rippling aftereffects on her and her parents of her brother's recent death. Recently demoted at the newspaper, her bosses now want her to use her relationship from 14 years ago to gain personal access to a murder suspect.<br /><br />Kit Korbanics, business partner of Francis Marquesson, is suspected of throwing Marquesson over a balcony of the Harbor Inn Hotel to his death. The fact that Addy dated him in college has given her a chance to resurrect her struggling journalism career by doing an in depth profile on Kit. But in reaching out to Kit to do her assigned piece, painful old memories and feelings surface. Against a backdrop of venture capitalism, bioengineering and the beginnings of the synthetic cocaine problem, Addy struggles to investigate Kit and once again practice journalistic objectivity.<br /><br />Featuring a sympathetic main character, this novel slowly moves forward in cozy style and tantalizes the reader with clues and misdirection.  Much like her second novel \\"A Confidential Source\\"  which is a stronger book, Addy deals with the same issues of substance abuse, inability to sleep, and drawing the line between her life as a reporter and her personal life. While the heroines are differently named, readers will recognize the many commonalities between the two.<br /><br />Well written, no doubt due to the author's wide experiences in journalism, this read provides a tantalizing glimpse into the harsh realities of the modern newspaper newsroom. At the same time, it provides a good mystery as well as giving the reader a reason to read bylines in the morning paper just a little differently.<br /><br />Kevin R. Tipple © 2005	2005-08-14

Stone has dropped by to have a drink having eaten dinner elsewhere as had Dino and Elaine wasn't thrilled that they were occupying Stone's usual table on a busy night. Bill Eggers, managing partner of Woodman & Weld arrives bringing Stone a new client. Stone handles the cases and problems that would be best not handled directly by employees of Woodman & Weld, so the fact Bill Eggers has brought in another isn't a surprise as Stone thinks he knows what to expect.  Instead, the new client, who won't say why he needs Stone having asked for him specifically, is a stereotypical Texan from head to toe named Billy Bob Barnstormer. Stone takes an instant dislike to him but can't say no to Bill Eggers who has made it plain Stone is to handle Barnstormer.<br /><br />Stone also can't say no when Dino helpfully suggests that Stone put up Barnstormer in his house for a few days. Eggers thinks it is a grate idea so with that decided Stone and Barnstormer head out into the cold night to go to Stone's home.  Things quickly take a strange turn minutes later when someone opens fire shooting at Barnstormer and only hitting the window of his limousine. Barnstormer is ready to fire back, whipping out an old fashioned Colt Single Action Army six-shooter which Stone quickly takes away from him citing New York's well known gun laws. Those shots and Stone's subsequent confiscation of Barnstormer's gun mark the beginning of a client-attorney relationship that gets stranger and stranger with Stone in more and more trouble as the pages go by.<br /><br />This novel is typical Stone Barrington and as such, poses little surprise for the reader. Slightly more complex than most in this long running series, it features the studly Stone Barrington as his graphic bedroom best. Between the attentions of a beautiful Untied Sates Attorney and his old flame Arrington, Stone has his hands full with the ladies in his life. Unfortunately, he isn't quite so adept in dealing with Billy Bob Barnstormer, a dead hooker found in his home that results in a murder investigation, and secrets from his past.<br /><br />If you have read recent books in the series than you know exactly what you are getting. If you haven't, this novel is a cut above recent efforts on the series except for a final twist that many readers no doubt surmised books ago. Despite that anticlimactic moment, the novel is pretty good and will serve readers well on their favorite beach as the summer winds down.<br /><br />Kevin R.

In this fifth novel of the series, Tony Valentine is still dealing with the temptation of Lucy Price, his own son Gerry and his mistakes, as well as catching cons and cheaters through his company, GriftSense. It is because of his company and the fact that Tony is the best that his old friend, Bill Higgins, director of the Nevada Gaming Control Board flies out to Florida to make a personal pitch for help. Higgins knows a recent winner, Ricky Smith, had to have cheated but he doesn't know how and the fact that Ricky is a media sensation doesn't help matters.<br /><br />After escaping a burning hotel by jumping several stories into a swimming pool, Ricky Smith, named Mr. Lucky by the media, walked across the street and into the Mint.  Once inside the casino he couldn't stop winning. He took the casino for more than 200 thousand at Blackjack, 250 thousand at Roulette, and another 300 thousand at craps. He then moved on to playing poker with the legendary Tex \\"All In\\" Snyder and whipped him for a nice chunk of change. Higgins knows Mr. Lucy had to have cheated, somehow, and wants Tony to prove it.<br /><br />They make a deal and soon Tony and his son, Gerry, are working the case from opposite angles. Tony heads for the hometown of Slippery Rock, North Carolina where Ricky is from while Gerry is supposed to go to Gulfport, Mississippi and see Tex Snyder. Before long, each has dug up far more than they bargained for. Throw in the Dixie Mafia, violent small town crooks, and some rather annoyed cops, and this read becomes another roller coaster ride in the series and another treat from James Swain.<br /><br />Just like the series as a whole, this novel is an up and down ride where suspects are many as are the motivations and misdirection is common. Character development is limited and consists mainly of Gerry's ongoing battle to resist the demons within and turn his life around thanks to the heavy influence of his wife Yolanda and new baby. He is desperately trying to redeem himself and be the kind of man his father is and that his family needs while at the same time resisting the ever present lure of easy cash in the form of one scheme or another. His eternal struggle and guilt over it mirrors Tony's own struggle with guilt over the role he played in Lucy's recent lapse in judgment and resulting arrest.<br /><br />As always, those themes are secondary to the main mystery storyline and detailed explanations of various cheating scams. Like other novels in this series, the author's book is a primer on how to spot cheating on both sides of the table and is often laugh out loud funny as various scenarios are explained.<br /><br />Then there is the fact that this read is simply just plain old good fun. Danger exists but unlike real life, one knows with a shadow of a doubt it all will turn out right in the end. Sometimes it just doesn't get better than that.<br /><br />Kevin R.

He was like a father to Diddio and in a way, was to Orr as well. While both Diddio and Orr knew Leo was not the picture of good health, far from it actually, his death is a shock and a heavy blow and another in the tragic series that has befallen the small group of friends. Also shocking were his last requests that they find hidden in his things.<br /><br />Diddio is to get Tilt and is to make of it what he will. Orr is to keep an eye on Diddio which is something he would have done anyway and isn't a surprise. What is surprising is that Leo wants Orr to find Loretta Jones, Leo's evil ex-wife and make her pay for what she did to Leo years ago. He wants justice from the grave and Orr isn't going to turn this request down.  He begins with good intentions but soon is sidetracked by an opportunity to catch the madman he hold responsible for killing his wife and young son.<br /><br />Emotionally complex, this novel somewhat completes a story arc that was begun in the first novel. Obsession has been a strong theme throughout the previous two books but not nearly at the level in this book. Obsession and the past along with Orr's raw emotions are ramped up to a higher level that in the previous books but yet do not rise to the level that would drown the reader.<br /><br />While there are heavy periods of intense emotional angst and introspection, the main storyline of bringing Loretta Jones to justice is always present. Often that storyline is slowed to a near standstill while Orr searches for his own personal justice but his search and Leo's last request are deeply intertwined. This sets up a final fifty pages or so when everything clicks into place and the reader is whipped along in an intense climax. Considering the overall story arcs, it isn't surprising that this novel is aimed squarely at the ongoing internal emotions and psychic struggle of Orr. As such, it also becomes a character study of one man and where his responsibility and well as guilt lie.<br /><br />This third book in the series is another excellent book. I strongly recommend reading the two previous books so that the power of this book is not diminished. It is simply very good stuff and a real treat.<br /><br />Kevin R.

He still misses his wife and young son and he still isn't writing. He is still doing some private investigator work in the hopes of learning the skills necessary to take down the madman responsible for the pain he and Bella feel.<br /><br />When his housekeeper asks him to talk to a friend of hers in need, the least he can do is talk to her. The friend's name is Dorotea Salgado and she wants her daughter Sonia Salgado found. One wouldn't think it would be too hard to find her since Sonia only recently got out of prison after serving a thirty-year prison sentence for the murder of a diamond merchant in the course of a robbery. The murder was particularly brutal and Terry wonders from the beginning how a physically small high school student could have done it. He wonders that and a lot more when he finds Sonia dead days later. The case quickly becomes something he can't give up and before long this obsession, like his others, puts him crosswise with everyone around him.<br /><br />This second novel of the series does not suffer the usual fatal flaws most second novels do. The writing remains top notch as the author continues to expand Orr's world and further nuance the cast of recurring characters. Bella continues to appear smarter than her years to the reader and yet, at other times, there is an endearing child like quality to her known by many parents of the young teenager set. Also realistic is Terry's continuing pain over the loss of his wife and young child as well as his first real tentative steps in returning to the world around him instead of just living day to day. Overriding everything is another complicated and well done mystery where almost everyone has a hidden agenda quite possible worth killing for.<br /><br />Kevin R. Tipple © 2005	2005-08-04

Thanks to changes in command leadership at the LAPD and intense lobbying by his former partner, Kizman Rider, his three year forced retirement is over. Bosch returns to work out of the fifth floor of Parker Center (Police Headquarters) in the Open-Unsolved Unit. With a warning to do things the correct way from the new Chief of Police ringing in his ears, Bosch gets his first case seventeen years in the making.<br /><br />Back in 1988, a sixteen-year-old girl disappeared from her home. Mislabeled as a runaway, the case was mishandled from the beginning. Two days later, her body was found nearby in a wooded area at the base of an Oak tree. Dead by way of a bullet from the .45 caliber Colt semiautomatic handgun found at her feet, investigators mistakenly believed it was a suicide. It wasn't until days later and the autopsy results came it that the case was finally classified as a homicide but possible critical evidence in her home as well as the death scene was never recovered. That fact along with numerous other problems doomed the case to failure.<br /><br />That is until the unit is alerted that some DNA evidence taken at the time off the murder weapon matches to a possible suspect. Despite internal political pressures and a determined effort by some within the Department to impede the investigation, Bosch has a mission and isn't about to stop regardless of the personal consequences. His mission is to not only find the killer or killers but to bring some answers to grieving parents who have suffered the pain of not knowing who or why for far too long.<br /><br />While a strong and well written mystery, this latest Harry Bosch does not have the same emotional edge of the early ones such as \\"The Black Echo\\" and \\"The Black Ice.\\"  Harry has continued to mellow some since his forced retirement and that mellowing is very apparent in this novel. While he is still driven to provide answers for the survivors and some sort of justice for the dead victims, the episodes of his red rage as well as his instances of walking the tightrope of personal control have steadily diminished over the last several books. Even when confronted with vents that would have triggered a more emotional reaction in the past, Bosch is able to hold things together well and react accordingly. The older and emotionally wiser Harry Bosch walks to the edge and looks over but does not willingly dive deep into the pool of rage.<br /><br />Not to say this isn't a good book. On so many levels it is as Bosch and Rider work a case where Department politics, race relations, and time have played huge factors. The novel continues a strong and very enjoyable series. It is only when measured against the earl Bosch novels that this most recent installment does not measure up.

I was recently sent the forth book in this series, \\"Hard, Hard City\\" by Jim Fusilli for an upcoming review at another site. Having read and enjoyed \\"Hard, Hard City\\" so much, it seemed an excellent idea to look for the rest of the series. For once, my local library had them all.<br /><br />The series opens with \\"Closing Time\\" and it is in this book we meet many of the principal characters. Terry Orr is mourning the violent passing of his wife Marina and their baby boy as well as dealing with thoughts of vengeance and retaliation against the man he believes is responsible. Since the police have been unable to help, Terry has put his successful writing career on the backburner and is aggressively learning how to be a private investigator. He believes by doing so he can achieve his goal of apprehending the man responsible for the virtual destruction of his family. Some would say he also put on the backburner his beautiful 12-year-old daughter, Gabriella (affectionately nicknamed \\"Bella\\"), but he would strongly disagree.<br /><br />He would argue that he is dealing with things as best as he can. That is all he can do, day-to-day, as he adjusts but he sees Marina and the baby symbolically in everything around him. He certainly does when he sees Judith Henley Harper and their chance meeting on a New York City street is another dig into his soul. Harper used to be his wife's agent as Marina painted beautiful pictures that sold and sold very well. Thanks to her paintings and Terry's own book sales, money still isn't an issue in their home. The last thing he wants to do is to go to the old art gallery as he will be forced to confront memories of happier times and the sadness of today. But that is exactly what Harper wants Terry and Bella to do, as there will be a showing of a new artist in a few days. Bella who has been after her father to write again, to get out and live again, thinks it is a wonderful idea. Before long, commitments are made and they go to the showing.<br /><br />Which almost proves fatal as a bomb explodes during the show seriously injuring Harper who is saved only by Terry's quick thinking in the aftermath. Harper unknowingly becomes a client for Terry as he launches a personal investigation into who did it and why. He also takes on another client, this time in the form of an elderly dead man, when he launches an investigation into the murder of Cabdriver Aubrey Brown. Like the Harper case, it became personal for entirely different reasons after finding the man dead in his livery cab. As he works two very divergent and difficult cases, he begins to see commonalities in both as well as links to himself while dealing with the challenges of moving on and being a good father.<br /><br />This first novel lays an extensive foundation of the series with the introduction of so many of the continuing secondary characters. Told exclusively through Terry's viewpoint, the reader sees his world as he sees it and through judicious use of dialogue how others see him. Unlike so many novels today that shift through various points of view, a reader of this novel is immersed deeply into Terry's world and never once jarred out of it over the course of the 275-page book.<br /><br />While the psychological component of the past and those issues as well as his resulting emotions are a major theme of the work, the author does not let that interfere with the twin case storylines. Instead, the thematic elements are balanced with the cases and current day life issues in such away to not only further round out the characters but to move the story forward. Not an easy task but one the author does seamlessly in page after page.<br /><br />After you have had your fill of the summer beach books, take a look at this one for some mystery meat. I can guarantee you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Kevin R. Tipple © 2005<br /> <br />Kevin R. Tipple  2005 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-31

Summoned to accompany FBI Agent Jennifer Margold, he is his usual anti-authority mouthy self when taken to a crime scene in suburban Washington. Six people are dead including the White House Chief of Staff. If that wasn't bad enough, a message was left behind threatening to kill the President within 48 hours.<br /><br />Not only did they promise to kill the President, the assassination team plans to collect on an Internet website bounty offer of $100 million for the deed. Whoever ran the site, which was up for a matter of days before it vanished, is long gone and untraceable. Those that knew of the site and Sean Drummond did not, believed the site and the offer a hoax. Based on the carnage at the crime scene, which includes the assigned protective detail of four FBI agents, others took it seriously and fully intend to collect.<br /><br />As always happens when the problem is big and about to become very pubic in the media, an interagency task force is created to spread blame and accountability. Sean Drummond, a natural loner with an ability to figure out baffling cases, is assigned to work with Agent Margold. Like the entire task force, the two seem constantly behind and getting nowhere as the assassination team strikes again and again raising the body count and causing panic in the media and in the government.<br /><br />This is an intense novel that constantly encourages the reader to turn the page as Sean Drummond and others chase clues and suspects across the country and back to Washington. While little new is added to the Sean Drummond character, most of the other characters seem cut from the typical thriller stereotypes. Agent Margold with her expertise in profiling comes from a troubled background. George Meany, who happens to be Margold's boss, is still the vain, petty little man and typical of all such bureaucrats everywhere. Numerous other examples exist in the novel and will become obvious to readers.

No murders and Homicide Detectives Leo Magozzi and Gino Rolseth are bored out of their minds. They can hardly stand it, as people just aren't killing each other. Then the calls start coming in on one beautiful April morning and they aren't bored any longer.<br /><br />Leo and Gino get assigned a case of an elderly man who died at the Uptown Nursery of a gunshot wound to the head. The deceased man was Morey Gilbert who seemed to have been loved by everyone in the neighborhood. Often such an idea is media hyperbole, but the fact that hundreds of people are crying on the sidewalks outside his nursery, the pressure that is rolling downhill in the chain of command, etc., proves that in this case, it is true. It was his daughter Hannah that was one of the victims in the Monkewrench case. A death that nearly destroyed their former colleague, Marty Pullman. Morey's death may serve as the catalyst to pull Marty back from the abyss he was hurtling towards in a desperate attempt to end his suffering. Not only does he have to deal with the death of his father-in-law, Morey's strong willed wife, Lily and their son, Jack, need him whether or not either will admit it to help heal their horribly fractured relationship.<br /><br />Soon Marty adds bodyguard to his list of duties as other elderly citizens from the neighborhood are found dead in various ways. As Leo and Gino along with several other detectives work their respective cases and chase a tenuous lead that might link their victims, Marty is left to try and find out what Jack knows. That and to keep Jack alive long enough that he might tell before a killer finishes the job.<br /><br />While the first novel of this series from this mother/daughter writing team was fast paced and captivating, this sequel was not. Grace McBride and her team, the focal point of the first novel, were virtually shoved off the pages in favor of the Homicide Unit. They get very little mention other than a small secondary storyline, which no doubt sets up the current novel just released, \\"Dead Run.\\"<br /><br />Instead, the focus is on Leo and Gino and the result becomes a slow moving often boring read. Setting aside the obvious expectation that Grace and team would be the primary focus in the sequel, this novel does not work as written. The Homicide Unit characters portray all the usual stereotypes one would expect from a movie of the week or the latest installment of yet another crime scene investigation series. Without giving away the link between them, it is one of the most clich&eacute;d ones used in the last couple of decades and weak at best as used here. Other authors, primarily in the thriller genre, have used the same idea with far better results. While the primary storyline does provide a few surprises at the end, the effort getting there in monumental as the read is often incredibly boring. As such, the work never really comes alive for the reader and becomes a long detour from what is hoped to be the primary series.<br /><br />A weak sequel is a notorious and very common problem in a series-especially a series that started out so successfully. While reading this novel, one constantly hopes for the appearance of Grace and her team to bring some life into the work. The appearances are shockingly few but when they do appear, it is appreciated. One hopes that this mother/daughter team got this sort of thing out of their system and will in the future keep the focus on Grace and the team, which made these authors worth reading in the first place.<br /><br />Kevin R.

The Hardnosed P. I. alone in his office when the beautiful dame (great legs, of course) walks in. Smoke wreathes the ceiling as she folds her long legs under the chair and tells our hero her problem. He can help her he decides and beyond that, there is something she makes him feel that he hasn't felt for a very long time. In this anthology, the clich&eacute; is stood on its head and spun around for interesting results.<br /><br />This anthology, the third f the Fedora series, features seventeen hard-hitting stories of men being hardnosed men, dealing with the evil that walks the mean streets. While it is impossible to cover each story in detail, the selections below reflect a small sampling of the range of stories.<br /><br />\\"Ordained Sin\\" by Carol Kilgore features Nolan Douglas who just ticked off his girlfriend-again. But, a case that falls into his lap just might help him ease back into her good graces as well as allowing him to clean up some human scum. Sometimes the innocents truly do suffer and nothing and no one can save them.<br /><br />\\"One Hit Wonder\\" By J. L. Abramo is an intriguing story of a misdialed phone call.  When placing your phone order for a hit, make sure you call the right number and not Jake Diamond of Diamond Investigations.<br /><br />No anthology would be complete without at least one story about bail bonds and bond jumpers. In this case, read \\"Kane's Mutiny\\" by Bev Vincent. Not only is Jimmy Weber on the run with Kane looking for him, Weber's wife wants to help Kane any way she can.<br /><br />Featuring stories from other excellent writers such as Tom Sweeney, Lee Goldberg, George Wilhite, David Terrenoire, David Bart, James S. Dorr, Chelle Martin, Dorothy Rellas, Ann Aptaker, Nick Andreychuk, Michael Hemmingson, Graham Powell, Kevin Egan and Editor Michael Bracken, interested readers won't find a bad story in the bunch.

Lonny is bored, unhappy and seriously depressed while he daydreams of finding the perfect stone and proving his father wrong in so many ways. Through bribery and contacts as well as an affinity for languages he has managed to sort of exist in the daily life of Madagascar but still there are limits and he truly does not fit in here anymore than he does back home. Everything changes when he comes across a perfect and rather large sapphire stone one Easter Sunday.<br /><br />The sale is made with the peasant that found it and Lonny now has a problem bigger than the stone itself. How to get it home despite obstacles of claimed ownership by others, corrupt politicians and military police, and the general lawless anarchy that is the culture and way of life on the island. Not only is an incredible amount of money at stake and vindication of himself, his very life is at stake as he begins his perilous journey home with little help or support.<br /><br />While billed on the jacket copy as a thriller, this novel is actually more of a slow moving atmospheric detailed read of the culture and people of the country. Long and extremely detailed sections are devoted to the history, religions, and politics of Madagascar, past and present. Other long and very detailed sections are devoted to the economic conditions, the climate, American foreign policy, its place in the world and the harsh strain of everyday life. The author extensively traveled and worked in the area and what he has created here is a slow moving story that uses those experiences in depth to provide a valuable insight into the region while at the same time offering an adventure.<br /><br />The center of that adventure is Lonny Cushman. It is no coincidence that the story begins early on Easter Sunday. Throughout the 260-page novel, the adventure provides the theme of the work in telling of his, for all intents and purposes, living death and his ultimate resurrection. Lonny does it all not just to prove something, not just for his father and his ex-wife, but for his seven-year-old daughter who hasn't seen him in a very long time. In so doing, Lonny undergoes a transformation as he crosses the countryside of Madagascar of the soul and character.<br /><br />Richly and deeply detailed in place and setting, the author uses his vast experience in the area to bring home a deeply detailed picture of the island nation of Madagascar for the reader in a way no guidebook could possibly achieve. The resulting novel is more of a history or cultural world and less a thriller, but still an interesting read.<br /><br />This entire review previously appeared online at the Mystery Morgue.<br /><br />Kevin R.

Against the background of their budding intimate relationship, Eidson weaves a tail of deception and greed that will wreak havoc on the guilty and the innocent alike.<br /><br />No one really believes Matt Coulter's story and even Matt isn't sure it actually happened the way he remembers things. While the news reports of their ship going down, demasted in a fierce storm and the loss of his family believed drowned at sea tell one chain of events, he tells another. Matt, who has suffered a severe head injury and resulting memory loss as well as other physical traumas, tells a tale of another boat arriving on scene and believes that his son and daughter were taken away on that boat while he and his wife were left to die in the storm tossed sea. His wife's body was found a short time after he was rescued by Coast Guard Helicopter, but the kids were never found despite an extensive search. Matt is on a desperate search for help and for someone to believe his story.<br /><br />Jack Merchant does and agrees to help with his first efforts aimed at trying to find the mystery boat based on a fragmentary description Matt remembers. His memory of a unique bow plate seems to be real and before long Merchant and Ballard are chasing leads and digging up secrets that others do not want found. The trail will lead to a violent confrontation at sea that will put their relationship to a horrendous test should they survive.<br /><br />Continuing to build on the rich characters of Merchant and Ballard, Eidson has brought them to life once again in this engrossing story. Unfortunately, that can't be said for the villains of the work.  While all the motivations are not clear until the end of the novel, too often, the villains seem to be stereotypes. Edison does make a laudable effort to build depth to them and make them real, but they are all still weak from start to finish.<br /><br />However, the weakness of the villains is a minor quibble considering the overall strength of the story. This is a fast paced complex read that provides, despite the character development issues noted above, and incredibly satisfying intense read all the way to the end.

While some apparently see food as an aphrodisiac, for the authors of this anthology, food becomes either a weapon directly or as a reason for murder. Food, which includes a recipe or two with every story, much like the \\"Martha's Vineyard\\" mystery series by Philip R. Craig, is an integral part of each scenario. Some stories are more hands on with food than others, but each story would collapse without the vital food element.<br /><br />For Nancy Pickard in her story, \\"Truth Serum\\" A Marie Lightfoot Story\\" food involves a coffee shop in Spokane, Washington. Marie Lightfoot begins to investigate the deaths at Qahveh Khaneh and soon finds the suspect right under her nose.<br /><br />In \\"When Henry Met Salad\\" by Tamar Myers, it isn't just all about the food that makes this story both intriguing as well as funny. One can try but one can't fake being truly Amish.<br /><br />Then there is the dark twisted story, \\"Best Served Chilled\\" by Robert Perry. I'm not going to even try to explain this one full of twists and turns that will leave you guessing until the end. You just have to read it.<br /><br />While those three were my personal favorites, the rest of the book is equally good. It features stories by Joanne Pence, Tim Hemlin, Denise Dietz, Camilla T. Crespi, Kris Neri, Jeffrey Marks, Amy Myers, William Allen Peck, Toni L. P. Kelner, Anne Perry and Janet Laurence. Not a bad one in the bunch. Each one serves as a tasty read and guaranteed, no matter your level of cooking skills, you won't look at food as quite so innocent again.<br /><br />This complete review previously appeared online at Mysterical-E.<br /><br />Kevin R.

Gradually coming out of his self-imposed exile deep in the Florida Everglades, he is currently staying at a small bungalow his friend, lawyer, and now quite often his employer, owns. By staying there he is more readily accessible to Billy who has him close by for another project.<br /><br />That close proximity also makes him near to Detective Sherry Richards when she calls him to discuss a case she is working on. Their love relationship ended a few months ago as an unintended consequence of her actions (\\"Shadow Men\\") but she needs him. She wants his help in investigating a former police officer he knew long ago in Philadelphia, Colin O'Shea. Detective Richards believes he is the man responsible for missing female bartenders in the Miami area. She has virtually no evidence in these cases and is obsessed with O'Shea as her suspect because of certain similarities to a case on Philadelphia that he was involved with and a case that Max knows nothing about.<br /><br />Max can't believe that the same man who very well may have saved his life one violent night, could have done what Richards is convinced he did. To help Richards, it means that Max is going to have to go back to Philadelphia and deal with a part of his life best forgotten. This journey into his past, both literally as well as figuratively, will sidetrack him from doing his best in regards to Billy's case. That will have consequences for all and Max knows this, but can't leave well enough alone.<br /><br />This latest in the series allows Max Freeman to deal with some issues that have been around from the very first book in the series \\"The Blue Edge Of Midnight.\\" Questions of character development are finally answered primarily through the use of small flashbacks throughout the novel. While that works and works well, what does not work as well are the stylistic changes that make this novel read differently than earlier in the series.<br /><br />The work takes some getting used to from that standpoint as it reads almost as if a different writer wrote the novel. Many readers familiar with series may not notice or care, but for those that do, it does take some time to get used to. Time well spent as the story is worth the read.

While some authors take the idea in different directions, most seem to use the same basic template. An abusive man physically strong in stature with a deep voice leads the group, the abused women (often sisters from the same family) are all fearful and married to the man and the children are abused. Everything is done in the name of religion, which allows the author to lecture the reader about the evils of religion gone amok. This is exactly what Nevada Barr does in her latest offering, \\"Hard Truth.\\"<br /><br />Newly married Ranger Anna Pigeon has been assigned to Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. Beyond the usual park problems, the staff has been severely stressed by the recent disappearance of three young girls while in the park from a nearby breakaway Mormon sect. The girls, with their youth leader, were left in the park while other members of the group hiked out. The young girls disappeared and despite constant searches and investigations into everyone's background, especially the youth leader, the three girls have not been found.<br /><br />Then two of the girls stumble out of the woods at the Sprague Lake Handicamp and straight into the arms of a paraplegic and her elderly Aunt. Heath, a climber, has been confined to a wheelchair since falling and receiving severe injuries approximately nine months earlier on Longs Peak. Despite the fact that she is lucky to even be alive according to everyone else, she doesn't think so. Mad at the world for her injury and her own body for failing to heal so that she can walk again, she has slid into a deep angry depression that even her no nonsense Aunt, Gwendolyn Littleton, can't get her out. But when confronted by two children, clearly deeply traumatized on a physical as well as an emotional level, Heath is forced to reassess her life.<br /><br />Coming from opposite ends of the spectrum in personality and motivation, Heath and Anna have a tenuous working relationship as they begin to investigate what happened. Heath exploits the bond she made with one child while Anna exploits her position as District Ranger to investigate a case that the sect does not want investigated in any way. A third child is still missing and both Anna and Heath wonder if she is still alive. What happened out there in the woods? And for Anna, she also wonders why the return of the children has coincided with other strange events in the park.<br /><br />This isn't the first time Nevada Barr has considered the concept of pure evil and no doubt won't be the last. Once again she tries to define it, to show its human face, to explain it, and deal with an evil that is almost perfect in its ability. As such, much of what she has written before, Molly's lectures and advice, etc. is dusted off and placed before readers once again. This lends a certain redundancy to the work, as much of what is in this novel seems to have had the identifying names changed and little else.<br /><br />Because of that fact, some factual location errors, and the for the most part stereotypical characters, the read is average at best. While the tale itself is interesting and does hold reader attention, the noted flaws remain prevalent from start to finish. Of course, like everything else in life, your experience may vary.<br /><br />Kevin R.

It begins, as so many do, through the eyes of a demented, albeit successful and talented serial killer. He prefers his victims to be young, female, and bicycle riders though when suitable provoked, will kill outside his target group. He likes to chop up the bicycles and their gear before disposing of it. He also likes to chop up his victims as well and always saves a cut or two for his own private selection. He is known as \\"the specialist.\\"<br /><br />For Kirsten Knelsen, jewelry designer in Vancouver, Canada, she has never heard of such things and she knows nothing about the ongoing search for the specialist half a word away in Tasmania. What she does know is that her somewhat eccentric sister Emma who is wealthy and likes to see the world on her bicycle was supposed to have arrived by now on a specific ferry and then taken a specific road to Kristen's home. But, she never arrived and after explaining to Kristen that without any evidence of anything the police can't help, she is more frustrated than ever.<br /><br />Kristen checks out the area where she should have arrived and finds nothing. It is only later, much later in fact, having made no progress above ground, that she finds a clue underground. While exploring a here to fore unknown cave with a group of spelunking friends, she discovers a ring that she made Emma years ago. The fact that the ruing is here, deep in a passageway in the cave is proof that something bad has happened to Emma. Kristen's subsequent search, above and below ground, leads her right to the specialist.<br /><br />As in most books of this type, the point of view shifts from the serial killer to the detective/intended victim, which is Kristen in this case, and back again. While at times, the view does shift to other characters in the periphery of the investigation in typical thriller fashion, the point of view always returns quickly to the specialist and Kristen.  In so doing, the clash between the sophisticated killer and the plucky amateur is pushed hard and almost inevitable in the choosing of setting and delivery.<br /><br />Beyond the fact that this novel is typical hungry serial killer fare, the work turns on a heavily contrived act of coincidence. The discovery of the ring creates an almost laugh out loud moment and shatters the necessary willing suspension of disbelief for the reader. Such a stumble makes it very hard to overlook the fact that for most of this work, it is well written for its genre and not something easily forgotten once the book is closed.<br /><br />Kevin R.

This time, the body is a dead woman posed on the banks of the Mississippi facing the lights of St. Paul. She is on display for all to see but for reasons Lucas Davenport and others do not yet realize. She has been whipped with something that has left long marks on her body from her collarbone to her knees. The depths of the blows, some directly on top of others and therefore deepening the original cuts, might have killed her. But the killer left no doubt when he slashed her throat. Her name was Angela Larson and she had been a young vibrant college student. Minneapolis Detective Sloan needs Lucas' help on this and more than that he wants permission from his old friend to call Elle, Luca's friend.<br /><br />Sister Mary Joseph, \\"Elle,\\" is head of the Department of Psychology at St. Anne's College and has known Lucas since both were in kindergarten. While their life paths diverged, she went to the convent and he into police work eventually rising to his current position as head of The Office of Regional Research in the BCA; they both deal with crime, murder, and the aftereffects on the survivors. Elle had suggestions and while Sloan and Lucas worked various angles using the resources of their respective units the case stalled. When the second violent crime happens, this time the brutal murder of a man and his young son; Lucas finds details that link the case to Angela Larson. With Lucas' wife, Weather and his family out of town in London, England, Lucas has plenty of time and more than enough motivation to work the case fulltime and chase an elusive madman.<br /><br />This is the seventeenth novel in the Prey Series and possibly one of the most gut wrenchingly violent in the series. The recent trend of Lucas and others swearing throughout the book with very little provocation, unlike the early ones in the series, continues. So too does the more distant hands of portrayal of Lucas as it has for the last several novels. Despite the familial influences of Weather and children, Lucas remains amore cold and distant person. However, the gut wrenching violence which leads ultimately to an intense climatic shootout inside a psychiatric facility reaches levels not seen since the very first novels of the series.<br /><br />While characters continue to move forward in life, most notably Detective Sloan who provides a small personal secondary storyline, almost nothing is added to the other characters development wise. As such, while all the usual players familiar to readers of the series return, they may have aged chronologically, but they haven't changed from what is expected. As such, the focus is completely on the case, which provides plenty of action and twists as they chase an elusive suspect. As usual in this series, the only humor in the main storyline is macabre at best. There is also a secondary storyline that is designed to provide some comic relief as Lucas attempts for reasons detailed in the novel, to determine what are the best 100 rock and roll songs of all time. Your choices when matched to the list at the back of the book may vary.<br /><br />The resulting effort is a good read that grabs the reader from the beginning in a marked improvement from recent reads in this series. It provides a roller coaster effect for the reader and continues the Prey legacy. The intensity of the final fifty pages is some of the best writing this author has produced in quite some time and well worth a read in one sitting.<br /><br />Kevin R.

Your choices when matched to the list at the back of the book may vary. <br /> <br />The resulting effort is a good read that grabs the reader from the beginning in a marked improvement from recent reads in this series. It provides a roller coaster effect for the reader and continues the Prey legacy. The intensity of the final fifty pages is some of the best writing this author has produced in quite some time and well worth a read in one sitting. <br /> <br />Kevin R. Tipple  2005	2005-07-22

She has managed to kill and kill again and her signature style is to leave no clues or trace of her presence. Her clients pay well for her work but she is starting to get tired of the hunt and killing. Her latest target, Max Vernon, gave her no problems and she was happy to leave him dead in his room at the Tropical Bay in Las Vegas.<br /><br />But Max had two brothers, Hi and Norm. Two brothers with anger and resources who aren't going to wait for the clueless cops to figure it out. They have a very good idea why Max was taken out and plan to start rolling up Vegas for the name of the shooter. They aren't waiting and neither is Ken Staley, the owner of the Tropical Bay, who already had enough problems to deal with. He doesn't think the cops can find the killer either and he knows he can't have the publicity of a trial if the cops do find her. Lily made a mistake this time and both the brothers and Staley quickly know who she is and begin hunting her.<br /><br />While the brothers and Ken want her dead, former officer Joe Wiley knows the execution of Max Vernon to be her work and needs her alive. The Vegas cops aren't interested in his help so his long running solo chase of her continues. She is the key to his clearing his severally damaged reputation in Chicago. He has no intention of backing off and his efforts are constantly interfered with by two crazy gamblers who don't take losing well and don't know when to quit in anything.<br /><br />This novel quickly becomes a fast fun read as the point of view constantly shifts through a large ensemble cast of characters. Many of the characters are off the wall funny, while others manage to get off an occasionally funny line or two to break up the serious sections of the book. There is a certain inevitability to the read as it becomes clear that everything and everyone will collide in such a way at the end to border on the absurd.<br /><br />Despite all the humor, the core mystery is complicated and rather intense. The book fully engages the reader and keeps one steadily turning the pages. While occasional bordering on the madcap, the tone overall is relatively serious and a novel well worth reading and enjoying.<br /><br />Kevin R.

He certainly can't afford to become involved in an investigation regarding kidnapping and murder. Tarot reader Warren Ritter quickly manages to do both in this enjoyable debut novel from author David Skibbins.<br /><br />Plastic surgery was supposed to make him unrecognizable to anyone including his family. Being a tarot reader on the streets of Berkeley, California was supposed to give him anonymity as well as an income stream to make him appear legit. Warren does not really believe in tarot, as it is just another piece of his carefully constructed facade to hide from his violent past. However, he knows the cards occasionally ring true and after his reading for Heather Wellington, it appears they were right. She has disappeared and it seems the cards saw it as well as the resulting police investigation coming.<br /><br />Or maybe they foretold what would happen later in the day Heather vanished when Warren's sister Tara would happen to be in town far from her home and on the same street at just the right time and see him. Surgery may have changed his appearance but it didn't change the way he laughed or the way he sat at the table while doing a reading. Tara doesn't want to know why she just wants to publicly lash out with over thirty years of pain and heartache inside her.<br /><br />As the cards possibly foretold, nothing is over and the shocks keep coming. Heather has disappeared and the only contact is a ransom note. Then, Heather's Mom vanishes as well. Tara is unhappy with Warren's answers and so too are the various arms of law enforcement who have Warren in their investigative sights. As does a killer who thinks that Warren would be the perfect fall guy. Too bad he didn't know about Warren's past because that isn't going to happen.<br /><br />While a component of the work, the mystical through the tarot is never overpowering to the reader. Brief backgrounds on the cards are given as well as how the same card can be interpreted vastly differently by readers. The information presented on the tarot as well as Warren's occasional political observations are skillfully interwoven into the story as character development and do nothing to slow down the fast and enjoyable read.<br /><br />Over the course of this 261-page mystery/thriller, the reader is drawn deep into the chaotic world of Warren Ritter. His fear is real and it quickly becomes real for the reader as Warren scrambles trying to patch up the crumbling facade of his life.

A small town will be eerily silent, or even a big city, and while the buildings still stand, the people will be gone. Travelers of one type or another will stumble across the vacant buildings and try to figure out just what happened to all the people. This classic idea is used to great effect in this latest novel of the series.<br /><br />Grace MacBride, Annie Belinsky and Sharon Mueller were to take a road trip from Minneapolis to Green Bay, Wisconsin at the request of the local Police. There is a concern among some in the Police force that a serial killer might be at work and in the beginnings of a spree. Thanks to their software and the reputation they have made helping Police Departments since the events depicted in \\"Monkeewrench\\" their offer of free help is accepted. Their road trip quickly becomes a nightmare as they get lost, their car breaks down, their cell phones won't work, and their walk through the woods brings them to a ghost town where nothing, neither man or animal, is alive.<br /><br />They have stumbled across the very small town of Four Corners, Wisconsin. The entire town, such as it is, is completely devoid of life. Counters have been washed, dishes done, and everything is spotless but no animals, people, or wildlife such as birds or squirrels are around. It seems as if the classic science fiction premise has happened and every living thing has been catalogued and removed. But space aliens wouldn't have needed to cut the phone lines. As Grace, Annie, and Sharon struggle to figure out what has happened and stay alive, the men in their lives launch a rescue mission with virtually no idea where to begin looking for them.<br /><br />After the mind numbingly boring read of \\"Live Bait\\" this third novel in the series is a welcome return to what made the series worth reading in the first place. While some new information is added to the development of these continuing characters, especially in regards to the women on the run, the effort is secondary to the main thrust of the book, which is an action adventure read. Secondary to that point also is the resolution of at least two storylines from the first book that should have significant impact on the further development of the series.<br /><br />The entire thrust of the book is not the mystery surrounding what happened in Four Corners, part of which becomes very obvious early on. The thrust is in providing an intense action adventure oriented read designed to keep the reader glued to the page despite whatever might be happening in the real world surrounding the reader.

Make a run at Hawk and let him live and he will look to even the score and settle the debt. That is precisely what happens in this recent release.<br /><br />Somebody attempted to kill Hawk while he was protecting bookie Luther Gillespie. The unknown shooter put three shots into Hawk's back between his shoulder blades. After taking Hawk down, Gillespie was killed but the killing didn't stop there. Also killed were Gillespie's wife and two of his three kids. The surviving child was at daycare and thus physically able to escape the bloodbath of his family. The deaths were meant to send a message and Hawk has one of his own to send back.<br /><br />As soon as Hawk gets out of the hospital and is physically able to do what he does best once again, he wants to track down those responsible. Not just the people who pulled the trigger but the person or persons who ordered the deed done. All he knows for sure was that the people he suspects were members of the Ukrainian mob, but he does not yet know their names. Once he knows for sure that they are guilty, he plans on pursing his own kind of justice for what they did and wants Spenser's help. Spenser agrees and while Hawk begins the slow and painful rehabilitation process, Spenser begins working the case, troubled by the moral implications of what is to come, but knowing he has obligations.<br /><br />This latest novel in the Spenser series features the minimalist scene descriptions and massive amounts of dialogue the author is known for while weaving a complex tale of justice and vengeance. Parker toys with the ideas of justice and vengeance, ideas common in the series, in new ways as Hawk and Spenser are both forced to confront at a deeper level than before what they have done and what may come as well as who they ultimately are as human beings. What works for one may not, and often does not, work for the other. At the same time, when the need arises, one would do whatever the other asked. Such contemplations trouble Spenser at times as he is faced with the moral quandary of exactly how far to go. With the help of Susan, he is able to work through what needs to be done for friendship and debts owed.<br /><br />That is not to say that the contemplation of the morality of their actions, which adds significant depth to the characters this go around, impedes the story in anyway.  Using the Ukrainian mob with a modern day version of small town corruption reminiscent of the Old West, Parker once again sets up the battle lines of Spenser/Hawk against the far more numeric forces of evil. As in the last several novels of the series, Spenser and Hawk recruit allies who once were former foes to fight on their side because all recognize that there are far more serious enemies that must be dealt with.<br /><br />Devoted and vocal readers of the long running series know exactly what is in store in each book.

Beth Lawter has accepted his proposal of marriage and the couple is extremely happy. Rob has finally found the one woman he wants to spend the rest of his life with. That future is shattered when Rob and Beth on separate bicycles are hit by an SUV that flees the scene.<br /><br />As the vehicle with Illinois tags leaves their broken bodies and mangled bicycles behind, Rob manages to tell a good samaritan the license plate before losing consciousness. While paramedics are able to help Rob, as is the hospital he is soon transported to, nothing can be done for Beth who died at the scene. Rob is devastated and his recovery, both physically and mentally, certainly isn't helped by the fact that the negligent driver is allowed to get away with it by the courts.<br /><br />Rob becomes obsessed with making the driver pay one way or the other. Something the man who identifies himself as Trey Wright plays upon when he comes to Rob with a plan. There is a secret organization known to its members as \\"The Circle.\\"  Each member is a survivor looking to make the person who killed a loved one pay the ultimate price of death. Trey pulls Rob into a scheme for vengeance that backfires in ways Rob never saw coming.<br /><br />Like in his enjoyable novel \\"Abducted\\" justice is a theme in this work. In this case, the justice theme takes the form of vigilante justice something that has been explored in countless movies and books over the years. However, instead of the often cartoonish violence surrounding the concept frequently used in other works, here the author explores the emotional angles to the concept.  Not only the motivations for the act, but the guilt as well as joy after justice is served is explored through several characters besides Rob. In interesting secondary storylines, obsession in the form of a young student's attentions upon an older teacher is also explored as well as the idea that the mistakes of the past are never really over for anyone.<br /><br />The result is a fast and fun read that features interesting characters, a few twists and plenty of action to keep the reader tuning the page. In so doing, the author puts his own spin on the age old question as to how far one would go to right a wrong.

They simply aren't reviewed. Much like \\"direct to video\\" in the movie industry, such books are considered as to be unworthy of a review and thus aren't covered. As my work over the years as well as my thoughts when I have commented on the subject should make clear, I don't care which publisher put the book into print or how it arrived. I just want a good story worth reading. Author Brian Pinkerton certainly delivers while working a premise all too real for parents.<br /><br />Every parent's nightmare comes alive in this novel titled \\"Abducted\\" which also provides one very good read. Returning home from a night out celebrating her decision to leave her corporate job and be a stay at home mom for their young son, Anita and her husband Dennis Sherwood are immediately concerned. Not only is the nanny's car missing from the usual spot at the curb outside their home, but also the house is silent when they enter. Their nanny does not meet them and a quick check confirms Tim is not in his crib as he was just a couple of hours earlier. Not only are Pam and Tim both missing, so too is the cash that Dennis had hidden in a drawer.<br /><br />The police become involved and Pam quickly makes clear that she has no intention of giving the child back. Pam has betrayed their trust and is convinced that no matter the outcome, she has done the right thing. Powerless to stop her, Anita can only stand by as the unthinkable happens and her world comes crashing down with drastic repercussions for everyone.<br /><br />This engaging read quickly becomes a roller coaster ride of emotion as the reader is pulled into Anita's world. A world where few can be trusted, even those she had always counted on, to help her search for her child against all odds. Betrayal is a strong theme of the work as well as justice and both run heavily throughout the work.<br /><br />However, while those themes are clear and covered, they do not make the novel a heavy or complex read.

What he has been told about him may in fact be nothing more than lies. Raised first by his mentally ill mother and then later by grandparents, Cole has always been haunted by the question. That theme becomes the focus of the latest Robert Crais novel, \\"The Forgotten Man.\\"<br /><br />Cole is still dealing with the fact that Lucy and her son, Ben, have left him behind as well as other recent events. His personal life has taken a tremendous toll on him physically and mentally with one sign of it being that he hasn't been seen out in public or at his office in weeks. As the novel begins, Cole is asked to come out to a crime scene by Detective Kelly Diaz of the LAPD. It isn't the first time P. I. Cole has been asked to come to a crime scene. What makes it different this time is, according to Diaz, the man as he died told her he was Cole's father and was looking for him.<br /><br />Forced into going to the crime scene to look at a man who he wouldn't be able to recognize even if it was his father, Cole gradually moves back into the land of the living.  Not only does he begin to once again appear in his office, he begins to work the case driven by a need to know if it was his father. After all, not only did the man tell Diaz that he was Cole's father, he was carrying press clippings featuring various news stories about Cole and his cases.  He does it, not because he really believes the man was his father, but because he needs something to do to occupy his mind and tamp down his always prevalent self-destructive impulses. Since the aftermath of Ben's kidnapping and the violent rescue, which resulted in their leaving town, Cole has been in a deep depression. Now he has a mission. Identify the deceased and investigate the circumstances surround his death.<br /><br />While the novel does involve other characters, the work primarily revolves around Cole and his resurrection. Cole faces great trials, both physical and mental, and by the time he is through, as in any resurrection style story, he has becomes reborn in a sense. In so doing, the further emotional evolution of the character, especially across the last several novels, continues.<br /><br />While it does, Robert Crais does not allow that exploration and thematic messages, to get in the way of an outstanding story. Featuring interesting characters, a complex mystery, and plenty of action, this latest novel in the Elvis Cole series is another strong read and should please his legion of fans.<br /><br />(...)great trials, both physical and mental, and by the time he is through, as in any resurrection style story, he has becomes reborn in a sense.

His future was changed forever by a justice system that ignored his claim of self-defense. It has been nine years since his release but the fear of prison, the fragility of freedom, is something that is always there in the back of his mind.<br /><br />His rebuilt life begins to unravel when he gets a strange cell phone call from his pregnant wife-or at least from her cell number. A photograph appears of a man mockingly waving at him. Considering how rare his wife, Olivia, used the camera equipped cell phone, Matt is perplexed. The man seems proud of himself and Matt has no idea who he is. Matt's emotions quickly get the better of him when a second call comes in from her phone. This time it is a video sequence that seems to depict his wife cheating on him with the man from the still picture.<br /><br />Matt can't reach her where she is supposed to be and when he finally does, he realizes without a doubt that his beautiful wife, the mother of his child to be, is lying to him. He doesn't know why. Nor does he know why a man was tailing him and why that same man is now dead. Nor does he know why his name has turned up in an investigation concerning a murdered nun. He does know that he can't trust the system to clear him having failed him before. He needs answers to a past that both he and Olivia had sought to put behind them before they have chance to live, let alone have a life together like their dreams.<br /><br />While an enjoyable read with interesting characters and plenty of action filled plot twists, coincidence plays a heavy role in the work almost to the point of absurdity. All the coincidences can't be detailed in this review as to do so would remove any need whatsoever to read the book. However, there are so many, including two in the final twist sequence, that the read generates a laugh out loud moment as opposed to the shocking suspense intended.<br /><br />However, if the reader can totally suspend disbelief for the entire 370-page novel, the result is an entertaining read that easily passes a few hours.

People are losing the ability to think. Television has destroyed us. I'm glad I won't live to see the worst of it.'\\" (Dry Heat, Page 73)<br /><br />History and the dead, victims of crime or otherwise, have been constant themes of this enjoyable series.  So too has been the price of progress and resulting urban sprawl and what that has done to Phoenix, Arizona and the surrounding area. Those themes continue in this third novel of the series, which also deals with modern day realities of the Russian Mafia and terrorism.<br /><br />In 1948 the body of FBI Agent John Pilgrim was found floating in a canal outside what was then small city of Phoenix, Arizona. Over 200 agents spent more than two months working the case before it was ruled a suicide and buried by FBI management. Now, an elderly homeless man has been found dead, floating in a swimming pool, at approximately the same location. Homeless people die everyday across this country and that isn't why the media are circling above by helicopter or clogging the neighborhood streets below with satellite trucks. Word is already out that the dead homeless man had the dead agent's badge. A badge that vanished in 1948 and never found, was sewn inside the dead man's coat.<br /><br />An interagency taskforce is formed and launches an investigation with all the political backstabbing and power plays that go along with such things. Assigned to the case, Deputy Sheriff David Mapstone should be focused entirely at the matter at hand but he can't focus that well. Recently married to Deputy Lindsey, he knows how lucky he is and is reminded thanks to the death of a good friend and mentor, how fragile life is. When the Russian Mafia begins to retaliate for the success of Lindsey's team that stopped dead a multi million dollar fraud operation using stolen credit card identities, both Lindsey and David are forced to go into hiding. Hiding is something that neither one is good at, especially with Mapstone pushed to solve his own case.<br /><br />Containing twists and at times intense action, this novel continues the overall character story arc begun in the first novel \\"Concrete Desert.\\" Enjoyable as the others, this novel does have more of a melancholy feel to it. Without giving too much away it is safe to say that some decisions for the future have to be made and the ending has enough wiggle room that it can be interpreted in two different ways.<br /><br />Not to say both cases aren't satisfactorily resolved, because they are. While the Russian Mafia case is resolved pretty much as expected, the Pilgrim case has one final twist at the end that is shocking in its simplicity. Little new is added to the characters as the novel has Mapstone contemplating not only the past of Phoenix and what progress has done to the city in the last fifty plus years, but his own checkered and complex past and recent developments. Some of this ground has been covered before in \\"Concrete Desert\\" and \\"Camelback Falls\\" but is more of a constant presence in this novel. While containing plenty of action and complex cases, this book is a more introspective work and as such has a more melancholy feel than the previous two.<br /><br />However, do not let that deter you from another excellent book in the series. As always, Jon Talton delivers a read full of interesting characters, vivid descriptive settings, and a pair of complex cases.

Without giving too much away it is safe to say that some decisions for the future have to be made and the ending has enough wiggle room that it can be interpreted in two different ways. <br /> <br />Not to say both cases aren't satisfactorily resolved, because they are. While the Russian Mafia case is resolved pretty much as expected, the Pilgrim case has one final twist at the end that is shocking in its simplicity. Little new is added to the characters as the novel has Mapstone contemplating not only the past of Phoenix and what progress has done to the city in the last fifty plus years, but his own checkered and complex past and recent developments. Some of this ground has been covered before in \\"Concrete Desert\\" and \\"Camelback Falls\\" but is more of a constant presence in this novel. While containing plenty of action and complex cases, this book is a more introspective work and as such has a more melancholy feel than the previous two. <br /> <br />However, do not let that deter you from another excellent book in the series. As always, Jon Talton delivers a read full of interesting characters, vivid descriptive settings, and a pair of complex cases. The result is another twisting tale of the past and present and one very good book. <br /> <br /> <br />Dry Heat (A David Mapstone Mystery) <br />By Jon Talton <br />Thomas Dunne Books <br />[...]  <br />ISBN 0-312-33385-4 <br />Hardback <br />$22.95 US <br />$32.95 Canada <br /> <br />Earlier Books in the series are \\"Camelback Falls\\" and \\" <br />Concrete Desert.\\" Because of the overriding story arcs, I would strongly suggest that they be read in order. <br /> <br /> <br />Kevin R.

While their office in a strip shopping center on the east side of Nashville, Tennessee is modest, it suits their purposes fine. It is there where they meet a walk in client by the name of Molly Saint.<br /><br />Molly has a problem with her husband, Damon Saint. She does not really know the man even after several years of marriage. He never told her much about his past beyond the fact that he was a Vietnam vet and that he claimed to have done some sort of covert operations on behalf of the Government. Then there is the shadowy group he says he belongs to that consists of a number of former vets who occasionally need his help. While there were a lot of things she didn't know about him, or why he forbade her to go into the basement of their home for any reason, what has her concerned now is that his behavior has changed in recent weeks. While nothing has actually happened, she feels threatened by him. Greg does not really feel anything is going on but since Jill is concerned, they take the case.<br /><br />Molly soon vanishes and as the McKenzies dig into Damon Saint's background while they look for her, it begins to look like she was right and her disappearance might have been foul play. At the same time, they are working a case of financial fraud at a local restaurant and Greg might have figured out who fired the fatal shot that took down the Federal Reserve Chairman at a local hotel. In short, the McKenzies have their hands full before Damon begins to get seriously annoyed with their snooping.<br /><br />Picking up a short period after the very enjoyable \\"Designed To Kill\\" this book continues the author's track record of strong writing, realistic characters and complex mysteries that makes this series so good. Greg and Jill are a very realistic pairing, especially to those readers that have been married quite a few years. The mysteries are always complex and twisting, and this one is no exception.<br /><br />While this novel could be read as a stand alone, due to the frequent allusions and explanations of the earlier books in the series, it would be best to read them in order. Therefore, start with \\"Secret Of The Scroll\\" which introduces the McKenzies and others and then follow it with \\"Designed to Kill\\" which will lead you right up to this novel. Regardless of what you do, enjoy these, as this is one author a reader can count on.<br />[...]he mysteries are always complex and twisting, and this one is no exception.

M. & Randy Lofficier, owners of Black Coat Press, can be consistently counted on to produce quality books. Whether they are all new novels or as in this case, re-translations of books, each one is always a work of art. Such is the case here, which is an unabridged translation of the original novel from 1911 written by Gaston Leroux.<br /><br />It tells the tale of the tragic events in the Paris Opera House in 1881. It tells of the mysterious figure, occasionally seen, often sensed, but never captured that turned the Opera House into his own personal playground. He stalks some for amusement, others for money, and one for love. When the new Directors make the mistake of angering him, he sets out to claim all that is owed him once and fore all.<br /><br />In addition to re-translating the original novel, J. M. & Randy Lofficier have included over forty new illustrations by numerous artists unique to this text. Each drawing is a stark vision that captures the pain of the novel. While the styles of presentation vary greatly, almost all depict the Phantom as envisioned by the artist. Those illustrations fit nicely with the novel as well as does the original short story penned by J. M. and Randy Lofficier found at the back of the book. The story attempts to explain the Phantom's dark beginnings. Was it genetics or environment? The question is left open to interpretation.<br /><br />At 381 pages and with over forty new illustrations, the work stands on its own as a quality novel and one worthy of your collection.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />The Phantom of the Opera<br />By Gaston Leroux<br />Adapted and Re-Translated by J.

Imagine, if you will, the heroes and villains from French pulp fiction brought back to life for another tale. In some cases, it is merely a possible follow-up story to the original work. In other cases, friends and foes unite to do battle once again. The result is this anthology featuring fourteen rather creepy stories. As co-editor Jean-Marc Lofficier notes in the introduction these \\"...are the stuff myths are made of.\\" (Page 10)<br /><br />A case in point is by Win Scott Eckert entitled \\"The Vanishing Devil.\\" If you haven't had the pleasure of reading the novel \\"City of Gold & Lepers\\" featuring Doc Ardan (also from this publisher) then the story will not work nearly as well for you. But, if you have had the pleasure of reading that very good book, this short tale set twenty years in the future will intrigue with the possibilities it suggests.<br /><br />An adventure showcasing Arsene Lupin (one of several to mention Lupin directly or indirectly) is \\"The Three Jewish Horsemen\\" by Viviane Etrivert. Lupin does like his pranks.<br /><br />Another Lupin story and equally good is \\"The Sainte-Genevieve Caper\\" by Alain le Bussy. Others beside the famous Sherlock Holmes are at work chasing Lupin and Monsieur Ganimard fully intends to be the first to catch him.<br /><br />This enjoyable anthology also features stories by Matthew Baugh, Bill Cunningham, Terrence Dicks, G. L. Gick, Rick Lai, Samuel T. Payne, John Peel, Chris Roberson, Robert Sheckley, Brian Stableford, and of course, the editors Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier. Many of the contributors are well known for their work elsewhere, some are not, but all share an affinity for French pulp fiction and a talent to bring their chosen characters alive for the reader. The result is an enjoyable read from start to finish and further proof that good stuff comes from the halls of Black Coat Press.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Tales Of The Shadowmen-Volume One: The Modern Babylon<br />Edited by J.

While outsiders may scratch and pick at the surface while writing thousands of words on the subject, there is nothing like the story told from the inside. That certainly is true in this book written by the bass player for the band.<br /><br />While the book does open with background on his early days and long before joining the legendary band, the primary focus of the work is on his experiences on stage and off. He details the inner workings of the band from an economic standpoint as well as his personal relationships with the band members. Along the way he not only explains what it was like to make music but the background of the songs and what they really mean. He takes his personal life story forward to the tragic death of Jerry Garcia as well as his own critical health problems. As such, the book becomes a retrospective look at the highs and lows of one's own life and the role one played, good and bad, in the end result. He articulates in great detail the day-to-day experiences of the band, which ultimately shaped its sounds for nearly forty years.<br /><br />For fans of the band, this book provides a detailed and honest look written in the way only a true insider could. Covering the highs and the lows, the author explains all in an easy confessional style that enlightens but never talks down to the reader. Instead, it is almost as if he is sitting beside you in some small club somewhere as he tells what happened and why. Humor and compassion for himself and his band members make this work by Phil Lesh one worth reading.<br /><br />A big thank you to Renee Supriano of the Time Warner Book Group for providing a review copy.

Bar & Grill as usual. Everyone around knows they meet there to plan their jobs, but they can't because outsiders have taken over. Outsiders that, beyond their strange taste in clothes, have the regulars quaking in fear and the barman, Rollo, scanning the want ads. The outsiders have to be dealt with and Dortmunder has to figure out a way.<br /><br />He also has to figure out a way to deal with a proposition from Arnie Albright. Arnie is their usual fence and has just returned from having his attitude adjusted on an island resort. While it could be questioned whether the intervention worked, there is no mistaking the genius of Arnie's proposed target.<br /><br />While on the island resort, he met an incredibly rich and obnoxious man by the name of Preston Fareweather. Mr. Fareweather, beyond being obscenely rich and a pitiful human being (even Arnie thinks he is a jerk) is hiding from his five angry ex-wives and their process servers. Instead of being at home in New York in his penthouse apartment dealing with the problems he has created, he is on the island laying waste to the various gold digging trollops who decide to spend time with him. Arnie proposes Dortmunder and crew should take down Fareweather's penthouse and for steering them the work, he wants thirty percent.<br /><br />It's a great deal and despite being almost too good to be true, one that Dortmunder and crew can't resist. So, they split their time with planning the job and working on how to handle the problem at the O. J. While Dortmunder may feel that everything is under control, before long it is very clear that things aren't, if they ever really were. Madcap hijinks ensue as both storylines gradually weave together with a definite sense of poetic justice.<br /><br />Fans of Donald E. Westlake no doubt know and appreciate what is in store in this entertaining read. For those who don't care for a strong amount of humor, to the point of madcap variety at times, this read is definitely not appropriate. For everyone else, this is an enjoyable and entertaining novel that will have you chuckling from start to finish.<br /><br />A big thank you to Renee Supriano of the Time Warner Book Group for providing a review copy.

Jackson is back in "Murder At  A Vineyard Mansion"	For many of us, bombarded daily by drive by stereo blasts and out of control partying neighbors, the latest Martha's Vineyard vigilante would be a hero. In a time when basic human consideration of others seems to have gone by the wayside, the individual dubbed \\"the Silencer\\" by many appeals to J. W. Jackson's sensibilities as the individual goes around the island permanently silencing those who play excessively loud music. Or at least, what passes for music these days. But when his young daughter, Diana, unwittingly witnesses a murder he isn't nearly as amused or complacent.<br /><br />The victim Diana saw, while on the family's sailboat, as something indistinguishable falling was Ollie Mattes who was acting as night watchman for a home under construction. Hated by its neighbors and the local homeowners association, Ron Pierson's extravagant future mansion sat at the top of the North Neck bluffs on one end of Chappaquidick. The multi story home had been the site of repeated vandalism, the most recent being the destruction of all the windows. Now it had become the site of murder as well as Ollie Mattes was bludgeoned and pitched over the edge to smash into the rocks along the shoreline below.<br /><br />Before long, J.W. is once again dragged into investigating crime and murder on the Vineyard. With a cast of suspects an arm long and many of them interrelated by birth or marriage, J.W. works hard to uncover a killer who continues to lash out and kill for reasons eluding both the police and J. W.<br /><br />This is the fifteenth in the series and as such, long time readers of this cozy series know exactly what to expect. J. W. will ask a lot of questions of everyone as he investigates, he will take small children to crime scenes, he will always find time to fish, and of course, tastefully romp with the delectable Zee. Overall, life is pretty good in J.W.'s world, frequent crime and murder not withstanding and the summer season with its horde of tourists isn't quite here yet. The children, Joshua, who is now in second grade and his young sister, Diana, will walk, talk, and think like miniature adults in a way that no remotely realistic children, short of being robotic empowered and non human, ever would. In the end, everything will be solved, the guilty will confess all before attempting to finish J.W. off, and life goes on in perfect familial harmony.<br /><br />More simplistic than some earlier in the series, this novel continues the overall weaker style of the last half dozen or so (with the strong exception of \\"A Vineyard Killing\\") as the author doggedly continues to work a series that long ago ceased to be complicated, creative or remotely realistic in terms of character portrayals.

Louis Gibson, head of a right wing conservative group that stridently preached family values has been found dead in the bed of his mistress, Cheri Bratton. His wife, who was the dream of every guy she knew in high school when she was known as Stephanie Jacobs is still an attractive knockout twenty-five years later. Now known as Stephanie Jacobs Gibson, the new widow gets the news of her husband's death at the twenty-five year High School Reunion. What better setting for an alibi is there than being in front of your old classmates when you find out?<br /><br />Because of his previous history detailed in the first book, Stephanie gets it in her head just hours after the murder to have Aaron investigate the crime and write about it for the editor she knows of a large and prestigious publication. After confirming with the editor how much the publication will pay, freelance writer Aaron Tucker reluctantly aggress and begins digging into the case.<br /><br />At the same time, he deals with other storylines involving his activities as a stay at home Dad, the joys and perils of pet ownership when kids are involved, stink bombs at school, embezzlement and politics. Some of it is a very nasty business indeed and combined with the murder case, makes him a target. Before long, Aaron begins to wonder which party is just furious with him and which wants him removed permanently.<br /><br />Everyone that was in the first book makes a repeat appearance here and very little new ground is covered in terms of character development. What also isn't covered is a detailed description of the first book. Unlike many sequels, this sequel can be safely read and enjoyed out of order with the first book. In short, one can safely read this book and go back later and hunt down the first book.<br /><br />While not nearly as funny as the first book, this novel provides another very enjoyable read. For fellow stay at home Dads, Jeffrey Cohen writes with the clear authority of someone who has lived in the trenches. His characters, regardless of occupation are real people and come alive for the reader in every sense of the word.

One thing she should have noticed is the fact that the most obnoxious human beings she comes into contact with often die in one fashion or another. It has been a short three months since the events depicted in the last novel, \\"Toasting Tina,\\" and once again she is dealing with another truly obnoxious human being. October is in the air and Jane is looking forward to Halloween. She is also looking forward to getting rid of an unwanted houseguest, Crystal Ryerson, sister of Jane's housekeeper, Florence. Crystal is finally getting her own place and Jane hopes to see much less of her.<br /><br />Jane, for Florence's sake, has suffered Crystal's boorish behavior and meddlesome ways for the last two weeks while she looked for a new place and a new job. Crystal thrives on meddling and seems oblivious and when warned, uncaring regarding the damage she constantly causes on other people's lives. Her new job working at the town's only library has increased the list of those touched by her poisonous personality. It therefore comes as no surprise when she is killed at the library while Jane, her reading group, and numerous other possible suspects who all wished her dead were present for the fatal fall.<br /><br />Of course, with a nudge from Florence and while recognizing the local police are worthless (except for her love interest, Stanley) Jane begins to ask questions of the numerous suspects. She soon discovers that the tranquil postcard image of her small town hides a dark secret that she had no idea existed. The novel becomes Jane's odyssey to set right numerous wrongs as well as finding a killer while staying alive in the process.<br /><br />This sixth novel in the series follows the same formula as the earlier novels in the series. The most obnoxious, meddlesome, vile character loved by a couple and hated by many is killed in an ironic way. The local police who seem to still be amazingly inept and are unable to do what Jane does while she manages her literary agency and deals with many authors. The ongoing backdrop of the agency and her client list continues and serves to prove occasional amusement and distraction from the main storyline of this cozy as it has throughout the series. The years pass, and though the characters have aged some, remain fundamentally unchanged with almost zero character development.<br /><br />For those so inclined the formula continues and works well.

She shares custody of her Aunt Jo's dog, affectionately known as \\"Biscuit,\\" with a rough character that rides a Harley and goes by the name Stark. And just like her Aunt did for years, she unofficially consults with the Boston Police Department in the form of Detective Frank Devaney. As the novel begins, he has a strange case for her.<br /><br />Devaney, pressured for a quick arrest and conviction, may have sent an innocent man to prison for a murder he did not commit. The victim was Peter Wald, the son of a very prominent politician. The accused killer was Henry Fraiser; a man with no connections and who still to this day claims to be innocent. He may very well have been nothing more than the wrong man in the wrong place at the time. The crime happened years ago during the cocaine years when crime was out of control, the police were overworked and stressed, and everything no matter how small turned into deadly violence. Initially, Regina does not pick up anything and then as he goes to leave, she gets a sensation that is almost to the point of an image for her which gives Devaney an idea to pursue.<br /><br />But, Regina isn't content to just tell the good detective what she sees and feels. Before long, she is actively sticking her nose into the case, asking questions of everyone and walking the old neighborhood where the crime took place. At the same time, she is also assisting a good friend of hers that sold a house that may or may not be haunted. The buyers are not happy and are very well connected and the outcome of their unsatisfaction could be a financial disaster for all involved. And then, what about the weird scuffling sound Regina heard in the thick fog the other night? Was a man attacked?<br /><br />Author Cecelia Tishy (also the author of the Kate Banning mystery series) pulls the various threads all together in a Sue Grafton style work and creates an atmospheric read that is very enjoyable. Despite lots of self-doubt, Regina Cutter is an enjoyable character realistically drawn and full of promise. The secondary characters, in particular Stark and Devaney, seem at times a bit stereotypical, but clearly they have the possibility to become realistically drawn individuals. If this becomes a series, the pieces are certainly there to more fully develop these characters and others.<br /><br />Coincidence does seem to play a strong role in the book whether in the form of the paranormal at just the right time or in the main story where something happens at just the exact right moment.  However, that fact along with the fact that the paranormal plays a very small roll, much less than one would expect from reading the jacket copy, are minor quibbles and nothing to really weaken the overall enjoyable read. The result of the work is an interesting and enjoyable novel that may have too little paranormal content for those very interested in the sub-genre while having too much for those readers who simply aren't interested in the paranormal in any form or fashion. Both groups would be wise to cast aside preconceived notions on the subject and enjoy a book that was and is definitely worth reading.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Now You See Her<br /><br />By Cecelia Tishy<br /><br />Mysterious Press<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2005<br /><br />ISBN # 0-89296-796-X<br /><br />Hardback<br /><br />$23.95 US<br /><br />$34.95 Canada<br /><br />Kevin R.

Sure he has football on the tube and Tara, the wonder dog extraordinaire, by his side. Then there is Laurie the love of his life. And of course, the fact that he has a cool 22 million in the bank does not hurt either. But, Andy Carpenter is a lawyer and a bored lawyer is never a good thing. What he needs to pull him out of his boredom kicking and screaming is a really good murder and a client to defend on the charge.<br /><br />He gets that when his \\"friend\\" (if one uses the term loosely as he points out) newspaper owner Vince Sanders asks him to represent the paper on a consulting basis. One of the reporters, Daniel Cummings, is being used by a serial killer as a conduit to the police in order to taunt them and further terrorize the population of Paterson, New Jersey and the surrounding area. Vince is uncomfortable that his paper is becoming part of the story as the killer keeps calling Cummings and giving him exclusive details including such things as where the bodies, missing their hands, can be found. Andy agrees to keep an eye on things as Vince asks.<br /><br />Which gets very complicated very fast when Cummings is found at the scene of the latest murder claming to have been lured there by the killer and then knocked unconscious. This time the victim is a high profile woman by the name of Linda Padilla who among other things, was planning to run for Governor and had a real shot at winning. Before long, it is clear that Cummings knows far more than he ever said, has lied about what he did say, and has created a heck of a mess for himself. Arrested and charged with murder, Cummings is faced with a trial in court and in the media with the odds stacked against him and Andy Carpenter on his side.<br /><br />This is the third book of the series and continues the author's tradition of providing an enjoyable, albeit not deep, murder mystery read. This book and the series is certainly not chick lit for men (see the Mack Bolan series for that) and character development remains limited as does character insight. In this case it revolves around the fact that Laurie never brings up the idea of marriage something all women from birth are genetically programmed to do. For Andy, who knows they can't help themselves, the fact that Laurie remains silent on the subject drives Andy nuts and this internal dialogue provides much of a secondary storyline for the novel.<br /><br />Mixed in with mystery and the resulting trial are the occasional humorous comments about the state of the world today. As in other books in the series, the mystery itself is complicated and there are a few twists along the way to keep the reader guessing. At the same time, the twists are limited in scope and not that much of a surprise to reader who have read extensively in the mystery genre.<br /><br />In short, this novel and series compares favorably to the recent works of Stuart Woods featuring Stone Barrington.

Engaged to Deputy Lindsey Faith Adams, David Mapstone is finally finding his place in life and a little peace as he stands on a stage in the County Supervisor's Auditorium. He is there along with a number of dignitaries, family members and the rank and file of the Sheriff's Office to witness the swearing in of the new Sheriff, his old friend and training officer, Mike Peralta.<br /><br />The joyful mood is shattered when suddenly Mike Peralta is gunned down by a sniper's bullet in front of everyone and Mapstone is covered in Peralta's blood. Critically wounded, Peralta survives the shooting by a thread and slides into a deep coma. While Mapstone is aware of some of the political factions in the department and the subsequent void in control by Peralt'as shooting, he is totally unprepared by the suggestion by those political forces that he run things as Sheriff until Peralta's fate is known one way or the other. Having received the message loud and clear that he can't say no, he agrees and begins to assist with the investigation into the shooting of Peralta as well as trying to lead a department that includes some actively working against him behind the scenes.<br /><br />History was a major component of the first novel of the series and is an issue here as well as Mapstone uncovers clues that lead him back to a case from more than twenty years ago when Mapstone was a rookie and Peralta was his training officer. As more officers die who are linked to that same violent night, Mapstone and Lindsey must not only do everything they can to survive but to find a band of criminal rogue cops who thought their secrets were long buried.<br /><br />As in the first novel, the fast read is gritty and at times intense with a noir style and feel. Violence is at most a page or two away throughout the work and usually appears in a brutal fashion. While not disturbingly graphic as compared to somebody like author Patricia Cornwell or others, death and its resulting aftermath in smell and appearance are described frequently in the book.<br /><br />As befitting a sequel with heft, the David Mapstone characters and others are fleshed out a bit more in this novel. While events of the past are discussed and discussed again, it is done with a subtle finesse and style, which does not slow down the read at all.

He does not particularly like violence but inflicting violence and pain on others is his life's work. Well known for his ability to wield a baseball bat with great effectiveness, Joe Hope does his work on behalf of Cooper. When folks can't or won't pay back the money they owe, Cooper, who has been his friend and employer for years, has Joe help with the payment process.  They will pay up-one way or the other.<br /><br />In fact, the day Joe found out his only daughter, Gemma, was dead he was at Cooper's having just finished a session with a debtor. It was bad enough that Gemma apparently killed herself by overdosing on pills. What made it worse was the fact that Joe had trusted Adam Wright, a distant cousin as well as owner of some sort of writing colony near Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands to keep her safe. He failed and failed miserably. His daughter wanted to be a poet and now she was dead. Joe's wife, Ruth, had said all along this was bad idea and she had reason to hate Adam's guts. Now, she blames Joe in a series of violent heated arguments and Joe blames Adam. Now that she has died, Joe intends to follow through on his promise to Adam as Adam has a lot to answer for.<br /><br />Before he can get to Adam, he is arrested for murder. Not in the death of his daughter, but for the murder of his wife. There is no doubt it was murder since she was found in the trunk of Joe's car at the airport and her body had clearly been beaten repeatedly with a baseball bat. As evidence against him mounts and Joe, with some help goes on the run, he must find a way not only to clear his name but to also bring justice to those who framed him so well.<br /><br />This is a violent, intense story that spins a dark tale from the very first page. Violence is heavy theme, almost to the point of being a major character throughout the work. With very page, violence lashes out or sits coiled and ready to strike as Joe lives a nightmare. A nightmare that is skillfully depicted, as Joe seems to inch steadily closer to losing his mind, as he is overwhelmed with pain and rage. His suffering comes through in stark and vivid detail as the work steadily and engrossingly moves forward exploring the thin veneer of civility that covers us all. This intense well written mystery featuring a wide and deep cast of characters and a complex situation is a worthy offering in the noir field and well worth your time.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Kiss Her Goodbye<br /><br />By Allan Guthrie<br /><br />Hard Case Crime<br /><br />Published by Dorchester Publishing Co, Inc.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2005<br /><br />ISBN # 0-8439-5355-1<br /><br />ARC-Scheduled Publication 03/07/05<br /><br />This entire review previously appeared online at The Readersroom.<br /><br />Kevin R.

The attacks of September 11, 2001 have yet to happen but the old blood feuds, religious hatreds and distrust that fuel everything in the Middle East continue unabated. Her expedition has been attacked by the weather, a camel spider, food poisoning, deliberate stupidity by some expedition members and a host of other problems. Still, she persevered in her search despite all obstacles including the sudden arrival of the Jordanian Police and a minister, Dr. Fawzi, to investigate the latest problems that have occurred.<br /><br />While the police take away a large group of her expedition for questioning, Dr. Fawzi and his bodyguard assistants are still present when the expedition finds the object they have been searching the desert for these past many weeks. Buried in a cave, a relic that seems to be a scroll written by Judas explaining his actions is found sealed in a jar. Beyond determining that the ancient text which will need extensive work to be translated, seems to be consistent for the time period, little more is determined before Dr Fawzi wields his considerably governmental authority and takes possession of the artifact.<br /><br />His plans to move the artifact to Amman for study and safe keeping away from outside influences are quickly thwarted by the arrival of gun toting terrorists. After removing the token resistance permanently, they take the artifact and vanish into the desert. In the resulting aftermath, as an investigation in this matter is conducted by the Jordanian government, Linda is captured by members of the same terrorist group. They need a translator and have decided she is to be their translator. If she refuses they will execute her. She knows once she finishes they will execute her. But in the meantime, she has a chance to work with the ancient scroll and attempt to translate a document that will fundamentally change mankind's understanding of the history of the Middle East.<br /><br />On one level this is a thriller featuring chase and adventure across the Middle East along with a hint or romance. On another level, this is a complex work that provides a deep insight into the religious differences in the region that shape behavior and politics still today. Using her extensive research into various religions via a number of sources, the author explains the religious and cultural history of a large portion of the Middle East while at the same time, telling an engrossing story. This is not something that is an easy thing to do but in this case, the teaching and the fiction blend almost seamlessly together. In so doing, the author has created a read that is a very good book and leaves the reader with plenty to think about after turning the last page.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />The Acts Of Judas<br /><br />By Georgiann Baldino<br /><br />WhooDoo Mysteries<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2004<br /><br />ISBN # 1-931742-84-7<br /><br />Large Trade Paperback<br /><br />292 Pages<br /><br />$13.50 US<br /><br />This review previously appeared online at The Blue Iris Journal Blog.<br /><br />Kevin R.

Not only did he recently lose his teaching job at San Diego State thanks to the tenure committee's decision, he has to do something about his grandparent's house, which he recently inherited. For now, he is living in the house and dealing with the memories it represents and looking for a new teaching position. He is also working for Mike Peralta, his old friend and partner, at the Sheriff's Department where he is consulting on old cases to supplement his bank account and to have something to do. If that wasn't enough to keep him occupied, his old girlfriend, Julie Riding, walks back into his life by showing up at his grandparent's house late one night.<br /><br />Mapstone still loves her, or at least her memory and what they had, and she needs a favor. Her sister, Phaedra Riding, is missing and has been for two weeks. Since Phaedra is 28, she is an adult and with no sign of foul play at all, the police aren't being much help beyond taking a report. Julie wants Mapstone to ask around at the Sheriff's Office while he is doing his consulting thing.<br /><br />He does and before long, he sees a pattern in the case of Phaedra Riding that links it back to a series of murders that occurred forty years ago. Is Phaedra alive or is she a victim of a serial killer who has resurfaced? Or is Mapstone seeing things that aren't really there and unnecessarily bringing havoc, personal and professional, on himself as well as so many other lives?<br /><br />Released in 2001, this novel was the first of a series and features David Mapstone, a conflicted character who isn't happy in his own skin. Almost noirish in style and feel, it does not have the deep dark mentality typically found in books classified as noir. Still, Mapstone, through the slowly developed back-story, clearly has enough guilt and repressed pain to serve for several novels. Added to that is a cast of secondary characters, both friends and foes, all of whom seem to have their own deep issues.<br /><br />Those issues, which result in engaging secondary storylines one could reasonably expect to be carried forward into the subsequent novels of this series, also serve to make this book complex and multi layered. Relationships and the damage they can cause and heal is an important secondary theme of this novel as the human connection becomes more and more important to Mapstone throughout the course of the 212-page novel. The human connection is what drives the main storyline as Mapstone works through the past and present relationship with Julie while working an increasingly murky case. Those twists in the main storyline are woven together with events in the secondary storyline seamlessly and ultimately lead the reader to a violent confrontation that has devastating effects. Complexity in the mystery as well as in the characters along with vivid descriptions of setting, a strong sense of pace as this book does not drag at all, makes this novel one very good read.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Concrete Desert<br /><br />By Jon Talton<br /><br />Thomas Dunne Books<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />ISBN# 0-312-26953-6<br /><br />2001<br /><br />Hardback<br /><br />Kevin R.

It's 1983 and just a few months after the events of the last novel and Moe sincerely believes that the private investigator bug is out of his system. The wine shop business he runs with his brother has expanded with the opening of a second shop, his wife's design business is taking off, and his daughter, Sarah, has gloriously turned two and is doing exactly what two year olds do.<br /><br />But, Mr. Geary changes his plans. Mr. Geary wants Moe to look into the disappearance of Moira Heaton, a young intern who was working for State Senator Steven Brightman. Since her disappearance, rumors of extramarital affairs and death have plagued the Senator while Police with few clues have been unable to solve the case. Mr. Geary, because of Moe's past, believes that Moe is the man for the job when others have failed. Moe doesn't want the case and resists Mr. Geary's initial polite request. Mr. Geary is a man of wealth and power and as such is very used to getting his own way. He brings pressure quickly to bear and forces Moe to accept the case.<br /><br />Of course, Moe will be well compensated but that isn't the point. As Moe works the case, things begin to fall together and Moe is able to do locate a suspect that will clear the Senator. It wouldn't be a Moe Prager book if Moe didn't start wondering about it all and once he starts, he never can leave things well enough alone. This third book in the series continues that tradition of Moe digging far past surface appearances both in the case and his own psyche. This work shares the hallmarks of the series with strong and complex character development, duplicity and greed at every turn and constant complications over shadowed at all times by his internal angst. While his angst over his Jewish faith is considerably less in this novel than in \\"Redemption Street\\" it is still there. However, in this case, the angst is more in the form of a Shakespearian morality play where Moe is forced to consider whether what he always wanted is really worth the price those with the power and money to make it happen will extract from him. For fans familiar with the series, Moe's choice is somewhat obvious; hanging in doubt is how he will accomplish righting his own internal scales of justice.<br /><br />Once again the author pulls the reader deeply into the world of Moe Prager and does not let go until the final page. This latest in the series continues the story arc across the three novels and provides another excellent read. It is strongly recommended for readers new to the series that the novels should be read in order because of the ongoing and evolving character development. That fact along with brief but very complete references to events in the earlier books of this series makes it very difficult to recommend this novel as a stand-alone read. For fans familiar with the series, this is Moe at his best.

As opposed to certain authors who detail line by sickening line the violence and the state of the body afterwards. Not the wisest time to eat a snack while you read one of theirs.<br /><br />Personally, I hate the term \\"cozy.\\" It brings to mind for me two elderly women sitting by a fire for three hundred pages discussing who might have done the dirty murderous deed by the dark of night. \\"You know, Thelma,\\" says Elizabeth her flashing needles not missing a stitch, \\"I never did trust the Vicar. He has such beady little eyes and his forehead always seems to have such a peculiar sheen to it.\\" The fire pops, knitting needles flash, and their cups of tea sit cooling on a low table between them while a cat sits over in the corner licking his paw. \\"I don't know, Elizabeth. The Vicar is a good man. But, I don't trust that Peters fellow. Always walking around in all types of weather day or night. Not right for a body to be doing that, not right at all.\\"<br /><br />That it isn't and those aren't the sort of books for me either. Though I suspect more than one of my neighbors has made the same observation about me in the dead of night. But I digress and that is so unheard of in one of my reviews, isn't it? Anyway, if you are still with me, a few years ago I was asked to read an earlier novel in this series by Evan Marshall. For those that don't know, the author is famous for his book series, \\"The Marshall Plan for Writing\\" and has quite a few interesting articles on writing in various major magazines. The one sin that I am guilty of in my own attempts to write and publish, is that I spend way too much time reading everyone else's work and not nearly enough time on my own. But, when I had a chance to read Evan Marshall's novel I was intrigued and couldn't pass it up. Unfortunately, that feeling does not extend to this novel, which could easily be the weakest of the series to date.<br /><br />Picking up shortly after the events in \\"Icing Ivy\\" the series centered around agent Jane Stuart and family continues. This time, Jane must, while attending the Romance Authors Together (RAT) conference, meet with Tina Vale, the new vice president of Corsair Books. Tina got where she got the old fashioned way and she could be the most hated person in publishing today. For some unknown reason, she hates Jane Stuart and to punish her, she is voiding the contract between Nathaniel Barre, a rare undiscovered talent who Jane represents, and Corsair Books. She does not want the first manuscript that Corsair won after a furious bidding war before she took over and is dumping the book as well as verbally trashing it and the author. The financial loss for the author and Jane is staggering as well as the knowledge that this will damage the author's career and Jane's reputation. Then there is the question left unanswered-why does Tina hate Jane so much?<br /><br />While a cat show in which \\"Winky\\" the family cat is entered goes on as well as the romance authors convention (both of which provide drama for secondary storylines) Tina lays emotional waste to a number of people in her typical bulldozer fashion. When she is subsequently found dead, shortly after dropping one heck of a hateful speech on Jane, electrocuted by an antique toaster that was to be part of her collection, the cast of suspects is huge. Unfortunately, news of Jane's personal situation, and their confrontation make Jane the prime suspect, something her reputation and her company can't afford. Therefore, knowing who most of her fellow suspects are, she begins making the rounds asking questions that at least one person, the killer, doesn't want answered.<br /><br />Everyone returns again in this installment, as Jane deals with being a suspect and the hardships every agent must endure. As in other books in this series, one reads this novel primarily for entertainment in trying to figure out which real life person the author might be commenting on. Unlike others in this series, the identity of the killer is telegraphed very early to the reader this making Jane play catch-up to reader expectations throughout the work. As such, the read while very fast at 211 pages, is somewhat unsatisfactory, as it does not have any twist or really unexpected surprises. Instead, it reads very formulaic as if it has been done over and over again and in some ways, it has as it follows his blueprint for developing a novel for publication.<br /><br />Still, the novel and the series overall is worth reading for the humor. Humor that will appeal significantly more to those who pursue writing as a calling or a career. In this novel, Evan Marshall reminds one of how to behave in the agent/writer relationship as well as making it extremely clear what not to do. While this novel is weaker than earlier novels in the series, the formula still works for those still inclined to pursue it.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Toasting Tina: A Jane Stuart and Winky Mystery<br /><br />Evan Marshall<br /><br />Kensington Books<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2003<br /><br />Hardback<br /><br />ISBN# 0-7582-0226-1<br /><br />$22.00<br /><br />Kevin R.

Both authors write series that feature studly men going about saving someone or the world from dastardly danger. Both write, for the most part, two-dimensional characters that seem almost robotic at times in their respective environments. The heroic men are good-looking guys through and through who can figure out a way, where mere men couldn't, to save the day. The women, whether evil or good, are ravishingly beautiful and can be seduced by the good guys. Both authors make tons of money writing simplistic and somewhat formulaic books that tell a pretty good story once one looks past the character flaws and sell like crazy. The difference being that Clive Cussler books, whether written solo or with a partner, are always significantly more complicated and remind one of Bond style theatrics.<br /><br />In this case, an ancient helmet made possibly from a meteorite, a body under a glacier, genetic experiments gone hideously wrong on land and sea, and an evil family bent on the classic premise of total world domination are all combined into this adventure featuring Kurt Austin and his trusty sidekick, Joe Zavala. An enzyme has been discovered in an area of the North Atlantic seabed known as the \\"Lost City.\\" This area may hold the keys to explain how life began on Earth. The enzyme, if used properly, can dramatically prolong human life. Used incorrectly, as some of their diabolical experiments illustrate, hideous mutations may occur. The Fauchard family, based in France and a legendary arms dealing family who might have conspired to bring about every war the planet has ever known, doesn't care about the errors. They want the enzyme to prolong their life and intend to keep their secret hidden from the public. Between the enzyme and a byproduct of the process that will destroy the world's oceans, they plan to fulfill the family dream of total world domination.<br /><br />Standing opposed to them on the side of good are Kurt, Joe, a sexy archeologist by the name of Skye Labelle, Paul and Gamay Trout as well as few others. In a battle against all odds that will take them from a research station beneath a glacier in the Alps, to various locations at sea, to an island that is home to nightmarish mutations and death, as well a numerous points in between, Kurt and Joe along with the others at different times, work to save the world as well as repeatedly rescue the beautiful damsel Skye from repeated near death experiences. Not only because she is amazingly beautiful, but for the knowledge that she alone may hold that will unlock the secrets of the ancient helmet as well as stop the evil Fauchard family and their mad plot.<br /><br />No new ground in character development is created here and long time readers of the series don't expect any. What one expects and gets is a virtual non-stop action adventure read where the hero gets the girl, saves the world, and lives to fight and love another day. On that score, Cussler delivers and delivers again well which makes this another fun read that won't strain the brain.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Lost World: A Novel from the NUMA® Files (A Kurt Austin Adventure)<br /><br />Clive Cussler with Paul Kemprecos<br /><br />G.

The fact that the skeleton has a small bullet hole above the eyes is indicative of the nature of death. What is unexplainable, as Barry watches at graveside, is why the dead man's wallet contains a picture of the woman he loves, Dr. Susan Miller?  Why is a gun registered to her father buried with the skeleton?<br /><br />As a circumstantial case against Dr. Susan Miller and her father, Walt, begins to build, Barry Clayton begins to investigate with the help of his friend, Sheriff Tommy Lee Wadkins. Faced with a hot shot District Attorney with serious political ambitions using the case for his own purposes instead of justice, the situation is stacked against them. Then there is the fact that Susan isn't telling all she knows, their relationship is in jeopardy on many levels, Barry's father wanders away from home lost in his own mind, and the buyer wants a fast decision. Not to mention that a killer still walks among them and is beginning to clean up the loose ends the only way possible-by killing again. Barry should have stayed on the police force up north where it was safer.<br /><br />This is another enjoyable read by the author who combines interesting and realistic characters, a good mystery, and elements of real life that touch us all. With so many familiar with Alzheimer's, either directly or indirectly, it is nice to see a storyline concerning the subject handled so well in the first two novels of what promises to be a good series. The author gracefully and with tact, details the hard choices so many families have to deal with today in handling the situation and never raises the subject to preaching nor lowers it to condescension or amusement.<br /><br />This sequel, which could be read as a stand alone, showcases the same deft touch in regards to the depictions of funerals and the grief of the survivors. These characters though they may only appear for brief snippets, a few pages at most, are just as real as the main characters of Sheriff Wadkins, Barry, Uncle Wayne and others. All are family and the result is a read with characters and scenes that flow at a steady pace towards a satisfying ending that culminates another good read.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Grave Undertaking<br /><br />By Mark de Castrique<br /><br />Poisoned Pen Press<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2004<br /><br />Hardback<br /><br />266 Pages<br /><br />$24.95 US<br /><br />ISBN # 1-59058-116-4<br /><br />This review previously appeared online at The Mystery Morgue.<br /><br />Kevin R.

In its simplest terms, Asperger Syndrome (AS) is a form of higher functioning autism. Instead of another book on how to help the child, Jeff Cohen looked at the often forgotten group in such situations: the parents. Parents, regardless of the child's disability, are often blamed by society for their child's problems and may not have the local support needed to deal with the issues. This book, as he notes in the first chapter, is designed to be a sort of portable support group for those days and times it all gets to be too much.<br /><br />It will get to be too much at times as he writes in the second chapter, \\"Other Parents Think I'm A Monster.\\" What parent of a special needs child hasn't gotten the LOOK from another parent or adult when his or her child acted way out of bounds in public? That look that says you aren't doing something right and why won't you stop the child now?  Jeff Cohen relates his own experiences along with the guilt and shame one instantly feels as others pass judgment on your parenting skills without ever having spent a minute in your shoes. Something all parents of special needs children will relate to.<br /><br />If one isn't careful that internal battle can spill over into the schools. In \\"The Debate Over Inclusion\\" he lays out the arguments on both sides of the issue regarding placement of AS children in the public school system and recounts how well his local school district has handled the situation. He shares coping skills concerning the school's staff decisions and how to best get the help the child needs without becoming adversarial.<br /><br />What follows is maybe the most important chapter in the book, \\"Remember That Person You're Married To?\\" The author gently and with more anecdotes reminds the reader to pay attention to his or her spouse. The guilt and stress over having an AS child or any disabled child is heavy, and it is easy to blame the partner for the situation. One has to constantly remember that it isn't anyone's fault and to take time to keep the romance alive. The author advocates quite strongly that time alone together for the parents is vitally important not only to strengthen the relationship, but to be a better parent and happier person that it is better able to cope with the situation. This chapter contains a lot of good advice not only for AS parents but for everyone.<br /><br />Jeff Cohen then goes on to cover how to deal with sibling rivalry, moments one dreads like eating out and going on vacation, how to deal with medication issues, and other topics. Through it all, the author shares his personal experiences both happy times and sad times as she shares hard earned insight from being there before much was known about the syndrome. It is a roller coaster ride and Jeff Cohen recounts it all along with providing a lot of good information.<br /><br />The bottom line theme through out the work is directly expressed towards the end of the book, \\"Lighten Up On Yourself.\\" Jeff Cohen's overall point is that none of it is your fault and you are going to make mistakes as an AS parent. Hopefully, the good will outweigh the bad which is the best any of us as parents can hope for whether our children have AS or not.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />The Asperger Parent: How to Raise a Child With Asperger Syndrome and Maintain Your Sense of Humor<br /><br />By Jeffrey Cohen<br /><br />Autism Asperger Publishing Co.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Large Trade Paperback<br /><br />ISBN # 1-931282-14-5<br /><br />243 pages<br /><br />$19.95<br /><br />Kevin R.

He had his hands full as a freelance writer, stay at home Dad, and spouse of the most beautiful woman in the world with amazing legs, Attorney Abigail Stein. His specialty, when not dealing with everything else, is writing newspaper and magazine features on electronics. But Gary Beckwirth wants him and a man like Gary Beckwirth always gets what he wants no matter what the little people say and think.<br /><br />Gary Beckwirth's wife, Madlyn, is missing and he wants Aaron to investigate. After all, years ago for a short six months, Aaron was an investigative reporter. The fact that, as Aaron points out repeatedly, he failed miserably does not stop Gary Beckwirth's insistence that he and he alone investigate the strange middle of the night disappearance of Madlyn. He won't take no for an answer and suddenly, Aaron's editor at the local paper is willing to pay far above normal rates for an investigative piece on the disappearance for the paper. Aaron certainly can use the money and since he sees the consequences of continued outright refusal, takes the case. Afterall, this isn't what he normally does, he only has a week, and chances are he isn't going to find out anything.<br /><br />That was the plan. While his sidewalk is vandalized with a vulgar obscenity directed at his young son and while he deals with the joys and travails of being a stay at home Dad, Aaron digs into an increasingly bizarre case. In so doing, he begins to get unwanted attention from the various wealthy and politically connected suspects as well as unknown parties. Stalking and threatening his family is unacceptable and Aaron, with an increasingly uncooperative client, won't stop until he finds out the real truth.<br /><br />This is a good, strong mystery with a very funny backbone from start to finish. The travails and joys of being a stay at home Dad are detailed loud and clear and ring true with the experiences of someone who has been doing it for a very long time. That fact, along with numerous and often laugh out loud pop culture references make this fast read flat out funny.<br /><br />That isn't to say that the only thing it has going for it is the humor. Far from it as the core of the book is a complex mystery that would make a certain talk show host proud as it winds and weaves through the interrelated passion triangles. The mystery is full of twisting complexity that didn't come clear until the final few pages.

While she is still at Dain & Dain, she is planning her escape from her father's law firm as well as the unrelenting heat. In thirty days, she will be leaving her aloof father Richard, her hostile sister Shelby, a painful legacy and the unrelenting desert all behind for Boston, Mass. She is waiting for the deal with Eddie Keene to close.<br /><br />Eddie Keen had needed financing to build several strip shopping centers which would house businesses that provided auto detailing, oil changes, and the like. To get the financing, Hannah had taken his company public, creating and Initial Public Offering (IPO) worth around nine million dollars. Two million had been sent already to the title company to close the deal and the remaining seven million would be used to finance construction. That is until the deal suddenly collapses because the land had been sold out from under them to a third party.<br /><br />Instead of reaping success and being able to prove her worth to her aloof and uncaring father, the collapsed deal means that she may have committed legal malpractice as the title company claims she didn't take care of all the details regarding the complicated transaction. With the law firm already in financial jeopardy, a fact that Hannah did not know about at all, her father takes the news of the collapsed deal as proof of her incompetence. While she knows she did everything correct, he does not want to listen to her. It is her problem and she must resolve it and do so quickly before it affects his long sought judicial nomination to a federal bench as well as possible cause the financial collapse of Dain & Dain.<br /><br />Hannah begins digging into the problem and before long finds herself a target for vengeance. It isn't just a business deal gone bad and instead, a vehicle for personal retribution. The land scheme morphs into a daily nightmare that as the innocent around her fall victim threatens to destroy not just her but the entire family.<br /><br />Filed with lush descriptions of settings and events, this novel quickly pulls the reader into the often emotionally painful world of Hannah Dain. Still trying to resolve her guilt over her mother's death shortly after giving birth to her, Hannah is desperate to connect with her family. Both Shelby and Richard simply aren't interested and the pain of her forced familial separation comes through loud and clear to the reader. So too does the humor, often by way of Hannah's colorfully opinioned assistant Clementine and her arch enemy, Melissa, who carries sycophant behavior to the extreme.<br /><br />In short, this is a very enjoyable read and while marketed as a sequel, is equally enjoyable as a stand-alone. Some detail concerning the earlier book is given but nothing to a level that would detract from reading that one. This read features a strong plot, realistic characters and colorful scenery as well as a complex twisting mystery. The author thanks Sue Grafton in the introduction and her fans will revel in this character that reminds one of Kinsey Mahone.

Then there is the fact that he has found love in the form of his fellow Detective, Alice Drinker. While both are very happy, neither one is entirely sure of the other's actions, since both have been burned so badly before.  The death of someone will once again have a lasting impact on both of them and those they know.<br /><br />As students and staff at small Brewster State in the neighboring town of Brewster get really to celebrate making the final sixteen of the current NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, their mascot is found dead. Professor Didi Terry, who doubled as the school's mascot, has been found hung in the school's bell tower. But, whoever set it up to appear as a suicide botched it badly. It was murder and Detective Brady begins to work the case. So too does Geraldine Pozy, ace reporter for the local paper, the \\"Early Eagle.\\"<br /><br />Before long, against a backdrop of small town politics and the basketball tournament, Geraldine and Brady begin to uncover clues from their opposite positions in the case that point towards a possible suspect. They aren't the only ones and soon a killer has to take matters in hand once again to cover up the original crime. But cover-ups and taking care of the messy little details can get easily complicated.<br /><br />Everyone is back in this cozy style mystery, which follows \\"On The Chopping Block.\\" The romance between Alice and Brady continues, as does the one between Geraldine and Lincoln despite the occasional stumbles in each relationship. So too does the author's ability to keep readers guessing the identity of the mastermind which is hidden skillfully right to the end. Fans of this series won't be disappointed in this latest installment and new readers will enjoy this tale of murder in a small town against the backdrop of politics and sports.<br /><br />This review previously appeared online at The Blue Iris Journal Blog.<br /><br />Kevin R.

He is attending a showing and sale of his friend Meg Dougherty's photographic work at the Cecil Taylor Gallery in Seattle.  Though surrounded by people, Frank Corso stands out and she knows he isn't happy.<br /><br />\\"Dougherty heaved another sigh. `I shouldn't have badgered him into coming,' she said. \\"He hates this kind of thing.\\"  (Page 10)<br /><br />The showing is going well and should be a success and vindication of a lifetime of work until it is interrupted by the Police who order a mandatory evacuation for unspecified reasons. They won't say why and as Frank and Meg walk the area towards a fleet of busses waiting to take evacuees away, it becomes clear that something very bad has happened. Frank, never known for being able to leave things alone, can't this time and sends an annoyed Meg on her way home in a cab, before going literally underground in downtown Seattle to find out what is going on. Before long, he finds himself undercover in a hazmat suit looking at a scene of carnage and death in the wake of the release of an airborne weapon of mass destruction. Terrorists have struck again, this time in Seattle, and this attack is the first of several planned on the city as a group of experts meet for an international symposium on chemical and biological weapons.<br /><br />Meanwhile, across town, Meg goes to her home angry about the show, Frank and life in general, only to find the man who disfigured her years ago loitering by the door of her home/studio. He leaves and she urges the cabby to follow his car because with the police tied up with whatever the emergency is as well as how they treated her in the past, she knows she won't get any help. She has dreamed of this day for years and now with him in her sights, she isn't about to back down for a second.<br /><br />G. M. Ford quickly weaves both compelling storylines together in this griping read. As Frank and Meg both pursue the terrorists across the city with the aid of local law enforcement, the rift that has been growing between them over the last couple of novels in this series begins to widen. Frank is as reclusive as ever, despite being thrust into the limelight and Meg is growing weary of her life and Frank's hard-nosed ways. But beyond all that, the author creates a gripping tale along with some very relevant social commentary about the specter of terrorism and our ability to defend the country and ourselves. Not only is this novel worth reading because it is a well written and suspenseful mystery, \\"Red Tide\\" is worth reading for his very astute political observations about freedom in America and the reality of our modern world.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Red Tide<br /><br />By G.

As always, Kerney is a hands on investigator set in his ways and he manages to annoy quite a few folks in his search for the truth.

Havill opens with a parental nightmare all too common these days. Lady's hatpins are being sharpened into weapons and carried by children, often in the inseam of their jeans, as self-protection. That is exactly what Deena Hurtado; age fourteen was doing, just days after being involved in a major fight at school with Carmen Acosta. After being caught on school property with the weapon, she is facing not only mandatory school suspension for the rest of the year but possible criminal prosecution. For investigating officer, Posadas County New Mexico Undersheriff Estelle Reyes-Guzman, the case represents not only such a waste by a promising honor roll student, but her fears for her own children who are growing up much faster than she would like.<br /><br />Hours later the same day, Carman Acosta is found brutally beaten and near death in her bedroom in her home. Not only is her body badly battered including what maybe a fatal skull fracture at the back of the head, a hat pin has been driven deep into her right ear. The Acosta family has a long history of domestic violence and public disagreements but Estelle is sure that isn't what happened here. She is also sure, based on the crime scene and the brutality of the attack, this wasn't the work of Deena. What she isn't sure of who actually did do it and how the fact that County Manager Ken Zeigler, who lives next door, is apparently missing while his county truck, hood still warm and with the keys in the ignition, figures into everything.<br /><br />What follows is another twisting read concerning Posadas County New Mexico which once again comes alive for the reader thanks to the skillful efforts of Steven F. Havill. What James Lee Burke has done for Louisiana, Steven F. Havill has done for New Mexico as he brings alive the stark beauty of the southwest. The series continues with the stylistic changes since Estelle became the featured character, as the books remain reserved and distant from the reader as reflects the character as compared to the books that focused primarily on Gastner. While little character development occurs, it is nice to again read about characters that have become old friends over the years and through twelve books. Former Sheriff Bill Gastner makes an all too brief appearance in this one but that is a minor quibble. This read is a good one and well worth your time. Unlike others in the series, this novel could safely be read as a separate stand-alone.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Convenient Disposal: A Posadas County Mystery<br /><br />By Steven F.

Despite the fact that her abusive ex husband lives on Kew West as well these days and could be ignoring the restraining order against him, Kelly has made a new life for herself and is doing rather well.<br /><br />That is until on a visit to a patient's home for a scheduled appointment, she finds Margaux Ashford dead from a gunshot wound. While the list of suspects for killing the wealthy woman is long, no one else's gun was used to fire the fatal shot. That fact, as well as the fact that she found the body make Keely the number one suspect in the eyes of the police. Knowing how the local police operate and being not at all impressed, Keely, with a little pushing from her friends, decides to investigate the case herself by asking the suspects, many of whom are her patients, where they were at the estimated time of death. As everyone knows, asking questions can get one into trouble fast, which is exactly what happens for Kelly.<br /><br />Written in the same style as her cozy, \\"Conch Shell Murder,\\" Dorothy Francis shows her love of Key West. Lush descriptions of the area abound, as do the characters that populate her novel. Many of them are amusingly eccentric and one gets the feeling they are based on real people the author has known. The list of suspects is long and often entertaining as their various eccentricities are covered. At the same time, underneath it all is a tight mystery that provides a rich and enjoyable read for adults of any age.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Pier Pressure<br /><br />By Dorothy Francis<br /><br />Five Star Publishing<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2005<br /><br />ISBN # 1-59414-271-8<br /><br />Hardback<br /><br />$24.95 US<br /><br />ARC-Scheduled Release Date 01/21/05<br /><br />This entire review previously appeared online at the Blue Iris Journal Blog.<br /><br />Kevin R.

Not that he is exactly proud of his career choices or his current employment. After several promotions, he isn't doing the stuff he liked to do but he has a good handle on what the job is these days.<br /><br />\\"Today, my job consists of selling stuff nobody needs to people who don't know any better.\\" (Page 2)<br /><br />That and dealing with moronic ego driven clients, the occasional backstabbing coworker, a looming midlife crisis, a challenging teenage daughter and a wife that knows him way too well and still loves him anyway. He has his hands full and everything is rocking along at the usual pace until he unwittingly purchases the winning soda on his way to work. Under the bottle cap as helpfully pointed out by a co-worker is the secret code and chance to shoot a three point shot at halftime of the coming NCAA regional finals in Phoenix. Should he sink the basket, he wins a cool million bucks.<br /><br />We have all seen those shots on television sports over the years to the point that such promotions have become commonplace. But what author Brian Rouff does is to take a commonplace event and then dive into the backstory. The book isn't so much about the shot but the four weeks leading up to the event and the pressures Nick feels from all sides. Not only his internal expectations in that he wants the money and doesn't want to look pathetic on television, but also the sudden expectations of others as he puts everything on the line in a single minded quest to make the shot. Unlike the advertising stuff, this is work and as he goes about his temporary job, he learns more about himself and others than he ever thought possible.<br /><br />Like his extremely enjoyable first novel \\"Dice Angel\\" author Brian Rouff once again creates realistic likeable characters, an interesting plot and storyline, and several twists to keep the reader guessing until the very last page. His affection for the city of Las Vegas comes through, as does his offbeat sense of humor. This is another great read and well worthy of your consideration.<br /><br />Kevin R.

That a certain number of people would die was considered acceptable by this company as a cost of doing business. Such a concept is the theme behind this highly disturbing, yet very enjoyable novel penned by G. Miki Hayden.<br /><br />In this not too distant future, the NEW WORLD ORDER has actually come to pass. Along with the effects of a steadily increasing population and global warming, large monolithic corporations have completely replaced governments. National boundaries and interests no longer exist and instead, corporations ensure peace and stability worldwide while taking care of all. Those that die, beyond those that die from natural aging, do so due to accidental technology glitches and the survivors are well paid. The world is a controlled safe place but dissent and freedom still simmer in mankind.<br /><br />For Tanizaki Takashi, those issues do not exist, as he is a small part of the huge corporation known as Moritomo and acutely aware of his place in it. Summoned to Singapore by his supervisor, Najita, he goes and follows rigid protocol. His role is what it is and Najita reminds him of that repeatedly before assigning him the task of finding a missing scientist, Dr. Sato. Dr. Sato has created a living weapon system that could be targeted to a number of variables including, a person's age, gender, race, etc. Dr. Sato may have taken a part of it with him and they want their property, both Dr. Sato and his weapon system, returned to them.<br /><br />Takashi begins the hunt, which will lead him to the Moon and Moritomo's lunar colony. In so doing and while coming to terms with the realization that he is an expendable pawn in a high stakes power game, he begins to question his own life and reason for existence. When the pawn becomes self aware, it ceases to be a pawn and becomes something more.<br /><br />Filled with social commentary about a world that may be coming, this intriguing science fiction mystery presents a dark tale that does not seem that far fetched at all. As the read moves forward, the levels of corporate deception become more complex as do the possibilities for escape.

It builds and it builds, taking over a person who soon becomes a slave to the addiction. Living for the addiction created within until death or intervention breaks the cycle. And even for those addicted that because of their training should know better, they are often just as powerless to stop their own addiction as the drug addict living beneath the bridge. They just use a better class of drugs.<br /><br />For Dr. Rocky VanSlyke, resident of All Saints Hospital in Philadelphia, waking up after a seizure caused by drug use should have done the trick. But it didn't and his slide continues further into the nightmarish world of prescription drug addiction. His methods of choice being Demerol and Percocet. As he begins to lose control over both his personal life and his professional life, the reader is repeatedly taken back in time to his early childhood, teen years, and college life in a search for answers. There were numerous warning signs in every stage of his life, but like his seizure, he didn't see them coming or what they were.<br /><br />As the pages pass, the reader is exposed to the joy of escape through addiction in the beginning, which soon morphs into a nightmare as the addition goes out of control. That time when addiction rules every second of every day and becomes subservient to everything else. The slow slide into madness continues throughout the work leaving the reader to wonder if this Rocky will get off the canvass one more time.<br /><br />As a novel, this is an incredibly disturbing read, which will resonate in those with addiction problems. According to the cover, it is \\"Based on Actual Events\\" while in the intro the author asks \\" . . . to be judged, not as an autobiographer, but as a writer of fiction.\\" One wonders where the line is because the work reads all too real from start to finish.

Teachers too are being tested, not just in the classroom, like never before. In previous years, such required certifications were under the umbrella of the ExCET tests. Now, the name has been changed to TExES and this book serves as study guide to those new teacher certification tests.<br /><br />Written by professors in the Department of Education at The University of North Texas (Denton, Texas), this book contains lots of helpful information. Part 1 consists of an introduction to the requirements, who is required to take the test, and suggested guidelines for using this comprehensive 444-page book. Sections that most students would normally skip but serve to help those who take the time to read them.<br /><br />Section 2 is a twenty-page guide to preparing for taking the test. Information that is aimed primarily towards this test but would be helpful for any student regarding tests.<br /><br />Section 3 covers current teacher standards and competencies using detailed explanations of both. As a parent of two active boys, this section was also very interesting as it explained some of the actions teachers have taken with my children.<br /><br />Section 4, which covers chapters 13-18, provides diagnostic and sample tests for every grade level in public school.<br /><br />This is followed by several appendices that cover websites, printed material and appropriate rules and standards. A glossary and index completes the text.<br /><br />Detailed and comprehensive, this book is a must for those of us, regardless of the reason, interested in teacher standards in Texas.<br /><br />Kevin R.

Of course, there are limitations as to what could be covered and the author makes his case as to why certain persons made the cut and others did not.<br /><br />What follows are the various sections detailing periods in time starting with the Ancient World 700 B. C. E. -400 B.C.E. A timeline complete with illustrations and pictures as well as dates is given for the relevant points in history within and without the realm of Philosophy. Then, in page summary format, each Philosopher is listed, with a date of life, main interests, influences, influenced, and an explanation of what is known about the Philosopher, the thinking of the Philosopher and the role of the Philosopher at that time.<br /><br />This same formula continues through out the nearly 200-page book. The 100th Philosopher, Peter Singer, is covered at the end of the twentieth century section followed by a comprehensive and detailed two-page section suggesting other reading. This section leads into a glossary of terms used in the book, which is followed by an index.<br /><br />This book obviously can't cover everyone to great depth and doesn't try to do so. Instead, it serves more as an instruction to a wide range of thought and would be especially helpful not only to the laymen but for students considering study in the world of Philosophy.

Clete and Dave have a very good idea who is ultimately responsible, but proof is elusive as ever and the case quickly stalls.<br /><br />At the same time, back in New Iberia and Dave's home parish, three girls are killed in a drunk driving accident. The seventeen-year-old driver was the daughter of a local prominent physician who is incapable of accepting any possibility that his daughter, caught before for driving while intoxicated, could have made any mistake. He wants vengeance and blames police incompetence but Dave doesn't want to just get the young clerk that sold the stuff. He wants proof to bring down the owner whom he suspects knew full well what was going on and had no problem with selling to minors. Before he can gather the proof he needs, the owner of the drive through store is dead and the enraged father is the suspect. But that would be simple and James Lee Burke books are always far from simple.<br /><br />Throw in a toxic dump site, a decades old murder mystery, and his usual ingredients of child abuse, racism, pain, regret, and ghosts of the past, and the reader is faced with one of the darkest books produced by this author in along time. Dave has plenty of reasons to be angry at the world as made clear within the first few shocking pages. His answer to his pain this time is not to dive back into the bottle, something that has haunted him for years, but to instead, obsessively work the cases, driven to find the truth and maybe self-destruct on purpose while he is at it. The result is a dark and twisting read as Dave attempts to deal with the pain-past and present.<br /><br />While two of the main secondary characters are notable for their absence, most everyone else is back for this go around. So too is Burke's obvious love for southern Louisiana as detailed in his elegant prose describing both the scenery and the past. At the same time, with just a few simple sentences, the author manages to convey both the beauty of an item as well as the dark side of the same item. It is a rare talent and one that should be appreciated by readers as they are pulled into this dark world.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Last Car to Elysian Fields: A Dave Robicheaux Novel<br /><br />By James Lee Burke<br /><br />Simon & Schuster<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2003<br /><br />ISBN # 0-7432-4542-3<br /><br />Hardback<br /><br />335 Pages<br /><br />$24.95 US<br /><br />$37.50 Canada<br /><br />This entire review previously appeared online at the Blue Iris Journal Blog.<br /><br />Kevin R.

The Black Coat Script Library is dedicated to presenting some of those scripts.\\" (Back cover)<br /><br />A requirement of fantasy often is the element of the quest where someone is required to make a journey or perform a task or service. Either because the person has some inherent and unknown \\"gift\\" or just is lucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, the person is drafted into service. Usually the individual is less than thrilled initially and that certainly sums up the plight of Eddie McCandry.<br /><br />Eddie is part of a band and dating the lead guitarist, Stuart. Stuart has become more trouble than he is worth, both professionally and personally. Fueled by jealousy over artistic issues and alcohol, he is ruining any future they had together as well as any future the band had as a group. After another public performance ruined by his drinking and bad behavior, Eddie contemplates leaving the band, which will also require her to end her relationship with Stuart.<br /><br />Fellow band member and good friend Carla not only is willing to leave with her; she wants Eddie to start her own band. Something Eddie finds overwhelming and she decides she will think about things on a walk home. Along the way she is confronted by creatures that turn out to be nobles from the Summer Court of the Fey folk. They are going to fight the Winter Court after some of the Summer Court's lands have been seized. Eddie, as a mortal, has been chosen by the nobles of the Summer Court to be present for the coming battle. To enhance their chances of victory, assassins sent on behalf of the Winter Court will seek her out and try to kill her. Having placed her in jeopardy by their selection, the nobles of the Summer Court have selected a creature known as \\"Pooka\\" to guard her.<br /><br />They have made their choice and she has no choice but to do their bidding. Something Eddie does not want to do and makes very clear to one and all. The \\"Pooka,\\" in the forms of a male human, a large dog, and others as well as having numerous other talents, understands her predicament and soon saves her from assassination. Drawn into a battle she did not want by forces she did not believe existed, she quickly finds out more about herself and her place in the world than she ever thought possible.<br /><br />Based on the novel of the same name written by Emma Bull, this script features an intriguing and diverse cast of characters and plenty of action and secondary storylines with slight changes to the original novel. What really makes all of this work is the element of magic, which is so prominent it deserves top billing itself. With the use of creatures that can change shape at the blink of an eye, spontaneous combustion, shimmering see through veils, and other things, those wishing to turn this great story into a filmed version will have to have the financial resources and access to technology to develop the project correctly. Otherwise, what is at this point a very enjoyable read would be ruined in a film version. Here is hoping that someone is paying attention in Hollywood to this script and looking to do something different than the normal, run of the mill stuff.very clear to one and all.

Kinsey Malone is to go to the California Institute for Women and pick up Reba Lafferty. Convicted of embezzlement, the daughter of wealthy Nord Lafferty is to be released early from prison on parole. Kinsey is to bring her back home, make sure she is settled in her father's house as she resumes her life, and complying with her parole instructions. Nord Lafferty has the money and is willing to pay for a job that will take just a few days.<br /><br />And in the beginning, everything seems straightforward enough. Reba and Kinsey make a connection and Reba seems to be trying to adjust to being back out in the real world. Then, the man she went to prison for comes back in her life and the lies and deceit begin anew. Debts must be paid and this time, Reba has a plan and drags Kinsey willingly into the middle of it.<br /><br />This latest read from Sue Grafton becomes a complex novel on many different levels. Kinsey has a dark side to her, which is quickly exploited by Reba in a way never done before. In so doing, she and the reader are pulled into a murky world of relationships and money laundering where being a good person can get you killed in more ways than one.<br /><br />This is a much better novel that several of the recent ones have been. While Kinsey still seems to make bad decisions from time to time, as any of us do, there isn't the emotional waffling that we have seen from time to time in the past. And while set in the same time frame as all the other novels, mid eighties, there is a sense in this one that she has learned a few things about herself along the way.

She, somehow despite previous disasters and near misses along with some success, is still a Bond Enforcement Agent working for her cousin Vincent Plum. And she still manages to get herself into major trouble with or without Lulu's help. In this case, Lulu helped.<br /><br />While standing in a parking lot debating lunch choices with Stephanie, Lulu decides to show Stephanie her gun. In so doing, she manages to shoot the rear tire of a bicycle leaned against the window of the local deli-mart.  Seconds later, they witness the robbery of the deli-mart by a man in mask, known as the Red Devil robber. A number of things go wrong, including the fact that his escape vehicle, the bike, has a flat tire. In the ensuing chaos, not only does Stephanie lose her car to yet another fiery explosion, she can identify the robber. He is a member of the local gang known as the \\"Slayers.\\" Of course, gangs thrive on violence and intimidation and they can't have Stephanie messing up their plans. So, while she is out chasing various people who failed to appear, the Slayers put out a contract on her life as well as three others.<br /><br />All the usual characters are back in this adventure, which includes separate storylines on Grandma Mazur as well as Valerie and her love life. The sexual tension between Stephanie and Ranger continues while at the same time she might be finally ready to admit she loves Morelli. The humor is back as well, a hallmark of this series, with several downright hysterical scenes.<br /><br />But, a word of warning as well. The risqu&eacute; parts are back as well and more over the top with graphic descriptions than ever before. This is a trend that started several novels ago and shows no sign of stopping. As such, some of this may offend some readers. This is a good series but this novel certainly pushes the boundaries, as there is considerable sexual innuendo as well as graphic descriptions of suspects who have lost their pants, for one reason or another.<br /><br />If you have read the series then you know what to expect.

Jackson and family adventure continues the slow degradation of this series and provides another disappointing read. The plot is weak, the action limited, and the toddler age children talk like adults. The whole combination makes for a disjointed novel that is not at all close to an average read.<br /><br />Years ago (and many novels ago) J. W. was a cop on the mean streets of Boston. He was shot in the stomach and the bullet nestled itself against his spine a hairs breath away from permanent paralysis. During the gun battle, he managed to shoot and kill the female thief that had shot him. The resulting trauma of the shooting, caused him to take his pension and disability benefits and move to the tranquility of Martha's Vineyard. There he was able to find peace and solitude as a year around resident. He eventually met and married Zee, a nurse at the local hospital. By the time this novel opens, they have two toddler age children, Joshua and Diana who do not act or talk like real children in any sense of reality.<br /><br />As this novel opens, J. W. and Joshua went off clamming while Zee got ready to take the younger child, Diana, to the local gun club so that Zee could practice her shooting. As a healer, she is conflicted about the competitive target shooting, but has slowly discovered that she likes it and is quite good at it. Those skills come in quite handy when strangers appear at the house. After asking repeatedly for someone Zee does not know, violence erupts. To save her child's life as well as her own, Zee kills one assailant and seriously wounds the other.<br /><br />J. W. comes home to find his injured wife and daughter being loaded into an ambulance in a front yard full of police and chaos. There is a good reason why Zee never recognized the name of the man the men were looking for but J. W. knows of him. Tom Rimini is the schoolteacher J. W.'s wife left him for after he was gunned down. She could not handle the life of a policeman's wife and wanted someone safer and more stable. They clicked and after the shooting, Carla made sure J. W. was physically okay and then announced she wanted out.<br /><br />The only person that could have sent Tom to J. W. would be Carla. Soon, Rimini contacts him and spins a story about gambling debts, the mob, and a cop seeking a conviction against a powerful mob figure. It has been fifteen years since J. W. last saw Carla, but he still has strong feelings for her and he agrees to do what he can to help Tom. Of course, Zee is less than thrilled with this arrangement and it strains their relationship a little more, but she has learned that J. W. will do what he feels right.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this novel sounds better on paper than it actually is. This latest effort continues the weaker plots, less action, and unrealistic kids of the last several novels. Joshua and Diana are portrayed as miniature adults in action and dialogue and for any parent; it simply does not ring true. Kids just don't act this way and with the kids being a large focus of the last several novels, the books are weakened considerably. As in the last several, J.W. takes his kids to crime scenes and other places that no rational parent would. My suggestion would be to skip this one and start with the beginning ones and work your way forward. You will know when to stop.<br /><br />(...)someone safer and more stable.

This second installment of a planned trilogy finds Wiley O'Mara and the six children he rescued from the city at the bottom of the ocean back on dry land. Wiley is faced with the challenge of explaining their presence in his small village. He also is faced with explaining to the boys how things work now and with helping them to adjust to their new surroundings.<br /><br />As Wiley makes plans to obtain food and clothing for the boys of various ages and temperaments, he begins to realize just how daunting his task of assimilating the kids will be. He soon realizes that a neighboring village some distance away but reachable, might be the best place for the boys. To get there they will have to pass through the magical forest that borders the area. The boys disbelief in such things is quickly vanquished when the meet the magical Lucinda who tells them to go back to the ocean and wait for Elden. The quest has begun.<br /><br />What follows is a rich fantasy tale of exploration as the boys go back in time to \\"The City of the Golden Sun.\\" As before, the writing is clear, the descriptions compelling, and the tale vivid as most of the action takes place in the distant past in a time that could have been. Like the first book, this sequel appeals to young and old.<br /><br />Like \\"The Fisherman's Son\\" this fun read is perfect for the pre-teen reader. With a minimum of violence, plenty of action, and lots of history, as well as a continuing appreciation for nature, beauty and magic, the reader is swept away. Wiley's maturity as a character continues to grow and this sequel follows nicely the original novel with no gaps in the tale or changes in writing style.no gaps in the tale or changes in writing style.  <br />	2005-01-10

As foremost a reader and secondly as a reviewer, I have learned quickly that BCP can always be counted on to provide quality books in terms of appearance as well as story. This new division of BCP is no exception.<br /><br />For those that do not know and I certainly didn't before receiving this book (one of three and I will be reviewing the rest soon) a \\"script book\\" is the basic movie or TV show in script form within a bound book. The best and simplest analogy I can come up with is that if remember reading plays in High School English, this is the same idea. And the effect is the same. Other than scene location explanations, character development and actions are told almost entirely through spoken dialogue. As such, it requires a certain style of writing and narration to make the characters come alive.<br /><br />It certainly works in the \\"The Iron Triangle\\" which the author refers to as \\"American Beuaty meets Enter The Dragon.\\" (Introduction (page 5) and Back Cover) Set in Fielder's Creek, the action revolves around a small karate school, \\"Rick's Karate.\\" Owned and operated by Rick Mayer, the school is having serious hard times and placing enormous strain on his already shaky marriage to his beautiful wife, Darcy.<br /><br />Rick is not that aware of the level of her unhappiness or the multiple reasons for it and he is certainly not aware of the actions of several of his students who are out vandalizing homes and pushing drugs. Using skills he is teaching them in advance of competing in the coming state tournament, they are a part of the rapidly growing crime problem in the small town. The question becomes as various matters take their course resulting in more and more violence and deceit, will Rick figure out friend from foe, in time to save himself and those he cares about?<br /><br />This was a very enjoyable read and filled with what could be interesting characters if brought to the screen.

They have been traveling abroad in Europe and their current destination on the island is the small village of Graciosa. Happily in love, they have spent five months traveling across Europe and now plan to spend the next five months on the island so that Rob can write his novel. As he puts it, \\"Everybody lies.

Something of a village celebrity, he is a poet as well as an alcoholic. Maddox, somewhat annoyed that the young couple has not read his works and really don't know anything about him, still decides to introduce them to his world. A world of strange parties thrown by Maddox for the fellow foreigners where the psychological tension between the characters runs deep with hints of violence and depravity.  Soon, playing on Rob and Jenny's own psychological weaknesses, they are separately drawn into a world of adulterous sex, deceit, and murder where they can't even trust each other.<br /><br />While eroticism and violence are strong elements of this screenplay, the atmosphere of the work is the primary cinematic element. Despite the beauty of the landscape around them there is a dark current of barely repressed violence in the work.

Naive and wealthy, she is for the most part happily married to Dr. Conrad Laughlin, staff member of Methodist University Hospital in San Antonio, Texas. In addition to his hospital duties, he also sees private and clinic patients at locations some distance from San Antonio. He makes a circuit every week of a different area and uses San Antonio as his center point.<br /><br />As the book opens, he is on the road to see some of his patients and behind the wheel of his beloved Jag. Despite the thunderstorms in the area, he manages to get through to Meredith briefly on his cell phone. They only manage to connect for a minute or so and then Meredith hears her husband scream and what sounds like the noises of a violent car crash before she is cut off. She reports the incident and initially Texas Department of Public Safety Troopers can't find the car and have no record of a crash in the area. As the hours pass into days, Meredith takes the first tentative steps on along road in trying to find out what happened to her husband.<br /><br />For Conrad's partner, Dr. Key Walker, the disappearance ads a tremendous amount of work to his shoulders. In addition to everything else, Walker now has to cover Conrad's patients. Something that would be easier if the files were in the proper order and if some of them, made medical sense. This isn't the first time Conrad has done something odd and Key suspects something sinister is going on.<br /><br />Meredith is also beginning to wonder about her perfect husband. While she knows far less than Key, Conrad's behavior with her has been a little odd from time to time. As she begins to attend Grad School, she starts recognizing that her husband might not be all that he appears to be and that she needs to find him and get answers before moving on with her life.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable mystery featuring an interesting set of characters at the beginning of what appears to be a series. As the ripples of Conrad's disappearance touch other lives, the point of view shifts between those characters adding further dimension to this cozy style mystery.

Sometimes he helps his fellow students solve mysteries and like any good private investigator or police officer, he keeps things quiet.<br /><br />Which is precisely why Benny comes to him for help, as he does not want anyone at school to know about his problem. Benny brought a very special action figure to school and now it is missing. Named \\"Daisy Flyer\\" the doll, or as Benny prefers to call it, the action figure, is very important to him and if his classmates found out, he would never hear the end of it. Not only is it missing but apparently it has been toy napped and is being held for ransom in the form of an extremely valuable playing card from a popular series. If Benny does not give in to the ransom demand on a poorly spelled note, the entire school will be told about Benny's action figure.<br /><br />Walker is on the case and with an occasional observation that reads a bit old for him; he diligently begins to sift clues and suspects. What follows is a very enjoyable read and on the level of the Encyclopedia Brown series of my youth. Phillip Tomasso III, writing here as Grant R. Philips, can always be counted on for books featuring interesting plots, characters and plenty of action along with a very good story. Such is the case here in this children's novel which is simply a great read. Hopefully, this is the start of a series as this novel is a success for young readers and adults.<br /><br />Kevin R.

Campbell<br /><br />Durban House Publishing Company, Inc.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2004<br /><br />ISBN # 1-930754-46-9<br /><br />Large Trade Paperback<br /><br />$15.95 US<br /><br />Following up on his novel \\"Secret of the Scroll\\" author Chester D. Campbell brings back Greg McKenzie and his wife Jill for a case that hits too close to home. Both are recuperating from the events of the last book, which are frequently referred to in this novel. Jill is dealing with painful rehab following her surgery for a torn rotator cuff in her left shoulder while Greg is dealing with his guilt over allowing her to be hurt and not being able to prevent it. But all that becomes secondary on the news of the apparent suicide of Tim Gannon.<br /><br />Tim Gannon was an Architect/Engineer overseeing the construction of a new beachfront condominium complex known as \\"The Sand Castle\\" in Perdido Key, Florida. Striking in appearance, it was also striking in a totally different way thanks to a patio collapse from the penthouse unit at the fifteenth floor. The deaths and injuries were soon followed by the discovery of Tim's body in his car at The Gulf Islands National Seashore located nearby.<br /><br />Found dead, apparently of a self-inflicted gunshot, the news is shocking for the Mckenzies. Not only because he was using their condo at Perdido Key but also because he is the son of their closest friends in Nashville, Sam and Wilma Gannon. From the beginning despite the evidence, Sam believes it is murder and wants a very reluctant Greg to look into it. After all, Greg was an agent with the OSI (the Air Force Office of Special Investigations), an investigator for the DA's office in Nashville, and a few other things.<br /><br />What the 65-year-old Greg McKenzie does not have is a private investigator license, something the local police locked into their theory of suicide due to guilt over a bad design are quick to repeatedly and firmly point out. But nobody can really stop somebody from asking questions of those involved and all are relatively quick to talk and spin the accepted story. But there are holes and Greg and Jill keep asking questions and working the timeline despite attempts to cover up the evidence. They soon ask too many questions in all the wrong places and quickly find out that the construction business can be murder.<br /><br />This is a very enjoyable read that relies primarily on detection and not graphic violence to move the story forward. Greg and Jill are both beautifully drawn characters and quickly become, not just alive for the reader, but old and trusted friends. The secondary characters are just as realistic and serve to advance the story at just the right times and places.<br /><br />The plot itself is by all appearances relatively straightforward for approximately the first half of the book and then begins to twist in strange and unexpected ways. Just when it appears that everything led one way, the author abruptly changes tact and shocked this reader with the identity of the actual killer. After reading quite a few books, mystery and otherwise, over the years, it is rare to see the final twist pulled off so well. Enjoy this one as it is very good stuff, indeed.<br /><br />Kevin R.

Fired from her job as Chief Medical Examiner and run out of town on the proverbial rail, the phone call from her replacement, Dr. Marcus, asking for help is a bit of a shock. He has a case involving a dead 14-year-old girl with no obvious signs as to why she died. Political pressure has been brought to bear on him and he decided to call the one person nobody wanted around five years ago.<br /><br />Despite her strong misgivings, Dr. Scarpetta agrees to help and travels to Richmond with Pete Marino. While some things have changed, many have not, and she soon has good reason to regret coming back to Richmond. She also regrets the fact that she isn't on vacation as planned in Aspen, Colorado with Benton.<br /><br />Benton cancelled it at the last minute telling her that she couldn't come. She doesn't know why and all Benton will tell her is that he is working. Scarpetta has no idea that Benton has his hands full with Henri, Lucy's employee, friend and lover, who was recently attacked in Lucy's home. Henri is in Aspen, ostensibly to recover, while Lucy and Rudy work the case in Florida. Lucy has become the target of a deranged psychopath and Henri's damaged psyche may hold the clues to find the man.<br /><br />Guilt has always been a heavy theme in Cornwell's work almost to the point of being a secondary character. This is certainly true in this novel with its twin themes of guilt and regret where both storylines slowly weave together. And while guilt and regret continue throughout the work, by the end, one gets a sense of hope as things seem to be getting better not only in this book but across the mini story arch of the last several books in this long running series.<br /><br />So too is the overall read, especially as compared to the chaotic mess of the last novel titled \\"Blow Fly.\\" This read is much more focused and resolved and does not fly off in so many unnecessary tangents as did the last book. Those that expect a more complex final twist may be a bit disappointed as it is readily evident about the midway point who the killer is though those involved seem to have no clue despite seeing the same clues as the reader. While slow to get going, as many of the more recent books from this author seem to be, once it does at around the midway point, it provides an enjoyable read straight through to the end. Hopefully, as symbolized in the book, the author has come through her own rough patch writing wise, and will once again return to the form that made her books compelling and worth reading in the first place.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Trace<br /><br />By Patricia Cornwell<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />G.

The anonymous voice tells her that if she ever wants to see Miroslaw again, she needs to be across the street at the local bar, the Blue Whale, at nine that evening. Miroslaw is Mike's real name and an employee who, according to someone who claimed to be his brother, out sick with the flu. Harley needs him at work and needs him well as he is supposed to be figuring out why the numbers in production at Sil-Trac, a computer chipmaker, aren't adding up. Faced with an intense audit to meet ISO 9000 standards, everything has to be perfect and her people have to do their jobs right the first time.<br /><br />Harley, more curious than concerned, goes to the Blue Whale at the appointed hour and is confronted by three men with a bafflingly strange request. To see Miroslaw/Mike alive again, she must pay $4200 dollars in unmarked bills. The amount is odd, as is the groups behavior, and she does nothing as the men leave the bar.<br /><br />Mike's possible kidnapping becomes part of a long laundry list of problems at home and at work. Instead of calling the Police directly, she reports the situation to her HR department, resulting in the involvement of the local Police. What follows is a cascade of events; each worse that the preceding one as her professional career and personal life is threatened in this wild tale of romance, greed and corporate espionage.<br /><br />Featuring a potentially interesting main character and exhaustive background information on the chip industry, this novel moves forward at a somewhat erratic pace. At times, the read moves steadily forward before grinding to a near halt as events at work are painstakingly discussed. Then too there is the occasional strange behavior of the main character, which at times threatens the reader's willing suspension of disbelief. Despite being depicted as professionally very competent, she does not seem able to properly deal with problems at work in a professional real world matter and has a very hard time with her personal life.<br /><br />The read, despite it's perceived flaws, is still interesting and provides a fairly good book. The mystery itself is complex and changing and the final twist at the end, one of several, works well and fits nicely into the setup. All in all, this is a book worth reading and an author to keep an eye on in the future.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Chip And Die<br /><br />By Arlene Sachitano<br /><br />Zumaya Publications<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2003<br /><br />ISBN # 1-894942-35-3<br /><br />Large Trade Paperback (Other formats available)<br /><br />236 Pages<br /><br />$14.00 US (Print Price)<br /><br />This complete review appeared previously online at the Blue Iris Journal Blog<br /><br />Kevin R.

With her biological Mother dead, her biological father is the only one to have answers to questions that she has and so far she has been unable to find him. That is, until she stumbles across his dead body in a stairwell outside a party she had attended.<br /><br />In a strange twist of irony and fate, her father was the drunken man who seemed to be staring at her all evening a she followed her from room to room in the spacious penthouse home of her good friend Belinda. Sara hadn't wanted to talk to the man but his gaze followed her everywhere she went. She had no idea why he was following her as she tried her best to avoid him as well as a few of the other more unappealing party guests. His death, at the hands of a murderer, ended any chance for reconciliation and explanations.<br /><br />Faced with the prospect of never knowing her father while he was alive, Sarah begins to poke at his past through the people he knew. In so doing, she begins to antagonize his family, which is secure in the belief that she could not want anything else but a share of his inheritance. Sarah wants and needs something far more important than money and as she digs, she begins to uncover clues that put her on the trail of her father's killer.<br /><br />At the same time, beset by problems at work, Sarah is also confronted with the progressive illness of her good friend, Belinda. What began as a possible a case of the flu has steadily worsened with symptoms that baffle her doctor husband as well as others in the medical community. While a possible killer disease is ravaging her good friend, Sara's life is being ravaged by a killer bent on stopping her snooping once and for all.<br /><br />If you have read Jan Christensen's short stories then you know what to expect. Interesting characters, strong storyline, and tight writing are hallmarks of her work. The same is true here in this very enjoyable debut novel and hopefully just the first novel of many to come.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Sara's Search<br /><br />By Jan Christensen<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Quiet Storm Publishing<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2004<br /><br />ISBN # 0-9749608-3-7<br /><br />ARC<br /><br />Copyrighted by Kevin R.

Jeremiah Spur spots the federal agent at the High School football game by his attire. The man wore a suit to a football game. Jeremiah's amusement turns to annoyed disgust when he realizes the suited man came looking for him.<br /><br />The man is Frederick Wilson Kirby, of the Office of the Deputy Director of Operations, Central Intelligence Agency. No wonder he stuck out and didn't know how to dress to blend in at the game, the man is a Fed. Mr. Kirby knows of the retired Texas Ranger Jeremiah Spur thanks to an earlier case and the CIA needs his help now with another delicate situation. A former asset, Benjamin Farkas, who the CIA would like to assist for their reasons, has requested Jeremiah Spur's help by name. Mr. Farkas has a missing employee as well as about ten million dollars missing and he wants both back. Mr. Farkas is sending his private plane to pick Jeremiah Spur up and the CIA would like Jeremiah to cooperate and has made arrangements to help him get free so that he can.<br /><br />As much as Jeremiah Spur loves his current way of life, he misses the action, the thrill of working a case and getting the suspect. Retirement is a little boring. He agrees, knowing something is not right at all with the setup, and soon is working a complex changing case with little help from Mr. Farkas.<br /><br />At the same time, Deputy Sheriff Clyde Thomas of Washington County has his own problems. Like Jeremiah, he is dealing with the events of the last book as well as his \\"romance,\\" if one could call it that, with District Attorney Sonya Nichols. Things are not going well due to different life expectations, emotional baggage they both bring to the relationship, and race as the Deputy is black and Sonya is white. Race never was an issue before between them but it begins to become a heated one as he investigates the murder of a known drug dealer and his girlfriend.<br /><br />As this detailed novel moves slowly forward, the two cases gradually come together and Jeremiah Spur and Clyde Thomas discover they are hunting the same people. People with an agenda all their own, an elaborate set up, and the ability to pull it off in brains and financing, forcing the two Texas lawmen to unite in their dogged pursuit of justice. The result is an incredible final 100 pages that simply has to be read in one sitting.<br /><br />Stretching from Mexico, to Texas, and across much of Europe, this novel is rich in settings, character development, and the dark secrets of the soul. Revenge drives the work forward while at the same time the idea of hopeful determination drives the Texas Lawmen. Neither man is willing to back down, personally or professionally, and when pushed, pushes back twice as hard which makes for a very good read.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Scared Money<br /><br />By James Hime<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />St. Martin's Minotaur<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Scheduled--- October 2004<br /><br />ISBN # 0-312-33136-3<br /><br />Hardback<br /><br />$22.95 US<br /><br />$32.95 Canada<br /><br />ARC-UNCORRECTED PROOFa known drug dealer and his girlfriend. <br /> <br />As this detailed novel moves slowly forward, the two cases gradually come together and Jeremiah Spur and Clyde Thomas discover they are hunting the same people.

Teaching seniors as well as younger players and happily married to Missy, things are going very well. He especially enjoys certain aspects of his work, like teaching one of his younger students, Miriam \\"Mimi\\" Collins.<br /><br />Thanks to his help, she has moved strongly up the tennis rankings and is now ranked number two locally and at Sate level. The eighteen-year-old star is the pride of the Club. Attractive and talented she should go far. But, unknown to him as he drinks his morning coffee while distant fire and police sirens wail on the morning air, Mimi is dead.<br /><br />Mimi has been found dead in a second floor room of the neighboring Ashley Plantation thanks to an anonymous phone tip according to a television news report. The news is shocking and soon made worse by the fact that Palmer becomes the number one suspect. Soon, as the media watch intensifies, his wife Missy vanishes. Forced to run to clear his name, Palmer receives help from unlikely sources in his search for the real killer and the dark secrets of, \\"The Mephisto Diary.\\"<br /><br />Returning to his usual themes of illicit sex, conspiracy and the depraved rich and famous, the author once again creates a seedy underground world in a major city. This time around it is Charleston where the depraved elite are known by some as \\"sob's.\\" They run everything, use others for whatever they want, and have set Palmer up to be the fall guy in an elaborate months long plan.<br /><br />While not as sexually graphic as earlier novels in this series, as well as being better written, there is a crushing familiarity to the work. Once again, the names have been changed for the locations as well as Palmer's women but the core idea is still the same. The conspirator's names have changed but once again, they are rich, depraved and want sex, and don't care how they get about it as part of their thirst for money and power. One gets the sense that if one has read one Palmer Morel novel, one has pretty much read them all.<br /><br />As such, as a piece of mindless entertainment, it works. The story is interesting and occasionally ventures off in an unexpected ways.

It isn't a role he relishes but has little choice when the Governor forces him into a political square box.<br /><br />It begins when a convenience store owner, during the course of a robbery, shoots a young woman inside his store. The severely wounded young woman is Laurie Davis, drug addict, and the niece of Joe Gunther's longtime girlfriend, Gail Zigman. As fans of this series already know, they have had an on again off again relationship for years that has survived numerous personal crises. The shooting of her niece brings up guilt as well as painful old memories for Gail and deeply strains their relationship.<br /><br />Drugs play a role in another case out of Rutland, Vermont. Unlike the situation regarding Gail's niece, this case has the Governor's full attention. Not only was a dealer by the name of James Hollowell found dead, his body hanging from a bridge, the body of his girlfriend and user Sharon Lapierre was found dead in a nearby motel room. The deaths appear to be staged for some unknown reason and so far the local media hasn't made all the connections yet. The dead woman is the daughter of Roger Lapierre, party bigwig and moneyman. The Governor plans to use the VBI to solve the murder cases, stop the flow of drugs into Vermont, and generate plenty of positive press coverage.<br /><br />Forced into a case that he does not believe should be handled by the VBI, Joe Gunther has no choice. He also has no choice but to accept the situation when one of his investigators, Sammie Martens, goes undercover without authorization and hooks up with a local supplier. They need answers fast and soon everything, both professionally and personally, spins out of control with potential disastrous consequences.<br /><br />While billed on the jacket copy as another novel about Joe Gunther, much like \\"The Sniper's Wife\\" the focus in this book is primarily on everyone else. Beyond the occasional sermons about the evils of drugs and their addictive lure, heavy attention is given to the backstory surround Gail and Joe and how it relates to this case and the status of their relationship. Also too, heavy attention is given to the undercover actions of Sammie Martens almost to the point of being the major story line. For large sections of the 296-page book, she operates independently and in so doing, Joe is pushed to the background. The same is true for the sections revolving around the secondary storyline of young David Spinney and his friends who unknowingly being investigated by Lester Spinney, David's father and member of Joe Gunther's VBI team for their own possible drug use and possession.<br /><br />The various storylines all work and slowly weave together. While the overall read is enjoyable, I read this series primarily for the Joe Gunther character. Much like the Bill Gastner series by Steven Havill, which just isn't the same anymore now that he has been pushed off of center stage, this novel isn't quite as good for the same reasons.

It begins when he is hired by Scott Lambert, a wealthy businessman about to take his company public on the back of some cutting edge technology, to find a certain person named Anne Jones.

Hardin agrees with the provisions that Mr. Lambert does not get her address and that once found she has to make the first contact.<br /><br />Mr. Lambert agrees and then before he leaves their meeting, tells Art that the operative working undercover for Art's wife, Wendy, who runs an industrial security business, hasn't made contact in a week. Art agrees to pass on the message to his wife and begins the search for Anne Jones. Before long he finds the reclusive artist locked behind the gates in a nearby wealthy mansion almost as if she is the prisoner of a wealthy patron.<br /><br />Having found her, he thinks the case is solved but it is actually just the beginning of a rapidly escalating nightmare. Through as series of increasingly violent events, he is attacked professionally and personally again and again to the point that his marriage is threatened. He has become a target and should he accept the FBI's plan which might be the only way out, he just might die anyway. However, death might be preferable.<br /><br />This is one of those rare cases where the second book from an author is even better than the first. With the complexity of plot, it reminds me very favorably of an early Robert Ludlum where reality is nothing more than smoke and mirrors and the main character is a pawn in everyone else's game. Just when the situation is under control, or at least appears to be, the situation changes and violently morphs into something else.<br /><br />Having laid the groundwork in the first novel, this book also serves to bring more attention to the secondary characters in Art's life. Most notably his wife Wendy and his teenage sons, Danny and Ben. Not only does this case threaten the family's professional livelihood, it threatens their marriage. Having a husband arrested for some of the things Art is accused of, would make any wife question what she knows to be true about her husband and her marriage. The dynamic that flows between Wendy and her husband severs as a major secondary storyline in this novel and something I am sure will be pursued in the future.<br /><br />The same small criticism of the first book holds here as well regarding names and keeping track of the players.  It should be noted that this book is significantly more complicated than the first, which was fairly complicated, which makes the naming issue more critical. Still, the criticism is minor and should not deter potential readers, especially with a third book planned to be out in the spring.<br /><br />The news of another book in the series is very good news as Art and his secondary characters are fast becoming old friends. That is a somewhat risky proposition, as they seem to be leading very violent lives lately with little sleep. But, in the long run, it's worth it.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Dying Embers (An Art Hardin Mystery)<br /><br />By Robert Bailey<br /><br />M.

In this novel, which may have inspired the literary legend of Doc Savage, grand adventure is the key concept. And while some may dismiss the novel as mere pulp fiction, for which it is a fine example of some of the best France has to offer, it is very interesting to read a novel that so vividly describes the use of weapons of mass destruction and the possibilities as well as consequences of nuclear energy. For its time, this was a visionary book and for this time, it still is visionary as well as being a very good read.<br /><br /> It is 1927 and the explorer Doctor Francis Ardan is leading a small group across the wasteland of the Koko Nor desert of Tibet. The group is small, the land is harsh and then they are attacked. Ambushed, shot, and left for deal while the rest of his group is slaughtered, Doc Ardan barely survives. Unable to do much more than crawl after he regains consciousness, he begins to do so and as night falls and the freezing cold begins to ravage his body, another traveler happens to find him.<br /><br /> Days pass and a series of small adventures results in his being captured by the evil villain Doctor Natas. Doctor Natas (Satan spelled backwards) is the unmerciful ruler of the magnificent underground city, the \\"City Of Gold And Lepers.\\" Stunned, by the appearance of everyday objects created out of gold, seemingly an inexhaustible supply of gold, Doctor Ardan soon learns that Doctor Natas has no limits.  Doc Ardan is condemned to be a prisoner forever, infected with a particularly virulent form of leprosy that requires the presence of Z- Rays, another Doctor Natas discovery, found in the city to hold it in check. If he were to leave, the lack of Z-Rays would cause a most painful death within less than 24 hours. He is to be a slave and personally assist Doctor Natas and while his accommodations and working environment may be better, he is no different than the thousands of slaves that toil under the evil Doctor Natas.<br /><br /> Forced to comply, Doc Ardan is revolted by the evil Doctor Natas, his brutal treatment of everyone, and his insane scheme for total world domination. Alone, he is virtually powerless, but soon he is joined by the lovely and talented Louise Ducharme. They hatch a plan to save themselves, the slave, and the world and in so doing, defeat Doctor Natas.<br /><br /> This is a fast, fun read and a highlight of French pulp fiction. Much like the recent release of  \\"Doctor Omega,\\" also by this same publisher, this novel features some illustrations from the original novel, some social commentary, and a great storyline with interesting characters on a grand adventure. They simply don't write books like this anymore, which is a great pity. It succeeds on all levels very well and is very worthy of a place on your bookshelf.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Doc Ardan: City Of Gold And Lepers<br /><br />By Guy d'Armen<br /><br />Adapted and Retold by Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier<br /><br />Black Coat Press<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2004<br /><br />ISBN # 1-932983-03-1<br /><br />Large Trade Paperback<br /><br />$20.95 US<br /><br />Kevin R.

The 14 stories in this 279-page book, all science fiction, are driven by imagination powered by hopeful wonder. This is science fiction in its truest form where the possibilities are endless and the vision, or the visions in this case, of the future are not negative and involving the downfall of civilization. Instead, anything that can be dreamed is the limit and even those boundaries known to man are blown away by the concept of wonder and imagination allowed to flow free across time and space.<br /><br />It simply isn't possible to cover every story in depth. I have chosen three, that for this reader, really made an impression on my mind. This is one of those books that means massively different things to different readers so your favorites would vary. And I suspect, years from now when I read this book again, my selections would change as well. That is the mark of truly great literature.<br /><br />\\"Time, as it evaporates...\\" (Page 91) opens with a city where time as if it were a lake, floats above. The level is slowly receding and compressing downward on the citizens of the town. The city has survived the rip in time until now, but the pool is diminishing and their days are numbered with no escape. Or is there?<br /><br />\\"Watch Me When I Sleep\\" (Page 152) on its simplest level, is about a young boy who, while he slept, accidentally swallowed a fairy. This story was included in the \\"2002 Year's Best Fantasy and Horror\\" for good reasons.<br /><br />\\"Footprints In The Snow\\" (Page 185) details a group that makes an annual pilgrimage high above the tundra line in the mountains. As their numbers slowly shrink every year, they keep faith with their purpose.<br /><br />While those are just three examples of the work in this book, there is a stunning variation in subject matter, perspective, and vision of the future.  Each story, written in the Jules Verne style by a modern author, shows incredible use of imagination and hope. These are not the downer cataclysmic end of the world type stories so often found today masquerading as science fiction. This is how science fiction used to be.<br /><br />This book, courtesy of Black Coat Press, is another wonderful example of a publisher crossing continents to bring little known authors, at least in America, to a new audience. Owned and operated by Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier, Black Coat Press books seem to always be quality novels worth reading over and over again.  Whether the book is from the Doctor Omega series (sure to interest fans of Dr. Who), the Holmes vs. Lupine series, or this book, the stories are complex with interesting and varied characters. Additionally, the cover art and illustrations as well as the books themselves in terms of the printing process are always top notch.<br /><br />This book in particular is a definite must read for science fiction fans hungry for a read where wonder and the imagination are still acceptable. Not everything has to be a doom and gloom future and it is nice once again to read a work that sees the positives.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />The Night Orchid: Conan Doyle In Toulouse<br /><br />By Jean-Claude Dunyach<br /><br />Adapted In English By Sheryl Curtis, Jean-Louis Trudel, Dominique Bennett, and Ann Cale<br /><br />Black Coat Press<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2004<br /><br />ISBN # 0-9740711-7-X<br /><br />Large Trade Paperback<br /><br />$20.95 US<br /><br />Kevin R.

Everyone knows what humans eat. But what do the animals eat? As the author puts it in rhyme at the beginning:<br /><br />\\"Just Imagine<br /><br />Imagine if we all could eat/nothing but our favorite treat, /eating where and when we're able, / never seated at a table.\\"<br /><br />From learning that Gorillas prefer bamboo, that Koala's will only eat eucalyptus leave, to the tickbird that eats pests off the Rhino's back, we find out some of the items that various birds and animals like to eat. The information is present in small rhyming poems of four lines using simple words that children can understand.<br /><br />At the same time, with the rhyming text on one side, there are colorful illustrations on the facing pages featuring the animal or bird described in text. Painted by the author, the illustrations are vibrant and colorful in a friendly way with no creatures being depicted in a frightening way. Like the text, which is cheerful and bright, so are the illustrations.<br /><br />To further enhance the reading experience for the young child, there are small definitions of the twelve creatures covered in the book at the back. Listed in alphabetical order, each animal or bird is briefly described as it its natural habitat and some characteristics. The definitions serve as an exclamation point on this wonderful children's book.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Animal Snackers<br /><br />By Betsy Lewin<br /><br />Henry Holt and Company<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2004<br /><br />ISBN # 0-8050-6748-5<br /><br />Hardback<br /><br />$15.95 US<br /><br />$22.95 Canada<br /><br />Kevin R.

It begins when her best friend Allison confides in her that she is being stalked by Wanda Woodson. Among other things, Woodson has stolen her underwear, all of it, and written explicit love letters to Allison. But the Houston Police will do nothing without an actual threat of bodily harm or actual proof that Woodson has taken her underwear. Allison's husband, Mark, has only one concern-to keep the Police out of it.  Despite the fact that he does not think much of Lane, or apparently women in general, he thinks that a quiet word from Lane in her role of private investigator will solve the problem. To get Lane to cooperate and do something she most likely would have done out of friendship for Allison anyway, Mark is willing to double her fee.<br /><br />While Mark does not think much of his beautiful wife or Lane, he is very concerned with maintaining his wealthy image. An image that begins to crack when within days of involving Lane, Allison is brutally murdered. Devastated by her grief, Lane is shocked to find out that the suspect everyone is looking for, the stalker Wanda Wilson suffering from schizophrenia and erotomanic delusions, clams to be innocent and wants to hire Lane to prove it. Lane agrees despite her misgivings about the stalker and along with the occasional assistance from her husband, Charlie, dives into a world of mental illness, sadomasochism and mafia involvement.<br /><br />This is a very enjoyable read featuring an opinionated private investigator that will appeal more to female than male readers. Occasionally, the writing comes across a bit preachy as action is stopped so that a commentary bordering on sermonizing, often about men and theirs usefulness or lack of same, can be delivered. However, that fault is relatively minor overall and does not overshadow the consistently good plot and character development that leads to a twisting tale of greed and deceit.

That is, until he told me it was a horror novel originally conceived as a graphic novel. Despite my strong misgivings, I told him I would take a look. Though it was a bit much for me at times, I'm glad I did because this is a very good book.<br /><br />The novel deals with the timeless classic battle between good and evil. In this case, good on Earth is represented by the blind Father Michael who lives in the bowls of the Vatican known only to a few chosen people. One of those who know him is the current Pope, Pope Pius XIII.<br /><br />Representing evil is the demon Cain, killer of his brother in far simpler times. Now he has come back after being gone for over twenty-five years. He has killed and violated at will once again and has laid siege to a small Vermont town, \\"South Russell\\" while he awaits the coming battle. Father Rooney of the town Parish has sent for help and the Pope responds by sending Father Michael out once again to do battle with Cain.<br /><br />They have battled on and off for over a thousand years and the clash this time goes a little different, as Cain has learned a few new tricks. Not only does he beat the heck out of Father Michael, who is only alive because he is almost immortal, but Cain gets away and goes to New York City. Not that he is fleeing from the battle by any stretch of the imagination. No, in this age of instant communication he has a very good plan. Mankind is forbidden to know the actual truth of the battle between good and evil and Cain plans that the upcoming battle between himself and Father Michael will have grave consequences for all.<br /><br />Originally intended as a graphic novel, this book moves forward at a frenetic pace with character development as an after thought. Instead, the focus is on the action, which is often almost nonstop as well as intensely disturbing. Kevin Sheehan's powerful imagery and descriptions are very detailed as to exactly what is happening. As such, readers are cautioned that some may be disturbed by the frequent and very detailed depictions of death, rape, other sex acts, mutilations, etc, involved in this novel.<br /><br />However, having said that, the positives, even for this non-horror genre fan, far out weight the negatives. The story is well told and riveting with fascinating characters developed through the limited back story. The read is intense and the book comes alive in just a few pages and holds the reader's attention throughout the work. Not a word is wasted as the author paints a vivid word portrait of a world gone completely mad.

Art Hardin is the middle-aged part owner of Ladin Associates, a detective agency. After the sudden death of his partner and the man the company was named for, his newly widowed wife Marg sold Art Hardin her half of the business and then stuck around to take care of the books, the phone and run her own small accounting firm out of the office. Marg pays a third of the rent and Art takes care of everything else as well as dealing with her at times shrew like personality.<br /><br />A former counterintelligence officer for the Defense Intelligence Service, he has had a few clashed with the local government. As a result of being sued for false arrest by Art some time ago, the county government hired the premier attorney firm of Van Pelham and Timmer. The case was ultimately won by Art despite being thoroughly trashed by attorneys representing the firm. Therefore, it is a bit of a surprise when Martin Van Pelham wants to meet with Art and wants to hire him.<br /><br />Martin Van Pelham wants and needs someone who won't be intimated by the local law enforcement community.  His niece is going through a messy divorce with her soon to be ex-husband, a city police officer. He has a history of assaulting her and the simple solution of serving him with divorce papers and a restraining order while she leaves town won't work. Martin Van Pelham grudgingly explains that his nice is the one \\"Karen Terisa\\" featured prominently in lurid detail in the local media as being deeply involved in a sex and money laundering scandal that resulted in the finding of her boss dead in a trunk of a car parked at the airport. The money is missing and she knows where it is among other things. At the same time, her soon to be ex is part of a very suddenly made public undercover squad cited in numerous civil suits regarding assault, battery and other less than savory things.<br /><br />Martin Van Pelham wants Art to guard her and keep her safe from everyone for not more than two days so that he can get his niece into the witness protection program. Art has some financial consideration issues as well as making sure that the firm will pay for his defense should anything go wrong.  Then he agrees to do the job and before he has cashed the check, he has walked right into a puzzle house of mirrors where nothing is as it seems and more than one party wants him dead.<br /><br />Combining dirty cops, crooked feds, and scummy clients, this very enjoyable novel soon turns into a wild ride. Told in first person format, this novel sets up numerous secondary but very important characters in addition to Art Hardin for future books. Within a matter of pages the supporting cast becomes quite familiar as old friends while the overriding mystery becomes more and more complex.<br /><br />While that is all good, the author also does one small thing, which lowered the book one level in my estimation. I slowly became somewhat annoyed buy his refusal to use the same name for the same person through out the book. Instead, sometimes he uses the first name, sometimes the last, and at other times, apparently the person suddenly sprouted a nickname hence not seen before. The naming issue became annoying, as occasionally I had to flip back to the first part of the book to make sure he was still referring to the same person.<br /><br />One constant is the fact that action is the primary component of the book. Unlike many novels that are heavily action oriented as this one certainly is, character development and plot are not given short shrift. The book moves forward at a steady fast pace despite Art Hardin's occasional and very amusing wise guy humor. Not a word is wasted in the telling of the tale and the author spins a very complex tale in deed. As the pages fly by, the reader is quickly pulled into the author's world where the real world we all have to deal with does not exist.

Growing up with a love of the outdoors, hiking was a major part of my life for many years. For a variety of reasons, those days have passed and hiking isn't possible anymore.<br /><br />But for Dan Rodgers it still is and he did something that many of us wish we had done. Sitting at his desk at Colgate-Palmolive he realized that while he liked his job, it wasn't the answer for him. He wanted to be back on the trail and exploring again. While he appreciated the job and the financial security it gave him, he wanted something more. As many of us have thought and Dan wrote on page 2 of his book....<br /><br />\\"It made even less sense to me to live only for the purpose of going to work each day and return home to rest up for another day at the office. I debated the dilemma and decided that while the cost of chasing dreams was very high-the cost being failure, for we will never achieve all we set out to do-the reward was even greater. The reward was life as opposed to mere existence, and I was tired of existing. I wanted to live again. \\"<br /><br />With the support of friends, including his soon to be hiking companion Dodger, Dan quit his job, emptied his apartment and took what he wanted to keep to his Mom's in Ohio.<br /><br />\\"After months of preparation, the time to walk out the door had finally arrived. I had prepared at length, studying maps and reading everything I could find about the many trails cross America. Six years, forty-eight states and twenty-four thousand miles lay ahead of me. America was waiting.\\" (Page 7)<br /><br />They head out, moving southeastward and the resulting book chronicles the hiking adventures of Dan with his buddy Dodger as they travel together. Sometimes they travel together and as the trip progresses, various events happen to cause Dan to travel alone or with others as he hikes the trails and roadways of America. As he crosses each state, he explains the local or regional history of the area he hiked as well as his own personal experiences. Part travel guide, part history book, the resulting memoir of an amazing 3400-mile walk recounts a journey that began before the devastating tragedy of September 11, 2004 and ended long after.<br /><br />As he travels America, state by state, the author shifts from past tense to present tense and back again, often in the same sentence. This, along with the occasional typo and grammar problem, makes for a disconcerting read at times.

Living in Manitou Falls, Colorado, she owns and runs an apothecary shop with the somewhat eccentric help of her great aunt Lillian. While she doesn't believe, the tax write off for selling eye of newt among other things is pretty good as is business. She sells all sorts of spells, potions, and talismans but she has nothing to stop gossipers and those that traffic for free in gossip.<br /><br />Business is good, but the trafficking in gossip is at a rare level in this small town. Clive Newton, a local boy to some, and member of the rock band \\"The Newts\\" was recently murdered. His body was found in Black Forest, an area that is residential but also zoned to allow horses. But the body wasn't entirely intact and the killer has been every so often, mailing a body part to the surviving members of the band. No one knows why and so far the police haven't been able to find the killer/mailer.<br /><br />And while that is fascinating, Sydney has much more personally important things on her mind. Her niece, Xanthia, is about to turn 13 and party plans of epic scale are underway. During her trip to the store, she makes the acquaintance of a handsome homeless man who is also an amnesiac. As she tries to control her mounting desire for him while helping him to discover who he is and his past, she nicknames him \\"John Elway\\" in honor of one of his memories.<br /><br />Then a body part from Clive arrives in a package addressed to Xanthia at her party and Sydney has no choice to become involved in the search for the killer. As the same time, a journal from 1692 involving a deceased relative who lived in Salem is found in the attic. Are the links in the journal and the current case just coincidence or does the journal hold the key to a modern day killer who is becoming more and more bold?<br /><br />This very enjoyable novel scheduled to be released on October 16, 2004 by Five Star Publishing blends two complicated mysteries with interesting characters and a strong sense of humor. Fans of the early work of Marcia Muller or Sue Grafton will delight in this heroine and her occasional irreverent attitude towards the world around her. Part romance, part mystery, and all fun, the resulting novel is often downright funny while at the same time providing a very good tale. Hopefully, this book is the start of a new series from this author.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Eye of Newt<br /><br />By Denise Dietz<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Five Star Publishing<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2004<br /><br />ISBN # 1-59414-096-0<br /><br />ARC<br /><br />Kevin R.

Instead, she gets on the only plane available from the Vancouver airport and heads for Hawaii. But, that isn't nearly far enough away to get away from Rob's drug dealing Stepfather. Greg has a reason to eliminate Rob and Aunt Penny. While Rob didn't see Greg kill his mother who is now missing, he did witness Greg kill a fellow drug dealer.<br /><br />Instead of just running, most people would have gone tot the Police. That wasn't an option for Penny, as she doesn't trust the Toronto Police. For eleven long years, her father, severely wounded in a bank heist and forced to live his days in a wheelchair, has been a suspect in the robbery. Virtually broke, he has denied all and his family has lived with the public humiliation of being a suspect. Now, with no other option readily available, Penny has fled to Hawaii and taken Robb with her.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to her, there is a contract out on her and the boy, put out by Greg on behalf of his bosses. She is being tracked and the killers are moving into place to take them out while making sure that everything appears to be an accident. At the same time, so are the Police in the form of Detective Jack Kinkaid. Unaware of the contract or what Robb saw, he follows them both to Hawaii thinking that Penny comes from a bad family and is a drug courier. Before long, he begins to realize that not only is he attracted to her as he hangs around her undercover, she may be in fact totally innocent. But will he put the pieces together fast enough to give their romance a chance, let alone save Penny and Rob's lives?<br /><br />Featuring complex human characters driven by family dynamics and a need to find happiness, this mystery is very enjoyable and features a frantic pace with a shocking twist at the end. Wile most of the elements of the mystery are identified very early on, removing all questions, the read is still very entertaining as Penny and Rob do their best to elude everyone while trusting almost no one. At the same time, facets of each character are slowly revealed and done so skillfully, that the story does not slow down at all. As the pace picks up so does a very complicated romance between Penny and Jack that shocks both characters with its intensity. Then, when the reader thinks everything is settled, there is one final twist in this 197-page book that caps off the wild tale, making this book well worth the read.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Tour Into Danger<br /><br />By Lea Tassie<br /><br />Electric eBook Publishing<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2003<br /><br />ISBN # 1-55352-076-9<br /><br />Large Trade Paperback<br /><br />$13.95 US<br /><br />$18.95 Canada<br /><br />Kevin R.

Not only do I have several to read and review in my stack, I receive several queries and proposals concerning anthologies to be reviewed a week. However, few if any, have such a unique and laugh out loud premise.<br /><br /> Combining a lament heard in bathrooms and adjoining bedrooms across the country, if not the world, with crime and often murder, the resulting twenty-five stories are well worth the read. Some are downright funny from start to finish while others border on the twisted side of looking at life and death. Some readers might even find them perverse. And while each story selected by editor Pat Dennis, who also contributes one (more on that later), are good, I don't have the space here to go into all of them. So here are several in no special order, other than the order they were presented in the book that really made an extra impression on me.<br /><br /> \\"Nothing Good Ever Came Of A Bad Hair Day by Kris Neri (page 16) tells of the ultimate revenge plot against a certain hairdresser. Image is everything and for the narrator lawyer, a bad style is unacceptable.<br /><br /> \\"What David Was Doing When The Lights Went Out\\" by Ben Vincent (page 67) uses the widespread blackout of last year as the setting for his story. It is a bad thing to try to commit murder and to be interrupted by a power failure. They just don't make hair dryers like they used to.<br /><br /> Payback, a theme used often in the anthology, is the theme for the story \\"One For The Road\\" by Pat Dennis (Page 79). \\"Jenkin's Service Station specialized in fixing unnecessary repairs on RV's driven by seniors.\\" Two can play that game.<br /><br /> Then there is \\"Port-O-Prince\\" by R. J. Mills, (page 102) where the ultimate resting place for the recently deceased is a unique place. Sometimes your coworkers know you better than you know yourself.<br /><br /> Also included in this very enjoyable anthology are stories by R. T. Lawton, Thomas Bray, Terry Burlison, Michael Giorgio, Nick Andreychuk, Mike Befeler, Peggy Jaegly, Stephen D. Rogers, Michael Learmond, Kevin Carollo, David Dumitru, Beverle Graves Myers, Jeremy Yoder, James C. Wardlaw, Donna Sundblad, Sandra Levy Ceren, Lori G. Armstrong, A. S. Berman, Lance Zarimba, Joan Hall Hovey, and Dean Johnson. While I did not go into detail about their stories, that should not be construed as a negative reflection on their work. Far from it as there is not a bad story in this 190-page anthology. It is all good.<br /><br /> As noted on the back cover, \\"Twenty-five mystery stories of crimes and bathroom ranging from zany to deadly serious, by some of today's finest short story writers.\\" That pretty much sums it up and makes this book well worth reading. Whether you read in the bathroom or not, remember, please leave the fan on.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Who Died In Here?<br /><br />By Pat Dennis<br /><br />Penury Press<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2004<br /><br />ISBN # 0-9676344-2-3<br /><br />Large Trade Paperback<br /><br />$12.95 US<br /><br />Kevin R.

According to the park's cheerful mascot, Wally the Wallaby, the park is \\"'The most fun place in the universe.'\\" (Page 13) For Joe, the elderly inventor who creates many of the robots in the park, it isn't the most fun place in the universe anymore. For five years he has worked on \\"The Garden Of Fairy Tales\\" project where his beautiful robots would bring to life children's stories such as Cinderella, Snow White, Pinocchio and others.<br /><br />But now his boss, Mr. Fox and his assistant, Miss Kat in the mode of corporate bean counters everywhere have mandated that Joe stop work on the fairy tale project. They claim no one cares about that sort of thing anymore. Instead, after threatening Joe with termination, they insist that he work on the new \\"Roboboxers\\" project. The robots violently fight it out while audience response is measured by computer and whichever robot the audience prefers, the computer makes sure that robot wins the fight. Mr. Fox ignores Joe's concerns over violence and the history of the park as he embraces his violent version of the future.<br /><br />Disheartened and faced with repeated threats of being fired, Joe has no choice but to comply with the order to dismantle the robots and move onto constructing new robots for the project. But, the idea appalls him and he decided to finish his favorite robot, Robonocchio which is his version of Pinocchio. Working late into the night he finishes and realizes that this might be the best robot he has ever created. Exhausted, he falls into a deep sleep and manages to miss it when, thanks to a little offworld help, Robonocchio comes to life. Much like his namesake, he has a nose for trouble and one that gives him away when he lies.<br /><br />The basic story is very entertaining and appeals well to its intended audience of young adults. It also appeals to the younger crowd and adults will especially enjoy the subtle social commentary that appears from time to time throughout the book.

With his new struggling business open less than six months and all records destroyed in the fire along with everything else he owns, Hannibal is devastated and contemplating a bleak future. Thanks to Cindy Santiago, daughter of his friend, Ray Santiago, he may get a new place fast.<br /><br />Cindy works in a small law firm and one of the partners, Mr. Dan Baylor, has recently branched out into real estate as a developer. Cindy is sure that she can set up a meeting and Mr. Baylor will help Hannibal get a new place. They do meet and after Baylor checks with his staff, he informs Hannibal that nothing is currently available. The only possible exception and one that he is very reluctant to reveal, is in a building across the river in Anacostia. Infested with squatters and drug dealers, Mr. Baylor has been unable to get them out of his building despite repeated requests to the Police. The property, which he bought from the government and is intended to be developed for low-income housing, is costing Baylor every month and thanks to the squatters and drug dealers, he can't recoup his investment.<br /><br />A deal is struck for Hannibal to clean out the building and provide security so that repair crews can go to work. Former government agent and now \\"troubleshooter\\" Hannibal Jones figures he has the bases covered and can have the building emptied permanently in less than a week. But, he is very wrong and quickly puts himself and those he cares about in great danger as the war for control between a neighborhood and the mob heats up.<br /><br />Unlike the earlier two novels of the series, this novel is more of a character study and less a mystery. Little detective work is actually done since the dealers and other bad guys are quickly identified. As such, this novel shifts more into a vigilante style of justice work with Hannibal forced to repeatedly do battle at considerable cost to clear the building. Over the course of the siege, not only do we see how Hannibal came into being through insights into his character but we also see the beginnings of the romance between himself and Cindy Santiago. Several other recurring characters from the other novels make their introduction as well, explaining the tight bonds that exist.<br /><br />Like the others in this series, this very enjoyable novel features tight writing, plenty of action, and intriguing characters. However, in so doing, some reviewers have mistakenly compared this author with Tom Clancy. Please do not be misled as this book and the others in the series have nothing in common with Tom Clancy novels. Both authors are writing books that do not share connections of style, character development, plotting, pacing, or anything else in common other than the fact they both release books printed on paper. Since Tom Clancy writes detailed techno thrillers making such comparisons meaningless and absurd, a better comparison might be made between Hannibal Jones to the \\"Lucas Davenport\\" character of the Prey series by John Sandford if comparisons must be made. Much like Lucas, Hannibal is an intense loner by his very nature and is very selective in his personal entanglements, romantic or otherwise. Much like Lucas, Hannibal does not tolerate evil in its many forms and is often conflicted as to the results and consequences regarding such confrontations. Much like Lucas, Hannibal is often pitted against forces that devalue human life at great personal cost.<br /><br />Hannibal is fast becoming an old friend that this reader regularly looks forward to every time a new novel is released.

Not just disrupting lives with minor inconveniences but the computers can actually kill. That is the backdrop theme to this soon to be released adventure/disaster style read from author Daniel J. Ronco.<br /><br />The computer system in this case is the Atlas Operating System, which is almost universally used in the very near future. Created by Ray Brown and his team from Vantage Point Software, the product has beaten all competitors. So much so, the company was a target of an anti-trust trial. A trial they ultimately lost and as a result the company was broken up into theoretically separate units. But despite the breakup, the company is still hers and under her control and beautiful CEO Dianne Morgan has plans. Dianne is charming, sexually confident and aggressive, ruthless and relentless in her obsession to destroy the competition, the government, and anyone else who stupidly stands in her way.<br /><br />The lovely Dianne has two motives. Not only does she want her company to succeed, but she also wants her shadowy group within and without her company known as \\"The Domain\\" to succeed in their plans to take over the world. To do so, they will unleash a virus lurking deep within the operating system. The virus will cause a systematic shutdown of everything everywhere until her goals are met.<br /><br />The virus's name is \\"Peacemaker\\" in reference to her vision of the future under her control. But Ray Brown has discovered a form of the virus and has seen in it violent action. He intends to stop it. Initially not realizing that his lover CEO Dianne Morgan is behind it all, he sets out to destroy \\"Peacemaker\\" and can only watch as the evolving and possibly self aware virus not only defeats his every attempt but others are retaliated against for his actions. And while Dianne plots to take over the world she has yet to understand that others within her group plot to oust her and use \\"Peacemaker\\" for their own nefarious purposes.<br /><br />With at least three major storylines, this book shifts constantly in third person between them in this adventure/disaster style novel. As such, character development is rather limited and somewhat stereotypical of the genre. For example, Ray Brown is portrayed as a brilliant alcoholic constantly at war with his inner demon need for a stiff drink while the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Then there is the achingly beautiful Dianne Morgan who reminds one of a figure from Greek tragedy. Not only will she sleep with any man necessary to get her way, while at the pinnacle of success, she throws it all away on a quest for yet more power. And of course, what would any adventure/disaster read be without the pov of various minor characters doomed by the actions of the \\"Peacemaker\\" virus. Some will live, some will die and some of those deaths will be horrible as chaos ensues and society collapses.<br /><br />Having said all that, for what it is in the genre, this is a pretty good book. Unlike many such novels, the focus isn't so much on the fate of the characters, but more a commentary on society, current and future, as a whole. With allusions to recent computer trials in the news, at least in the mind of this reviewer, this novel serves more as a dire warning of a future we may unwittingly be creating each day as we turn more and more control of our lives over to computer systems.  While the read is enjoyable and fast, the issues this novel raises deserve serious consideration before the next power blackout or other disaster-man made or otherwise.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Peacemaker<br /><br />By Daniel J.

Lewis recently met Jon Ericson as Jon was walking on the beach below Lewis' seaside home. Jon was looking for Viking coins and other artifacts that would prove his controversial theory that the Vikings arrived in New Hampshire and vicinity long before European explorers and settlers. The two men over a short period of time became good friends.<br /><br />So it was only natural that Jon, when he found proof of his theory, called Lewis with the news. Unfortunately, Lewis wasn't home and missed the call recorded by his home answering machine. When Lewis returned and heard the message he attempted to call Jon back and only got a busy signal. With a sense of excitement he headed over to Jon's house only to find an active crime scene. It was clearly a homicide and Jon was dead. Despite being warned off the case by his old friend and Police Detective, Diane Woods, he begins to work the case. In so doing, he learns more about himself than he ever expected as well as how far people will go to keep intact a certain way of history.<br /><br />While introspective at numerous times through out the 258-page novel, this time out Lewis Cole is more active and more of a cold vigilante than we have seen in the past four novels.  Diane, as mentioned above, is back again with a further complication in her life as well as the contradictory and complex character Felix Tinios. But front and center and clearly more so than the past books is Lewis Cole and his sense of justice.<br /><br />Lewis always had a strong sense of justice. But as each novel moves forward from the nightmare of his past, he has been more and more wiling to use whatever means are necessary to accomplish his task.

But, getting my hands on a copy wasn't easy for a number of reasons. Finally, I got one and I wasn't disappointed in this hard hitting anthology featuring private Investigator Nathaniel Rose.<br /><br />The 103-page book is made up of seven complex stories involving Nathaniel Rose and a recurring cast of characters over a significant period of time. In almost every case, the women are sexy, the violence is hard hitting, and Rose gets the crook by any means necessary.<br /><br />The book opens with the story \\"Partners\\" where Rose is nearly killed when his Mustang explodes. He survives and with little idea who wanted him dead, starts looking.<br /><br />\\"Fair Warning\\" follows and is a case involving a missing husband, fast food, and a tantalizing wife.<br /><br />\\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" comes next in the book as well as in the book arc in terms of character development and time, and involves a missing fianc&eacute;e. Simply making photocopies can get one killed it seems.<br /><br />\\"Lucky Seven\\" is another aptly named story. In this case, seven witnesses can all detail for court how they saw a man kill his wife and her lover. The client just needs to know how good the case is, which on the surface, seems simple enough.<br /><br />\\"Even Roses Bleed\\" revolves around a beautiful woman and her need to have her husband dead. Word on the street is Nathaniel Rose would fit the bill nicely, in more ways than one.<br /><br />Strippers have always been a hallmark in detective fiction but rarely used to such good effect in \\"Tequila Sunrise and the Horse.\\"<br /><br />But after all, for any P.I. the cases are \\"Only Business.\\" Something to remember in the sometimes stormy waters of love.<br /><br />With an overall story arc linking the stories in this anthology and providing character development, this book is a very good read and more complex than many novels. The writing style is terse and hard hitting and usually in dialogue form. At the same time, scene descriptions come alive for the reader who will quickly become lost in the murky world of \\"Bullets, Booze and Broads.\\"<br /><br />Book Facts<br /><br />Tequila Sunrise<br /><br />Hardboiled P.I Nathaniel Rose: Bullets, Booze and Broads<br /><br />By Michael Bracken<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Wildside Press<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2000<br /><br />ISBN # 1-58715-252-5<br /><br />Large Trade Paperbackand more complex than many novels.

Pride, Colorado. The focus of this novel, primarily, is the tragic hero Charles Monroe Sutton who never fit into his family and was well aware that he was unwanted by his father.<br /><br />\\"Cut from a different pattern, longhaired, urchin looking, free spirited Charley was nothing like his clean-cut, studious, white collar seeking brothers. From the days when they first learned to read, Abe and Bill seemed to always have their noses buried in books. Charley, on the other hand, could not sit still long enough to read but a few paragraphs of any written words. He was too active and too curious about living life, not reading about it.\\" (Page 5)<br /><br />Instead, he jumps off the roof of their shed thinking he can fly with the aid of a bed sheet. It doesn't work but Charley is undeterred. In fact, it becomes a challenge for him and he begins early in his young life to do more and more dangerous stunts. A situation made worse by his mother's decision to abandon her abusive husband and three sons leaving, Charley, the youngest by several years, for all intents and purposes alone in the world with a pseudo family that doesn't care about him at all.<br /><br />Charley's love of danger as he grows up eventually leads him into a highly successful career as a stuntman. Known by his nickname of \\"fearless\\" his services are in high demand and Charley is making money fast and spending it just as fast in a lavish lifestyle. While in a bar during a movie shoot, he meets and befriends the bartender, Ann Tailor. He falls hard for her and for approximately a year they live together in California. That is, until her own painful childhood past coupled with her need for wealth and revenge causes her to leave him.<br /><br />Her leaving devastates Charley and rekindles his intense feelings of abandonment. His work performance suffers, his gambling increases causing him to lose large amounts of money, and he is spiraling down out of control. Before long, he suffers another devastation in the form of a career ending back injury. In massive debt to the Vegas mob and with little left but the clothes on his back after a failed suicide attempt, he has little choice several months later when Ann calls to offer him a job as a chauffer.<br /><br />He accepts the job out of desperation despite strong misgivings about being in Ann's presence as he still loves her depite her many flaws. Soon, he is living very well in Mt. Pride, Colorado on the estate and is performing his job as chauffer for Ann and her husband, Allen Clifford Eckard. By marrying the wealthy businessman son of the wealthy Mayor, Ann is doing very well financially. But, like Charley, no matter how good the current standard of living is, it isn't enough. Believing she is smarter than anyone around her as well as driven by her own history of abuse, she seeks revenge no matter the cost. Slowly, she seduces Charley into resuming their physical relationship as well as into her plot for revenge. However, the husband has plans of his own for his lovely wife. As people begin to vanish, Colorado Homicide Detectives Joe Warner and Eddy Konklin are brought in to work the case and untangle the webs of deceit, revenge and betrayal.<br /><br />This third novel in the series features brief allusions to the earlier books but like them could be read and enjoyed as a stand-alone novel. While the dialogue occasionally seems a bit off and the author has taken liberties with the facts concerning a certain National Park, the overall novel is very enjoyable. This novel is more streamlined than the previous two and therefore moves forward at a significantly faster pace with less switches in points of view evidenced in the earlier books while retaining lots of character development. This could be due to the efforts of several editors or the fact that Kam wrote this novel solo. Regardless, this368-page novel is an enjoyable read full of twists and turns with a final left hook punch to the reader at the very end.o.

Man, when I was a kid, we all wanted to be Muddy Waters. The way he sang about women and whiskey. Made me want to play that ole blues.'\\"<br /><br />\\"'Not much has changed,' I said.\\"<br /><br />\\"'Except plenty,\\" he said. \\"That music is against God. Makes thugs into heroes, women into things, and money above all.'\\" (Page 119)<br /><br />Nick Travers's old friend JoJo doesn't think much of rap music. Neither does Nick but that doesn't stop him from helping his friend and ex New Orleans Saints football teammate Teddy Paris. Teddy has a major problem and will be dead within twenty-four hours if Nick doesn't help. Nick has a history of being able to find things and in this fourth novel (Crossroad Blues, Leavin' Trunk Blues, Dark End of the Street) of the series; he may have finally used up all of his luck.<br /><br />Teddy Paris has a rap star prodigy working for his label, Ninth Ward Records. As the age of 16, the young star goes by the name of ALIAS. While he might be street wise, he was set up and conned out of more than $700,000. With his company already on the edge of financial collapse, Teddy needs that money back to pay off a cross-town rival who wants ALIAS and his money making income for himself. Teddy is trying desperately to keep ALIAS out of his competitors clutches for business and personal reasons and is also trying to stay alive as the rival has threatened death if he doesn't get his money. So, Teddy needs Nick, who has a few ideas to find and recover the missing money.<br /><br />Nick has done this sort of thing before by tracking down missing royalty money for some of the old blues singers and this is fairly close to doing that. But normally, he hasn't had this kind of deadline and with no one else to help, Nick never thinks twice but jumps into the mess with both feet. There isn't anything he won't do to help his former teammate and his immediate goal is to buy a little time. He starts looking for the players who took the money along with the reluctant ALIAS. Before long, as secrets are exposed, the trail twists and turns in violent and unexpected ways with the hunters becoming the hunted before a final violent confrontation in speedboats out on Lake Pontchartrain.<br /><br />As always, Ace Atkins spins a dark tale of greed and murder in and around New Orleans and the Deep South. Unlike James Lee Burke who has written about the same areas, Ace Atkins never sways the reader's focus away from the ugliness by pretty prose concerning flowers, the skies above, or the muddy waters. One isn't given a respite in Atkins' books, as once he draws you into the muck and mire of the human soul, he does not let you go before the last dark page.<br /><br />The world Nick Travers inhabits while rooted firmly in the present constantly reminds one of the past especially in regards to the music of the blues. Throughout the series, the blues has been a constant companion, if not a character into its own right, and that is true in this novel as well. Through well placed snippets of information, the author and his signature character remind the reader that the rap of today, in all its forms, was built on the back of the blues.<br /><br />While JoJo and his wife Loretta and a few select others make another reappearance, one gets the feeling that this every well might be the final Nick Travers mystery. A story arc branching across four novels is complete, some loose ends are tied off and by the end, Nick has finally dealt with old ghosts that have bothered him throughout the series.

Konrath	Lieutenant Jacqueline \\"Jack\\" Daniels is having a rough time of it lately. Beyond the fact that it is a nasty October day in Chicago as the novel opens, the crime scene at a local 7-11 is a mess. They have a body of a white female, blonde, in her twenties with deep stab wounds and strangulation marks. She was found face down in the trash receptacle with a note stapled to her chest that taunts the Police and identifies the killer as \\"the Gingerbread Man.\\" As the freezing rain continues to fall and the media arrives, it becomes clear that the witnesses didn't see anything that will help.<br /><br />The investigation begins and soon seems to stall which does nothing to ease Jack's chronic insomnia. Late night shopping binges via cable and credit card only make her feel worse as does the fact that her live in boyfriend dumped her in favor of his personal trainer, Roxy. Then there is the fact that the case quickly turns in to a media circus and the arrival of a pair of humorless profilers from the FBI does nothing to help. The situation quickly escalates and before long as he tauntingly kills again, the killer sets his target on Jack as his final victim. Everything is falling apart and Jack is doing everything she can to find a killer bent on finishing his work with her death.<br /><br />Shifting in point of view from Jack to the serial killer and back again, the novel rapidly moves forward in what is hopefully a start to a series. The action is fast paced and Jack Daniels with all her quirks is a very appealing character as are many of the secondary, in name only, characters. Unlike many serial killer books, not only is the focus often elsewhere other than the case, there are many laugh out loud sections that can slip by if the reader isn't paying attention. In short, this is a wonderful novel mixing the best elements of what the genre has to offer and the rare chance to get in on the ground floor with an author that should be on the bestseller list before too long.<br /> <br />	2004-09-11

Maurice Leblanc made the fictional character famous in a series of short stories and novels just after the turn of the century approximately 100 years ago. Arse'ne Lupin, in a sense, was France's answer to the exploits of the legendary Sherlock Holmes. Various meetings between the men on opposite sides make up the two short stories and the novel The Hollow Needle\\" found in this book.<br /><br />\\"The Hollow Needle\\" opens with Raymonde de Saint-Ve'ran being awoken by sounds of intruders below her room in the country castle. She discovers they are being robbed and with the Count unconscious, takes matters into her own capable hands. As the last person flees away from her home, she manages to shoot and wound him at long range. The intruder goes down, and then begins to crawl away as she goes downstairs to begin the pursuit. Once outside she quickly goes to the point where she last saw him and discovers that he has vanished. A search of the grounds and surrounding farmland is commenced by the servants with no success and by dawn the gendarmes are called in.<br /><br />An investigation is launched by the local magistrate and numerous clues are discovered. Also found is a note threatening the young woman's life if she has managed to fatally wound the boss. The media, in the form of two young reporters, is allowed total and complete access to the case and every detail discovered. It quickly becomes apparent that one of the reporters isn't a reporter after all. Instead, he is a young high school student who is using the situation as a learning experience. Isidore Beautrelet is his name and he quickly puts together several of the clues leading the investigation towards Lupin and his gang. What follows is a cat and mouse game as Isidore, with Sherlock not available due to being kidnapped, leads the investigation on behalf of the authorities in a pursuit of Lupin. Lupin, master of disguises and plans, constantly eludes the authorities and Isidore while a fascinated nation watches and reads all about it in the papers.<br /><br />Also present in this first volume is the short story \\"Sherlock Holmes Arrives Too Late.\\" Originally written in 1906, it features the first clash between Sherlock and Lupin. The book is concluded with a short story entitled \\"Escape Not The Thunderbolt\\" which is an original story penned by Jean-marc and Randy Lofficier for this volume. In it, by following the writing style of Maurice Leblanc, they bring several story threads from \\"The Hollow Needle\\" together to provide a conclusion to the rather open ended read.<br /><br />Unlike many mystery novels today, this novel does not feature gratuitous and graphic descriptive violence. While there are violent moments, they are limited and are used to move the story forward on a new track. Instead, what drives the novel forward is the mental process where deduction and reasoning are used to solve an ever-changing puzzle thanks to the constant efforts of Lupin. His answer is not to kill the pursuers and others that are witnesses. Instead, his answer is to publicly celebrate the chase, his ability to elude, and his ability to plant new false clues for Isidore and the authorities to chase. In this case, all trails eventually lead to the revelation of \\"The Hollow Needle\\" and its legendary secret involving the Kings of France.<br /><br />While Sherlock Holmes rarely makes an appearance in the novel, the novel and accompanying short stories provide a highly entertaining read.  The book as a whole combines a strong mystery, a villain that is so dastardly he becomes likeable, and protagonist in Isidore worthy of Sherlock. In the end, Beautrelet proves that two can play at this game and win.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Arse'ne Lupin VS.

Computer technology that was so sophisticated, it could and did kill under the noses of the operators. The same idea is behind the latest book, \\"Death Match.\\"<br /><br />In this case, the sophisticated computer technology is at work in \\"Eden, Incorporated.\\" For a $25,000 application fee Eden, Incorporated will provide the ultimate in match making services. An incredibly secretive company led by the reclusive Richard Silver, nobody outside the company knows how it works, but it does as literally tens of thousands of people can attest from all walks of life and all races. In some cases, six to be exact, the system has found the ultimate perfect match where couples were 100 compatible in every single testing point.<br /><br />Those 100 perfect matches are known at Eden as the \\"super couples.\\" One such super couple was Lewis and Lindsey Thorne. They were the first perfect match and like all the Eden clients followed extensively after the match to make sure everything was fine. By all appearances and testing criteria everything was fine. That is until both were found dead in what appeared to be a double suicide leaving their infant baby daughter alone in the world. Dr. Christopher Lash, once a forensic psychologist with the FBI with an impressive track record, both positive and negative, is brought in to provide a quick impartial investigation to determine what went wrong and if Eden's extensive profiling and tracking systems failed.<br /><br />His access is limited at first and Dr. Lash is unable to find anything. His frustration is compounded by his slow realization that this case is so similar to the events of three years ago that ultimately destroyed his family, his FBI career and nearly took his life. Unable to explain why the first couple died, he pushes for and is finally granted full access on the news that a second super couple has died, also victims of what appeared to be a double suicide.<br /><br />As Lash delves deep into the hidden world of Eden, Inc., he discovers that everything is not nearly as perfect as they would have the public believe. While the technology is advanced, it is built on the mind of man and every person has flaws hidden deep below the surface. On the hunt for a killer, he is slow to realize that his past can be exploited by a killer who believes Lash is a target that must be stopped before the secrets are uncovered.  Anything, no matter what, when cornered will fight back which is something Dr. Lash never considered to his own peril.<br /><br />Much like \\"Utopia,\\" this novel is primarily an action adventure read with a constant viewpoint that technology is limited by the vision of the humans that create it. The characters are somewhat stereotypical and remind the reader heavily of those who populated \\"Utopia.\\" Again, there is the reclusive genius, the hard edged security chief who means well and has absolute loyalty to the reclusive genius, and the deeply troubled outside expert brought into research the problem. Then there is the clear and very obvious nod to a certain episode of the original Star Trek, intentional or otherwise, which to divulge more would ruin the book.<br /><br />At the same time, despite its limitations, this is another fast and fun read through the 356 pages. While the secondary storyline is weak and should have been given a little more depth and instead is barely noticed through much of the novel, the overall read keeps the reader heavily engrossed in the twisting chase.

But financially and emotionally supporting them just got harder as Claire has suddenly been fired from her job by Vernon Carter. Emotionally and physically exhausted on her arrival at home, the last thing she wants to do is go back out to the store for some sugar. Instead, she goes next door where the new neighbors have moved in to borrow a cup of sugar. She finds a woman barely alive, shot on the chest, in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor.<br /><br />As the woman dies, she gasps out a few apparently meaningless words. Then Claire is grabbed by a man who asks, \\"who sent you?\\" Stunned and shocked by what she has seen, she has no idea of what he is talking about or what has happened. He flees the house and takes the unwilling Claire with him promising to kill her if she does not cooperate. They leave as the house explodes behind them. He believes she was sent to kill him and only managed to kill his handler. Despite her protests of innocence to the contrary, he forces her to drive the getaway car and go on the run with him.<br /><br />What follows is a twisting tale of political corruption and ruthless killers as Claire and the stranger go on the run. As in other novels I have had the pleasure to read from this author, romance is a major component of the work. However, in this case, the mystery component is also paramount as the chase ensues and the two become united to survive as well as to solve the mystery.  Slowly, as they hide on the run from those that want them dead, they learn of each other's backgrounds as well as developing a romantic relationship that may survive beyond the events depicted in this book. Along with character development and humor, this book is another fine novel by Irene Estep and not an easy one to put down.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Silence Knight<br /><br />By Irene Estep<br /><br />LTDBooks<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2002<br /><br />ISBN # 1-55316-085-1<br /><br />Variety of Formatsr />ISBN # 1-55316-085-1 <br />Variety of Formats <br />	2004-07-31

Moe is married and has a baby girl as well as a ton of guilt over not telling his wife everything about her father and the truth about her brother's disappearance.  His knee still aches and while he may be the only Jewish licensed P.I. in New York City, he hasn't used his license once since that case. Instead, the wine shop in which he is a partner with his brother has opened and he spends his days advising customers and trying to reconcile his past.<br /><br />That is until, by all appearances, a homeless man appears in the shop. He carries with him some of Moe Prager's press clippings as a result of a missing child case covered in the first book as well as the missing person case of three years ago. Moe repeatedly tells the man that he can't help him and the man begs for help anyway. The man explains he is Arthur Rosen, and he wants help for his sister, Karen Rosen, who Moe allegedly went to school with years ago.<br /><br />The name doesn't ring any bells and still doesn't when R. B. Carter shows up in his limo and tries to convince Moe to stay uninvolved. She, along with many others, allegedly died in a famous fire at a resort up in the Catskills years ago and R. B. Carter doesn't want the case looked into by Moe for any reason. He paints a picture of Arthur being insane with grief and delusional and then gets out his checkbook and tries to buy Moe off. Insulted and bored with his working life, Moe begins to dig into the case. Before long, he is further motivated to keep digging by guilt over the sudden suicide of her brother as well as the fact that he finally remembers how he loved her from afar those years ago. Getting free from his wine shop obligations as Christmas approaches in 1981, he makes a pilgrimage deep into the Catskill Mountains to see for himself where she died. Once there, guilt won't let him leave and he begin to realize the sheer depravity of some outcasts from society. As Moe works the case and realizes who the killer was, he finds new evidence that makes him wonder if Karen Rosen is really dead or just living a lie as he is?<br /><br />As in the first book, the theme of guilt and religious atonement waves heavily on the work. But unlike the first book, in this case, the read is almost crushed from it. Both themes are dealt with all the subtly of a sledgehammer and as such comes across as extremely heavy handed. This is a very slow moving book and much of it has a feel of cathartic release of some type.<br /><br />At the same time, the author continues to develop the Moe Prager character and the actual case and its ramifications are well worth the read and interesting. While the probable killer is obvious fairly early on, not everything is apparent and there are several twists and turns and turns to keep the reader involved in this slow moving book. Those who are interested could read this book as a stand alone, as virtually everything that happened in the first book is covered heavily in this book as well.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Redemption Street (A Moe Prager Mystery)<br /><br />By Reed Farrel Coleman<br /><br />Viking<br /><br />2004<br /><br />ISBN # 0-670-03291-3<br /><br />Hardbackon't let him leave and he begin to realize the sheer depravity of some outcasts from society.

With each passing day, tomorrow suddenly became yesterday.\\" (Page 470)<br /><br />The above quote comes from deep within this detailed and interesting novel. Not only does it sum up the story to that point, it actually also sums up this novel which, despite the title, is not a sequel to the first novel \\"Have No Mercy.\\" However, like the namesake, this novel features detailed characters and the tragic results of years of deceit, ignorance and greed.<br /><br />There are two primary storylines in this 561-page novel and for the most part, each exists independent of the other until the twisting, shocking conclusion. One storyline involves Mama and her daughter known as \\"Farm Girl.\\" Educationally and financially impoverished, they drift from place to place on Mama's whim as she does farm chores in exchange for food, a place to sleep, and a little money. They wind up on the Welk farm and end up staying for far longer than they planned as an emotional bond is made between them and the elderly Jefferson Welk.<br /><br />\\"For Mama there was an instant bond with Jefferson. Quite unlike most of the farmers treated her in the past, Jefferson didn't talk down to her, like he was better than she was. His gentle way of speaking was comforting. She could find no argument in doing household tasks and cooking, or in finally teaching her daughter how to manage inside domestic chores.\\" (Page 17)<br /><br />The other storyline involves Darrin George Righter who lives with his much older brother, Frank, on the family farm in rural Nebraska. As a teenager, Darin caused problems and didn't seem to have inherited Frank's love for the farm, work ethic, or ability to act responsibly. After graduating from College, a lack of resources and a lack of employment forced Darin back to the family farm he hated so much.<br /><br />\\"For a short time, unemployed Darin was either out and about town, drinking and carousing, or sitting around the house drinking beer and smoking cigarettes. He never bothered to lift a hand to help Frank. Easy going Frank didn't mind. Money was never an issue.\\" (Page 27)<br /><br />Eventually, Darrin gets a job at a local bank and before long hatches a devious plan to begin stealing from bank customers. At roughly the same time, Jefferson begins to teach Farm Girl the basics as best as he can while they all become closer and closer. As months pass, Darin temporarily crosses paths with Jefferson and Farm Girl, setting into motion further tragic events, before his own storyline splits off again.<br /><br />As in \\"Have No Mercy,\\" these characters and their actions are described in exhausting detail. Along with finding the occasional typos, a good editor would have been able to streamline this every expansive work somewhat by cutting down some of the dialogue, back story and overall details. Many areas of this novel could have been cut considerably without altering the overall story.<br /><br />However, while it is excessively wordy, the overall story is complex, interesting, and keeps the reader involved. Things and events are planned out very well and fully described as the novel moves very slowly forward. There is a logical progression both in terms of character development as well as in the storyline and all questions are answered. Nothing is left hanging and open to reader interpretation as everything is fully and completely explained.  The reader is left with an interesting and complex as well as overall enjoyable tale full of deceit and greed along with the usual warning from mother's everywhere-be careful what you wish for.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Black Rosebud: Have No Mercy II<br /><br />By Bobby and Kam Ruble<br /><br />Global Authors Publications<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />2003<br /><br />ISBN # 0-97285131-3<br /><br />Large Trade Paperbackas either out and about town, drinking and carousing, or sitting around the house drinking beer and smoking cigarettes.

She wants and needs her planned vacation at Sanibel Island, Florida and nothing is going to stop her. Her boss, Captain Frank Marks eventually agrees and she begins her much needed vacation.<br /><br />She soon arrives on the Island after attending a wedding reception only to find that her former lover, Connor Brenningan and his daughter, Joani are also there. Joani has manipulated the situation in an effort to play matchmaker, as she realizes what the adults do not, that they still love each other and should be together.<br /><br />Joani isn't the only one attempting to manipulate the situation. Also on the island are DEA agents operating undercover who are very familiar to Maureen. She soon learns that Connor is a subject of surveillance as well as investigation. There is concern within the DEA that Connor while working on a series of articles on the Columbian Drug Cartel may have accepted payment to withhold information and may have had a role in the death of a source valuable to the DEA. Adding to the mystery, a contract on his life is rumored.<br /><br />As a reporter, Connor has ticked off quite a few people over the years and the DEA investigators don't know who ordered the hit or why or even if it is for real. They don't trust Connor and because of his past relationship with Marleen, want her to be the perfect undercover person and keep an eye on him. Marleen can either help investigate Connor or be removed far away from the action and kept out of the investigation until everything is resolved one way or another. Marleen agrees to help, having no real choice, and the investigation begins. Against a backdrop of occasional violence, the seduction begins as well as Connor and Marleen dance around each other trying to deny the passion that naturally arises between them.<br /><br />While I do not have a lot of experience reading and reviewing romance novels, this author remains a pleasure to read. As in an earlier novel of this series I read, this work, while primarily a romance read, also encapsulates a strong mystery component, interesting characters, and tight writing. While the romance is a major element, it does not deter or detract from the mystery and in fact, enhances it. These characters come alive for the reader and not a word is wasted in the telling of the tale.<br /><br />In short, by combining elements of romance and mystery as well as hallmarks of any strong writing---interesting and complex characters, vivid setting descriptions, and story plotting---the result is a very good read regardless of the genre.r remains a pleasure to read.

An outcast returned with a group of cutthroats to rape and pillage the settlement before killing all. In modern times, Moloch, as he restlessly sleeps in a Virginia prison cell dreams of the massacre as if he were there.<br /><br />On modern day Sanctuary, now known as \\"Dutch\\" Officer Joe Dupree senses something is not right with his island home. At seven feet two inches and known to the residents affectionately as \\"Melancholy Joe\\" he is the island's resident policeman and is assisted by a rotation of officers from the coastal city of Portland, Maine. Dupree knows the legends and the history of the island and he knows that something is wrong. Something is stirring on the island having been awakened from its long slumber.<br /><br />Joe isn't the only one on the island sensing something. Vincent \\"Jack\\" Giacomelli is aware also. As the island's landscape painter, he isn't very good but he does make money selling to the tourists. He spins a tale about his past as well for the tourists and soon another painting is sold. But his paintings are changing and he isn't aware of the changes until the painting is finished. Small black shapes are appearing in the paintings. Small black shapes that he did not paint and almost look human.<br /><br />There are other signs as well. The birds are gone, the marsh in the center of the island at the massacre site is rapidly expanding and vegetation is growing even in the dead of winter, and the animals are acting strange. Then there are the moths that are appearing. Hundreds of them are appearing, sometimes a solitary moth, sometimes large clouds of them, even though it is the middle of winter and these kind of moths never appear on the island.  The signs of something strange continue to accumulate while Moloch escapes and leads a group of hardened evil men in search of his ex-wife, a child he cares nothing about and more than $800,000 of his money.<br /><br />Like the blizzard that is bearing down on the small island, Moloch and his men bear down on the island leaving a trail of torture and executions in their wake. They seek vengeance and retribution while also seeking the pleasure they derive from inflicting pain and death on others. They are led by a man, Moloch, whose reality slips more and more back to 1683 than in the present. They aren't the only ones seeking vengeance however. So too is the presence on the island as the blood debt from 1863 must once again be repaid.<br /><br />Blending themes of fate/destiny and the nature of pure evil, the author has created an intense read that highly entertains for the nearly 400-page novel. The work moves back and forth from supernatural events to the mystery components and along the way numerous characters are killed. Often very graphically and in very violent ways. As such, the read is intense, dark, and very disturbing at times.<br /><br />At the same time, watching the slow psychological collapse of several of the characters was interesting. As were the ways the author weaved the many storylines and character viewpoints in such a way to draw the reader in all the while suggesting a possible rational explanation for events. This is a book that crosses genres between horror and mystery and for those readers so inclined, a very good book.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />Bad Men<br /><br />By John Connolly<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Atria Books<br /><br />2004<br /><br />ISBN # 0-7434-8784-2<br /><br />Hardback/> <br />Like the blizzard that is bearing down on the small island, Moloch and his men bear down on the island leaving a trail of torture and executions in their wake.

Novak	Years after the great population wars on the planet Daleer, what little hospitable land that is left is supporting the two groups known as Gemen and Arath. Mutual hatred, much of it based on false knowledge handed down over the generations, ensures that almost any meeting between the parties turns into bloodshed. As this romantic fantasy novel opens, Princess Arath, known as Calli, is being sent to Viceroy Roman and his family in preparation for a wedding. Calli is to be married to him should he find her acceptable and per her father, King Arath, he will find her acceptable and she better do nothing to cause any problems. She does not want to marry him and knows that her father will brook no interference by her or anyone under his control regarding this arranged political marriage.<br /><br />What he can't control are the Shadrani, led by Prince Gemen, who hunt in the forests around Soris, the town of Calli and her family. Legend has it that according to the handmaiden Solte, \\"'They are not like any other! They cannot be killed. And they--they howl at the moon like crazed beasts!'\\" (Page 4) The handmaiden goes on to recount stories that both are familiar with that the Shadrani drink the blood of their victims and have strange sexual practices.<br /><br />Calli dismisses these stories and others as tales told to frighten young children into behaving. Before long, she acts like a child herself and decided it would be a good idea to change clothes with the handmaiden. Thanks to the requirement that females must be veiled at all times due to their second-class status, the royal guard with them is unaware that they have switched places. The guard is also completely unaware that the Shadrani are stalking the group and once attacked, are unable to rescue both women. Instead, they leave the Princess dressed in her handmaiden's clothes behind, secure in the knowledge as they flee with Solte, that they have protected the one that matters. The abandoned Calli quickly becomes a prisoner of Prince Gemen and his troops.<br /><br />As this novel moves forward, Calli moves from a position of a hated prisoner, to a person of trust by some of the Shadrani, to the potential mother of the future King of the Shadrani. At the same time, she works to conceal her noble birth to stay alive, she finds herself falling in love with the Prince. A man who has great personal motivation to kill her should he learn the truth.<br /><br />This is a novel that relies heavily on erotic elements, often very graphic elements, to move the story forward. While there are other storylines involving deceit and treachery among the houses and sub-groups, eroticism is the primary element and theme. As such, some scenes are extremely graphic and could offend readers who might be expecting a more mainstream and less graphic fantasy romance.<br /><br />While this was an interesting novel that kept the reader entertained and turning the pages, it is not a unique or exceptionally well written fantasy. Rather, much of the work reminds one of other fantasy novels and as such seems heavily clich&eacute;d. It reads as if the author is counting on the graphic nature of the work to make it stand out. If this is the first novel of a planned series as implied in the author's biography, it will be interesting to see if the author relies less on graphic eroticism and more on character development, storylines, and plotting in the future.<br /><br />Book Facts:<br /><br />The Prince Of Gemen<br /><br />By D.

Flush with Palmer's recent inheritance of three million dollars they have come to rest and recuperate before Palmer plays in a scheduled tennis tournament, the greater New Orleans Open, featuring the likes of John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors.<br /><br />Palmer is beginning to wonder how much longer he can keep playing, let alone keep the much younger Corky happy. And while the first week of vacation has been fun, the nights have been difficulty as dreams of doom and death haunt him. He doesn't know what the dreams mean anymore than he knows the meaning of what he saw on the balcony of a movie set as Corky and he passed quickly by on a streetcar. Unlike the dreams, that he could investigate and briefly did before Corky explained it away as the actor and the actress was rehearsing.<br /><br />Maybe they were and maybe they weren't. Troubled by his dreams of doom and death and what he witnessed, Palmer isn't looking forward to the interruption provided by Bliss, Corky's old friend. The beautiful Bliss arrives like a hurricane stampeding across Palmer and Corky's lives. Her arrival sets off a cascade of events involving wild sex, illicit drug use, and Mob involvement that ends in a shattering and very bloody climax beneath a full moon.<br /><br />While billed as a mystery there is virtually no mystery involved here at all and very little depth to any of the characters. These characters are known for what they are within a few pages, if not paragraphs, as each one is introduced. Both the Mob boss and the movie director seem to have come from central casting. Palmer is a troubled aging tennis pro, with a hip young and fun girlfriend and an ability to get into trouble no matter where he goes or what he does. Within the first fifty pages of the novel, the parameters of the situation are clearly defined and all that is left as they followed their scripted roles are a few details.<br /><br />Palmer's angst over the twilight of his career and his future relationship with the much younger Corky, while pushed heavily by the author, comes across as shallow as his studly activities, drug induced or not.  The character seems more like a caricature than an actual person to care about and as such, his own drama means little, as do the dramas of the other characters. While often told what to feel through lines in the text, this author does not jump that gap to make the reader actually feel or even care about these shallow characters.<br /><br />Any alleged story is pushed to the background by the rampant and very graphic sex scenes laced heavily throughout the 210-page novel. Wild sex is the primary theme aided at times by illicit and accidental drug use. Much of the sex is performed by women gone wild as their secret sexual fantasies come to life unleashed by the ingestion of the drug Rohypnol.<br /><br />What this novel is, instead of being a mystery, is a very graphic men's adventure read. The hero, often injured, is still a stud, the women are beautiful and amazingly willing (with or without drugs), the crime guys are Italian and do their typical Mob stuff. For what it really is, a fast paced simplistic storyline and read, it isn't bad.lowed their scripted roles are a few details.

At President Jack Rutledge's personal request, Agent Harvath moved from the Secret Service to a new position within the newly created \\"Office of International Investigative Assistance\\" which is part of the ever increasing Department of Homeland Security. The innocuous title hides the mission of the unit, which is to stop terrorists anywhere in the world by any means necessary. Harvath's old friend, mentor, and father figure Gary Lawlor, who was once the former Deputy Director of the FBI, is in charge of the Office. Now Lawlor has gone missing and Harvath is summoned back to Washington.<br />There is concern at the highest levels that Gary Lawlor has been a double agent, quite possibly for decades. The notion is unthinkable to Harvath because of the close bond they have shared in the wake of the death of Harvath's father years ago. However, as he is briefed, it becomes clear that everything he believed about Lawlor in the past has been a lie pushed forward by a cover image he needed on behalf of the United States Government. Now thanks to string of murders of other members of his intelligence team, several of which called Lawlor just before their deaths, those in charge believe he turned traitor years ago and has now fled. After telling Harvath the background on a \\"need to know\\" basis, they warn him off and instead he is supposed to sit back and wait for contact from Lawlor if and when it happens.<br />After everything he did in the first two novels, it should have been obvious to bosses, just like it is to the casual reader, that the last thing Harvath is going to do is sit back and wait. Harvath begins to work the case in an attempt to clear Lawlor's good name and unwittingly uncovers a Russian plot hatched during the last days of the Cold War. The plan is to return Russia to the ranks of the Super Powers and reduce America to a smoldering pile of nuclear contaminated rubble by way of backpack nuclear weapons in the hands of sleeper agents scattered throughout the country.<br />Relying more on character development, plotting, and believable scenarios, this novel is a great improvement over the caliber of writing seen in \\"Path Of The Assassin.\\" While working on the secondary storyline of the slowly developing romantic relationship between Harvath and Meg, the author manages to convey new background information on the Harvath character. Neither storyline gets in the way of the main complex plot that is almost Ludlum like in its complexity.<br />The storylines also do not get in the way of Brad Thor preaching about the value of Democracy as he sees it or the need for Patriotism. While both are laudable goals, at time the author wields a sledgehammer in regards to both topics. As such, especially towards the end as events build towards a climatic showdown at the National Cemetery in Washington, D.C., the events depicted are pushed to the side to lecture the reader. Such heavy handedness is unnecessary and detracts somewhat from what should be an exciting ending.<br />However, overall this is a read more on the level with his first effort \\"The Lions Of Lucerne\\" and a significant improvement over the second very shallow novel, \\"Path Of The Assassin.\\" Fortunately for readers new to this series, the author covers the events in the second novel in considerable detail thus sparing readers from wading through that novel. With background details quickly handled, the author plunges full ahead and the result is a fast paced constantly twisting tale in this 333 page novel that is well worth the read.Super Powers and reduce America to a smoldering pile of nuclear contaminated rubble by way of backpack nuclear weapons in the hands of sleeper agents scattered throughout the country.<br />Relying more on character development, plotting, and believable scenarios, this novel is a great improvement over the caliber of writing seen in \\"Path Of The Assassin.\\" While working on the secondary storyline of the slowly developing romantic relationship between Harvath and Meg, the author manages to convey new background information on the Harvath character.

His isolation, except for the occasional private investigator job for his friend and attorney, Billy Manchester, has allowed him to slowly come to grips with his actions extensively detailed in the first novel \\"The Blue Edge Of Midnight.\\"  However, the past still bothers him and he sees his pain reflected in the eyes of Billy's latest client.<br />Mark Mayes is a college student in Atlanta, Georgia and is considering going into the seminary. But, before he can do that, he needs answers about a painful family legacy. Mayes has found a number of letters, yellowed and brittle with age, in his grandmother's attic. The letters seem to indicate that his great-grandfather and two uncles who died in 1923 while working for a private company trying to build the first road across the Everglades may have been murdered. That road became the Tamiami Trail and like his long dead relatives something rarely spoken of in his family. If they were murdered, possibly on behalf of the company that was the law to itself in the merciless swamp, Mayes wants to take legal action against the company assuming it or some form of it still exists.<br />The great building projects have always taken many lives. The Tamiami Trail is no different in that it too is built upon the bones of the dead. But, as Max reads the copies of the letters again in lantern light in his shack, he too is struck by the power of the letters and the message of fear and desperation they convey. Something sinister was at work then and is still at work today resulting on an attempt on Max's life and other efforts to warn him off even before he starts work. It soon becomes clear that there are some that don't care to have the past uncovered and will stop at nothing to keep it that way.<br />While little is added to the development of the Max Freeman character, the author manages to skillfully build on the characters of others by way of two engaging secondary storylines involving characters familiar to readers of this series. Written with a prose style that reminds the reader of James Lee Burke where a few words create a powerful mental image, Jonathon King consistently brings the beauty of the Everglades alive as well as the despair and evil that lurks in the hearts of some. This author is one of the very few that can pull the reader in so deeply into his world while he delivers a complex and twisting tale of murder and deceit. His books are escapist literature and instead are far from it as they leave mental images not soon forgotten.little is added to the development of the Max Freeman character, the author manages to skillfully build on the characters of others by way of two engaging secondary storylines involving characters familiar to readers of this series.

His neighbor, Eugene Pettijohn, is well set in his ways and based on the snow around the barn and the absence of any tracks, hasn't milked the cow or tended to her upset calf. After taking care of both animals briefly, he wades through the deep snow to the front door of the house. He peers in as the door is open and sees Eugene, sitting near his table and staring sightlessly through the open doorway, dead of a bullet hole in the chest.<br />After further helping the animals in the barn, Herb makes his way back home to help his dog and her litter of pups. After that he calls the vet, Dr. Erica Merrill, to get medical help for the animals on both properties and then finally calls the Sheriff before going back to Eugene's place to wait for him.<br />Dr. Erica Merrill lives and runs her clinic out of her Mother's home, which is surrounded by ranchland owned and operated by other members of her family. Herb has a well-earned reputation for not being able to pay his bills and the last thing Erica wants to do is to add another bill to his account. But, he tells her about the Eugene's death and the dog does need help so she packs her gear and heads out to Herb's place.<br />After treating the dog she eventually discovers that Herb has been arrested for First Degree Murder, even though he insists strongly that he didn't do it. Because Herb put living animals ahead of the deceased, has a weapon similar to what must have been used to fire the fatal shot, a history of not liking or getting along with the deceased and a well known penchant for getting drunk, District Attorney Kline has had him arrested. If that wasn't enough evidence for Erica who questions the wisdom of arresting Herbert as well as the intellect of the DA, there is a set of tracks leading back and forth from Schultz's place making it clear to the DA that Herb killed. He does not accept any other explanation than his own and before long the absurdity of the situation begins to bug Erica and she publicizes her feelings about the case. Her reputation begins to suffer in the local community as does her struggling practice and with a DA convinced he has his man, Erica sees no choice but to start asking questions and investigate the case herself.<br />This interesting cozy style murder mystery features an incredibly large cast of characters, which at times threatens to bog down the reader. With so many relations by blood or marriage as well as numerous other characters involved, it sometimes becomes difficult to keep track of what is going on without a multi page flow chart.<br />At the same time, the case is interesting and the author does keep the reader involved as the book slowly moves forward.

He is back to visit his many friends, catch up on what he has been happening in the small town of Early, Michigan and to attend the annual Early's Founders Day Fair. However, his plans quickly go out the window and the former Detective is asked to again help the small police force, as a murder has been committed.<br />Librarian Penny Penelope has been found dead at the town's bookstore, Brickley's Books. She was struck several times in the head by an axe and based on the lack of blood at the scene, it is clear that her body was moved and later dumped at the bookstore. It is bad enough to have a dead body in a bookstore on any day, but even worse when the Fair is about to open and the bookstore is set to host Miss Holly LaFrance who will be signing copies of her new book. The very same book that was blasted in a scathing syndicated review column that happened to run in the local paper today.<br /> Brady is needed and despite some misgivings about being paired with Officer Alice Drinker, he is glad to assist. He misses serious police work and this case intrigues him from his first visit to the crime scene. As the fair opens and the investigation moves forward, they find that the killer wasn't the only one with secrets to hide. Public image is one thing but as so often the case, private reality is far different.<br />With many of the characters involved in Early's Pride back, this is another enjoyable read with characters that feel like old friends. Unlike the previous book, the focus in this \\"cozy\\" style murder mystery is primarily on Brady Kincaid and the case as well as some important decisions about his future that he needs to make. As such, there is less romance than in the previous book. Not to say there is not a romantic element, there certainly is, but the primary element in this novel is the mystery. The solution, which is readily apparent from early in the novel to seasoned mystery readers, still provides an enjoyable read and a very entertaining story.ch is readily apparent from early in the novel to seasoned mystery readers, still provides an enjoyable read and a very entertaining story.	2004-06-05

John March is now a private investigator three years after his life collapsed with the death of his wife thanks to a serial killer he was stalking on behalf of his employer at the time, the FBI. The pain is still fresh as are the constant and well-meaning efforts from family concerning his chosen profession. After all they reason, when one is born to money one should stay in a money field to make more and what he does for a living is so unseemly.<br />But March goes his own way as most loners do and at the request of a friend takes the strange case of Rick Pierro. Rick is wealthy by anyone's standards and is being blackmailed. From documents the blackmailer supplied and is threatening to use, it appears that Rick was a small part of a massive money-laundering scheme years ago. Part of the scheme has come to light in the last year or so and multiple investigations are underway. While Rick admits to doing business deals with the principals named in the documents, he claims that the documents themselves are fakes and that all his deals were and still are legit. With his job on Wall Street in jeopardy, Rick wants to pay off the blackmailer once, if the person can be convinced not to come back for more. Rick can't afford a hint of scandal should anything come out but has no intention of being bled dry either.<br />March thinks the whole deal is strange and problematic at best but agrees to do what he can. Before long, he suspects that Rick is lying to him and that Rick isn't the only one that the blackmailer has blackmailed. But the blackmailer, who takes offense at being looked for isn't the only one that has resources to deal with March. So too does a Federal Prosecutor and her task force which have to show result from months of investigation and at this point, they don't care how they go about it.<br />Hammered from all sides, March works the case in this complex and enjoyable novel. March is multi layered and complex as are many of the supporting characters. These characters were not cut out from cardboard but are instead created and soon come alive in the reader's imagination as the work moves forward.<br />At the same time, the storyline continually twists and turns as the novel works towards a conclusion hidden in the shadows. Nothing is what it seems or appears to be and as things move forward, events and characters get murkier and murkier in this gritty novel. This is an amazing book that this review does not do justice and is well worth the read./>Hammered from all sides, March works the case in this complex and enjoyable novel.

The narrator, Denis Borel, suddenly wealthy by the standards of the time has purchased a small cottage and retired from the hectic life of Paris. Alone except for the company of a manservant and a gardener, he spends his days playing his beloved Stradivarius violin and enjoys his solitude and music. Then one night, as he sits in his gazebo thinking about music, a strange light fills the night sky and a thunderous roar shakes the valley.<br />He learns from a neighbor that a hanger belonging to Dr. Omega has exploded. Borel knew nothing of Dr. Omega but learns quickly that others know of him and consider him something more than eccentric. According to his gardener....<br />\\"'He's an old gentleman with white hair dressed in black. There's something odd about him. The farmers think he's some kind of warlock, that he's got powers...Some are afraid of him, they think he has the evil eye....They avoid him like the plague....'\\" (Page 17)<br />After another night of strange dreams he sees Dr. Omega walking nearby and he becomes an obsession for Borel. He can't get the man out of his mind and constantly wonders what Dr. Omega is doing. He eventually goes to see the damage for himself and meets Dr. Omega.  After a few more days and more visits with Dr. Omega he is stunned to learn that Dr. Omega is building a ship out of some strange metal and it planning to go to Mars. Dr. Omega wants Borel to make the trip with him.<br />\\"'I am looking for a man of courage to be my companion on a fantastic voyage-the word is not too strong-an extraordinary journey that I have long labored to make possible.'\\" (Page 33)<br />Dr. Omega wants Borel to make the trip not just to Mars, but a visit to a Mars of the distant past, as the spaceship will cross space as well as time. Borel agrees and what follows is his narrative of the shipbuilding process, launch, and resulting numerous perilous adventures on Mars. Reminiscent of Jules Verne, it truly is a fantastic voyage across space and time that catapults the reader into a world that might have been. Fans of Doctor Who will surely note the amazing description of Dr. Omega and his ship, Cosmos, and the many similarities.<br />And maybe that is why this reader enjoyed the book so much. Or maybe it is because as part of classic pulp fiction, it harkens back to a wonderful time, when anything was possible in the intermingled worlds of science fiction and fantasy. Unlike many movies and novels of today that set a scene of cataclysmic destruction with a planet destroyed by chemical, biological, nuclear, or something else, this novel presents wondrous possibilities while occasionally mixing in for the more critical reader a little social commentary.<br />In short, this was simply a wonderful novel written in a style that just isn't done anymore. The added black and while illustrations from the original French publication in 1906 in the collector's edition are a very nice touch. They, along with the surrounding incredible story, make the collector's edition well worth owning as well as passing down to children. With all the violence and negativity reflected in today's fiction, regardless of the genre, it is very refreshing to read a work full of the potential of the human race and full of wonder.t truly is a fantastic voyage across space and time that catapults the reader into a world that might have been.

She soon spots him and he isn't very good at tailing her. She eventually confronts the man who isn't very good at hiring a private investigator either.<br />What the middle aged black man is good at is being a professor at nearby Harvard University. Dr. Wilson Chaney has a major problem. He recently had an affair with a student in one of his classes who subsequently died after the affair ended. He can't deny the affair should word leak out as someone has proof in the form of love letters he wrote the dead woman. Someone is using those letters to blackmail the professor, one letter at a time. He has already paid once, thinking that would be the end of it. Of course, it wasn't and now the blackmailer is back. The blackmailer is offering to sell him another letter at a hefty price increase.<br />For the professor, the problem isn't that he is black and the student was white. The issue is that this was the latest in a whole series of affairs he has conducted over the years, often with students. The political climate at Colleges and Universities has changed and with families suing schools, such behavior is no longer expected, accepted, and tolerated. It could cost him his prestigious, though non-tenured, position at Harvard as well as what is left of his shaky marriage. He can't afford to lose either for a variety of reasons. There are other considerations as well, which he refuses to specify, and Dr. Chaney wants help.<br />Despite the fact that Carlyle finds the man and his behavior to her and others despicable, she agrees to accept the case and begins looking for the blackmailer. Her mission is not to involve law enforcement but to instead, find a way to blackmail the blackmailer so that he or she stops. Carlyle has a couple of ideas how to go about this and as she works, it becomes increasingly clear that neither idea has any chance of success. In fact, as she investigates, the case becomes increasingly complex and goes in ways that she never saw coming and she has no idea who is doing what. But the blackmailer knows exactly what Carlyle is doing and what she wants and has no intention of putting up with Carlyle wandering around getting in the way and ruining a perfectly good payday.<br />While an interesting premise, something went wrong in the execution. Not only are most of the characters outside of Carlyle's circle of friends despicable in many ways, the read itself is flat and boring. While Carlyle tells the reader repeatedly how upset she is, how much she misses Sam (her on again off again love interest who now happens to be a major player in the Mob and not around), or how confused she is about her new relationship with FBI Agent Leonard Wells (first introduced in \\"The Big Dig\\") we never feel it. Instead, while constantly told, the connection with the reader is never made and as such, for this reader at least, never drawn into the world of the book. Left out and looking in, this slow book moves ponderously forward as Carlyle ruminates endlessly on what to do.<br />It doesn't matter if it is her personal life or her professional one, she constantly reminds one and all that they have to take her as is, and then doesn't have a clue what to do next. Unfortunately that has been the underlying theme of the last couple novels and this is no exception. While often thinking about her love life and how messed up it is she drifts from one weak lead to another working the case. In almost every meeting, the character she deals with is from the lower end of the gene pool and should be encouraged to crawl back under the rock he or she came from.<br />The ending does finally come after 310 pages but it takes a long time to get there. For those that are already familiar with the series, this one is one to skip. Nothing new happens and no advancement at all occurs in terms of character development. For those new to the series, this one could easily be read as a stand alone as except for a few vague references to the past, it deals with the present and does not reveal events from previous books. However, while it is a stand alone in that sense, it is not a good introduction to the author or her normally enjoyable work.f character development.

Dinner becomes \\"leftovers\\" with a little of this or that. No one is thrilled with the resulting hodgepodge of foods, but it has to be done from time to time. Occasionally, an author will do the same sort of thing by winding up various storylines and interspersing characters from other series. Stuart Woods certainly used the technique in his latest shallow Stone Barrington novel titled \\"Reckless Abandon.\\"<br />While the title could easily relate to the always studly Stone Barrington's way with women (usually several over the course of the novel) in this case it refers to the actions of Holly Barker, Police Chief of Orchid Beach, Florida. Coming over from the Orchid series, she is on the trail of a fugitive. She is chasing Trini Rodriguez and has a mass murder warrant for him. The problem is that the FBI has placed him in the Witness Protection Program because he is helping them with an investigation into a terrorist cell with links to the Middle East. Trini is a member of the Mafia and Holly believes that he is hiding out in New York City.<br />Stone takes her to Little Italy for lunch and within minutes; Holly spots Trini walking by and gives chase. She loses him almost as quickly and vows once again to get her man, one-way or the other. That becomes the primary theme of the novel. Holly, with Stone and his longtime ally, Dino, and occasionally others, pursue Trini across the country and back to New York, nearly having him before losing him again and again thanks to the FBI and/or the Mafia.<br />There are numerous side storylines in this novel as well and far too many to be mentioned here. Suffice it to say that several which have lingered from previous novels are solved and neatly tucked away while the novel also serves as a launching road for a new storyline and possibly a new series. As such, since those storylines are covered in detail, for those readers who start with this book, there will be no need to read earlier ones from the last couple of years.<br />This is typical Stone Barrington. He gets the beautiful lady, routinely exhausts himself in the bedroom or elsewhere in the process, and runs around New York driving expensive cars and eating fine foods. Thanks to his connections, he always outsmarts everyone and unlike Bond, there are no fussy superiors to deal with.

With the President and his family safe once again, Secret Service Agent Scot Harvath's mission is to find all those responsible for the plot. The final suspect of the Swiss mercenary team known as the Lions of Lucerne is expected to appear at the Macua Place Casino, a very old and still floating double-decker ferry casino, currently anchored at sea 60 kilometers west of Hong Kong.<br />The suspect appears across the gaming floor and before they can grab him he leaves. The chase is on as they follow the suspect back across to Macua and before long as a typhoon bears down on the area, they are engaged in a fierce running gun battle with the suspect. But the suspect isn't just shooting at them. He is also shooting at someone else, a figure that has silver eyes. When the suspect is killed by the figure with silver eyes, Scott begins chasing that suspect and despite the resulting harrowing car chase, the suspect gets away.<br />At the same time, a group billing itself as The Hand Of God begins to unleash a series of coordinated attacks across the Arab world. Thanks to evidence left at the scenes and public press releases, it appears that the Israeli Government is sponsoring and supporting the group that aims to bring terror to the Arab world. Scot, temporarily back home, believes that instead, it might be the work of Hashim Nidal, the son of the famous terrorist, Abu Nidal. Scot further suspects that Hashim might very well be the suspect with the silver eyes that got away. Despite political infighting and conflicting orders, he begins a worldwide manhunt for both suspects while remaining convinced that they are the same person.<br />Unlike the debut novel \\"The Lions of Lucerne\\" which was full of complex characters and numerous plot twists, this thriller is a straightforward action adventure read that is simplistic in style and tone. The novel seems written entirely for depiction as a movie in an attempt to replace the cinematic James Bond series. No additional depth is given to his character, every decision he makes is right despite working for always idiotic bosses, and no matter the circumstances, he pulls all the other cardboard characters out of danger almost single handily each and every single time.

Tracy	One can't pick up the paper or watch the news these days without seeing a story about how video games are the root cause of all evil in the world. The theory being that because of the violence in video games, kids are acting out more and getting into serious trouble, even death. But what if a killer actually used a game as a way not only to kill but to also devastate the game's creators? That is the backdrop for this intense novel by a mother/daughter writing team using the name of P. J. Tracy.<br />The game is SKUD, which stands for Serial Killer Detective. Created by the five somewhat eccentric owners of the computer company Monkeewrench, the game has 17 murder scenarios featuring increasing difficulty. The player is to work each crime scene as a real life detective and build upon the evidence while shrinking the list of suspects until the killer is found. A test version is up on the Internet for advance orders and so far, out of the large number playing the game, no one has gotten very far in playing their creation. But the orders are pouring in and the group stands to be rich.<br />That is until someone in real life starts duplicating the cyber death scenes in the game down to every last detail. Not only is a serial killer using their game as a springboard to kill he begins to very personally taunt the police as well as the Monkeewrench group. While distrustful of the police for good reason as the complicated back-story explains, the group is forced into cooperating with the police in a search for the killer as their shared nightmare comes alive once again.<br />Sometimes when a novel is written by more than one person, the resulting effort is a choppy and uneven read. That isn't the case here where this writing team has crafted a seamless thriller full of complicated characters, vivid descriptions, occasional humor, and a complex multi layered plot. Nor does the book go off into a tangent and in great detail about the game. The game is a backdrop but not the focus as the real focus is character development and the hunt for the killer. This book comes alive for the reader and the resulting work is extremely hard to put down unfinished.cus as the real focus is character development and the hunt for the killer.

Officially, he runs the Office of Regional Research within the BAC. Unofficially, he is the Governor's man for sticky problems where the worlds of politics and crime intersect. The murder of a Russian on the shores of Lake Superior has fast become a political problem and Davenport's talents are needed.<br />The dead man has finally been identified as Rodion Oleshev and he was shot three times-once in the heart and twice in the forehead. He died two weeks ago on a concrete slab next to a grain elevator on the shores of Lake Superior one night. The death of what apparently was at one time a KGB agent has become a major political problem. The dead man, not only was still a spy, but also was the son of a very high-ranking person in the Oil Ministry in Russia. The father has talked to Putin and the Russian Embassy has contacted the State Department. The ball has rolled downhill gathering steam and urgency and now Rose Marie Roux, Davenport's longtime boss, is handling the issue to Davenport. The Russians are sending someone to oversee the investigation and review it. Rose Marie wants Davenport to make sure that everything that could be done has been done and to make sure the Russian is happy. Send the Russian back home satisfied and make everyone look good, especially the BAC, because yet another budgetary cutback is in store for the new agency.<br />Davenport begins to investigate while awaiting the arrival of the Russian by talking to the Feds. The FBI is running the investigation, not as a homicide but as an intelligence operation trying to uncover possible Russian deep cover assets in the area. They have virtually nothing after two weeks and ask Davenport to share whatever information he uncovers in the course of his homicide investigation and not to blow their case. That is, if they can ever develop anything. With no leads and no suspects, a somewhat bored Davenport is thrilled with the prospects whether he wants to publicly admit it or not.<br />Despite political problems and other issues such as the real reasons the Russian has arrived, Davenport begins to make progress. Before long, Davenport is tearing up the countryside in search of suspects and John Sandford has this reader pulled deep into his view of the world once again. As in other novels of this series, almost everyone is back, a little older and a little wiser, and still very interested in getting all the bad guys no matter what.

All too often the second book from an author is weaker in terms of character development, plot or some other structural problem. That certainly isn't the case here where the author has once again combined intriguing complicated characters with cutting edge science to produce another intense read.<br />Seth Peterson witnesses a car crash during a snowstorm in Washington, D.C. As the crashed Blazer begins to smolder and the on looking crowd does nothing, Seth rescues the driver narrowly escaping the escalating flames. Unfortunately for the seriously social phobic Seth, the rescue brings unwanted media attention.<br />Seth has more than enough scrutiny that he can stand thanks to his discovery. As a Polar Ice Researcher, he believes that he has developed a program through his job at the National Ice Center, to identify where and when large slabs of the Antarctic Ice Shelf might break away. The results of such a massive release of ice would be disastrous for a world unprepared. Such knowledge could be worth millions and power to some.<br />Such knowledge would especially be important to members of a doomsday cult that believes an ancient and very overdue prophecy is finally about to come to fruition. Since Seth can predict where and when, it stands to reason in their minds he could assist them in actually making it happen. They need his knowledge willing or otherwise to assist them to fulfill the prophecy and thanks to the media exposure have a very good idea where to find him.<br />The chase is on as Seth narrowly escapes their clutches and what follows in this 244 page novel is a book full of intriguing characters with plenty of action as well as plenty of plot twists and turns. The book does slow down at times as information on ice formation and little known opposing viewpoints on the issue of Global Warming are discussed. However, each time the information is presented, it is done in an educational non-preachy way and is used to ultimately further advance the book.<br />This is one of those authors that modern publishing houses who seem bent on following cookie cutter methods should pick up. Better than a lot of what is being pushed by the big boys of publishing, this novel is an example of an author who can be counted on to write tight well-written novels full of intriguing characters and cutting edge science. This book, like his first, is well worth the read and this is one author you should definitely keep your eye on for the future.ssed.

Alex is a former FBI agent born and raised in Winter's End, Maine. He hasn't been home once since he left years ago and now has resurrected his life as a private investigator in Boston.<br />But Sheriff Dale Townsend, brother of his best friend in school, needs his help. Sheriff Townsend has a suspect in the recent murder of a local woman.  While the suspect was seen standing over the nude body holding knives in his hands during a heavy rain, there is not any proof that he actually committed the murder. The man won't confess or say anything meaningful at all and the Sheriff is stumped. The Sheriff and Alex worked another case a couple of years ago by phone with Alex suggesting a couple of things and that fact along with the fact that Alex had a reputation as a very good interrogator before his mental breakdown several years ago, convinces him that Alex is the man for the job. They need identification of the suspect and a confession fast as the local population is very upset and the pressure is on to close the case.<br />Alex agrees to help and soon finds himself back home in Winter's End dealing with a suspect that seems to be playing with him for his own amusement. At the same time, Alex begins to confront why he left in the first place and his actions the last several years. Alex is forced to deal with the past as dark forces move around him, pushing him towards a final confrontation and not just with the suspect.<br />Vast stretches of this debut novel reminded me tremendously of work by James Lee Burke. The author's use of imagery that, in this case is often the play of light and shadow evoked the association, as did his use of disturbing dreams and visions. Much like in James Lee Burke's works where the dead take visible form and have a message for the living, the same sort of thing happens in this novel several times. Alex's subconscious is very active and as this nearly three hundred-page novel works to its conclusion, the line of sanity becomes increasingly blurred.<br />At the same time, the character of Alex like many of the other characters in this novel is slowly developed. Unlike many first time novelists who perform a sort of data dump on the reader, each piece of background info is slowly doled out to the reader. As such, along with the other elements of pacing, plot, action, etc. everything is slowly but consistently moved forward tightening the grip on the reader as the novel unfolds.<br />This is a complex and very enjoyable novel and one of the best books I have read in a long time. Hopefully, this is the beginning not only of a series, but also of a novelist's career.

Parker does not provide novels with deep complicated characters or byzantine plots. What he does provide, especially in the Spenser series novels, are books where good is clearly good, bad is very bad and gray simply, for the most part, does not exist. The characters are shallow, the women are usually attracted to Spenser but he will resist mightily their advances because of his love for Susan, and Hawk will be there with style to provide needed muscle on occasion. In short, it is a formula that has worked for years and his latest novel, Bad Business, follows the formula making it another lightweight though entertaining read.<br />This time around the initial beautiful woman near tears in Spenser's office is Marlene Cowley. She wants to hire Spenser to investigate her husband, Trent Cowley. She is convinced he is cheating on her and wants proof that will humiliate and destroy him in open court. Spenser reluctantly agrees as he does not care for this type of cases and such proof isn't required in the courts of today.<br />Before long, Spenser discovers that his client has a tail of her own. Apparently Trent shares the same concerns and has hired another investigator to tail her. The two investigators as a matter of professional courtesy acknowledge each other's case but neither can explain why there soon appears to be yet another investigator involved. Spenser begins looking at that angle and before he can get very far, the deaths begin. The two investigators soon vanish and Spenser is left working a case that grows stranger by the day.<br />The reader is left with a shallow but entertaining read as Spenser delves into the world of corporate finance. Hawk is his usual self, Susan is beautiful and offers insightful advice when needed as always, and Pearl the wonder dog is always around and the subject of many asides. In short, this is the usual Spenser with no surprises and no new ground is covered. The novel at 310 pages is a fast read and by the end, all is right with the world once again.

She is working as a waitress at the Ahwahnee Hotel located in the park instead of her normal duties as a Park Ranger. Four park employees have vanished and Search and Rescue teams, some of the best in the business, have been unable to find the missing employees. The Deputy Superintendent puts it down to their youth and thinks they went hitchhiking to Mexico or somewhere warmer. Lorraine Knight, Superintendent of the Park, suspects something sinister and after an interview where the two women made an instant connection, Anna jumped at the assignment.<br /> Not that she was thrilled with working undercover as a waitress. But Anna has never been able to let a good mystery go and this one, where all were seen in separate places and times in the Park before vanishing, has her intrigued. Then there is the factor that, as long time readers of the series know, Anna is happiest when surrounded by soaring mountains where she can find her blessed solitude. This is a chance to do both. But from her first minutes in the park on the valley floor, known as \\"the ditch\\" by employees, she senses evil in man made form has taken root in the historic park. Her suspicions are quickly confirmed in very different ways and she begin to pull the wildly disparate pieces together which will lead to several violent confrontations.<br />Unlike the last several books, Anna, for the most part, is calm and levelheaded. Gone are the delusions used to limited effect in her most recent novel, \\"Flashback.\\" She isn't vacillating emotionally as she has done in the last several and while occasionally and understandably homesick, she manages to stay focused on the problems at hand. This novel is grounded firmly in reality and the danger of the moment and despite a nod to the evil that lurks within us all that can be unleashed at the right moment, it does not use artificial storytelling instruments such as flashbacks to ostensibly move the work forward. No letters from dead relatives or dreams in the night either. Instead, author Nevada Barr has gone back to what made her successful in the first place-straightforward intense storytelling like in her first novel \\"Track of the Cat.\\"<br /> While no new ground is turned in terms of character development, this novel is a refreshing read. Anna seems more poised and competent than in the last several novels, as she should be considering her age. She still bumbles her way into trouble now and then but at the same time, she comes prepared in this one.<br />Despite some of the negative reviews here, this novel works on all levels and becomes a fast paced intense read that features some of Nevada Barr's best wring in years.

There are many books out there with a \\"thriller\\" designation attached to their title and quite often; they aren't a thriller on any level. Then there are those books that should have the designation and for whatever unfathomable reason, don't. Those books may not have the designation but should because they are in fact, thrillers. \\"The Firefly\\" by the always very enjoyable P. T. Deutermann is a glaring case in point.<br />After the tragedy of 9/11, Retired Secret Service Agent Swamp Morgan was recalled to active duty, as were hundreds if not thousands of agents and investigators throughout the various federal law enforcement agencies. Swamp is now operating out of a small segment of the large umbrella organization known as the Department of Homeland Security. Swamp is assigned to investigate a strange fire at a local medical clinic as inauguration day fast approaches.<br />Six weeks ago, a large fire burned at a private clinic specializing in plastic surgery killing two doctors and two nurses. All the bodies, badly charred, were found in an operating room that clearly had just been used for surgery but there was no sign of the patient. The case becomes stranger as the fire burned much hotter than it should have and from all appearances seems to indicate arson.  Could the missing patient have done it and if so, why? Then part of a medical transcript of a patient record is found and not only were some possibly illegal activities going on at the clinic but there is some sort of threat to the President. Swamp is tasked with evaluating the information and he is to determine whether the threat is real or not. If not real, it is a firefly and in Washington terms, slap it back down in the grass where it belongs.<br />Swamp begins to investigate and soon begins to discover evidence-circumstantial and coincidental in the eyes of others-that leads him to suspect this is no firefly but the real deal. Despite public statements to the contrary, control of turf and power still rule the day in Washington and as Swamp pursues his theory as tasked, he begins to lose allies and make powerful new enemies along the way. Those in power sending him out to investigate don't seem to care that he might be right and begin to openly question his judgment. They seem convinced that he is wrong but what if he is right?<br />This 387-page novel is classic Deutermann. This ninth novel of his features his usual high caliber tight writing with interesting characters and plenty of action. Then there is his ability to lay out the characters and the entire situation and then in a few short pages, flip everything over into a new direction before doing it again and again.<br />Much like Robert Ludlum did in his early novels, Deutermann creates a world where reality is far different from the perceived illusion. By coming up with wheels within wheels and multiple agendas by almost everyone else but the main character, one never really knows who the players are for real all the way to the last page of his book. In this case, make sure you set aside enough time to finish the last 100 pages in one reading because it is one heck of an intense roller coaster style thrill ride.trary, control of turf and power still rule the day in Washington and as Swamp pursues his theory as tasked, he begins to lose allies and make powerful new enemies along the way.

As in his series work, individuals within the U.S. Government who seek to profit off of others are once again the target of the author's wrath as well as the fact that the MIA issue remains unsolved due to sheer political greed.<br />In 1972 Roy Harper was shot down over North Vietnam. He survived the crash, was listed as Missing In Action, and thirty years later arrives home and on his brother's doorstep. His brother, Jason Harper is married with a young son and is a small town newspaper editor as well as co owner of the small paper with his wife, Patty. When his brother arrives in the middle of the night seeking his help, Jason lets him in against the wishes of his wife who isn't convinced that the scruffy man is really Roy.<br />By doing so, Jason unleashes a wave of terror on his family and friends. Roy is a target of a hit squad with instructions to kill him as well as anyone he goes to seeking help. There simply can't be any record of his astounding story or any witnesses left alive. Roy, Jason, and his family are soon on the run with a determined team in their wake. Assuming they can stay alive long enough, it will be one heck of a story about the past and corruption at the highest levels of American government. But they need proof and there is at least one witness who knows all that must be found first. Then there is the question of whether Roy is really Roy as he claims or someone at random that has drawn them into his nightmare.<br />It is extremely tempting to attempt to draw links between these fictional characters in this 372-page novel and certain high profile public officials in and out of government service. Certain hints are planted in regards to some of the characters and one gets the feeling that a majority if not all of this book is a thinly fictionalized veil over the truth. If so, the fact that the events depicted or something similar could happen is appalling and if it got out and was proven true, would shake the foundations of American Government far more than anything that has happened in the past.<br />If it is fiction and nothing more than fiction, the book is reduced to being just an incredible read. Full of complex characters, intrigue, plot twists and plenty of action, it also reminds this reviewer of early Robert Ludlum work. This novel certainly deserves the \\"Thriller\\" designation even though it is not marketed as such. As in his other books, Brendan Dubois once again writes an intense character driven novel that is a very good read.nalized veil over the truth.

A problem that seems to get steadily worse by the day. Daniel Ames is an associate for the prestigious law firm of Reed, Briggs, Stephens, Stottlemer and Compton, Portland's largest and most prestigious law firm. A child who escaped poverty, Daniel has made it and has a firm grasp on his future while he knows how easily it could all slip away. It begins to slip away after he lets a memo slip through the discovery process on a case involving Geller Pharmaceuticals.<br />Geller is being sued for millions over their drug Insufort. Some of the mothers given Insufort while pregnant, delivered babies with various severe birth defects. A very high profile attorney, Aaron Flynn is the lead attorney and he is very publicly suing the company as well as scouring the country for more victims to add to his lawsuit. Briggs is representing the company and all the internal company documentation seems to indicate that the drug passed all the usual tests.<br />Then, during the discovery process, a memo appears that Daniel should have caught. According to the memo, there was a study conducted on monkeys using Insufort and there were major problems, including birth defects. It is major evidence and Daniel is in a lot of trouble with his bosses. Aaron Flynn now has the documentation he needs for the case and it is all Daniel's fault.<br />Daniel, seeking desperately to get himself out of trouble, wants to talk to the scientist in question. Everyone involved at Geller denies the study was ever done and when Daniel checks out the scientists' home, he finds it ransacked. Unwittingly, Daniel soon becomes a pawn of both sides as the stakes steadily go up. As the pressure ratchets up on him, he also manages to get himself involved in a vendetta from years ago as scores are settled.<br />While this is an enjoyable read, it is primarily an action adventure style of novel and not much of a legal thriller. The major characters spend very little time in the courtroom and mostly, out in the field, dodging hired gunmen. If your looking for long scenes of intense courtroom action with complicated characters and motives, this is not the book to find them. Instead, with the occasional twist or turn, these shallow people work towards a strong conclusion, followed by a rather surprisingly simplistic ending. While an enjoyable read at 292 pages, this is a book that is easily forgotten as one moves on looking for more substantial sustenance.ime in the courtroom and mostly, out in the field, dodging hired gunmen.

He never, ever takes cases with drug defendants. As a widower with a daughter, Sarah who is now fifteen, it simply isn't worth it to him. The complications and the greed involved in such cases could easily get a lawyer killed.<br />That is one of his first thoughts about a client that his old friend Nick Rush wants Paul to meet. Nick claims that he can't take the case because of a conflict of interest involving himself, the client, and Nick's law firm of Rocker, Dusha and Dewine. Nick has his hands full with the after effects of a divorce, a marriage to a trophy wife who wants it all, and interoffice politics at the law firm. Things aren't working out and Nick really needs Paul's help.<br />But when Paul meets the client, Gerald Metz, who is the target of a federal grand jury, things don't ring true. Metz is a general contractor and claims that he was working on a deal with two sons of a powerful Mexico businessman to bring heavy equipment down from San Diego to Southern Mexico to build a resort. This does not make sense to Paul considering the economics involved and the story gets worse as Metz explains that the deal never went through but he was paid incredible amounts of money in consulting fees. Fees paid far in excess of what would be normal and were not handled in the proper manner. To Paul, it looks like a case of money laundering and most likely necessary because it has something to do with the drug trade.<br />Paul refuses the case and his suspicions seem correct a short time later as Nick and Metz are gunned down on the steps of the courthouse in a drive by. Nick feels responsible in the death of his friend because he did not take the case. Driven by guilt he begins to investigate and eventually the trail leads to Mexico and a violent confrontation at the top of what is left of an ancient Mayan Temple Pyramid.<br />Overall, this is an enjoyable novel that is amazing slow to get going. The latest in the series featuring Paul Mandraini does not shed any new light on the character. Sarah is non-existent in this novel, mentioned only in passing, as are several other characters from earlier novels. Additionally, this novel is written in a more distant, objective style that the earlier ones in this series which may also relate to the much slower than normal start to the work.<br />Those that stick with this novel which could be read independent of the series, will find this 400 page novel well worth the effort. The last 100 pages, which lead to the violent confrontation at the top of a Mayan Pyramid Temple, are full of twists and turns and plenty of action. Those last 100 pages alone make this novel well worth reading and very hard to put down.this is an enjoyable novel that is amazing slow to get going.

As such, this new series of which this is the second book, reflects not only a change in focus but also a subtle difference in writing style to a more distant view of the characters. While temperament of the new series is also different, this new series not only showcases familiar characters, it also retains the literary flavor of the southern New Mexico region that the author clearly loves.<br />Opening a little after \\"Scavengers\\" left off, Posadas County Undersheriff Guzman is picking up her dry cleaning while in the village of Posadas, New Mexico.  As she stands next to her patrol unit preparing to get back inside, she hears the distinctive whine of tires on pavement and engines at high speed. She can hear two vehicles in some sort of chase and knows that somewhere along their route as they draw closer, residents have already called and complained to the village Police Department. She has time to realize that the lead vehicle is a motorcycle with a car in close pursuit and then the unthinkable happens.  Undersheriff Guzman is witness to a horrible crash at the end of the street as the motorcycle goes out of control, throwing the rider into the base of a utility pole. Seconds later, she witness the near crash of a Posadas Village patrol car as it slides through the accident scene.<br />Despite what the misleading jacket copy states, which must have been written by someone who never read this book or the series, Posadas Village isn't really part of Undersheriff Guzman's Department. That fact does not stop her from being able to respond or request help. She does both and realizes that the Patrol car, now stopped, never had its lights or siren running and since they share frequencies, is sure she never heard the officer radio dispatch. The village patrolman, Perry Kenderman, whom she has known for some time, seems uncharacteristically dazed and confused as he stands surveying the wreckage and does nothing to assist the rider who lies crumpled at the base of the utility pole.<br />The rider died at impact and Undersheriff Guzman wonders why Kenderman is acting so strange. She also wonders when he is initially questioned, why he lies, as she knows that the events he describes leading up to the crash, simply did not happen. He is lying through his teeth and not very good at it. As the investigation begins into what really happened, the District Attorney, Dan Schroeder, drops another bombshell.<br />In an unrelated matter, he informs her that George Enriquez, about to be indicted in all likelihood by the grand jury for insurance fraud has asked to make a deal. Enriquez told the DA, \\"I can give you Guzman.\\" Like the Undersheriff, the DA has no idea what he meant and he never showed up for the meeting to explain. The obvious conclusion is that he meant the Undersheriff but she is unable to think of anything that she had to do with him beyond investigating some of his alleged insurance fraud. In fact, she is to be a major witness when the Grand Jury convenes.<br />When Enriquez is found dead of what was supposed to appear as a self-inflicted gunshot, the eye of suspicion naturally falls on the Undersheriff. While nothing is said to her, the word soon spreads while she tries to work the motorcycle crash case. At the same time, she can't stay away from this new problem and thanks to her sterling reputation is allowed some free reign to work that case as well.<br />Steven F Havill has always managed to work unconnected and very complicated twin storylines in his novels and this is no exception. While the easy familiarity of the Gastner novels are gone in favor of the stiffer prose reflecting the temperament of the primary character, Undersheriff Guzman, the read is still quite enjoyable. Nothing could replace Gastner, his constant battle against insomnia and his penchant for driving the county at all hours of the night as he ruminated on a case. However, in her own way, Guzman is becoming more and more a major viable figure in her own novels. Undersheriff Guzman ruminates as well in her own way and with the stylistic changes, the author makes it clear that while it may feature many of the same very familiar characters, this is a different series. Despite the changes, which do take some getting used to, this book and new series, is well worth the read.ill quite enjoyable.

As 19977 became 1978 other things in New York City like the arrest of the Son of Sam killer garner media attention. For recently retired Police Officer Moe Prager, the disappearance of Patrick Maloney, Jr. is insignificant and no different than many of the ills that befall the city's population. Not that Patrick isn't important in his own right, but Moe has more on his mind thanks to a ruined knee and is facing limited prospects and a lonely life.<br /> At relative loose ends when his friend and still a cop Rico Tripoli calls, he agrees to meet him for lunch at a local restaurant. Rico wants to talk to him about looking for Patrick. Once there, despite the obvious racism of the missing man's powerful father, Patrick Maloney, he agrees to start working the case in exchange for a favor regarding a much needed liquor license. Moe's brother wants him to go in with him on a wine shop and without any other options Moe has sort of agreed to do so. As he begins working the case, he realizes that he has missed the streets and soon discovers that everyone involved is lying to him. Nothing is the way he thought it was with his enemies or his friends.<br /> Twenty years later the case still haunts him and a call from a Nun in a local hospice brings it all back to life. A man is dying and wishes to unburden himself and will only do so to Me Prager. He may finally get the last piece of the painful puzzle that has haunted him for years and nearly destroyed his family.<br /> This is a very good novel featuring a number of interesting characters. The read is a little disconcerting at times as it moves back and forth between 1977 and 78, and the present (1998). I'm not a fan of flashbacks, extended or otherwise, but in this case it actually enhances the story. By moving back and forth, it creates a different perspective for the reader as the mystery is slowly solved.<br /> At the same time, the author has an incredible sense of detail and an uncanny ability to bring the work alive for the reader. He really got into my head and made me feel like I was there right with him, step for step, as he worked the case. There are not very many authors who can totally pull me into their world like that and he did it easily within the first ten pages or so. His characters were rich and complex with a decidedly noir slant and his sense of pacing and story development was right on.<br /> This was a very good read and according to my local library, the first novel of a new series built around the main character, Moe Prager. Unfortunately my local library does not have his earlier novels, \\"Little Easter,\\" Life Goes Sleeping,\\" and \\"They don't Play Stickball In Milwaukee.\\" You can bet I'm going to be looking for them.ime, the author has an incredible sense of detail and an uncanny ability to bring the work alive for the reader.

Instead, this slow, boring book should have been titled as \\"P is for Poor.\\"<br />Dr Dowan Purcell has been missing for weeks when Kinsey receives a call from his ex-wife Fiona. Fiona, a potentially difficult client at best, is sure the good doctor ran away from his current wife Crystal. Fiona is convinced that she drove him away and that he eventually would have come back to her. Instead, to avoid the evil clutches of Crystal, the Doctor has skipped to Central America or maybe even Europe. Fiona is abusive and condescending and still Kinsey agrees to take the case.<br />She then sets out on a tedious and detailed canvass of everyone and anyone that ever knew Dr. Purcell. She starts with his current wife Crystal who is convinced now that nine weeks have passed, that he is dead. She seems accepting of the possibility and has her hands full with her out of control daughter, Leila. Leila does not break new ground and like all the other characters in this novel, comes right out of character maker software. Leila is a classic out of control teenager.  If you have ever seen any talk television or were unlucky to have a punk in your neighborhood, this is Leila. She hates her life and everything she has and spends the novel whining and rebelling. This allows the reader to meet the biological father as well as the other characters that populate Leila's world.<br />Along the way, as she investigates the doctor and the nursing home where Dr. Purcell was a glorified administrator, Kinsey manages to get herself into a conflict between brothers. After renting out office space from them, she finds out that they probably killed their parents and fled from Texas with ill-gotten gains. Unlike the notorious Menendez brothers, these two seem to have gotten away with it until now.<br />With stereotypical characters, plodding action, and a weak story that just does not move for much of this 352-page novel, this offering is a real disappointment.novel, this offering is a real disappointment.	2004-03-31

For example, Robert Ludlum and Tom Clancy, just to name two, have often used rogue CIA operatives as part of their many novels and to great effect. In the past, the Cold War provided the backdrop for such operations. With the theoretical end of the Cold War, there was concern that like black and white movies, the times had passed such topics by. Now, in what is sure to be a flood of such novels, Muslim fanaticism and the global war on terror are replacing the Cold War as a fictional backdrop. Rogue elements in the CIA in fiction along with the occasional glimpses through Congressional hearings in real life makes this novel highly believable.<br />Somewhere in America, an Al-Queada terrorist cell has a rocket launcher and some missiles for it. With the death of Osama Bin Laden (treated as fact), Al-Queada has reconstituted itself under new leadership and become a smaller, more efficient terrorist organization. They have learned the ultimate lesson of the terrorist attacks-America was hurt much worse by the economic impact of such actions than by the casualty toll. The terrorists release videotape to the major networks detailing their threat to fire missiles somewhere in the United States. They promise to attack schools, shopping centers, etc. to make the point again that one is ever safe.<br />Panic grips the nation exacerbated by the twenty four hour seven day a week cable news coverage of the threat. Schools, business, shopping centers, etc. begin to close as the nation's commerce grinds to a halt. For Mark Beamon, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Phoenix Office, the situation is doubly frustrating. Not only is this not his case and that has been made clear by his superiors, he has massive personal problems of his own.<br />Mark is less than happy with his current role in the FBI. As detailed in the earlier three novels of this series character, Mark Beamon is a loner and does not play well with others. He certainly does not really fit into the model of what an agent is in the currently politically correct version of today's FBI. He eschews office politics and relies on results. About to be fired, arrested and imprisoned for his previous actions, the incoming President saved him from himself. Thanks to having a friend on the White House Staff, he was instead sent to dead-end his career in charge of the Phoenix office. Management is not his thing and as the ongoing office audit makes clear, his talents are better suited to working cases, not people.<br />Because of his connections to other agents from past cases, Mark begins to get separate but important pieces of information that he is not supposed to have access to. He sees a totally different track to the case and his ideas conflict with his superior's public statements. He begins to suspect that the terrorists have links to organized crime and wonders why the CIA isn't telling all they know. Soon his suspicions prove correct as a fellow agent and long time friend is executed while both are on an undercover operation. Allowed to survive, Mark Beamon begins to work the case from deep undercover using any resources and methods necessary to find not only the rocket launcher but also those responsible inside and outside of government.<br />This is an extremely complicated novel, which in my summary, I have failed to do justice to. As the really good novels do, it works on many levels with puzzles within puzzles. The players are extremely complicated and multi-dimensional and there are a large number of plot twists. The action is frequently intense and the novel moves forward at a steady clip.<br />One also has to wonder just how much of this novel is actual fact and not conjecture. Tom Clancy took an active involvement in this author's career from the early stages including helping him get his first novel published titled\\"Rising Phoenix.\\" Tom Clancy has long been known for his access to highly classified government information and sources and is said to have introduced Kyle Mills to many of the same information resources. One often gets the feeling in reading his novels that Kyle Mills barely fictionalizes many important details. If true in this case, he is providing some very interesting material on the war in terrorism in this very enjoyable thriller.\\"Rising Phoenix.\\" Tom Clancy has long been known for his access to highly classified government information and sources and is said to have introduced Kyle Mills to many of the same information resources.

It certainly is true in this novel and that aspect will not be addressed in this review as to do so would reveal most if not all of this very enjoyable novel.<br />Donald Hope is the captain of the charter boat Oona, operating out of the British Virgin Islands. His twin-hulled catamaran needs expensive work and he needs to get one last charter done before having at least some of the work done. To do so, he needs to get to port fast to pick up his last set of clients. He is running behind because he had to disperse the ashes of his lover and friend Barbara who finally succumbed to a yearlong coma. Then his race to port is further interrupted by a near disastrous collision with the USS Vermont, a nuclear attack submarine that suffers total computer failure. After being checked out by the very upset navy crewmen who initially believe he may have been involved with their problems, he proceeds to port arriving hours after he was scheduled. Upon arrival, he discovers that his trip was for nothing as his charter has cancelled due to their being hospitalized for food poisoning.<br />While trying to figure out how to salvage what is left of his business as well as his boat, he meets Sally Moffitt in a bar. She comes with a laundry list of her own problems as well as plenty of attitude and he does not really want anything to do with her. But, she would be a paying client if he accepts her charter job so that she can work on a nature film documentary. With great reluctance, he finally agrees and after she steals her gear back from her soon to be ex-husband, they flee on board Oona.<br />Within hours of leaving the port, they spot a strange sea creature dancing off their port bow. Part Dolphin, part something else, the creature whatever it is, behaves nothing like they have ever seen before and seems to be attracted to the twin hulled catamaran. As the creature allows them glimpses of it and its strange behavior, Sally becomes convinced that this is the subject for her film and something that no one has ever seen before. Sally is sure that if she can capture enough footage it will allow her to make her mark in the world of expensive nature documentaries and bring her the fame and fortune she needs to make the films she wants to do as well as putting it in her soon to be ex-husband's face.<br />As they follow the creature northward, they are intercepted by the Star of Alabama, a five masted sailing ship in the mode of old but thoroughly modern from stem to stern. Under the command of William Tree, this floating research vessel cost millions and as a member of one of America's most powerful and wealth families, power and control is everything. While beguiling Sally with various offers to fund her work if a suitable subject is found, he is not so able to blind David Hope.<br />David knows something sinister is up with Tree and begins to wonder if Tree and the strange sea creature are somehow linked. As the creature continues to lead them north, both ships follow and slowly David and Sally begin to figure out the puzzle. As man and nature try to stop them, David and Sally try not only to survive but also document the strange creature.<br />This is a very enjoyable fast paced novel featuring intriguing characters and an interesting premise. While most of the action involves chasing the creature and sailing the boats involved, it is not overly filled with technical sailing jargon.

As many others have theorized, global warming has taken place and coastal cities are either gone or surrounded by large dikes in a slowly failing attempt to keep the waters out of the streets. With the rise in temps, the UV rays have become a major worry along with the resultant increase in skin cancers, as well as other types. Regional conflicts have become more heated while at the same time, through the use of technology; the United States has become much more repressive.  The FBI has become a law unto themselves and something known as the cube, has replaced television. But, while things have changed, some things like dirty politics, extortion and murder are all still common.<br />All three are set into motion by the ominous message recorded by Astronomy Professor Aurora \\"Rory\\" Bell in Gainesville, Florida. In a repeated gamma burst transmission, the same message is sent over and over again-\\"We're coming.\\" They apparently are as scientists on the moon confirm the transmission as well as the fact that it came from deep space. Clearly from beyond where any human spacecraft has gone, the ship seems to be three months out from arriving on Earth. In fact, it appears that it will arrive on New Year's Day, 2056 and the event is quickly dubbed \\"The Second Coming\\" by the media.<br />The message and imminent arrival of an alien craft swings into motion a number of events over the next three months as detailed in the book, including the eventual arrival of the alien craft. Some events have a direct relation to the arrival, while many, seen through numerous characters do not. The science fiction elements become very secondary as the work focuses more on the human relationships between the many, many  characters as well as various casual linkages between them.<br />Which is where the interesting premise and story are tremendously weakened by the execution. Almost every other page, the reader is shifted to the point of view of another character. After fifteen or twenty of these shifts in perspective, it becomes rather annoying as stereotypical character after character is added. At times, the work switches back to the allegedly main characters, but more often than not, it is off in some sort of far-flung jaunt through the actions of a distantly related character. That problem of story telling along with the insertion of two very graphic gratuitous sex scenes which seem to have no purpose other than to serve as titillation on someone's whim, weaken this novel tremendously. In so doing, an interesting premise with lots of potential becomes a lower than average read and a real disappointment., the reader is shifted to the point of view of another character.

Every time, I watch the thing simply because it is so bad, it is good. It features a human fighting for the good of the universe on a distant planet where evil is pure evil, and all the women are beautiful, dressed in some great outfits and attracted to the hero. It came to mind when I was reading this book, which is pretty much along those lines. The hero is great, the evil is really evil and lots of women are half naked or completely naked. Of course, our hero must save the known and unknown universe; the women are all attracted to him and require his personal and complete attention.<br />Our hero is Jason Williams. Jason is troubled by a regularly recurring dream that is incredibly intense and disturbing. He goes to see his family physician, Dr. Arnold, who eventually refers him to a Dr. Gottenberg. The doctor is a specialist on psychiatric paranormal abnormalities.<br />While waiting for his scheduled appointment, Jason takes a small detour to a local antique bookstore. There he discovers a book that looks to be a vintage edition of the star charts of Copernicus in 1520. Inside, a small sheet of something falls out showing the star map of the constellation of Cancer with the center star Praesepe, noted in detail. With Praesepe 525 light years away and spacecraft still only able to travel sub-light, it would take over a thousand years to get there and Jason can't understand why such a detailed map on a strange paper surface was hidden away inside the book.<br />In the same box the book came in, there is a metal amulet. Jason realizes that it is from his dream and once he touches it, he can't seem to let go of it. It as if the amulet and the book are linked together through him for some reason and he decides to buy both objects. The box they came in offers no information as to whom or where it came from since all it has on it is the address of the bookstore.<br />He makes his purchases and goes to meet with Dr. Gottenberg. Dr. Gottenberg seeks to analyze the dream as a possible portend of the future. Some of the elements of his dream are thought to be of good things, while other elements seem to describe some sort of great evil. The doctor asks him to return the next evening for some tests in the parapsychology lab so that his brain waves can be monitored in case he has the dream again. Jason agrees and goes back to his motel room for the evening.<br />He begins to examine the book and the amulet in great detail before falling asleep and plunging back into the dream. But, this time the dream is even more vivid and does not stop where it had always stopped before. Soon he learns that the dream is in fact real and he has transported across time and space to Praesepe.<br />What follows is a Flesh Gordon style work on the world of Praesepe with Jason living a life of danger and eroticism. He must save the Lady Charni and her people from the Evil Ones led by her brother, Khurami. Khurami has dark designs on her body and the help of various creatures in his attempt to capture her.  While fighting the good fight, along the way Jason experiences the pleasures of female slaves as well as an occasional lady in distress that he has to minister to in an hands on way to save her from the formidable powers of the Evil Ones.<br />The entire novel is spent on Praesepe with a very open ending, more so than one would expect of the first volume of a series. Furthermore, while my copy stated it was rated PG, I would rate it an R with very explicit scenes at times and descriptions of various topics, which can't be covered here. While heavy on the erotica at times and with an ending that is way too open in my opinion, overall this is a fairly enjoyable novel.

Deutermann	When a body falls from the roof of a six-story building and lands in a brick courtyard, there isn't going to be much left of the body. When Midshipman William Brian Dell takes a dive off of the roof of part of the United States Navel Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, not much of the body is left. But when what is left is clearly wearing women's panties the case becomes more than just a typical suicide. For about to graduate Midshipman Julie Markham her nightmare has begun. When Dell made his fatal plunge, he was wearing her panties and the powers that be want an explanation as to why.<br />The Academy's Administration known as the \\"Dark Side\\" (an uncomplimentary nickname reference to the Empire of the same name made cinematically famous) wants the case solved rapidly. Any death is a politically sensitive issue and with graduation just weeks away the case must be solved quickly. Murder does not happen ever, and a suicide is unacceptable because that would mean the selection process failed. No, the only correct answer is that it was an accident. Even if it was an accident, the panty question has to be answered and explained and if necessary, someone living has to be held accountable. Since he is dead and left no note and was wearing her panties, it is up to Julie to explain why he was wearing her panties. But she can't. And then small inconsistencies with Julie's statements appear and soon her father, Professor Ev Markham (former graduate of the academy) knowing how things will be perceived arranges for legal representation for his daughter. That does not sit well with the administration and the investigators because that is a civilian reaction and not one a military person should adopt. But Julie has not told the whole truth by a long stretch and slowly her case begins to weaken as the facts concerning her innocence come out.<br />At the same time, in a parallel story line, head of Security Jim Hall is dealing with someone that is playing havoc in the utility tunnels of the school. From spray-painting graffiti, to serious acts of vandalism and sabotage, to various attacks on people outside the school, someone is having a field day underground, coming and going as he or she pleases. When Jim pushes the issue and calls the person out, he or she responds by escalating the violence, which quickly results in a death. As the unknown individual begins to hunt Jim the underground battle turns personal with deadly consequences.<br />What should have been a good read with these two storylines quickly becomes a tedious reading exercise. A good 150 pages or so could have been excised from this 400-page novel, which would have been a considerable improvement. Much of the book is spent in long detailed character descriptions as well as long sections on the military honor code, civilian ignorance regarding all aspects of the military, and the like.  And both investigations go absolutely nowhere for long sections in the book. The investigations produce no new clues, suspects or any momentum at all. It is only because a freakishly contrived situation that the novel finally breaks free in the last 100 pages.<br />And while those last 100 pages are better than the first 300 preceding it, they continue the same problems. The reader knows these characters virtually inside and out thanks to the long descriptions and constantly shifting third person point of views but no emotional connection is ever established. That could be because of the fact that the author uses at least six different points of view (including the italicized point of view of the psychopath) which quickly becomes annoying. Or it could be because these characters for all their extensive descriptions never come across more human that the italicized psychopath. They simply never become real people to care about one way or the other.<br />This lack of emotional connection and distantness of the work leaves the reader with a flat and for the most part absolutely boring book that became atedious work to read. This is far from the enjoyment of some of his earlier novels such as \\"Sweepers\\" and more reflects the flat read of his first novel \\"Scorpion in the Sea.\\" Since this author has shown consistently over the course of his career, a certain roller coaster ability in quality regarding his novels, it can be hoped that future ones will be worth reading.tedious work to read.

If you have not had the pleasure of reading him, then you are in for a real treat. However, this is one of those series that it is vital to read them in order and this review will unfortunately, by necessity, give away some details.  The characters change tremendously in this series and this particular novel ties up quite a lot from the proceeding books. The earlier novels are Keeper, Finder, Smoker and Shooting at Midnight and should be available at almost any bookstore and of course, your local library, either in its collection or through the Inter-Library Loan Program.<br /> Atticus is virtually at the top of success in the professional bodyguard world. His company, KTMH Security, is doing very well especially after the success of stopping Drama in his last book. (See, I told you to read the others.) Drama, a world-renowned assassin in intelligence circles as well as the underworld had a violent encounter with Atticus and both were very lucky to escape with their respective lives. After a year and no retaliation by Drama, Atticus believes the threat has lessened and that one and all should breath easy. He believes that even though she was thwarted in her assignment at great personal cost, she has moved on to other targets.<br /> But, a book has been released, featuring reporting on the incident and there has been a resultant wave of publicity. While that has been good for business, it has brought the shallow celebrity style clients that Atticus does not want. But, there are clients that he does want and adores, such as Lady Ainsley-Hunter from England. Atticus agrees to protect her while her ladyship is in the United States and soon things begin to go wrong.<br /> Lady Ainsley-Hunter is in definite danger and it may all trace back to Drama. Drama has her own problems and is not through with either KTMH or its most famous owner and employee, Atticus Kodiak. She violently makes her presence known and with so much at stake, both professionally and personally, Atticus has no choice but to accede to her demands.<br />This is a tough, action filled and well written book that will keep you turning the page.

US	47265458	R1KTYZISVI4EYB	0446529931	265598858	Up Country	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Going Up Country with Nelson Demille	At forty-two old, I am not old enough to remember the Vietnam War, which is the subject of Nelson Demille's recent effort. My memories are tainted by hazy media images of newscasts and brief mentions in High School history classes right before the summer break. It wasn't until college when I was taking classes at night; I began to meet the occasional combat veteran who spoke, in passing, of the war and what really happened. The actual experiences of each Veteran I met far outweighed the plain text of the history book and were always incredibly moving.<br />That is the theme of this novel-explaining the past to himself and others. Nelson Demille served at various times in Vietnam including the horror of the Tet Offensive. That action becomes the backbone of the novel where Paul Brenner, now retired under questionable circumstances from the Army Criminal Investigation Division is asked to return to Vietnam to investigate a 30 year old murder. We last saw Paul Brenner in The General's Daughter (which was also made into a fairly decent movie of the same name starring John Travolta as Paul Brenner). He is still dealing with the fall out of that case and is rather at loose ends, professionally and personally.<br />His former boss, Colonel Karl Gustav Hellmann asks to meet him at the Vietnam Memorial. They both share a past in that horrible war and while picking out the names of their dead comrades in arms; Karl begins to slowly explain why he wanted a meet.<br />\\"Finally, Karl said, `There is a name on this wall of a man who was not killed in action. A man, who was, in fact murdered.'\\" Additionally, \\"'Regarding this American Lieutenant, we have evidence that he was murdered by an American Army Captain.'\\"<br />The evidence is a letter that another Vietnam Vet took off a dead Viet Cong Soldier some thirty years ago, along with some other souvenirs. The letter was written by the dead man's brother who claims to have witnessed the murder. This man, a murder witness, might still be alive somewhere in Vietnam and Karl wants Paul to got and investigate the case. They even have a location for the man, but Paul is aware that he is not being told even half of the real story. But Paul, for various reasons not entirely clear to himself, agrees to make one more journey to Vietnam for the United States Government.<br />Once in Saigon, now officially Ho Chi Minh City, he meets with Susan Weber. Ostensibly, Susan Weber is nothing more than an American Expatriate who is to help Paul by making him aware of current customs in Vietnam as well as translating the language. But, Paul soon figures out that she is another part on an increasingly more difficult puzzle as he begins to follow the trail.<br />This is a far different novel than the thrillers Mr. Demille has penned in the past. Instead, this is an extensive travel log as Mr. Demille recounts various battle scenes from his past and others in Vietnam. The novel is full of long scenes of Paul Brenner staring at rice paddies and former battle sites, detailing the horrors seen in combat. At 1170 pages in large print, the reader eventually longs for the action that one is used to in a Nelson Demille novel.<br />Unfortunately, the action for the most part is limited to approximately two hundred pages total, split about evenly between the very beginning and the end. And even though the action picks up drastically towards the end of the novel, the last few pages reveal a very weak and unsatisfactory ending. While this is a good opportunity for Mr. Demille to evolve the character further in another novel, after spending some much time reading this work, it would have been nice to tie up just a few pieces of the puzzle. Instead, the reader is left with some vague hints and the feeling that one has been exposed to a very long and painful cathartic release for Mr. Demille in the form of a novel. Accepted in that spirit, is a very detailed and well-written complex work, driven almost entirely by character painand development. Just don't expect a lot of action, the hallmark of Mr. Demille's other enjoyable works.and development.

US	47265458	R3CJGJ2Z2M9AFD	B00008RWC0	622113275	The Cabinet of Curiosities (Pendergast, Book 3	Books	2	7	9	N	N	Don't Open The Cabinet of Curiosities	In the past, I have thoroughly enjoyed the novels co-written by both of these authors. The books have featured extremely complicated plots with historical roots, tight writing, intriguing characters and plenty of intense action. The same could be said for this offering but it would not be accurate on several fronts.<br />Like their other books, this novel features an extremely complicated plot. With the understanding that I am not doing justice to their plot and simply can't because of space limitations and other problems; the book revolves around private museums of the 1880's that were located in New York City. Those early and primitive (for the most part) museums were known as \\"cabinets of curiosities\\" and for a small fee allowed visitors to look at various objects from around the world. Many of the objects were fake but some were actually what they were purported to be. With the opening of what would become the New York Museum of Natural History, which allowed visitors in for free as required by its charter, the cabinets began to disappear with the museum buying the various collections.<br />Beneath a building that once housed one of the more famous cabinets, work crews have broken into an underground nightmare. The bodies of 36 people have been found who were killed and dismembered over 130 years ago. Special Agent Pendergast of the FBI asks Dr. Nora Kelly, a Museum archeologist to help survey the crime scene and assist with the case. Their time at the scene is very limited and soon both are booted from the site thanks to the internal politics of New York. Dr. Kelly does not share Agent Pendergast's obsession with the case and does not appreciate the fact that her limited involvement as well as other factors have pushed her job into jeopardy.<br />Disgusted by the museum's internal politics as well as Pendergast's heavy pressure on her to identify a killer that may have in fact killed far more than 36 so long ago, Dr. Kelly resumes work on the case. Soon, it becomes apparent that the victims were selected for their age and in each case had most, if not all of their spinal columns removed apparently by a mad man trying to find the secret ingredient to increase a person's lifespan. Her efforts become more urgent as soon the killings begin again with the acts of a copycat killer who is duplicating what happened in gruesome detail so long ago.<br />While the last fourth of this novel is quite intense and has some downright nerve wracking action, the approximately over three hundred pages before are too often slow and boring. The read is rather flat, which is surprising for these authors and only at the end, do the characters seem to come remotely alive. Part of this flat read is due to the fact that the reader is forced to wait for long stretches for anything to happen amid the vast historical lessons between any event no matter how minuet. Simply removing the detailed historical lessons would cut down this book nearly in half.<br />The other major problem with the novel is that too often it degenerates into the typical run of the mill serial killer novel. Far too often for my taste, the reader is treated to being in the mind of the killer as he stalks his next victim. Of course, the killer is killing for a lofty reason (don't they all?) and of course, the victim has no more presence of his or her surroundings than some character in the latest slasher movie.<br />This novel until the last 100 pages or so is a slow moving very detailed affair that finally explodes with a very good ending. But, taken as a whole, it does not live up to its potential or the past novels by this team. Since every author is guaranteed to have a bad book or two, if this is as bad as it gets, the next one should be back to form and be something worth reading.omes apparent that the victims were selected for their age and in each case had most, if not all of their spinal columns removed apparently by a mad man trying to find the secret ingredient to increase a person's lifespan.

US	47265458	R2NW4524S96LKD	B0000W6SWC	255226197	The Short Forever	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Studly Stone in The Short Forever by Staurt Woods	When the annoying trend of product placement, which has been annoyingly prevelant in movies, finally makes it full-scale to books, Stuart Woods will be in the forefront cashing the checks. His suave and sophisticated character Stone Barrington never drops into the local fast food joint for a burger like the rest of us. Instead, he is having fillet of sole with a nice red wine in an upscale restaurant. If forced to pay, he signs the check with his Mount Blanc pen before driving off with the beautiful woman (every woman wants to be in bed with him putting it politely) in an Austin Martin touring car. Later, he will jump on the Concorde or current equivalent, before doing whatever his client needs him to do, to be followed by splitting another bottle of champagne and dancing with another lovely woman.<br />Following on the heels of his novel Cold Paradise, the studly Stone is back in The Short Forever. As I have noted before, if you haven't read the last several Stuart Woods novels featuring Stone Barrington, then please skip the rest of the review after this paragraph. This novel refers to the previous novel as well as some things in earlier works. Ideally, if you haven't read the works containing Stone, then you should start with the first, New York Dead. However, if that isn't possible, then you should work your way forward from Dead In The Water.<br />If you are still reading, you have been warned. This latest adventure finds Stone just weeks after the conclusion of Cold Paradise. Within a matter of pages as this quick read starts, Callie informs Stone that she is dumping him as well as suddenly marrying Thad James. She has decided that while Stone is great in bed, he just can't give her what she needs, financially or emotionally. Stone is pretty well off financially and one would think that by now, since he has heard this before, he would be used to it. But, he isn't and he is rather upset.<br />However, before he has too much time to self reflect (which would not take too long as these still waters are very shallow) he receives an urgent call from Bill Eggers. \\"Bill was the managing partner of Woodman & Weld, the prestigious law firm for which Stone did unprestigious jobs.\\" Basically, a glorified troubleshooter for the messy things that the rich involve themselves in from time to time. Bill says that a man will come see Stone the next morning and Stone is to do whatever the man wants.<br />The next morning, John Bartholomew arrives and sits down with Stone at his home. John tells him a story involving his niece Erica Burroughs. She is in London and has suddenly dropped out of school and has involved herself with Lance Cabot, but he is not of the Massachusetts's Cabot's. That is his first strike against him as far as John is concerned. But John is more concerned as he believes Lance is smuggling small quantities of drugs into England and he wants Stone to get Erica away from him and at the same time, find a way to put Lance in jail that does not involve Erica. He will finance Stone's efforts and Stone, once he thinks he has all the facts, agrees to handle the problem. But soon, after arriving in London via the Concorde, he fins out that things are nowhere near what they appear to be.<br />Like most of the other books in the series, this one is extremely short on character development. Stone hardly ever contemplates his own life, the mistakes he has made, and his future. This is not a character one would ever find sitting on a porch somewhere at two in the morning wondering how the heck he had screwed up things so royally. Instead, he moves from beautiful woman's bed to beautiful woman's bed, occasionally roughed up by thugs, and always eating and drinking at the best places. Clearly, it is the good life one hears about.<br />However, this particular novel is considerably better than the last several. The plot is very complicated and there are several twists and turns to it all the way to the end. Like most of the others in the series, this effort is action based and as such, this one seems to have more action than normal in it. Also, as I have warned before, graphic sex is a common occurrence in a Stone Barrington novel. While several practices are hinted at different times in the novel, there are also several explicit and detailed scenes, which may offend some readers.<br />While it is a typical Stone Barrington novel, this one is better than most. Stuart Woods does not plow any new ground here with these characters in the terms of development, but there is quite a lot more action in this novel.  This novel is an improvement as far as plot design and action upon the previous novel, Cold Paradise. Hopefully, this is a sign that Mr. Woods has turned away from the speedy production he has generated the last few years and will once again turn out the quality work that marked his earliest work. This one is a definite improvement and a pretty good read.he series, this effort is action based and as such, this one seems to have more action than normal in it.

Guilt By Emma Kaufmann	The varied and complex themes of jealousy, guilt and mental illness (diagnosed and undiagnosed) drive this offering from author Emma Kaufmann. This novel chronicles in great detail a group of psychologically dysfunctional self-obsessed individuals who inevitably cause each other and themselves incredible levels of emotional as well as physical pain. Like moths to a flame, each one of these individuals is drawn back and back again to the group and is burned over and over again.<br />Watching over the moths with no more interest than a scientist watching a blade of grass grow is the Dr. Gerber. The inhuman Dr. Gerber has \\"treated\\" (if one can use that term in regards to his work in this novel) several of the group and therefore knows all of them in one sense or the other. Dr. Gerber is a fairly reprehensible human being and certainly worthless as a therapist. People are not people to him with real feelings, but instead are case studies for him to test his psychology theories and to write about in his books. Once he has used them for that purpose, he wants nothing more to do with them. Or as he laments at one point in the novel,<br />\\"'What on earth possessed Clive to trail me all evening, to force his inconsequential little problems on me? Don't any of them realize that once I deem their therapy complete, that's the end of the matter?'\\"<br />What seems as inconsequential to Dr. Gerber might be a sign of a raving psychotic beginning to crack to the reader and certainly to any layman that wandered near.  But Clive isn't the only one with major problems as they all have major problems. However, the biggest problem, other than the obvious slow mental unraveling of Clive, might be Dora's situation. Dora is pregnant (this was not planned) and while she would like to confide in her mother, Gilda, and desperately needs to, she can't. Not only is their a tremendous emotional distance between mother and daughter, Gilda is off in America promoting her latest pop psychology self help book. So with Gilda unreachable on any level, Dora begins to confide in Clive and the other intertwined characters. In so doing, she unwittingly triggers quite a number of painful memories of other events for various characters as well as present day murder, deceit and betrayal.<br />Reminiscent of a traditional literary style work with limited action, this novel becomes primarily a case study of some very emotionally damaged people. Survival is paramount and each one copes as best as she or he can, while rationalizing the pain they inflict on others. In many instances, each character has no idea how to relate to the others and is unaware of the further infliction of damage they cause. In other cases, the character is fully aware and simply does not know how to act any differently. Overlying everything else is the continuing reinforcement of the theme of guilt and how one never gets away from the past.help book.

That is definitely true in this intriguing collection by Annette Gisby. Consisting of eleven short stories and a twelfth story that is novella in length, this collection provides some interesting and occasionally, very disturbing reading. Almost in all cases, mature themes are covered and this collection is intended for adults.<br />Almost every story has a strange twist to it with many of the twists having to do what could be considered the supernatural. However, in this case, I would not refer to these twists as being related to the supernatural but more like having to do with something beyond this plane of existence. In the context of the story as written, the events that happen are not of a supernatural bent, but more just out of the norm for those of us in this realm. In the story times and places, such events are common and expected.<br />Out of the whole group, my favorite story is \\"Witch Hunter.\\" In this story, set in the far distant past, Lady Katherine has been accused of being a witch and thrown into a dungeon by Sir Robert. With the death of her father just two days ago, he means to take over her lands as well as anything else he can of hers. But his plans are interrupted by his fall off of his horse. Thanks to his unlordly tumble, one arm has been gravely injured and reeks of  \\"the rotting sickness.\\"<br />While she is not a witch, she is a healer. Desperate, he seeks her help and she does. He loses the afflicted limb but does not lose her life. Despite her help, he still means to try her in the presence of the witch hunter for being a witch. But the witch hunter has his own plans for her.<br />While I enjoyed most of the collection, several of the stories were very disturbing and I did not care for them. In particular \\"Baby Blue\\" which deals with the unintended repercussions of gene control and deformed babies in the future. It was not an easy story to read or topic to deal with.<br />While this collection does feature plenty of interesting characters and strong writing, it also does feature mature content and is definitely not suitable for non-adults. Many of the stories, while dealing with adult themes, offer somewhat graphic descriptions of human relations with little left to the imagination. Clearly such scenes are not gratuitous or added to shock the reader when the story is taken in context, but serve to further detail the actions of the characters.<br />All in all, while often not light reading, this is an interesting work. The characters are complex and human, the predicaments all to real in many cases, and the writing is well done. With a combination of themes and issues, this is an intriguing collection and well worth your time as a reader.to read or topic to deal with.<br />While this collection does feature plenty of interesting characters and strong writing, it also does feature mature content and is definitely not suitable for non-adults.

Visit UTOPIA (by Lincoln Child)	If you are old enough, you may remember a movie named Westworld as well as the sequel. In the movie, a theme park had been created allowing park visitors to experience the past thanks to fully functioning state of the art robots. Robots so real that they passed for human. Everything worked wonderfully and the park was a success until the robots started malfunctioning, attacking and killing guests.<br />If Lincoln Child had stopped there with his idea of the novel \\"UTOPIA\\" the book would have been nothing more than an average read. While he did use the idea and often seems to be making homage to the past, he also added a modern day problem in the shape of terrorists. Terrorists that manage to take over the park with none of the guests being wiser in an effort to extort millions of dollars and state of the art technology. Add in a love interest and a couple of other plot goodies and Lincoln Child shows once again while he is so very good in the thriller genre.<br />Built in a rugged canyon in Nevada, Utopia is a state of the art theme park. Featuring four worlds with a fifth under construction, each depicts a different place and time as realistically as possible while providing thrilling rides for those so inclined. Using the latest in technology, including machine learning where robots learn from their environment and adapt, the park is incredibly successful. But the system is beginning to sporadically break down and when no one on staff can explain why robots and safety systems are malfunctioning, the original designer Dr. Andrew Warne is brought back in to fix the problems.<br />But Dr. Warne arrives a week early and on the same day that a band of terrorists have infiltrated the park. They are the ones that control the park's highly advanced computer system and prove it by making what they want to malfunction do it when they want to. While nearly all of the 65,000 visitors have no idea anything is a miss, Dr. Warne and a few others know and begin a desperate race against time trying to save the park and lives.<br />While not on the level with \\"The Ice Limit\\" or \\"Relic\\" both of which he co-wrote with Douglas Preston, this is an enjoyable novel. It does feature a large cast of characters and as time slips by minute by minute, annoyingly as most disaster style books do, the read drops into various points of view. Not only does it shift between various members of the group trying to stop the catastrophe in the making as well as the various terrorists, it also shifts into the pov of the victims to depict their fun changing into terror. At times it becomes a bit over the top and reminds one of a movie of the week, as their terror does nothing to advance the actual storyline. As a reader, we know bad things are going to happen and will happen and the pov shifts are the equivalent of being beaten over the head with a baseball bat to make the point. Such diversions involving for the most part, incredibly stereotypical characters, is gratuitous at best.<br />One such diversion does even more damage by creating a storyline hole, as a situation around a family of one of the minor characters is never addressed despite being extensively implied. The character, having received a frantic call from one of his family member's rushes off in a panic. He reappears twenty pages later or so with no explanation as to what happened to his family and while occasionally someone vaguely implies something happened, their fate is unknown and unresolved.<br />While everything for the main characters are resolved, like the minor characters, they too are stereotypical. But like most thrillers or adventure novels, which this one certainly is, what is lacking in character development is more than made up by intense action featuring sheer chase and adventure. As such, it more than meets expectations for what it is and that makes this one a worthwhile read.gainst time trying to save the park and lives.<br />While not on the level with \\"The Ice Limit\\" or \\"Relic\\" both of which he co-wrote with Douglas Preston, this is an enjoyable novel.

As the author is quoted on the back cover, \\"These SPIRIT books were written to inspire those who are abused to seize control, to use their collective power to put teeth into our laws.\\" Seizing control is certainly the main theme of the work as an abused woman seeks revenge on men to make up for the abuse of her parents and the rape, battery and ultimately death of her best friend.<br />From multiple points of view and perspectives, along with numerous flashbacks and dreams, the story of a killer and his stalking of his next victim unfolds in this extremely graphic and violent novel. Lynn and Elsie had been friends since childhood eventually rooming together, before Elsie comes home to find her best friend savagely beaten, raped, mutilated and killed. The room is soaked in blood and what is left, is barely recognizable as to being human before death. Elsie suffers what apparently is a mental breakdown before pulling herself together with one thought in mind. She knows the justice system and specifically a detective Gerald Lawrence who wants to help, but can't. That isn't good enough and it will not satisfy her inner need for justice.<br />All she knows is that Lynn called him Peter and she begins a hunt for Peter. Eventually, she identifies him and begins to stalk him just as he did to Lynn. While Peter is aware of her presence, he is not aware of who really is or what she has in mind for him. At the same time, she begins to stalk other men for her own purposes and needs.<br />While Detective Lawrence, known to one and all by a shortened version of his name \\"Law\\" works the death of Lynn he also has another problem. A suspect is going around and killing men, before removing their male sexual organ and running it down the garbage disposal. The case is generating media attention and he has to find the assailant named as \\"Bite-Woman.\\" While Elsie focuses the rage of childhood abuse along with the murder of her best friend into an all encompassing mission for revenge, Law is haunted by the memories of the dead and the need to solve the cases and save Elsie from her own inner demons.<br />This is a vengeance novel pure and simple on men everywhere and those that allow abuse to happen. It is well written for what it is and is extremely graphic and disturbing. As stated on the back cover along with the author's quote referenced above, \\"Text contains graphic violence, sex, and language.\\" That warning could not be made strong enough, as this novel is one of the harshest I have ever had the pleasure to read. At the same time, it is clearly not written to serve as reading pleasure or for me to enjoy. Instead it is more of a clarion call for women to stop the cycle of abuse.

This is one that I personally could have done without.<br />As the novel opens, Madriani is attempting to defend Dr. David Crone, a highly respected genetic researcher from murder charges. He is charged with killing coworker Kalista Jordan, a twenty six year old research physician and colleague, who worked under him at the lab funded by the local university. Kalista was skilled at office politics and played hard. She had filed a sexual harassment claim against him after stealing some of his research papers. He wanted them back and she wanted more funding for her portion of the project. After being seen publicly arguing with her, her dismembered body washes up out of the ocean. Not only does he seem to have motive for killing her, Forensics links items in his garage to the killing.<br />With such evidence against him, Dr. Crone won't cooperate with his own defense. Many avenues of investigation remain closed, as Dr. Crone won't discuss the highly technical research he was working on or what Kalista's role in the research was. All he knows is that it was something at the forefront of genetics research and implications could be staggering. Madriani becomes increasingly frustrated as the case goes against him and the Doctor remains oblivious to the situation.<br />The only reason he is defending the Doctor is that the Doctor was the only person helping the ill friend of his daughter.  Penny Boyd has Huntington Chorea, a rare hereditary disease that attacks the brain and central nervous system. Over time, it destroys brain tissue, causes the loss of the ability to control the muscles and finally, death. While it rarely attacks children, Penny has it and is wasting away before her family and Madriani's eyes. Madriani tried everyone and everything to help her and the only one that helped in anyway, was Dr. Crone. As part of his research, Dr. Crone was trying to get Penny into a drug trial program when he was arrested for murder. Now on leave from the university, and removed from heading the program, his life is at stake as well as Penny's.<br />I admit that my review maybe somewhat biased against this book.

She had always wanted to be a doctor but because of personal and financial reasons she never made it to medical school. She is at the proverbial fork in the road with the choices limited to going to med school or staying put as a registered nurse when suddenly an unexpected third option arises. She is offered a position as a pacemaker rep, which would use her medical training as well as provide a possible high source of income.<br />She accepts the initial position and soon finds herself dealing with office politics and sexism. Slowly but steadily, she builds her territory depite these obstacles as well as dealing with sexual innuendo in regards to how she is building her business. Over the next eight years, which is detailed quite heavily in the book, the abuse steadily worsens as her income and business share increases. At the same time, she begins to learn of deaths in the medical community as well as having a couple of near misses herself which she believes is all the work of one killer. The police don't agree and long after her pacemaker representative career is over the killer goes after her in a dark hospital room to finish the job once and fore all.<br />This is a first novel for this author according to the promotional copy and as such certain allowances have to be made. However, beyond the clich&eacute;d writing at times, there is a certain lack of balance to the characters. While billed as a novel of suspense, this book is primarily a novel of office politics with limited character development. The killer, which is shown through his point of view, is regulated to a background storyline for most of this book and only towards the very end does he resume his place as a primary storyline.<br />Megan, the heroine is almost portrayed saint like in a David v. Goliath situation where she is always ethical, does her best, and succeeds depite the efforts of the evil men around her. Other than her relationship with Dallas (her physician boyfriend and then husband as the years pass) almost every single male figure in this novel is scum. The men are portrayed as adulterers, sex fiends of various types, drug and alcohol fiends, racists, sexists and everything else possible with some having all the above traits in one character. Some of the male characters are a bit better and just have a couple of the traits. This is true of the Doctors, the pacemaker executives as well as her fellow reps. In other words; men are unbelievable scum, which is an insult to scum everywhere.<br />While the working environment may in fact be exactly as it is portrayed, it would be more believable if she had used some of her vast experience to add a couple of decent strong male characters. Instead, with the constant stream of disgusting male behavior as well as comments about the sanctity of life (or lack of same) it begins to read as a commentary indictment rant of almost everyone she ever worked with while the author was a pacemaker rep.<br />The other major problem with this book is that the author feels the need to show off her degrees and language skills. The author has degrees in Nursing, Psychology, Creative Writing, and Biology in addition to her PhD in Psychology.  That may explain why narration is portrayed such as:<br />\\"After peeking around the opening and seeing no one, she slinked her way back beyond a bench pinched between two rows of matching lockers to an aperture baring a small dictation area emitting bedroom susurrations.\\"<br />Dialogue is often written the same way or in such a way that one can't comprehend someone in real life speaking that way. For example,<br />\\"If Garret was flinging water balloons, the one that hit Megan contained caustic soda. She was stinging. `You know, Garrett,' Megan said. `I resent your insinuations and accusations.They're outright diabolical lies only someone as nefarious as you would dare utter. But, I'm your virus, Garrett. One that's not only potent, but chronic. And no matter how earnest and fierce your attempts to eradicate me are, I'll keep infiltrating and attacking. And just when you think you've wiped me out, I'll mutate impressively, then zap you even more aggressively, you got that?\\"<br />Not only does that make me think of a bronchitis infection I had a few years back all winter, but it does not sound like anything anyone in real life would say. While these are two small examples, such over writing runs rampant throughout the novel as the author shows a penchant for using complicated words and phraseology when simplification would work better.<br />Despite its problems, this novel does hold reader interest. She portrays an industry where the patient comes a far second to the pursuit of money no matter the cost. For those of us with chronic and permanent debilitating health problems, this isn't surprising. At the same time, if even half the stuff depicted in this thinly disguised novel actually happened, it becomes a call to action to clean up the medical sales industry as well as the medical profession itself.<br />Overall, despite its problems, this is a fairly enjoyable novel.

I'm not at all sure what the problem is and it may very well say more about me, than the author. As in his previous books, Big Easy, and Green-eyed Hurricane, Mr. Hegwood populates this novel with a cast of eccentric southerners and plenty of beautiful descriptions of scenery in the style of James Lee Burke. In between, along the way a murder or two coupled with plenty of observations about life are thrown in to pass the time. What comes out is a slow moving mystery with over half the book being an extended flashback and an amazingly convoluted story line.<br />Summarizing greatly, Jack Delmas is a private investigator still harboring bitterness over his divorce from Susan. Susan decided she didn't want to be married to someone who wasn't willing to work in her father's bank forever, worrying about the latest society pecking order, so she took their daughter and went home to Memphis. Six years later, Jack rarely gets to see his daughter Peyton and it is during her two-week summer visit that he becomes involved in his latest case.<br />Jack lives near Dauphin Island, Alabama, once known as Massacre Island for good reason. There has been a modern day massacre and the networks are camped out everywhere to cover the death and faltering police investigation. Four young people are dead in Jason Summers's beach house, counting Jason. The investigation is going nowhere as the victims are violated again by the media. The mother of one of the dead victims, Carolyn Jordan, hires Jack not to find the killer, but to clear her daughter, Rebecca, of any wrongdoing that led up to her death.<br />Jack agrees and soon is deep into a very murky case along with the reader. The biggest problem with this book is an extended single flashback sequence that goes on for more than one hundred pages. The way it is written, it is not clear that the reader is going into a flashback for at least thirty pages after it starts. Since I am not a fan of flashbacks and prefer a more straightforward story, this was not appreciated.<br />While Mr. Hegwood's descriptions of scene are very good, and his characters are eccentric and definitely interesting, this novel seems to be bit flat overall. That coupled with the aforementioned flashback issue leads me to categorize this as an average read, at best. But, at the same time, I must confess that I will be right there in line waiting to read his next one.s after it starts.

As the novel opens, a killer has managed to kill thirteen people inside a restaurant in order to confuse the police over who was his actual intended victim. But, ex-cop and now Criminology Professor Daniel Millikan is invited in to the crime scene by the local police and quickly figures out who the target was. Robert Cushner was the intended target and the killer killed everyone around not only to confuse the issue but also to prove that he could do it and get away with it.<br />Professor Millikan soon flies home to Los Angles from Louisville after helping the Police all he can to find this special unfeeling professional killer. But, after the Police prove that they can't, the son's father, also going by the name of Robert Cushner contacts Millikan. The boy's father is wondering if Millikan can put him in touch with someone who might be able, not to get justice and bring the killer to trial, but to seek vengeance and make sure this never happens again. Millikan knows such a man and his name is Prescott.<br />Prescott takes the job, because that is what he does for a living. Prescott begins an elaborate chess game with the killer and soon other people are dying as Prescott and the killer each try to prove his manhood. Neither wants to admit the possibility that the other is better or going to win the game of death. An elaborate chase across the country and back again, weaves through this 370-page novel leaving a trail of bodies in its wake.<br />This is an extremely flat book where there is virtually no emotion coming through the work. These cardboard characters emote through various descriptions but at such distance from the reader that it never comes through. What does come through is the fact that there is little difference between the two and virtually no feelings over the steadily rising body count as Prescott baits the killer over and over again. This novel becomes an extremely boring piece of work and a real disappointment to this Thomas Perry fan. Fortunately, he has written some very good stuff in the past so check out some of his older titles and take a wide pass on this one.aits the killer over and over again.

The final scene, with Heston screaming on the sea shore at the Statue of Liberty made a tremendous impression on me then and now, ranking right at the top in all time incredible scenes. But, I had never read the book, thinking that it was just a novelization of the movie. Thanks to the release of the new movie, which was okay at best in my opinion, the original book was also released again and I was able to get a copy through my local library.<br />In a future time, a couple is taking a vacation in deep space under solar sail. Adrift, with no destination planned, they find a bottle containing a journal of sorts. One immediately thinks of the idea of castaways throwing their messages in bottles to the sea for possible discovery. A record of what they have seen and done, should the individuals not survive.  The journal is unfurled and the couple settles back for the read.<br />The journal begins in the year 2500 on Earth. \\"I am confiding this manuscript to space, not with the intention of saving myself, but to help, perhaps, to avert the appalling scourge that is menacing the human race. Lord have pity on us.\\" The writer is Ulysse Merou and he was a journalist. He was one of three launched on the first interstellar flight and like his apparent namesake, has been on a long and tragic quest.<br />They were to explore the region surrounding Betelgeuse (Alpha Orion) around three hundred light years from our planet.  Professor Antelle made the decision after supervising the project from the beginning. Also along is the Professor's disciple Arthur Levain who is a young physician. The two-year journey goes relatively smoothly and soon they find themselves close to the red sun, Betelgeuse.<br />The professor quickly finds four planets in rotation around the sun, one of which seems to be relatively Earth like for this system. The decision is made to go there, using one of the launches. There are three aboard the main craft and being smaller, are designed for excursions to planetary surfaces. With their ship remaining in orbit, the three adventurers go down to the surface. During the landing sequence their flight takes them over a small town and they quickly realize that the world is inhabited.<br />They land far from the town and go exploring. The planet is virtually identical to Earth in almost every respect and they decide that it should be named. They name it Soror and begin to explore it with their pet monkey, Hector. They soon find a small pool and a waterfall and human tracks in the soil on the banks of the pool.<br />They go for a swim and soon they see someone watching from the cliffs above. It is a young and very lovely naked woman who acts more like an animal than human. It quickly becomes clear that she is an animal, beautiful in a sensual way, but still an animal. Ulysse feels an attraction for her and leads the group back to the pool the next day.<br />This becomes a mistake as the group is seized by the rest of the woman's companions. The expedition is stripped, their vehicle plundered and destroyed, before being marched to the savages camp. There they are fed and begin to adjust to life as prisoners while plotting their escape. Ulysse decides to name the woman Nova and begins to try to teach her a few things such as his name.<br />The teaching is interrupted when panic sets in among the group. Bugles are heard and the bushes are beaten to flush them out as unknown forces attack them. Running through a gauntlet, Ulysse is separated from his companions and captured by Gorillas. Gorillas that walk, talk, ride horses, and act like Englishmen on a hunt, round up all the survivors and take them to town.<br />There begins a rude indoctrination as Ulysse is forced to confront a world where Mankind is not the superior race it believes itself to be on Earth. This is a world where humans are savages, and are the ones subject to extermination or experimentation. Ulysse must confront his own notions of society and civilization as well as his eventual leadership of the caged humans as he is the only one that can talk and think.<br />This book is certainly is a much different version that the movie versions. The writing is stilted at times in the way a lot of classic science fiction will read today. At the same time, the writing is vivid and the author manages to inject observations that are still valid today as when the novel was written.

There was and has been simply no one better when he was on at crafting a complex conspiracy and the fate of the world hanging in the balance. When it was assumed that there would be an ending to the spy thrillers after the cold war ended, Ludlum just changed them slightly and weaved stories of demonic corporations ruled by greedy power moguls manipulating world governments. With his novels firmly rooted in reality, one always wonders just how much is real and how much is fiction. Simply put, he has done it again in fine form.<br />As the novel opens, Ben Hartman is walking the streets of Zurich, Switzerland. After the death of his brother, Peter, Ben was forced into the family business and to take up the legacy of his father's company, Hartman Capital Management. Ben hates investment banking and is bored out of his mind.<br />His boredom is shattered when he sees his old friend Jimmy Cavanaugh whom, he has known since his sophomore year at Princeton. Ben hasn't seen him in years, but there is no mistake and Jimmy also recognizes him, offering a big smile of his own. At the same time, Jimmy pulls out a weapon and opens fire on Ben, narrowly missing him. The chase is on through the cold streets as Ben tries to flee an old friend, who while trying to kill him is indiscriminately shooting innocent people on the streets.<br />At the same time, half a world away, Agent Anna Navarro of the Justice Department is having her own problems. She works in the office of Special Investigations under the incompetent supervision of Arliss Dupree. Like petty bureaucrats everywhere, he wields the little authority he has in an attempt to get even with some of the staff. He surrounds himself with toadies and since Anna isn't part of the \\"in\\" crowd, he singles her out for cheap shots. The fact that she is extremely good at what she does, in addition to refusing to sleep with him or go out drinking with the boys, just bugs him all the more. It also brings her to the attention of Alan Bartlett of the Internal Compliance Unite. This is a super secret group that handles internal governmental investigations that individual departments can't, for whatever reason. Bartlett wants her and this annoys Dupree even further.<br />Anna reports to Bartlett and gets an extremely murky assignment. Bartlett wants her to investigate eleven suspicious deaths. The eleven are all elderly and died of what appears to be natural causes. The only link that has been discovered is that each man had the word \\"Sigma\\" reference in his files but there is no record of what Sigma was supposed to be. The files date back to the 40's under the OSS, the precursor to the CIA. The men were investigated and cleared for some operation, but what?<br />The eleven men have all died in an incredibly short period of time and Bartlett wants to know why as well as what Sigma was. Anna is aware that she is not getting the full story and Bartlett knows more than he is letting on, but she has been assigned to him and this case and she has no choice in the matter.<br />Ludlum weaves these two separate storylines together in a complex and fascinating thriller. The characters are deep and intriguing and the premise becomes increasingly more complicated with tentacles that stretch from the 40's until present day. Once again, Ludlum blurs the line between fiction and fact and it makes for a very enjoyable read. At 535 pages, it will not be a very fast read, but it is well worth the time and effort to read this one. This reads like vintage Ludlum, before the Covert One series and his more recent shallow books. Enjoy!.

Very simplistic usually, they are guaranteed to have lots of action and minimal plot twists. Evil is usually just that, evil. No moralizing or explanation as to why the evil is evil, it just is and must be eradicated. Like any Steven Segal movie, these novels have their place. Sometimes you just want to sit back and read and know that the good guys will in all likelihood, save the day and maybe the fair maiden in distress. Sometimes, not thinking is good.<br />The usual is true of this effort by Robert B. Parker. Spenser is far a field from his hometown of Boston, as he has been in the last several novels.  This time, like many a \\"B\\" western on any late night cable channel, Spenser is called in to save the town and protect the fair maiden.<br />Potshot, Arizona is a mall town catering to the new class that drives the American West, Yuppies. They have come, bought up the town, and at least some of them have plans to get rich any way they can. But, up in the old mining camp above the town lurks a gang of toughs of various stripes known as the Dell. The Dell is led by a charismatic figure known as The Preacher. The Preacher has organized the group and focused their energies on collecting protection monies from the town merchants.<br />There was resistance to the protection payments and Steve Buckman led the resistance. Steve and the his wife (who would be the required fair maiden) Mary Lou Buckman ran a small outdoor day tour service. Steve is threatened publicly by the Dell with death and soon is dead in the middle of dusty Main Street with no witnesses. May Lou knows the Dell did it, she just isn't sure which one and hires Spenser to find the killer.<br />Spenser first scouts out the situation and then recruits Hawk and all the usual suspects as he investigates the case. High Noon this is not, but the allusions to it are thick and heavy throughout this approximately 300-page hardback novel. This is Robert B. Parker at his usual smirking best and as such, can be an entertaining read, if so inclined. Long time Spenser fans will not be disappointed as the tradition continues.obert B.

They may have their place, where appropriate, but a nice, clean old-fashioned adventure is more to my liking for my kids. So, Kathleen Culligan Techler's book was like a breath of fresh air for this parent.<br />As the story opens, a very homesick Adria Miller is on the small isle of Pirate's Key, located off the coast of Florida. She will be staying with Uncle Paul, Aunt Jean and Cousin Toby for two weeks while her parents complete the move to St. Petersburg from Minnesota. Uncle Paul, Aunt Jean and Cousin Toby are also living in St. Petersburg, but have come to the island because Uncle Paul, a building contractor, has been hired to build a house on the island.<br />Cousin Toby, like many young boys (and quite a few of us old boys as well) is very interested in Pirates and their treasure. The kids get the idea to start searching for treasure that may have well been hidden on the island by Pirates during their travels. While Cousin Toby wants the loot for the sheer pleasure of finding it, Adria believes that found treasure would allow her father to quit his job. Once free of his job, they could move back to Minnesota.<br />The hunt takes on a greater urgency when Adria spies a Pirate ship disappearing into a fog bank early one morning. As their search leads them to explore the small island, they meet numerous interesting characters, some of which seem to have possibly sinister motives. The trail twists and turns to a very satisfying and surprising conclusion.<br />This is a very good novel and an excellent read for children of almost all ages. Younger children will like hearing it, while older children will enjoy reading it themselves. There is virtually no physical violence and there are not any deep, dark thorny moral issues to discuss with the kids later. Just a plain old adventure told in a good clean fun style often not found in today's market. This was a real pleasure to read and hopefully not the last youth novel from Kathleen Culligan Techler.told in a good clean fun style often not found in today's market.

In this serial novel written to benefit Breast Cancer Research, Marcia Talley brought together thirteen female mystery authors together to create a serial novel. The thirteen authors are: Nevada Barr, Nora Roberts, Nancy Pickard, Lisa Scottoline, Perri O'Shaughnessy, J. A. Jance, Faye Kellerman, Mary Jane Clark, Anne Perry, Diana Gabaldon, Val McDermid, Laurie R. King and the editor herself, Marcia Talley, who also adds a chapter. With that much talent and totally different writing styles and perceptions involved, I expected a choppy, uneven novel. While that does happen in a couple of places, overall the merge is very good with plenty of surprising twists and turns to keep the reader guessing all the way to the end.<br />The novel opens with quite a cast of characters that have brought to the very upscale Phoenix Spa in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Featured front and center is Caroline Blessing, the young wife of a recently elected congressman and her overpowering mother, Hilda Finch. Two weeks earlier, Caroline's father, Hamlin Finch died due to throat cancer no doubt because of all the angry words trapped in his throat to Caroline's thinking. Hilda is a real piece of work and always gets her way by any means possible. Hilda has strongly insisted that she come to the Spa with her and Caroline, full of resentment, has done as she asked. Hilda knows the owner, Claudia de Vries from their first year at Brown University and their relationship is clearly not the best.<br />Soon after introducing a number of characters, the Spa owner is found dead in a mud bath and clearly a victim of strangulation. Detective Vince Toscana, far from his beloved home in Philadelphia, is called to investigate and soon finds the fellow guests are less than helpful. Almost all of them have secrets and as rich, important people simply can't be bothered with a little problem of murder in their midst. What follows is a Colombo style movie of the week literary version with homage to Agatha Christie as the bodies begin to fall and his investigation seems to go nowhere. Caroline is forced to help against her wishes and uncovers more about her life and her past than she ever wanted to know.<br />Overall, this is a well-written novel and it flows from start to finish. There is the occasional glitch as one author or another takes a character off on a different tangent, but overall this book works surprisingly well. The glitches are very minor and if anything, seem to add to the work and to remind the reader that this was a serial novel in the tradition of Naked Came the Manatee and Naked Came The Stranger. If you are looking for a work that symbolizes each author's unique writing style then this novel is not for you. But if you are interested in seeing how thirteen literary voices could be blended into one style, you won't be disappointed.

If you are looking for a work that symbolizes each author's unique writing style then this novel is not for you. But if you are interested in seeing how thirteen literary voices could be blended into one style, you won't be disappointed. A bit melodramatic at times, this is still one very good read.	2004-01-30

It seems like the confirmation and praise goes to the head and the author never lives up to the true potential that was shown in the first work. Roy Johansen won an Edgar a few years back for The Answer Man. In that novel, Ken Parker runs a one man polygraph firm and is solicited to help a suspected embezzler to beat the polygraph. He accepts the job, with some misgivings and then his entire life begins to fall apart.  While it is a pretty good read, this novel is so much better.<br />Beyond Belief opens with Joe Bailey. He works for the Atlanta Police Department and has been tagged with the nickname \\"Spirit Basher.\\"  Joe works the magician cons where he goes after the phony psychics and spiritualists that prey on people. Since Joe used to be a professional magician, he is pretty good at scouting out the fakers. But, usually he does not have to deal with murder.<br />One night, he is called out to investigate the murder of Dr. Robert Nelson. Dr. Nelson ran the parapsychology program at Landwyn University. Dr. Nelson searched for the paranormal and Joe was involved in the program as well, in the job of exposing the fakers. The two did not get along, but that isn't the issue at this point.<br />What is the issue is that Dr. Nelson has been found dead in his home. Not just dead, but impaled at the top of one wall by a sculpture of chrome spikes that no one could have lifted. But he is hanging there, clearly dead, and Dr. Nelson's girlfriend  is convinced she knows exactly who did it. Jesse Randall, Dr. Nelson's latest and very spectacular find.<br />Jesse seems to have the ability to move objects with his mind. Nelson was studying Jesse and Jesse was fed up with being the object of curiosity. Jesse's anger seemed to have erupted in his sleep in \\"shadow storms\\" --violent telekinetic activity-directed at the professor. The culmination of these increasingly violent episodes was the murder of Dr. Nelson.<br />Joe is convinced that the boy is a fake and there is a rational explanation. As he investigates, Jesse seems to turn his anger towards Joe stepping up the pressure. Is he real and is he the Child Of Light as one of the millennial cults claims? As more and more unexplained happenings occur, and strangers seek to exploit Jesse for a cause, Joe must find out once and for all if his powers are real or not.<br />This is a very good book and very well written. Strong in action, the characters are multi dimensional and interesting. Mr. Johansen's writing style in this novel is completely different than his earlier work and the resulting storyline is much more complex. This thoroughly enjoyable book is one to make sure you read.r. Nelson.<br />Joe is convinced that the boy is a fake and there is a rational explanation.

Tucker Peak is typical Vermont. For natives it is a fun place to work and a place to party all night. To outsiders, it seems a little too much on the rustic side and needs work. But the economies of places like Tucker Peak are changing, just like almost everything in life, and the owners think they have a new plan to rev up the resort and cash in. But their plan is being stopped by a group of radical environmentalists that want the resort to remain the way it has been and not create a further strain on the environment.<br />Joe Gunther now heads the newly created Vermont Bureau of Investigation and for once, his personal life is relatively stable. This allows Archer Mayor to focus more on the story and less on character development as Joe Gunther and his team becomes embroiled in theft, murder and corporate politics on the mountain.<br />Initially Joe and his team are called in by the local sheriff, Snuffy Dawson. Sheriff Dawson has his hand full with the daily protests of the environmental group. In addition, there has been a string of home burglaries with the latest involving a VIP by the name of William Manning. Along with his abrasive and condescending personality, Mr. Manning has the clout to get the governor personally involved. Mr. Manning believes that one of the sheriff's deputies who happens to moonlight for a second income as security on the mountain is in on the robbery and he does not want the local Sheriff's department involved in investigating the case. While Sheriff Dawson resents the implication that the deputy can't do the job or that he can't solve the robbery, he is understaffed and needs all the help he can get.<br />Joe agrees and takes Willy Kunkle out to meet Mr. Manning. Before too long, they see what kind of arrogant human being Mr. Manning is and become interested in the case. Soon, the trail will lead to more burglaries and death on the mountain, while the radical environmental group begins to sabotage the resort. The action comes fast and furious rising to a very strong conclusion, as the case breaks open during a blizzard on the mountain.<br />This is a very enjoyable book and Mr. Mayor has brought back all the characters from earlier in the series. Some old events are rehashed and psychological issues are dealt with, so if you have not had the pleasure of reading earlier books in this series, I would suggest you do so, before reading this work. While the action is considerable, there is little psychological development of the characters in this novel. They read like old friends who have been through a lot and while they are working, for once their personal lives are relatively stable. No doubt, emotional turmoil is coming, but after the last several novels, it is very nice to see these characters in a more action oriented environment with less personal strain.the trail will lead to more burglaries and death on the mountain, while the radical environmental group begins to sabotage the resort.

However, in this case, he has raised it to the front and center major theme of the novel. That theme, along with plenty of very detailed history lessons combine to make this novel at times an interesting, if overall very slow moving, read.<br />Gabriel Allon is still doing occasional spy work for the unnamed Israeli Spy Agency as well as still restoring art works. He works for Julian Isherwood, an art dealer with a rather fatal affliction for an art dealer. Julian hates to sell any of the artwork that grace his walls and as such, if one is sold, falls into an incredible depression. He too seems to work at times for the unnamed Israeli Spy Agency but the lines are less clear than that with Gabriel. Julian tells Gabriel he has been contacted in a rather roundabout way, not unusual in the murky art world according to Julian, and has been asked to send Gabriel to Zurich, Switzerland to restore a painting. While restoring art is the one thing that gives Gabriel peace and allows him to live with himself, he is less that thrilled with the idea of going to Switzerland, especially under such strange circumstances.<br />Gabriel eventually agrees and when he arrives at the home where he is to restore the painting, discovers a dead man on the floor. Gabriel has killed in the past on behalf of the Israeli Spy Agency and cant afford to report his finding to the Police. He flees the scene and attempts to flee the country, before being picked up by the Swiss Police. Gabriel learns from the Police that the dead man was a very wealthy Swiss banker (among other things), Augustus Rolfe and while the Police cant prove he did it, they know of another killing he most definitely committed on their soil.<br />Soon, Shamron, Gabriels spy boss, learns of the arrest and is forced to make a deal to have Gabriel released. Shamron arranges for Gabriels release and freedom for him to leave the country contingent on his never returning to Switzerland and in exchange, wants and demands Gabriels help.<br />Listen to me, Gabriel! Shamron slammed his fist onto the console. Augustus Rolfe, a Swiss banker, wanted to speak to us and for that he was murdered. I want to know what Rolfe was going to tell us, and I want to know who killed him for it!<br />Shamron gets what he wants when Gabriel reluctantly agrees to help. This action brings him into the sights of an assassin only known as The Englishman. The assassin works for a powerful group of Swiss businessman and financiers who want to keep secret the fact that the Swiss actively collaborated with and funded the Nazi war machine and have retained not only the monetary profits of such actions but the millions of pieces of artwork looted by the Nazis has they rolled over Europe.<br />Interspersed frequently with very detailed history lessons, The Englishman and Gabriel Allon play a cat and mouse game across Europe with the stolen artwork just part of the problem. Between them, like a prize bird in a cage, is Anna Rolfe, a trouble woman who is also a brilliant concert violinist. While she knows nothing of her fathers dark legacy she very well may lose her life because of it.<br />While this is by no mans Daniel Silvas best work, it is better that most of the so-called thrillers on the market today which does not say much for the market today. The action is much more limited than in his previous works but at the same time fits the stereotypical characters as written. At the same time, this is the same kind of situation that has been beaten to death in the past and it is somewhat disappointing to read yet another book on the same subject. Instead of preaching lessons told better elsewhere, it would have behooved Mr. Silva to look for inspiration elsewhere and hopefully, now that this particular novel is out of his system, he will return to what made him worth reading in the first place.h reading in the first place.	2004-01-08

Vassa Island is the stage for twelve contestants bidding for two million dollars and their heart's desire.  With 638 cameras arranged around the island and twelve contestants, the race is on to be the final contestant.  Dana Kristen is the last contestant added and if she wins, she just might save her own child's life and get her into a medical study in Switzerland. Her daughter, Jenna, is slowly dying from a form of Muscular Dystrophy and a new possible drug is being studied in Switzerland. More than the money, Dana desperately wants to get her into that study.<br />She soon regrets fighting so hard to be one of the twelve when just minutes into their live world wide broadcast, the host and entire broadcast team collapse and die horrible screaming deaths in front of them. They are informed by an electronic voice that he is now in control and that each day the world will vote for one of them to die. The others will live on, after receiving an injection to control a designer Ebola virus circulating in their bloodstreams for another twenty-four hours.<br />The game will continue as before but now instead of just losing, they face the prospect of losing their life. And whoever is in charge now has managed to make the viewing public accomplices to murder. What does it say about a society that will judge twelve contestants and knowingly vote to execute them one by one?<br />Unfortunately that question and others that this novel raise are never addressed in any way, shape or form. While full of action that really moves the story along, there is little substance behind this novel. The characters are stereotypical, the writing is average at best and the sequence of events is predictable. The \\"twists\\" that fill the last fifty pages are of the kind one finds in a really bad movie of the week.<br />Instead of condemning the reality television concept, Jim Brown seems to raise various societal questions and then swat them away as he profits off the concept. As such, he becomes part of the problem he seems to condemn.  All he needs is some catchy theme music that would play as the novel was opened and he would have a sure winner on his hands. No doubt the action filled computer game and new series can't be far behind.ds in a really bad movie of the week. <br />Instead of condemning the reality television concept, Jim Brown seems to raise various societal questions and then swat them away as he profits off the concept.

However, while the work itself is fairly good, the reader is set up for disappointment if one believes the unbelievably misleading jacket copy. Being charitable, one might consider it the honest effort of someone totally unfamiliar with the series, characters involved, and who apparently never bothered to take the simple step of actually reading the book. Or from a more cynical viewpoint, it might be stated that an assumption was made that the jacket copy should be written the way it was in order to pump up sales for those of us that actually expected to read about Lord Richard Rahl, Mother Confessor Kahlan, and their ongoing battle with the evil Keeper. They do make their appearance, but not as the jacket suggests throughout the entire novel. Instead, they arrive on page 500 of the 557-page novel. Either way it was done, the jacket copy is completely worthless so please do not be misled.<br />After six preceding novels, the back-story is important and quite complex. Simplifying greatly, Richard Rahl is the offspring of a Lord Rahl, who was an evil ruler and a tool of the demon of the underworld, Keeper. Richard Rahl eventually followed one of the great prophecies ordained thousands of years ago and written in the great books in the Wizard's Keep and deposed his father and became Lord Richard Rahl. Against various foes and dark forces, he has tried to change things for the better for his people and to wipe out the scourge of the dream walker, also known as the Keeper. Lord Rahl is a throwback wizard to more ancient times in this land of magic. He has the power not only of the additive, but also the negative, forms of magic and in this way has become the one some of the ancient prophecies spoke of with the power to rule, or destroy, the known and unknown world. Along the way, he united with the Mother Confessor Kahlan, both in marriage as well as their peoples.  Together, they have sworn to free the world from the clutches of the Keeper.<br />As this novel opens, the battle rages on elsewhere between good and evil. But, Jennsen has her own problems. Both her mother and her are in hiding because Lord Rahl (Richard's father) sent out soldiers years ago to find all his illegitimate offspring and kill them all. He procreated madly, not only because he never met a woman he didn't like but also because he was trying to create his own true heir (that he could control according to another prophecy that may yet come true or not). Her and her mother have been on the run since she was little and Jennsen has always her voices in her head. Voices that no one else hears that tell Jennsen to surrender and give up. She does not know why she hears the voices or what to do when she finds a dead soldier near their hiding place. The dead soldier has her name on a slip of paper and it means that others looking for them must be close by. She is at a loss as to what to do and her panic is mounting by the second. She is even more confused when Sebastian steps out from behind a tree in the rain and offers his help.<br />Soon, they hatch a plan to dispose of the body and to bring the ill Sebastian to Jennsen's home for food and shelter. Soon, events begin to spiral out of control and Jennsen is forced to flee her last home as her mother has been murdered at the hands of soldiers looking for the both. Jennsen sets out on a trail, seeking vengeance for her dead mother as well as the answers to her past. With Sebastian at her side, the trail will eventually lead them both deep in the Old World, and to where life itself began in the barrendesert, at the pillars of creation.<br />As noted above, this novel is fairly good on its own merits and is a far cry from the book described on the jacket copy. It seems to be more of a setup novel, where new characters have been added, to go forward with Lord Rahl and the Mother Confessor to correct the situation at the conclusion of the proceeding novel. Magic plays a much smaller role in this novel and there is quite a bit less action as well. Instead, it is more about the journey each character goes through, both physically and emotionally, as they follow what they believe to be the truth as opposed to the actual reality of the situation.<br />While seventh in the series, this novel could be read as a stand alone book as there is a fairly short explanation of the preceding works in the last few pages of the novel. However, I would strongly encourage readers who are interested to go back to the beginning with the first book, Wizard's First Rule. The first book does start off slow, but really picks up about half way through and is well worth the read as are the rest of the series.

We are not as smart as we think we are, in short. From his first book, \\"Andromeda Strain\\" (which later became a movie of the same name) his literary vision has been of forefront technology coupled with human error bringing about unintended and often disastrous results. In \\"Andromeda Strain,\\" the spacecraft brings to earth space microbes that grow and kill. A concern that NASA took very seriously in the early days of the space program and now ignores as a virtual impossibility.<br />Of course, there was \\"Jurassic Park\\" where some dinosaurs were brought to life in the present, which did not work out that well. \\"Timeline\\" had its own technology issue where some of the characters didn't want to come back and were causing problems in the past. In his recent book, Michael Crichton picks bits and pieces of earlier novels as well as trendy topics such as being a stay at home Dad and corporate malfeasance to whip up a novel that reads almost like a B movie. To say this is a shallow book, at least in regards to characters, gives the concept of \\"shallow\\" a bad name.<br />Jack used to have it all. The super kids, the great cars, the nice house and a really cool job in Silicon Valley, California at MediaTronics. He was having a blast supervising the team and helping to create \\"distributed intelligence\\" programs. (Simplifying greatly, distributed intelligence programs as explained in the book are computer programs that mimic real world animal behavior to make computers work better and smarter. By acting like animals in a herd responding to stimuli, the computer program learns how to make the overall computer system work better.) However, Jack slowly became aware of a gigantic corporate fraud being perpetrated on the shareholders and employees. In doing the right thing, he got himself fired and black balled by his former employers at the age of forty. For the last six months, he has been a stay at home Dad while his wife Julia has been working more and more hours.<br />She is a corporate big shot for Xymos Technology. The company is at the forefront of Nanotechnology by using a different approach than normal. They are combining genetics with some elements of nanotechnolgy and distributed intelligence programs to create a different form of nanotechnolgy. The problem is that the company is desperate for Venture Capitalists and their financing and time is running out.<br />The strain at work is clearly taking a toll on Julia. The strain of Jack being out of work after six months in the Silicon Valley, which is a virtual death sentence in the world of cutting edge computers, is taking a tremendous toll on both of them. With resentment on these issues as well as a host of others, Jack suddenly concludes Julia is having an affair. Not only is she dressing differently and subtly more beautiful despite the long hours she puts in at the office, her whole physical appearance seems to be changing. The way her body looks from head to toe seems to be subtly different and an improvement on her. Her personality seems to be shifting as well.<br />But, his marital problems seem to slide onto the back burner when his old employers want him back temporarily on a consulting basis. It seems that Xymos Technology bought a computer program he designed called PRED/PREY and are having problems with their use of it. Not only did Julia never mention that they had bought it despite being in a position to know, Jack can't figure out what use they would have for it or why it won't work. The program is designed as a model of predator and prey behavior reactions in the wild and while fairly accessible does not really work for what Xymos is working on. But, he needs a job even if it is for a few days and with so many of his former team working for Xymos and acting strange, he takes the job.<br />He is flown out to the fabrication lab forXymos out in the Nevada desert. Once there, he finds out things are far different than he was led to believe. There has been a massive release of nanoparticles from the laboratory. The initial swarm of nanoparticles has apparently given birth to succeeding generational swarms of nanoparticles. Each generation is slowly becoming more complex and sophisticated as they evolve and using the PRED/PREY program, the swarms are learning. So far, the resulting swarms have proved unstoppable to this point and are deadly to animal and human alike. With each new generation of swarms, the fate of mankind becomes increasingly dim and soon they will be totally unstoppable.<br />While the basic story is entertaining, it is a typical end of the world disaster type book. The typical-- we made something, it got released into the environment, we screwed up, and guess what, we are really screwed because it will kill us all. The characters are very shallow even in the case of the main character Jack. He seems two dimensional even in the places where he is supposed to be complicated and interesting and the initial marital setup section before the action gets going is way too long. The other characters who shift continuously in importance also seem to have a lack of depth and substance especially the computer programmers and others of his team.<br />They read like the often-wrong Hollywood versions of techies in that these characters are extreme in personality, dress, and behavior.  Some reviewers have criticized the author in that these characters frequently curse and therefore are offensive to the reader. While the cursing fits the characters as portrayed and did not really bother me, what I found offensive was the stereotypical portrayals of the characters as a whole. Cut from cookie cutter molds, they seem to have as much substance as sugar cookies.<br />Mixed into this morass are frequent long lecture sections on genetics and computer programs that were quite often completely over my head. For those so inclined, there is a multi page section at the back of the book involving a detailed reading list on the source material covering the topics fictionalized in the book. Michael Crichton is well known for doing his research and this clearly was no exception.<br />While the novel managed to hold my interest and was a fast read, too often it felt like I was reading a shallow novel interspersed with a college textbook. The work as a whole reads like the novelization of the latest Hollywood disaster epic as well without the really neat special effects.

The world is a far different and more hostile place. The United States of America no longer exists, broken apart by the evil tyranny of the Confederation of Consolidated Republics known as the CCR. The CCR controls most of the former United States through their jack booted thugs as well as former Americans turned traitors. Prison camps are everywhere as the CCR seeks to further control the dwindling population.<br />Enter Cody Pierce, a fourteen-year-old boy who has had to grow up the hard way. Confined in a prison camp by the evil Colonel Sidoron, he is secretly plotting his escape. He has lulled the commandant and his troops into believing that he too has joined their ranks. Bestowed with the nickname \\" the white fox\\" for his actions and blonde hair, he soon shows them his true nature. He has a secret agenda and plans to make good use of their belief that he is one of them.<br />Soon he makes his first escape from the clutches of the CCR and begins a journey that will take him full circle back to this camp. He will fight for survival repeatedly and be forced to kill and kill again.<br />This novel, while written, is extremely violent in nature and downright rough in spots. This novel is currently on my local school district's recommended reading list for middle school, which covers grades 6 thru 8. I'm not sure that is appropriate and that it wouldn't be better suited to an older grade level. Like any other novel or story, whether the work is appropriate or not depends on the maturity of the reader.<br />As a parent, I read the books my children are assigned and would strongly caution parents to read several sections of this 280-page novel if not all of it to get a feel for the character as well as the violence within this novel. This is a very good book that is simply not appropriate for some children.	2004-01-05

A Jance is a very talented author who created two signature characters. First, there was Jonas Piedmont Beaumont, a Seattle homicide detective. Known to his friends by his initials, J. P., or by the nickname \\"Beau\\" he was always in the thick of the action dealing with death in his home city.<br />Then, a few years ago, J. A. Jance created the character of Joanna Brady. Joanna Brady became Sheriff in Desert Heat after the death of her husband. Written in a very different style than the Beaumont books, they allowed the author to try different things. Not only was the location and hero different, the writing style was completely different. After writing several Joanna Brady mysteries, she seems to have lost the ability to faithfully write Beaumont as he was.<br />In the latest Beaumont novel, gone is the third person writing style that had always existed in the Beaumont books. She has switched to first person, which does not work for the character if you have read the earlier novels. Also changed are basic facts about J. P.'s life, which is rather disconcerting to long time fans. Unfortunately, what is left isn't much of a mystery either though the book does run close to 400 pages.<br />As the novel opens, J. P. is on a forced cruise to the Gulf of Alaska aboard the ship the Starfire Breeze. He has agreed to chaperone his recently wed Grandmother Beverly Piedmont Jenssen. She married Lars Jenssen, a fellow member with J. P. of Alcoholics Anonymous. While he is now J. P.'s sponsor in the group, Lars used to be a commercial fisherman and he is very much looking forward to returning to his old stomping grounds in Alaska. J.P. does not have to stay with them, but he is supposed to be there if the elderly couple needs him.<br />At random, he is assigned to a different dinner table and winds up seated with Margaret Featherman. She quickly makes an impression on one and all as a rather unpleasant person. The setup around her is too complicated to go into due to space limitations, but suffice it to say that she soon disappears from the ship. Apparently, she went overboard leaving behind a long list of enemies that had sufficient motivation to kill her.<br />Soon, J. P. is asked to help out with finding out which one of the many people around her did the deed. Both he and the reader are taken on a methodical and tedious ride to the Gulf of Alaska in the search for the killer. Instead of action, old memories and earlier cases are dredged up and examined as well as the personal motivations of all the characters involved. The overall action is very limited with most of the time spent inside J. P.'s head as he ruminates on this situation and others.<br />In short, this effort was a crushing bore for this reader. While it might have helped J. A. Jance take a cruise off of her taxes it should not have been inflicted on the rest of us.

My copy had numerous typos or misspellings as well as several fundamentally flawed sentences that provoked unintentional amusement. Not to mention the fact that photographic evidence uncovered by the hero of this book, Lindsey Dyson, would have been caught from the beginning by any half way competent medical examiner. In this day of authors such as Patricia Cornwell, or the extensive books on the subject from the various writing organizations and others, such a fundamental flaw is surprising and a real deterrent to the work.<br />As the novel opens, Lindsey Dyson is a star investigative reporter for the Midland Press.  As such, she expects to be assigned to important cases that are worthy of her talents. Instead, she has been assigned along with her partner, Roger, by the paper's editor, Oliver, to what has been classified as a suicide.<br />Fuming the whole way over to the deceased woman's house, she is convinced that there is no story to be found worthy of her talents. The husband is distraught, but coherent, and is convinced that his wife did not commit suicide, as the Police believe. His evidence consists of a pill bottle found by her dead body, for a medicine she never took. Also, her moods had shifted dramatically since moving up an executive position with Charisma Fashion and Design.<br />Lindsey grudgingly promises to check into the case. She goes back to the paper and quickly learns from Oliver that the dead woman is one of four suicides in the last several years by women at the company. In each case, the woman was a top executive and the Police had determined the death was a suicide. Oliver tells her the names of the other reporters and the investigation begins.<br />Like everything else in life, quality control matters. While many reviewers would have given up in disgust with the noted problems, I continued on, trying to see past the problems to the kernel of story. The story itself and its elements are very good stuff and well worth the read. However, the technical flaws noted above weaken the work tremendously. Based on the issues noted above, this is one ebook that apparently had zero editing and clearly needed it. And that is a major problem for the author as well as the reader. When a book that has an engaging story to tell as this one does and has major editing issues, the overall read is diminished severely.<br />This could turn out to be a very good series with some technical improvement based on the copy I was sent some time ago. One hopes since it was an e-book the flaws were found and fixed because the actual story was pretty good. Hence the three stars which was a compromise between a 5 for story and a 1 for technical stuff.tory itself and its elements are very good stuff and well worth the read.

Gone are the complex plots, intriguing characters, and story twists that marked so much of his earlier work. Now, he seems to have become nothing more that a word hack, cranking out a weak novel every year. At the same time, I keep reading them hoping to see flashes of past brilliance. Unfortunately, Mr. Higgins continues the recent tradition in his writing where the good guys do evil (at times) for the right cause and the bad guys are misguided and do evil for the wrong cause.<br />In this case, the lovely Kate Rashid leads the evil forces that plan to destroy the world, as we know it. The novel follows up on the situation at the end of his last novel, Edge Of Danger, where her three brothers were dead at the hands of the good guys leaving Kate Rashid vowing vengeance. As Countess of Loch Dhu, Kate Rashid controls the vast holdings of the Rashid Empire. Like the last book, the flow of oil to the United States and England is her weapon to topple governments. But, she also seeks to inflict personal pain on Sean Dillon, Blake Johnson, General Charles Ferguson and the others she holds personally responsible for the deaths of her brothers. As she assembles her supporters and pawns, so too does General Ferguson assemble his pawns and supporters. Soon, all the usual suspects are in play and a plot that could be sketched on the back of a bar napkin is underway.<br />This novel continues in the recent tradition of Jack Higgins. The writing is weak, the character development is exceedingly limited, the style is poor and the scenic descriptions are poor. The sameness of his recent novels continues and the reader is left with the sense that this has been read before, many times. It is unfortunate that he continues in the slide from the promise of his early novels to a writing style and effort that just seems to be going through the motions for a few sales. This author has talent and expertise that he simply is not using, for whatever reason, and that is a shame. It may be time to forget this author and move on because like many a great athlete that pushes past his prime, he simply does not have it anymore and that is a shame.at he simply is not using, for whatever reason, and that is a shame.

You don't sit back when you or a loved one is being assaulted. And you don't act like the government with their `proportional responses' and all that nonsense. If someone hurts you, mercy and pity must be put aside. You eliminate the enemy. You scorch the earth. Those who scoffed at this philosophy, who thought it unnecessarily Machiavellian, usually were the ones who cause excess destruction.\\"<br />So wrote Harlan Coben in his very enjoyable book with a theme of vengeance and revenge. At center point in this novel is Doctor David Beck. A man of medicine and a man that does not believe in the modern day psycho babble nonsense concerning such things as closure. For David Beck, time does not heal all wounds. First his father died twelve years ago in what could have been a simple traffic accident or a suicide. Then, eight short years ago, his wife was murdered.<br />The fact that he was powerless to stop it, dropped by blows to the head that cracked his skull does not alleviate his pain and his guilt over her murder. They were at the family retreat and she was grabbed, he was brutally assaulted and pushed off the dock to drown in the lake. The fact that he survived was a medical miracle and something that he has never accepted. He misses her tremendously every single day of his life.<br />Despite the fact that everyone had told him to move on, he can't. And as it comes time to mark their anniversary, he is reminded how much he misses her. Then, he gets a strange e-mail with a message containing a phrase that only the two of them shared. No one else could possible know the phrase or what it means. Then, he gets a second message a day later and is soon directed to a web cam that for a moment, somewhere in the world, shows her. Or someone that looks amazingly like her.<br />He begins a frantic search, turning to his friends and family. At the same time, someone is searching for him and to find out what he knows about happened eight years ago. And they will stop at absolutely nothing to get the answers they seek to end the problem once and for all.<br />This is a very enjoyable novel and primarily action oriented. There is some character development on a rather limited scale, but the focus is on a man running for his life from events beyond his control. Sure it has been done before but this one is better than most.

Unfortunately, almost from the opening page, it becomes very clear that this book is not going to be up to his usual quality. In this case, he has committed the ultimate sin for a thriller writer---boring the reader. This novel reads as if the author was being paid by the word and that is rough on any reader, especially when the novel runs 550 pages. That makes this read a long slog through a verbal marsh with occasional pieces of action to advance the story along.<br />As the novel opens, Web London is with Charlie Team, a unit of the super secret elite Hostage Rescue Team of the FBI. Their mission is to attack and neutralize a building in a crime infested neighborhood in Washington where it is believed that drugs and money laundering is going on. The team is supposed to seize the building and contents as well as taking the men inside, accountants and the like, alive so that they can testify later.<br />The mission begins to go horribly wrong when Web London freezes as they approach the building. His body locks up and he falls to the pavement, powerless to move in the trash-strewn courtyard as his team jogs into an ambush. Hidden machine guns open up and the team is literally blown apart in front of his horrified eyes.<br />But, he isn't alone there in the courtyard with the dying and the dead. A ten year old boy and relative of a notorious drug kingpin is also in the area. Web manages to save himself and the boy, only to be later scorned by his superiors, friends, and a hostile media as the sole survivor. Details of his past begin to leak out and he is presented in public and private as, at best a coward and at worst, a traitor who knew what would happen to his team. He is neither but he is unable to explain what happened to him and why.<br />As he tries to solve what happened to him and his team as well as dealing with survivor guilt, Web enlists the aid of the beautiful, Claire Daniels, a psychiatrist. It soon becomes clear that he will have to deal with painful events from his traumatic childhood as well as a threat filled present and future to survive, physically or emotionally. Unfortunately for Web, the threat comes literally from his own mind as well as various outside forces that are using him as a toy for their own purposes.<br />As one works through this verbose book, which would have been better if at least 100 or so pages had been removed, one has to wonder if this character could even function in real life. Not as a member of HRT, but as a person selling you your morning cup of coffee or working the register at the grocery store. Beyond all the psychobabble jargon used as he is being treated, this character as written, is a seriously messed up persona. The explanations given for his past and his ability to be a part of HRT are weak at best and the reader must sustain a heavy sense of disbelief for the story to work.<br />On that level, for this reader at least, it fails. Additionally, with so much time spent pondering various mental issues, there is little action that moves the story forward. When the action does happen, it is weighted down by excessive verbiage, which slows the action to the point of a ponderous crawl. What is left is nothing more than an average to mediocre thriller at best and a great disappointment for this Baldacci fan. Considering that this has been a repeated situation in the last several books, one has to wonder if the author is past his prime and sinking?oon becomes clear that he will have to deal with painful events from his traumatic childhood as well as a threat filled present and future to survive, physically or emotionally.

Dietz	It would be all together too easy to dismiss this novel, first in a series, as yet another typical Aliens attack invasion story. And, on one level, that is in fact all this entire novel is about. Aliens, in this case known as the Saurons, have arrived in the year 2020 and using their technologically advanced weaponry, have laid waste to the planet. In the three days since their sudden arrival on what is forever known as \\"Black Friday,\\" the Saurons have destroyed nearly every single manmade structure on the planet. Major cities and small villages are nothing more than smoking rubble, billions have died, and the rest of humanity has been enslaved except for a few pockets here and there. Ironically, the Saurons have now designated our world as \\"Haven.\\"<br />While working on the typical alien invasion, everyone dies, but don't forget the inevitable resistance movement scheming to take back the planet (where is Arnold when you really need him?) level, there is an intriguing deeper level to this novel. The Saurons Empire is made up of subjugated races and there is simmering internal racial strife. \\"Yes, there was little doubt that the great architect understood the nature of his creations, wisely setting Zin over Kan, Kan over Fon, and the Saurons over all the other species.\\" Not only are there strong distinctions between the groups, such as the Kan who are the fighters but seem to have little independent reasoning ability on their own, there are also distinctions between individual members of the same group. In the Sauron culture, the darker one's appearance is becomes the determining factor of importance and as such, regulate the Fon as being the lowest of the low.<br />While the Saurons have the same internal political infighting issues and racial problems that have plagued Mankind for centuries, they also seem to have the inability to see beyond their own biases. In so doing, they place dark skinned persons in power as overseerers in various roles over what is left of humanity. Not only does this encourage white separatist groups to armed organized resistance, it causes factions to develop in the Saurons Empire. Soon, radical elements in the alien and the human communities join forces, united in their opposition.<br />While dealing with the touchy theme of racism, Mr. Dietz also throws in elements in regards to a religious theme. The Saurons are a nomadic empire, going from planet to planet on a quest as outlined in their \\"Book of Life.\\" Following their religious theory, they have come here to build what appear to be temples before moving on to the next planet. But, for reasons initially known only to themselves, the temples have to be constructed using a rigid set of protocols in a specified time frame and time is running out.<br />At 355 pages, this is a very enjoyable read working on different levels and themes. Primarily an action-oriented novel with some limited character development, Mr. Dietz keeps the preaching down to the barest minimum. Readers need to be aware that beyond its twist ending, this novel is a setup novel for the next in the series. As such, the ending is very open and this novel leaves quite a number of story threads hanging.

That Earth was the same as this one in history, people and places until the horrible nuclear war that devastated this planet and created the Death Lands. On the other Earth, while they avoided the horrors of a nuclear war, they faced unbelievable horror due to uncontrollable population growth. On that world, five major companies ran the world, had stripped it bare and were feverishly working on research to move the rich and powerful to a new world leaving the rest of the population to die. They have to evacuate that Earth, because not only have they stripped it bare of materials, they accidentally released a microbe that is consuming everything it touches. As the green fungus spreads worldwide, it is slowly but sure consuming everything it its path. Ryan and his fellow travelers thought they had closed the time portal to the other dimension successfully, sparing this planet further intrusion from the other world.<br />However, early in this novel, with the sighting of a star in the heavens that moves only as a satellite would and with all human satellites long since burned up in the atmosphere, they know they failed. Based on what happened before, they know that these offworlders use the by products of the nuclear exchange as fuel for their equipment. They journey back to Slake City (Salt Lake City, Utah) where they first met the explorers from the other Earth. Salt Lake City was destroyed in the nuclear exchange and the Great Salt Lake was turned into radioactive glass that coated the remnants in radioactive glass entombing the wreckage and a several mile wide crater. Soon, Ryan Crawdor and the others are captured and are put to work mining the nuclear glass with other slaves for what seems to be an invincible first wave of military occupation forces from the other Earth.<br />But while things do appear dark, the forces from the other Earth have their own internal problems and time is running out for all.  And with a new book every few months, you know the good guys will win, even if temporarily, and the bad guys will be vanquished, even if temporarily. This series is one of those guilty pleasures kind of things.

The Sheriff and all the others are back with the Sheriff happily counting down the hours until he gratefully leaves office. He is looking forward to the peace and solitude of his adobe home with absolutely nothing planned to do upon his retirement.<br />Still an insomniac as much as ever, he relishes taking his police vehicle and driving up in what passes for mountains in his area and contemplating the scene below in the dark hours of the night. From his perch, he sees the beginnings of what appears to be a routine police chase of a drunk driver. However, the driver flees and is soon headed up toward Sheriff Gastner as the vehicle follows the switchback mountain road steadily higher.<br />Sheriff Gastner happens to be sitting on a small gravel turnoff that few know about and is not visible to traffic on the road. Matt Torrez is the drunk driver of the vehicle containing himself as well as two other teenagers and he knows the little road as well. Thinking that he is going to escape from the fleeing officer, who turns out to be his cousin as well as the most likely new sheriff after the election, Robert Torrez, Matt turns down the little used road.<br />Before he can stop, he rams Sheriff Gastner's car driving it precariously close to the edge.  Matt escalates things further by refusing to surrender and instead, fleeing into the scrub brush where he soon vanishes. His companions are not so fortunate.<br />Soon, the chase is on to figure out where Matt is and why he is running from a simple traffic stop. Along the way, Sheriff Gastner will also find himself tangled up in a the middle of a cattle rustling case as well as election year politics, family problems, and what to do after he leaves office. To detail more would simply ruin the work as many things in this novel are interconnected as well as connected to previous novels.<br />This final installment is another very good read and numerous loose ends are tied up. While Mr. Havill does not plow any new ground with these characters, it is a real pleasure to welcome back old friends. After eight books, this reader feels like he has known these character all his life and I will sorely miss this series and its easy familiarity with readers.

The jacket tells an intriguing tale that sounds like it could be a really good book. Then, somewhere around the halfway point, you slowly realize that the execution of the great idea is flawed. Not just flawed, but screaming down the hill on fire and the book should never have been published. There is a reason for the old saying about judging a book by its cover and this convoluted effort is a prime example.<br />Twelve years ago, Tuck Nyland was supposed to bring a defector from Saddam's inner circle out of Iraq. This defector was supposed to be smuggled out just hours before the attack led by coalition forces was to begin. Unfortunately, for Tuck, the operation failed and he was blamed before being kicked out of the CIA. One of the reasons for his inability to salvage his career was because his superior, Jon Cross, was nowhere around to clear him of the charges against him. Tuck was booted from the CIA and was lucky to only be fired.<br />Twelve years later, Jon Cross resurfaces and wants Tuck as part of his secret team within the CIA. Task Force Seven has been formed to generate intelligence on the Chinese Ministry of State Security (the Chinese version of the CIA) and the ultimate goal is to place an agent with the agency. What Cross' superiors don't know is that there is an agent already within the Chinese agency and she wants out of China now.<br />What they also don't know, but some have begun to suspect, is that there is a Chinese agent working in the White House. As Cross send Tuck on his mission to bring out the agent known as Kingfisher, the Chinese using their assets in this country and abroad to stop him. At the same time, other individuals become involved as political gain, campaign funds, and an attempted Chinese Coup by a rogue General all play their roles.<br />While this novel has plenty of action, there are gaping wholes in plot logic coupled with stereotypical characters. The anguish the reader is supposed to feel over events that haunt Tuck's life falls by the wayside early on in the work. Instead, the reader is treated to some macho character from a B movie, but in this case, it just does not work. But, like many a B movie, while fleeing for their lives, our hero manages to have intimate companionship with several of the female charters, including at least once in the back of a produce truck on a road somewhere in China. My ability to suspend disbelief shattered at that moment, but maybe it is because I hang out with the wrong people.<br />Thought it does have plenty of action, this novel is full of stereotypical characters, convoluted plot twists and holes in logic and ludicrous as well as gratuitous sex scenes. It also commits the cardinal sin of having an amazingly stupid fight scene at the end between the chief villain (there are several) and Tuck. Of course, both must throw down their fully functioning automatic weapons and fight with knives in some sort of martial arts ritual. Kirk did it better on Vulcan, by the way.

Whether it is his long running Spenser series, or the two new series he has started featuring Sunny Randall or Jessie Stone, the books are all pretty much the same. Mr. Parker can be counted on to tell an interesting, relatively simplistic story where evil walks among us and will be struck down as fast as possible. Much like a great Steven Segal movie, the hero will do this almost single handily without a hair out of place and our hero is always a sure hit among the many ladies. When you don't want to have to think to follow along as a reader and you want a guaranteed escape from current reality, Mr. Parker is sure to come up with some enjoyable mind candy. This offering serves as yet another case in point.<br /> Mr. Parker returns to the mean streets of small town life in Paradise, Massachusetts in his recent novel featuring Jesse Stone. Jesse is still the chief of Police and still torn by his love of drink as well as his love for his ex-wife, Jenn. Following up on his theme in Trouble In Paradise, the previous novel of the series, Jesse is still fighting the good fight. He wants Jenn back in the worst way, but is trying to stay strong in his resolve to allow her to find her own life and then decide if he still belongs. Their Wednesday night dates are still on and they remain open to seeing other partners. At the same time, he is still battling the idea that he is an alcoholic and that he will have to deal with it.<br /> Both issues get pushed slightly backward as a body is discovered floating in the lake after a softball game. Jesse thinks he knows who it is and suspects that it is the body of a young teenage runaway. But her family won't acknowledge that she ever existed and due to the condition of the body, identification will take time.<br /> As he and his small force of ten officers begin to work the case, a side story of domestic violence comes to his attention. Splitting his time between both cases becomes a full time effort as he tries to find one killer as well as preventing death in the other case. Jesse has his hands full and hardly breaks a sweat as he goes about his business working both cases.<br />Mr. Parker keeps up his long tradition of shallow characters, plenty of apparent action and almost continuous dialogue in this novel. At 294 pages in length, one would expect that this novel would not read as fast as it does. However, with so little narration and almost continuous dialogue consisting of very short sentences, it becomes an amazingly fast read. Mr. Parker won't change the world through his novels or how you look at it, but he can make you forget about it for a bit.

Some of the regret is due to things she has done; while some is due to events she could not control but yet feels responsible for. The same is true in her recent offering, Dead Midnight.<br />As the book opens, Sharon has just discovered that her brother Joey has committed suicide. Joey went his own way, different from the family and because of various events detailed in earlier novels, Sharon was never close to him. Yet, he was her brother and she feels tremendous guilt over not being able to see the signs and prevent his death.<br />With that fresh in her mind, she is asked by a good friend who also happens to a lawyer who throws a lot of work her way, to investigate another suicide. This is the last thing she wants to do but finds it impossible to follow through on her initial refusal. Glen Solomon is a hotshot lawyer in San Francisco and he has been hired by the parents of Roger Nagasaw who was the suicide.  Roger has committed suicide and the family using a new tactic that has recently succeeded in Japan want to sue his employer, Insite. Insite is an online magazine that purported to chronicle what was new and hip in the bay area and in so doing, the employees worked tremendous amounts of hours as well as being abused by the magazine's management. The question becomes did overwork drive him to suicide as the family alleges, or was something going on internally that pushed him to leap off a local bridge?<br />Sharon takes the case out of a sense of guilt and regret and soon finds that Insite is much worse than she ever dreamed. Without Hy at her side, Sharon is unprepared to deal with the various problems of the case as well as the emotional loss of her very distant brother.<br />This is another fast and enjoyable read from Marcia Muller. While little new ground has been plowed in this novel regarding Sharon, Marcia Muller seems to be in the process of elevating a minor character, Julia, into a major character. Because of her complicated back-story, it should be interesting to see if she remains a force in the Sharon McCone novels or matures to the point of going her own way in a separate series. In the meantime, all the usual folks have been brought back for another round and despite the severe melancholy that plagues almost half of the work, the overall effect is another enjoyable read in this series.into a major character.

Like a Steven Segal movie, one shouldn't take this series too seriously and just go with the flow. You know the good guys will win out at the end or it would be the end of the series and that just isn't going to happen. They will face evil men and women, mutant creatures and plants, in a world gone berserk due to the cataclysmic nuclear war raged between the nations sometime during 2001. (Yes, we all know that it is now almost 2004 but please ignore the point.) They will journey from place to place via a teleportation type device popping up in a military installation known as a Redoubt before venturing outside to explore. No matter how bad it looks outside or the lurking danger, the band of explorers will venture out, leaving the relative safety of the Redoubt, face down the danger, and return back to travel to the next place. The good guys always win and live to face danger another day.<br />As this novel opens, the group awakens to find themselves in yet another Redoubt in what was once the United States and is now known as the Death Lands thanks to the radiation effects. As they explore this Redoubt, which has major appearance differences from the normal Redoubts, they learn that the air system powered by the always present small nuclear generator is failing. This Redoubt also appears to be buried deeper underground than normal which makes their ascent to the surface more precarious, thanks to the diminishing air and land shifts due to earthquakes which have collapsed some of the emergency escape tunnels.<br />Once at the surface, they step out into a lush world somewhere in a mountain setting. The plants have mutated tremendously surviving the frequent acid rains due to the chem. clouds that still circle the planet. The companions begin to wonder if this is a lead to the land that they have heard of somewhere far to the north where mankind is attempting to rebuild civilization. The place is said to be run by the Illuminated Ones who foretold of the planet wide destruction and of a sanctuary open to those could make it there.<br />It soon appears that not only is this not a lead to the mythical place, but they have unwittingly walked into an escalating war between two rival villages in the outskirts of what once was Seattle. One group is led by the Sunchild and consists of a splinter group from the original Redoubt that has become horribly mutated due to inbreeding and their above ground exposure to the elements. Another group, living in underground tunnels of Seattle and calling their village Raw appear normal. They are also descendent survivors of the original Redoubt group. While they appear normal to the eye, they hide a deeper and more chilling sickness and evil.<br />The group, led by the always unflappable Ryan Cawdor, find themselves in the center of the coming battle. Not only do they want to stay alive but they want to find out if anyone knows of the Promised Land that maybe nothing more than a fantasy. And while they try to stay out of folks business, some things are so inherently evil, they have to involve themselves and put a stop to it.<br />This series will never be confused with deep intellectual reading or working on themes at several levels. This is sheer escapist reading--perfect for those days by the pool or waiting for the inevitable delayed doctor's appointment. And if you miss a book in the series, the next one always gives a very quick recap so the reader has some idea what happened.run by the Illuminated Ones who foretold of the planet wide destruction and of a sanctuary open to those could make it there.<br />It soon appears that not only is this not a lead to the mythical place, but they have unwittingly walked into an escalating war between two rival villages in the outskirts of what once was Seattle.

But age is creeping up on him and this one finds him feeling a bit melancholy over lost loves and what might have been. But, those periods are brief as are most of Dirk's times for reflection as he finds himself in one difficult situation after another.<br />As the novel opens, the new luxury cruise ship Emerald Dolphin is on its maiden voyage. Radical in design and style, it has onboard every conceivable state of the art system for its high dollar passengers and crew. It is the first ship carrying the revolutionary electromagnetic engines that have the potential of totally changing the face of transportation. These engines along with newly created oil for them called \\"Slick 66\\" by its inventor, Dr. Egan, are a threat to the major oil companies. Dr. Egan and his daughter, Kelly, are onboard for the maiden voyage so that Dr. Egan can keep an eye on his inventions.<br />Things began to go wrong during the night when a fire breaks out aboard the ship. The fire suppression system does not work and the fire is free to spread throughout the giant luxury liner. The horrific fire throws up a giant glow on the horizon where Dirk Pitt is aboard the National Underwater Marine Agency ship Deep Encounter. They head to the scene and launch a massive rescue operation to save the over 2500 hundred passengers and crew of the Emerald Dolphin.<br />In so doing, Dirk unwittingly stumbles onto a plan to kill Dr. Egan, and obtain his notes by a major corporation seeking to dominate the world for their own purposes. Sure, the theme has been done many times and quite a few of those were by Clive Cussler. Even with the planned and somewhat unbelievable storyline surprise at the end of the novel, it is still worth reading. You know, battered and bruised, Dirk will save the day and the lady and that is what makes it so much fun.

No, it isn't the latest James Bond picture-at least at the time of this writing. Instead, it is another thrilling adventure from the empire of Clive Cussler. One does not read him for deep penetrating insights into the human species. You read him because he does adventure better than just about everyone else even if some of his scenes stretch the limits of believability at times.<br />As noted in the title, this is another in the new series featuring Kurt Austin. And everyone is back to face a foe bent on worldwide domination. In this case the mad man, Razov, is owner of a mining consortium in Russia. He believes that he is an heir to the Tsar's, which were last in power in Russia in 1918. He believes that it is his duty to restore Russia to its early glory and he has a plan to do so. He plans to detonate the massive pockets of methane hydrate along the continental shelf along both coasts of The United States. Among other consequences, the resulting massive undersea landslides would case huge tsunamis that would destroy major east and west coast cities.<br />Of course, with the fate of the world in the balance, he must be stopped. Enter the always studly, Kurt Austin, and the merry band of operatives from NUMA. After being involved in several strange incidents in the Black Sea, Kurt begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Along with the usual scenes of him angrily crossing words with the evildoers, he also has time for the ladies. They, of course, are beautiful, interesting and alluring, and would welcome a brief interlude from the dangers of a world in peril.<br />This writing team does not plough any new ground but one really does not expect them to do so either. These novels are sheer escapism and this novel has several sections devoted to briefly explaining earlier novels in the series. As such, because of those explanations, if you read this novel first, then you don't need to read the others. Regardless take this one for what it is-a light fun read where everything ends happily and the stud does get the girl (for the night, weekend, or whatever.)

Umberto Alvarez lost his family to death when a train crushed their car at a gated crossing. He knows the Northern Union Railroad is covering up the truth and he wants a public apology for the deaths they caused. Systematically, he has managed to derail freight trains of Northern Union's every six weeks or so as he works to the ultimate destruction of a test of a high-speed passenger carrying train.<br />Peter Tyler is the investigator for the National Transportation Board and has his own inner demons to deal with. After a long and distinguished police career, Peter met up with a child molester as the creep was bashing the bay's head against the wall. Something snapped deep inside him and Peter began to beat the molester's head against the wall, just like he had done to the baby. While understandable, Peter's actions became part of a media firestorm since the molester was black and Peter was white. In the aftermath, Peter with his reputation savaged in the media, lost his job, his career, his family and is days away from eviction. So, when tossed temporary work to investigate a current derailment, he leaps at the chance and he has to make it work.<br />The trail will lead him cross country as he discovers the clash between corporate greed, politics and the quest of one man to find vengeance from those who have wronged him. While these are fairly stock characters and Mr. Pearson does not plow new ground that has not been covered better in his other novels, this is still a fairly good read. The action is fast paced and the premise is all too plausible today. For more information on this book as well as his many other books visit his website at [...]	2003-12-18

I had never felt more alone in my life. Once again, I burned, in almost a sexual fashion, to wrap my fingers around the grips and inside the steel guard of a heavy, high caliber pistol, to smell the acrid order of cordite, to tear loose from all the restraints that bound my life and squeezed the breath from my lungs.<br />And I knew what I had to do.\\"<br />While I like James Lee Burke and admire his writing ability tremendously, his books usually bother me. His writings will never be confused with happy ever after endings and are full of characters that for the most part, are full of various stages of moral decay. He has an ability to gaze at the world and write about things that haunt us all. In his world, evil is a spectral presence and truly does lurk in the heart of most people. His latest book is even more in that vein with a strongly implied supernatural component to it.<br />Dave Robicheaux, a Police Detective in New Iberia, Louisiana has seen quite a lot of evil in the world. From the jungles of Vietnam, to the back alleys of New Orleans and now home in New Iberia, he has seen man and woman brutalize and kill total strangers as well as those they profess to love. One late spring day, he is called out to the scene of a brutal rape and murder. The initial suspect is Tee Bobby Hulin, a heavy drug user as well as an accomplished blues singer. While the evidence, what little there is, does point to him, Robicheaux does not believe he did it.<br />Robicheaux begins to investigate and begins to unravel a horrifying mess of interwoven racial ancestry by rape, murder, and greed. As he digs, he discovers a man known only as \\"Legion\\" to both the black and white population of New Iberia and who has haunted his nightmares since the age of twelve is deeply involved. Legion soon begins to haunt his waking hours as well and Deal begins to wonder is he is reachable and stoppable in a human way.<br />This is another complex and multi themed novel by James Lee Burke and features all the usual cast of characters familiar to readers of the series. Despite the fact that this is a long running series, the author manages to unveil new wrinkles not only in the Robicheaux character but as well in several of the other major characters. His long running characters are not the static unchanging cutouts seen in some nay other works, but instead constantly evolve and change based on experience just like real human beings.<br />At the same time, he is weaving various themes such as the nature of good and evil, are humans born evil, etc into the work.

Dequarius Moyes seems to want a job and Deal tries to brush him off. Dequarius insists that he needs to talk to him before being thrown out by the bartender. Deal quickly forgets all about him when the lounge singer appears. The beautiful woman is his old flame Annie, from a time long before Janice his current wife from whom he is separated.<br />The next day, Deal and Russell see Dequarius being beat on by a local police officer. Without a handy videotape camera, they intervene and physically stop the officer from beating the defenseless Dequarius. Both are thrown in jail and almost as quickly released because of the intervention of Franklin Stone. Stone also manages to get Dequarius released. Before long, Dequarius is brutally murdered and Deal seems to have involved himself in something that he does not understand. The Police are unhelpful, to say the least, and the mysterious Stone seems to be pulling unseen strings beyond his land development plans and using his influence to manipulate everyone to an end only he can foresee.<br />This book is a significant improvement over the last novel and is a refreshing return to what made this author interesting to read. The writing is tight with plenty of action and intriguing characters. And once again, just when the reader thinks he knows all there is to the John Deal character, the author manages to add a new nuance to him. This is a fast paced mystery and a story that while it is very complex, moves along at a strong pace. It is nice to see Les Standiford back on his game and this recent effort makes him a pleasure to read again.is a fast paced mystery and a story that while it is very complex, moves along at a strong pace.

Living somewhere in England, she is rescued by her father from her suicide attempt as this novel opens. But her unintentional cry for help largely goes unheeded by her mother or the other adults in her life. Her father, while he means well, is clearly overwhelmed by events and virtually helpless to defend her from her Mother or anyone else that might wish to do her harm. While her mother, Harriet, is able to crushingly dominate her and her father, Edward, she is not so able to dominate a psychiatrist brought in to treat Jessica.<br />Dr. Armstrong begins to work with Jessica who clearly is a very abused young woman. While some of the abuse is the obvious verbal abuse by her Mother as well as Nuns at her school and other numerous adults, other abuse of a sexual nature has occurred. It has been going on for years and as the walls begin to crumble and Jessica begins to talk, the events unleashed are dramatic and painful. The sexual abuse has large repercussions that continue to resonate and unleash other unrelated events throughout the rest of the 174-page novel.<br />While well written, this novel is deeply disturbing and upsetting to read. The fact that so many of the complex characters involved are abusers of one type or another as well as being just completely vile human beings on every level is very difficult to take. So too is the abuse that is heaped on Jessica from nearly everyone in her life. The result creates a book that is very painful to read and extremely difficult to finish. While some positive aspects do arise out of the depicted events, the overall tone is dark and of unrelenting horror.	2003-12-16

This amazingly fast read opens with a universal fear of parents everywhere-the disappearance of their child. In this case, the disappearance destroyed a family and left one son with tremendous guilt.<br />Years ago, Brad Denning sent his younger brother, who wanted to do nothing more than hang out with his older brother and his friends, home from a local park. Giving in to peer pressure, Brad's last glimpse of his eight-year-old brother was of Petey pedaling down the street on his way home with his head hanging down. But, Petey never made it and the family was shattered. Soon his father spiraled into a drunken stupor, lost his job and then his life in a fatal car crash. They were forced to move in with his Mother's parents and she slowly shriveled away and died. Brad, while outwardly appearing successful and running his own thriving architectural business is haunted by the dreams and the guilt over his actions. Over the years, he has given the occasional media interview connected with his business and has spoken of his long lost brother.<br />After the nationwide broadcast of a popular Sunday morning news program, several people who claim to be his brother contact him. They quickly prove to be scam artists. Then, outside his building he is hailed by a man who he does not recognize. The man appears to be homeless, but knows details only his brother would know. Slowly, over several hours he begins to believe the man in and accepts him as his brother. He takes the man in as his brother and begins to help him turn his life around. Then, the man disappears with Brad's wife, Kate and his son, Jason and the hunt begins for his missing family.<br />While there is some character development, this novel relies primarily on action to move the story forward. The book quickly turns into one long extended chase scene as Brad follows a very cold trail across the country looking for his family. The introspective moments, such as they are, a few and far between and while Brad feels guilt over what has happened, the reader never really shares that guilt with him.<br />This novel also relies on a technique promoted heavily these days as advice to writers to keep the chapters very short to encourage the short attention spanned reader to move along. Many chapters consist of just a couple of pages, while others consist of nothing more than a long paragraph and plenty of blank paper. This appearance of the work reinforces the notion from the text that this is a lightweight novel of very little substance and designed to be a fast read at the beach. As such it is perfectly good, but if one is expecting a complex and incredibly enjoyable novel such as his Brotherhood of the Rose (which this novel is mistakenly compared too in the jacket copy) unfortunately, this is not it. Take it for what it is and enjoy it, but don't have high expectations-they won't be met.introspective moments, such as they are, a few and far between and while Brad feels guilt over what has happened, the reader never really shares that guilt with him.<br />This novel also relies on a technique promoted heavily these days as advice to writers to keep the chapters very short to encourage the short attention spanned reader to move along.

Then every now and then, there is a book that has such a twist at the end; the book becomes a horrible book. When a major character over a number of novels is killed off needlessly just when things were going better as another reminder how capricious life is. Considering the fact that Edna Buchanan's books always have frequent references to the capriciousness of life, this is one story telling idea she should have discarded. This book has a simply horrible ending and there is no other way to put it.<br />As the book opens, a repeat offender has been electrocuted while attempting to drop through the ceiling of a Cuban owned store. The storeowner for years had tried to get help from the Miami Police force, but with little success. So, he wired his ceiling intending to give the burglar a small shock and send him on his way. Instead, the man was electrocuted and has to be extricated by Fire Rescue before he takes a trip to the morgue. Soon the District Attorney's office decides to prosecute the storeowner for murder during an election year despite the fact that the dead man has a long history of crime.<br />In fact, his body provides a major clue that leads to a case from over fourteen years ago at Christmas when two teenagers were attacked and left for dead. While Ricky died, Sunny was beaten, raped and shot in head and somehow survived. The case created an intense wave of publicity years ago and while a massive manhunt was undertaken, no one was ever identified or charged in the case. The ripples of that night have ruined so many lives and still haunt the survivors because murder affects everyone who knew the deceased person.<br />The dead burglar is quickly identified and soon it becomes apparent that he was involved in the horrific events so long ago. There are others involved and they have their suspicions as to who they are, but thanks to politics, the Cold Case Squad can't actively investigate. But Sergeant Burch convinces Brit Montero to help work the case with them while ostensibly covering the squad for a profile section of the paper. She of course agrees and soon the nightmare of the past is given new life today.<br />With frequent references to the terrorist attacks and their aftermath, as well as other novels of the series that had their own pain and suffering, this read is a mostly depressing book. That coupled with an absolute horrible ending for long time fans and readers of the series make this book simply one to ignore in the store.re, but thanks to politics, the Cold Case Squad can't actively investigate.

What John Grisham did for layers in his novels, Paul Lindsey has done for the FBI. However, usually Paul Lindsey novels have at their core an agent hero fighting a flawed system where stats and appearances weigh more heavily than actual police work. In this thoroughly depressing novel, which also lacks any shred of humor found in his other works, the hero is fatally flawed on so many levels; the conclusion becomes anti-climatic and expected.<br />Jack Kincade is an alcoholic, a degenerate gambler according to his ex-wife's attorney, a non-existent father to his son, Cole, and a burned out FBI agent. Emotionally dead to himself and others, he spices up his life by robbing banks using a technique perfected years ago involving night deposits. Assigned to investigate those same cases, which are very low dollar in terms of risk and reward, he has managed to dead end them all to this point. However, a lie can only be sustained so long.<br />Thanks to the unexpected re-opening of a three-year-old kidnapping case after the frustrated father plants a bomb under the local jail, Jack Kincade's world slowly begins to its final collapse. Partnered with Agent Ben Alton who is currently in remission form cancer after doctors amputated part of one leg, they begin to work the case. But in so doing, while successful on one level, Alton makes a fatal error in judgment with massive repercussions for everyone. With all the speed and emotion of geologic plates, this novel grinds toward a steadily darker life for all the characters involved in this novel.<br />This certainly is not the best that Paul Lindsey has to offer. Virtually all the characters involved in this 260-page novel, are robotic in thought, emotion, and deed. That fact coupled with the incredible amount of loathing and self hatred expressed by many of these characters is appalling. The redeeming motivations found in his works are sadly lacking in this effort. Hopefully, this book is not a sign that like his fictional characters; Paul Lindsey is burned out as an author.motivations found in his works are sadly lacking in this effort.

While many authors would ditch the old series and write something totally different, Archer Mayor decided to do something a bit different. Instead, he decided to devote a novel to the complex and enigmatic character often seen in the Joe Gunther series known as Willy Kunkle. For fans of the series, this is a fantastic development as the back-story on the very complex character of Willy Kunkle is finally revealed completely. For those new to the series, this is not a stand-alone book and as such should be read after reading the other novels in the series. While it could be read independently, to do so would ruin a large chunk of the series as these events are commented in this novel. These factors also make this very enjoyable book difficult to review without committing the same folly.<br />Newly installed as a Detective in the recently created Vermont Bureau of Investigation, Willy Kunkle receives a call that drags him back into a past that he thought he had left behind. The New York City police have found his divorce papers in an apartment rented by a woman who apparently died of a drug overdose. The investigators want him to come to New York and identify the body and handle all the usual details.<br />After identifying the body as his ex-wife Mary, Willy begins to nose into the case. Driven by guilt and anger over the past and present day events, Willy treats her death as his own to investigate. He spots inconsistencies with the story he is being given by the local Police and those are reinforced when he physically investigates the crime scene. Then, he begins to backtrack into her life and as he does so, not only must he confront various things from his past but he must also deal with a complex changing case that the local Police should not have been so quick to solve.<br />To say more in greater detail about this novel would simply blow this book as well as most of the series for any reader. This is a fast, intense read that answers a lot of questions about the character as well as providing a complex mystery.  There are constant twists and turns that move the book steadily forward and the back-story is nicely woven into the novel.

Originally created by the Defense Department to study nuclear explosions, the computer contains a neural network, which allows it to learn instead of just being programmed. Therefore, the computer can evolve and think for its own and it is now up for grabs to the group that comes up with the best project for it. Somehow, Professor Erricson's idea of having the computer learn languages in the same way as a child would, with English being the first, claims the prize.<br />With space on Campus at a premium, they soon have Simon installed in a little used damp basement room. The room is adjacent to Ocean Park, which among other things has a large tank holding Dolphins in captivity. Quickly after Simon is activated, not only does it learn English, but also manages to teach itself the pips and squeaks of Dolphin language. Then it begins to communicate with the Dolphins in the tank. What Simon learns and passes on to his human handlers in the form of Dr. Ross and others is simply amazing and triggers a cascade of unforeseen events.<br />Like a lot of science fiction, this novel has very little character development. And what character development is done is stereotypical and at times exaggerated. This is further compounded by the fact that a significant part of a secondary storyline that seemed very important considering its prominence in the first half of the book suddenly stops in the middle of the book. Those events are not explained or dealt with for the remainder of the book, which becomes a glaring omission. Equally glaring are some typos that float throughout the book.<br />At the same time, like in most science fiction, the focus is on unintended consequences of technology and action sequences and these areas are handled well. The novel moves steadily forward at a rapid pace. Overall, the work flows well, except for the previously discussed inconsistencies and provides the reader with some unexpected storyline events.<br />For what it is, a science fiction adventure novel, this book works fairly well. The author uses a standard premise that is very common in the genre but at the same time, manages to twist it into a new direction. Along the way, the novel raises a few interesting questions as well as holding the reader's interest. At 280 pages, it is a quick read that provides a fair amount of enjoyment as long as it is not taken too seriously.work flows well, except for the previously discussed inconsistencies and provides the reader with some unexpected storyline events.<br />For what it is, a science fiction adventure novel, this book works fairly well.

He is commander of an understaffed and under equipped squadron stationed on Vancouver Island and his Wing Commander despises everything Lieutenant-Colonel White stands for. He resents his life style, the closeness of his squadron, and his gung ho attitude as a fighter jock. If Wing Commander Banks knew of his eyesight problems thanks to a freak injury, which is not explained well, he would be history.<br />But after the apparent shoot down of a patrol plane by an unknown hostile fighter aircraft, White isn't about to tell him. White knows it was not some mechanical failure as the brass believes and is convinced that the patrol plane was a victim of enemy action. Despite being ordered to do nothing more that support the search and rescue activities, he begins to investigate. His investigation begins to accumulate evidence, especially when a survivor of the downed patrol plane is found, that it was shot down. Over the next several weeks, he begins to uncover evidence of the existence of a faux military unit operating in the area with links to his past.<br />Primarily an action adventure novel, this debut novel works best in that area with a number of authentic flying sequences that directly relate to the author's military experiences. He clearly is operating under the \\"write what you know\\" principle and on those levels, this book works. When he strays from his chosen field, the novel becomes slow moving and nearly grinds to a halt.<br />The character development in this novel is limited and awkwardly handled through several secondary storylines. These diversions from the main plot and storyline are extremely slow and bring the book to a virtual standstill. The dialogue and character interactions through the secondary storylines do not read as if these are real people and seem to serve no more than background filler material. Almost nothing is accomplished in these sections for moving the story forward and if they had been edited out, this novel would have been a more enjoyable read.<br />However, depite those shortcomings, overall this debut novel is an enjoyable read. The plot and action sequences are well done and the author manages to grab and hold the reader's interest. With or without some minor editing in the future, this is an author to keep an eye on in the action adventure field.they had been edited out, this novel would have been a more enjoyable read.<br />However, depite those shortcomings, overall this debut novel is an enjoyable read.

Lankford	Dr. Felix Rossi is a devout Catholic and as this amazing novel opens, about to examine the holy Shroud of Turin. While science has been unable to prove that the ancient burial cloth wrapped his body at death, Dr. Rossi has always believed that it covered the body of Jesus Christ. He has contemplated trying to take a sample from the cloth and using his experience and skills, attempting to clone Jesus Christ. Theoretically it is possible and as he stares at the burial cloth he knows that given the opportunity he would be successful. With the knowledge of a painful family secret having just been revealed to him moments earlier, he makes the impetus move to steal two blood stained threads from the holy cloth.<br />While he is successful with the theft, he soon discovers that the theft was the easy part. Not only does he have to culture the DNA to the point where he can use it, he also must begin a search for his very own Virgin Mary. At the same time, he must fend off a nosy reporter who suspects the truth from the beginning and deal with powerful forces here and abroad that want to put a stop to his cloning efforts. Along the tumultuous journey, he must also confront his own belief system as well as the repercussion his action set into motion as it shatters those closest to him.<br />Following up on her novel \\"The Crowning Circle,\\" J. R. Lankford brings another novel where deeply intense character development moves the work forward. This is an intellectual novel which will bore those looking for a quick read. This is an intriguing novel that repeatedly raises questions of faith and humanity while providing suspense and complicated plotting. How does one define God, the point that life begins, cloning, and what it means to be human are just a few of the many questions raised with no easy answers.

His love life is going down in flames yet again and his mother wants to know why he keeps missing the mandatory Sunday dinner. But all that and other personal problems pale in comparison when he gets himself involved in a missing person's case of strange proportions.<br />The missing person is Jason Caulfield according to Mike Holmes who runs his own investigative company. Jason may have come home to his parent's house and since Darren is the nearest to Jason's home, Mike is requesting Darren's help in locating Jason and will pass on part of his fee for Darren's help. In a strange coincidence, Darren knew Jason years ago as an often picked upon nerd in High School. Mike claims not to have known this fact and other details of the case just don't sound right to Darren.<br />But, Mike has never misled him before and that along with the promise of decent money for what should be a simple enough deal, convinces Darren to take the case and assist. The case becomes steadily more difficult and complicated as Darren learns that Mike wasn't telling him everything and that other forces are serious about recovering Jason and his knowledge one way or the other. Apparently, Jason was working on the concept of time travel and may have found a way to make it happen but Jason needs help. As the body count climbs, Darren begins to identify some of the players but with knowledge of them, they also learn of him and retaliation comes in an unexpected ways.<br />While overall enjoyable, the major problem with this novel is the extremely anticlimactic ending. After working through, at times overwritten dialogue and narration in the 320-page novel, the ending was very disappointing and weak. This ending is not the \\"bang\\" ending one would have expected and weakens the overall enjoyment of what had been a fairly interesting, enjoyable novel.

Parker	This third novel of the Sunny Randall character series finds Sunny with her usual problem. Though she is now divorced from Richie she still loves him whether she wants to admit or not. And he still feels the same about her, but has decided he wants to try to move on. He has found someone else by the name of Carrie and she could be the next Mrs. Right. But, as he points out to her in a small diner, he can't seem to get past Sunny.<br />If he can't and she can't, where does that leave them?<br />That deep intellectual question is quickly shoved to the back burner as Sunny is hired to bodyguard author Melanie Joan Hall. Like Sunny, Melanie is also divorced, most recently for the third time. Unlike Sunny, she has a horrible relationship with her ex-husband Dr. John Melvin. A psychiatrist by training, he is stalking her and trying to cause her to lose control and surrender herself back to his clutches. Her agent recognizes that Melanie needs protection and hires Sunny to provide such protection while Melanie is on her book tour.<br />Things start out well enough and both Sunny and Melanie get along with each other and share a common perspective and background regarding men. And it becomes clear that the good doctor may pose an actual threat, not only in regards to her sanity but to Melanie's life. Sunny decides to investigate the good doctor and eventually moves to pose undercover as one of his patients.  As he escalates the stalking and Melanie begins to crack under the psychological pressure, Sunny realizes that time is running out and she may be forced to take drastic action to solve the threat.<br />Like most of Robert B. Parker's novels the dialogue moves the story forward with limited action. Stereotypical shallow characters populate the novel with everything cast clearly as good or evil with no shades of gray in between. The storyline is straightforward with no twists or turns for the reader and at 289 pages an incredibly fast read. With almost no setting descriptions and chapter lengths of three to four pages there is very little weight to the work. In short, it's the perfect book for the beach or waiting for anyone to come out of the mall this holiday season.

He still loves and misses his ex-wife Constance who is now married to Senator and possible Presidential Candidate, Warren Young. Philip grieves for the loss of his beautiful daughter, Bebe. It is no wonder, thanks to those two problems and a host of others, he has just returned after suffering another nervous breakdown. After more than six months in a hospital, he returns to find himself non-existent in the halls of the Justice Department. Beyond the stigma of mental illness is the fact, before he collapsed, that he testified and exposed the latest political corruption at the highest levels of this nation's government. He still has his reputation of not being able to lie about the facts. For now, to serve its own ends, the Justice Department keeps him on board.<br />Senator Warren Young has a major problem of his own. He is the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and his aide, Martin Greenberg, has vanished. A few of the clues could mean espionage, but they also mean something far more ordinary. Using his influence, Senator Young has convinced the Attorney General to have Philip Barkley run the investigation, which will solve the possible media problem. There is to be an investigation of sorts, but the result is pre-ordained. Philip Barkley's report is to publicly clear Green and in effect Senator Young of espionage so that the Senator can go forth and campaign for the Presidency. If Barkley cooperates and does what he is told, favors will be called in and they will help him relocate to Oregon where he wants to start his life over.<br />Barkley knows that there is much more to this than meets the eye. But since he has nothing left to lose, agrees to the plan. His suspicions are quickly confirmed when he is teamed up with a naive FBI agent and before the investigation starts, new ground rules go into place. It quickly becomes evident that something strange is going on and it has roots that go back more than fifty years ago. The question is whether or not he will figure out everything in time, not only to save his life, but everyone else's.<br />This is the second novel from Stephen Horn and just as good as his first, \\"In Her Defense.\\" Once again, he has assembled an intriguing cast of characters some of which seem to be right off the latest newscast.

As this novel opens, late one night, Lewis awakens and eventually notices the pulsed flashes of blue and red lights through the trees just across from his home. The scene in question is a State Park located adjacent to his small beach home in Tyler Beach, New Hampshire.<br />Lewis, who used to be a research analyst in the \\"Puzzle Palace\\" (Pentagon) until a horrible day several years ago, never can leave things completely alone. Driven by a need to know what is going on, he walks over and finds local police as well as a couple of EMT's standing around a car in the Park parking lot. His press pass for the \\"Shoreline\\" (a regional magazine) allows him some access to the scene as well as the fact that in small towns everyone knows just about everyone else. However, his view of the person who died of a gunshot to the head while sitting in the rental car is abruptly ended when carloads of what appear to be government agents arrive. While they and their leader refuse to identify themselves, they have no problem throwing their considerable weight around at everyone.<br />Soon, Lewis detects the strong stench of yet another governmental cover-up and decides to leave things well enough alone. Because of his past, the last thing he wants is to rise to the attention of any governmental agency but that hope was gone as soon as they arrived at the initial crime scene. Showing even less finesse, the agents soon storm Lewis' home and he is extorted into helping the agents with their case. His forced cooperation leads Lewis into a deeper and deeper maze of murder, deceit, and counter espionage with links to World War Two. This time, not only is he in danger, but everyone he holds dear.<br />Once again, Author Brendan Dubois shows the complex plotting, deep character development, as well as just plain superior wring that led his work to be nominated three times in the past for the prestigious \\"Edgar Award' as well as winning numerous other awards. This novel, like the three preceding it of this engrossing series, is full of complicated characters in complex situations.

A person is threatened, something very dear to them is stolen, a child is involved with a gang and parents don't know what to do. Other people's troubles became his own. That was how he made his living since he resigned from the Treasury Department.\\"<br />And lots of people have troubles and they seem to be in need of what Hannibal bills himself as, a \\"professional trouble shooter.\\" In this second novel of the series, Mother Washington brings him a client even though it is Sunday and the ribs are on the grill. The last thing Hannibal wants to think about this crisp fall afternoon with ribs sizzling on the grill is work. But, you don't say no to Mother Washington.<br />The client is Miss Bea Collins and she is very worried about her finance, Dean Edwards. He had been acting a little strange the last couple of weeks and then disappeared the day before. Of course, the Police won't help since he is an adult and has not been missing very long. Hannibal does not see any reason to take the case but you don't say no to Mother Washington. Despite believing that Dean is nothing more than a con man based on the evidence so far that Bea tells him and that he has moved on to more financially lucrative pastures, Hannibal takes the case.<br />He soon finds Dean but Dean is not the con man Hannibal thinks he is. Instead, he has his own problems and appears to have nicely been framed for murder. In an attempt to clear Dean, Hannibal must follow a trail that leads over fifteen years into the past. A past both men unknowingly shared and ultimately worked to bring them together today.<br />Overall, this is a very good novel. While some lines of the story tend to be a bit over written, the Hannibal character is intriguing and complex. The mystery itself also works with plenty of twists and turns and quite a lot of action.

In fact, Jon Smith arrives just in time to prevent a second murder attempt on his friend's life. At the same time, someone apparently using the new computer manages to bring down the entire United States utility and communication grids. Deaf and blind, the United Sates stands vulnerable to attack and the terrorists seem to be seeing how much havoc they can cause before they launch their final cataclysmic strike. With the fate of the world in the balance as well as his friend's life, Jon begins to follow the complex trail to the terrorists and their secret lair.<br />While that is the premise of what could have been a very enjoyable book, the execution is fatally flawed. Despite it's Bond style ending, much of this book commits the cardinal sin for any thriller. Boredom. This book is an incredible flat, dull read and quite a disappointment. This book is work to read and becomes a long march through the mud of boredom to reach the closing fifty pages that are mediocre at best.<br />While for long time readers of the late Robert Ludlum it has always been clear that this series did not stand up to Ludlum standards, the other two novels were at least fairly enjoyable. Both The Hades Factor (Coauthor Gayle Lynds) and The Cassandra Compact (coauthor Philip Shelby) while overwritten at times featured plenty of action and engaged the reader at least somewhat. However, in this novel, the overwriting is extremely prevalent throughout the novel and the read is entirely flat and without emotion. Even in scenes where, for example, terrorists are attacking Marty's hospital room, the sense of emotion or nerve-racking danger prevalent in Ludlum works is nowhere apparent.<br />The boredom factor is enhanced by the fact that released as a large trade paperback; this novel is 425 pages long. One gets the sense that the authors were paid by the word. Or that Gayle Lynds was unable to correctly follow Robert Ludlum's famous multi hundred plus page outline to properly create the work. The result is a novel that is seriously weaker than the first novel of the series, which she co-authored, and a sign that the series may die without the influence of the legendary master.or Philip Shelby) while overwritten at times featured plenty of action and engaged the reader at least somewhat.

Because of it our descendents will walk again on the Earth's surface, and you will be the fathers of the vessel that will carry our genes forward whilst all life on the surface dies. The city I have named Sanctum will be a place of absolute isolation for, I fear, many centuries. . .'\\"<br />In the year 2728, what is left of humankind has lived for over 700 years below ground in the city called Sanctum. Buried beneath the Earth's surface in Australia, the underground city was devised to allow at least some to survive as the world collapsed due to overpopulation, food scarcity, pollution and nuclear war. However, the city, which is ruled by the Fulberth, has become a prison instead of a sanctuary. The Fulberth are desperate to remain comfortably in power despite knowing the truth about the surface as well as the fact that after 700 years critical systems are failing in Sanctum.<br />Within the city, one of the ones that most desperately wants to get out is a Mazeplayer by the name of Jarret St. John. He wants more than anything else in life to go to Top World, as it is known to Sanctum's inhabitants. As leader of the best team in Mazeplay, he is somewhat untouchable. But he soon pushes the ruling class once too many times and is marked for death. But, the rulers make a fundamental mistake and St. John and his team elude the trap that has been set for them. Not only do they escape but they discover the existence of humans living safely on the surface.<br />The surface people whose ancestors survived the cataclysms and St. John and his team soon unite to bring humankind back to the surface once and for all. Like many adventure novels of this type, this book relies solely on the action in the work to move the story forward.  Character development is very limited with the focus being solely on adventure. Don't read this one expecting depth and deep insight into the human condition. Instead, read it for what it is, a fun adventure read. As such, it is highly entertaining and the first entry in a planned trilogy featuring these same characters.what it is, a fun adventure read.

It has been a great run and while I was hoping for a tenth, I expected due to the way the character has developed that there would not be a tenth. Unfortunately, my expectation proved correct, but while different from the Gastner series, this book still retains the flavor and color of the previous novels. However, since it is not Gastner it does take some adjustment to get used to the new style and tone of the series.<br />As the book opens, Gastner has been regulated to the sidelines in his role as Livestock Inspector. While he appears briefly a couple of times, the main action involves Estelle Reyes-Guzman. Long a fixture of the series she is now front and center and has her hands full. Along with her mother and her failing health, she has children who currently have the flu bug and her husband, a local doctor. Her boss, the newly elected Sheriff Bobby Torrez, is off at Quantico taking a course. As Undersheriff, she is in charge with all the usual problems that brings in running a department and then the bodies start showing up.<br />The first is found out on the prairie and has had half of his head blown off. The lower part of his face is shattered and according to the corner, he thinks it happened after the man was killed by the headshot. While the body is clothed, there are no personal effects and thanks to the weather and the assorted wildlife, roughly three weeks after the person was killed, there is not much to identify. As they start to work the case, within a couple of days, a second body is found. Certain clues with that body lead Estelle to believe that the bodies were killed by the same killer or killers and the hunt begins.<br />There are several secondary stories as well, but to explain them would violate the golden rule of a book review-don't reveal too much. Especially for those new to the series, the explanation of several of the secondary stories would render the reading of those books all but pointless.<br />While this is not a Gastner book, it does come awfully close. The stark beauty of Posadas County comes through once again along with all the colorful characters that make this imaginary piece of New Mexico landscape home. Fortunately, while the author did move Gastner to the sidelines, he wisely did not change the other characters that populate his books. So, while somewhat different, there is enough of the earlier books in this one to make it work once again.eries, the explanation of several of the secondary stories would render the reading of those books all but pointless.<br />While this is not a Gastner book, it does come awfully close.

It is sure to be contentious and fact that it revolves around Pride Park in this cozy mystery is a guarantee of trouble for all concerned. As the novel opens, it is just after Christmas in the small town of Early, Michigan. Rick Cameo is director of services for the small town and in so doing has gained operational control over a number of diverse departments. At the same time, his job duties and his marriage does not stop him from making the time to have a varied and active social life with a number of the women in town. He has also managed to find the time to develop a new use for Pride Park, the small town's gem.  He wants to end the current zoning concerning Pride Park and turn it over to developers who will build a mixed-use retail development on the site. Theoretically, the retail development will bring badly need jobs as well as boosting the tax base. The fact that allowing this to happen would obliterate a beautiful park as well as costing jobs in the local shops forced to close is irrelevant to Rick Cameo. Plenty of folks are against the idea, but Rick knows the dirt on a number of folks as well as knowing who needs to be paid off, in addition to himself, to make sure the deal goes through.<br />But, before he can get the ball rolling downhill too fast to stop, Rick is found dead in his hotel room. Other than the fact that he is fully dressed as well as wet, there are few clues for the local Police to work with. While they mean well, they are clearly overmatched in this case, which is just the latest in a string off odd events and death for the local citizenry. Councilwoman Joyce Fellmeyer realizes that they need help and her old friend retired Homicide Detective Brady Kincaid would be just the man to help.<br />She convinces a local star reporter, Geraldine Pozy, that Brady could come in to town on a press pass and act as a consultant to the local paper while he works on the case. Geraldine is always on the lookout for a good story and sees her point. To do so would allow him to unofficially help the Police, clear the case, and provide source material for Geraldine.<br />Geraldine agrees as does a very bored Brady and soon the two are working the case from their perspective angels of expertise. It becomes clear that the Police effort, well meaning but woefully lacking, extends beyond this case. The death of Rick is definitely linked to other deaths as well as various odd happenings about town.<br />As in most cozy type mysteries, the action in this novel is very limited as compared to the traditional mystery. The novel relies primarily on character development and sleuthing through question and comparing suspects, to move the story slowly forward. The list of suspects is very long and the trail often confusing as so many of the citizens are far different than what they appear to be everyday. Despite the lack of action, the story is very entertaining and the novel is a fine example of what can be done with a cozy type of mystery.rks on the case.

The day you become a parent, fear becomes your constant companion. It never lets you go. My life was Exhibit A in the why.\\"<br />The twin themes of targeted personal deceit and targeted personal loss have long been hallmarks of much of Harlan Coben's work. They both certainly standout in this latest novel which is another stand-alone thriller.<br />Plastic Surgeon Marc Seidman is married and lives in a beautiful home with his lovely wife Monica and their new baby daughter. That is until someone shoots him at close range leaving him for dead, shoots his wife and kills her, and takes his baby daughter. He awakens in a hospital room twelve days later to find out that the police and FBI have no clues and believe he is the primary suspect.<br />Law Enforcement always targets family members initially and when one spouse dies, the other is investigated thoroughly. Dr Seidman knows this and also knows that the longer they focus on him the less likely they will ever find the real culprits and his daughter. All he wants is his daughter, Tara, back where she belongs. The police assume Tara is either dead or long gone and untraceable, but when his rich father in law gets a ransom note demanding Marc make the drop, Marc suddenly has hope again.<br />But the drop goes haywire and the captors vanish without a trace. What follows is a multi month nightmare as Marc begins a long drawn out search for his missing daughter.  Friends and enemies alike have their own secret agendas as does Law Enforcement and Tara is not necessarily at the top of anyone's priority list besides Marc. As other evidence begins to surface that Marc can't explain, Marc fins himself with no one he can truly trust and at the center of a Law Enforcement investigation.  None of that matters, because Tara is definitely alive and he does not care what he has to do to get her back.<br />While much of the novel reminds the reader of Mr. Coben's other novels, especially the recent \\"Gone For Good,\\" this novel is still a worthwhile read. This book is not simply a rehash of his earlier books by changing characters and settings. As Coben always has, he has created another novel full of complex characters, hidden motivations, and mutli-layered storyline.<br />While this novel does not have the humor that his early works did, the anguish and pain that Dr. Seidman is forced to endure comes through loud and clear. The reader is drawn into his nightmare and the work resonates within as this complicated character strives to find his daughter and stay alive.s other novels, especially the recent \\"Gone For Good,\\" this novel is still a worthwhile read.

Breaking away, hopefully just temporarily from his Kodiak series, Greg Rucka has created another intense character battling personal demons and a reality shakily built and on the verge of collapse. Unlike Kodiak, Mim Bracca does not have the resources to cope, either personally or by extension through her relationships with others.<br />Mim Bracca is a guitarist for the hot rock band known as Tailhook. While the band is doing incredibly well as the sold out concerts as they tour the world and the latest cover of Rolling Stone prove, her personal life and her future is being poured down the drain, one drink of alcohol at a time. Mim believes she is holding her own, but she isn't and one scene too many on tour has earned her the right to go home and get her act together. Van, the leader of the band, left her no choice but to go home, dry out and then they would consider bringing her back.<br />Mim flies home and almost makes it inside her house, when a gunman accosts her on her porch. He forces her to his van where he orders her to strip, takes her clothes and drives her around for awhile. Eventually, they arrive back at her place where she is allowed to dress and he vanishes into the night. Terrified and upset, she has no proof that anything happened but she will have a drink or two first and then call the Police.<br />The responding Police soon realize that she has had several drinks before they got there on top of what she had been consuming on the plane coming home. They come to the conclusion that if anything happened, and with no evidence at all of anything they don't believe her story, that it was a publicity stunt that went awry. Mim doesn't agree, hits the bottle and over the next few days realizes that someone is after her. Nude pictures of her that could only be taken in her home while she was passed out are posted on the Internet and then she is linked to a murder and extortion plot. Like her drinking, her life accelerates out of control as she struggles to hold it together and clear her name.<br />While I much prefer the Kodiak series for their intense reads, this stand alone novel works on many of the same levels. Not only is it a strong introduction to the enjoyable writings of the author if you haven't had the pleasure of reading him before, this novel weaves an increasingly complex tale at frenetic speed. As in his other enjoyable novels, the main character is multifaceted and complex with realistic problems to handle, both internally and externally. In this specific case, Greg Rucka brings Mim Bracca's compulsion to drink to life and gives it a presence that not only serves as a background to the novel but works for those who have also battled the alcoholic demon within.<br />The writing style is intense with no wasted words or long wasted expository paragraphs as the reader and characters drift aimlessly through the work. The mystery itself is never overshadowed by other things and is complex and constantly changing. Just when the reader believes the situation is figured out, the author flips everything and changes course. The result is an intense 305-page read that is a pretty good book.xtortion plot.

Wile the overall story can be highly entertaining; one expects weakness in character development, plotting, or in a host of other areas. In this case, that expectation would be totally incorrect. This dark and very well written novel weaves a complex mystery all the way to a shocking end and works on all levels.<br />Chief Ben Truman runs the very small Police force in Versailles, Maine. He never intended to be in the Police Department let alone following his father's legacy as Police Chief. Things lately haven't been working out as planned. His mother has recently died from complications of Alzheimer's and his Dad, showing signs of his own failing health, has moved in with Ben. Ben is coping with everything the best he can and his life seems to be getting increasingly complicated. Then he finds the body and from the first arrival of the big city cops, loses control of the situation.<br />The deceased is Robert Danzinger, a powerful District Attorney out of Boston. Among other cases, the deceased was going after Harold Braxton, head of the notorious Mission Posse gang operating out of Mission Felts in Boston. Ben manages to stay involved in the case and the manhunt begins as secrets from twenty years ago are slowly revealed in a hunt for justice.<br />This is a slow moving dark read that relies mostly on character development to move the story forward. Not only is the character of Ben Truman painstakingly developed, so too are the characters of most of the major as well as minor figures. As each level is built, contradictions begin that begin to cast doubt in the mind of the reader regarding everyone, including Ben.<br />Wile a couple of minor plot points are telegraphed early, for the most part, the author manages to confuse and misdirect the reader making the ending a staggering shock. Isn't that the point of reading a mystery? Keep the reader guessing, tell one heck of a story with interesting characters, and then surprise the reader with an incredible ending. That is exactly what he does and why it makes this one well worth the read.with interesting characters, and then surprise the reader with an incredible ending.

Collins	Kelsey Waite is a single mother doing the best she can and trying desperately to put the abuse she suffered at the hands of her parents and others behind her. She has promised herself as well as her young daughter Tia that she will be a better Mom than her Mom was to her. Thanks to Mrs. Rampton who watches her daughter after school and her Aunt who left her the beachside cottage in her will, as well as to her own inner strength, Kelsey is making it happen each and every day. That is until her daughter, in every parent's nightmare, is taken from school.<br />Kelsey awakens three days later to find herself in the middle of a living nightmare. The police are stumped, Mrs. Rampton has been brutally murdered and Tia is long gone. The woman who took her claimed to be Kelsey's sister. Much like not having a childhood, Kelsey never had a biological sister. But, she begins to wonder if it could be a \\"sister\\" in the form of address towards another woman as used in the Mormon church of her youth. Detective Quinn Anderson is assigned the case and there is something that leads Kelsey to trust him.<br />She confides her horrifically abusive past to him involving her parents and a fanatical cult offshoot of the Mormon Church.  Pushed by his questions, Kelsey attempts to contact her estranged parents only to find out they have been banished from the Mormon Church and have left, in all likelihood joining the fanatical cult. With a cult bent on fulfilling what it sees as biblical prophecy involving the end of the world, Kelsey and Quinn unite in a mission to end the cycle of abuse by bringing Tia back home where she belongs.<br />Intense and riveting, this is a very suspenseful novel. Different aspects of the Mormon Church and other sub groups within the church are brought forward and explained to the average reader. This is done with style and even handed balance in regards to the Mormon Church and never in a lecturing or condescending tone.<br />At the same time, the characters are multifaceted and while the culprits are identified early, the complex motivations and the scope of the possible ramifications are not. The reader is left with an intense, entertaining and sometimes very disturbing story featuring characters pushed literally to the edge of madness and physical ability to survive as well as numerous questions regarding religious faith taken to the extreme.

At night in Boston, he spots a man that he knows shouldn't be walking around alive get into a car and drive off. Back when Reacher was a military cop running investigations Francis Xavier Quinn was as dirty as they came and had allegedly died. Apparently he is alive, driving off before Reacher can stop him and all he has is the plate to work with to find him again.<br />Reacher tries to use his old contacts to find the owner of the license plate but it has been years since he was in the service. Instead, he gets in deeper with the arrival of two Federal Agents who want to know why he is asking questions. They have researched Reacher extensively and believe that he is the kind of person who just might be able to help them. Francis Xavier Quinn who Reacher wants desperately for reasons gradually explained throughout the entire novel through the use of flashbacks, is part of a larger group that the Federal Agents have been going after.  Their problem is that their investigation is a rogue operation and as such off the books and does not exist. They can't bring in anyone connected to law enforcement without getting into major trouble and now one of their own, an undercover officer, has gone missing and they have no idea where she is now. They strike a deal with Reacher that in exchange for finding their agent they will allow him to hunt down Quinn.<br />Reacher goes undercover and begins a shadowy game of intrigue where nothing is as it seems. Full of the usual twists and turns created by Lee Child in his novels; this latest book in the series is another intense enjoyable read. Well written for the most part despite one very stupid and clich&eacute;d scene towards the end, this book reflects a coldness of character not seen in Jack Reacher in the earlier novels.<br />Reacher has always been portrayed as a distant, loner type individual who values his privacy and keeps his human attachments to a minimum. However, the cold tone extends throughout the book. Even in a couple of love making scenes, which seem to be inserted as gratuity and not plot development, his character remains cold and detached.<br />However, that is a minor quibble and may reflect nothing more than the ongoing story arc, which transcends several of the novels in the series. As in any complex series, the reader who starts from the very beginning, \\"Killing Floor,\\" will enjoy this book the most.

Those that know something of me from my reviews here and elsewhere know that I am not a big fan of fantasy. With the exception of Terry Goodkind, most fantasy seems to me to be redundant and boring. Then I received this very enjoyable novel from the author. She has penned a grand tale of palace intrigue and deceit, sinister forces unleashed in a world of fantasy, and more than anything, the power of romance. This novel works across all levels and a fantasy setting only serves in improve the novel as to have done anything else would diminish the work.<br />Simplifying greatly, King Edrick of Abernal died at the afore mentioned feast. The only reason King Edrick was even having a wedding feast was that the previous Queen who he could not divorce because of extreme financial penalties, has finally died. He banished her to the far reaches of the Kingdom years ago and with word of her death, it is time for another political marriage. He must have a son, legitimate, preferably since all the illegitimate children are dead, to take over his Kingly duties someday. Upon word of the Queen's death, plans are quickly made for King Edrick to marry Yolanthe of Nadwich, the young daughter of King Benifaz. Upon meeting King Edrick, she is clearly less than thrilled with the repulsive idea but is powerless to stop it.<br />As it turns out, she is spared consummating the marriage with King Edrick thanks to his sudden death. The only living heir, known as The Ugly Princess and the spawn of a previous political union is needed to keep the throne in the family.  She is rumored to be hideously deformed but since killing her wasn't an option, she has lived for the last twenty years at the far edges of the empire in a keep high in the foothills. There she is attended to by trolls, the only ones who can deal with her vulgar appearance.<br />Knowing that the ministers of the Royal Court seek to consolidate their power and have her killed, the Royal Champion Sir Christopher Evergild, leaves to bring her back. As the next rightful holder of the throne, he will swear an oath of fealty to her and then return her to the castle and the throne that is rightfully hers. At the same time, Bartrim Ruford, Seneschal of House Rediman is left to deal with King Benifaz's attempt to claim King Edrick's vacant throne as his as well as the political machinations of traitors within the palace walls that seek their own power.<br />Shifting in viewpoint from Bartrim to Sir Christopher, the novel is an enjoyable tale of palace intrigue where the dark forces may not all be mankind's making. Featuring complex characters, plenty of action and twists, humor and romance, this novel keeps the reader enthralled as it works toward the inevitable confrontations on many different levels.

While this review simply does not do the book justice, do not let that deter you from this very good read which appears to be the start of a possible series.	2003-12-04

It was a crummy way to start a vacation.\\" (Page 19)<br />Being a police officer and a target of a smart killer with a score to settle has long been a hallmark of police oriented mystery fiction. However, rarely has it been done so well as in this novel, latest in the series featuring Kevin Kerney.<br />With Lieutenant Colonel Sara Brannon, his wife, home on maternity leave from the Army, Santa Fe Police Chief Kevin' Kerney's thoughts involve the construction of their new home and the pending arrival almost any day of his son. He is supposed to be on an often delayed and much needed vacation. That is until the killings begin.<br />First it is a prominent attorney, Jack Potter who is shot in the chest and left to die on the sidewalk in front of the county court house. Then Kerney finds his beloved horse, Soldier, dead after being shot three times in the stomach. Then the dead rats and the notes threatening Kerney and his family begin to appear. Killing Kerney fast wouldn't bring the pleasure of making him suffer, as he will while the killer circles closer and closer killing innocent victims. As the killer moves closer, targeting his family and the body count climbs, Kerney and his investigative team lag far behind until the final inevitable violent confrontation.<br />As in most novels of this type the reader is quickly introduced to the killer. The action and the viewpoint move constantly back and forth between the killer, Kerney and other characters. As such there is zero suspense as to who the killer is. What is unknown are the reasons why and whether or not he can be stopped in time.<br />Why this novel works and works so well is the fact that as he has done in his other novels the author once again continues to build on the complex characters already established while creating a complicated mystery with multiple storylines. That coupled with his usual strong sense of pacing, action, and the occasional twist creates another page tuner in the best sense of the concept. This simply may be his best book yet in the series, which just keeps getting better and better.oupled with his usual strong sense of pacing, action, and the occasional twist creates another page tuner in the best sense of the concept.

Because I was black, I was expected to defend for the cause: to make whites understand who black American were.<br />I didn't want to go to war any more than a young man does, one who is torn from his family in one country, and then forced to kill and maim citizens in another country. I didn't care about the cause because I'd been waging my own battle to save my life. How I defined myself as a brown-skinned human in a world of light-skinned humans was irrelevant to me. Always I wondered, what does it matter?\\" (Page 13)<br />For Donna Leonard Conger, race and politically correct labels have never mattered. What has always mattered is family and personal identity and she recounts her struggles with both in this book.<br />Opening with an explanation of her grandparents, the author recounts the history of her family briefly while detailing family values and perseverance in the face of adversity. Work ethics, education, manners, spirituality, and various other values, drove the Leonard family. Race was not an issue and they never saw it as what defined them, individually or as a family.<br />But \\"Our relatives often said we sounded funny. My mother would not allow lazy speech. If we told someone that we needed to ask a question then we asked it, and did not \\"'axe'\\" it.\\" (Page 17) Proper speech and manners were stressed in the Leonard home and while relatives as she grew up in the sixties and seventies, thought she sounded funny, classmates were downright cruel. Because she judged people by what they were and not their race, she was never part of the crowd. The resulting pressure to conform by members of her own race was immense and troubling for her. She didn't fit in with the white world and she didn't fit in with the black world.<br />At the same time, the author felt a conflict with her family as she wasn't self assured or confident in herself and felt a need to please others. While blacks saw her as a traitor to her race her own mother saw her as a traitor to her family. Slowly she began to realize that her mother was abusive and began to deal with the issue.<br />Moving back and forth between the present and the past, the author recounts her search for personal identity and family healing. She writes of issues between the races and within the black community, her divorce, and other matters in this ninety-four page book. Through it all, the duality of themes of pain and hope comes through loud and clear and becomes a clarion call for faith and perseverance in life.<br />In the interests of fair disclosure, I first met the author via the mail a few years ago when she was publishing a small magazine entitled Show and Tell. At one point, one of my stories graced the pages of her magazine and it seems rather ironic that a few years later and because of the Internet, we were able to reestablish contact. While we may be of opposite genders and races, after all these years, we still have quite a lot in common and her book is well worth the read.r own mother saw her as a traitor to her family.

J. Box brings Wyoming Game Warden Joe Pickett back for another intense adventure. Showing the same sense of style and ability to weave a complex entertaining tale as he did in his first two books, this novel builds further on the deep characters involved and culminates in a shocking and disturbing conclusion for fans of this series.<br />As the novel opens, an early winter storm is bearing down on Battle Mountain in 12 Sheep County, Wyoming. Game Warden Joe Picket is on the mountain on patrol. He has recently seen a truck in the area and knows that at least one hunter is up on the mountain somewhere with him and most likely seeking an elk before the pending storm hits. Warden Pickett earlier had seen an elk herd also in the vicinity so the hunter may be in luck. Then as the sky darkens and the snow begins, Warden Pickett hears gunfire. Gunfire that seems to continue long after one elk should have been hit which means the hunter might actually be a poacher.<br />Warden Pickett soon finds that the herd he saw earlier has been massacred. Bodies of elk, dead or dying are strewn in a small meadow and the shooter is Lamar Gardiner, head of the United Sates Forest Service for the area. When Gardiner is confronted, he seems not to realize what he has done and is erratic in his responses. Warden Pickett takes him into custody and as they begin the multi hour journey back down the mountain out of the blizzard, Gardiner becomes increasingly deranged in word and actions. Somehow, he manages to escape leaving Warden Picket to go after him in the snowstorm. Eventually, Warden Picket finds Gardiner, dying, and pinned to a tree after being shot through by two arrows.<br />The loss of his suspect and subsequent murder once again make Joe the laughing stick of the local Sheriff's Department. But in a parallel story line, Warden Pickett has more pressing personal matters to attend to. While he wants to figure out why Gardiner did what he did and who killed him, he faces the loss of his foster daughter, April. April's mother who abandoned her three years ago leaving her alone and taken in by Warden Pickett and his family suddenly returns to Saddlestring. The adoption hasn't been finalized and now her mother is back and wants April back. Even though her mother is part of a group of anti federal extremists camping in the local forest, they are powerless to stop her mother from taking her back because she has a court order. Warden Pickett, a member of law enforcement is torn apart as he watches the system he is sworn to uphold disintegrate in his face because he can't protect April and a killer roams free.<br />Along with his usual intense writing, complicated characters, strong sense of pacing and another great mystery, the author once again weaves in numerous details of how the public lands are being protected or not as the case may be by those sworn to protect the nation's fragile resource. As always, C. J. Box brings the beauty of the Wyoming Mountains alive for his readers along with his characters. This third book is another in what seems to be building into a great series. As such they should be read in order from the beginning as noted and those that do will get more out of the intense and shocking ending of this novel.figure out why Gardiner did what he did and who killed him, he faces the loss of his foster daughter, April.

Earth comes only once.\\"<br />A key component of the fantasy genre is the quest and a quest makes up most of this enjoyable novel by Marilyn Peake. Designed for the pre-teen reader, this novel revolves around Wiley O'Mara, son a local fisherman.<br />Wiley lives on an unspecified island high in the North Atlantic. A killing fever has swept through the village community he calls home taking many lives. His mother lies gravely ill and without any help from his alcoholic father, he tends to her the best he can. The long illness and vigil have taken a toll on him and despite his best efforts and intentions, he falls asleep during one long winter night. He awakens the next morning to find his father gone, most likely either at sea fishing or on another alcoholic binge and his mother dead.<br />The weight of local custom falls heavily upon his shoulders. A wake must be held and the nearest priest is in the next village. The quickest and most direct route is through the neighboring forest, which is the lair of a dangerous multi eyed beast. Wiley at twelve years old is determined to honor his Mother's memory as required, and sets out to reach the next village. Before long he confronts the beast deep in the forest as well as other creatures that seem imbued with magical properties. He also has a vision of a lovely woman floating in time and space with a message for him and him alone.<br />Not only must he get to the village and bring back the priest for his Mother's wake, there is another task to be done through the use of magic. He has the power with in himself as well as through the aid of other creatures to help people from a time long past once again breath free.<br />This rich, fun read is perfect for the pre-teen reader. There is a minimum of violence, plenty of action and historical lessons, as well as an appreciation of nature, beauty and magic.  Wiley learns empathy for others as well as an appreciation of the world around him, past and present. He also learns responsibility as well as the need to follow through no matter how difficult the task to achieve the goal.<br />This novel reminded me strongly of \\"The Magic Tree House Series.\\" There is that same wonder and joy at exploring the unknown as well as a balance between magic and reality.

While this novel can be read separately from the series, those readers that read them in order from the very beginning will appreciate this novel more as several minor storylines are addressed.<br />March is still cold on Martha's Vineyard and the tourists haven't started arriving just yet. This year was no exception but things are already stirred up. The permanent residents are riled up and for very good reason. Real estate developer Donald Fox is attempting to buy up local property not because the owners want to sell, but because he has the bucks to make it happen. He wants to put a large package of land together and then sell that to someone else. If folks won't willingly sell for a fraction of what their land is worth, he will force court fights over the often-dubious land deeds. He thinks he can make a killing and does not care how he does it.<br />That is until J. W. Jackson and the lovely Zee watch from a local diner as shots are fired at Donald and his more humane brother, Paul. The shooter manages to get away in the blowing snow as Paul lies wounded in the street. Paul survives the attack and J.W. soon turns down the resulting job offer. He does not like Donald or his company and as a matter of principle wants nothing more to do with them.  But soon, as he begins to investigate things on another unrelated matter, he finds that Donald and his company seem to be involved in everything and that J. W. has unwittingly made himself a target.<br />This is another very good book from Philip R. Craig. While no new ground is covered in regards to these characters, there are no unpleasant surprises either. Everyone is back in their usual roles and as always, a couple of recipes are found in the back of the book.<br />In a refreshing change from the last several novels, Joshua and Diana (the children) are not part of the investigation. Safely in school and off the printed page, they are not unrealistically taken to crime scenes as in recent novels. In fact, in direct contradiction to the last several novels, the children are hardly heard from at all.<br />In addition to all but eliminating the children, this novel is tightly plotted and moves at a better pace than the last several. Craig continues the use of two ongoing storylines that crossover and link to each other frequently throughout the novel and this practice works considerably better in this one. The action moves forward at a much better pace and the twin storylines have more depth than those in recent novels.<br />In short, this is a very good book and a definite step up from the last several.

One of the things I try to do is give the family some variety, as much as my skills will allow as well as taking into account everyone's particular preferences. Most cookbooks have recipes that are either way beyond my culinary skills or contain food that no one in this family will eat. This book was a pleasant change from the norm and one that I could actually use.<br />With a lot of humor in mind, this cookbook is designed to help the reader create good food that everyone will eat with a minimum of preparation time or cost. The author weaves in numerous anecdotes about his life and cooking experiences since he left home more than thirty years ago. Often amusing, these stories do not detract at all from the most important part of any cookbook-the recipes.<br />There are fifty-six suggested meals that run the gamut from the very simple (how to pan fry a steak) to something more complicated like Bulghur Pilaf. While I am not going to detail each one, each menu is of real food with real portions as opposed to something incredibly complicated as shown on the Food Network that can be finished in two bites. Throughout the menus, variety, healthy additions, and other general tips are stressed.<br />Cooking should be fun and the author heartily embraces the concept while imparting a lot of experience. This is a very good and realistic cookbook and is far different from the normal cookbook.  It is well worth owning and would be perfect as a gift for the young adult moving away from home or for the chief cook and bottle washer in your home.	2003-11-10

However, after previously reading and reviewing \\"All White Girls\\" and \\"Deadly Campaign\\" by Michael Bracken, I was very interested in reading this anthology, which he edited. I certainly wasn't disappointed.<br />Dispensing with the usual multi page editor's commentary so often found in anthologies, Editor Bracken allows the reader to delve straight into the works. He selected fourteen stories featuring very different writing styles, but all geared towards the dark shadows of human nature.  Each story has a twist at the end as well as in most cases, using food as a theme in one way or another.<br />This is especially true in the story titled \\"Munchies\\" by Jack Bludis. The narrator is out on the town with his girlfriend Sheila after seeing a double feature of  \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" and \\"The Big Sleep.\\" They go to a local bar and by happenstance meet another couple. Before long, the story goes off in an unexpected direction and the narrator finds out more about himself and Sheila than he ever would have thought.<br />Stephen D. Rogers also works the food theme in a story that goes to unexpected places entitled \\"Tough Guy.\\" (He has another story in the book titled \\"Cheating Heart\\" as well). The narrator sits down with a kidnapper to negotiate on behalf of the victim and the family over a meal.  The kidnapper thinks he has everything under control and for him, is sadly mistaken.<br />Then there is \\"Holiday Bonus\\" by Nick Andreychuk featuring Private Investigator Earl Stack. Someone has been skimming money and Earl has checked everywhere and can't find the money. Everywhere that is except for the holiday turkeys, one per employee, that are supposed to be given out on Friday. Earl had needs of his own and a turkey with all the trimmings would hit the spot.<br />While I would like to go into great detail concerning each of the other eleven stories that make up this anthology, I can't because of space limitations. However, before you believe that everything in this book is doom and gloom, I have to mention the humor often involved in these works. Several authors have very funny lines in the course of their story, but Linda Summers Posey's story is funny from start to finish.<br />In \\"Who Put The Armadillo In The Avocado Dip?\\" Posey writes a funny tale concerning a fundraiser held by the Alliance of Animal Advocates in Houston, Texas. The narrator is working for Mat Martin Investigations has been hired as security for the fundraiser as well as to protect mattress king Walt Waters during his appearance before the group. But, there is a power struggle within the leadership of the alliance and not everything is right about Walt. I can't do this one any justice as it simply has to be read to be appreciated.<br />In addition to the authors mentioned above, Tom Sweeney, Dan Sontup, Art Montague, Carol Kilgore, Andrew McAleer, Dorothy Rellas, Kenneth Thornton Samuels and Robert Lopresti all have stories in the book. Each story in the anthology is good and each showcases the author's own style and voice. Each author plants one if not more twists in the story and packs a lot in the few short pages allowed.

To bring justice to those who have killed and some measure of comfort, no matter how small to the victims left behind as survivors.  When he retired, he took his watch and his files and thought his mission was over.<br />Instead, while he does not have the authority of the badge any more, he realizes as time passes that the mission remains. In particular, a case from a four year old unsolved murder begins to work its way into his mind. Angella Benton, an employee of Eidon Productions, was found dead in the vestibule of her apartment building. Bosch was assigned the case and was working it days later on a movie set when the set was robbed of two million dollars during a brazen daylight robbery shootout. Bosch would wound one robber, none of whom were ever caught, and the money was never found. After the robbery and the resulting high profile glare of the media, the Benton case was pulled from Bosch and folded into the robbery investigation and given to two detectives from Robbery Homicide. Days later, while eating lunch, one of the detectives was killed and the other permanently paralyzed in a robbery at a neighborhood bar.<br />That was a death knell for the case as cops are a superstitious lot and there are always new cases that demand immediate attention. But Bosch without a badge is just as aggressive as he was when he carried the shield. He may be retired, but he still goes at it the only way he knows how and soon seems to have antagonized his former bosses as well as other parties. Before long, old friends are annoyed, a federal terrorism task force is involved and unhappy, as well as numerous other shadowy figures. Once again, violence comes home in more ways than one, but no matter what, Bosch won't stop.<br />As in the other novels of this enjoyable series, Connelly looks deep into the dark abyss that lurks within everyone where life is cheap and greed in the moment wins out over human decency. At the same time, by using an unexpected plot twist, one of several at the end, Harry is redeemed and temporarily at least, finds the peace and solace he has sought for in novel after novel.<br />While this book reads like it might be the final one in the Harry Bosch series, which has had one heck of a run, I hope not. If it is, Michael Connelly has fittingly ended the series by exploring and further developing his signature character. He has done so in new and unexpected ways while adding plenty of action, an intriguing core mystery as well as additional secondary storylines, and a fine plot.

The result ultimately works in that it keeps the reader tuning the page but this reader certainly missed Sharon.<br />Fourteen years ago, days before they were to be divorced, Gwen Lindstrom vanished. As happens in most cases where disappearance and/or foul play is suspected, suspicion quickly fell on the unlucky spouse. In this case, it was Mathew Lindstrom that became an object of law enforcement and media interest. The fact that he initially lied to police about his whereabouts didn't help. That mistake brought increased police scrutiny in his small town and eventually national media interest. The resulting investigations and media presence destroyed his life, as he knew it.<br />Eventually, several years later, he wound up in Vancouver, British Columbia running a small charter boat business. That is until he got an anonymous call telling him that his wife is alive and happy while living well in Cyanide Wells, California. Before hanging up, his caller assures him that she knew full well what she was doing when she vanished leaving him to be investigated for her murder and enjoyed it.<br />Matt packs up everything and hits the road to Cyanide Wells. He has to see her for himself and he wants a confrontation with her as well as photographic evidence of her existence so that he can clear his name. While he gets a few pictures, before he can do much more, she flees from the area and takes her young daughter with her. Her lover, Carly McGuire is just as devastated as Matt was years ago. The two unite to find Gwen, her child, and the answers to several mysteries regarding Gwen as well as trying to figure out what is the cause of several seemingly unrelated strange events in the small town.<br />This is a slow moving book that alternately switches in point of view from Matt to Carly and back again. At times this shift is very disconcerting because the shift comes at times involving the few allegedly intense scenes. The shift is jarring and each time it happens the reader is reminded of how shallow this book is and that it is not a Sharon McCone mystery.<br />Some character development is involved but mostly this is tale of how little we know of the past or even the real present thinking or actions of the ones we love. Instead of being used to build characters, these contrary tidbits of information are just used as words to replace existing information. Our understanding of the makeup of the shallow characters is changed but after all is said and done, the same shallow characters remain.<br />These facts along with the fact that this mystery is not only slow to unravel but fairly obvious from about the midpoint on the work on make this an average read at best.at times involving the few allegedly intense scenes.

Both the children and adult characters are presented as being human with realistic problems and mannerisms. While some of the parents depicted as less than ideal, none are just over the top stupid as is so common these days in novels and the media. In this novel, no one talks down to another character, which is also a refreshing change of pace.<br />The novel is well written with plenty of clues to go along to help the reader decode the mystery. The Asperger's syndrome is handled well and with compassion.  The Duchess has her limitations but at the same time, because of her situation she has unique talents that are celebrated in the novel. With more books on the way, if they are done as well, this should be a wonderful new series.	2003-11-05

For Scarpetta who is virtually oblivious to the world, all that really matters is that her love, FBI agent Benton Wesley is dead.<br />Scarpetta has never recovered from the twin psychological traumas of the brutal attack by Jean-Baptiste Chandonne and the death of Benton. It all was too much for her and she has started running. She fled her meticulous home in Richmond Virginia where she nearly died. She fled the firestorm and media circus surrounding her former job in Virginia and now lives in a small rent house that she does not care for in Florida and does some consulting work. But she can't run from the sorrow and grief she feels over the death of Benton that haunts her every waking moment and many of her dreams as well. She goes through the motions but she isn't living and it is destroying those that care about her such as Rose, Pete, and Lucy.<br />At the same time, a serial killer is working in Louisiana. A killer that may indirectly tie into a case from eight years ago as well as being currently active. At the request of the local coroner, Kay consults on the case from eight years ago as well as the current situation and unwittingly wanders into an elaborate puzzle of death where she is just a pawn in something much bigger and isn't in control.<br />Unfortunately for the reader, author Patricia Cornwell isn't really in control of her novel either. As a fan, I was hugely disappointed in this read. Not only has her style continued to change, which I could live with, but the incredibly melancholy and depressing tone of her last several books continues. Not a single character is emotionally balanced or even happy on any level. Furthermore, the read itself is highly disjointed with constant pov shifts, short chapters of little or no substance, and extraneous writing that does nothing to advance the book. The first two hundred plus pages of this 465-page novel are incredibly slow moving and Cornwell subjects the reader to extensive wallowing in the futility of each character's life.  This maybe to set the mood for what comes later but if so, by this point, the reader is drowning in mood.<br />Then, there is the ending. Without blowing the book suffice it to say that the central issue, the point that the whole book revolves around, remains unsolved and left hanging wide open. Maybe this was done on purpose as Cornwell could be pursuing a story arc or trilogy of sorts within the confines of the existing series where she will resolve it in her next book. Or maybe it was just a sloppy and easy way out. I don't know, of course, which is the answer or if it is something in between. But after slogging through 465 pages I expect an actual ending that solves the central question the book is written around.y disjointed with constant pov shifts, short chapters of little or no substance, and extraneous writing that does nothing to advance the book.

Lucas has moved on along with his boss Rose Marie Roux. Leaving a nasty political situation in their old jobs, Rose Marie with the strong blessings of the Governor has created a special situation for him. Officially he is designated as \\"Director, Office of Regional Studies\\" which is buried within the State Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.\\" But Lucas is not a desk jockey. He is a hands on investigator, and in reality, he is to be the Governor's fix it person when crime cases become too complicated or too political for local jurisdictions to handle.<br />This will be the first case for the newly formed unit headed by Lucas and it seems to have all the ingredients for a major media firestorm. Two people, one female and white, one male and black, have been found dead near Armstrong, Minnesota. Not just murdered, but bound, nude, and hanging from trees. Lynching is an ugly word and describing an ugly practice and the Governor wants the case solved fast.<br />But the case isn't solved fast and is just a small segment of a fast deteriorating situation in Armstrong. Because of Lucas and his partner, Del's investigation in Armstrong, pressure begins to come down on numerous persons in the same town. Various schemes interwoven and also independent of the original case begin to emerge and unravel and a bloodbath begins in the frozen north during the dark of winter.<br />This book once again reminds the reader of how well a mystery can be done when the author takes the time to write a first class novel. While some authors are content to crank out a quick shallow read every few months, Sandford continues to evolve the Lucas character as well as create a complex mystery in novel after novel. A lot of changes have occurred over the course of this series for Lucas and it clear that quite a few more are in order in the next novel and ones to come.<br />In the meantime, as in most of the other novels of the series, the writing and imagery is intense and the sense of pacing is just right. Sandford steadily raises the tension level while occasionally giving the reader a glimpse of the twisted humor he is known for. This series is alive and very well and definitely well worth the read.vel and ones to come.<br />In the meantime, as in most of the other novels of the series, the writing and imagery is intense and the sense of pacing is just right.

The Police believe it was a robbery that went too far but Diane is convinced that her mother was murdered. She wants Katie to investigate.<br />This is a new career and lifestyle for Katie as she works to put several painful events of the past behind her.

Along the trail as she seeks a murderer, she will find romance, politics and environmental issues as well as a host of suspects that had a personal stake in the life and death of Alexa Chitting.<br />At 245 pages in hardback, this is a fast read with a minimum of violence. \\"Cozy\\" in every sense of the word, Dorothy Francis spins a world where self interest led to murder in the island paradise of Key West.

But his personal life as well as his family business have taken their respective hits lately and he feels a bit depressed. Wilson Industries is a conglomeration of various companies in several diverse fields and some of the individual pieces have taken some serious setbacks.<br />Half a country away, Kelly McClusky senses the end is near for her charity in Brookstone, Wisconsin. Her brainchild, Second Life Center, dedicated to those less fortunate in memory of her deceased love Mark Reid is having severe financial problems. Like Dan and his situation with the family business, her charity has been her sole existence for many years and the idea that it is all crumbling is emotionally devastating.<br />Along with their financial problems as head of their respective organizations, they share a common past. Twenty years ago, Dan was the star quarterback, Kelly was the beautiful head cheerleader, and Marl Reid was the flashy wide receiver. Then, the magic for all of them died when Mark smashed into a tree and the old friends drifted apart. That is until a letter, which had been undelivered for over twenty years, finally makes its way to Dan bringing about a multi month cathartic process.<br />Against a backdrop of Packer Football and Venture Capitalism, this novel tells the story of Dan, Kelly and others at a pivotal moment in their lives. In each case, the person is being pushed to the edge by forces not of his or her control and finds a way to survive the abyss and discover what truly matters.<br />As first time novelists, Brian Hill and Dee Power have written a novel heavily vested with their love of Packer football, past and present, as well as their experiences on the business world regarding venture capitalism. As in other first novels, the in-depth characterizations as well as sheer number of characters tend to be a bit excessive at times and the dialogue is a bit unrealistic at times. However, these are minor quibbles and may reflect more on reviewer preferences than on the actual novel itself.<br />Driven by extensive multiple characterizations, this novel begins slowly as events begin to spiral out of control and take their toll on the characters involved. As the novel moves forward and gradually picks up the pace, the characters involved rely on their own untapped inner strength and prove that once again, David can take on Goliath and not only win, but enjoy doing it.is a bit unrealistic at times.

This latest Stone Barrington novel starts as so many have before with Stone dining out at his favorite restaurant, Elaine's. Stone is known for his expensive tastes and his routines, so despite having his cell phone off, it is little trouble for managing partner of Woodman &amp; Weld, Bill Eggers, to find him. As \\"of counsel\\" to the firm, Stone occasionally provides legal work on cases where the firm would prefer not to be public participants. Bill has an assignment for Stone and it involves Elena Marks.<br />Stone wrote a prenuptial agreement for the very rich Elena Marks a year ago. In it, her soon to be husband Lawrence Fortescue forfeited all rights and claims to her money if he committed adultery. Elena is convinced that he is and wants proof that will stand up in divorce court in New York so that she can enforce the prenup. Bill Eggers wants Stone to make it happen and wants it done fast with a minimum of fuss and does not want to know anything as to how it was accomplished.<br />It has been years since Stone had to have this sort of thing done and soon has ample cause to regret hiring the nephew of a friend to be the photographer. Lawrence is dead, the photographer is arrested for murder, the client as well as the law firm are very annoyed, and agents of British Intelligence as well as elite female assassin are also involved and unhappy.  The female assassin believes that the resulting public fiasco has compromised her anonymity and blames Stone, making him a target.<br />This novel is slightly above the usual Stone Barrington fare. While Stone is his usual super studly self in relation to the ladies as he dashes here and there among the other shallow characters working the case, he does ask the occasional hard moral question. A recurring theme seems to be what is the moral responsibility of those that act out a nation's foreign policy harming and even killing innocents and guilty alike? Other questions are also raised, but those moments are brief and with no easy answers, easily swept aside by Stuart Woods.<br />The reader is left with the usual Stone Barrington novel. Stone is loved by all the women of the world and loved very well in often very graphic fashion throughout the book. Always admired and respected by men, enemies or friends, his advice is sought after and always of wise counsel. Throughout it all, without a hair out of place or a line in his very expensive suit, he has a smashingly good time (except for the very brief moral outrage parts). In the end, as before in his other novels, he is James Bond without all the high-tech toys, but with Dino always at his side to provide legal authority at the point of a police officer's service weapon, he does not need the gadgets. Another pure escapist read and as such, which does not pretend to be anything else, it is good stuff.easy answers, easily swept aside by Stuart Woods.<br />The reader is left with the usual Stone Barrington novel.

At the opposite end of the spectrum from lightweight Robert B. Parker type work is author G. M. Ford. First with the Leo Waterman series and now with the Frank Corso series, his novels consistently feature multidimensional characters, complicated plots and intense writing. This is the third novel in the Frank Corso series and is simply an intense spellbinding read that occasionally is highly disturbing in its background themes of death and child abuse. If you haven't read him before, you really need to read FURY and Black River before you read this one as they lay the foundation for the Corso character.<br />As the novel opens, Corso and his good friend Meg Dougherty are stuck at Chicago's O'Hare Airport thanks to a blizzard. The blizzard rages outside while a very frustrated Corso rages within which is not a good thing in this day of terror alerts and increased security concerns at the nation's airports. Being a disgruntled angry passenger has consequences these days and he can't afford them. Corso needs to leave as there is a warrant out for his arrest and his warrant has now caught the attention of the cable news outlets.<br />A Grand Jury in Texas issued the arrest warrant because in his latest true crime book, author Frank Corso claimed to know where a body in Texas was buried. Unfortunately, his source that told him that he knew has now vanished so Corso has nothing to tell the Grand Jury. If the Texas Rangers find and arrest him, he can be held indefinitely on a \\"material witness\\" charge. But if he can remain uncaught for a little more than a week, the Grand Jury will dissolve and with no Grand Jury, the warrant for his arrest will become void and unenforceable. Then he can go back home to Seattle and let his attorney handle it without fear of arrest.<br />In the meantime, with his picture popping up every few minutes on various cable stations on airport televisions, it is past time to leave. Since planes are out of the question, Corso and Dougherty rent an SUV and venture out into the blizzard. That small acts sets in motion a nightmarish discovery of the legacy of a very sick serial killer, a man hunt involving the FBI as well as other law enforcement types, crooked cops, and a string of bodies and destruction in their wake.<br />This novel is extremely intense and occasionally disturbingly graphic in depictions of death and child abuse. More of the Corso character is revealed as well as his good friend Meg Dougherty. However, the author never lets the character development get in the way of the intense, griping story.  This is a real page tuner that will get your blood pounding as the book works toward one heck of an ending. While I much prefer the Leo Waterman character, the intense and complex enigma of Frank Corso is fast becoming a real<br />favorite.UV and venture out into the blizzard.

The idea of a \\"vast right wing conspiracy\\" is used as background in Stuart Woods's latest book, titled \\"Capital Crimes.\\" Labeled on the cover as well as on the jacket copy as being about his character Will Lee, it isn't. Will Lee is in the book, occasionally, as President of the Untied States as well as other characters readers have seen before in other books. Will Lee isn't the focus nor is he the one leading the investigation as is claimed on the misleading jacket copy. Instead, as President, he wants the job done and occasionally approves actions taken by Robert Kinney.<br />The novel revolves around Robert Kinney, the Deputy Director for Crimminal Investigations in the FBI. Not only is his boss the Director of the FBI, James Heller, portrayed as a political appointee and an idiot who impedes the investigation, he also has the problem of tracking down a killer in the glare of the media spotlight. The killer is a brilliant tactician who is now using his vast skills to kill prominent conservatives by various methods. He has targeted politicians, media pundits and others because he believes that they are obstructionist and preventing America from becoming a great nation once again. Not only is he doing a favor for the sitting President, as he sees it, he is saving America from enemies within. One by one, he is killing than and despite having his target list via his website, they can't find him or protect those on the list.<br />This book is better than normal Stuart Woods. Not only is the writing slightly more intense than normal as is the plotting, there is some actual character development in this novel. Robert Kinney is a character with interesting possibilities and I suspect will be spun off into a new series. It seems to have all the hallmark Woods signals that this could happen especially in the light of the misleading jacket copy and the fact that the Will Lee character as drawn has done just about everything he can logically do. For him to make another appearance as the actual focus of a novel would require fundamental character restructuring which is not something Stuart Woods has done in the past with characters such as Stone Barrington, Jesse Stone and others too numerous to mention.<br />As in his other books featuring those characters, action is the primary component and motivation behind all elements. This fast read is almost entirely about the hunt as the pov shifts at times through other characters but primarily between Robert Kinney and the suspect. Like many of his more recent works, no deep intellectual questions are raised and the book is quickly forgettable. For what it is, sheer escapist reading, it is better than most and perfect to escape reality for a couple of hours.rance as the actual focus of a novel would require fundamental character restructuring which is not something Stuart Woods has done in the past with characters such as Stone Barrington, Jesse Stone and others too numerous to mention.<br />As in his other books featuring those characters, action is the primary component and motivation behind all elements.

Parker for deep intellectual insights into the human condition, complex characters, or intricate plots. Parker serves his purpose in providing his readers with sheer escapist reading. Books containing just enough action to entertain and keeping the reader interested while not boring anyone with that messy character development stuff. This certainly is true of his latest effort involving his recently developed character Jesse Stone.<br />As the novel opens, Paradise Massachusetts Police Chief is called to the scene of a dead body on the beach. The man, dressed in warm-ups was shot twice in the chest at fairly close range and while his identity is quickly determined, nothing else is. Jesse and his small Department have no suspects, no motive and virtually no evidence other than the fact that he was shot with two different guns, both twenty-two caliber.<br />At almost the same time, a local teenager is brutally gang raped by several of her classmates. Afraid to come forward and with a Mother more concerned about her own public image than of her daughter's well being, the case seemingly goes nowhere. That is until Jesse begins to circumvent the parents in a bid to make sure that the three he suspects did it are arrested and punished.<br />Jesse begins to split his time and resources between both cases and it quickly becomes apparent that in the case of the murder, he has a pair of thrill killers working in his town. They are very skilled at what they do and their targets are completely at random with nothing linking them at all. At the same time, his efforts in the rape case begin to slowly pay off and he inches ever closer to making the parties responsible pay.<br />Despite the very misleading book jacket copy, Jesse is never out of control and if anything, is in better emotional shape than normal in this novel. While his battle against alcoholism goes on with little change, as does his personal situation with his ex-wife Jenn, these aren't new problems as they have been around in each preceding novel and addressed throughout. Nothing is new or different in these situations and in fact, is rather expected as they point to established weaknesses in the character as originally created.<br />However, there are two major problems with this book beyond the formulaic issues. First the gratuitous use of the f word as well as its accompanying descriptions of casual sex. Jesse in this novel beds several women all of whom have successful careers and know of his many times stated love for his ex wife and seemingly don't care. As one character so eloquently puts it, she is happy as long as Jesse and her can be \\"...f*** buddies.\\" One is reminded of the studly actions of Stuart Wood's character Stone Barrington and one is not impressed.<br />The other major problem is the appallingly open ending for this novel. While the cases are resolved, other issues are suddenly raised in the last two pages and not addressed. While I can't go into detail without ruining this book for potential readers, it is extremely hard to determine whether or not this is the last of the Jesse Stone novels or if the author is just trying to shake things up for his readers. If it is the former, it should have been made clearer to the reader. If the latter, it is a cheap trick and his readers deserve better. In either case, it would have been nice if a little thought had been given to which implication was correct so that it could have been better clarified for the reader's sake.<br />Fans happy with the type of books Robert B.

Suffice it to say that this is a series and therefore this book should be read after the first.<br />It has been six months as this novel opens and Andy's notoriety while fading somewhat seems to be bringing him clients that he does not want. This is especially true of one perspective client, Mr. Geoffrey Stynes. Andy wants to believe his clients are innocent and in a few minutes the strange Mr. Stynes not only makes Andy afraid for his own life, but completely shatters the illusion of innocence by confessing to the gruesome murder of Alex Dorsey.<br />Alex Dorsey was a very crooked cop who apparently had connections in high places, which allowed him to get away with various activities for years. The discovery of his decapitated and burned beyond recognition body as well as the hunt for the murderer has been a major media story. Even if it weren't for the intense media coverage, Andy would know about the case thanks to his lead investigator and love interest, Laurie Collins. Laurie knew Alex was dirty and turned him to Internal Affairs. Soon she was labeled a \\"rat\\" as everyone in the Department knew what she had done. Her life as a Police Officer went downhill and when Alex Dorsey got essentially cleared of the charges; Laurie resigned in disgust several years ago. Andy isn't about to defend a confessed killer and that reason along with others, causes him to turn the case down and refuse to defend Stynes.<br />Within a matter of days, Laurie is suddenly arrested and charged with murder in the death of Alex Dorsey. Andy begins to investigate in order to defend Laurie, secure in the knowledge that she didn't do it, and begins to have major problems. Not only is he unable to locate the strange Mr. Stynes because it seems that he doesn't exist, but what little he does find out makes it clear that Laurie as well as Andy are victims of an elaborate frame. A frame that may prove impossible to break as various parties at distance from the case begins to die.<br />David Rosenfelt writes with a witty sarcastic style using various one-liners while at the same time weaving an intense thriller. His first book \\"Open And Shut\\" was very good and most of the characters involved in that book are back again in this one. His books are split between the ongoing mystery as well as courtroom drama and while he makes fun of Perry Mason style moments, he does have a few that border on the edge of that kind of situation. At the same time, his writing style gives depth and breadth to the characters and brings the major as well as minor characters to life. His books, including this one, are not peopled with stock characters but instead feature real characters that are fully drawn and evolving throughout the course of each intense book.o locate the strange Mr. Stynes because it seems that he doesn't exist, but what little he does find out makes it clear that Laurie as well as Andy are victims of an elaborate frame.

For several years now, a new range war has erupted in the western states. Despite what is claimed on a certain \\"reality\\" television show, fire is not the lifeblood of the tribe. Water is and is the issue in the modern day range war that remains out of most media coverage despite the far-reaching implications.<br />The battle over water supplies now and in the future is causing major problems in the west. Beyond the fact that former deserts now have lush golf resorts, it is a fact that as the population in major cities continues to swell, water is more and more in short supply, Since water crosses political boundaries above and below ground, it is up to nations to work out ways of accommodating the scarce supply.<br />One way of doing this is by treaty such as the one between Mexico and the United States originally enacted in 1944. Under the treaty, Mexico is to release water which would eventually flow into the Rio Grande along the Texas/Mexico border. As those of us living in Texas know, instead, despite the many promises of Mexican President Fox to do so, they haven't released the water. Because of that fact as well as a massive multi year drought, the Rio Grande has become a river in name only. Much of the year it is nothing more than a trickle at best. The drought and treaty is the backdrop for this latest effort from Allana Martin.<br />In this sixth book of the series, it has been six weeks since the death of Commissioner Zanjiv Mehendru who was head of the United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission. He had sided with Mexico in the dispute recently angering many of the locals and earning him the derisive name \\"River Master.\\" In this arid hard scrabble land around Presidio in deep Southwest Texas, his behavior as well as other actions he had undertaken were not met with appreciation and instead for many, made their lives harder as decades of behavior were suddenly against the law overnight. His death in Mexico six weeks ago was considered good riddance by many on this side of the border and still no arrest has been made.<br />That is until shortly after Texana Jones and her husband Clay, long fixtures in the border country, sit down in a restaurant with good friends, Mario and Olivia. Over dinner they discuss life in the border country until their dinner is interrupted by the arrival of several members of the Mexican Police. Clay is arrested and taken away without explanation and soon Texana learns that her mild mannered veterinarian husband has been arrested for the murder of Zanjiv Mehendru.<br />Having lived nearly all her life on the border, Texana knows that the concept of innocence or any other tenets of the United States Legal System do not exist in Mexico. Instead, under their system, the process is automatically stacked against the accused across the board on many different levels. In Clay's case, despite the fact that it can be conclusively proved he was far from the border let alone the murder site at time of death, it doesn't matter. Pressure is being brought to make sure that Clay is convicted and sentenced for the crime and proving Clay innocent isn't going to work. Instead, Texana begins to dig into the background of the victim searching for who might have done it while the pressure against her and her husband steadily mounts. Other strange events begin to occur as well which may or may not tie into Clay's problem. One that seems to get worse every day.<br />This is the sixth novel in the series and while it could be read as a stand alone (more so than earlier ones) I would not recommend doing so. Allana Martin does not write intense thrillers of page turning suspense. Instead, her books are more about the characters and the land of Southwest Texas. Each book, including this one, moves slowly forward as the author paints a deep picture of the region which changes subtly from book to book as the characters evolve. While she is not one to keep the reader glued to his or her seat,she has the ability within a few short paragraphs to transport the author into the whole other world of the border country of Southwest Texas, which she so clearly loves.<br />Which is precisely why I read her. As a native Texan who had the good fortune to be in that part of the State when I was too young to appreciate it, she has an incredible ability to bring it alive, She gets it and brings her love for the people and the curious blend of Tex-Mex culture alive. Her first book, \\"Death Of A Healing Woman\\" brought that imagery alive and every book since has built on that through great writing, ongoing character development, and a unique style all her own. She has quite a legacy at work here and serves as proof that the west and east coast driven bestseller lists often do miss quite a few very good books.she has the ability within a few short paragraphs to transport the author into the whole other world of the border country of Southwest Texas, which she so clearly loves.<br />Which is precisely why I read her.

Procurement manager and happily married he is on the way home to his wife, Kate and their daughter, Abby. As is his habit, he drives down backcountry roads at higher than posted speeds for the sheer exhilaration of it all and the lack of people to interfere. He likes to push the edge and has gotten away with it in the past.<br />That is until he is forced off the road by what initially appears to be a very reckless SUV driver. Josh's car goes airborne off the road right before a bridge and sails into the middle of the Sacramento River. Stunned by the impact but still alive Josh is faced with drowning as the car sinks because he can't swim. Trapped in the car as it slowly sinks, Josh sees the SUV driver standing on the bridge above him. Expecting help, he is horrified when the unknown driver gives him \\"a thumbs down gesture\\" reminiscent of the gladiators in the Roman Coliseum before driving away from the scene.<br />Josh survives his near drowning experience and eventually tells his story to the Police while recovering in the hospital. Outright skeptical from the start of the investigation and with little to go on, the Police dismiss it as yet another road rage incident. The stalled investigation does get some media airplay and subsequently brings him unwanted attention from his past.<br />His life as he knows it begins to dissolve as he is the target of killers who want him dead for only reasons they know and a blackmailer who hasn't made him suffer enough just yet. While the blackmailer works to end his relationship with his wife and child and to see him in jail, the killers want him dead. Slowly, Josh learns that he isn't the only target marked for death and that the blackmailer might be just the tip of the iceberg in regards to yet more problems. Other targets are being liquidated and the blackmailer is stepping up the pressure and Josh has lost all control over his life and may not be able to get any of it back.<br />While over written at times in terms of dialogue and scene narration, this debut novel overall is extremely enjoyable. The main character, Josh Michaels, is complex and believable as is the supporting cast. This novel moves forward at a steady pace, despite the large number of pov shifts through the novel, which actually work well to bring deeper depth to the characters. Full of twists and turns, this novel is an intriguing look at one man's journey to the edge of the abyss where all hope is lost before being pulled back from the edge.ble to get any of it back.<br />While over written at times in terms of dialogue and scene narration, this debut novel overall is extremely enjoyable.

That is certainly true in this engrossing second novel from author Robert E. Armstrong. Once again, he relies on his vast experience to bring back Houston Veterinarian Dr. Duncan MacDonell. It's very nice for this reader to have him back as he is quickly becoming a good friend.<br />As head of the Bureau of Animal Regulation and Care in Houston, Texas, Dr. MacDonell is still in charge after the events depicted in the first book, \\"Canis.\\" While there has been a shakeup and his new boss who wants nothing to do with the department feels safer staying as far away as possible, Dr. Armstrong and his office are still burdened with the modern day problems of a shortage of qualified and competent staff, financial woes, and unwanted pets. Add to that, a simple lack of appreciation for his necessary job and Dr. Macdonald is just a bit fed up and then his problems suddenly get massively worse.<br />Dr. MacDonell is in the parking lot of the posh Kingswood Country Club one summer evening waiting for his wife as attendees of a $500 a plate political fundraiser dinner begin to leave. Various dignitaries and others leave with their groups and police escorts quietly into the early summer night until someone starts screaming that the Governor needs a doctor. The Governor, Pat Sawyer, is the former Governor of New Jersey who is just days away from in all likelihood accepting his party's nomination for President in Dallas during the convention. In the meantime, he has been viscously mauled by something and is loosing blood rapidly.<br />MacDonell treats him as best as he can while Sawyer explains that he needed some time alone and had just sat down in his car when he was attacked. He thinks it was a Bobcat or something but is so traumatized by the viscous attack he isn't sure. Dr. MacDonell soon manages to control his bleeding and then is moved out of the way when the Paramedics arrive. MacDonell checks the car and sees a viscous animal acting berserk. But it isn't a Bobcat but instead a housecat which might have rabies.<br />While initial tests on the cat come up negative and Governor Sawyer seems to recover, his health soon begins to take a nosedive. As soon as Governor Sawyer becomes deathly and terminally ill with no hope of recovery, Dr. MacDonell becomes the murder suspect in the eyes of various law enforcement types. Either he was grossly incompetent and didn't handle things correctly or he was totally involved and orchestrating events in the eyes of law enforcement and CDC staff investigating the case. While seeking to clear his good name and keep his office intact under a mounting political firestorm, Dr. MacDonell begins to work the case. He begins to suspect that a deep and abiding personal hatred by someone closest to Sawyer just might have been the motivation to kill. That person is still motivated and as so many others have found out over the years, the cover-up is always messier than the original crime itself.<br />This is another excellent book in this new series and another pleasurable read. In this author's novels, when people die, they die in unusual and interesting ways and this novel repeats that pattern. The author neatly brings the reader into his world and while informing the reader on various issues, manages to deftly mix in a story with a complex mystery. In so doing, the author demonstrates his ability to follow the old rule about writing what he knows while at the same time, making a very good book. Like his first book \\"Canis,\\" this is another non-stop murder mystery full of action, complicated characters and nifty plotting, which results in another fine page turning read.cous animal acting berserk.

Author Robert Armstrong has done exactly that in this well-done mystery featuring Veterinarian Duncan MacDonell.<br />As head of the Bureau of Animal Regulation and Care in Houston, Texas, Dr. MacDonell is all too familiar with the problems presented by pet overpopulation. These problems are compounded by thoughtless owners and petty bureaucrats more concerned with image than safety. Already overburdened with a shortage of qualified and competent staff, financial woes, and unwanted pets, Dr. MacDonell has another problem that once it gets out, will cause media problems. Something of animalistic origin, possibly some sort of hybrid super dog, is killing Houston's homeless population.<br />If it was human, it would be a serial killer and generate a task force. But it isn't, and it is left primarily to Dr. MacDonell to identify the animal and find a way to stop it before it kills again. But the animal has apparent help so Dr. MacDonell is not only faced with finding the animal but also its owner. Despite all the good he has done, bad P. R. begins to pile up and Dr. MacDonell is running out of time to stop the animal before it kills again.<br />Fast paced and never preachy, this engrossing novel points out many of the problems and the few rewards for people who work professionally with animals. At the same time, the primary focus is on the mystery, which is interesting, very detailed, with several false trails and clues, but ultimately and fully resolved. This is a well-written book full of interesting and very human characters and Dr. MacDonell is a refreshing character all himself.<br />This is the first book I am aware of to feature a Veterinarian as the main character and it was a refreshing read in the mystery genre. It is my understanding that this is the first book of several and if the rest of the series maintains this level of quality should provide many hours of enjoyable reading.<br />Canis<br />By Dr. Robert E.

Billed as one in the \\"Kevin Kerney\\" series, this novel is really more about his estranged son Deputy Sheriff Clayton Istee. While it could be read as a stand alone novel, potential readers would be wise to go back to the beginning and work their way forward to this one. I am deliberately ignoring the back-story involving Clayton and Kevin, as well as numerous other issues which continue in this novel, so as not to run the series for new readers.<br />As this novel opens, a fire is burning in the predawn light of Lincoln County, New Mexico. Deputy Sheriff Clayton Istee watches the fire fade out from the efforts of the volunteer firefighters and is there for the discovery of one and then a second body. Both bodies are found in the cellar rubble of an abandoned fruit stand by the side of the highway and at what is left of one body makes it clear that the body has been there for a very long time. Clayton Istee left the Mescalero Tribal Police and joined the Sheriff's Department three months ago and Sheriff Hewitt wants Clayton to work the case, his first major case in the Sheriff's Department<br />Before long, it is determined that one of the bodies is female and she is identified as Anna Marie Montoya who has been missing for over ten years. As Clayton investigates, he has no choice but to deal with his father, Kevin Kerney, now Chief of Police for Santa Fe, New Mexico. Kerney was the lead investigator for the case ten years ago and was never able to find her or find a lead despite extensive investigation. She vanished without a trace until now. With the identification of the second body, links to the past and present begin to connect leading Clayton and Kerney towards a possible reconciliation as well as towards a showdown with corrupt politicians and criminal enterprises that stretch across state boundaries.<br />As in his other novels, this novel is told from the omnipresent narrator viewpoint, shifting back and forth constantly between the various characters.  The characters of Clayton Istee and Kevin Kerney are further developed, but at considerable distance. A lack of emotion even in scenes depicting complex emotion as well as a stiffness in the writing remains for this reader regarding the author, but as the novels begin to stack up, one that is becoming more and more acceptable. Every author has his or her own unique style or idiosyncrasy to the writing and this apparently is Michael McGarrity's own style.<br />While somewhat lacking in the emotionality department, the author has a real talent for bring the culture and landscape of Southwestern New Mexico alive for the reader. Like others in this series, he has once again created a complex twisting mystery full of intrigue and deceit that keeps the reader turning the page and well worth your time.characters of Clayton Istee and Kevin Kerney are further developed, but at considerable distance.

The fact that these concepts have been done before does not diminish the enjoyment of this light mystery by Marilyn Meredith. This novel is an installment of the series featuring Deputy Tempe Crabtree and the people of Bear Creek, California that began with the novel \\"Deadly Omen.\\" This is my first experience with this author and for the most part, I enjoyed the work.<br />As the novel opens, Deputy Crabtree is forced to arrest Nick Two John after she witnesses him slashing the tires of a logging truck during a protest. Nick Two John thinks that as a fellow Native American, Deputy Crabtree should understand what the loggers represent and not arrest him. Instead, she arrests him and takes him to the station despite his begging for freedom every mile of the way. As they get closer to the station, his begging turns into promises of secret information if she grants him his freedom. She does not accept his offer and he does not like it.<br />\\"He climbed out slowly. She took hold of his arm and guided him toward the stairs that led to the back door of the plain, boxy building. His face sullen, his black eyes flashed with anger. \\"' You're going to remember that I gave you the opportunity to prevent what's about to happen in Bear Creek. You're going to be real, real sorry you didn't listen.'\\"<br />His comment seems to ring true as in a matter of hours during a dinner with her Minister boyfriend, Hutch, the owner of the Bear Creek Inn, Andre Donato collapses and dies in the kitchen. It at first looks like death by natural causes, but then another worker at the Inn falls gravely ill with the same symptoms and is rushed to the hospital. She is saved and recovers as an investigation begins. It quickly becomes clear that both victims ingested poison, which makes Andre's death a murder.<br />While the clues seem to pint to Nick Two John, Deputy Crabtree believes that he is innocent for a variety of reasons. She quickly determines that the suspect list is very long and that a number of people had reason to kill him. Pushed to the periphery of the investigation by the detectives on the case that discount her theories, Deputy Crabtree investigates on her own. Rarely does she rely on her position and instead uses various subterfuges to question people who had their own reasons to kill him. Soon, she finds herself a target of a killer, but she does not know which of her suspects is the killer.<br />While overall fairly enjoyable, this is a light read. The characters are for the most part, stereotypical with limited development, even in the case of the major character, Deputy Crabtree. She is of mixed heritage and partly Native American and has very little knowledge of her ancestry. The reader is told repeatedly that she has guilt over her lack of knowledge, but the character does not seem to show such internal emotional conflict except for a couple of very minor instances. Instead, the character recites pat answers and does nothing to rectify her knowledge base.<br />What is more annoying for the reader is the author's reliance on artificial drama at the end of most chapters. She has fallen into the advice trap advocated in many writing magazines today of manufacturing danger or excitement at the end of the chapter to theoretically push the short attention span reader into turning the page and continuing to read. When done occasionally, the technique may work and have some use. However, in this case, with so many chapters ending the same \\"Oh my god!\\" way, the reader is left waiting for the swelling mood music and commercial teases.<br />Having said that, this novel overall is above average and enjoyable. It is a light mystery and a fast read at 140 pages, but has several twists and turns to keep the reader engaged beyond the chapter endings. While it is a short work, it still has more reading enjoyment packed into it than many of the current bestsellers that are triple or more its length.triple or more its length.	2003-09-06

The Secret Service classifies serious threats of assassination in two ways. They are separated into those assassins that want to commit the assassination and get away as compared to those that want to commit the assassination and are perfectly willing to die for it in the process. In either case, the Secret Service knows that if the assassin really wants to do it, then they can't be realistically stopped. M. E. Froelich knows this and she also knows that the Secret Service has never lost a Vice President. As team leader, guarding the newly elected Vice President Armstrong, she does not want to be the first. She has a plan and her boss has given the unprecedented okay to bring in outsiders.<br />\\"'I want to hire you for something,\\" she said. \\"On a kind of posthumous recommendation from Joe. Because of what he used to say about you. He<br />talked about you, from time to time.\\"<br />Reacher nodded. \\"Hire me for what?\\"<br />Froelich paused again and came up with a tentative smile.<br />\\"I've rehearsed this line,\\" she said. \\"Couple of times.\\"<br />\\"So let me hear it.\\"<br />\\"I want you to assassinate the Vice President of the United States.'\\"<br />Actually, what she really wants is for him to use his military training and other skills and tell her if he could successfully get to Armstrong. By using the memory of his dead brother (who she worked with and was a lover) who at least on level was trying to emulate him as well as the fact that Reacher finds the exercise interesting, she gets him to agree to the attempt with specific goals and recommendations in mind for improvement. Reacher brings in Neagle with whom he has worked with before (see other novels in this series) and together they identify some manageable weaknesses in the plan.<br />Reacher explains the problems to the Froelich and then pushes her for the real reason he was brought in as the Service would never bring in outsiders unless they were very concerned. As it turns out, there is a credible threat against Armstrong's life. It is serious and seems to be coming from either a current or former agent of the Secret Service. Since almost everyone is under suspicion, Reacher and Neagle are asked to identify the threat and stop him or her while Froelich continues to coordinate her team's protection of the Vice President. Reacher and Neagle begin to chase the assassins across country and back again while Armstrong's life hangs in the balance until a fateful showdown in the snow in Wyoming.<br />As a parent of school age children, there are not that many books anymore that keep me up past midnight reading. Quite frankly, there aren't that many that can keep me up past ten anymore for that matter. However, this one did it and was thriller in every sense of the word. While it does not plow any new ground really in the Jack Reacher character development, we learn a few new things that reinforce the way he is while at the same time, having a heck of good twisting story to read. This novel has plenty of action and the last 50 pages are very good as Reacher takes care of business his way.<br />This novel is the sixth in the series featuring Jack Reacher.

Some times more than other times and in the last several novels she seemed to finally be just a bit less annoyingly neurotic. Unfortunately, for most of this book, Anna is neurotic and stuck in the past in more ways than one.<br />As the book opens, Anna is temporarily supervising Fort Jefferson, on Garden Key in Dry Tortugas National Park off of Key West. The last supervisor of the park seems to have had a mental breakdown and is off on the mainland getting treatment after seeing ghosts and whatnot flitting around the fort.  Anna has gone about as far as she can go in the Park Service to escape her own demons that haunt her by accepting this posting. She has taken the assignment so that she has time to think about a marriage proposal from Paul. Paul is still a minister, now recently divorced, and wants desperately to marry Anna. But he knows that her answer to pressure is to run as far as she can as fast as she can and has vowed to give her the time she needs to think about his offer. While she does love him, she isn't sure she is ready to once again try marriage as has been made abundantly clear several times in earlier books in this series.<br />Those issues remain for Anna and with little else to occupy her mind, she begins to think that she understands why the previous Supervisor went mad.  Supervising a skeleton staff and very few visitors, Anna begins to look for something to occupy her mind instead of thinking about her life. Her sister Molly has sent to Anna to read a large packet of letters that were written to Anna's great grandmother, Peggy, from her sister Raffia who was married to a Captain station at the Fort shortly at the end of the Civil War. That same time saw the arrival of Dr. Samuel Mudd and Samuel Arnold after they were sentenced to prison time for their roles in the Lincoln assassination. Both men denied involvement.<br />Through a series of flashbacks in letter form, Anna begins to read of the heartbreak and struggle went through by Raffia during that time period. While that mystery occupies her mind, a modern day mystery involving mysterious boats at night and the near death of a Park Ranger occupies her waking thoughts.  The stresses along with a series of other problems begin to take their toll on Anna and what is left of the skeleton staff. As she tries to figure out the present problems, the past continues to occupy more and more of her mental thoughts and before long; the veil between fantasy and reality for Anna becomes almost non-existent. Is she losing her mind or is she having help to crack and if so why?<br />Anna is at her most annoyingly neurotic during the first half of this four hundred page slow read which is something considering this is the tenth novel of the series. As she slowly loses her mind thanks to a plot device that is amazingly telegraphed like a neon sign, she sees ghosts and various apparitions. One is reminded of the many times James Lee Burke has used this same technique to great effect by way of his command of language and Nevada Barr does not come close in pulling the same effect.<br />Once she begins to regain her sanity and work the modern day case as well as the puzzle from the past, this novel improves tremendously. It ceases to wallow in the past on so many levels and instead moves forward steadily and with purpose. The story begins to take of with plenty of action and the many plot twists that have hallmarked her earlier work. But, one has to get through the first two hundred pages that are both literally and figuratively a \\"flashback\\" on many levels. It is ultimately worth the effort to read this book, but it is not Nevada Barr at her best. One hopes with several issues resolved apparently at the conclusion of this novel, Nevada Barr might once again bring back the Anna who was so good in her first book, Track of the Cat., Anna begins to read of the heartbreak and struggle went through by Raffia during that time period.

This is a very good novel with plenty of action and complicated characters. The computer stuff was more of a background level and did not overshadow the plot or storyline.

Greedy mega corporations bent on ruling the world and a love for the sea and adventure have long been hallmarks of Clive Cussler's large body of work. Whether his main character has been Dirk Pitt or more recently, Kurt Austin in a series of novels co written with Pail Kemprecos one always expects the same basic formula. The good guys are so very good while surviving multiple near death experiences that would kill any lesser man or woman. The bad guys are incredibly bad and driven by megalomania of a grand scale, which will ultimately play a large role in their complete and total destructive downfall.  The read will be a good one and the good guys will win, saving the world once again. One does not read Clive Cussler for deep plots, complicated characters, or philosophical musings on life. Not to be taken seriously, one reads Cussler for the sheer thrill of adventure and he does not disappoint.<br />A case in point is his most recent release, which opens as so many of the Kurt Austin novels do. A ship sinks taking people down with it and Kurt Austin leader of the NUMA ® Special Assignments Team must try to do everything he can to save them. In this case, Kurt and his friend and colleague Joe Zavala make the rescue using an untried submersible and soon perform another feat of heroic daring do.<br /> In the aftermath, it becomes clear that one of the ships involved in the incident was sabotaged by outside forces. Kurt begins to investigate and before long begins to feel hunted by a shadowy mega corporation led by a maniacal leader bent on taking over the world. To do so he will use genetic manipulation as well as anything else necessary to achieve an incredible power grab that would change the sea forever.<br /> Blending in the relics of the Basques, a German Zeppelin and the culture of various Inuit (commonly referred to incorrectly as Eskimo) tribes, the authors once again create another grand adventure where the bad guys get a fatal dose of their own medicine in the end. While no new ground is plowed in terms of character development there are not any nasty surprises either. Kurt is still loved by all the women of the world, hated and fearfully respected by his enemies, and calm and collected in the snarling face of danger. He easily compares to Stuart Wood's recent signature character of Stone Barrington, but he does not have as much money. Such is the life of a government employee.<br /> The other usual characters make brief appearances. Admiral Sandecker is rarely seen or mentioned at all in this novel, which is a change from previously books in this series. He has little to do until the very end as opposed to the Trouts, who are given plenty to do in a secondary story line, which eventually peters back into the main storyline where they become sideline players.<br /> Additionally, there is certain choppiness to the novel over the course of its more than 400 pages. In the past, the works flowed seamlessly and it was impossible to determine which part one of the authors write. That is not the case here where the sentence structure shifts from chapter to chapter and while one can't tell precisely who wrote what, one does get a sense who might be responsible.<br /> For what it is, this is another very enjoyable book. As in the others of this series, it is not filled with deep characters, or philosophical musings. Instead it is pure action and adventure and serves as a great break from all the serious pretentious literary stuff. In other words, it is fun and by all means, don't take it seriously.he end.

Much like in his novel A Painted House, Grisham is attempting to do more literary style techniques with deeper characters in this novel. Of course, Grisham's long-standing hatred of his previous profession leaks through again along with the usual thinly disguised rants against the excesses as he sees it of the legal system are included. The combination along with an ending that absolutely settles none of the big issues raised in the book combine for a less that satisfactory read.<br />Ray Atlee is the son of a very powerful and distinguished Judge in Clanton, Mississippi. Ray is a professor at a law school in Virginia and has very little dealings with his father. To have any contact, it would be an effort on both parties and neither one seems to be able to do so. Ray's brother, Forrest, is the resident black sheep of the family and constantly in trouble as well as being in and out of drug and alcohol treatment centers. Both brothers have very little contact as well, but the letter from their father changes that.<br />Judge Atlee has summoned the brothers home to discuss the distribution of his estate. The Judge is dying of various ailments including cancer, and knows his end is near. Unfortunately, he miscalculates and is dead when Ray finds him slumped on the couch. Then he finds something else, a secret that no one besides Ray seems to know about. But, Ray soon learns that at least one other person knows about the secret and will stop at nothing for it.<br />I can't reveal what the secret is without blowing this whole mediocre book. Ray becomes obsessed with the secret and this novel is supposed to chronicle how his life changes due to the knowledge and obsession of the secret. While the reader is supposed to emphasize with Ray's mounting desperation, many of his actions seem to be the result of poor planning and ridiculous to the extreme. At the same time, the inner torment and desperation in the character is never adequately carried to the reader and thus the attempt at character development fails.<br />Furthermore, when I read a 456-page novel, I expect the book to end with an actual conclusion. In this case, apparently I was mistaken. While the ends are tidied up nicely and everything is explained for the reader, the issues aren't solved. If anything, it seems like it was set up precisely this way, not to make some literary point, but to serve as the springboard for a sequel. Such a cheap trick by an author, especially of Grisham's supposed caliber, is extremely annoying and serves no other purpose than to annoy his readers.<br />This novel with its various shortcomings is certainly not the novel of A Painted House and nowhere near the action level of his early work such as The Firm.  Instead, this seems to be more the effort of a novelist who has made his millions and is coasting on his name rather than trying to make any real literary efforts.ttempt at character development fails.<br />Furthermore, when I read a 456-page novel, I expect the book to end with an actual conclusion.

Actually he has several problems and they are all connected to his ownership of Club Fetish. When you own a club that attempts to cater to every sexual fetish and desire, known to man or woman, good help is hard to find. He also does not care for the fact that he is getting squeezed by Vincenzo Carabello, son of reputed mob boss Anthony \\"Nine Lives\\" Carabello. Vinnie is making it harder and harder to run the club and coupled with the fact that Sergio is getting older, he sees his options and his future choices steadily dwindling.<br />Vincenzo has his own problems. His father thinks he is an idiot and won't gracefully move out of the way so that he can run everything. Vincenzo likes the nose candy as well as cross dressing-either one of which could get his father so mad he would have him killed. Vincenzo has plans to make his dreams of glory and power come true and Sergio might just have to be one of the first ones taken care of for Vincenzo to succeed. Sergio knows just a little too much to be left alive.<br />As things begin to build between the two men, numerous additional characters, each with his or her own complex storyline, begin to choose sides as well as line up to settle old scores. Events continue to escalate as greed, deceit, jealousy, and paranoia all play their roles in a dramatic violent confrontation at Club Fetish on New Year's Eve. If the public persona is to be believed, this is not Dick Clark's kind of party, but it is rocking.<br />Full of complex, eccentric characters, this novel is a pleasure to read. Multiple storylines are weaved together steadily throughout the book along with plenty of action and other events to keep the reader turning the page. There are a couple of graphic scenes but everything depicted is used to move the story forward and is mild in nature.  Last, but certainly not least, this book is flat out funny in several parts and certainly would appeal to those who have a slightly twisted sense of humor. This is a great read and well worth the effort.f humor. This is a great read and well worth the effort.	2003-08-18

The author returns again in his fourth book to his military experiences. Much like the other three, this novel features constant action, intriguing and complicated characters and a mystery full of twists and turns to the very last page.<br />As the novel opens, Major Burton Webber is no longer a member of the Air Force and is content to help his Korean wife run her jewelry store. At one time he was Chief of the Osan Air Base (South Korea) office of Special Investigations. But office politics runs everything, especially the military, and he was wrongfully passed over for promotion. Now the Air Force wants him back ostensibly because he is the best at what he does.<br />The Air Force has a politically sensitive problem in a region that now wants Americans to pull out of their bases and go home. An Amerasian bar girl (prostitute) has been brutally murdered and it may have been at the hands of an American service person. If true, it comes on the heels of other recent events in the region and could be the final push for the Americans to go home. Supposedly, General Muller (responsible for the pass over in promotion) wants Webber to come in and investigate the case and find the guilty party and wrap everything up as fast as possible.<br />While Webber does not buy into the situation as described, it is a chance for him to do what he really likes to do and so he agrees. Webber begins to run the investigation and isn't surprised when the investigation begins to run into political roadblocks. As everyone around him seems to lie to him, he continues to work the case and begins to find the clues that will lead him to the killers. His problem is that as his suspect list shortens, the clues seem to be leading him toward those closest to him.<br />As in his other books, Patrick Davis once again writes another tightly plotted mystery. The action flows steadily throughout the novel and the reader is constantly misdirected as the investigation proceeds forward. His characters are complex and human and he shows a real talent for bringing the reader into his world. Simply put: another great read.the reader is constantly misdirected as the investigation proceeds forward.

Both were well written featuring interesting characters and plenty of action along with a complex mystery and plot. Andy McNab is a former Commando in the British SAS so he brings an incredible authenticity to the work. When he describes a gun working a certain way or other key details, you know he did not research it off the Internet or found it in some book; he lived it. But, his last book Firewall was a disappointment especially when compared to the first two. Unfortunately, that trend continues in this recent effort.<br /> As this novel opens, Nick Stone has put himself unknowingly into harms way once again. Desperate for money for himself as well as for treating Kelly (his orphan whose entire family was massacred because of his mistake) he has accepted a contract assassination job from The Firm. The target will appear outside the Houses of Parliament in London, England in what seems to be an officially sanctioned hit at the highest levels of the United States and Britains governments. Unbeknownst to him, the assassination is one very small part of a much bigger picture that will turn into a trap.<br /> Nick is seconds away from the kill shot when he aborts the attempt for a variety of reasons. Police swarm the area and while he escapes the initial gun battle with police he soon comes under their custody before being transferred to his very unhappy employers. They make their feelings physically known to him before giving him one more chance. The target will be in Panama for the next week. Nick is to go to Panama, surveil the target and complete the assassination, this time without fail. The target must be dead by the last light on Friday evening or they will kill Kelly.<br /> Soon Nick is in Panama and what should have been an action oriented read (despite the nonsense on the back jacket) takes a hard turn into the boredom zone. Along with Columbian guerrillas, United States Government interests, Chinese business interests, politics and the environmental movement become major characters in the work. The action slows to a near halt in the muddy jungles of Panama around the Canal Zone as various characters discuss politics and environmental policy with Nick. Unfortunately, the politics and environmental policy situation are old news for any reader who remotely pays attention to world events and as such, raises the boredom factor substantially. The arguments go on for page after mind numbing page and even after all the discussion and lectures, no solutions are offered to at least to attempt to make the preceding pages have some merit on any level.<br /> That fact along with the fact that the ending is amazingly vague and open ended to create the need for a sequel for all the characters, major and minor, makes this novel the absolute worst of the series to date. While the first two books were good and the third mediocre at best, the fall in this one is amazing. It comes across as the literary equivalent of base-jumping without a parachute. Hopefully, this is as bad as it gets, but Andy McNab is running out of time to save the series from himself.es a hard turn into the boredom zone.

Primarily told in series of extended flashbacks, the novel revolves around Melora (Lori to one and all) Wyatt. Lori is dealing with a common issue today, taking care of aging parents.<br />When her father died, Lori came home temporarily to help her mother, Charlotte. But Charlotte is very used to having her opinionated way about all matters and the temporary soon became permanent. The years have passed and for Lori she still is struggling to accept the love she gave up and the career she had planned to come home. The strain and loneliness of her life is beginning to get to her no matter how hard she tries to stay positive.<br />She begins to think that she has found happiness in the form of Blake Johnson. They knew each other years ago in school and while the outcome of that relationship wasn't necessarily positive, he has always had a strange effect on her. That effect is more pronounced now, as he is an adult with bigger dreams and better skills at manipulating the people around him. Slowly, seductively he begins to wear down her defenses and begins to a plan to take everything he wants as well as to recreate a murder scene from fifteen years ago.<br />This novel is full of interesting characters and vivid descriptions of small town life in the foothills of Colorado. This literary style novel relies on character development to move the action forward and does a wonderful job of enticing the reader into this world. A world that may appear sunny and bright on the surface, a Norman Rockwell stylized version of small town life, but at the same time holds numerous dark secrets beneath the surface. At 241 pages, this is a very enjoyable novel and hopefully not the last from this author or her characters.	2003-08-15

In this recent installment of the long running series, her life is the same mess it always is. Her love live is still complicated and confusing as she is torn between Ranger and Morelli. But Morelli wants marriage and for her to settle down and quit the business and she isn't about to do that so that relationship is on the backburner. Ranger has yet to collect on his debt from the last book (Seven Up) and while she does want him to collect she is afraid of what the experience has in store for her when he does.<br />Professionally, she is still working for her cousin Vinnie and apprehending failure to appears so that he does not have to pay off on the bonds. But, the bond business has added a new wrinkle-child custody bonds. She hasn't heard of them before and as the book opens, finds out about their existence from Mabel, the grandmother that owns the other half of the duplex where Stephanie's parents live. Mabel put up her house to guarantee the bond of her daughter, Evelyn. Evelyn and her ex husband, Steven Soder, have a daughter named Annie. Now Annie and Evelyn have disappeared and the shady Steven wants the money guaranteed by the bond so that he can ostensibly look for his daughter.<br />True Blue Bonds Bail Agency is going after the house and Mabel is beside herself with grief and worry about her family as well as the prospects of losing her house. While Stephanie wants to stay out of it, Grandma Mazur is insisting that she help. Stephanie agrees and with the deadline fast approaching to find her or lose the house, she begins the search.<br />She begins looking and while she does not find them, she soon discovers that somehow the psychotic Eddie Abruzzi is involved. While the connection isn't clear, the wreckage left in his wake is and he has declared her part of the enemy as he wages war to find Evelyn and her daughter Anne. At the same time she is working this case for free, she is supposed to deal with the problem of the violent drunk Andy Bender again as well as several other cases. But those pale in comparison as the psychotic Eddie Abruzzi steps up the pressure on her as she experiences his personal obsession.<br />Number eight in the series sheds no new light on Stephanie or her character. She is still fumbling around, making the same mistakes that she made in book one with outrageous consequences. On one hand it is comfortable reading because there are no new surprises and the characters for the most part all act the same. There is nothing new here and certainly nothing to rattle the comfort level of the reader by suddenly killing off a favorite character or something as so many authors are want to do.<br />On the other hand, much of this has been done before and one expects most folks to learn something from their past. For example, when one knows a psycho is stalking, it is best to have bullets in the gun beforehand no matter how much one does not like guns. Does she? Of course not. With psychos and henchmen constantly after her as well as blowing up her latest car (she has always had a hard time with cars) she walks around without her gun.<br />If this was a person in real life, it would drive one nuts. Chronically stupid is not an endearing quality and it would be nice if Stephanie would be a little less neurotic and a little smarter after all this time.of the violent drunk Andy Bender again as well as several other cases.

It begins with a pounding headache, joint pain, and a runny nose. The typical summer cold in appearance and it is highly contagious. For some, the symptoms escalate rapidly and within hours they are dead. For others, the agony goes on as the coughing slowly worsens and the vomiting begins. The lungs begin to shred and the victims begin to drown in their own bodily fluids.<br />Instead of a summer cold, a bioweapon has been unleashed into Florida and Russia by a doomsday cult in Japan. When their cult leader is sentenced to death for the 1995 Sarin gas attack the cult pronounces sentence on the world. The virus, a modified version of the 1918 Spanish Flu that killed millions is released. The cult commits ritualistic suicide condemning humanity to its fate.<br />As civilized society begins to crack at the seams, the President summons Beck Casey, now a professor from his self imposed exile. During his work with the CIA, Beck wrote the book on biological warfare and its implications on society. Beck has bad memories from his CIA work and for justifiable reasons is less than thrilled to be dealing with the CIA, let alone having to go back to Russia. Regardless of his feelings, his mission is to find a vaccine, a serum, anything left behind by the cultists that might save humanity from its fate.<br />This book is very well written and as enjoyable as any fictionalized novel on the subject could possible be. Before the terror attacks of nearly two years ago, I looked at such books as nothing more than escapist literature much like killer asteroids from space, rogue comets, and the like. Doomsday scenarios that I wasn't likely to ever see or worry about. Just nothing more than a fun read as people tried to survive.<br />Then the attacks happened and the son of my best friend who just happened to be a little late for work that day was still on a ferry as the first plane struck. Others were not so lucky and lives were lost. While I may live half a country away, I haven't forgotten and won't. For me, such books aren't escapist fun reads anymore as they have become all too real.<br />That certainly is not intended, or to be taken as, a criticism of the author or his book. The story is well written with numerous subplots and multiple characters. The novel is very well paced and incredibly realistic.

The nightmares had faded as well though he still mourned his deceased pregnant wife Helene. Her death at the hands of terrorists occurred five years ago and was the impetus for his leaving Consular Operations, a covert spy unit within the State Department.<br />The five years have been financially rewarding, as Janson is now a corporate security consultant. The company is his and his reputation allows him to be very selective about his clients. His calm and very orderly life is shattered when, while sitting in a VIP lounge at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, he hears an old operational alias of his being paged. What initially appears to be coincidence quickly turns into an urgent plea for help from Marta Lange on behalf of Peter Novak.<br />Peter Novak is a Billionaire and philanthropist who oversees the Liberty Foundation. Winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Novak is a visionary who has achieved peaceful settlements in some of the most war torn places in the world. While brokering a peace agreement, he was kidnapped by Kanga rebels led by the world-renowned terrorist known as Caliph. They have announced that Novak is to be executed for various crimes within days.<br />Not only does Janson owe his life to Novak because of a past situation, the very group responsible for killing Helene in a terrorist bomb attack has grabbed Novak. A debt of honor must be paid and Janson quickly assembles a team consisting of some of the most skilled operatives he has worked with in the past. For various stated political reasons, the United States government won't help and it is up to Janson, his four-member team and the resources of the Liberty Foundation to rescue Novak.  But things begin to go very wrong from the start of the operation and Janson, feeling his age as well as his old skills returning, becomes aware that he is being used by forces unknown for unknown purposes. Compromised and suspected by his agents of his own government he thought were friends and allies, Janson finds himself soon on another rescue mission. In this case to save his own life and clear his name.<br />It is extremely difficult to criticize a novel by a novelist now deceased. This novel has all the usual Ludlum elements in that it features complex storylines, plots within plots, rogue elements of the United States government, honor and debts to be repaid as well as a globe trotting spy cast adrift. But it misses the human touch that made some of his work so incredibly good.<br />Paul Janson is a complex character full of deep emotion and pain according to the novel. And while that idea is constantly reinforced throughout the work, the novel never makes the visceral connection with the reader. There is an emotional detachment to the work, which is difficult to describe, that distances the novel from the reader and renders the repeated emotional references meaningless.<br />Despite the usual Ludlum elements as noted above, this lack of human connection in the work makes this an average read at best and disappointing at worst.

Vinnie is making it harder and harder to run the club and coupled with the fact that Sergio is getting older, he sees his options and his future choices steadily dwindling.<br />Vincenzo has his own problems. His father thinks he is an idiot and won't gracefully move out of the way so that he can run everything. Vincenzo likes the nose candy as well as cross dressing-either one of which could get his father so mad he would have him killed. Vincenzo has plans to make his dreams of glory and power come true and Sergio might just have to be one of the first ones taken care of for Vincenzo to succeed. Sergio knows just a little too much to be left alive.<br />As things begin to build between the two men, numerous additional characters, each with his or her own complex storyline, begin to choose sides as well as line up to settle old scores. Events continue to escalate as greed, deceit, jealousy, and paranoia all play their roles in a dramatic violent confrontation at Club Fetish on New Year's Eve. If the public persona is to be believed, this is not Dick Clark's kind of party, but it is rocking.<br />Full of complex, eccentric characters, this novel is a pleasure to read. Multiple storylines are weaved together steadily throughout the book along with plenty of action and other events to keep the reader turning the page. There are a couple of graphic scenes but everything depicted is used to move the story forward and is mild in nature.  Last, but certainly not least, this book is flat out funny in several parts and certainly would appeal to those who have a slightly twisted sense of humor. This is a great read and well worth the effort.	2003-08-06

Sometimes the author can, and on rare occasion, exceed the first book. Joel Goldman certainly has managed to do so in this new sequel to his very enjoyable first book, Motion To Kill. As always, I recommend that any interested readers read the first book, which is mentioned occasionally in this sequel. Kansas City trial lawyer Lou Mason as well as most of the other characters are back in this novel. This time Lou Mason has to defend his friend, mentor and landlord, Wilson \\"Blues\\" Bluestone who has been accused of murdering Jack Cullan.<br />Jack Cullan was the mayor's lawyer as well as the political fixer for the powers that be as well as anyone else with enough need and money in Kansas City. Rumor had it that he had files on everyone in town and could have taught J. Edgar Hoover a thing or two in that area. When Cullan is found dead after a violent conformation with Blues in the bar Blues' owns, suspicion naturally falls on Blues.<br />But suspicion had lots of help and Blue and Lou realize a complex frame is underway. Not only does Lou have to fight Blues' case in court, he also has to stay alive on the wintry streets of Kansas City as various forces, for their own clashing reasons, seek to stop him one way or the other.<br />Once again, Joel Goldman weaves an interesting complex tale of intrigue, deceit and murder with the occasional dry humorous comment about the world and the legal profession. Unlike John Grisham, Joel Goldmoon, does not ever mount the soap box to lecture the reader on the evils of the legal profession and does not allow the occasional side comment to interfere with the flow of a good story. Tight writing, plenty of action and a very good twisting mystery puzzle make this another great book of his to read. With two done and two more featuring Lou Mason on the way, he soon should supplant Grisham at his own game and does it by writing a simply better book.	2003-08-05

James Swain has done it again in that he has created another every enjoyable work as well as tying up several loose ends from the first novel. To appreciate this one, you simply have to read the first two so that you get a sense of the story arc that moves throughout all three novels.<br />Using a secondary theme from the previous novel \\"Funny Money\\" to great effect, James Swain brings Tony Valentine back. He also brings back his son Gerry, the neighbor Mabel and others while adding a host of eccentric characters that would make Elmore Leonard proud. Once again he relies on his heavy knowledge of gambling and card manipulation to tell another intriguing story with plenty of action and depth.<br />Harry Smooth Stone, head of security for the Micanopy Indian Reservation has a major problem. One of his dealers, Jack Lightfoot, dealt a player 84 winning hands at a Blackjack table. The player was Nigel Moon and the only possible way it could have happened was if the dealer, Jack Lightfoot, was in on it. Sooth Stone wants Valentine not to figure out why the dealer is suddenly missing but how he did it.<br />Valentine begins to work the case and soon figures out that the actions of Jack Lightfoot are the proverbial tip of the iceberg. Valentine follows an increasing violent and convoluted trail to Rico Blanco who once worked for Crime boss John Gotti involved, as well a numerous other characters who are also working their own illegal deals. With millions in an ongoing scam and college basketball at stake, Valentine is soon marked for death as more as more things go wrong and the bad guys start dying.<br />This third novel in the series continues to flesh out the Tony Valentine character as well as further explore the complicated backgrounds of others in his life. It features the tight writing, plotting, occasional humor and eccentric characters found in his first two novels but in considerably more abundance. Much like Robert Ludlum did with his wheels within wheels espionage novels, James Swain novels feature cons within cons at so many levels it becomes a very enjoyable reading experience.c characters found in his first two novels but in considerably more abundance.

It is bad enough not to like your job when you work for a prestigious law firm in Kansas City, Missouri. It gets a little worse when your boss asks you to dispose of documents that would harm the case you both are working on and could damage the firm.  Things get even worse when your boss is found dead and floating in the lake and you have no real alibi. But things can get even worse as detailed in this enjoyable novel.<br />As the novel opens, Lou Mason has one heck of a headache thanks to drinking the night before to excess.  He has spent the night outside, on a deck chair at the retreat for his law firm. He feels guilty over the case that he lost and plans to quit as soon as possible.  He works for Sullivan &amp; Christian, a Kansas City law firm that  \\"... employed forty lawyers to merge and acquire client's assets so they could protect them from taxation before and after death.\\" Their biggest client is a powerful banker by the name of Victor O'Malley. The U. S. Attorney, Franklin St. John, believes that he is dirty and has been building a case against him and now has invited O'Malley to appear before the grand jury. It does appear that O'Malley is guilty of something and Sullivan had asked Mason to lose certain incriminating documents.  Mason refused and now has been asked to identify a body that or may not be Sullivan's by the beautiful Sheriff Kelly Holt.<br />It does not help that the Sheriff has discovered a memo from Sullivan stating that Mason asked Sullivan to destroy the documents, that he refused, and that Sullivan was going to fire him Monday morning.  It also does not help that Mason has other reasons not to tell the Sheriff everything, both for himself and the firm. They have enough problems without that, but soon Mason realizes after several incidents, that someone believes he knows more than he does. As he dodges attempts on his life, the body count grows and he feels the pressure from all sides.<br />While this novel is very enjoyable, I would not refer to it as a \\"legal thriller\\" as it is marketed. Nothing in this 380-page novel takes place in a courtroom and little takes place at the law firm. Instead, with limited character development, this novel as in most action and adventure novels relies on physical confrontation and death to move the story and plot forward. Readers expecting a courtroom style case where the killer cracks on the stand would be disappointed. However, ignoring how the novel is marketed, this is a very good action novel, which uses the law as a thematic backdrop for a complex mystery. In that respect, this work is highly entertaining and a worthwhile read.not refer to it as a \\"legal thriller\\" as it is marketed.

However, just because they have been done before is no reason to miss the second installment of the Tony Valentine series. If you haven't read the first book, \\"Grift Sense\\" then please skip this review for now and then come back after you have read that book which was also reviewed here. The reads are well worth it.<br />It has been more than a couple of months since the last book. Business is going well and then one evening, Valentine gets a call from his old friend and former partner, Doyle Flanagan. Doyle has retired and is working as a Private Investigator in Atlantic City. Doyle is currently working a case for The Bombay Casino trying to catch a player who managed to steal $6 million while playing Blackjack. Minutes later, just as he began telling Valentine about the case, he is killed by a car bomb.<br />Valentine goes to Atlantic City for the funeral and then the hunt. Soon, he find that he can't keep up with the numerous scams and cons going on, many of which involve at least some of the employees if not the Casino owner himself. As he gets further and further behind, chasing the killers, he manages to antagonize everyone around him and becomes a thorn for all concerned leaving bodies in his wake.<br />As in the first book, this is another tightly plotted, complex mystery where no one and nothing is at it seems. Most of the individuals from the first book are back and adding a plausible love interest further expands the Valentine character.  At the same time, this is a step up from the first book and shows the author evolving at his craft. The book moves forward at a better pace and with considerably more action while at the same time, he allows the supporting cast of characters to flesh out more as well. Simply put, this series that does not get a lot of attention, is well worth the read.	2003-07-30

No matter how good the storyline or plot setup is, if the characters don't come alive for the reader, then the book won't be that good. In this case, everything works across the board, which creates a very enjoyable debut novel by Brian Rouff.<br />As Dice Angel opens, Jimmy Delaney is on a rather bad roll of luck in life. Not only is his ex-wife Joy (who isn't) giving him a hard time, but burglars have broken into his supper club named Jimmy D's. The club is a legacy from his father who started it from nothing and lately it seems to be a target for every burglar in Las Vegas. This time they got the cash from the video poker machines, which adds up to quite a sum. But that loss seems rather small when he discovers that the IRS wants $50,000 for back taxes and penalties within days and his checks are bouncing all over town.<br />It appears that his ex brother in law who was his accountant and supposed to be handling all sorts of things, instead embezzled every last cent and took off, leaving behind his marriage and his very ill daughter. Jimmy turns to the usual sources as his world slowly collapses seeking funds to pay off the IRS and keep the club open. The quest for help goes nowhere and as he hits rock bottom, he has nowhere else to turn except to the mysterious lady known as Dice Angel. Supposedly through the means of mystical powers she can bring lady luck back into Jimmy's life so that he can save himself and those he cares so much about.<br />Beyond the storyline that suffers greatly in my telling, is the fact that this novel is full of interesting characters that actually come alive for the reader. Within a few pages the author pulls the reader into the Vegas he knows so well and the pull is simply irresistible. It is also fascinating to watch Jimmy D crash and resurrect himself and evolve as a character over the course of this 222-page novel. This fast read is over way too soon and hopefully there will be another following Jimmy D., his club, and his somewhat eccentric customers and staff.be another following Jimmy D., his club, and his somewhat eccentric customers and staff.	2003-07-28

He had the ability to create enjoyable techno thriller novels that blended technology with complex characters and interesting story lines. His books seemed to come alive for the reader. Unfortunately, a couple of novels back, that ability seemed to disappear as he insisted editors were meaningless in interview after interview and moved away from technology. His books also seemed to lose their thriller component at the same time and moved into long discourses on political theory and his views of the same. That same trend continues in the recent novel.<br />This novel follows Jack Ryan and a host of other folks around in the early 80's during the uprising in Poland while President Reagan began calling the USSR the Evil Empire. As Shakespeare once asked about another priest, the Russians are not happy with Pope John Paul. Their unhappiness is worsened by his thinly disguised threat that if the Russians do not leave Poland alone, he will resign the papacy and return to Poland to be with his people. The Russians have a solution-kill the Pope. But to do so, they have to use outside personnel and hence the Bulgarians are contacted. The plot is hatched, the good guys in the form of Jack Ryan and all move to stop it as well as launching a plan of their own. They have an idea to bring the USSR down. As they say, the rest is history.<br />And that is precisely one of the two major problems with the book. For many of us who are old enough to remember, we lived through those days and the attack on the Pope. Regardless of church affiliation or religion, the attack was a shock at the time and we know how it ended-or at least, the public version of events. By going back to that time, the burden was on Clancy to provide a new perspective on events as well as making the known history interesting. Unfortunately, he failed.<br />He also once again commits the sin of being fundamentally boring. When he wrote his techno thrillers, he could go on for several pages about how various components of various systems connected and there was some interest for the reader. A few novels ago, he decided to forgo the techno aspect of his novels and apply the same long-winded discourse to inner mental processes of his characters. It simply does not work. At one point, he has one of the many Russians characters mentally ruminate about the history of Marxist-Leninist theology in Russia for over ten mind-numbing pages. The only action by the character is to gaze into the fire and sip his alcoholic beverage of choice while he goes on and on about the subject in his head.<br />As in his other books, because of Clancy's access to sources, one has to wonder how much of the book beyond the public facts is real. That might be precisely why Clancy is writing this kind of book instead of what worked before. In these days where a law enforcement officer can get a person's library records for no other reason than curiosity, Clancy may be concerned that his sources would receive extraordinary attention. After all, he has had some experience in this regard. Setting a book on events twenty years ago may solve that problem.<br />Or it could be, Clancy may simply think that he can write anything and it will sell. Clearly as he has often stated in his arrogance, there is no need for his books to be edited and at 618 pages it comes in smaller than most of his have lately. He may simply believe that the book buying public is a moth to the flame and as long as his name is on it, he will make millions. At the time of this writing, it appears to be true so far. At some point, one would expect the public to understand that the Clancy of old is not the Clancy of now and to stop buying his line or his books.<br />In the meantime, it is my humble opinion as a reader that this book is simply not worth the paper it is printed on.

Tony Valentine is a former cop and something of a legend in gambling circles. Retired to Florida, Valentine now works as a consultant with casino owners who know that they are being cheated by some of the players. Known as \\"Grifters\\" these players have perfected cheating to a science and work the circuit from Las Vegas to Atlantic City and back again using disguises, misdirection and other techniques. For the casinos where profit and staying in business is a razor thin edge one talented grafter can bring a casino down fast.<br />Nick Nicocropolis, owner of the Acropolis Casino &amp; Resort in Las Vegas has been hit hard for several days in a row. The player going by the name of Frank Fontaine played blackjack at Nola Brigg's table and walked away with over one hundred thousand dollars over several days. He vanished and left the ten-year veteran employee, Nora, to take the heat.<br />Nick brings Valentine from Florida to Las Vegas to help catch Fontaine who quite possibly might be planning a bigger score. There are signs that his schemes have a personal edge to them as if he wants to bring down Nick and no one, including Nick, seems to know who he really is or why he would have it in for him. But he does and as Valentine works the case, others involved seem to set their sights on him for one reason or another, which may put those that he cares about in harm's way.<br />This is the first novel of a planned series and was a very enjoyable read. Tony Valentine is a gruff but engaging character that is less than thrilled with some aspects of modern life. He has a deeply sarcastic streak that while a kick to read is often missed by the other characters involved in the book.<br />This novel reminds me of early Sue Grafton novels. It had that same feel to the read with the offbeat storyline and characters, a detective that fumbles around from time to time trying to get a handle on the situation and a complicated story. This read is well worth your time and promises to be the start of a very good series.e start of a very good series.	2003-07-25

Box brings back Wyoming Game Warden Joe Pickett for another adventure in the Wyoming backcountry. As in his first book, this novel has flatness to the writing at times, but the last 100 pages are filled with nerve-racking enjoyment.<br />As the novel opens, a massive explosion rips through the Bighorn Natural Forest just outside of Saddlestring, Wyoming. A fire lookout sees the blast and the resulting plume of smoke and falling debris. He calls the local Sheriff's office to report it and soon Sheriff O. R. \\"Bud\\" Barnum calls Joe. Sheriff Barnum does not have any idea what exploded but believes a number of animals were killed and requires the services of Joe.<br />Joe meets the Sheriff out at the explosion site and for a brief period of time, they are both able to put their mutual animosity towards each other aside. Dead cattle are everywhere as well as downed trees and a blasted crater several feet deep. The sheer enormity of the blast amazes and sickens both men. But soon, human remains are found and the Sheriff asserts his authority over the investigation, as the deaths of people are his domain. He forces Joe to the sidelines of the investigation but word of the victims soon leaks out and appears in the local small town paper.<br />Stewie Woods and his wife were apparently both killed in the explosion. Stewie Woods, who some considered an ardent environmentalist and others considered him to be an ecoterrorist is blamed for the blast. Sheriff Barnum's theory is that Stewie, long known for sabotaging ranchers, miners and everyone and everything around in defense of the environment as he saw it, was attempting to sabotage some of the cattle that were grazing on federal land. Theoretically, he mishandled explosives that he was attaching to the cattle in protest and accidentally killed himself and his new wife. Joe thinks the answer is just too pat and has a personal stake in the situation, which becomes a major portion of the book. He launches his own investigation and soon finds himself in the cross hairs of a sniper's rifle as a killer chases him across the high country of Wyoming.<br />As in Open Season, C. J. Box is best at describing the rugged beauty of the Wyoming landscape. Those scenes come alive and for a moment it seems as if you are on a horse next to Joe as he surveys elk flowing across the spring grass under a stark blue sky with a gentle wind blowing.  Unfortunately, when his characters speak, the illusion is cracked as many of the dialogue sections seem just a bit stilted. One kind of winces at times knowing that most folks do not really speak the way he writes in the scenes he describes.<br />However, his last 100 pages of this novel make you forget the limitations that came before them. Something happens and everything begins to click and run together as the chase winds across the rugged mountains with Joe chased by a determined killer bent on finishing his job to the last man. What follows is some of the best writing I have had the pleasure to read in sometime and ranks up there with some of the best written chase scenes by the masters.

Married to Harold, a lawyer who is approximately twenty years older than her, she has two sons' ages ten and twelve as well as a pair of swans on a pond on the property. Despite his past history of infidelity he has sworn to behave and she is trying to make their marriage work. That is until she receives a call from Damien.<br />Damien is a nightmare from sixteen years ago as she was about to graduate from Berkley. An experienced older man who drew her to him like a moth to flame as a lover at first and then tried to control her through abuse. Eventually she was able to break free of him and worked on herself for several years in therapy before meeting Harold.<br />As Damien begins to reinsert himself into her life by stalking her, Samantha begins to suffer physical and emotional attacks. Harold makes himself unavailable and soon she finds herself turning to her good friend and doctor Paul Boucher. Boucher's wife died two years ago from cancer and has only recently realized that he has deep feelings for Samantha. He soon begins to far exceed the boundaries of the Doctor/Patient relationship in his attempt to help Samantha break free from both Damien and Harold. As Damien continues to stalk her and Harold ignores her, Paul and Samantha are pushed romantically closer and closer together.<br />While there is an interesting storyline, this novel suffers from a lack of believability. From basic things such as the fact that a woman forty years old plus with children older than ten is repeatedly referred to as a \\"young mother\\" to basic factual problems regarding medical procedures, it is hard to maintain a suspension of disbelief necessary to support the book. Then there is the added problem of a lack of reality in the characters themselves. These characters are complete opposites with not a single character being anywhere in the middle. This romantic mystery features characters that are incredibly evil or incredibly good with not a single character having any combination of the two.<br />On some levels this novel does work. It is grammatically well written, holds the reader's interest and does tell an interesting story that is resolved well with all plot points and details covered. Unfortunately the pluses do not outweigh the negatives and one is left with an average read.ic mystery features characters that are incredibly evil or incredibly good with not a single character having any combination of the two.<br />On some levels this novel does work.

Ford has begun an interesting new series featuring the reclusive Frank Corso. First seen in Fury, Frank Corso is back and as dark as ever. Since this novel picks up approximately seven months after events depicted in Fury and refers to those events repeatedly throughout this novel, I would strongly urge prospective readers to read Fury first before reading this novel. It simply isn't possible to review this novel without giving away a few details, which would be better covered in their entirety in Fury. Having said that, I am simplifying greatly the plot and storyline to keep out as much as possible for those unfamiliar with the previous novel.<br />For years, the government has chased the Russian mobster Nicholas Balagula through one trial after another with no success. Balagula sees United States justice as a game-a game where he has always won by jury tampering, violent intimidation and the murder of witnesses. Now, he is on trial once again. This time, he is being tried for the deaths of 63 people who lost their lives in a hospital building collapse. The trail has been moved from California up to Seattle and extraordinary measures are being taken to protect the safety and integrity of the jury and the case.<br />Frank Corso is the only non-participant allowed to attend the murder trial of Balagula.  His well-publicized notoriety and connections gets him unlimited access and he hopes to turn the project into another one of his true crime books. While he wants another success on his hands, he also wants the government to win.  At the same time, with a grandstanding golden boy of the United States Attorney's Office in charge, Warren Klein, he has his doubts whether they can do the job. It looks like his suspicions are correct as from the beginning the trial things begin to go wrong and like most golden boys of one stripe or another, Klein blames everyone else for his mistakes.<br />While his suspicions concerning the case have been initially confirmed, Corso isn't really paying attention. His old flame and very special friend, Meg Dougherty, is in intensive care in the hospital. Apparently in her occupation as a photojournalist, she witnessed something so horrendous that she drove her car under a parked semi in a desperate attempt to get away that nearly resulted in her death. Corso wants to find out what she saw as well as clearing himself from the suspect list as the police seemed convinced that he had some hand in her near death.<br />Frank Corso is an interesting and hard to define character. This novel reveals a little more about his personality and what drives him while at the same time managing to hide a tremendous amount behind his darkly complex personae. As in his other books, a certain sense of darkness and moral decay pervades the work. Full of interesting complex characters, tight writing and multiple themes make this another good read. Once again, he provides a journey where justice is not an absolute black and white stereotype, but shades of gray. G. M.

As this novel opens, it has been just a couple of weeks since the events depicted in the last novel, Stabbing Stephanie. But more important that that or that it is almost Christmas is the fact that it has been a little over two years since the events in Missing Marlene, the first Jane Stuart cozy mystery. Having not heard from her since, Ivy (Marlene's mother) is back for a short time.<br />As this is a series, I am going to be forced to reveal some details but as always will try to limit the damage for those who have not read the earlier books. In Missing Marlene, Ivy and Jane Stuart had a terrible falling out. Ivy and Jane had been roommates in College and still considered themselves best friends these many years later. Though separated and going through many life changes, they still kept in contact. Marlene was Ivy's daughter and soon after arriving in town to be a nanny to Nick, Jane's son, Marlene vanished and was later found dead. Despite the fact that Marlene was responsible for what happened to her by dealing with some unsavory types, Ivy blamed Jane for her death as well as a laundry list of other issues and ended the friendship.<br />Truth be told, Jane was somewhat relieved that the friendship ended as she had slowly come to the realization that Ivy was using their friendship as leverage against Jane for whatever she wanted at the moment. But guilt and a deep sense of wanting people in her life to be happy drives Jane and when Ivy suddenly arrives in town, Jane goes once again against her gut feelings. She allows Ivy to shoulder her way back into her life and her home. Soon she learns that Ivy now lives in New York City, a short distance away and has stared a new job and new career. She also has a new boyfriend in her life, John Baglieri. But, as expected, John is not at all what he says he is and neither is their relationship.<br />Soon after Ivy's arrival, Rhoda Kagan and Adam Forrest visit Jane at her literary agency. Adam is the new owner of Mt. Munsee Lodge located at the top of Mt. Munsee. Adam is trying something different in that he is trying to keep the lodge open during the winter off-season. He is doing it by offering weeklong stays on different themes. But he is in a bind as he has had a sudden cancellation and now has an idea to pitch to Jane. He wants her to organize a sort of writer's retreat for the week between Christmas and New Years using the local writers group and her publishing contacts. While Jane had planned to relax, she soon agrees and with her contacts it does not take long to get things organized.<br />She also agrees because it will give her a break from Ivy who has already obliviously worn out her welcome. But, Ivy insists that she be allowed to come and after Jane agrees, manages to get her boyfriend John invited along as well. Within minutes of arriving at the retreat the couple soon makes their influence felt by all participants. Almost from the start, the conference disintegrates in literary snobbishness and innuendo and before long, Ivy is dead and the conference is disbanded.<br />Jane begins to nose around and discovers that amidst all the authors and publishing types, the usual themes of greed and jealousy have taken their toll with more than one perched on the thin edge of madness. This forth novel in the series is another enjoyable read featuring Jane Stuart and the various expected characters, both human and feline. After four books, these characters are like old friends and with no new real ground plowed here in terms of character development, a few dangling problems and themes are cleared up.<br />As noted in the earlier books, with his personal experience as a novelist, writing teacher and running his own literary agency, Mr. Marshall interweaves a secondary message for those interested in writing as a career. The series is worth reading, if not for anything else, for those literary authors that Jane represents and comes into contact with and how she handles their demands.Those short segments often provide laugh out loud reader reaction and are a key component of the series. This book as the others in the series is a fun, lightweight mystery.Those short segments often provide laugh out loud reader reaction and are a key component of the series.

Fans used to the Jan Burke's Irene Kelly character are going to be in for a rude shock when they pick this book up. Irene Kelly is gone and this book may signal the beginnings of a brand new series character as well as a more intense, graphically disturbing writing style. The results, while at times disturbing, created an intense read that makes this book live up to the billing on the front cover \\"a novel of suspense.\\"<br />This is an exceedingly difficult book to review, as there are three main storylines of equal importance with numerous overlapping plot points. As such, I am forced to simplify greatly while trying to avoid giving away major elements of the plot. The main thing is to understand that this is simply a very good book.<br />As the book opens, Homicide Detective Alex Brandon of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department has been called out to the site of a gruesome murder. Someone has been carefully hung upside down from the ceiling of a bathroom. The individual was repeatedly tortured and then, through the use of an anti-coagulant injection allowed to slowly bleed out through numerous small cuts into the bathtub until dead. He has been dead sometime but he is readily identifiable as Bernado Adrianos, one of the top ten on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. Along with killing him, his killer has also helpfully written the number nine in his blood on the bathroom mirror.<br />The killing reminds Detective Brandon of another case from many years ago involving Kit Logan. At this same time, Kit Logan is at his expensive home in Colorado. The victim of horrific child abuse, which is detailed graphically in the novel, he has tried desperately to put his past aside by isolating himself. But isolation has not turned out to be the answer and once again, his enemies seem to be moving in on him.<br />The third storyline involves Everett Corey who is a manipulative sociopath with twisted ideas fueled by his own past history of child abuse. He seeks revenge and as the third point on the abuse triangle he is going to stop at nothing to manipulate Logan and Detective Brandon to get his way. He has a plan and a machine and intends to get his revenge for perceived slights from many years ago.<br />The three storylines are steadily weaved tighter and tighter as the body count climbs until an incredible climax that covers the last fifty pages of this very enjoyable novel. At times, this book is very disturbing in that the theme of child abuse at various levels touched all three characters (as well as others in the work) and had major impacts on their lives. The child abuse sections are very graphic in description and as a parent I found them to be disturbing. However, these scenes are necessary to the work and not gratuitous as they provide fundamental explanations of character development.<br />As such, this is not an Irene Kelly book. The writing is intense with the characters having multiple levels of depth and complex emotions and motivations. This book lives up to its billing and then some and is well worth the read. From the jacket copy as well as the novel itself, it would not surprise me a bit if this turned out to be the launching pad for a whole new series and if so, Jan Burke has her work cut out for her to beat this one.rd point on the abuse triangle he is going to stop at nothing to manipulate Logan and Detective Brandon to get his way.

Listen, Jett, everything's copacetic over here.\\"<br />Everything's copacetic-a code phrase between friends and warriors that signals danger as it did during the Gulf War. John \\"Jett\\" Gavallan is the CEO and driving force behind his company named Black Jet Securities. Named after the Stealth Bomber he flew during the war, his company stands at the brink of incredible success. He has hedged everything he owns and gambled his company's future on a bid to become an international player in the world of Initial Public Offerings (IPO). In six days, he is supposed to bring Mercury Broadband, Russia's leading internet multi-media company to market on the New York Stock Exchange. The IPO is expected to raise around two billion dollars, with a chunk of that going to Black Jet Securities for fees and services.<br />However, on the Internet, an anonymous webmaster who runs a very well known IPO news website states that Mercury is a sham and that soon Gavallan will be explaining why he defrauded the world from behind bars. He also seems to have digital proof in the form of pictures of Mercury equipment. As some of the big investment houses begin to question the deal, Gavallan sends fellow Gulf War pilot and friend Grafton Byrnes to Russia to check out the situation. While the Swiss financiers that claim to have checked things out assure Gavallan that everything is fine, Gavallan wants to make absolutely sure with everything riding on the deal being legit.<br />Soon, as he is held hostage by Konstantin Kirov, head of Mercury Broadband, Byrnes makes the call that for listeners should have reassured Gavallan. Warned, Gavallan begins to dig and discovers that everything he has believed the last few years has all been a lie. A lie that is poised not only to wipe out his company but could easily cost him his life as the offering will go through-one way or another.<br />This is really a novel of two parts. The first 300 pages is an incredibly slow read as the players are moved into positions and the intricacies of IPO finance are explained. Much as he did in his previous book \\"Numbered Account\\" the author relies heavily on his own financial experience to detail numerous pages of market information, which does little to move the novel or the story forward. In addition, this section also consists of an extraordinary number of long flashback sections including ones that relate to the Gulf War. The resulting back-story is not handled well and further slows the pacing of the entire novel.<br />However, once the tale actually gets going as Gavallan chases around the world via Lears and even a MIG in an effort to save himself and his friend, the novel becomes enjoyable. The problem is that it is a long way to get to the good stuff and the journey is for the most part, mind numbingly boring.<br />That is precisely the problem with this entire novel. The characters are flat, the writing virtually unemotional and distant even in scenes that are supposed to convey intense emotion to the reader and the entire novel moves incredibly slowly. This novel quickly became very hard work to read and should have received some judicious editing.yers are moved into positions and the intricacies of IPO finance are explained.

These characters were first introduced in Missing Marlene, which was followed by Hanging Hannah. As this is the third in the series with a forth novel, Icing Ivy due in November, it isn't possible to review this novel without giving away some background detail. In you have not read the series, I would encourage you to skip this review and instead read the books in order, as you won't be disappointed.<br />As this novel opens, Jane Stuart is exhausted. Her literary agency is still struggling but seems to have turned the corner financially speaking. Because of the events in the two previous novels as well as the simple strain of being a widow with a small child as well as running a business she needs a vacation. The problem is that Thanksgiving is just a few days away and she plans to be gone by then and still has not decided what sun drenched island she is going to. Not only is the cold weather of winter blowing into New Jersey, but so too is cousin by marriage, Stephanie.<br />Stephanie was related to Kenneth, (Jane's deceased husband) so she feels a tremendous obligation when Stephanie calls her. Stephanie is moving to the same village as Jane Stuart, Shady Hills. She is moving from Boston after she lost her job there to join a publishing company that also happens to be moving to Shady Hills at the same time. Carson and Hart happens to be run by a quite famous now college roommate of Stephanie's who has helped her out by hiring her. But she needs a place to stay temporarily while she looks for a place of her own and with much reluctance; Jane finally agrees that she can move in with her.<br />Stephanie arrives and soon has the house in an uproar. Apparently racist, she dislikes Jane's assistant, Daniel as well as Jane's nanny, Florence. While she seems to be able to tolerate, Nick, Jane's ten year old son, she certainly does not like Winky the cat, her accommodations or just about anything else in Jane's world. But, reminding herself frequently that Kenneth would have wanted her to help her, Jane tries to tolerate Stephanie's problems and appalling attitude. After all, it won't be long before she has her place of her own and Jane is going to go on vacation, if she can just pick the spot.<br />But her plans keep getting derailed as strange things begin to happen in her small little town with Stephanie's arrival. Break-ins, a rather rare event in the past seem to surge in numbers and then people start dying. At the same time, Stephanie seems to be having more and more problems at work and desperately begs Jane to go undercover at the publishing company and snoop to see if things are really running right. Jane eventually agrees and discovers that strange things are indeed going on with one heck of a twist.<br />This series is very enjoyable. Clearly Mr. Marshall is drawing on his own experience as head of his own literary agency as well as his own advice to writers.  He cleverly weaves some of that advice again in each one of his novels without coming across as heavy-handed or preaching. At the same time, each novel reveals a little more about the main characters while having plenty of action with numerous twists and false clues. Clearly, no major character is totally safe in this series, which also adds to the enjoyment factor.<br />This is a series that should be definitely started with the first book, Missing Marlene.

It had a forceful,<br />almost desperate quality to it.<br />Henry Pierce told the caller he had the wrong number. But<br />the voice became insistent.<br />\\"'Where is Lilly?'\\"<br />\\"'I don't know,'\\" Pierce said. \\"'I don't know anything about her.'\\"<br />\\"'This is her number. It's on the site.'\\"<br />\\"'No, you have the wrong number. There is no one named Lilly here.<br /> And I don't know anything about any site. Okay?'\\"<br />So opens the very enjoyable and fast paced mystery thriller from Michael Connelly. Instead of being part of the great Harry Bosch series, which began with The Black Echo, Mr. Connelly spins a web of murder and deceit involving Henry Pierce and molecular computing. Personally, I would rather read more about Harry Bosch, but this one is good as well.<br />Henry Pierce is the owner and driving force behind Amedo Technologies. They are in a race to create the first molecular computer-a computer that uses organic molecules instead on silicon chips. If successful, the possibilities are endless and will totally revolutionize medicine, as we know it. The project is named \\"Proteus\\" and seems to be the answer. But like artists of old, these new technology visionaries need a wealth patron to support their efforts. Henry and his team are just days away from presenting their breakthrough to a possible investor as well as patenting their creation.<br />But, while he may be on the brink of financial business success, Henry's personal life is in shambles. His relationship with Nicole is over and seems to be irretrievably broken. And then the strange calls start and keep coming one after another. For inexplicable reasons, that he isn't even sure about, he feels compelled to find Lilly.<br />Obsessing over this mystery woman, he begins to follow the few clues to her he is able to find. The trail leads him into the world of Internet pornography, escort services, and organized crime. Along the way as he digs himself steadily deeper with both the Police and his business partners, he begins to suspect every one around him. He jeopardizes everything he holds dear including his own life, to find Lilly, a woman he has never met and does not know.<br />While the subject matter in this novel is dark at times, it does not have the melancholy feel to it that many of the Harry Bosch novels contain. Like Harry Bosch, Henry Pierce has his dark secrets, which do influence his actions, but he is more aware of their influence than Bosch is of his own. This is a lighter weight novel in style, mood and substance than the novels in the Harry Bosch series but is very good on its own level.<br />While the abyss does not look as dark or deep in this novel, the work still showcases why Mr. Connelly is a great writer. His senses of style, pacing and character development once again work incredibly well together to set the mood and weave this complex tale. With plenty of twists and turns and a real shock in the last forty intense pages, this novel is definitely one not to be missed.the Police and his business partners, he begins to suspect every one around him.

Picking up where \\"Bone Key\\" left off, the project is moving forward and things are going so well, John has opened a satellite office in the area and is occasionally commuting to the home office in Miami. If it weren't for Isabella, his daughter who lives with his estranged wife Janice, he would ditch Miami and move to the Keys.<br />Then the rich Mr. Fuentes arrives in his small non-descript office in Key West. Mr. Fuentes has a proposition for John Deal. The days of Castro are numbered and the rebuilding of Cuba, especially the historical landmarks in Havana, will soon be underway. Mr. Fuentes wants John to follow his deceased father's footsteps back to Cuba and consult on the rebuilding. Mr. Fuentes brushes aside current political concerns and believes that once Castro departs this mortal coil, a tidal wave of money, especially American money, will wash over the island. John Deal would not only get a consulting fee now for making the trip and considering what needs to be done, he would stand to make a fortune once the actual work began underway. This could be the final break he needs to once again bring the construction company his father created, DealCO, all the way back to its preeminent status.<br />John Deal agrees to consider the scope of the work and soon arrives in Havana, Cuba aboard Mr. Fuentes opulent yacht.  Like the crumbling structures that hide the past beauty of the city, the real reason Mr. Fuentes brought him to Cuba lies hidden beneath the surface. Slowly, it becomes apparent as John finds himself the target of gun wielding thugs and the center of a political mess in Cuba and at home. Survival, not money becomes paramount as John Deal struggles to escape the island alive.<br />This is not the normal John Deal series book that I have grown accustomed to reading over the years. Missing is the humor, the occasional witty comment, that served as additional background in the other novels of the series. In fact, the human element is all but lost in this novel that spends so much time in regards to family connections.<br />Instead, the reader is told that one should feel emotion over various things throughout the novel, but that emotional connection to the reader is never made. There is a certain distance to the writing, which is especially surprising considering some of the various personal events in John Deal's past that are covered. Considering the obvious storytelling possibilities, this lack of emotion is amazing and can't be discussed further without giving away major portions of the novel.<br />This book also hardly answers the many questions that it raises. One question is answered at the end, but most are left dangling in what appears to be nothing more than a setup for the next novel of the series.

I don't know why that is because it is one of the categories I gladly review. With a teenager in the house I often find myself trying to find books that are good ones to serve as a counterpoint to what the school system mandates the kids to read. Not that those books are not quality books. But often, they are books that are on very depressing subjects and a steady diet of that is not a good thing. Luckily, this one came along and provided a nice counterbalance as well as to being really very good.<br />This early teen novel tells an interesting tale about three very special kids. Suzanne has the ability to tell the future. Jessie can read minds; something her parents are less than thrilled about. Greg has Psychokinesis, or the ability to move objects with his mind. He has to have the object in complete visual view at all times to be able to move the object.<br />All three have difficulties controlling their special powers and have been brought together by Professor Altman as a result of their families' complaints. Professor Altman studies cases of paranormal psychology at the local university. Professor Altman believes he can teach them how to control their powers. He offers them an opportunity to learn how to turn their powers on and off. To do this, they will learn to work together solving some of the problems that people, including the Police, have brought to Professor Altman.<br />After agreeing to help, various strange events begin to happen. Told in the first person style of narration through Greg, events begin to suggest that he might be losing his mind. Even Greg suspects the worst but his new young friends are convinced that something else is going on. The events continue to build to a surprising conclusion that tests the unique as well as normal abilities of all the kids.<br />This short novel is very good and was an enjoyable pleasure to read. While not suitable for young children due to the subject matter, it will definitely appeal to those in the early teen years. The violence is minimal and all the characters presented are competent and realistic.<br />As always, please read the books that your children read.

Billy who has long been trying to end Max's self imposed isolation needs his help and knows that Max won't refuse him.<br />A series of elderly women have died and the police and medical examiner's office have concluded in each case that the women died of natural causes due to age. But a daughter of one of the women has contacted Billy and asked for his help in finding out who killed her Mother. Billy agrees that something isn't right and with nothing more to go on than the strange coincidence that all the deceased women had recently sold their life insurance policies to investors, Max begins working the case.<br />However, it soon appears that something is going on and that there are links to other unsolved cases in the surrounding area. Cases that no one before had linked because of the area involved as well as an inability to see the big picture. Soon, Max is dealing with many of the members of the task force from the first book and feeling the old adrenalin surge as he chases a killer.<br />This book does not feature the intensity level of the first book. This might be because from page one, the reader knows exactly who the killer is by name, but not the motivation. As such, there is less intensity as the novel shifts back and forth from the killer's point of view to Max's and back again. This shift is not often and therefore does not serve as a distraction for the reader.<br />This sequel does feature all the complexity of the first novel as well as the further development of the Max Freeman character. Other character developments are also encouraged and tie in very nicely in the storyline as the novel moves forward. The ongoing professional confrontation between Hammond and Max should serve as major plot points in the coming novels.<br />This is another excellent read and the author has established an excellent starting point in his first two novels, which should be read in order. Hopefully, this is the beginning of a major series on the order of Sanford's \\"Prey\\" books as one example. While not widely known despite award nominations, this is an author to definitely keep your eyes on for future novels.ry nicely in the storyline as the novel moves forward.

Hiding out in one of the last solitary places on Earth, the Florida Everglades, Max has finally found some peace. Still haunted by his shooting on a nasty night as well as the aftermath, Max has learned to cope by canoeing through the dark hours from midnight to dawn when he can't sleep. The dreams don't come as often anymore but as the book opens, his inability to sleep has driven him once more into the night. His quest for peace this night ends when he finds a child's body in the roots of a tree just down river from his home.<br /> Not only does this dead child bring his past to life once again internally for Max, it also brings him to the attention of a task force. A task force chasing a child killer who has killed before and of which Max knew nothing about thanks to his self imposed exile. Already considered a suspect because of what happened in Philadelphia along with his finding the body, Max soon finds that the killer is planting additional clues, all pointed towards Max. The killer seems to have target Max as the fall guy and begins to manipulate him toward a violet confrontation.<br /> This is a first novel by this author and was simply an incredible read. Using very descriptive language in the style of James Lee Burke to create intense imagery, along with strong characters, and steady pacing, this author works all the angles for the enjoyment of his readers. Missing the flaws that often weaken a first novel, this book at 259 pages becomes a fast intense read and well worth the effort. There are not too many books that get me to stay up late to finish and this was the first one in a very long time.<br /> The author has created a sequel featuring Max Freeman entitled \\" A Visible Darkness.\\" If as good as the original, this author has created a new series well worth reading. I will be reading and reviewing this book soon.	2003-06-15

The island is the home of Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane. In a variation of the classic locked room mystery problem, the Hospital staff has lost a patient. Somehow, Rachel Solando, responsible for murdering her three children by drowning them in a lake, escaped from her locked room and past the eyes of the not so vigilant guards and staff. Teddy and his partner Chuck Aule are sent in to investigate and find the missing patient who theoretically could not have escaped the island alive.<br />What follows is a nightmarish world where reality and mental illness collide. Rumor has it that the Hospital is doing unethical, even for 1954, experiments on patients and engaged in a giant cover-up with links to the government and the Cold War. Teddy has been investigating the Hospital and its people for a long time and the missing Rachel Solando was a convenient excuse for him to get on the island. Once there, with a hurricane coming and no signs of Rachel Solando, it may prove impossible to leave.<br />As one expects from Dennis Lehane, this is another dark and gritty novel. Usually that is his style along with a tight mystery, strong character development and plenty of action. His books maybe very dark at times, but usually for a reason and usually the book are good stuff. None of that applies to this effort.<br />He is dark throughout the novel and there is some action to it. However, one does not expect such amazingly shallow character development along with contrived events like a hurricane coming towards the island. The actual cheap ending is amazingly contrived and considering all the shallowness of the novel, to be expected but leaves this reader feeling very cheated. That along with the overall depressing tone of the work, which deals extensively and graphically with mental illness, and some of the bizarre treatment methods of the past, makes this one to skip. This theme has been done better by others and simply is not even \\"good\\" under the standards set by Dennis Lehane in his earlier works.f the bizarre treatment methods of the past, makes this one to skip.

As the novel opens, Reacher has a problem. Beyond the fact that he is West Texas with daytime temperatures soaring over a hundred, a number of local police are gathering at his motel. A loud mouth drunk had poked Reacher once too many times the night before and had his knuckle snapped. Unfortunately, beyond being a drunken idiot the man in question is one of the local cops. So as the posse checks with the motel manager, Reacher makes good on his escape out a back window. But, he soon finds that maybe he should have taken his chances with the cops.<br />Hitchhiking and wondering if he can get away fast enough, he is picked up by a lovely Hispanic woman driving a white Cadillac. She has the air conditioning on high providing a bit of relief from the oppressive heat outside. He accepts her offer of a lift and soon Carmen Greer begins to ask him increasingly pointed questions about his past. Eventually, she explains that she needs her husband killed.<br />She made a mistake marrying a man that brought her home to his rich family in Texas. She says that he abused her and has beaten her repeatedly and the only reason she isn't dead is because he is a federal minimum-security prison for tax problems. But, in just a couple of days he is due to be released and she knows the beatings will start again. She can't turn to his family because they are racists and certainly won't help her.<br />Instead, she has using every penny she has to fuel her Cadillac as she crisscrosses the area trying to find a man to kill her husband. She offers everything she has, including her body, and still Reacher turns her down. He tries to explain to her that he just can't kill someone in cold blood like that. But, he does offer to come to the house and sort of hang around and maybe have a talk with her husband about things. Reacher hopes to persuade the man the wisdom of keeping his hands off his wife.<br />Soon Reacher discovers that the family is as bad as Carmen said they were, but she also left out a lot of pieces. What seems to be a domestic violence case snowballs into issues with an execution team, The Border Patrol and politics in a small rural county. The character development and strong action that are hallmarks of the series continues in this recent offering.

Like the previous two novels in the series, this one is short on plot and long on character development and scenic descriptions.<br />This latest adventure finds Anna on temporary loan from her assigned duty station on the Natchez Trace Parkway to the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park. Anna is thrilled to leave her patrol car back home and instead of traveling on the macadam asphalt, to be wandering the mountains once again. She has been assigned to assist with The Greater Glacier Bear DNA Project, which is designed through the use of special equipment, to collect various samples from passing bears in the high country of the park. The samples will be used to identify each bear individually, obtain an accurate count, and for other information.<br />Anna joins a team that will work far above the tundra in one specific area of the park. Things begin to rapidly deteriorate as the camp is attacked in the night by a bear. One researcher is discovered missing and as search parties fan out, a dead body is quickly found.<br />The cause of death is quickly established to be human, and since the park is already short staffed, Anna is reassigned to finding the killer. Her search takes her repeatedly across the scenic high vistas of the park in an almost solitary quest. The scenery and her actions are described in great detail as she slowly zeros in on the killer in a rather surprising ending.<br />While this is by no means the best Nevada Barr can deliver, Blood Lure is certainly an improvement over her last two books, Deep South and Liberty Falling. Less neurotic and introspective, and more prone to action, it reminds me a bit of the thrills in her first Anna pigeon novel, Track Of The Cat. I hope that she is back on track and will soon work her way back to the performances of her early books in this series.	2003-05-22

Picking back up with the long running and very enjoyable character of Elvis Cole, author Robert Crais is back with the latest installment of the series entitled The Last Detective. However, with several books featuring other characters and writing styles having been published from this author in the meantime, this latest Elvis Cole is written in a far different style than usual.<br />As the book opens, Elvis is babysitting his girlfriend's ten-year-old son, Ben. Lucy, his mother and Ben moved from Louisiana to be with Elvis and since they came there has been a series of problems. (Many of these are detailed full in the preceding novel of this series L. A. Requiem and as such will not be detailed here for space reasons as well as to not ruin things for readers new to the series). Lucy is still very unsettled over those events and when Ben suddenly vanishes without a trace, it brings those past events as well as current problems to the surface.<br />Along with the terror of losing a child, Lucy becomes filled with self recriminations as well as wondering if Elvis' less than stellar past is coming back to haunt them again. As a private investigator, as well as a few other things, Elvis moves in the shadows and has made quite a few enemies along the way. Ben's kidnapper works on that fear by claiming that he is doing this as revenge for something Elvis did in Vietnam. As Lucy cracks under the strain, Elvis is left feeling responsible and alone with everyone convinced that he did the unthinkable.<br />With his old friend Joe Pike, who himself is dealing with the trauma of the recent and distant past, Elvis decides despite all objections to work the case himself. He begins to unravel a dark conspiracy that has him at the center in an elaborate plan to make him the fall guy. Ben is a pawn and as events spin out of control, the stakes climb and Elvis becomes Ben's only chance at survival.<br />While enjoyable, this novel is written far differently than the other novels in the series. Not only is the overall plot and storyline less complicated than earlier novels, Elvis himself is different. While it is hard to pin down and some no doubt will criticize me for being unacceptably vague, the character of Elvis just does not read like right. I really do not know how to explain it, but there is a style and tone in the Elvis sections that does not read the way Elvis always did.<br />That might be worsened by the constant point of view shifts used in this novel. Traditionally, the Elvis Cole novels have been written from the viewpoint of the Elvis character and have rarely strayed from that viewpoint. However, in this novel, various kidnappers' points of view are presented, along with Joe Pike's, Lucy, Richard (her ex husband), Ben's, and many others. This multi point of view becomes rather distracting with the constant shifts, especially as the climatic scene takes place at the end of the book and the violent confrontation is depicted from every conceivable angle.<br />However, while there are some negatives with this book, overall it is another enjoyable installment of the series. Some of the back-story which was alluded to in previous novels concerning Elvis is fully discussed as Elvis is forced to confront his dark past. It will be interesting to see with several loose ends resolved where the author chooses to take this complicated character.

Usually the book is a disaster, the author learns a lesson and gets it out of his or her system, and goes back to what made the author worth reading in the first place. I expected the usual situation in this novel and expected to have to work my way through, reading glasses firmly in place and nose to the grindstone, to finish it. I simply dreaded this book and I could not have been more wrong.<br />It simply wasn't the case. The man best known for setting off the continuing wave of lawyer style mysteries and thrillers with his second novel, The Firm, creates a powerfully moving human story. This novel is written in a completely different style and is a remarkable change of pace from his other works. The characters are rich and developed from the beginning and as the story evolves, nuances and shading are added, changing each character in subtle, yet powerful ways.<br />The story revolves around the small world of Luke Chandler, age seven, who lives on a cotton farm in Southern Arkansas with his parents and grandparents. The family rents 80 acres and on a good year, barely breaks better than even. The depression came and never left. The year is 1952, late fall, the cotton is ready to be picked, and his uncle is off fighting the war in Korea. Luke does not want to farm and instead, wants to play ball for his beloved St. Louis Cardinals.<br />His mother hates the farming life and is determined that Luke will go to college. His father would prefer him to farm, but is willing to go with what Luke's mother wants. His grandparents are equally divided as well, with his grandfather aware that a way of life is passing by. They have rented the acreage for generations and never made enough to buy it outright. Without enough hands to pick the cotton, the Chandlers must rely on the good graces of migrant farm workers.<br />The Chandlers, like other farm families in the area, go through a yearly ritual of hiring workers as they begin to trickle into town. The farm is deep in debt, cotton prices are down, and the cost of labor is going up. But, the cotton has to be picked and everything else becomes secondary to the harvest. The harvest becomes the dominant theme of the work. A full harvest of a good crop allows them a few extra luxuries while a poor harvest or no harvest means they slide further in debt and face losing the little they rent and own.<br />The first ones hired are a family down from the Ozarks who have complex problems of their own. The Spruills are a family of seven. There are four boys and a young lady, ten years older than Luke, and he is instantly attracted to her. She is also attracted to him in a big sister sort of way, but Luke reads too much into it. The Chandlers also hire a group of Mexicans from a large pool that is trucked into town every year. Unfortunately for Luke, his friend Juan isn't with the group this year, and he is forced to deal with that fact and make new friends.<br />Against the backdrop of the unrelenting heat and the backbreaking effort to pick cotton, cultures and personalities quickly clash in deceit, treachery and murder. For Luke Chandler, this harvest will be like no other and will change his life forever. His priorities will change massively as he realizes what is truly important.<br />This is a pleasant change from the usual Grisham fare of deceitful lawyers, back stabbing judges, and corporate greed. The characters are more diverse, driven by other factors than the worship of a dollar. Grisham shows a breath of characters and writing style not shown in his previous works and I hope this was not a one-time thing. While I thoroughly enjoyed The Firm, and to a lesser extent some of his more recent works, this one was a refreshing breath of air and very enjoyable.families in the area, go through a yearly ritual of hiring workers as they begin to trickle into town.

Police officers who deal with the worst that society has to offer while trying not to lose their own decency. This novel is no exception and another pleasurable read. If this is your first exposure to Mr. Connellys prose, you are in for a real treat.<br />Harry Bosch is a LAPD detective and is currently involved in an O. J. style celebrity court case. An actress is dead, and a movie director who was last seen with her is on trial for her murder. Bosch knows the defendant did it, but proving it in a court of law under the watchful eye of the media is becoming increasingly difficult.<br />Separately, Terry McCaleb, three years after his life saving heart transplant in the earlier novel Blood Work is dragged into reviewing the death of Edward Gunn. McCaleb isnt an F. B. I. Profiler anymore, having given it up to start a new family and move on in to a less stressful life by doing fishing charters. But when contacted, he reluctantly agrees to review the case and becomes drawn in realizing that there is nothing that he would rather do than find and stop the psychos that walk among us.<br />As surprising links are formed between the case and the court trial, Mr. Connelly examines the fine line between good and evil. He poses the moral question that if a killer was going to be killed by another killer, and it could be stopped, should it? By knowing it would happen, are you responsible? After looking into the abyss so long, when do you become part of it?<br />Like his other excellent novels, Mr. Connelly once again mixes the elements of a strong plot, tough dialogue, and strong characters in his own very distinctive style. While these characters are the ones that we know and love, they are in no way static, but constantly changing and evolving. Each new novel brings about new shadings of the Harry Bosch character as well as others in the ensemble cast. A Darkness More Than Night is no exception to the rule and it will be interesting to see if what is hinted at in the ending is true.<br />If you are new to Mr. Connellys gritty work, I strongly encourage you to begin at the beginning of his series with the novel Black Echo. Like all his books, his first is filled with the trademark items that make his work so enjoyable.s in the ensemble cast.

When reading a novella anthology, one has to understand that character development will be more limited than in the traditional novel or mystery. There simply isnt the time to set up detailed and complex characters due to the restrictions in length a novella places on the work. Therefore, the author has to pack as much character development in his or her work as possible, while setting up the scene, the mystery problem (in this case) and plenty of action to move the story along. It is a difficult task and all four of these authors, with very different themes and writing styles, pull it off wonderfully.<br />At the same time, it makes reviewing the work rather difficult. One does not want to give away too many of the details and with each novella coming in around 100 pages on average (a couple are a little shorter and conversely a couple are a bit longer) it would be easy to reveal too much. The reviewer also has to take into account his or her particular interests and a couple of these were not exactly what I look for in a novel to read. Having said that, though some of the works were not my thing (as it were) it has to be admitted that those were as well written as the others in the collection, which I did really like.<br />The collection is opened by the offering from Mr. Robert L. Iles, titled The Ten-Spot Murders. Set in a small town deep in West Texas, the work revolves around a dead man found murdered at the local motel. Instead of being found in his room, he is found behind the building. How he got there and why becomes an intriguing case for Sheriff Okie Bliss and his small department.<br />Pangs of Prophecy by Christine Spindler follows next in the reading order. In this work, April is tormented by the fact that she can see death for those she knows. She knows in excruciating graphic detail how they will dieshe just doesnt know when. Trying to prevent a murder she knows is going to happen, she becomes deeply involved in the resulting case when the murder does occur.<br />The third work is titled Buyers Remorse by Elizabeth Dearl. Taylor is a writer living out in West Texas and is asked by her friend, Paula, to help her move. Paula has bought an old house and needs help, not only in moving, but restoring the house to livable condition. The problem, beyond the fact that the house is old and in disrepair, is the fact that it might also be haunted.<br />Rounding off the book is Dan Sontups work, titled the Santa Switch. While you may have secretly wished death on the mall Santa when he went ahead and promised a toy you know your child could not have in his wildest dreams, in this story, a mall Santa is killed at the mall in a back way hall. Now, Mall Security Chief Matt Ridley has to clean up the problem as well as find out who did it when the Police cant solve the case. At the same time, he has his own internal political problems and a dead Santa does not help things one bit.<br />In each work, the case is interesting and the approach each writer takes in developing his or her story is tremendously different. With such differences in writing styles, themes, etc., it makes this anthology an interesting and enjoyable read. There is something each reader will like and this is the perfect bag to fling in the tote for a day at the beach.ail how they will dieshe just doesnt know when.

The result, long in pop-psychology and various twelve-step program jargons becomes a bit heavy handed at times, but the overall story is enjoyable.<br />In this third installment of the series, Blaize is trying to figure out her relationship with the man she affectionately refers to as Z-man: Zoloski. The Police Detective and her lover has set an ultimatum for her concerning their future and wants her to commit to getting married. Because of her history of brutal abuse at the hands of her family, the idea of marriage is overwhelming.<br />At the same time, some of her extended family seems to want to reconnect, years after her father's death as well as her running away from home. Hardly before she has a chance to consider that possibility, Uncle Rich who was responsible for quite a lot of the abuse, is found murdered. Quickly, both Blaize and her brother Ian who has some shocking revelations of his own are considered suspects. With most of the clues pointing to Ian, Blaize can't leave things alone. She begins to dig and soon discovers that the abuse never stopped and the list of suspects with motive to kill is long and complex.<br />This novel is driven nearly entirely by discussions of abuse and therapy. Almost every character is extremely dysfunctional by anyone's standards and there are several stretches where different kinds of addiction are discussed and explained in great detail. For the average reader who is interested in such topics, the bibliography at the conclusion of the novel is a big help. However, while the novel is enjoyable, for readers who are looking for sheer escapism, this novel is not for you.<br />Acknowledging the fact that this novel is fairly heavy handed at times in advocating therapy for any and all problems, it must be also said that it is well written and deals with the issues it raises in a compassionate manner. With so much reliance on therapy issues, the action is limited, but what action there is serves to move the story along. Overall, it is an enjoyable read and with the brief explanations of events in the first two novels, it works as a stand alone novel from the series.hat this novel is fairly heavy handed at times in advocating therapy for any and all problems, it must be also said that it is well written and deals with the issues it raises in a compassionate manner.

Then along comes Dave Zeltserman and his book \\"In His Shadow.\\" This is a book well worth reading.<br /> Johnny Lane is a very successful private investigator in Denver, Colorado in this dark, sometimes comedic but almost always tragic, mystery novel. His business is wildly successful thanks in large part to a case a number of years ago. The resultant media attention earned him new clients as well as a column in the Denver Examiner titled \\"Fast Lane.\\" His notoriety in which he is known just walking down the street as well as his column and public appearances bring in even more clients. As such, he has a number of private investigators working for him on a case-by-case situation and he splits the fee with them with Lane taking the larger share as he took the case in the first place. For some that are working for him the deal is an issue, but Lane has more serious problems.<br />While outwardly successful, his mental stability is hanging by a thin thread and it isn't going to take much for him to lose it all. After successfully concluding as best as he could under the circumstances his previous case, Mary Williams arrives in his office. Lane is a ladies man and loved by all the women, at least in the beginning of the relationship, and he instantly attracted to her. While the young lady is beautiful, there is also something else about her that disturbs him tremendously and he does not know why. She knows she was adopted and wants to hire Lane to find her birth parents. He agrees at a fee far lower than normal for reasons he does not know himself.<br />Though she has the barest of information and over the strident objection of her parents, Lane has almost immediate success in the search. Soon a nagging suspicion that he was not able to put into words is confirmed and presents Johnny with an escalating series of problems. Not only does he find her birth parents, he finds links to his own past and events that he thought he had put long behind him.<br />I first had the pleasure of reading this novel about a year ago and even after all this time, I think it is one of the best books I have read in a long, long time. The ending has such a twist that I never saw coming and at the same time it absolutely works. Written in a Mike Hammer style with strong currents of Shakespearian tragedy, this novel is a fast read at 254 pages and full of interesting characters. The trail is full of twists and turns and slowly unravels the man behind the façade. Though tragic and dark in tone, the novel is well written and enjoyable.ing suspicion that he was not able to put into words is confirmed and presents Johnny with an escalating series of problems.

He has taken current events and extrapolated a logical futuristic setting from them while adding multi dimensional characters. At the same time, he asks fundamental technology driven questions such as when does something totally technology based, achieve human status with feelings, emotions, and the like?<br />In this future world, giant corporations run the country. The effects of global warming have come to pass, raising the world's sea levels and destroying major cities. Permanent fogs of smog have rolled in causing a perpetual acidic rain. The well to do have managed to flee to where the sun still shines, artificial islands created in places like the South Pacific and Indian Oceans. Corporations caused it all to happen as they bought off the politicians and set themselves up to run everything. The biggest corporation around is Expedite, which among other things, is the corporate sponsor of Old New York's police force. The suits make the decisions about what gets investigated not the cops.<br />Cage used to be a cop and was a pretty good one. He annoyed the powers that be, by investigating the death of Joseph Fuhlber, an Expedite computer scientist. The doctor's partner was also killed and both were classified as suicide. Both deaths were clearly murder and when Cage wouldn't leave it alone, he was booted from the force, nearly destroying his life. Cage is surviving, financially and emotionally, but just barely.<br />Janice Gild who wants her brother's death investigated contacts him. The cops aren't doing anything to speak of and the dead brother has links back to Expedite. The man was incinerated in his own condo while in bed and amazingly, the rest of the condo did not burn. While vaguely interested and in need of money, Cage does not want to run afoul of Expedite again. He grudgingly agrees while at the same time warning her, that he won't fight Expedite if they don't want it investigated.<br />Soon, he discovers that the crime scene has been tampered with and Janice Gild's brother was only one of several to strangely die by incineration. If it wasn't spontaneous human combustion, a rare event, then what is happening?  Bodies begin to pile up and Cage slowly figures out that the only help may come from the missing android domestic Jennifer Four.  But, Jennifer Four is not what she once was and has developed her own agenda and Cage may be interference to be removed.<br />This debut novel (available in a variety of formats) is very good with plenty of action and multi dimensional characters. Jonathan Lyons deftly mixes in back ground information and social commentary without sliding into preaching. He adds some downright funny parts, which I won't spoil by revealing. This is a very good book and I eagerly await Mr. Lyon's next project which this reviewer hopes just might be a sequel to this effort.

The living is harsh and violent by today&#8217;s standards, but the prizes are definitely more easily obtainable as the women know their place and are ready to please.<br />As the novel opens, Marcus (the narrator) is at the opulent home of Quintus Licus, a rich merchant in the city of Rome. Quintus is renowned for his parties and his large wife, Lydia, is known for her sexual raids on the many young military men that attend the parties. Fortunately, since Lydia is occupied, Marcus is spared from her affections. Instead, Marcus is treated to a multi page and very detailed ...from one of the rich merchant&#8217;s many slave girls.<br />...Marcus is an unhappy man. He hates being posted to Rome, which not only bores him, but also stretches his meager income further than it can go. He hates the camp life in Rome and wants to see some action. After watching a lovely blonde goddess being sold from the slave caravan, Marcus becomes inspired. He decides to ask to be reposted from Rome and wants to go North into hostile territory and claim a blond goddess of his own as well as some plunder. He decides to ask to be posted to Gaul&#8212;the frontier.<br />He is posted to a garrison by the name of Bernesium. There he will be the only officer in charge of 200 men. Bernesium has its own very rich merchant in the form of Asinus Gratius. Gratius, among other things, supplies the whores to the troops of the Garrison and reserves some very special ones for use by V.I. P.&#8217;s such as Marcus.<br />What follows is the usual good work from Don Winslow. Great descriptions of the sights and sounds and plenty of very hot sexual action. If you are into period pieces, or historical works, this is definitely one to ad to your collection. It certainly would have made studying world history all those years ago much more interesting!	2001-06-09

As a white heterosexual male that grew up idolizing John Wayne and wanted desperately to be Roger Staubach (or maybe an astronaut) I am probably symbolically what Kerwin Kay means when he writes of the privilged white male. Personally, I have never accepted the argument that I, or any other white male, are automatically privilged based on race, but I understand the argument.<br />I never thought once about my sexuality growing up and never had the gender confusion that so many others had. All I knew, was that I didn't have a chance with the girls and that the guys that did, were the guys on the football team that could barely string a sentence together. It was only after becoming a father, after my first son was born and survived an intense six-week ordeal in the Neonatal ICU wing of the local Hospital, that I began to contemplate being a male and my sexual role or identity.<br />As noted in the introduction, questions of sex and power are irretrievability linked and form the image of male sexuality. The argument is made that because the privilged male cannot recognize his own male sexuality because he is in power and he therefore must examine those that are \\"marginalized\\" or on the edge of society. He can only learn by examining the sexuality from the viewpoint of the disabled, transgendered, minority and others. He has to understand the \\"marginalized\\" view of sexuality before he can begin to contemplate his own.<br />This is done in the anthology through the use of essays, stories and poems from all points of view.  This collection covers a wide range of male sexuality and desire from both genders and various persuasions. Everyone has a voice and these voices are freely and deeply expressed. Sometimes amusing, sometimes shocking, but every perspective is covered. All brought together to make the reader think.<br />It would not be fair to single out one or two essays or points of view and comment on them. Not only would it inappropriate to consider just a couple of works, but also it would not be representative of the whole. There is an incredibly broad spectrum of work here and it needs to be considered as the whole and not as isolated bits.<br />In a textbook style format, this anthology is complex and definitely not relaxing reading. Serious work went into this well written collection and every piece of it is guaranteed to provoke inner thought and debate.works, but also it would not be representative of the whole.

Deep in his latest novel, either by odd coincidence or deliberate design, Jack Higgins writes, \\"`Well, that explains a lot. You've been damaged enough. He wanted to keep you out of it. You see, a face-to-face confrontation with Rashid will probably be like a spaghetti western.'\\"<br />Unfortunately, a spaghetti western would have more character development and plot than this work. As in his last several novels, this one seems to read more like a Greek tragedy with limited character development and style. His formulaic style continues where the good guys do evil (at times) for the right cause and the bad guys are misguided and do evil for the wrong cause.<br />In this case, the Earl of Loch Dhu, Paul Rashid, leads the evil empire. Paul is of mixed blood involving the aristocracy in England and in the province of Hazar, in the Persian Gulf. \\"The two traditions flowed together in their blood, the medieval British and the Bedouin, producing a general fierceness that was remarked upon in Paul, . . .\\" In short, a powerful man that when crossed or defied can seek powerful vengeance.<br />And vengeance is the theme and motivator for all character actions in this simply plotted novel. Rashid and his two brothers and one sister, control a large empire of holdings in a variety of interests. The sultan of Hazar, bypasses their interests, to make an oil deal with the Americans and the Russians. If that wasn't enough, the ungrateful Sultan, is also apparently part of a plot to assassinate the Rashids. The plot is easily foiled with the assassins slain in the desert.<br />Of course, such an act demands vengeance on a local level as well as at the ultimate levels in the American and Russian governments. The people that lead these two nations must die so the world will know of their actions and resulting punishment. Enter General Ferguson, Sean Dillon and the usual suspects of the British Intelligence Service who plan to stop the attacks, one way or another.<br />This novel continues in the recent tradition of Jack Higgins. The writing is weak, the character development is exceedingly limited, the style is poor and the scenic descriptions are poor. The sameness of his recent novels continues and the reader is left with the sense that this has been read before, many times. It is unfortunate that he continues in the slide from the promise of his early novels to a writing style and effort that just seems to be going through the motions for a few sales. This author has talent and expertise that he simply is not using, for whatever reason, and that is a shame.in the recent tradition of Jack Higgins.
