It is not the sometimes stiff and unusual vocabulary you can get in childrens' books that is used just to get a rhyme. <br /> <br />I did not give it 5 stars b/c the story was just a little bit awkward.  It wasn't always evident why one more monkey would have been the cause of the problem as opposed to it just being attributable to the rowdiness of the monkeys.  Never-the-less, it is an above average and fun to read kid book.	2005-10-13

It covers in a light-hearted yet factual way everything connected with pigs from breeds, anatomy, sties and mud to history, guinness records, pig latin and even a reference to Harley Davidson \\"Hogs\\".   <br /> <br />So if you'd like to know at what weight a pig becomes a hog, what to call their legs or what famous explorers they travelled with, this book is for you.  <br /> <br />P.S.  My children giggled with delight as they learned that pot bellied pigs won't poop in the house!	2005-10-13

I love the rollicking, rhyming verse punctuated by \\"My sister's on a hugging spree\\".  And, the ending is 100% perfect. The illustrations are wonderfully funny and perfectly matching with the tone of the text. <br /> <br />The only downside and this is a minor personal preference is that it is a tiny bit gross in some of its humor with bugs crawling in noses,etc  However, this hasn't stopped me from reading it.   <br /> <br />Kudos to the author for his originality!	2005-09-22

Don't let the title fool you.  It's not a boring nursery rhyme story.  The author really surprised me by using the text of a well known nursery rhyme and using pictures to tell a completely different story that never-the-less matched the words.  I just love the story twist at the end.  Very imaginative book!  The only downside is that it is very short.	2005-08-15

However, it not only gives you a way to express the depth of your love but gives children a chance to count the numbers one to 10.  I've already got a lot of counting books but I'll probably add this one to our library.  It's sweet without being too sappy.	2005-08-09

It took a little while to grow on me but I kept finding more and more depth in the pictures and the text.  The animals responses to seeing the duck ride the bike are both appropriate to each animal and humourous. e.g. the horse brags that he is faster, the dog thinks it's really cool, the cat is somewhat indifferent and the goat wants to eat the bike.<br /><br />It is also very fun to read to children.  You can be a bit silly without trying hard. Unlike some other childrens' books, I don't mind reading this frequently and it is a frequent request from my 3.5 year olds.<br /><br />The ending with the duck staring at the tractor is a fun twist.	2005-01-16

I especially like the point about not getting caught up in treating kids equally but rather individually.  They do not want to hear that you love them as much as you love their siblings.  They want to know that they are special.  As a Mom of twins, it is especially easy for me to fall into that trap and worry constantly about fairness and equality rather than their individuality. e.g. \\"I love you as Suzie, and you're my only Suzie.\\" instead of \\"I love you as much as your sister Janie.\\" <br /> <br />I don't normally read this type of book and I don't often give 5*s but this one deserves it! <br /> <br />Small portions of the book were a little dry but all in all I found it hard to put down.  The only small thing I disagreed with was the advice at one point to use a doll to act out anger.  This, however, was a minor point and was not at all typical of this excellent book.	2005-01-16

The plot was too simplistic.  It's mostly a monologue by the pigeon. I know it's meant to portray a child making appeals to get their way but it just fell flat for me.<br /><br />The drawings were also much too simplistic.  They don't have much detail or much color.  My girls (age 3.5) weren't that taken with it.	2005-01-15

However, my 3 year-olds found this a bit confusing.  The premise to the story is charming - a real bear and a boy find each others' teddy bears.  The text was the stumbling block to me.  It's hard to explain.... but for instance at one point the text referred to the [boy's] teddy bear but the illustration on the page was the bear's teddy bear.	2004-10-08

It is warmly illustrated, fun, rhyming and easy for parents and children to participate in.  I also like the variation in children (different ethnicities) and the dads that are included.  I'm not pc, it's just nice for my adopted asian children to see the variety in books.  <br />I also like that it's not all saccharine as it could easily have been.  It's got some kids misbehaving a little bit.  <br />A real charmer.  I intend to buy this for friends with young toddlers.	2004-07-15

This one has the same warm and funny illustrations, the same wit, and it's not boring to read to your kids over and over and over again.  The downside to CCM was its political/union overtones.  The only downside to Giggle, Giggle, Quack is the ending kind of fizzles unlike the charming and unexpected ending in CCM.	2004-07-15

(Their paths only cross for a matter of minutes in the book so I don't know how much there is to dispute.  Only a 3rd party witness could confirm.)   I can say about the book that...<BR>- It was hard to put down.  <BR>- It was more about the author's life than her rescue. I enjoyed this intimate look at an Iraqi's family life as much as the rescue.<BR>- It seemed at times too fantastic to be true but that may be simply because my everyday life is a cozy one in America compared to the author's in Iraq.  <BR>- Some of the atrocities are hard to read about.  I don't think this would be appropriate reading for young children.	2004-05-31

My daughters who like trains weren't either. <br />The illustrations were warm and fun and the rhyming was well done.  I guess I really didn't like the story line. It was a bit of a downer.  Everyone is having fun on the train and the engineer says he's got a headache and unless everyone is quiet, he'll turn the train around.  So by the end the engineer is happy but everyone else looks kind of sad.	2004-04-02

Some of her childrens' books are pure magic and I still smile when I read them again and again (such as Barnyard Dance, Oh My Oh My Oh Dinosaur and the Going to Bed Book).  This one just didn't do anything for me.  I love her silliness and whimsy but the total nonsense lullaby at the end was the worst.

(I don't like them all and I don't give many \\"5\\"s).  <br />This is just such a fresh fun approach to the alphabet and it uses the best of her whimsical humor.  So many alphabet books out there just use one noun for each letter but breaking from tradition she uses adjectives (gasp!) and nouns. She also doesn't use unicorn or umbrella for \\"U\\".    Great for learning.  Great for fun.  Worth every penny. <br />I'm glad it became available again.	2004-02-03

I like how subtly the names of the dinosaurs appear ... sometimes spelled out with blocks or on a bedstead.  (Thank goodness they're identified otherwise I wouldn't know them all.)  <br />The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is that the story was a little weak and it's a little pricey although for the size and illustrations it is justified.	2004-02-03

Most truck books just identify lots of variations on backhoes but this one at least has a little bit of a story.  However, to me it seemed a bit disjointed.  First they worked on the road and then the building and then the road again. It tried to be sequential but somehow never came together.  Also, it was disappointing not to see some final product (a finished building or road, etc).  I would not have bought it if I could have looked through it in its entirety.  I just relied on the reviews.	2004-02-03

I know that not all search and rescues end happily but this book has many grim endings and some graphic details.  I had a hard time reading certain sections and can't imagine what it was like for Beth Barkley to live them.  <br />Because of her amazing courage and perseverence I could not put the book down.  I'm glad I read it but I don't think it is a book I would re-read because it is so sad. <br />It doesn't have anything to do with reviewing the book but I came away wondering why on earth someone willing to face machine guns, hostile populations and sleeping in a tent in an Armenian winter had to worry about whether she could afford to take off work to go on these missions of mercy.  You couldn't pay me enough money to do what she does.  Why should anyone have to use their vacation time and be set back financially to do this?	2003-12-17

My husband has bought me a number of &quot;working dog&quot; books but this is the only one that has really &quot;clicked&quot; for me.  She manages to tell each story in such an endearing way.  You really tangibly feel the love of the dogs and their owners for each other.

Can't see why you'd want a book to do that.  I gave it a try after receiving two copies as gifts.  My daughter who loves books will see me bring it out, put her face in the couch and wail.  I think that says it all.	2003-03-14

However, after...reading it, I realized that it was a little too fanciful for me.  I don't mind a made up word or two but we're trying to teach our kids words and there are too many fanciful things \\"shoeberry, moonberry, cloudberry, trainberry, zoomberry raspberry rabbits, etc.\\"  Yes... I'll admit that there are some Dr. Seuss books that I don't like for the same reason.  It started out cute and the illustrations are warm and friendly but as a teaching tool it rates really low with me. I'll be returning it.	2003-03-14

I would agree.  This isn't the sort of topic that you want to treat lightly or have an unrealistic approach about.  However, at one point in the adoption process my husband hid the book from me because it was upsetting me so much.  I would encourage reading this book but only as a *part* of your research since it does seem to emphasize the worst case scenarios.	2002-12-10

This is a well balanced book which will help any parent of multiples keep their sanity -- as much as that is possible :)<br />The quotes were wonderful.  Many of them really rang true and gave me a sense that other families knew exactly what we were going through.  It covered all the issues that I could think of.	2002-12-10
US	52865216	RHXWFXK9ZO215	0671449028	830251474	The Going-To-Bed Book	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Charming!	This is absolutely wonderful and so far the only book my girls really love.  It's easy to read the story in an animated way and you can make believe with your kids that you're scrubbing up, brushing your teeth and rocking right along with the characters in the book. It's just short enough and charming enough that I haven't gotten tired of reading it to them yet :)	2002-11-21
