People who love their freedom and value the Alaskan way of life.<br />But you don't have to be an Alaskan to enjoy these tapes.  Bodett spins fascinating and humorous tales of smalltown Alaska that *all* can enjoy.  And when the last tape is played, the listener will find themselves wanting to hear more about Stormy Storbock, Ed and Emily Flannigan, Tamara Dupree and the infamous Doug McDoogan.<br />Bodett's writing style is simple, yet entertaining...and when he reads his own work, as he does on these tapes, his matter-of-fact humor is showcased perfectely.<br />I highly recommend these tapes - they will turn your next big-city commute into a trip to Alaska!	2001-12-14

I used it extensively in the planning phase of my recent month-long trip to China, and it was very helpful.<br />The background sections of the book are outstanding, giving the reader a solid overview of Chinese history and culture. The primary sites of interest to travelers are adequately covered as well, and so the book is very helpful in planning one's itinerary.<br />The main drawback of the volume is it's weight.  If you are backpacking in China, as I was, this book is pretty heavy to be lugging around.  Therefore, unless you are staying in China more than a couple of weeks, you might consider looking at the smaller city guides.....or ripping the necessary sections out of this book and packing only those in your rucksack.<br />Highly recommended for pre-trip planning at home.  Recommended for packing and taking to China *if* you are going on an extended trip to the country.	2001-12-13

I used this book during my recent trip to China, and although I feel that it is a solid resource and makes for enjoyable reading, it is not, in my opinion, the best book to actually bring on the trip itself.<br />I purchased this book for my trip because I have always relied on the &quot;Let's Go&quot; series as the guidebook of choice for my trips to Europe, Eastern Europe, and Russia.  &quot;Let's Go&quot; has never let me down, providing information in a concise, easy to read format that does not overwhelm the reader with &quot;too much information&quot; - sort of a &quot;less is more&quot; philosophy.  The information contained in the China guidebook was no exception:  current (one of the strong suits of the &quot;Let's Go&quot; line of guidebooks, which are updated annually), easy to read, easy to use, and with good, clear maps to follow.<br />But in China, I learned that &quot;more is more&quot;.  Because folks, you are not in Kansas (or Europe) anymore!  Very often, I felt that I could have used more information on the cities, the sites, and the culture, and I found myself wishing more than once that I'd brought my &quot;other&quot; China guidebook with me.<br />I recommend buying this guidebook to read in your trip preparation - the information contained in it is sound, there is no doubt about that.  But if I had to do it again, I'd have taken my Lonely Planet guide with me in my backpack!	2001-12-12

It is a book I refer to over and over again and is a &quot;must have&quot; for any fan of DS9 - or Star Trek, for that matter!<br />The book is broken down into seasons (one for each of the 7 years the show was on the air) with a cast snapshot and written season overview at the beginning of each section.  Next, all the episodes of that season are addressed individually - first through a detailed analysis of the storyline(s), then a section discussing how the episode was produced.  So you get a synopsis of the storyline of each episode PLUS behind-the-scenes commentary from the producers, directors, art department, and actors!!!  Additionally, there are many pictures from the episodes, and those are nice.<br />I would have liked to have seen more cast &quot;out of makeup&quot; pictures....but overall, this is an excellent book and a &quot;must have&quot; for any Trek fan!	2001-11-29

There are pictures of each of the ten &quot;regular&quot; cast members (including both Jadzia and Ezri Dax) and the two primary &quot;recurring&quot; characters of Garak and Dukat.  These pictures make up the tweleve months of the year.  And in the center of the calandar, there is a picture of the Defiant in battle.<br />The cast pictures are very nice, with the possible exception of Julian Bashir - I think they could have found a better picture of him.  With each picture is a quote from that character, and I think they picked pretty good quotes.  Additionally, the Defiant picture is nice as well.<br />I'm not particularly crazy about the boxy look of the date boxes on the calandar...but I do like the fact that they put a notation on each DS9 cast members' birthday...kind of a nice touch.<br />I think the calandar is worth the money...especially if you are a DS9 fan!!	2001-11-16

As a fellow independent woman traveler, I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Kite Strings of the Southern Cross&quot; and would recommend it to anyone interested in South Pacific travel, women's travel, or independent travel in general.<br />Laurie Gough is a talented writer and storyteller who, through this book, captures the &quot;feel&quot; of Fiji for her readers.  This book is not about giving us a &quot;to do list&quot; for Fiji...it is about capturing the essence of the islands and their people.<br />Further, it is also a much appreciated addition to the growing list of travel books by and about independent women travelers.  So often, women stay at home and wait:  wait to meet the right guy to travel with, wait until one of their girlfriends wants to go, wait until &quot;the time is right&quot; or they have enough money.  Laurie, through this book, encourages women to just pick up and GO.  And this is very important for many of us, because the adventure of discovering the courage and inner strength necessary to travel as a solo woman is one of the most important journeys of all!	2001-08-15

The book shows in graphic detail how Sean, as a troubled youth of only 15 years old, fell into a trap that would ruin his life, land him on Oklahoma's death row at 16 years old, and destroy the lives of his entire family and the family of another innocent victim.  Harsh consequences for a teen-age foray into the occult, I'd say!<br />The unflattering review of this book by another reviewer here is monumentally unfair and is clearly written by a person bent on vengeance - even almost two years after Sean's execution!  The other reviewer's comments were not directed at the contents of the book &quot;Web of Darkness&quot;, per se...but were instead directed at Sean Sellers personally (and his supporters, by proxy).  Contrary to what the other reviewer reported, Sean DID, as a matter of fact, apologise to ALL victims family members and tried his best to make amends in accordance with his deep Christian faith.  These apologies where published, among other places, on the website &quot;Friends of Sean Sellers&quot;, which was sent up a few months before his state-sponsored killing by the citizens of Oklahoma.  The apologies were clear and unmitigated - yet folks like the other reviewer here refused to accept them.  Instead, they continued (and continue still, apparently) to debase a Christian of the deepest faith, who went to his death praising the Lord in song after counseling hundreds of young people from his death row cell to NOT make the same mistakes he had made (as enumerated in &quot;Web of Darkness&quot;. These apologies, as well as other articles written by Sean, were later removed from the website not (as the other reviewer claims) because they were embarassing or unflattering to Sean in any way.  Instead, they were removed from the website by Sean's attorney pending publication in book form.<br />One interesting note: the fact that almost two years after Sean Sellers paid the ultimate price for his crimes, this other reviewer is STILL bitter and angry, only proves what death penalty opponants have known all along - that executions do not bring &quot;closure&quot; to anyone.  Only forgiveness brings that.<br />And that was what Sean Sellers was trying to get across - both in the book &quot;Web of Darkness&quot; and in his subsequent writings.the fact that almost two years after Sean Sellers paid the ultimate price for his crimes, this other reviewer is STILL bitter and angry, only proves what death penalty opponants have known all along - that executions do not bring &quot;closure&quot; to anyone.

Since it covers all of Europe, the information on any given country or city is somewhat limited - but the bottom line is that if you have this book (and a few bucks) in your rucksack, you probably won't have to worry about sleeping in the street or missing a European highlight - even if you decide to get off the train in a particular city on impulse with no reservations....and even less of a clue of what to see and do!<br />Let's Go does a great job of giving you the best sites, several choices of decent hostels or budget hotels, a list of &quot;hot spots&quot; for meeting folks, and a selection of places to eat cheap - often conveniently broken down by area of the city!  These guidebooks have an excellent, readable style, basic maps, and a frank, honest assesment of what you are in for at any given hostel or attraction - often with a little humor thrown in as a bonus (which is, by the way, an attribute which all indy travelers MUST have in abundance).<br />That having been said, if you have your destination(s) selected in advance and your travel schedule all planned out in detail, you might consider purchasing an appropriate individual country or regional guidebook instead. This book is HEAVY and bulky in a rucksack, so if you know at the outset that you will not be going to most of the countries covered, consider the country guides instead.	2000-12-01

It was invaluable to me this fall when I traveled there to visit the French town where St. Therese lived, both as a young girl and as a cloistered Carmelite nun.  <br />The maps are accurate, the historical importance of each pilgrimage site is clearly detailed, and the descriptions of what you need to be looking for at each site are invaluable.	2000-12-01

This is due to a number of reasons.<br />First, because I have found Pelton's accounts of various places I personally have been to be accurate, I trust the author.  And trustworthiness is an important characteristic of a writer in Pelton's position - ie. advisor to individuals contemplating travel into some of the world's most dangerous places.<br />Second, I keep going back to DP because I enjoy Pelton's style.  He is a no-nonsense, &quot;tell it like it is&quot; guy...but he never loses his sense of humor - an essential quality to have when traveling in places that are dangerous, uncomfortable, or inconvenient.<br />Third, I find this book invaluable, not only because of the excellent travel advice dispensed, but also because, for me, reading each new edition of DP is like getting an update in worldwide current events - but NOT from the network TV drones who report only what America wants to hear!  No...Pelton tells us the TRUTH - from the inside.  Not some watered-down, American-propagandized version.  For example, I first came to admire Pelton a few years ago after I spent a year in Russia and central Asia:  his coverage of Russia and Chechnya was excellent - and accurate.  And nothing like what was reported on American TV.<br />It is for this last reason that I would recommend DP to anyone - not just to those considering travel to the world's war zones and crime centers.

I would highly recommend &quot;Among the Lowest of the Dead&quot; to anyone who wants to challange themselves and discover what the death penalty is really about in the United States.<br />The book is written by a journalist who knows the players on both sides of the issue, but is not one of them.  This fact lends the book a degree of unbias that is not often found in books on this subject.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone - it is an excellent way to educate onesself with regard to this life-and-death issue.  I would especially recommend it to students, however, as it would be an excellent resource for essays and papers on the topic.	2000-12-01

What a journey!<br />Merton writes in a clear, matter-of-fact, self-depreciating style that is quite attractive.  He makes the reader feel as &quot;if this too, could happen to them&quot;, because Merton himself is portrayed as just a common man - filled with sin and propensity for wrong decision-making, but on the road to God nevertheless.<br />Merton shows us that our religious conversion is more than just a point in time:  it is a journey in God.<br />I would especially recommend this book to young adult Catholics and those who were not in the Catholic Church during the pre-Vatican II period.  The book goes into a fair amount of detail regarding Merton's experience in that Church, and for this reason, might be of interest to those who have come into the Catholic Church since the mid-1960's.	2000-12-01

This final volume is the last in a simply superlative set, every volume of which is a &quot;must have&quot; for any Merton devotee.<br />As the books are journals that were not really intended for publication, the voice is not &quot;Thomas Merton, Best-Selling Author and Religious Thinker&quot;.  The voice we hear now is &quot;Thomas Merton, Sinner Just Like the Rest of You, But Doing the Best He Can&quot;.  And the bottom line is that I really like this voice!  I like Merton!  Not just the best-selling author Merton, but the every-day guy Merton - who makes mistakes, gets angry or even irratible, and sins in spite of himself.<br />Highly recommended for any Merton fan, but also of interest to religious scholars and biographers (the books are well indexed) and even everyday folks who are merely interested in the life and times of a Trappist monk in the 20th century.	2000-12-01

But while it was entertaining enough, I didn't feel that it was up to DP's usual standards...so I found myself being mildly disappointed.<br />I guess that when it comes down to it, I felt that the book was not meaty enough for a Pelton offering.  The chapters were fairly short and I don't really feel that enough specifics were given about any given survival situation for the book to be truly useful in the field.  Often, I felt like I was being given the &quot;executive summary&quot; rather than the specific details I would need to stay alive under trying circumstances.<br />Because I'm a DP fan, I know that Pelton can do better than this.  This book won't stop me from reading other Pelton offerings, but I'm hoping that, like DP itself, it will evolve year by year and edition by edition into a truly excellent book.	2000-12-01

However, this one, while okay, was not up to his usual standard.  It starts out a bit slow, for one thing...always a negative in a mystery novel.  And while we did have the comfortable usual &quot;cast of characters&quot; of the Alex Delaware series, I guess that I'd like to see some new aspects of these characters.   Finally, I'd like to see some more &quot;realistic&quot; portrayals of the criminals in the series - reinforcing the public's mind that &quot;all people in prison are instrinsically evil sociopaths&quot; is not really serving the public good.

And further, how that principal was fulfilled thru the forgiveness and mercy spoken of in the New Testament. I won't lie - this book is a tough, long read.  But the author leaves no religious stone unturned, and I give him credit for that!	2000-11-21

Written from the perspective of Mumia Abu-Jamal, who is perhaps America's most outspoken and noteworthy death row inmate, life on Pensylvaina's death row is explained in graphic detail.  From the outrageous hassles and hardships of everyday life to the injustice and inhumanity perpetrated by a very UN-just criminal &quot;justice&quot; system...Mumia does not hold back. Mumia has suffered alot of unecessary harassment in Pensylvania's prisons due to the publication of this book.  We owe it to him (and other on the row) to at least listen to his voice and consider the &quot;other side of the story&quot;...if only for a moment.	2000-11-21

This is because the book makes art &quot;fun&quot;, even to those who are less than enthuiastic. I agree with the other reviewer that this book is sorta like a &quot;Europe's Art Museums for Dummies&quot;.  But Rick's amusing style makes it more than that - it makes the subject downright entertaining! And there is, of course, the picture that we could all relate to entitled &quot;Another Victim of the Louvre&quot;.  Wow - don't I know it!	2000-11-21

Jam-packed with history, statistics, trends, and lots of vital information, this book is a must-have for any serious anti-death penalty activist.	2000-11-21

It's so refreshing to read books that are not strewn with violence and sex...yet which captivate your attention.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants some good wholesome entertainment and an occasional chuckle.	2000-11-21

While all that he says is true about our unjust and &quot;stacked&quot; system of capital defense work, I worry that his personal conculsion - to personally &quot;opt out&quot; of the system, will result in even more executions. It must be hard to continue to work in a system that is stacked against your clients from the very beginning....but I'm not sure if refusal to participate is the answer.  Perhaps an alternative...but not an answer.	2000-11-21

I also enjoy his &quot;back door&quot; philosophy, which makes Europe into more than just an &quot;Epcot Center-like&quot; attraction. His Rome guidebook is fairly small and lightweight as well, which is a plus for those who take his sage advice and pack light!	2000-11-21

With the exceptions of &quot;Story of a Soul&quot; and the other writings of the Saint herself (the volumes of letters, poems, and prayers), this book offers the deepest insight into who  Therese was and how she lived every moment of her life in complete love  with her Lord.  Highly recommended.	1998-12-28

It provides invaluable information about the life of this Saint and about her relationships with her parents  and sisters. In addition, the book provides critical insight into daily  life at the Lisieux Carmel during the time of St. Therese.  Highly  recommended for a fuller understanding of this Doctor of the Church.	1998-12-28

Merton shows that one need not be a saint to enter religious life in a  monastery:  one only needs to be open to hearing the voice of the Lord and  to following His will. I would strongly recommend this book - especially to  individuals interested in entering the Catholic Church or to individuals  contemplating religious life.	1998-11-07
US	52997241	R2TOZ6SQGX2RZA	0875521304	5708941	Roman Catholicism	Books	1	52	74	N	N	Outrageous pack of lies	As a former protestant turned Catholic, I have done substantial research  myself into the doctrinal basis of Catholic Church teaching.  And my  conclusion: this book is at best an example of poor scholarship.......but  is probably more likely a deliberate attempt to spread anti-Catholic  propaganda to unknowing protestants.  If you want the TRUTH about Catholic  Church doctrine, better to read Karl Keating's &quot;Catholicism and  Fundamentalism&quot; or Alan Schreck's &quot;Catholic and Christian&quot;.  If you are gonna disagree with Catholic Church doctrine, at least know what  the actual doctrine IS!!!	1998-10-13

He addresses each of the misconceptions held by many anti-Catholics and proves his arguments for the true Catholic position based on scripture and actual historical and archeological evidence.  Keep up the great work, Mr Keating!	1998-02-10
