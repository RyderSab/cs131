Pauline Sokol hates her job as a nurse and feels that she needs a career change.  When her roommate lands her a job as an Insurance Fraud Investigator, she wonders if she's bitten off more than she can chew.  One thing leads to another and she actually starts to get the hang of spying on people, getting caught in rain storms, then staking out houses in sub-zero temps, while dressed in high heels and her parka.  When Jagger (we never do learn his last name) shows up all-mysterious and asks her to go undercover to help his investigation, Pauline is convinced that he's with the FBI.  Working with Jagger is a little unsettling on Pauline's nerves.  Not only is he drop-dead gorgeous, he's also over-bearing, bossy and stubborn; just the kind of guy she tries to stay away from.  But the bad thing is, she can't seem to stop fantasizing about Jagger.   <br /> <br />If you're looking for a fun, easy read then this is the story for you.

The basic story line was ok..Man and woman meet, sparks fly, and because each has refused to ever marry; they ignore the deeper feelings between them and just have an affair. In come meddling  relitives and a jealous mistress and that's it!  The main characters were  fairly strong but the secondary characters were very weak and not developed  enough.  Mabye if the book were longer in length (it is only 288 pages  long) she could have developed characterization better.  Another thing I  did not like about the story was the profanity.  I mean &quot;come on&quot;  how many times do we need to read the &quot;F&quot; word in one sentence  let alone on one page. Better than half of the book had the &quot;F&quot;  word on each page at least once and on several pages it was said several  times, used both in context and in casual conversation. If you ask me, that  particular word may have been used in regency England (as it is so often  today), but give a reader a break and stick with the sensuality and romance  that we buy these books for.
