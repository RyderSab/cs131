US	52862970	RB36OEZUAFETX	0967883806	756837299	Plantation Secrets	Books	2	9	10	N	Y	Absurd Plot	I purchased this book thinking it would be in a historical setting on a Louisiana plantation.  It is a Louisiana plantation, but the setting is contemporary.<br />If you are reading this book in hopes of a lot of passionate gay action, you won't get any at all before page 170.<br />Instead we get a male character, who after marriage and 5 children, gets a little jolt that reminds him that--\\"Oh by the way, I'm gay.\\"  Funny how a little thing like sexual orientation can just slip one's mind.<br />After that, we have people who hate each other suddenly begin making love, and other unlikely behavior.<br />In addition to unbelieveable characters, unintentionally humorous plot and stilted dialogue there is also the amateurish writing style.<br />Read only if you want to be amused.  Reminded me of the time  Lucy Ricardo's writing effort was included in a book guiding beginning authors, under the chapter \\"Don't Let This Happen To You.\\"<br />Mr. Rideout might want to consider taking some writing courses, perhaps his local college offers night classes.	2003-03-08

US	52862970	R1DP29Z1Z8UOG9	1551112930	692089716	The Rebel of the Family (Broadview Literary Texts)	Books	4	4	7	N	Y	Enjoyable Novel	This novel was written in the late 1800's, so I was somewhat leery of its readability, but I found it quite readable, and a highly enjoyable story.<br /><br />Having been written in the era in which it was set,1880, I felt made it more realistic.<br /><br />The story centers around a widow, Mrs. Winstanley, and her 3 daughters.  They have the lineage to be \\"ladies\\" but not the financial means.<br /><br />In 1880 England, the \\"new woman\\" was just emerging--women who wanted other options than marrying for security.<br /><br />Mrs. Winstanley and two of her daughters, Thomasina and Eva, however, are bent on finding security the old customary way--by marriage to \\"suitable\\" gentlemen, foregoing love on the part of the young women.<br /><br />Perdita, however, is the rebel of the family, she wants to have something useful to do in the way of an occupation until true love appears.  Perdita's clumsy honesty threatens her mother, Mrs. Winstanley's carefully laid plans and leds to considerable dissension between this middle daughter, her mother & her two sisters.<br /><br />The oddest thing about the book, to me, was the fact that Deborah T. Meem, who edited and I assume had a great deal to do with bringing it back into print--severely critiques the author, Eliza Lynn Linton.  Ms. Meem claims Ms. Linton did not understand herself.  Perhaps Linton didn't understand herself, but I don't think Ms. Meem understood Linton either.<br /><br />The opinion I garnered was that Eliza Lynn Linton was not necessarily the hypocrite and foe of women's rights Ms. Meem accuses her of being, but rather that Ms. Linton did not approve of radicalism, and believed marriage should be based on love.	2002-12-31

It was a rare find.<br /><br />The novel revolves around two women, Tranby Quirke, a 34 year old spinster who is teaching a course for 'Modern Young Women', and is a secret feminist, and her 19 year old student, Mrs. Lysette MacDonald, a very unhappily married lady.<br /><br />Tranby is reluctant to become involved with Lysette, as the information on \\"inverts\\" as homosexuals were called in that time, was quite negative and she was risking her career and reputation.<br /><br />The ending is unexpected, and with a marvelous, quite believable twist to it.<br /><br />An altogether delightful story.  My only compliant was the portions of the book containing the \\"Dear Lysette\\" letters by Tranby, which at times I found a bit morbid, so I focused mainly on the real story.  I confess I skipped the next to last chapter entirely because it was nothing but one of those rambling letters.<br /><br />However, it is quite important the reader read the Dear Lysette letter in the last chapter, or they will miss the ending,and what is happening with the characters all comes together.<br /><br />The \\"letters\\" were the reason the novel got 4 stars rather than 5.<br /><br />The \\"romantic feelings\\" of Tranby for Lysette are what I enjoyed most about the book.	2002-11-25

That was one of the main reasons I bought it.<br /><br />To me a thriller indicates suspense, tightening tension, and an unusual, exciting climax/ending to the story.  This novel has none of those ingredients.<br /><br />At 413 pages, this draggy book about a negative lesbian love affair, is very repetitive.  The storyline is rather thin, involving two women: Alix, a seemingly heterosexual woman who is happy with her male lover(s), but then becomes romantically involved with Tansie, a lesbian woman whose erratic behavior is briefly said to be due to an abusive childhood--which is never examined.<br /><br />As another reader here noted, and I couldn't agree more, the writer does not give us any depth with these characters and does telling, but not showing.<br /><br />The words \\"internalized homophobia\\" are never used, but in my opinion that is the main problem in their relationship.<br /><br />The reader is even cheated sexually because there are no sex scenes per se in the book, although the characters spend an inordinate amount of time making love.	2002-11-17

We follow Lisette's hopes and fears as she attempts to recover from the recent death of her musically talented father by taking on a position at Severon Castle.<br />Lisette soon discovers the person she has been hired to help is the musically talented, handsome & tormented Damon Severon.  She is to be his assistant in composing the music for a play.<br />The excellent plot, which kept me guessing right up until the mystery was finally revealed, mainly revolves around the beautiful deceased actress Serephine Severon, whose past existance and desires still effects the lives of all who knew her.<br />The characters are well drawn, vivid and emotional with very individual personalities, which plays into the actions they take<br />and moves the plot forward smoothly.	2002-03-14

She did very well, and I think her next novel will be even better.	2001-09-23

They do find some<br />happiness, but just like in real life--everything isn't sunshine and rosebuds.<br /><br />The only disappointment I had with this book was that the heterosexual acts were graphically reported, but we are denied the sexual side of the lesbianism.	2001-09-23

One of them is Cathelin O'Cameron, a strong warrior woman also known as the knight, Blacksunne. The other is a beautiful Muslim woman, Madrigal, who has known slavery. The story revolves around these two women, their growing love for one another, and those who would plot against them.<br /><br />I especially liked the way the author used expressions and language of that time period, also attitudes and the environment were very well described so that I felt the characters, their story and their surroundings all fit together.	2001-08-30

A good editor would have caught the author's use of repetitive phrasing.  The author too often uses the phrase &quot;shook herself out of her revelry&quot; or  &quot;she shook her head&quot;, &quot;shaking her head...&quot;,etc.  Along with overworking the term &quot;grazier&quot; and &quot;the older woman.&quot;<br />I do think this author shows promise and I look forward to other works by her.	2001-08-20

Even finding a book on Native American women and their lives can be a rarity, but finding one of the high quality of this book is an even greater rarity.<br />This novel was so good that I gave it to my partner of 31 years for our anniversary.  Needless to say, she loved it as much as I do.<br />Set in the 1700's the novel successfully explores the culture of the Lakota Sioux.  The author also, just as skillfully, shows the white people's view of things.<br />All of this is combined with a beautiful love story.<br />The book is well written, nice pacing, and with characters that I came to care about deeply.<br />I am anxious for Ms. Redhawk to oblige us with more novels that involve Native American life and characters.	2001-07-09

That has led me to the belief that this is a very multi-layered book.<br />The characters are very well drawn, and the writing is excellent.  The way Ms. Wilson depicts various types of lesbian personalities and the lesbian community is very true--I've certainly met people just like the ones portrayed in this book.<br />The story revolves around a central lesbian character whose long term relationship has disintegrated.  She chooses various ways to try and find a new love in her life.  She also, at first, avoids the pain of grieving over her lost relationship.  She does this by reading a book about the St. Petersburg Siege, to wondering about various women and whether she could fall in love with them and it could work or not.<br />I think almost anyone of any gender or sexual orientation who has gone through the end of a relationship and the throes of searching too soon, and too desperately, for a new one could relate to this heroine and this story.<br />I can't recommend this book highly enough.	2001-04-24

It is frequently violent, disturbing and outside the norm of most people's experiences, whether straight or gay.<br />This is the story of Sofia, a sort of perpetual victim, who becomes caught up in frentic sexual activity that she sometimes thinks is love.<br />The book begins with a violent scene between the three main characters, then flashes back.<br />We learn of the s/m relationship between Sofia and Santiago, the man who eventually becomes her husband, and of Sofia's lesbian relationship with Marina.<br />Although unrelated, the two women are exact mirror images of each other.  However, I wouldn't call this a true lesbian novel.  Its focus is narcissism.<br />What ultimately happens to Sofia is very much in keeping with the tone of the novel's unusual characters and situations.	2001-04-04

Each woman's chapter is told in the first person.  Since the characters are virutally interchangeable this makes for a bit of confusion at times as to which woman is speaking.<br />The storyline is really not what I would call plot-driven, and the women tend to have the same experiences.  At least two of the women, without an inkling of any past lesbian feelings, suddenly fall head over heels in love with another woman.  The way the two women's separate experiences are written are almost identical, right down to the descriptive:  &quot;my breasts began to spark/sparkle.&quot;<br />All but one woman either is lesbian or suddenly becomes lesbian, a rather unlikely prospect given that 3 of the women are related, and the others are all childhood friends.<br />I would like to add that Ms. March wrote a wonderful novel &quot;The Hide and Seek Files&quot;, and I highly recommend it.	2001-02-05

Because while I,<br />personally desired a different reaction from the main character, Kathrin, I've come to realize she behaved the way most young women in the 1800's would have.<br />Kathrin is a young woman whose inability to think &quot;outside the box&quot; of traditional ideas, leds her to make some very bad decisions. By the time she realizes this, the course has been set and circumstances are such her options have become quite limited.<br />Kathrin causes not only herself a great deal of unnecessary anguish, but tremendous emotional pain for Violet Waverly, as well.<br />The book ends before the two main characters meet again, but<br />knowing the characters so well by that time, I felt happiness<br />was surely within reach.	2001-01-17

I don't come across very many books that I consider literary classics, but this one definitely fits that catagory.<br />Set in Victorian England in the 1800's, the book gives a very clear insight into life in those times, especially life for women who remain unmarried. It also gives a look into spiritualism, and the conditions of women's prisons.<br />The book moves at a leisurely pace and lulls the reader into thinking not much is really happening, but like a river with a still, dark surface, there are undercurrents beneath.<br />The author is a master of language and writing technique. She skillfully layers the story, and when you reach the conclusion, you will be both stunned and yet see how very logically it all comes together like the perfectly fitting pieces of a puzzle.	2001-01-10

The book is fairly long, consisting of 3 parts, and around 360+ pages, but the author has more than enough story to fill those pages.  At no point did my interest flag.  None of this book is &quot;filler&quot;, it is all well plotted, well written and moves at a good pace.<br />The heroine, Charlotte Tate, is a high-spirited young woman, who has her human frailities and flaws, which adds dimension to this character.<br />So much happens in this book I couldn't begin to relate even half of it, nor would I want to give away the plot.  It involves the heroine's yearnings for fame and success as well as her urge for revenge.<br />Charlotte is clever and manages to generally get what she wants, but frequently she pays a very high price indeed.  The author does not spare her heroine from pain and disaster.  This book will surprise you with its detail and strong narrative.	2000-10-31

Her mother is dying of bone cancer, and her  and her older sister are sold by her father. <br />Her sister is taken to a  house of common prostitution, but Chiyo, the heroine who is narrating the  book, is taken by a Okija (Geisha house). <br />Geisha, I learned, are  entertainers--they sing, dance, tell stories, make jokes, and carry on  interesting conversations with the patrons of tea houses. <br />They also  become the mistresses of very wealthy Japanese men. I always thought the  Geisha got to choose who would be her dannae (her wealthy patron) but as it  turns out, they have very little sayso over it at all. The deflowering of  their virginity, which occurs at around age 14 or 15, goes not to a man  they might like, but to the highest bidder.

Beth chose instead to marry.<br /><br />Now Beth, unsuited to the  life of wife and mother of two young children, feels the misery of her choice.<br /><br />She begins to dream of Laura. She begins to long again to have a  woman in her life to love.<br /><br />In her quest for lesbian love she becomes  involved with Vega, a beautiful, sophisticated, many times married woman.

She finds many surprises along the way, and  eventually happiness.<br /><br />Although the characters certainly are not into  \\"Gay Pride\\", the book is very realistic in it's portrayal of what  life was like for lesbians before Stonewall.	1999-03-15

It made me laugh outloud, and kept me guessing.<br /> Set in Barcelona, Spain, the environment is so well reflected in the book, Ms. Wilson definitely is either familiar with the area and it's people, or did extensive research.<br /> The narrator, Cassandra, is kept guessing as much as we are, as the plot twists and turns--but never loses it's reader.<br /> No one is really as they initially seem, from the character, Frankie, who hires Cassandra to find her husband Ben, right through to a surprise about Ben's girlfriend, April!<br /> One of the things that makes this mystery unique is the fact it doesn't revolve around the usual murder.<br /> Everything about &quot;Gaudi Afternoon&quot; is refreshing and unique.	1998-07-01

The book ends when the main character is only 15, leaving many unanswered questions.<br />One gets the impression that it is quite likely she becomes a lesbian, but we never really know.<br />The main character grows up in what I assume to be a black ghetto. Her family disintegrates early on. The mother means well by her children but is promiscious, which adds to the family's problems.<br />As is frequently the case in these situations, the characters seem to lack the ability to grasp the long term consequences of their actions.<br />The book is written with a great deal of honesty and raw truth.	1998-06-18

The rest they simply knock away from them.<br /> While the beginning attitude towards the cats was unpleasant, it was only a mild warm-up for Ms. Carr.<br /> There is a scene where a woman in the harem dies after giving birth.

For some unknown reason she falls down badly on this one.<br /><br /> This novel is one of those stories within a story, that rarely work well.<br /><br />In this case we begin with Laurie who lives with herboyfriend, Joe.<br /><br />The year is 1960.<br /><br />Laurie goes on a vacation without Joe. She goes to visit her long time, best friend, Eveleen, who lives on a ranch.<br /><br />Once there, Laurie is coerced into sitting up until the wee hours of the morning listening to stories of several women that Eveleen's Great, Great Grandmother is determined to tell Laurie about.<br /><br />Great, Great Grandmother is 102 years old, and time is running out for her.<br /><br />Grandma's voice as narrator is dropped, thankfully, as each of these women's stories is told.<br />The stories are all quite similiar--each woman &quot;gets caught&quot; by some unreasonable man: a brother, husband or father who is displeased with the woman's non-traditional thoughts and actions, and sees to it that she is carted off to a mental institution.<br /><br />As we progress thru these women's stories, each story becomes less detailed, and less shown.<br /><br />By the time we get to the last character, Sadie, the story becomes so lacking in detail, one can only wonder what led the character into her concluding situation.<br /><br />When Laurie begins hearing the voices of these women from the past--the story really gets goofy.<br /><br />The only part of this book I liked was that the women in Grandma's stories were all from the eighteen hundreds.	1998-04-26

Like many first novels, it probably does not live up to what will later be the author's potential.<br /><br />The story, such as it is, revolves around a lesbian woman named Lee Brant. Her grandmother is in a nursing home, her grandfather having passed on, and Lee comes to live at their vacated farm in the mountains of Tennessee.<br /><br />There she renews her friendship with her old childhood \\"sweetheart\\" Kay Holt. Nothing beyond one kiss ever happened between them in the past.<br /><br />We discover Lee has an unusual gift--she is able to go inside others minds and see and feel through them. This \\"gift\\" only serves a useful purpose one time. The rest of the time it doesn't amount to anything.<br /><br />The most outlandish of this going inside something mentally--is when she decides to \\"connect\\" with a tree. I don't know, but I don't think plants can be connected with mentally.<br /><br />Most of the book is taken up with aimless horseback rides, and extremely banal conversations about everyday chores and tasks.<br /><br />What Lee is doing for income while living on this little farm is never explained. Lee also has a stiff leg from an automobile accident that occurred some time in her recent past. Although this was apparently traumatic for her, it is never really examined in any way. And like most of the things in this book really doesn't come to anything.	1998-04-17

Kindred is the story of a modern day black woman, Dana Franklin. She and her white husband Kevin, have just moved into a new house. She is unpacking books, when she is suddenly overcome by a strange dizziness. The scene around her blurs and she finds herself beside a river with a young white boy drowning in it.<br /><br />Then suddenly Dana finds herself back in her own world and time, which is 1976.<br /><br />Within a short period of time in 1976, however, she is pulled back again into this other world, which turns out to be in the 1800's in the antebellum south. This time several years have gone by in the 1800's. Yet each time she returns to 1976, only a short period of time has elapsed.<br /><br />The antebellum south is a dangerous place for a black woman, and a well-educated black woman is regarded with even more suspicion.<br /><br />Her life becomes more and more complicated with each return to the past.<br /><br />This is an intricately woven story and reflects a part of American History in a way that is rarely presented.<br /><br />The twists and turns of the plot are unexpected, but totally believable. I became completely involved with this character.<br /><br />The book is written in the first person, in a literary, but highly direct and readable style.<br /><br />I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys an interesting, well written tale in a historical setting.	1998-04-05

I simply am in love with big, old houses.  I adore looking at them in person, photographs, or drawings.<br /> The  black and white drawings in this slim volume are excellently done and quite detailed.  It made me long for more.<br /><br />For those who are interested, the book also shows floor plans,front and side views of the house,  and details regarding the various designs used on doors and windows.  It also tells exactly how to build one of these marvelous &quot;cottages,&quot; even referring to things past, such as cisterns, and pumps in the kitchen.<br /><br />The &quot;cottages&quot; are quite large, more what we, nowadays, would think of as mansions.  All the houses are at least two stories.  They feature such things as dormers and bay windows and porches, all the things that so delight the heart of a lover of Victorian architecture.  I know I was delighted with this book.	1998-04-01

It has the same kind of droll style and sense of humor about the human condition.<br /><br />The characters are what one would call a bit off center, just slightly eccentric.  Actually a lot like people are in real life.<br /><br />The author has a master's skill at the use of words and language. Her descriptive comparisons literally made me chuckle outloud every page or two.<br /><br />Nothing about this book bored me in the least.  I did no skimming with this novel.<br /><br />The book's main character is an artist named Lacy Blackwood.  Lacy has  desires, fears and insecurities like all human beings, and is quite easy to identify with.<br /><br />In the beginning, Lacy appears to be a bi-sexual woman.  She had an early intensely romantic and erotic interlude with another girl.  When that ended she moved on to a couple of disasterous relaitonships with men, one of whom she married.  It ended in divorce.<br /><br />Lacy currents lives with her younger brother, Franco.  Franco is delightfully wacky.  To cover up some of his antics, Lacy refers to him as a \\"priest, sort of,\\" and hopes nobody will ask any more questions.<br /><br />In addition to looking after her dependent brother, Lacy also soft-heartedly takes in a homeless woman named Mrs. Crooks.<br /><br />Lacy becomes involved with a beautiful woman named Shane.  Shane, however, is involved with every woman that passes her way.<br /><br />The book doesn't exactly come to a conclusive ending--as Lacy, Franco and Mrs. Crooks drive off \\"into the sunset.\\" together.<br /><br />Some things are resolved, however, to a certain extent.<br /><br />I only wished the book were longer.  I thoroughly enjoyed every one of the 160 pages of this slim novel.<br /><br />It's the kind of book one reads to find out what happens to the characters, and then wants to pick up and re-read again, once you know those answers, just to enjoy the ride!er.

I know it helped save mine.<br /><br />The novel revolves around Laura who has left college because Beth, her first lover, chose to marry a man rather than continue the relationship with Laura.<br /><br />Laura, an enigmatic young woman, delicately blonde, tries to turn her back on her lesbian feelings, and live her life with no emotional involvement.<br /><br />Fate has other things in mind for Laura. Thru her roommate Marcie and Marcie's ex-husband, Burr, Laura meets a cyncial, witty, highly intelligent and closeted gay man, Jack.<br />And thru Jack, Laura meets one of the most famous butch lesbian characters of all time, the boyishly handsome, charmatic Beebo Brinker.<br /><br />I have read and re-read this book perhaps a dozen times or more, and will undoubtedly read it yet again.	1998-03-27

Sexual expression is forbidden outside of marriage, and the party decides when or if you will marry. Romantic love is considered a bourgoise lie.<br /><br />Anchee is raised on Madame Mao aka Comrade Jiang Ching's operas of revolutionary heroines for the rise of Communism. Any other form of entertainment expression doesn't exist in China. Everything is for the good of the people's party.<br />The Party decides how you can best serve. The Party assigns what job you will do.<br /><br />At sixteen, Anchee is sent to a large, communal farm. There, she makes an emotional and sexual connection with a woman she greatly admires.<br /><br />However, it seemed to me the two women did not necessarily have lesbian sexual orientations. It was more a matter of two people starved for human love and contact in a harsh, barren world.<br /><br />Eventually Anchee is choosen to be an instrument in furthur spreading the message of Communism. This takes her into a different world from what she has known with her parents or at the communal farm.<br /><br />However, when Chairman Mao dies, everything falls apart. Chairman Mao's wife, Comrade Jiang Ching has powerful enemies.<br /><br />I think this is a good book, and well worth reading. It gives a great deal of insight into what life was like in China at that time.	1998-03-26

Her parents have too many children. The father is a selfish, worthless, alcholic, and the mother usually pregnant and overworked. There is a great deal in this environment that causes emotional and mental trauma for Grace Marks.<br /><br />She eventually escapes the horrors of her family life, working as a maid for a wealthy family. She develops a close friendship with another maid, Mary Whitney. When tragedy befalls Mary Whitney, it furthur traumizes Grace.<br /><br />When she goes to work for a Mr. Kinnear, trouble is already afoot in the household.  Add to this, the fact Grace is far too pretty for her own good.<br /><br />Much of the plot turns on the class systems of the mid 1800's, as well as an extreme double standard in regards to women.<br /><br />The answer to Grace' innocence or guilt is revealed in an interesting psychological twist<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed this book, and found it thoroughly fascinating reading.	1998-03-02

I liked the way the author kept the characters and environment in a historical setting. All too often I see so-called historical novels with characters who are behaving like people of the 1990's.<br /><br />I also liked both of the main characters, Isbella Wiston and Hope Bishop. Isbella Wiston is the daughter of the land-gentry class, while Hope is from peasant type people.<br /><br />Both of the women in the book are quite young, teens or perhaps early twenties.<br /><br />Hope initially meets Isbella when she (Hope) subsitutes as a piper in the all male group of dancers called the Mossmen.<br /><br />Isbella asks Hope if she will be her maid---or lady in waiting, as it is also known. This pleases Hope, as she has wanted very much to get closer to Isabella.<br /><br />The political actions of Isbella' s family, involving her two brothers, James and Alistar leds to Isbella and Hope having to flee.<br /><br />While Isbella and Hope end up in a somewhat unlikely situation at the conclusion of the book, I, nonetheless, found the novel, overall, quite satisfying.	1998-02-22

Coming out stories are of special interest to me.<br /> This book is exceptionally well written.

Ms. Little definitely comes through for her readers.<br /><br />  She writes in a clear and direct manner that is quite readable.<br />  I found myself not wanting to put this one down.<br /> The characters are well drawn, and individualistic.<br /><br /> The setting is primarily a U.S. military base.<br /> The story revolves around Elen McNally, a young, tough woman who enlists in the Army.<br />  At the beginning of the book, Elen believes herself to be a heterosexual woman<br />  She forms a tight, connected friendship with Nikki a self-acknowledged lesbian<br /><br /> Elen's heterosexuality gets an unexpected, jolting challenge.<br /><br /> Thus begins Elen's journey into her true self.<br /><br /> The inner journeys of these two women, and the decisions they make are excellently handled by Ms. Little.	1998-01-28

US	52862970	R1RR8L8M4O4CWW	156341029X	34783633	Stone Butch Blues	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Gut Wrenching	While this book is suppose to be a novel, it definitely reads like the author lived it. I have read, and re-read this book several times.<br /><br />This book tells the story of a very butch lesbian woman named Jess, who lives in the blue collar world of factories during the 1950's.<br /><br />She knows she's different almost from the day she is born. It makes it impossible for her to fit in until she finds the bars in Buffalo with the aid of Butch Al, an older butch, who is her mentor. There Jess fits in, falls in love, but also endures the horror of the bar raids.<br /><br />It gets harder and harder for Jess to cope. She makes the decision to \\"become a man.\\"<br /><br />At first life seems easier as a man, but ultimately it leads to devastating loneliness.<br /><br />When she returns to the lesbian world, however, she finds it has changed and left her behind.<br /><br />Much of this book is gut wrenching in the agony of human loneliness the heroine experiences, as well as the physical horrors she endures from the \\"so called normal\\" world.<br /><br />The ending does, however, give both the reader and the heroine hope of a brighter, more tolerant future..	1998-01-28
