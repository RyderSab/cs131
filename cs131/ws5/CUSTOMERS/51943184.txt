This book first came out in 1994 and despite beating a path to bookstore doors for the release of Ms. Crusie's last 4 books...I was caught unaware by this one. But, I snagged it off a shelf, brought it home and couldn't stop reading once I had started it. Phone calls went unanswered, dog went unfed and frankly, I'm not sure if I remembered to feed myself!  <br />A more unlikely couple would be hard to find then Lucy, a wacky, recently divorced teacher looking for some changes in her life, and Zack...a cop that feels his age weighing heavily on his tall muscular body, even though he's only 36. The verbal exchanges they put each other through are some of the funniest I've read and that includes Jennifer Crusie's more recent offerings. This book is a delightful experience of laugh-out-loud, foot stomping, eye watering exercises. Along with the hysterically zany moments, we're awarded some of the most enduring, red-hot steamy romantic displays between Lucy and Zack that rivial anything I've read. This book is a whoop and a keeper!	2001-11-08

At the same time she's being seduced by the wealthy, handsome Conner Stratford, her life begins to take on frightening, life threatening tones that are connected to Conners powerful family. While Conners brother Stephen is being seemingly sucked in by powerful political ploys beyond his control his wife and son are tossed into a sea of danger.<br />The reader is caught up in the intense attraction between Julia and Conner that burns up the pages as the threat to the Stanford family deepens then erupts, with Julia caught up in the crossfire. <br />The story doesn't unravel either gently or quietly but rockets the reader into a fast paced thrill as the sexual tension between Julia and Conner quickly unfolds and the intrigue and suspense explodes. A must read for Kane fans and especially for readers who needs a break from frothy novels! You'll love this one.	2001-11-05

Back away and do not pick up this book...and I can't emphasize this enough...do not pick up this book if you have anything pressing to do. This most recent novel of Cherry Adair's should come with a warning lable because once you have it in hand and start reading you can forget about getting anything else done until you have read through to the last page.<br />The opening sentence sits the stage for the red hot, explosive relationship between sedate Delanie Eastman and sensual Kyle. They are surprised to meet up with each other 4 years after a very brief breathless sensational episode that left each misunderstanding the intentions of the other. The firey attraction they were broadsided by initially is still in place, but this time, if unleashed, it could cost them their lives. <br />There's nothing this book doesn't have. The author has somehow taken every emotion known to man and meshed with a riveting plot, dynamic adventures and dramatic conclusion yet doesn't leave you feeling the whole package was 'overkill'. A lot of readers are going to be chomping on their bookshelves waiting for Ms. Adair's next book to hit the stands. I'll be one of the first in line.	2001-10-16

One has to get past their hopeful expectations that the book Garwood fans have been anxiously awaiting would be a tightly woven sequel to HEARTBREAKER. It does bring Theo Buchanan, brother of Nick from HEARTBREAKER into the limelight of a storyline that I personally found a bit less riviting then it's predecessor, but still well written in the way one expects of Ms. Garwood. <br />Michelle Renard, raised alone by her Louisana father when her mother suffers a stroke while giving birth to her, has a brillant mind that pulls her from life in a small bayou town into the life of a surgeon. The circumstances that take her from that of an uncultured girl to that of a beautiful, refined doctor are described powerfully and weave her involvement with Theo, an attorney, into an enthralling storyline. For an author that made the switch from medieval romance to contemporary suspense-laden romantic novels, Garwood barely misses a beat in such a dramatic switch in style and content. She may surprise, but she never disappoints. But, I'm still hoping that Noah from HEARTBREAKER eventually finds himself positioned as a main character in a future Garwood mystery!	2001-09-14

Take &quot;Cricket&quot; Stewart, the feisty, hard-headed, independent daughter of Rip Stewart, a Texas rancher and pair her with Jarrett Creed, a feisty, hard-headed, independent Texas Ranger and this book crackles with fireworks on almost every page! Initially I didn't think I was going to care for the rebellious Cricket as a romantic interest for the handsome Ranger because she seemed spoiled in a childlike way, talked rough and even turned into a once a month drunk to quell the pains her monthly cycle brought on. Somehow I didn't see how she'd ever turn into a woman that Creed would be interested in. But, as the story progressed and her interest in the Ranger increased, a gentle, less abrasive heroine begins to take form. Before long she's a perfect match in this tender yet still explosive romance with the dynamic Texas Ranger. I understand that this is the first in the BITTERCREEK series that will include Crickets sisters Sloan and Bay. FRONTIER WOMAN gives enough information about both these women in the storyline to give strong clues that these two women are also going to make for interesting reading. I'm looking forward to their stories as well.	2001-08-27

Hope Spencer, a tabloid writer from California romps into the town of Gospel, Idaho, with plans to spend 6 months getting her brain cells properly aligned in order to create the stories she's known for. The minute her \\"to die\\" for body slithers  out of her silver Porsche, she's creating a lot more then she bargained for. The attention she generates spans lusty stares and futile fantasies from the men and more then a few wistful looks and nasty jealousy from the women. Some of the shenanigans that dog Hope are just plain hilarious.<br />Enter the town Sheriff, Dylan Taber....one of those tall, dark and 'good enough to eat with a spoon' uniformed hunks that make most women smile at just the sound of his voice. However, he has avoided having a relationships with any of the local women since his wife left him and their son Adam. He's a great dad that wouldn't dream of taking a woman home with less then honorable intentions because of his son. However, the effect Hope has on his nerve endings is enough to bring him out of his monk like existence and leave him with ideas that definitely are not honorable where she's concerned! The two of them send off enough sparks to light up the whole town of Gospel.<br />Ms. Gibson, as always injects plenty of laughs, believable characters and breath-holding, lip-biting, steamy [...] in a wonderful tale. The wait for each new books she writes can seem like an eternity, but all four have been worth it.	2001-08-06

When Sophie Beckett is offered the opportunity to sneak into the very same masquerade ball her stepmother and two stepsisters are attending, she arrives decked out in a beautiful, glittering gown that belonged to her fathers mother with matching demi-mask. She not only has to keep her identity hidden from the stepmother that hates her but, also from the handsome Benedict Bridgerton who immediately succumes to her charms even though he doesn't know who she is or what she looks like. Even though she feels a strange magical pull of her heart with her handsome dance partner, she knows she has to leave by midnight. She flees, leaving Benedict to spend months searching for the spectacular beauty that has woven a spell around him as no other woman has. <br />Circumstances eventually bring Sophie and Benedict together once again. She has the benefit of knowing who he is and wonders at the effect he still has on her. He doesn't know that the servant he ends up rescuing from a dire situation is the woman he has spent the last several years dreaming about. Ones pulse would seem to throb and the heart clip at a rather fast rate when these two are together on the same page of the book; their chemistry is that hot!<br />Sophie and Benedict are a delightful couple and I hope that Ms. Quinn finds a place for them in a future book. I haven't read the other books in this series but, I'm hoping they're as spell-binding as AN OFFER FROM A GENTLEMAN has been.	2001-08-02

Casey Jones may seem a  little more rawboned then other female heroines, but she has the humor of a Stephanie Plum (albeit a little dryer) and men seem to see through her tough as nails aura and lust after the sexy persona that seeps through her &quot;don't mess with me&quot; attitude. <br />She moves into the home of Helen Pugh, the victim of a horrible rape that has been so traumatized she can't make herself leave the home she has shares with an eccentric mother. Casey vows that the man who ruined Helen's life will not get off scott free for the second time. Thus opens up a chilling flood of incidents that are brought to fore of women that have met with the same horrific crime as Helen, but did not survive the attacks. Casey sets herself up in a gutsy charade in hopes of bringing an end to the monster that has robbed her client of living a normal life. In the process, Casey's sleuthing almost brings an end to her own life. <br />This intense, suspense filled book was impossible to put down and was even more impossible (for me) to guess the outcome. Some mysteries tend to get thin and become anti-climatic near the end. This one was was a 'kicker' until the very last page. Thought I had it figured out. I was wrong. I didn't realize when I bought this book that it was part of a series. Thankfully it didn't harm the plot of the story or give less of a clue into the troop of characters by not reading the first in the series. What a great find this book was!	2001-07-31

Personally, I think that's a good thing. True....TEMPTATION is an excellent book. So is WOMEN. They're very dissimilar, thank heavens. Frankly, I get tired of the &quot;cookie cutter&quot; characters when an author finds a format that's selling and refuses to stray from it. Crusie gets edgy and isn't afraid to break away from the pack and FAST WOMEN reflects that break.<br />Nell Dysart has been dumped by her husband of 22 years and with the help of her two sister-in-laws, is groping for a new life. Due to a few twist and laughable turns she finds herself working for a couple of detectives in their antiquated office that she immediately decides to update,(the office, not the detectives) but not before she has innocently managed to create even more damage.  By the time she has made changes in the office she has also dug through the tough shield that the #1 detective, Gabe McKenna has shrouded himself in. <br />Crusie developed a novel that is pure feel-good entertainment and serves up plenty of opportunities to laugh out loud. As an added bonus the reader gets to try and figure out the mystery that is brewing throughout the book. It's not heavy reading, but who wants that on lazy hot summer days? If I want to dig into WAR AND PEACE again, I'll save that for those long, dreary winter months. Until then, I'll grab every Crusie book as fast as she can turn them out.	2001-07-26

The title alludes to a list of assets that Jaine Bright and her 3 best friends have decided the perfect man must possess. Some of the contributions to the list are serious but some are just thrown in for fun and the result of a few drinks and the bawdy moment they're having. However, the list leaks out and instantly causes notoriety for the four fun-loving women involved. Some people take it with the light-hearted fun that it was intended for; others find it insulting and sexiest. So the four find themselves either being cheered or spurned because of the list. But, one person reacts with murderous rage and the plot is set as Jaine and her friends realize the innocent list they created has put their lives in danger. <br />The nail-biting suspense is balanced out with the quick, off-beat humor of Jaine and the sexy presense of her next door neighbor, Detective  Sam Donovan.  With all the ingredients for good story telling that Linda Howard employs in MR. PERFECT, she comes up with the, uhhhhh......perfect story. This book should have come with a warning though: Once started, you may not be able to put it down until the last page.	2001-07-04

Most of us are so conditioned to reading and hearing about love &amp; lust for the 35 and younger hero/heroine that it doesn't even occured to us that love can be breathlessly exciting when the lovers are old enough to order off the senior citizens menu. <br />This lighthearted tale of divorced Julie Roth and widowed Romeo Cacciamani throws a light on how ardent an intelligent,  good looking couple can be at age 60. Their growing love is portrayed by Ms. Ray, with as much depth and excitement as any romance that could be shared by a couple of 30 year olds. They respond to each other with all the hunger they feel and the need their hearts have been empty of for several years while fighting their way through interferring family members who try to keep them apart because of a family feud that has lasted for generations. <br />This was a truly captivating summer read that I devoured in one setting. I think Jeanne Ray is an author we're going to hear a lot about in the future and I'll be happy to say I was able to buy her first book in it's first printing. Now, if only she'll soon come out with another one!	2001-07-03

How do they avoid falling head over heels for one another when they can't even be around each other for more then 5 seconds without wanting to tear clothes off of each other?  The chemistry is so hot between these two,  I advise only reading this book if you have a spray bottle of cold water near at hand and are prepared to cool yourself down with it. I enjoyed this book so much, that once I started it I didn't put it down except to eat and refill my spray bottle. I would love to see these two characters pop up in future books of Ms. Norths.

How is that girl ever going to decide between the two of them when both are so wonderfully male and magnificent? Then of course there's Grandma Mazur at her zany best and an estwhile little known family member makes an appearance. Stephanies &quot;perfect&quot; sister Valerie whose &quot;perfect&quot; marriage has bit the dust, leaving her to contemplate the possible advantages to becoming gay. Lots of laughs are evoked through her decision to make lifestyle changes while living with her and Stephanies parents. Mother Plum is menopausal and frustrated, Father Plum is trying desperately to stay in his own world and ignore the chaos around him and Grandma is, as always, looking to be where the action is! Throw in Bob the dog, and those pharmaceutically impaired space cadets, Mooner &amp; Dougie and it's once again madcap insanity from page one to the last page.<br />I don't know if I agree that this book is not as well written as the previous 6. I know I laughed just as hard and if it were possible to give any Evanovich book more then 5 stars I'd do it....just for the laugh factor alone! You can't read a Stephanie Plum book and not walk around with a silly grin on your face for two days after you've completed reading it. If you know anyone that's depressed, give them a Janet Evanovich book to read. Doesn't matter which one....they're all excellent for a lot of chuckles!	2001-06-21

As a Natalie Wood fan of the first order, I've found it hard to understand the lack of biographies offered on this international super star. One book by her sister Lana years ago, but felt that one may have had a one-sided slant because she obviously worshipped her well known sibling. Another biography years ago on Natalie and RJ, the man she married twice, seemed to be a bit sugar coated in detailing the hollywood dream couples life. But, this book hits all her peaks and valley's, her sometimes tenacious hold on reality and all the grit along with the glitter that made up Natalie Woods life until it ended at the age of 43 in a controversial drowning accident.<br />The author obviously did her homework if her account of how many of Natalies close friends and acquaintances she interviewed is accurate. She gives us, the readers, information that as far as I know hasn't been offered up before, and I think I've read almost everything ever printed about Natalie. <br />Ms. Finstad, the author paints a picture of a powerhouse superstar that has her fame and fortune balanced out by great loneliness, insecurities, and sometimes overwhelming unhappiness. However, we get a strong image of a woman that despite living her life in a fishbowl as a beautiful, rich and famous movie star, was actually quite earthy, likeable and eager to help others. <br />I was so wrapped up in this book I finished it in one day, figuring laundry can always wait. But, the laundry may have to build up a wee bit higher because I think I'm going to start reading this book all over again just because I enjoyed it so much. &quot;Natasha&quot; was definitely worth the wait!	2001-06-19

Another plot placed in England in the early 19th century that has been done to death.&quot;  Wrong! It could easily have been just another story of a poor peasant girl meets and falls in love with the local Earl....except Ms. Martin doesn't write anything just like anyone else. The peasant girl, Ariel, made a bargain with the Earl of Greville if he would send her to school so she could learn both academics and the fine art of being a lady when not to the manor born. By the time she graduates, the elderly Earl has passed on and his son, the handsome but cold-hearted Justin Ross is ready to collect on the bargain that was cast between the previous Earl and Ariel. She on the other hand has already made plans to renege on the arrangement. So begins a wonderful story of two people at opposite ends of the caste system that meet on the common ground known as love. They don't arrive at it easily, but once they do, sparks fly in the special way Ms. Martin has of making romantic scenes come alive and leaving you more then a little breathless!  Oh, and as a special bonus....I understand there's a sequel to look forward to involving Justins friend, the handsome but slightly mysterious Clayton and Ariels spirtited friend Kassandra. This will be quite a twosome and I'm eagerly awaiting RESTLESS!	2001-06-10

I'm glad I did because I enjoyed reading it and will probably be reading more books by Mr. Gorman.<br />The anti-hero of GHOST TOWN, Bryce Lamont has been released from prison and has journeyed to a town in Wisconsin in search of his old partner in crime because he never got his cut of the money from their last job because Bryce was caught and served time. He finds Jed, his old friend is now an upstanding citizen and owns the bank. Between Bryce's instincts and suspious matters happening in town, he knows something  big is going on and Jed's hand is the one stirring things up and Bryce keeps landing in the stirred pot. But, can he prove the respected bank owner is not who he appears? While all the turmoil is going on, Bryce finds the lady doctor of the town is stirring a few things up as well.....like, his feelings for her. <br />I like the way the story is told in the first person mode and without all the old western cliche`s I expected. The humor, the suspense and a touch of romance were blended just right for a very enjoyable read. I may be ready for another western saga or two!	2001-06-06

Even though it's easy enough to follow the story line if read out of sequence, I think reading this one first gives the reader a little bit better insight into the secondary characters...and glorious characters they are! Janet Evanovich is the only other author that comes to mind with the ability to interweave a good mystery along with a heroine with interesting but flawed looks, and a mouth like Phyllis Diller (she even THINKS funny!). Throw in a hunky hero that's in law inforcement who looks just like________ (fill in the blank with your personal favorite action hero). Top off with another hero that is a bit off-beat.

Top off with a group of elderly, pot-smoking matrons wanting to help our heroine &amp; hero solve the mystery and you have all the ingredients for a ton of laughs, some breath-holding moments and a hot romance that keeps getting hotter.

They may remain in your memory long after you've read another 20 books or so, but we're actually supposed to be basically involved with the heroine, Hannah Garvey...the resident manager of Valhalla Springs and our hero, Sheriff David Hendrickson.

As a lifelong fan of Ol' Ern I was excited to finally find a bio on the most famous pea picker of them all. Despite my love of the man as a performer I was aware that not only was he one of the most beloved entertainers, he did have vices. His drinking being the most noted. However, it seems that any blemishes in his character were passed over and the author takes a stand in her admiration of him that seems to be mostly aimed at keeping his remaining family members happy.  Betty Ford, his first wife was known to be a strong extenstion of his life, but where were the details and his feelings about her passing? Why was his will made out to favor his last wife of 2 years over his 2 adult sons? Why was so little said about Ernie's death?  He was the subject of this book, but he was alive on one page and gone on the next, and I,  as a reader and fan felt deprived of having an opportunity to grieve for the man.  I didn't want or expect a glossed over account of Ernie Ford's life, but that's what I came away from this book with. <br />I truly hope one day someone will write a novel about this wonderfully remarkable, talented man...present him  warts and all and allow us to see more then one dimension of one of countries finest baritones and untouchable as a gospel singer. But, most of all a man that had some terrible moments in life but still gave pleasure to thousands of people. That's the Tennessee Ernie Ford I want to read about	2001-04-09

Loved the first two in this series, &quot;The Hostage&quot; and &quot;The Mistress&quot;, and this, the third and final novel in the group I believe is my personal favorite. Hated to see the last page come up in each book in this triology of events that began with the castastrophic Chicago fire of 1871. <br />&quot;The Fire Brand&quot; is the name of the bookstore that the unconventional, independent Lucy Hathaway opens after the fire has taken the life of her father and his assets, leaving her mother and herself almost destitute. The bookstore is not only her livelihood but her dream of making her own way in life. Despite what the fire took from her, it gave her something she never expected to have in life. A baby literally fell into her arms! During the fire as she was trying to get herself to safety, she happened to look up toward a window in a burning hotel in time to see a bundle dropped from the window just before that floor was engulfed in flames. The bundle of securely tied pillows and blankets held a baby in the core of what was obviously meant to be protective wrapping for the infant. Unable to find the parents of the child, she took her into her home, her heart and raised her with all the love a child could have.<br />Five years later fate brings Lucy, her child and Rand Higgins, the natural father of rumbunctious 5 year old Maggie  together and leaves a nest of confusion for all concerned in their attempt to resolve who will raise the adorable, precocious little girl. <br />Life has been difficult for both Lucy and Rand, and with quite a bit of conflict involved in their attempts to come to an agreeable solution that will keep both of them involved in Maggie's life they find more happiness then they ever thought possible. <br />Suan Wiggs is a master at combining history with fiction and an extra large helping of romance together for a spectacular read!  I wish there were more novels to look forward to in this series.	2001-04-06

Would love to see them appear in another tale as enjoyable, exciting and rousing as this one. Absolutely, positively the best book I've read in the past year! I don't think Cherry Adair is going to be able to write fast enough to appease all her many new fans she's accumulated since &quot;Kiss and Tell&quot; hit the book stands. So, I'll patiently twiddle my toes and read some books that may capture my attention even half as much while waiting. If you haven't read this book, you'll want to get it now and plan on letting your work pile up while you're reading it, because once started.....you won't be able to put it down!	2001-04-05

Take a sexy, macho, steel willed Texas Ranger and pair with a pretty, free thinking, ahead-of-her-time feminist, throw them together and what you have is one dynamic duo! In the second book of Millie Criswells series (&quot;Desperate&quot; was the first), she has Ethan Bodine in search of his brother Rafe who is wanted on a murder charge. Ethan loves his brother, but being a Ranger to the very depths of his soul, he knows he has to bring him in. He meets up with a female bounty hunter with the unlikely nickname of &quot;Willy&quot; who is just as determined as Ethan to find the fugitive. She's not an experienced bounty hunter, she's just badly in need of money and finds the possiblity of bringing Rafe Bodine back and collecting the reward as a perfect solution to her problems. <br />Ethan regards Willy as a loose cannon and since he's concerned for both her safety and Rafes safety if she actually does get within bounty hunting distance of him, he lets her tag along with him in the search. Naturally, because of their combustible natures....it's almost lust at first sight. Their adventures together are hairy and their attraction to each other is red-hot! <br />I think I liked this book even better then the first in this trilogy (&quot;Defiant&quot; is the third and last book.) It was difficult not to devour this reading all in one setting. It's a great journey the reader takes with Ethan and Willy.	2001-03-30

However, after marrying his childhood friend Ellie, he quit rangering to settle down to be a proper family man for Ellie and the child they're expecting. But, he returns home one day to find his expectant wife has been murdered and even in his grief, instantly realizes the deed was done by a crazed criminal that he had once arrested and his loathsome relatives known as the Slaughter Gang.<br />Rafe sets out to avenge his wife's death and along the way is put in a position of coming to the aid of Emmaline St. Joseph, an heiress from Boston on her way to California with 5 orphaned children. The storyline quickly heats up as Rafe tries to stay detached from the strong willed redhead and the enchanting children who look to him for help. Aiding them will slow down his search for the men he's hunting. His principals as a man, his skills as a Texas Ranger, and his rage at the savage murder of his family are put to the test as he directs his energies into helping the children and the socialite. <br />&quot;Desperate&quot; won't win any litary awards; the theme isn't that much different then dozens of other westerns....but, it is plain entertaining reading that is hard to put down. For this reason I gave it 5 stars.....because it held my interest from start to finish.	2001-03-25

Actually, when Tess Haviland is handed a deed instead of a check for payment of design work she does for a rich, arrogant, disliked client in the form of a run-down, lakeshore home, she's unprepared for more then  fixing up an old carriage house. What she gets is a historical house with an interesting background and next door neighbors that consist of a Adam, a handsome widower with a 6 year old enchanting daughter, and Harl, the Vietnam vet and former police officer with a crusty exterior that hides a marshmellow heart. Those are the pluses. On the minus side, she has rumors of ghost in her house and a skeleton that is here one minute and gone the next in her cellar. <br />Ms. Neggers weaves a story of mystery and suspense around the compelling characters she writes about. The outcome was fairly predictable, but an interesting read from start to finish. I loved this book!	2001-03-12

Granted, Ms. Cameron is an excellent writer, but I personally felt she used her talent rather sparingly in this venture. I was more then halfway through before I started to feel like it wasn't a chore reading this book. Maybe it was because I simply found it so improbable that a 28 year old spinster in the early 1800's would consider having sex only to procur a baby. Somehow, the ghost that makes an appearance regularly throughout the book seemed more believable. Come to think of it, I think the comments of the ghost, Septimus Spivey, is what kept me slogging along to the end. He was very entertaining! Despite my lack of enthusiasm for this particular book, I still wouldn't hesitate to pick up another Stella Cameron novel.	2001-03-09

Bio's I generally keep around for &quot;light&quot; reading to fill in those breaks when other books get to heavy. However, this well done tome written by Lee Server kept my attention from the introduction to the epilog. Of course, being a life-long fan of Mitchum may have had something to do my diligent enthusiasm for sticking with it while dust settled around me. <br />The author obviously dug deep in his research because he offers much information I don't think was generally known about Mitchum. His long marriage, which had to be a great trial to his long-suffering wife Dorothy,  was exposed in a different tenor then anything else I've read on the couple. He brings out a soft, compassionate side to the crusty, vulgar macho man one generally hasn't been exposed to. Mitchum have been one of the few actors who worked with Marilyn Monroe that was understanding of her tardiness and outward vanity that covered a very vunerable woman with low self-esteem. Yet, he wasn't afraid to take on the &quot;big guys&quot;....the directors and producers while endeavoring to protect those that were intimidated by the &quot;fat cats&quot;. He stood up for his convictions and remained honorable to those he cared about. To the end he was his image...Robert Mitchum; tough guy. He probably never had a clue how highly he was thought of because to him, he was just doing a job that as he put it, a dog, &quot;Rin Tin Tin&quot; was in the same profession! He tossed out one-liners that years from now will probably be well known cliches. I always respected him as an actor....now, I also respect him as a man. Hollywood lost their last great actor from the glory days.	2001-03-02

The only problem I have with any Susan Elizabeth Phillips book is that I always start feeling overly anxious the nearer I get to the ending. I just hate to finish any SEP book, and I dreaded the end of this one more then ususal. I've finished this knowing I'll have start about 12 books before I find another one to grab my attention....unless it happens to be another SEP book! Anytime one of the Chicago Stars football team members is the hunky hero, I know the story is going to get torrid. One can count on the heroine to cause him to be fanning himself a lot, she'll be fanning herself! It gets hot for everyone involved including the reader. &quot;This Heart of Mine&quot; is no exception. Molly Somerville has a habit of falling into trouble, both intentionally an unintentionally. However, she doesn't plan on falling for Kevin Tucker, the current Stars quarterback. Falling for her is furthest thing from his mind. But, fall they both do...big time!  The story  also has a nice side romance involving Lili, Kevins gorgeous, actress mother and Liam, a surly artist. Great characters, great read. Now, the difficult part. Waiting on SEP to come out with her next book!	2001-03-01

I was only part way through this book...which was only the second Wiggs book I've read....and I ran out and bought every other SW book I could find. She has quickly climbed up my list of favorite authors till she's very near the top. In &quot;The You I Never Knew&quot;, she takes the reader through the heart wrenching separation of Sam and Michelle as teens, leads us through their unsatisfing lives until fate in the form of her dying father brings them together again seventeen years later. Can they recapture the magic they once had when they have an extra element in their relationship they didn't have before? The &quot;element&quot; is the son Michelle raised without Sam ever being aware he was a father. Wiggs weaves a fascinating story about how lives can take twist and turns and still start and end with one ingredient still in place. Love. She's a master at concocting a fabulous story with that ingredient.	2001-02-19

Kathleen Bridget O'Leary doesn't just weave a fantasy in her mind....she works to make her dreams come true. However, even in the best of her dreams she never conjured up any man as dashing, good looking, or as captivating as Dylan Kennedy. He surpasses everything she ever expected or dreamed of in giving her heart over to a man. However, there are a few little problems with this wonderful rogue. He has made an art of lying and he doesn't know what love is. Kate has her work cut out for her as she struggles to not only survive the great Chicago fire of 1871 and its aftermath, but to also prove to Dylan that love does exist. <br />I haven't been so totally immersed in a book or loved the characters like I have those in &quot;The Mistress in a very long time. This is the first novel by Susan Wiggs I've read and she immediately climbed to the top of my list of favorite authors. So, if you have this book....curl up and enjoy!	2001-01-31

This was my first experience at reading a Mary Daheim book but, certainly not my last. It was a riotious read that kept me guessing to the very end (and then I was wrong about who did what to whom). Judith and Renie may not have the most conventional methods of getting to the bottom of the case, however, they have the brains plus pure dumb luck on their side. They're both a hoot and an easy read! Now I'm off to find another Daheim book for my reading pleasure.	2001-01-28

She's delightful.....which I was optomistic she would be since the book has a great endorsement from none other than Janet Evanovich, the queen of one liners and sexual tension between the sexes.  The only thing I had a hard time grasping is how anyone.... even if it is Dan Dallagher, the heart stopping hero, could hate Italian food! I didn't know it was possible to turn ones nose up at cannoli. Anyway, back to the subject of this book, it's funny, romantic and just a wee bit off kilter compared to your average leading character with a riotious Italian family. I loved the characters and can't wait to get my hands on another Millie Criswell book.	2001-01-24

I have not read a book with a western theme that I've so thoroughly enjoyed in many years. In fact, this is the first story I've read by Ms. Lovelace, thanks to a friend loaning it to me. Now that I'm a fan, I'll definitely be on the lookout for all the other books she's had published. Loved the history she wove in through out the book about the Dakota Territory, and the special attention to detail in the treatment of the Sioux Indians during this period. This is a book I'll want to hold on to for a second read!	2001-01-19

For instance...what brought the physical side of love her mother dished out to old dad to a halt? Okay, so maybe she told more then we really wanted to know, but just goes to show she was pretty open about her fathers life. I found it surprising that she downplays her own personal life so much although she deals openly with her feelings toward her father. One thing she doesn't downplay even one iota is the rather venomous feelings she harbored for her stepmother, Barbara Sinatra. If her accounting of Barbaras behavior is accurate, she definitely had plenty of reason to dislike &amp; distrust the woman.  I personally tend to believe the wicked stepmom is just as she portrayed her because Tina is very kind in her recollections of her other 2 stepmothers, Ava and Mia. Somehow I came away with the feeling  this book was written not only as a tribute to her father,  but also as a means of publicly debunking the image Barbara Sinatra had carefully projected throughout her marriage to Frank.  Her written treatment of her father is probably a little biased and too gentle considering what is generally known about the man. But, it is her father so what can one expect? Overall, a very good read that I would recommend.	2001-01-03

You get the feeling Cybill Shepherd has never told a lie in her whole life  because she's just so darn open, honest and has a delightful &quot;shoot  from the lip&quot; quality, even if it shines a bad light on her. Not  everyone likes her, but you sure can't fault her directness unless you're  one that can't handle that sort of candor. Myself...I thinks she's the  Menopausal Madam of the Millennium...because she covers that topic with the  same frankness as she does her rating of lovers! If you're looking for a  milquetoast type of lady, Cybil isn't for you. But, if you want an  in-your-face peri-prima donna full of whirlwind nastiness and southern  charm, then you'll enjoy the heck of of Cybill! I had to skip around the  book instead of reading it in an orderly fashion because I just couldn't  wait to see what she did with some of my favorite actors. She does plenty!   Better read then the run-of-the-mill movie star bios. Enjoyed this book  enough to go back for seconds!	2000-09-09

He set a standard in his day that I'm  sure many talk show host have aspired to, but frankly I can't think of  anyone that did it as well as he did. Unfortunately, his book doesn't  &quot;show&quot; how strong his connection to his guest and audience really  was. I have my memory to serve me, but many of the readers probably weren't  around during Mr. Douglas' heyday and don't know how unique he was. For  example...he was one of the few greats that did something rather unusal. He  listened! He offered his guest the opportunity to have the spotlight on  themselves instead of constantly trying to catch the beam himself...which  sadly is what so many of todays host do. Perhaps someone else could have  captured Mike Douglas a little better then Mike Douglas did. His modesty  may have tainted the outcome somewhat. But, it's still a better than normal  read for a biography.	2000-09-09

The visual I got  from her description of Mat lingers on (sigh!) and it was easy to see how  our heroine &amp; First Lady, Nealy,  got weak in the knees at the sight of  him, but hard to understand how she was able to reject him for so long.   First Lady or Crazy Lady?<br />You have to cheer for the grittiness of Lucy,  the 14 year old who desperately wants &amp; needs a family and you want to  find a infant to cuddle like baby-girl, Button. <br />Ones intelligence  quotient may not escalate while reading this novel, but your feel-good  factor will soar!	2000-09-08

But, I threw my spirit through the looking glass with Keighly &amp; Darby and didn't come back until the last page was read. <br />Wonderful  story, wonderful characters, wonderful read. Pure entertainment from page  one through the final paragraph. Now I'm off to find another Linda Lael  Miller book to read!	2000-07-26

I believe Hannah is one of the best romance writers around today. &quot;If You Believe&quot; is the 3rd book by Kristin Hannah I've read in the past 2 weeks and she climbed to the top of my favorites list with the first one I  read, &quot;Mystic Lake&quot;. <br />Hannah wrings every emotion out of you by  the time you've completed the last page. Her characters, Mad Dog, Mariah,  Rass &amp; Jake spring to life and draw you right into the pages of the  book to experience their happiness, pain, love and tears with them. <br />So,  go forth and read. If you aren't already grabbing up each Kristin Hannah  book you can, you soon will be!	2000-07-22

Patti Berg is becoming one of my favorite authors after only reading two of her books; &quot;Wife For A Night&quot; and now &quot;Looking For a Hero&quot;. Couldn't put it down until I had finished it even though I had  laundry screaming to be done!<br />&quot;Looking For A Hero&quot; is one of  the few books I would read more then once. Morgan Farrel, aka Blackheart,  is one of the sexiest hero's to hit the pages of any romance book! I would  love to see this wonderful author bring Morgan and Kate back in another  novel....it would be a surefire best seller before it was even on the store  shelves!	2000-07-17

The best that can be said about Eddie Fisher is that he's great at selling himself as ever  the victim in his infamous marriages. The worst of Fisher is the way he has  used these marriages, affairs and one-night-stands to promote interest in  reading about his life, and I confess; I'm a person that has bought his  books only to get the dish on Debbie, Liz,Connie,Ann-Margret and a host of  other ladies he claims were crazy about him. Why? Apparently I have a  weakness for books written by kiss &amp; tell has beens. Hope I've learned  my lesson and avoid buying the next book he comes out with detailing his  life with the same characters and little variation. On second thought, if  enough people buy this book, resulting in enough sales to pad Fishers bank  account maybe he'll spare the world at large by not penning another  Debbie-Eddie-Liz memoir.<br />He barely touches on his relationship with his  four children; Carrie &amp; Todd by Reynolds, Joely and Tricia Leigh by  Stevens, outside of acknowledging he wasn't a good father. Major  understatement! <br />If you've never heard of the author or the principal  players in &quot;Been There, Done That&quot;, it may make for an  interesting read for you. However, for anyone that remembers the  headlines...you may as well save your money.	2000-07-11

Kristin Hannah's characters come alive because they are so flawed, fragile and fascinating! This wonderful book grabbed my attention from the first  chapter when Selena attempts suicide and all the quirky turn of events  leading up to the final chapter. The book slowed down somewhat in the  middle, but continue reading because the pace picks up again and keeps you  engrossed to the final page. Selenas battered soul comes alive when she  falls in love with Ian, the physician who saves her....but, he has demons  of the heart he has to struggle with before learning from her what love is.  Their fight for love is so intense and heartfelt you'll feel that no two  people ever loved more deeply then Selena &amp; Ian.	2000-05-18

Picked up this book on a fluke; have never read anything by her, normally don't even like mysteries no way, no how.  This one hooked me from the first page and held me to the last. I'm on a  quest to read everything else she's wrote.	1999-10-08

Her descriptions of New Orleans, homes and even the shops are so vivid one can truly live in each moment along with Mary MacAlistair, the lively character  the story evolves around.  Her life takes so many twist and turns it's  amazing to realize that it all happens in the space of a year.  From the  age of sixteen to seventeen she's experienced more then most would over the  space of a lifetime. She jaunts through the adversity in her life with a  very uplifting attitude until she briefly determines it's a dog-eat-dog  world she resides in.  However, events unfold and she again finds the 'chin  up' frame of mind that has made her the delightful character that is Mary.   I enjoyed this book as much or more as &quot;Charleston&quot; and  &quot;Leaving Charleston&quot;.  I did feel that the ending unfurled a bit  to quickly and lacked the build up that other important parts of the book  offered.  Overall, it was a most enjoyable read and I highly recommend it.	1999-10-04
