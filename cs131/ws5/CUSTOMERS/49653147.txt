Non-Christian revolutionaries hated Jews as well, and Rose details their reasons by analyzing the political opinions of various Romantic/German philosophers of the 18th, 19th Centuries.  He covers Kant, Hegel, Voltaire, Fichte, Marx, and ends with Wagner, and shows the intellectual development of revolutionary anti-semitism through these philosophers.  Some are well-known, like the aforementioned ideologues, others are lesser known.  The book shows the development of an anti-Semitic mythology, that began as a Christian anti-Semitism (the Ahasverus-Wandering Jew, Moloch and Mammon), yet by the beginning of the 20th Century, was a fully Secularized anti-semitism.<br /><br />The important lesson from this book is how entrenched Jew hatred was across the German intellectual landscape in the 19th Century.  It wasn't limited to a bunch of Capitalist Christians (as accused by many Marxist historians, who would no doubt be ashamed that their hero Marx hated Judaism), but atheists and socialists as well.  A good companion book to this is \\"Scientific Origins of National Socialism\\", about Ernst Haeckel and the Monist League, and how the German scientists caved into Jew-hatred as well.	2004-11-22
US	49653147	R2FHKKN6I4MH1U	0553580531	409245980	Gates of Fire: An Epic Novel of the Battle of Thermopylae	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Excellent	The strength of this novel is the poignancy of the characters, their relationships, the dialogue, the personal moments.  It has some good, hectic war scenes, but I will remember most the relationship between the lead character, the slave Xeones, and his cousin Diomache, I will remember the typical epic speeches and monologues by the Spartan leaders prior to Thermopylae.  For a historical war novel, this is one of the better ones I've read when it comes to human interaction. <br /> <br />There are only two weaknesses that hamper the book.  1.) it bogs a bit in the middle, as some of the characters start to blend together.  The character *moments* are strong, but some of the elder Spartans at least run together a bit until the final chapters.  And 2.) The historical reality of Sparta vs. Persia was hardly as noble and heroic as presented in legend and in this book.  As fiction, it's no problem.  But Sparta was one of the worst, most tyrannical cultures in the history of humanity--there is very little to valorize in Spartan culture.  I can understand and appreciate how the story of the 300 captivates the imaginations of generation after generation--it's one of the best legends of Western European history--but the Spartans were hardly fans of liberty and freedom, their own freedom or the freedom of others. <br /> <br />Still a great read though.	2004-10-08

It's only 180 pages or so, but it's an excellent reference book on your shelf the next time some numbskull lazily hurls around the \\"Nazi\\" label against any political ideology he or she opposes.  Very well documented and researched.<br /><br />This book describes the origins of National Socialist thought (the \\"Volk\\" movement), and its connections to Darwinism, evolution, and nature worship. The author does an excellent job at the connecting the dots between Ernst Haeckel's evolutionary Monism and Hitler's philosophy.  This should be read by all, because the evil ideology of National Socialism is irresponsibly misrepresented in pop culture as a capitalistic, Christian enterprise, when nothing could be further from the truth.  An excellent companion to \\"Nazi Economics\\" by Barkai, another good myth-buster.<br /><br />It's kind of scary how little people know about the intellectual origins of Nazism, how it's glossed over by professors and \\"intellectuals\\" who find that the skeletal backbone of National Socialism hits a little too close to home.	2004-10-03

Sheffield wants you to get your science right, he wants substance to your verisimilitude, and that's a good thing. <br /> <br />It covers the types of rockets that are possible, where alien life is possible, new forms of energy, quantum physics, non-locality, robotics and A.I...ect. <br /> <br />There are some weaknesses.  His explanation of Chaos Theory wasn't very helpful, and seemed unfocused.  The idea of solar powered energy stations hovering in orbit (or near orbit) above the earth, beaming radiation down to earth seems a bit fanciful for an author who is trying to \\"keep it real\\".  How healthy would it be for the environment if a power station beams down a nation's worth of electromagnetic radiation through clouds, the ozone layer, ect.  If a butterfly's wings can cause a tsunami (re: Chaos theory), what in the world would a LASER beaming to the earth do?!?  It's an attractive proposition--very attractive, quasi-free energy, but flawed, and really shouldn't pass the \\"hard SF\\" test.  Also, the chapters on A.I. and robotics were a bit too short.  <br /> <br />This is a good summary and a way to get your foot in the door to understanding these near-future topics, but to really master these topics for your writing, like Sheffield will want you to do, you'll need to dig deeper into these subjects in other sources.	2004-09-30

No. <br /> <br />The book starts off w/ a fairly creepy and original premise--a thunderstorm is sucking people into the wall so that they become two dimensional shadow creatures haunting a skyscraper.   <br /> <br />It starts off w/ this.  It doesn't end w/ this. <br /> <br />By the end, it's a typical Lovecraftian horror monster slasher tale, w/ a rather cheesy supervillain w/ a redundant and predictable psychosis.  The original premise is forsaken in favor of same old same old.  I bought this book because of the originality of the premise, so I guess I'm disappointed.  The story begins to break down w/ the confusing explanation of the phenomenon.  It seems like there may be some fascinating pseudo-science behind it, but it's just all over the place in its speculative fiction. <br /> <br />The characters are mediocre and typical--the tragic character, the redemption character, the New Age chick, the power-mongering human who predictably becomes evil incarnate (Heaven forbid these authors shake things up, how about the person who becomes the conduit for evil incarnate be the tragic character?  Or the redemption character, who thinks he can harness the evil energy for good?).  The other secondary characters are indiscernable, and its hard to keep track of the characters getting butchered. <br /> <br />There are some creepy moments 150 pages in, but 350 pages in, it's anticlimactic.	2004-09-04

It provides a strong argument that the Nazis did not originally plan to exterminate the Jews in Europe, but rather export them from Germany.  Browning's thesis is a challenge to the slippery slope fallacy, which suggests that just because a person steps a foot in one direction doesn't mean he'll step a mile.  The Nazis clearly started out w/ a 'Final Solution' plan of sending the Jews to a place like Madagascar (which was on the table as late as the Battle of Britain), but after the invasion of Russia this 'Final Solution' snowballed into a landslide of killing Jews via gas chambers (not that the Anti-Semitic rhetoric of the early 30s were justified in any way, whether pro-genocide or pro-expulsion).  The Nazis took a step in a bad direction, and then they walked a mile along that evil path. This would give logicians a nightmare. <br /> <br />Most people assume that Hitler ran on a genocide program in 33.  This is a dangerous assumption, for two reasons: 1.) it tends to view the Nazis as a supernatural party of evil.  Make no mistake, the Nazis WERE evil, but they believed themselves to be do-gooders who provided solutions to the problems the average German faces.  Did the German people know what they were getting into in 1933?  Sure, they were willing to view Jews as the scapegoats for the Depression, but did they hate Jews enough to kill them?  This book challenges the \\"Hitler's Willing Executioners\\" theory, because although Hitler touted a Final Solution in Mein Kampf, that wasn't interpreted by him or his companions as outright genocide until 1941.   <br /> <br />And 2.) Holocaust deniers use this fact, that the \\"Final Solution\\" in the 30s meant population dispersal rather than genocide, and then they play the \\"Well, if you were lied to in high school about the original intentions of the Nazis, what else were you lied to about? (hint hint, you were lied to about the Holocaust period!)\\" card to gain confidence w/ the unsuspecting listener, and then convert this person into a Holocaust denier.  It is important that we know the facts about the Holocaust, so that the uninitiated in deep WWII history won't be hoodwinked w/ \\"gotcha\\" facts by Holocaust deniers.	2004-08-26
US	49653147	R36CS5UXV32XXB	0030270170	204807407	Principles of Macroeconomics	Books	5	4	5	N	N	One of the best Econ textbooks	I'd recommend this along w/ \\"The Economic Way of Thinking\\" by Heyne, as the two best Econ textbooks I've read.  Mankiw's book is fair and balanced, he is not a frothing at the mouth partisan, and it is a straightforward explanation of basic economic terms.  However, he establishes a handful of core truths that anyone who wishes to understand economics must accept, and if not accept, explain as to why these certain truths don't apply.  For example, Mankiw establishes that 1.) free markets work better than regulated markets, 2.) private property and incentives are necessary for productivity 3.) trade makes everyone wealthier.<br /><br />He does not explain these in a polemical way, but he calmly establishes a solid case for these (and other principles), and despite being fairly standard in economic circles, they are fairly contentious in the realm of political economics and discourse (particularly on the collegiete level, where English Major Marxists think they know more about the social order than those who study the social order).  This makes the book more persuasive than a fire and brimstone screed from an Ann Coulter type.  Books like this need to be read by all to improve the Economical I.Q. of the voting public.	2004-08-23

That is the book's strength, a solid summary on the negatives of public ownership and the liberty that flows from private property. \\"Where private property is nonexistent, selfishness has free reign.\\"   <br /> <br />If there is a negative, it is that the book jumps around a bit.  There are other books that I think do as good of a job (if not better stylistically) of addressing the failures of socialism (Re: Heaven on Earth by Muravchik) and there are other books that provide a positive prescription for world poverty via private property (Mystery of Capital by DeSoto).   This book straddles those two, overlaps them, and thus is a fine companion piece.	2004-08-23

I'm scanning over the first couple of pages of my paperback copy of Riverwatch, and I'm reading these positive reviews by authors and newspapers, and I'm thinking...there must have been some mistake by the publishing house, and the reviews of RiverDANCE got mixed in w/ the reviews of Riverwatch, and being that I find Riverdance insufferable, I can safely say that Riverdance is \\"Nasty, vicious, and perhaps most insidious of all, seductive\\" (to quote the blurb on the cover by the Midwest Book Review), in comparison to Riverwatch.  I would rather watch a five hour documentary about Michael Flatley's toe fungus than watch a 90 minute film adaptation of this book. There HAS to be a mistake w/ all these positive reviews...<br /><br />Why is it so bad?  Well, it isn't so much bad as it is groaningly repetitive and unoriginal.  I guess a bad book is one w/ plotholes the size of a galaxy, nonexistent climaxes, and childish grammar mistakes.  This isn't bad that way, this is bad as in you've read every single sentence that is in this book before in some other book.  Every piece of dialogue is lifted from an 80s horror flick or one of the bad episodes of the X-Files, like \\"Let's end this\\" or \\"Die, damn you, die!\\"  Oddly enough I was yelling the same thing, but I was yelling it at the nondescript, everyman characters, who you WANT to see get eaten.  These are nobodies, distinguished only by their job or their pets or the timing of their bravery.  The italicized POV thoughts of the characters merely repeat what was narrated before, or they are stupid and generic thoughts that no one thinks in a flight or fight situation.  The author does the incredible job of creating lowest-common denominator characters who are also paradoxically distant from the audience due to the cliched and \\"all-too-aware-that-its-a-horror-book\\" narration.  Was this book meant for teenagers?  Only people younger than 15 could find anything fresh in this book, yet its too gory and potty-mouthed for kids.  A previous reviewer says that you'll groan alot reading this book.  That's an understatement.  You'll groan more often than a cow giving birth to octuplets in a 48 hour labor.  This book just reads like a rough draft, no tightening of the narrative, no specification of the characters, no ding-dong on the cliche-o-meter that forces the author to brainstorm a different scenario or conversation between his characters.<br /><br />The speculative fiction concepts are a cross between Lovecraft and Graham Hancock, with no new spin.  The old good race, conveniently humanoid, that helped man build the Pyramids, vs. the old evil race, conveniently demonic, who eat people.  Conveniently, only one of each race remains.  Because of course, a story about two frozen-in-time antediluvian warring races being reawakened by mankind, and the two ancient forces renew their epic battle over the earth, indifferent to the destruction they rue upon modern civilization, w/ mankind having to defend its own existence to either the indifferent \\"angels\\" or ravenously hostile \\"demons\\", that's too ambitious and it's not cliched enough. Read Mountains of Madness instead of this.  Moloch's a pretty nasty deity, to whom the Canaanites sacrificed their children in burnt offerings.  Child sacrifice is what makes the beast so scary and horrifying--this is gutted early in the novel.<br /><br />I can only recommend this book to two people, 1.) people who have been in a coma for 70 years, and have not read H.P. Lovecraft or seen a single movie ever and 2.) parents who have proto-goth teenagers who want to be \\"kewl\\" and hip to their teen's interests while encouraging them to read, so you get them a horror book that is rated R, but lacks the depth and storytelling of a Harry Potter book.reviewer says that you'll groan alot reading this book.

Post-WWI Germany was a mess, and Left-wing Revolutionaries (the Spartacists) were causing problems in Bavaria, on the coast.  Enter the Freikorps, voluntary soldiers used by the Gov't to prevent violent Revolution w/ even more violence.  The Freikorps at times instigated the violence, in order to provoke a Communist response and use that response as justification for a more brutal one.  One of the fascinating aspects of this book is how Germany could have gone Bolshevik in the wake of WWI, maybe if the Left had better leadership.  The Freikorps, according to Jones, set the pavement for the Nazi takeover of Germany.  Many Freikorps did become members of the Nazi party, and they shared common nationalistic and anti-communist values.   This book covers a 5 year period, from the end of the War to the Beer Hall Putsch in 23.  At times the history is almost too specific and we have hour-by-the-hour recounts of Right vs. Left standoffs.   <br /> <br />I'm not sure its safe to call the Freikorp the \\"birth\\" of the Nazis.  The Nazis pulled on various strains of German tradition for their ideology.  \\"Blood and Soil\\" is only mentioned in passing, as is the Volk movement (see \\"The Logic of Evil\\" by Brustein).  Which came first, the skeletal Nazi organizational structure seen in the Freikorps, or the Nazi ideological echoes found in German past?  I think the title is a bit misleading, and if an author wanted to address the \\"Birth\\" of the Nazis, he'd have to go back to Haeckel and the Monist League, as the relationship between man and nature is intrical to the Nazi worldview.  See books such as \\"The Scientific Origins of National Socialism\\" by Gasman and \\"Blood and Soil\\" by Bramwell.  One thing I credit Jones w/, is he addresses Nietszche and his impact on the proto-Nazis.  There has been a concerted effort on the part of English and Phil professors to save Nietszche from Nazism, and Jones will have none of that.<br /> <br />Nonetheless, this is a good solid history of that chaotic and dangerous five year period in Germany's past that set the table for Hitler's eventual rise to dictatorship.	2004-08-06

This is NOT an introduction.  Concepts and words are introduced, loosely defined, and left to the reader to research.  If I recall, he doesn't even address the Five Pillars of Islam, and he skips the development of Christianity, and narry a mention of Constantine and his indirect impact on the Mideast (Constantinople, the Concil of Nicea that led to the isolation of Rome from Mid-east Christianity...although Lewis obviously addresses the Byzantine empire).  To a college freshmen, this book would go over his head.  That's not to say it shouldn't be read, eventually, it should--but go elsewhere first and then let Lewis put it all together for you. His emphasis seems to be the crest of Islamic history, from its humble beginnings to its artistic and cultural achievements during the Baghdad era to its economic/scientific stagnation and cultural battle w/ the West today.  Also, it's over ten years old, ends w/ the Jordan-Israeli peace agreement, and sorely needs an update considering what has happened since Rabin's assassination. <br /> <br />The opening chapters are the most strongest, and Lewis brings insights into the development of Islam that even the most seasoned layman historian has overlooked.  His analysis of pre-Islam Arabia, its economy and imperial conflict, is first rate.  The cross sections in the middle of the book about Ottoman Gov't and the Ulemma are for the more serious students.  The modern-history chapters are weaker only because they move by so quickly and so much gets left out.  This is a book everyone should eventually read, but don't burden yourself w/ it until you have a mastery of the basics.	2004-08-05

In this book and in &quot;Mapping the Mind&quot;, Carter tends to side w/ the deterministic interpretation of human behavior. She outlines her reasons for thinking so--namely, the dissonance between our consciousness and reality (we are aware of phenomena 1/2 second passed their occurence) and the infamous Libet's experiment--but there is evidence that the brain's neurons CAN adapt and reform new networks, what is called neuroplasticity. Jeffrey Schwartz' book &quot;The Mind and The Brain&quot; proves that there is a &quot;Will&quot;, a &quot;Mind&quot;, that can choose to change the way the &quot;Brain&quot; interprets the world. See that book for its proofs on neuroplasticity. <br />  <br /> This book neglects to mention the arguments in favor of neuroplasticity, so it is incomplete. Nonetheless, this book does serve a purpose--it gives a good overview of most of the theories of consciousness, it outlines the purposes of the regions of the brain (a good dose of neuroscience never hurt anyone, although Mapping the Mind is more in depth in this area), and it offers the arguments and evidence in favor of determinism. I think it is recommended on those merits, although maybe not at the list price. I read it via the library, but I could go for it for less than 10 bucks. This is a good book for any college student, the layman psychologist, the layman philosopher, the know-it-all wannabe who shows of his knowledge to get chicks, and the science fiction writer who emphasizes the soft sciences.	2004-08-01

If you want character development, this book's for you.  If you want mind-blowing creativity from a writer who will take you through a strange new science fiction society, this book's for you.  If you want the literary allusions and metaphors, this book's for you.  To me, the joy of the novel is the inventiveness of Bester's mind--who can forget the Martian colonists who seek to find enlightenment by severing their sensory cortex and becoming only memory? <br /> <br />Although rough in some areas--it was written in the 50s and isn't PC or even pleasant in some areas--this book basically invented the existential anti-hero for the science fiction age in the form of Gully Foyle. Bester picked the character of Gully from Camus' brain.  But Bester doesn't leave Foyle wallowing in the pit of nihilism.  Structured around the Count of Monte Christo, yet w/ a nastier protagonist, the story comes to be about more than revenge, but rebirth, or birth period.  The novel begins in a dank, broken down ship reaking of death, and ends w/ new life, a new concept of life itself.  Now that's a journey.	2004-07-31

Nanotech is hazy--heat and Quantum Mechanics are a problem when it comes to moving individual atoms and their own lil subatomic particles around. I'm not convinced that Drexler solves the heat problem w/ division of labor, that's like saying someone who exercises for 30 minutes on the same workout won't sweat because he's only doing one thing--the energy and the exertion is still the there even if he cross-trains, doesn't disappear w/ repetitiveness. The heat problem is a big one, and the easiest for us to understand, as we may never fully understand Quantum Mechanics. Drexler claims QM doesn't affect atoms, only electrons. He's trying to view atoms as a whole instead of a sum of its parts. I know we've spelled IBM w/ atoms, changing the number of electrons and protons &quot;manually&quot; on a given atom is a different story *and* is subject to QM.  <br />  <br /> Nonetheless, these criticisms shouldn't deter oneself from the speculation, as the aforementioned problems very well may have solutions.

It is such an awesome concept, the type of concept many wannabe writers of so called speculation fiction dreams of: demons exist, there is a historical Satan, they live under the earth, they raid humans as slaves and torture others to death, thus creating a naturalistic hell--and humanity's going to invade this Hell. <br />  <br /> Well, it sounds like a really good Horror/Science Fiction/Philosophical War novel, and Long is virtuoso at times in executing this concept--the problem is, he backs out of it a third of the way through and instead starts to focus on what is at times a rather boring descent into the core of the earth and also rather weak and superficial philosophical/theological discussions that go nowhere profound. Only at the end of the novel does the story return to its promise, but then it feels too late, as the characters start to irritate more than relate. The first 100 pages and the second 100 pages work, the middle 350 don't. Chapters 1 and 3 are two of the best single chapters I have *ever* read. Claustrophobic, intense, scary. Why not go w/ it? You can't put down the book at first, but by the midpoint, you're just forcing yourself to get through it to find out what happens. <br />  <br /> This is where Long goes wrong--he starts to &quot;humanize&quot; the unhumanizable, he thinks he's being nuanced by playing up the hand of the &quot;Hadals&quot; (the aforementioned &quot;demons&quot;), by quite literally being the Devil's Advocate, but at the same time he props up a very un-nuanced, Manichean interpretation of human nature, politics, and ideology. The demons are &quot;noble savages&quot;, the real evil people are those corporations and armies! Brrrr! Monsters who want to rip out your eyes and torture you to death? They just need to have their ancient language understood and it's kumbaya time! But capitalists and Bible believing Christians? EEEEEVVVVIIIILLLLL. The protagonists are all anti-Catholic Catholics, who wear their hatred of the Church on their sleeve. If your politics are left of center, you will probably love this book, as it caters to your worldview and prejudices. It's the noble liberation theologians vs. the ignoble free-marketeers, w/ Satan and his misunderstood minions in between. <br />  <br /> The problem w/ this isn't about political preferences, it's just simplistic and counterproductive. This is a *horror* story, a *science fiction* story (at least it's decievingly set up to be), a story that relies on theological assumptions and allusions, and when the writer guts his juicy concept that swallows all these genres in favor of redundant and superficial philosophical conceits (the chapters on the &quot;Satan Seminar&quot;)...dang, it's just a waste of potential. Long jumps around in his novel, trying to tackle so many different subjects (linguistics, geology, evolutionary theory) that it's like he's showing off how smart he is. These insights are hardly profound, but are there more to make the novel &quot;seem&quot; more epic. His diatribe on the Shroud of Turin is just laughable, and really adds nothing to the story except to get something off the author's chest. W/ exception of a handful of key characters, the rest of the cast just kind of mesh together, inseparable in ideology (and we are the way we see the world), only differentiated by name. The motives of the Hadals and their leader aren't outlined in any provocative way, and the motives seem contradictory and stupid, especially after the big &quot;twist&quot; when the identity of Satan is revealed. <br />  <br /> A disappointment, but w/ so so so much potential.	2004-07-26

I like the ideas of Lovecraft and Shelley's Frankenstein is one of my favorite novels, I heard Stephen Laws was good so I went to the local used bookstores and searched for Darkfall, wasn't there, bought this and a couple of others. I say all this to clarify that I am no horror aficionado, and at this point I couldn't tell you what is considered &quot;A-List&quot; from personal experience relative to the horror genre.  <br />  <br /> This is a book about a vile beast (the title character, the Wyrm, which I guess is pronounced either &quot;Weerm&quot; or &quot;Vyrm&quot;) that emerges from w/in the earth after the sacred seal that secured the beast is broken. The protagonists are a broken down horror novelist, a shy young woman, and her father who has a secret regarding the Wyrm, plus a couple of kids and dogs and cops. The monster is blatantly Lovecraftian, which I liked, but the monster also talked too much, bragging about how horrifying and evil he is. That's sophmoric writing. The book has deformed zombies, Hellhounds, and a deadly fog. In other words, it takes villains from about 4 different 50s movies and combines them into one threat. <br />  <br /> At times the writing is inspired, particularly through some of the &quot;horror&quot; sequences, at times it's insipid and cheesy. &quot;He recoiled in terror&quot;...as opposed to recoiling in joy? At times the characterization hits the mark, at other times, it's cliched. At times the monster is creepy (particularly the final form), at other times it's like he's singing, &quot;I'm, too sexy for my decapitations, too sexy for my decapitations, so sexy it hurrrrtss....&quot; The first couple of attacks by the creature are a bit unnerving, but by the end...been there, seenthat. This is not a bad book, although it starts off a bit slowly (mind you, to develop the characters) and I imagine pretty standard fare for the horror genre. If you want to read a modernized, gory version of a Lovecraftian tale, w/ a slight Christian bent, this book would make an adequate read. <br />  <br /> If you're sensitive to doggies, I warn you, a doggie that you grow attached to gets killed in it.	2004-07-23

I think some of the reviewers are too harsh on the characterization, the characters are fine for this genre.  The story is about man vs. nature, man vs. himself, not man vs. man in battle.  This aspect of the novel is strong; the descriptions of the harrowing journey these troops make through snow, rain, rock clefts, torrential rivers (and the painful consequences of the journey) make for an exciting read.  This book is hard to put down.<br />However, when it's done, a couple of glaring weaknesses stand out--1.) the exciting prologue is misleading, and likewise confusing, and you expect this to involve the story in some way beyond character exposition.  One of the driving forces to get you to finish the book is to see how the opening ties in w/ the treck out of Babylon.  No such tie.  It's like a well written yet unrelated short story, a bait and switch.  2.) Ford's writing is at times thrilling and majestic, at other times, cliched and groaningly &quot;First Draft&quot;.  Phrases like, &quot;He recoiled in terror and awe&quot;, are peppered throughout the text.  and 3.) Some of the more interesting characters are dumped halfway through the novel.<br />Nonetheless, there are some excellent scenes in the novel (the training session(s), the Athenian father, the battles (especially involving the Rhodians), the denouement of Asteria) that justify the read.	2004-07-19

Electromag-ramjets, light-sails, Nuke powered, they're all here.  It's 15 years old, however, but it is nonetheless a good starting point to understand the possibilities of interstellar travel.  This book also covers the basic physics behind space propulsion.  The book is obviously a good resource for science fiction writers, futurists, and people who want to wow their friends w/ insightful comments on space colonization.  W/ the new Mars initiative by NASA, designed to be fulfilled w/in 50 years, maybe NASA might fulfill some of the theories outlined in this book.  Be ahead of the curve.	2004-07-18

The so called &quot;Million Idea Generator&quot; Matrix is probably the best one, with the Metaphor Maker close behind.  The book also contains some mind-bending/expanding exercises, visual illusions and word games to help you see beyond the obvious.  Better to get this book used or from a book club.	2004-07-18

In theory.<br />The universe is strange (thanks mostly to Quantum Mechanics).  The title of this book implies an analysis of how strange the universe can be in the borderlands of science.  However, if you want a book about how strange the universe *isn't*, than this book is for you.  The title is betrayed by the tame speculations and interpretations of concepts that are better outlined in entry-level astronomy textbooks (like WIMPs and black holes).  Siegfried's conclusions emphasize how unified and harmonic the universe is, how in sync the universe is w/ our math.  That's fine, that's reasonable, it's also bait and switch.  If you want an unprovocative book, get this.  I expected a cutting-edge, substantive analysis of the &quot;strange matters&quot; out there, like dark matter, &quot;cosmic fluid&quot;, string theory--an analysis that is unafraid to balance what we do know w/ what is possible.  What I got was science for Victorian tea-sippers, biographies of the likes of Einstein (that's all fine and good...for books about EINSTEIN, this is a book about STRANGE MATTERS), and groaningly lame cultural references (that are allegedly, jokes).  Behold, the first popular science book that has a footnote on Nancy Kerrigan!  I really wanted an indepth and comprehensive analysis of dark matter, I didn't get it.<br />Also, I found Siegfried's writing uninspired and confusing, and I'm someone who has a basic understanding of the material.  I don't know how much use it would be to someone who has just heard of the photoelectric effect and gluons.  Of course, the bad jokes make you want to skip a couple of paragraphs and you get lost.  I'd recommend &quot;Borderlands of Science&quot; by Sheffield instead as the text that fullfills the promise of &quot;Strange Matters&quot; title and subtitle.  Also the works of Greene and Gribbin for string theory and black holes.  &quot;The Universe Next Door&quot; by Chown, a book I haven't read, also looks promising.  Skip this unless you've had a serious deficit of Nancy Kerrigan references in your life.	2004-07-16
US	49653147	R25ITRA1UTIDH0	0915815435	427386527	Before Jerusalem Fell: Dating the Book of Revelation	Books	4	39	63	N	N	Gentry's evidence near conclusive	Book of Revelation was written in 64 AD and most of the events took place during the reign of Nero and the seige of Jerusalem.  This book goes a long way to prove those assertions and validate the &quot;preterist&quot; interpretation of Revelation.<br />If there is a flaw in this book, and in preterism, it is the &quot;Replacement Theology&quot; and borderline (if not outright) Anti-Semitic overtures promoted by the preterist interpretation.  Preterists tend to assume that Preterism and Replacement Theology are mutually inclusive.  Revelation is not about the end of THE age but the end of AN age, the Age of Judaism.  This is a half truth, and, following the advice of Paul, discernment is required.  It is the end of the TEMPLE Age, the end of the Sadduccees and the Herodians and the other Judeans (the Greek word for Jew is Youdaos, and it also means Judean...the Judeans were not symbolic of the whole race).  *If* Revelation was about God's revenge against those who crucified Jesus, and all the Jews are implicated in this blood libel, then God failed, because Judaism prospered relative to the number of its adherents(in spite of persecution) for 2000 years after these events.  God either failed, or God's wrath was directed at a specific group of Jews, the corrupt priestly class of the Sadduccees, the &quot;Judeans&quot;.<br />The Pharisee Jews and the Jewish Christians were closely related.  They shared the same root, the humanistic school of Hillel.  Hillel said &quot;Those things that are hateful unto you, do not do unto others.&quot;  Jesus embellished this ethic w/ the Golden Rule, &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&quot;  The Hillelians conflicted w/ the ultra-conservative school of Shammai, and one of the insults the Hillelians hurled at the Shammaians, was that the Shammaians were false Jews, members of a &quot;synagogue of Satan&quot;.  Conveniently, this same vernacular is used in Revelation by Jesus himself.  During the Roman persecutionof the Christians, it was the Pharisees who stood up for the Christian Jews, who protested the murder of James, heck back in the books of Acts, it was Gamaliel who defended the Apostles before the Sanhedrin.<br />Paul asked us to be respectful of the root that sustains us, the seed of Abraham.  Christianity and diaspora Judaism share the same root--the Pharisee School of Hillel.  It was Rabbi Ben Zakkai, a Hillelian Pharisee, who miraculously escaped from the seige of Jerusalem and built a school to keep the Jewish traditions alive while Christianity veered ever more to the Gentiles.  I recommend the book &quot;The Mystery of Romans&quot;, by Mark Nanos, because Nanos refutes Replacement Theology w/ his analysis of Romans the same way that Gentry refutes Futurism w/ this book.  Like Gentry, Nanos uses textual, historical, and archaeological evidence to slam his thesis down.  Other books dealing w/ the Jewishness of early Christianity, are &quot;Yeshua: Guide to the Original Church&quot;, &quot;Our Father Abraham&quot;, and &quot;They Loved the Torah.&quot;  Modern Christian culture dumps a false choice in our laps:  either Replacement Theology Preterism or Futuristic Dispensationalism.  They are both only half right.	2004-07-15

He then carries the reader through the traditional economic concepts of Supply and Demand, Specialized Labor, Externalities...all focused through the lens of the &quot;Economic Way of Thinking&quot;.<br />Make no mistake--this book is a substantive, philosophical refutation of &quot;Statism&quot;.  Heyne hits Comparative Advantage, Price Theory, Rule of Law, and Private Property hard (in the affirmative), and if you're for tariffs, regulated prices, arbitrary Gov't intervention, and public property, your views won't be validated.  All the more reason for you to read this book, and understand why so many stamp their foot down against politicized economic policies that superficially sound and feel so good.  Heyne's lesson is to think on a macro-scale, think about the unintended consequences of mass social change, for that is the Economic Way of Thinking.	2004-07-13

If you need this proven to you, if you're skeptical of the skeptics, you should read this book w/ an open mind.  Many environmentalists are sincere--however, many are members of a &quot;secular&quot; cult, reverse-evangelicals, who have a God (Mother Nature), a Devil (Man), prophets (Ehrlich, Nader), demons (Capitalists), a way of salvation (Green Socialism), and a nightmare Armageddon (when Nature takes her vengeance on man's greed).  The former, the reasonable people should read this book, because they can be persuaded by Lomborg's most important thesis:  that the solution to whatever environmental problems we face, will come from economic growth, not anti-industrialism, anti-globalization.  <br />The Kyoto Treaty is not the solution, but would actually exacerbate the problem of Global Warming by restraining technological development and human employment.  You want a worldwide Great Depression, put the Kyoto Treaty in practice, and then see if mankind has the collective resources to find alternative sources of fuel or, heck, build new air conditioners.  Lomborg shows that as the economy grows, so does environmental problems like pollution reduce.<br />He also shows that the warming and cooling of the Earth is cyclical, possibly (or probably) tied to Sunspots.  At the end of the Medieval Period, the earth was as warm as it is now (possibly warmer), and 1400-1900 the Earth was in a mini-Ice Age.  London had worse pollution in 1700 than today.  I guess you could say that the internal combustion engine is so metaphysically evil, so powerful, that it's vile emissions travelled back in time to warm the earth around 1300 and to pollute London in 1700.  But more likely, the .6% increase in worldwide temperature since 1900 is the result of the workings of the solar system and not evil, vile technology.	2004-07-13

A man building his own coffin is,&quot; this is one of the examples of wisdom in Monica Wood's book.  Much of this material is common sense, if you think about it, but Wood puts it into words that help us think through our own thoughts.  She asks us to focus our descriptive style through character, and relate how the scenes and settings impact the characters or are how they are interpreted by the characters.  Make the metaphors and adjectives character inspired, not author inspired.<br />She organizes her book around chapters that deal w/ Description in relation to Dialogue, Forward Motion, Point of View, ect, so this would be a handy resource to pull off the shelf if you are stuck in any given scene, and you want advice for better ways to convey the characters and to move the plot.  She gives examples of good description and bad description, and if you're like me, you'll cringe reading the bad examples because they look so familair in my own writing.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is I would have liked to have seen more descriptive examples from different genres, instead of incessant &quot;modern-era Great American novel&quot; type of prose.  Some addenums on science fiction, fantasy, horror, mystery, historical fiction, would have helped.	2004-07-12

Whether you're an IDist or a Darwinist, this is a good book to have on the shelf just as a reference point.<br />A lot of people on both sides just talk pass each other, and project their image of the &quot;other&quot; side the way they wish to see it.  When Darwinists think of Intelligent Design, they think of 7-Day Creationists who want to burn scientists at the stake.  When 7-Day Creationists think of evolution, they think of that athiest Joseph Stalin shoving Christians into Gulags (and Daniel Dennet apparently thinks religious people should be in cages, so maybe that assumption isn't very far off).<br />Behe's book is not about the Bible, or Christianity, or Creationism, or even anti-evolution.  It is anti-aimless natural selection.  Behe sets up many examples w/in biology and biochemistry that show how the human cell and its processes are dependent on complex plans that could not have developed gradually.  Blood coagulation requires &quot;knowledge&quot; of the end result in order for the process to begin.  The immune system requires separate parts to evolve at the same time to meet a common goal w/in the system.  There are &quot;blueprints&quot; w/in life that mutation and natural selection cannot explain, especially w/in the timeframe of earth's development.  Does this disprove evolution?  No.  Does it prove the existence of God?  No, not necessarily, although you'd have to provide a funky explanation involving (gasp! oh no!) metaphysics.  The Power of &quot;Life&quot; as the Grand Unified Theory of Physics, or something.  So this book does prove the need for a new explanation that is going to have to account for the borderline miraculous development of life, since life is so &quot;irreducibly complex&quot;.  Francis Crick, probably seeing the writing on the wall because of his analysis of DNA, jumped on the panspermia bandwagonearly on.  I always wondered why he did so, because in High School and College I was never told of the weaknesses w/in Darwinism, and here comes Crick w/ this funky idea of panspermia.  Why, I thought?  Crick's obviously a genius, wasn't he aware that natural selection is flawless and infallible?  Now I know why.  Of course, panspermia has its own problems, as it just pushes the problems of chaotic life ex nihilo back a couple of galaxies and epochs.  <br />Behe also shows how many of the arguments against Intelligent Design are Strawmen fallacies, such as &quot;Well, God wouldn't have done it that way!&quot;  Well, why not?  That's not an observation of nature, but a metaphysical argument, and one that comes from Sartrian &quot;bad faith&quot;.  Behe takes from the bottom up, and shows how the observation of cells and cellular mechanisms leads to planning and design.  The identity and characteristics of the Designer--is he perfectly Good or does he have a mean side, is he Deistic or Theistic, would he make the universe perfect from a human perspective or would he make the universe glaring w/ imperfections--is for another book and another time.  Like a good Belisarius (the Byzantine commmander who ushered in the strategy of defensive warfare), Behe merely stakes out a sound corner w/in science that orthodox scientific opinion cannot explain (irreducible complexity), and he sits there, secure.	2004-07-10

It is a good conversation starter and always thought provoking.<br />What disappoints me, however, is that he doesn't take a &quot;hinges&quot; of history approach to the concept.  In theory you can take this to the extreme--for example, who's more influential, Muhammed or the woman who gave birth to Muhammed?  However, there are key characters in world history who do not even make the &quot;near miss&quot; list, yet alone the Top 100.  <br />What about Themistocles, whose foresight in investing in an Athenian navy helped to save Athens from the Persian invasion?  No Themistocles, no Greek victory, no Greek hegemony, likely no Socrates, no Aristotle, no philosophy.  Or Scipio Africanus, who saved Rome from Hannibal by basically inventing the scorched earth military tactics and taking the battle to Carthage while Hannibal owned Italy.  Scipio was an original tactician.  No Scipio, no Roman conquest of Spain and North Africa, no doorway into Egypt and Palestine (and we know how important Roman influence is around 30 C.E. in Palestine), no Roman hegemony of the Meditareanian, no economic monopoly of Med trade, no Roman empire, thus no Ceasar, and possibly no Rome, period, as Hannibal probably could have destroyed Rome if not for Scipio's victories in Spain.  Or Woodrow Wilson, who got the U.S. into the first World War (and thus helped to win it), who helped to form the modern world as we know it, who helped to create the map of the Middle East which is giving us such headaches (not to mention Yugoslavia), who helped to craft the post-WWI world which directly contributed to WWII?  Or James Madison, who wrote the Constitution, a legal document that lawyers are still fighting over how to interpret the 1st, 2nd, 10th Ammendments?  No Constitution, duh, no United States.  He should be ranked ahead of Jefferson, not a &quot;near miss&quot;.  <br />Or Pope Gregory the Great, who basically formed the political role of the papacy in Europe for a 1000+ years.  No Attila the Hun? He played a critical role in empowering the papacy AND weakening the Roman empire.  Or Columbanus, who helped to keep European intellectualism from completely falling into barbarianism during the 7th/8th Centuries by building intellectually rigorous monasteries across the continent, planting the seeds for scholasticism, and thus, eventually, science (although it takes a couple of centuries).  Or Muawiya, who contributed to the split in Islam between Sunni and Shi'a, and we know how much impact *that* has had on world history, especially the past 25 years.  Or Emperor Meiji, who modernized Japan in the 19th Century?  In fact, Hart basically jumps from St. Paul to Guttenberg w/o mentioning anyone of note during the middle ages when the seeds of Modern Europe and Japan were planted (the G8 countries are all European in origin, except Japan and maybe Russia).  Mani? JFK?  Guy who invented birth control?  No, no, NO!  Kick them off the list, and pick any if not all of the aforementioned figures!<br />It will be interesting to see what an updated list would have.  Reagan would probably be listed higher, considering he transformed the U.S. economy and helped to defeat the USSR.  Ossama Bin Laden?  George Bush?  The person who defined Wahhabism?  David Ben Gurion?  Kemal Ataturk?  Watson and Crick?	2004-07-10

However, I will review it from a different perspective than a &quot;practical&quot; application manual in taking control of your life.<br />If you are a writer, or a struggling writer, a book like this can be an invaluable resource on day-to-day human psychology and interaction.  You can see situations, interactions, and even conversations develop for your characters based on Lieberman's insights and examples.  This book can potentially break writer's block, if you're stuck in a scene, you know what your characters want but don't know how to show it (a man coming off too strong to a woman, someone trying to break bad news to a loved one, someone wanting to manipulate a favor out of someone else, ect.), this book offers suggestions on how your characters should act, or more importantly, how they *shouldn't* act.  Since Lieberman's observations based on real life, learning and internalizing the positive and negative consequences of the behaviors described in this book can add some realism to your short stories or novels.<br />As for the lessons themselves, I now see how in many times in my life I have done the wrong thing, and this book explains why I just made things worse, like in past relationships, in job interviews...mistakes we have all probably made.  Beyond any practical applications, this is just a fascinating book for those who are interested in human interaction.	2004-07-10

It is not a chronological history of Sumer, so this book is more of a supplement to one's studies in ancient near east.  The book covers little known aspects of Sumerian culture, like education (\\"1st Apple polishing\\"), sex (\\"1st Sexual Symbolism\\") and possibly even pets (\\"1st Animal Fables\\", \\"1st Aquarium\\"), as well as the facets that are well known--Gilgamesh, Utnaptishtim, Sargon, ect. The key theme that arises from this book is how civilized the ancients were--these were not clueless barbarians roaming the Mesopotamian plains, they were not idiots, but thoughtful people who tried to make sense out of their (oftentimes chaotic) lot in life.  A good companion to the library of any ancient-history-ophile.	2004-07-09

It's history book gruel--not particularly insightful or engaging, but it gets the job done.  One of the strengths of the book is it is a general history of post-Hellenistic-to-Sadat Egypt.  An in-depth analysis of Coptic theology is missing from this book, and that's a bit disappointing.  The book tends to focus on the cultural role of Coptic Christians in Egyptian history, such as the influence in business inspite of persecution, poll-tax, and Nasserite socialism.  That's good to know, but again, not the stuff you'd look for when reading a book on Traditional Egyptian Christianity.	2004-07-09

A version of you woke up next to five lingerie models.  Another version of you woke up and butchered your loved ones.  Another version of you gets struck by lightening while reading this review.   <br />That, according to the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Physics.  This is the attempt of physicists to explain the fundamental weirdness and contradictoriness of subatomic particles--ie, the abilty of particles to transmit information across spacetime instantaneously (non-locality), the ability of particles to be in two places at once (wave fuction)...the author leans towards the Many Worlds Interpretation, the idea that the universe splits in two at every quantum choice or juncture whenever an observer observes particles(whatever a quantum choice is, and how often do these choices occur, and who is ability to collapse these wave functions into two+ universes from one, and if the human mind does this, then what collapses the wave functions that form the neurons and calcium ions that propel the neural functions that enable observation?, and can animals collapse wave functions (I've always wondered about Schrodinger's cat...if the poor cat can't observe his way out of his predicament, than how did the dinosaurs observe their way into theirs?)).  If the M.W. Interpretation is true, than there is probably an infinite amount of universes, which means that anything that can be, has been and will be.  Nonetheless, this is pretty fun stuff to think about, if you're a science geek or a philosophy geek or, like me, just a geek period.<br />The book begins when about a 40 page summary of Quantum Physics and its dilemmas, and then follows w/ a series of interviews w/ leading physicists on how to resolve these dilemmas.  When trying to understand Quantum Physics, you will need to expose yourself to many explanations and sources of the subject--everytime you read Quantum theory, it's like the first time, cause it's so dang weird.  This is a good book to have on your shelf toflesh out your understanding of this topic, and it's a topic we should all be aware of.	2004-07-09

He compares Sub-Saharan Africans as just a hair above dumb animals, and he slams Arabs and Bedouin in other ways.  However, his sections on economics and social politics are still valid, and he was a pioneer in areas that other Westerners tend to get credit for.<br />Before Adam Smith outlined the need for &quot;Specialized labor&quot; in a commercial society, there was Ibn Khaldun.  Khaldun wrote of the pivotal role of &quot;crafts&quot; and specialization of crafts in a functioning human society.  He even suggests that skills in crafts are limited, that is, if you're a master shoe-maker you in all likelihood won't be a master farmer.  Therefore, master shoe-makers should make as many shoes as they can and farmers should farm as they can, so as to produce as many goods between the two of them than if they shared their time doing both.  Before there was Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig Von Mises, Ibn Khaldun implied the need for Rule of Law.  Khaldun chastized the Bedouin who disrupted the social order through their raids, and sent the craftsmen packing.  Some sort of consistent legal standard and social order is needed to ensure that specialized labor has the ability to perform its &quot;crafts&quot;.  Before there was Reaganomics and Arthur Laffer, there was Ibn Khaldun.  You want more tax revenue?  Cut taxes, which provides incentive for people to work harder and expand their enterprises.  More business, more economic growth, more tax revenue.  High taxes deter enterprise and shrinks tax revenue.  Arthur Laffer?  Yes, but Ibn Khaldun 300+ years earlier.<br />The issue Khaldun is most known for is &quot;squadness&quot;, Group Feeling, Group Narcissism, Tribalism, whatever you wish to call it.  Governments and regimes come and go based on the strength of the leaders to appeal to group cohesion.  This could be religious, blood, nationalist, whatever, butregimes need ideological cohesion in order to survive.  Once that group feeling is lost, the regime becomes weak and conquerable if not self destructive.  Multiculturalism and Postmodernism would be signs of cultural disorder and eventual social crumbling to Ibn Khaldun.  Crane Brinton, Erich Fromm, Erik Hoffer all touched on the &quot;Group Feeling&quot; themes in their own works, in different ways and emphases, and in many ways did it better (they had more historical examples to pull from, since history has dramatically accelerated since Khaldun's time), nonetheless, Khaldun was the one who first articulated this concept of political and social (dis)order.	2004-07-07
US	49653147	RA3YH62KV5P59	0465003125	949106200	The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB	Books	4	8	13	N	N	Jumps around, but a good source nonetheless	Many of the assertions of this book have been revealed in other books, specifically those books dealing w/ the Venona taps.  It is a strong history of the KGB, and at times quite revealing--not only in regards to the activities of the KGB, but also the reactions by Red-leaning Westerners.  <br />The USSR viewed the West as the enemy from day One of its Revolution.  Lenin was more concerned about the American Relief workers--who were helping to end the Collectivist induced famine in Russia--being subversives, than he was concerned about the 5 million starving in his own country.  Stalin viewed the Russian Civil War as a template to interpret the rest of the world, the West were the \\"Whites\\" and they had to be defeated.  During the Nazi-Soviet pact, he was more suspicious of Churchill than he was of Hitler, and in fact interpreted rumors of Germany's \\"Barbarosa\\" as English Anti-Soviet Propaganda.  The USSR infiltrated the U.S. and U.K. governments, while the US and UK barely had spy agencies formed yet alone spies in the USSR.  If there is any book that shows who started the Cold War and who didn't want \\"Peaceful Coexistence\\" (hint, it was the Commies), it's this book.  <br />This is an excellent resource for parents to buy for their college age children, so that the youngsters have a resource to challenge their Anti-anti-Communist professors who are trying to indoctrinate the new students into the Che Guevarra T-shirt Club and ANSWER.  Other good books would be, of course, the Black Book of Communism, a Century of Violence in Soviet Russia, Gulag, the Soviet World of American Communism, and for economic theory challenges to collectivism, Road to Serfdom by Hayek and Socialism by Von Mises.  The historical revisisionism that preaches the decency of Communism and the USSR must be defeated.  The book covers the span of the KGB from its torture of enemies in the 20s to its infiltration phase in the 30s/40s to its propaganda phase in the 60s/70s(using fake letters to discredit anti-Commie personalities or to incite race-based riots) to its Afghanistan/Poland phase in the 80s.<br />One disturbing claim made in the book:  Mitrokin suggests that the KGB stored caches of weapons and bombs in the United States in case of domestic revolution.  Andrews only gives Mitrokin as the source.  What happened to these caches?  Were they removed in secret?  Did Yeltsin tip off the U.S. to their existence in abandoned warehouses or fields in Detroit, NYC, Memphis, wherever they are?  Are they still there?  If true, this is very very...not good.	2004-07-07
US	49653147	R2GAQW1TFVCSMD	0060393556	938605832	The Mind and the Brain: Neuroplasticity and the Power of Mental Force	Books	5	21	27	N	N	Nails in the coffin of determinism	Schwarz outlines scientific evidence of \\"neuroplasticity\\", the ability of the neurons in the brain to form new connections.  Neuroplasticity is the result of \\"Attentiveness\\", or Mental force, and in illustrating this concept, Schwarz clearly designates between the Mind and the Brain.  The Mind can change the Brain.  Schwarz ties neuroplasticity to quantum mechanics, and thus tries to create a Unified Theory of Consciousness.  This is an excellent book to challenge determinists (like Rita Carter) who insist that there is zero free will and we are entirely the result of biochemistry.  Schwarz uses examples of scientific and psychological experiments to prove his point--this is not just abstract philosophical argumentation like so many other \\"Brain-philosophers\\" getting published today.  The author addresses the infamous Libet experiment that apparently proved epiphenomenalism (the idea that consciousness has no casual impact on the brain, and the neurons work first before the mind \\"decides\\"), and this is one of the most important aspects of the book, as Libet's experiment is trotted out repeatedly to prove determinism.<br />However, Schwarz's free will is not idealized.  His interpretation of the mind is more like a sleepy sailor on a mini-sailboat.  The sailor is the mind, the boat is the brain, and the wind is nature.  If the sailor isn't alert, the wind will guide the boat wherever the wind takes it.  However, if the sailor is attentive, he can guide the boat however he wishes.  Focus and attention are necessities--when we act rashly or go w/ our immediate reaction, we are just being guided by the wind.  Schwarz is a Buddhist, but his conclusions can be applied to any philosophy or religion.  His more \\"weird\\" conclusions are the result of confronting the \\"weird\\" realities of Quantum Mechanics and non-locality.<br />If there are any weaknesses in the book, it's two: 1.) the middle section on the monkeys is unnecessary, repetitive, and disgusting.  He proves his point w/ human research, no need to bring this depressing garbage up of tortured monkeys, you can skip these chapters, and 2.) He is a little too hard on Descartes, as much modern day philosophers are.  Is not the division between Mind and Brain, between Quantum wave fluctuation and Newtonian particles, merely updated versions of Cartesian duality?  The lines may be blurred between the Mind of Volition and the Matter of classical physics, but they remain distinct on some level, if not in form than in purpose.  Schwarz's dualism is far more Cartesian than modern-day postermodernism or deterministic biochemistry.  \\"Cogito Ergo Sum\\" is reinforced by \\"Mindfull Attentiveness\\", not undermined.	2004-07-03

Padfield tries to explain Himmler's personality w/ psychology--the love-hate relationship w/ his father, the dissonance between Himmler's mind and reality, his sociopathic personality--which I think is merely overlooking the obvious:  Himmler had a vile worldview and he set about to fullfill that vision.  The psycho-analyzing is fine, I guess, but National Socialism was merely Himmler's new demonic religion after he renounced Christianity.<br />Padfield does a better job detailing Himmler's philosophy.  We are reminded that National Socialism did not begin w/ Hitler, but had its own roots in German Volk movements and national etatism.  If Hitler did not exist, Nazism probably still would have, as Himmler formed his racist thoughts independent of Hitler.  Padfield stays away from the weirder mystical sides of Himmler, but he does touch upon Himmler's fascination w/ eastern religion.  The book also reveals actions by Himmler that I didn't know before--such as two aborted betrayals of Hitler during the end of the War (Himmler knew of the assassination attempt on Hitler, and did nothing to stop it, and Himmler tried to secure a separate peace w/ the Allies).  To Himmler, loyalty to the beliefs of National Socialism trumped loyalty to Hitler.	2004-07-03

This is an excellent book about the Left's blindspot--either willfull or self-deluded--towards the atrocities of the Soviet Union and Communist movements in general.  Radosh begins in the late 30s early 40s--when Leftist attacked FDR as a war-mongerer during the Nazi-Soviet pact--and ends w/ Bianca Jagger strutting around nude during the anti-Sandinista Nicuaraguan elections in the late 80s.  The stories and anecdotes Radosh brings out are entertaining and in ways, frightening, because of the depth of the willful ignorance of Communist atrocities within the Leftist collective consciousness.  Michael Lerner, Bob Scheer, Ed Asner...these people still walk around w/ a hefty amount of credibility to the crowds they play to.  That's disturbing.  Radosh also returns to the Rosenberg case, and shows how the Venona taps confirm the guilt of the Rosenbergs.  He also tells of the Leftist reactions to this, either denial (like many reviewers below, many of which don't even address the consequences of the Venona \\"secrets\\") or worse, \\"The facts are irrelevant, we need the Rosenbergs as heroes\\".<br />I'm only giving it four stars, because I think that David Horowitz' Radical Son is a better overall biography (more personal and honest), and Horowitz explains the personal appeal of and rationale behind Leftism.  Radosh's book is more of a summary of Leftist vomit, like the above quote from the SDS, but it's still an excellent book about one side of the political spectrum during the Cold War.	2004-07-02

God, Satan, Maya, the Id, Drugs, Evolution, Communism, Religion, Postmodernism, the Future, Reality, Unreality...all of the above, none of the above?  What does Eldritch and his precious Chew-Z represent to you?<br />Dick's masterpiece about a creeping threat(or is it the salvation of man?) that is borderline supernatural feeds off the audience's paranoia of the \\"Other\\".  This is a common theme in PKD's work, and this may be his best on this topic.  We have no control over it, it's coming, to eat us, to savor us, to incorporate us into his mind.  I've always felt that PKD was in ways an heir to horror-master H.P. Lovecraft, another writer who wrote about the inevitability of man's annihilation at the hands of the supernatural.<br />I'm tempted to drop the rating a half star, because this book does tend to get repetitive towards the end, and possibly confusing if you're not paying attention, but that seems to always be PKD's point--the swarming of Palmer Eldritch in the characters' minds.  It works well as an idea, but, in execution, you kind of want the story to move along.  PKD's strength wasn't in his plotting or characterization (although this book has some of his better character arcs), but in his mind-blowing creativity.  Even his weakest books are a joy just because you run into concepts and ideas that you probably never could have thought of yourself.  Finding out what little mundane development PKD envisions for the future is as much as a page turner as the plot itself.  Evolution treatment, suitcase psychiatrists?   The normality of the weird, a PKD trademark.	2004-07-02

If you want that, you'll need to find another book, which Ellis probably authored. The focus of this book is more narrow, and cultural issues are set aside in favor of Roman-Celtic relations. Attention is given to the Celts and their alliance w/ Hannibal, the militarization of Roman society in response to the Celtic frontier, and of course Julius' quests to sieze Gaul and Britain.<br />We tend to think of the Celts as limited to Northeast Europe (ie Ireland), yet Ellis dispells this pop cultural myth and documents that the Celts were very prominent--and historically influential--in Iberia-Galacia, even Asia Minor.  The Galatians were the first Celts to accept Christianity, and Paul's epistle to them is one that greatly influenced early Christian relationship to Judaism and the Torah.  The book only lightly touches upon the Irish Celts, but this is still a good book for the Irish-ophile to learn more about the spread of the Celts across all of Europe.	2004-07-01

Everitt drops in nice tidbits of Roman life--shopping malls, insurance-arson scams, and Vestigial Virgin drag queens--but this biography lacks both A.) historical perspective and B.) philosophical perspective on Cicero.  Someone who knows little of Cicero before reading this book, would not know a whole more about Cicero's worldview.  We learn that he believed in the representative Republic, in some degree of personal freedom--but he also believed in deterministic, pantheistic Stoicism.  How could these be reconciled?  How is determinism and liberty compatible?  How is determinism and virtue compatible?  How could these beliefs impact the Founding Fathers?  This is what lacks from the book--why Cicero's beliefs led to his life, and why his life led to the Enlightenment.<br />This book nonetheless does it's basic job, and the portrayals of Cato, Pompey, Caesar, and Octavian are strong.  Cato comes off as the noble idealist--as Cicero would have seen him--and the emperors and would-be emperors come off as the practical power mongerers that they probably were.  Crassus and Cataline are like cartoonish villains, yet, by their idiotic deeds and schemes they might have been.  This would be a good book simply to flesh out one's knowledge of a time slowly being forgotten in the Postmodern West.	2004-06-30

The Irish monks recorded the classics, from Cicero to the Tain Bo Cuailnge, and after the barbarianization of the Roman empire, it was the Irish monks who kept the intellectual legacy of the West alive.  During the 6th and 7th Centuries, the Irish built monasteries throughout continental Europe, propogating their love of learning and books. According to Cahill, if not for the philosophical substance that the Irish brought to Europe, the Arab/Muslims would have swallowed Europe (I'm not so sure, it was Charles Martel who stopped the Muslims in 711, grandpappy of Charles the Great, and he was the Merovingian who enthusiastically brought the Irish to France).  <br />Nonetheless, Cahill creates an attractive interpretation of Irish Catholicism. St. Patrick is centuries, millenia ahead of his time -- sex is a private matter, women can have power in the church, slavery is evil, Christianity must adapt to the cultures, the universe is magical, Christianity must be intellectual, Christians can experience any form of fiction and appreciate it...so attractive is St. Patrick, that it seems a bit unrealistic.  We're not sure if St. Patrick was real.  I hope he was, and the stories and prayers about him are true, for the above reasons.  He's pretty darn cool.  <br />The descendant of Patrick, Columbanus (\\"Little dove\\"), was the one who toured Europe like Johnny Appleseed dropping intellectually rigorous monasteries all over the place.  However, in other sources, Columbanus is a rigorous and austere master. He does not fulfill the legacy of the laid-back \\"Are you down w/ G-O-D?\\" Patrick, which Cahill neglects to mention, and again reinforces that Cahill's sources and evidence is selective to fit the argument he wishes to make and the view of Christianity he wishes to promote (not that I disagree w/ it).  Clearly Christians should be more aware of the open-minded and intellectually-curious background of their own faith, given the impact Celtic Christianity had on Europe, as contrasted w/ the self-imposed ghettoization many modern American Christians sects have placed themselves in.<br />This is a good introduction to various aspects of Late Roman Empire/Celtic-Irish/Medieval Christianity, and it's an enjoyable read.  But keep in mind, the history is exaggerated a bit, no matter noble the thesis.	2004-06-29

It is basically a summary of all the wants of futurism--nanotechnology, AIs, quantum computers, holistic evolution.  But instead of finding these theories spread over numerous books, Kurzweil brings them all together as emanating from one conclusion:  evolution is increasing on its own order, and thus speeding up.  Our technology is a part of the evolutionary process, and should not be feared.<br />How realistic are these visions?  Foglets (nanotech clouds that can form and reshape into any object), scanning our brains into robots or computers so we can be immortal, quantum computers...Nanotech has some fundamental problems to work through, A.) how to dispose of heat and B.) that funky thing called quantum mechanics.  The brain is ludicrously complex (neurons have thousands of connections), and the notion of simply scanning it into a computer and having one's memories recreated inside a new robotic shell is a bit far fetched.  Neuroscience is still a hazy business, see The Undiscovered Mind and The Mind and the Brain (from different Points of View, the former Freudian, the latter a proponent of Free Will).  If our memories are no longer existent in the new shell, at least the memories as we remember them (I know this is getting into &quot;loaded question&quot; territory), does the self remain the same?  Is it the same &quot;person&quot;, a man of meat becomes a man of machine who remembers his &quot;old&quot; past differently?<br />Nonetheless, this is a worthwhile book on where humanity may be going to, and it would probably help give you some ideas if you're a wannabe science fiction writer.  You can also drop some of these concepts on your date and wow her w/ your insight and speculatory nature.<br />One complaint that I have about the book is I didn't care for all the quasi-conversations the author manufactures in the beginning of the latter chapters.  I started skipping them.	2004-06-28

Pearlstein's analysis is that narcissism plays a deciding factor in pushing the individual into terrorism.  The individual has some sort of negative experience that shatters his self esteem, the &quot;narcissistic injury&quot;, and this leads to &quot;narcissistic rage&quot; against a world that does not conform to his expectations.  Pearlstein analyzes 7 terrorists and he applies this system to all but one, Carlos the Jackal, who does not seem to fit the profile.  Many of the terrorists had bad childhoods, or bad marriages, or bad jobs, or all of the above, and each found a new, omnipotent ego in the Weathermen or Symbionese Liberation Army or East German Red Brigade (6 out of the 7 terrorists are Marxists).  These terrorists can find an easy rationalization in Marxism and 60s intellectualism, where Maoist pukes like Sartre rationalized terrorism as &quot;man recreating himself&quot;.<br />Can this apply to modern day radical Islamic terrorism?  Ossama Bin Laden had it pretty easy growing up.  The narcissism is the belief in the religion, the race, and w/ the mediocrity of the Arab-Islamic world in comparison to the West, we can see the &quot;group&quot; narcissistic injury that not only leads to individual terrorists taking the cause of the people on themselves (Ossama and Zarqawi and Sirhan Sirhan) but also groups of individuals giving financial and material support to the Al Qaedas and Hezbollahs of the world.  The narcissistic injury need not be individual, but also collective.	2004-06-28

However, Patai builds his case w/ his sources (original documents, linguistic inferences, and Arab psychologists), and he corroborates his conclusions w/ specific instances.  His strongest point is the description of the Honor-Shame cornerstone of Arab society, because he refers to the wires sent between Nasser and Hussein of Jordan -- Patai shows the need to &quot;save face&quot; in a historical context.  I also appreciated the sections on the Arabic language, these chapters fit in conventiently w/ much modern philosophy, the Lackoff and Johnson &quot;Philosophy of the Flesh&quot; types.  Other points are weaker (how entrenched is bedouin culture in urban Arab society?), but at least Patai sources his claims.<br />The accusations of racism are unfounded.  Racism is the belief that some people are genetically inferior to others.  Patai does not tie genetics to the culture.  There are good people from every culture, individuals superior to me or you.  &quot;Westernized&quot; Arabs are oftentimes very successful in the West, yet the Arab world as a whole has gotten poorer the last 20 years, and it ain't Israel or the U.S.'s fault, and it ain't imperialism's fault (quite the opposite--Arab socialism has been a disaster), and the Arab world owns a near monopoly of the world's cocaine--oil.  Patai outlines many of the cultural quirks that keep the Arab world from fullfilling its potential--the atemporality of the language, the overemotionalization of the language, the idealization of the past, the resistance to change, the honor found in exerting power...these are not &quot;racial&quot; issues, but cultural issues.<br />This book helps to explain the outrage over the U.S. goings on in Abu Ghraib, yet the silence over Saddam's dismemberings and &quot;Kill a Thousand prisoners today!&quot; mass executions in the same prison.	2004-06-27

He makes reference to the Nazis wanting to surrender to the Allies rather than the Soviets--um, did Hitler/Goebbels/Himmler surrender to *anyone*?  The nonideological soldiers, the middle men, they weren't the \\"true believers\\", the members of the mass movement who articulated the vision of the Third Reich, who invested their egos into the identity of National Socialism, went down w/ the ship.  The suicide rate amongst Germans at the end of WWII was higher than the suicide rate amongst Jews in the concentration camp.  Not everyone living under a tyrannical minority is a member of a mass movement, not everyone is a \\"true believer\\".  As Hoffer said so himself, \\"The game of history is usually played by the best and the worst over the heads of the majority in the middle.\\"  Yeah, the previous reviewer sure did read this book, didn't he!  <br />As for the interchangability between Nazis and Commies--it often happened, however it requires some amount of cognitive dissonance to trigger the change.  A traumatic event, or a revelation.  We see it often on the scale of American culture--David Horowitz and David Brock, Dennis Miller and Ariana Huffington, for example.  Fundamentalist Christians become militant atheists.  Militant atheists become fundamentalist Christians.<br />Hoffer's conclusion does not differ much from a LEFT wing psychoanalyst, Erich Fromm, who articulated similair views about tribalism as the result of individual narcissism sublimated into group narcissism.  They seem to be working on the same wavelength, at least when it comes to group think, group psychosis.  <br />\\"A man is likely to mind his own business when it was worth minding.  When it is not, he takes his mind off of his own meaningless affairs by minding other people's business.\\"<br />\\"Mass movements can rise and spread without the belief in God, but never without belief in a devil.\\"  Gee, what irrational side of the political spectrum does *that* describe? ABB?<br />\\"Those who find no difficulty in decieving themselves are easily decieved by others.\\"  <br />Hoffer is not perfect and he stretches on some points.  He also approaches mass movements from an amoral point of view--ie, if there was some group out there that miraculously had the truth w/ a capital T, whether divine or scientific in a Grand Unified Theory way, it would still be just like other mass movements preying on the same psychological weaknesses.  This book is about human nature and the tribal instinct, not specific moral values.  A masterpiece nonetheless, that dissects much of the current worldwide political climate.	2004-06-27

In doing so, he comes closer to putting us into the minds of Jewish Christians living in the 40s, 50s than most commentators.<br />Nanos' thesis is that Paul is rebuking Gentile Christians for being arrogant about their grace-oriented lifestyle, and that the weak and the strong in Romans aren't Jewish Christians and Gentile Christians (as interpreted for, goodness, 1900+ years?), rather non-Christian Jews and Jewish/Gentile Christians.  The Christians are the &quot;strong&quot; because they rely on God's grace, the Jews &quot;weak&quot; because they rely on the law.  However, the term &quot;weak&quot; is not necessarily prejorative.  In fact, Nanos states that the weak are stumbling *because* of the arrogance of the strong regarding violating the Law.  The Christians are chastized in the letter, not exalted, and the Christians are asked to be more &quot;Jewish&quot;, or at least, Noachidic.  <br />The Jews are still considered brethren, the calling of God is irrevocable, the seed of Abraham is the branch which sustains the Church, and &quot;all Israel will be saved&quot; (pas Israel sothesetai).  Nanos backs all this up.  This is a challenge to 'Replacement Theologians,' as Replacementers rely on this letter for much of their arguments.  <br />I also found Nanos' comments on the Shema and its role in the Gospel enlightening.	2004-06-26

I found Dimont's interpretation of events enlightening -- for example, in the Middle Ages the ghettoization and ostracization of Jews, in a way, helped the Jews, because they were free from the ludicrous system of Feudalism.  Could we consider the Jews the originators of the Free Market system (which is a good thing)?  Dimont hints at this.  <br />I also didn't know that the Church was in many ways the *protector* of the Jews (Gregory the Great forbade the forced conversion of Jews), and that it was lay Christians who incited and joined the Anti-Semitic mobs.  This makes \\"sense\\" in a social psychological way(not to give credence to Jew hatred).  You have a bunch of serfs, illiterate, ignorant of their own religion, ignorant of the Tanach/Old Testament (Catholic Church liturgy really builds entirely from the NT), ostensibly owned by their lords, and then you have a bunch of educated, \\"free\\" Jews who were different religously from the oppressed Christians.  Jealousy, envy, perception of a disruption in the \\"natural\\" order, thus Anti-Semitism.  The Nazis would pick up on this later, quite literally emphasizing the \\"natural order\\", except the Nazis, as Dimont shows, aren't Christian but anti-Christian as well as anti-Jew.  Their hatred of Jews had nothing to do w/ \\"deicide\\", rather motive that can only be described as Darwinian pagan \\"Blood and Soil\\".  The Nazis had enough Zyklon-B gas to kill 20 million more, yet only 3 million Jews left in Europe after the evils of the Final Solution.  The Nazis were going to go after everyone.  <br />I also liked the tidbits Dimont throws in: Germans during WWII had a higher suicide rate than Jews in the concentration camps.  Amazing!  What spirit pulses through the seed of Abraham!  This book reaffirmed my faith in the Creator.  This is an excellent book for Christians to read, so that all Christians may understand and appreciate the history of our Jewish brethren.	2004-06-25

About the midway point, conveniently when the grammar gets more advanced, I think the explanations and lessons start to weaken.  That could be just the nature of the level of study, when you get into Optative mood and all the obnoxious Genitive usages, nonetheless, that is when the instruction should step up and clarify better. I felt the instruction took a step back instead. Nonethless, the beginning chapters are excellent, just be prepared to be patient when you get to the really hard stuff.	2004-06-25

I will just say this:  if you want to know why 3rd world countries are 3rd world countries, and what Gov'ts around the world can do to create prosperity for their people, read this book.  Nations are poor because of ill-guarded private property rights.  It's that simple.  They aren't poor because of lack of socialism (quite the opposite), they aren't poor because of lack of resources, it's because &quot;It's the property rights, stupid!&quot;<br />Books like this can give hope to the pessimist, that it is possible to end serious poverty in the world.  Relative poverty will always exist, but the civilization-destabilizing poverty that exists in the Arab world, in Latin America, *can* be cured if Gov'ts would just put in place a system that allows capital (ie entreprenuers) to grow from the natural resources within the country.  Replace Socialism w/ Rule of Law.  I hope every member of the Iraqi CPA has read this book and heeded its lessons...	2004-06-24

This book is wonderfully enlightening, loaded w/ juicy nuggets that should make the average Krugmanite squirm -- like how the Fair Labor Standards Act cost 35,000-50,000 Southern African Americans their jobs, the negative redistribution effects of the Social Security System (blacks are poorer for it, and the wealthy prosper from it because they start work later and they live longer), the consistency of high unemployment throughout the FDR years while previous recessions (such as the one in 1920) were solved w/in a year by *cuts* in Gov't spending, the prosperity of NON-TVA states compared to those states which &quot;benefitted&quot; from the Tennessee Valley Authority non-market oriented Gov't intervention, the ludicrous Agriculture Act which destroyed domestic farming goods while relying on importing those same goods from abroad (What in God's name were the New Dealers THINKING!!!), Net private investment fell by 3 billion in the 30s because of over-taxation and regulation, the mortifying similarities between the New Deal and economic Fascism...I won't spoil all the surprises for you...<br />An valuable book, a primer as to what *not* to do in case of recession, and every politician should be forced to read this book, and probably every registered voter as well.	2004-06-23

Many of the meanings of terms and allusions are lost on us.  It would be like someone 2000 years from now reading the diary of a 21st Century American and stumbling upon the phrase, \\"It was raining cats and dogs outside today!\\", and this futuristic person interprets that phrase literally.<br />Bauckman reminds us that the diction of Revelation alludes consistently and beautifully to events in the Old Testament.  \\"The sea was no more\\", 21:4, what in the world does that mean?  Only dry land on the new earth?  No, it's an allusion to the chaotic primordial waters in the first chapter of Genesis, the waters that burst forth from the deep to destroy the earth during Noah's age.  That natural evil will no longer exist in the New Order.  <br />\\"They are virgins they have not defiled themselves w/ women\\", does this mean that there are only virgins in Heaven?  No, it's a reference to *war*.  Soldiers were to abstain from sexual relations w/ women before battle, like Bathsheba's husband in 2 Samuel. The war is fought and won by the slain lamb, Christ, and the soldiers participate by witnessing to the faith until the very end.  <br />These are just two examples of the insights that the author provides the reader.  I'm not sure I agree w/ all his points, but he makes a strong case for his, ostensibly, \\"symbolic\\" view of Revelation by placing the letter w/in the context of apocalyptic Jewish-Christianity undergoing Roman persecution.  One of my favorite points he makes, is the \\"libertarian\\" message in Revelation, that God is 'Pantokrator', the Almighty, the all powerful, the God of nature, and the blasphemous Roman Empire (\\"Who is Like the Beast?\\" (another juicy poetic counter to \\"Who is Like God?\\" from Exodus, and also the Hebrew name for Michael, who of course plays an important role in Revelation)) attempts to replace God w/ its human institution.  This deliciously implies the theological justification for Individual Liberty, that no Gov't should intervene between God and the conscience of the individual, for in doing so that is being like the Beast of Revelation. <br />Revelation is not only true in substance and message, but it is a work of *art*, something that the uber-literalists and Left Behind types overlook when ravenously searching for clues about the future.	2004-06-23

The Nazis believed in private property only insofar as it served the state, \\"The state should retain supervision and each property owner should consider himself appointed by the state.  It is his duty not to use his property against the interests of others among his people...The 3rd Reich will always retain the right to control the owners of property.\\"  This ideology articulated in the Nazi party platform is foreign to and incompatible w/ Capitalism.  Then when you look at the specifics of the job creation, unemployment was reduced entirely through public works and Gov't spending, and the price controls put in place in the mid-30s, and the capital punishment of \\"profiteers\\", well you get the picture, and there's plenty more in this book.<br />The Nazis and Communists were both spawned from the late 19th Century ideological crisis outlined by Nietschze, the Death of God by Darwin and Newton and all that jazz.  \\"What is to Be Done?\\", to quote the Leftist manifesto that inspired Lenin, well the Nazi Party agreed -- something drastic had to be done.  The Commies, the fascists, the Nazis had all lost hope in individual liberty and eternal values secured by a just God -- the cornerstones of Anglo-American \\"conservatism\\" -- and so a strong Gov't was needed to replace the absentee, dead landlord.  Society was to be reorganized from the top according to either nationalist, race, or class lines.  The individual was merely a clog in the machine, worthless unless in relation to the group.  The differences are cosmetic, the tyrannical results and intellectual structures the same.  It is morally and intellectually irresponsible to put Nazism and Sovietism as opposite ends of the spectrum, while intentionally trying to shove classical liberalism in w/ the Nazis.  There is nothing in common between Friedrich Hayek and the Nazi economist Lautenbach, who outlined Keynesianism before Keynes did.<br />The Nazis were interventionists, Socialists, New Dealers, and eerily similair to the \\"Corporate\\" Wellfare State Capitalism of modern France and Germany. This is one of the books that proves it.  Other good books, the \\"Logic of Evil\\" (which describes National Etatism more in depth) and \\"Heaven on Earth\\" by Muravchik, which describes Socialism and its fascist variant under Mussolini.	2004-06-23

The book is only 150 pages excluding the notes, yet 26.00?  The book covers the pre-Mesopotamian roots through Babylon and Assyria, the culture and the history.  What I liked in this book were the nuggets about Mesopotamian economics, how centralized planning led to overproduction of resources and ecological disaster.  Slaves and women were entreprenuers, investing in bars and brothels.  That is not something that is usually mentioned in surveys of the Ancient Mid-East.  Other than that, it is an overall satisfactory introduction to an important period, if you can get it used or through a book club.	2004-06-23

The Finnish courage and sense of humor, the sad pitiful state of Soviet soldiers, the Soviet's inhumanity and indifference to its own people, the waffling and Realpolitik of Western nations, the indepedence of Mannerheim, all come through in Trotter's writing.  The stories of Soviet soldiers trapped in barbed wire calling out to Stalin, the night-time hunter-seeker raids by pairs of Finns, the foolish tactics of the Soviets who would push their tanks far ahead of the troops and allow the Finns to ignore the tanks and slaughter the unprotected troops, the snow un-drinkable because of artillery contamination...<br />I guess I was a little disappointed that the &quot;ski attacks&quot; weren't as prevalent as I had believed.  One of the most visual scenes in WWII combat is the image of camoflauged Finns sweeping through trees w/ submachine guns blowing away Soviets, but the book tells of other Finnish tactics that were more successful (and realistic), such as the nighttime raid that forced the Soviets to get into a firefight w/ themselves.  An excellent book on guerilla warfare in the snow and ice.	2004-06-23

Through all the grotesque trials and tribulation, Armando finds strength in the truth of his principles and in his God.  He is a hero of mine, for I'm not sure I could withstand what he did.  The beatings, the psych and chemical torture, the (...)pits, the knowledge that the family suffers because of your absence, the hunger strikes, for twenty years.  Hundreds of anecdotes, mostly depressing (...), line the pages.  This should be mandatory reading for the Danny Glovers of the world, who sickingly worship the ghoul Castro.  Armando Valladares makes the world a better place, and we should all profit from learning about his life.  It is a book that will stick w/ you, in its message of overcoming the darkest of the dark w/ the thin light of Heaven and freedom.	2004-06-23

In the first half off the book, he relays heart-breaking anecdotes about sons unable to kiss their dying mothers after a chemical attack, children raped in front of their parents, prisoners forced to drink gasoline and shot so that they would explode, children surviving mass grave shooting, all in that &quot;noble&quot; Arab Gov't known as Saddam Hussein's Iraq.<br />The second half of the book is a scathing indictment of the Edward Saids and Noam Chomskys of the world who rationalize the inhumanity all too prevalent in the Mid-East, specifically in Iraq, &quot;Saddam was a victim, The U.S. is worse, Saddam's strong!&quot; and all that junk.  Because Makiya isn't a GOP Zionist, these criticisms are particularly strong and persuasive.  The book is a much needed call on the part of Arabs and Muslims to adopt a Liberty-based morality instead of a relativistic, ethnic allegience based morality.  A good book for all to read.	2004-06-23
US	49653147	R3KCEGSJUXW990	0806518561	707124067	The Philip K. Dick Reader	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Idea-driven Science Fiction	PKD was one of those rare writers who captivated you w/ his &quot;What if?&quot; scenarios rather than w/ unique characters or tight plotting.  You find yourself frantically turning the pages to find what mind-blowing extrapolation PKD will throw at you next, instead of what happens to the characters.<br />Because of this, I think his short fiction is in many ways more enjoyable than his novels.  His novels, although creative and imaginative masterpieces, tend to peter out plot-wise towards the end.  His short stories are more focused, and thus less likely to stray from the path.  This volume also saves the best for last, &quot;We Can Remember...&quot;, &quot;Minority Report&quot;, &quot;Paycheck&quot;, and &quot;Second Variety&quot;, and the opening stories are probably the weakest, &quot;Fair Game&quot; and &quot;The Hanging Stranger&quot;.  Yet even these two stories play off of PKD's paranoia and ironic metaphysics.  The Matrix, Being John Malcovich, heck post-70s X-Men all found precedence in the creativity of PKD.<br />PKD will put new thoughts in your head, show you things you couldn't show yourself -- that's what fiction should do.  Highly Recommended.	2004-06-23

It is also the first time a U.S. soldier died in a foreign land, and the first time the U.S. stood up to a bunch of punk bullies fat off of European coddling who deserved to get their butts spanked.  The first attempted &quot;regime change&quot;, the first &quot;special op&quot; war w/ native foot soldiers, and sadly, the first time the U.S. backed out of a committment to a foreign ally.  Quite like today.<br />There is a lot of good information in this book, not just a fairly detailed account of the Tripolitan War, but soft cinematic character studies of the major characters (Eaton, Decatur, Jefferson, the Bey), impressive &quot;camoes&quot; by the likes of Lord Nelson, and a nice ethnography of the Northern African character following the Spanish reconqest of Iberia.  It is an enjoyable read as well, and quite possibly a page turner to him who knows little about the era and is not quite sure how the &quot;story&quot; ends.  A more enjoyable read than most fiction, and educational.  What more can you ask?	2004-06-23
US	49653147	R3QPJN8CEO41PZ	0374175268	586571123	An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America	Books	4	13	16	N	N	More than just Washington	This book chronicles not only George Washington's personal transformation from unapologetic slave-owner to guilt ridden proto-abolitionist, but also lesser known vignettes about the other founding fathers and black patriots who fought and died to form this country.<br />The book neither apologizes nor damns Washington.  It is balanced and fair in its treatment of the first Prez.  At the end it slightly chastized Washington for not freeing his slaves while in office, and the example such an act would have set, yet the author covered his bases enough in the preceding chapters (ie the threat of British reconquest over a dividing America) to show how difficult the issue was Realpolitik-wise.  Slavery was evil, and most of the Founders knew it, and they feared for their country because of it.<br />Unlike Jefferson, Washington wasn't racist, and by the end of the War, Washington was heavily recruiting free blacks.  There is no indication that he treated them any less than whites, he visited all the soldiers preceding the daring assault at Yorktown.  He personally invited the black poet Phyllis Wheatley to Mount Vernon because he admired her work.  These stories are some of the most satisfying elements in the book, after all black patriotism during the Revolutionary War period is disgustinly neglected by most history books and contemporary interpretations of Revolutionary politics.   These black soldiers that formed most of the Rhode Island brigade (that saved Washington's life at Bunker Hill), that formed Glover's naval forces, they didn't fight for anachronistic Marxism, or Socialism, or class war, or an Exodus back to Africa, or &quot;Black Power&quot;, they fought for the same beautiful principles of individual liberty that Jefferson and the remaining Founding Fathers so hypocritically professed.<br />Washington, at least, the old General, knew this at the end of his life, and tried to rectify it.  By dealing honestly w/ the real issue of slavery and Washington's relationship with it, this book does more to valorize Washington than any whitewashing of the period would have.	2004-06-22

The Nazis had a utopian view of the natural order, the Volkgemeinschaft.  This led to a rejection of the Judeo-Christian worldview, and an embrace of monism.  Hitler:  \\"Man who lives in communion w/ nature necessarily finds himself in opposition to the churches.\\"  \\"Today, a new basis for the state has been established, whose claim is that it doese not see its foundation in Christendom\\"  Himmler:  \\"Man is a link in the chain of living nature just as any other organism.\\"  Man was both divine and worthless, as Man's value stems from his acquiessence to nature.  National Socialism had nothing in common w/ Christian tradition, and was in fact, antagonistic towards it.  This flies in the face of pop Hollywood politics, which views Christianity as necessisarily Fascism.<br />Two weaknesses from the book: 1.) Pois does not address the pagan connections to Nazi ideology and leaders.  I can understand that Hitler and Goebbels were pragmatists and not as \\"religiously\\" driven as Himmler and Hess, however this should still have been mentioned and 2.) The Intro and Outro of the book are worthless.  The Intro is basically an apology to fellow academics for analyzing the worldview of the Nazis.  Worthless. The Outro is a desparate attempt by the author to compare the Nazi's Darwinistic New Age environmentalism to American conservative politics.  It was a reach, and the author doesen't prove his case (mostly because it doesn't try to understand the American political spectrum, and is just feeding his prejudices).  His criteria--flight from history and valorization of the natural order--fits more w/ Marxist dialectic materialism (plenty of flight from history and sanctification of its 'natural order' there) than w/ Madisonian Libertarianism.	2004-06-21
