This \\"ex-streetfighter\\" turned bookwriter sounds like he's shooting the crap at a party where he's the center of attention and no one can get another word in. At times he sounds full of himself. He starts stories in the middle, very rarely finishes them and pontificates on life and society sometimes where one has no other choice but to fast forward.<br /><br />If I were one of those people listening to him as he told these stories, I'd find myself constantly saying, \\"So what happened?\\" or \\"How did this thing start. What did you do to cause this guy to pick you, of all the people in the room, to want to stomp?\\" It's frustrating when he gets into his storytelling, only to trail off into social commentary when he's left everyone begging a number of questions.<br /><br />As a journalist, I've heard a great number of stories by a great number of interesting people: death row inmates, wardens, World War II heroes, including infantrymen, submariners and the sort. And most could leave you sitting on the edge of your seat. Sometimes I find myself almost yelling at MacYoung's books: \\"Can't you give it a rest? Get back to the story. How did you get yourself into this and did the guy ever come back to even the score?\\"<br /><br />I'd be dishonest if I said I didn't enjoy his colorful language or his stories. His interspection into the other characters in his life aren't given much thought. He'll say things like, I don't know what the guy's problem was, maybe he got a verbal beating from his old lady and hadn't gotten laid that day.\\" What kind of social analysis is this. He'd just been talking about why certain societies rise and fall and now THIS?<br /><br />Grain of salt is how I'd take MacYoung, but he is entertaining. He knows that, his editors know that and he's making $$$ on being entertaining. And that's great up to a point. He now has to find ways of making his books not just more of the same. And he's got a real chore ahead of him.<br /><br />***-1/2 starshead of him. <br /> <br />***-1/2 stars <br /> <br />	2005-09-30

Not those nice Iranian people you have for neighbors--the ones who helped you out during last year's snow storm. Remember? Your vehicle got stuck in the snow and he and his son came over and pushed and shoveled until you got momentum, then all you had time for was to wave your thanks. No, we're talking about what the Qur'an teaches. What its members are supposed to believe and do.<br /><br />I'm giving this book five stars despite two significant oversights. First, for not discussing the proverbial fork in the road that separates the Jews from the Arabs and the bitter dispute about Jacob's birthright, which Esau foolishly bargained away. Islam doesn't believe a birthright can be bartered away, even though Hebrew thought and tradition indicates it can. Morever, the prophets that followed also adequately show that God Himself recognized the barter of the foolish Esau.<br /><br />Finally, not enough emphasis is placed on the Qur'an or the people. I've read the Qur'an in vain, seeking wisdom, depth of thought, mind-boggling prophecies and, most importantly, the mind, will and resolve of the God of Abraham.<br /><br />If more Muslims understood the God of \\"the Book\\" (which is to say, the Bible), they would see the being they call Allah is a cheap carbon copy of Jehovah, being closer to the wrath of Zeus but lacking the wisdom of Odin.<br /><br />An example! You want an example. On page 143, the author notes the words of Jesus in Matthew 5:7, 46-47: \\"Blessed art the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.\\" Further: \\"For if you love those who love you, what reward do you reserve for that? Do not even [the wicked] do that? And if you only greet those who believe as you, what more are you doing than do others.\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, heeding those words will gain you respect and love from others and it will not lead to bloodshed. Yet the wrathful, supposedly merciful Allah, has another philosopy, greet your brethren and kill the others: \\"Muhammad is Allah's apostle. Those who follow him are ruthless to the unbelievers, but merciful to one another.\\" Qur'an 48:29<br /><br />I'm convinced if it were the predilection of men to study religion, especially their own in relation to others, that Islam would have died out long ago. Most thinking people couldn't, wouldn't follow this Genghis Kang type of theology that preaches a dangerous intolerance that's known to less ignorant victims throughout the world. I'll bet you thought the Serbs just loved killing Bosnians for the joy of commiting murder, huh? No, they killed the Bosnians because they'd had it up to here with Islam's sick intolerance of other faiths, the illogical taxes on NOT being Islam, their ridiculous laws on how the others should DRESS, EAT and DRINK. Muslims in Serbian-dominated areas were left alone, why not Serbians in Muslim-dominated areas?<br /><br />Where Jesus taught his people to \\"Search the scriptures,\\" Islam expects only obediance and submission. And since Muhammad is supposed to be Allah's \\"last messenger,\\" spiritual guides are only that. With no revelation from Allah, no guiding spirit, many of Islam's self-appointed leaders go forth and command blood baths to the extent their followers are willing to carry them out. All by the authority of the Qur'an.<br /><br />The author also exposes the myths surrounding the crusades. Most casual students only see the top of the iceberg and rely on Islamic leaders to record how unjust the crusades were. I can't speak for the author, but I believe there will be room in hell for many people on both sides who shed innocent blood.<br /><br />In the meantime, I recommend this book only if you're unwilling to read a history of the Qur'an and the Qur'an itself. I don't know who conjured the words that the prophet recited, but it wasn't the God of Abraham. It wasn't the God who led Moses out of Egypt or said the greatest of all commandments was to love one's fellow man.<br /><br />To Muslims I recommend this book. I also recommend they look for the telltale signs of inspiration that would come from a book dictated and commissioned of God. I can find none. Reading it makes my heart stone that man would murder his fellow man with such casual disregard. \\"Allah assigns a person to participate in jihad...and nothing compels him to do so EXCEPT 1) belief in Allah...that he will be rewarded by Allah with a reward or booty, or 2)he will be admitted to Paradise [if he is martred].\\"<br /><br />Before I cut anyone's throat, I'd certainly find out who's holding the keys to the gates of Paradise and who dictated what to whom and under what circumstances. Making the wrong decision could land a soul in a world of hurt, and for a very long time.<br /><br />Finally, cultural differences abound between Islam and most other religions today. As the author notes, The Qur'an and Islamic law treat women as nothing more than the possessioh of men, the Qur'an sanctions wife beating and it allows for child marriages.<br /><br />Again, this isn't your kindly neighbors; Islam is a religion that thankfully is neglected by most of its adherents. What scares me is that the fundamentalist extremists seem to be smart enough to interpret the book correctly, but spiritually blind enough not to see who its author is.ms I recommend this book.

I'm familiar with some of his old stomping grounds in Ventura and have met the acqaintance of people like him. The real tragedy is that there are areas across the U.S. that breed brash troublemakers who not only put you in the precariouis position of haing to defend yourself with a crude weapon like a knife, but themselves. Many such punks routinely bite off more than they can chew, relegating them to mere predators, and not too smart ones at that.<br /><br />Animal says it and I've seen it, but the best way to stay out of trouble and avoid the situations he teaches you how to deal with when things have gone too far, is courtesy. I'm sure Animal would never say so in print, but I'm certain he's forced loudmouthed louts into fights when they would rather not have fought because they said or did something that he found to be rude to himself or someone else. One can't be in that crowd without being part of it.<br /><br />Now, looking back on it, he's realized how senseless it all is. He still commands respect in his circle and under some situations others might find innocuous, he's probably capable of being driven to violence to this day. And if he's known as the author of books, there are probably those who are anxious to take him on.<br /><br />All this brings not only a wealth of knowledge to his books, but a tremendous sense of the senselessness of violence. Dying for a noble cause--something one believes in--is honorable. Dying because you are piss poor drunk and said the wrong thing to the wrong person is a tragedy that, like AIDS, can be avoided by keeping everything where it belongs.<br /><br />If you're a yuppie or a retiree, you're probably not going to be in situations Animal describes; however, it's still insightful to see how the psychology of the biker bar stand works. Long hair, bandanas, pony tails, leather jackets, leather armbands, hairy arms, ego and, of course, knives, beer bottles and puke. This is the world you'll be hearing about in Animal's books which are in essence guides to living in his world. When you're done with the entertainment there, pick up a book on the mob and learn how to survive with the Sopranos.<br /><br />I enjoy Animal's books, but I've never been part of that world and never hope to be.

How many of the original states would have joined the Union if they were told they couldn't leave it? It would be like telling the United States it couldn't leave the United Nations.<br /><br />Although Abraham Lincoln didn't start the ball rolling on secession, he did bring it to a head and became the worst tyrant this country has ever had. He committed the U.S. to a war without the consent of Congress, blockaded a Southern port without a declaration of war, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, imprisoned dozens of newspaper editors, replaced Maryland's state representatives with federal apointees and imprisoned the elected officials in Fort McHenry (where they had to live in filth and eat food not fit for animals). Frederick, Md., was surrounded and Democrats were imprisoned on the mere suspicion that they were secessionists; Lincoln's army went North to New York City, and during a four day war with the city's militia and citizens, killed thousands. In the South he ordered the extermination of untold thousands of people, bringing the war to civilians. Telegraph wires cut? Simple. Take four or five citizens from the nearest town, line them up against the wall and shoot them. What about homes with women, children and the elderly? Give them the chance to vacate and if the slaves tried to defend the property, kill them first.<br /><br />Had not John W. Booth parted Lincoln's hair at Ford's Theater, who knows whether he would have ever given up power. He was a tyrant with an army behind him. How many of those have given up power without being killed, like Julius Caesar?<br /><br />I recommend DiLorenzo's book, THE REAL LINCOLN. Hopefully one day, Lincoln's statue will be dragged out of his temple and America's number 1 Nazi will then be exposed in real history books. Meanwhile, the fictional Lincoln lives on in the hearts and souls of the ignorant.<br /><br />Thornton clearly wishes to awaken the soul of the Old South; unfortunately, the cause was lost. Even Southerners revere the monster, thanks to reconstruction and the rewriting of history. But God will judge in the end.nton clearly wishes to awaken the soul of the Old South; unfortunately, the cause was lost.

The information he conveys, one would think, would be about knives and steel, but he can't resist going back to technique.<br /><br />I bought this book wanting to read what the title promised. I was disappointed. Things he could have appropriately included would be: 1) the qualities of steel. Does it matter if a defensive knife is made from 420 stainless steel or is there anything to be gained from a higher quality steel like AUS 8 or AUS 6? Gerber uses 440A steel for some of its folders, yet 440A really doesn't have a good reputation among knife afficianados; 2) things to look for before buying and using a knife. I recently bought a knife, the blade of which would not remain open. The cause? The base of the blade was ground at the wrong angle for the liner lock to engage. The blade slid along the angle and disengaged, allowing the blade to close on one's fingers; 3) blade lengths, which he arbitrarily sets as 6-inches for a minimum in a defense knife. Yet many find 4-5-inch knives to be adequate.<br /><br />I wish the book would have contained more information on knives and that Janich would have reached into his own personal experience. Even tips on knife sharpening would have been nice.	2005-07-24

Nevertheless, much of what Kennedy reveals is old hat to \\"civil war\\" buffs and historians. (The lesson here is: Never get your facts from a text book.)<br /><br />When I listen to today's black leaders demanding reparations, I just laugh, but it's a bitter laugh. Just how much would be enough to right the wrongs of American slavery? A hundred dollars per person of black ancestery? How about a thousand? Reparationists never say how much they want; they just say that any amount isn't enough, which leaves everyone in a quandry.<br /><br />The \\"Christian\\" black activists who talk more about reparations and affirmative action than Christ, ignore the Bible's declarations that the children shall not pay for the misdeeds of their forebears. They are among the \\"vipers\\" and \\"hypocrites\\" who have perverted Christianity.<br /><br />And by the way, has anyone heard of the Turks, Romans and Greeks, who carried away tens of thousands of people of all colors into slavery? Has anyone heard of Spartacus, the white slave and gladiator? And then there were the white cowboys who wandered off and found themselves doing forced labor at the point of a gun while men on horseback supervised. Then there was forced duty aboard ships. Many a landlubber with a few too many to drink woke up in the holds of ships already at sea.<br /><br />The authors could have written more about how American slavery compared to other world slavery throughout the ages. The institution was failing in the South because what began to dawn on plantation owners is what's dawned on our greedy corporate heads today. Contracting out the work was cheaper. That way, they didn't have to feed them or look after their medical needs, they didn't have to build quarters in which to house the slaves. And if some of them didn't work hard, they could be fired and replaced with someone else who could.<br /><br />We also know the complicity of black Africans in selling other tribesmen into slavery. Yada, yada, yada.<br /><br />The bottom line is that Abraham Lincoln was a tyrant and a money grubber who believed in extreme taxation for extreme government. When he put his dragon's hand upon the Bible and swore to uphold the Constitution, the 10th Amendment melted away. The story in this book is only a partial story.

After reading four books on knife fighting, I'm beginning to realize there's not much more to be said, especially when Richard Ryan is saying it. \\"Pathetic\\" he calls man. A \\"walking sack of meat.\\" No built-in mechanisms for defense, obviously not a predator by nature. Man had to \\"claw his way up\\" the foodchain.<br /><br />Is this guy for real?<br /><br />If you begin with a false premise, you can only get better and there are some relevant material in the book--if you can get past Ryan's flaming ego, which doesn't take long to become a smoldering ember.<br /><br />But with all the useful information which, by the way, you can get elsewhere in far more entertaining ways, Ryan rapidly becomes tedious to read. The truth is, man has always been the most dangerous creature roaming this planet. Even cave deptictions show groups of armed men taking down creatures much larger and faster than themselves. And did anyone notice that most of early man wore fur and leather footwear.<br /><br />It wasn't only weapons that made man dangerous, it was his resourcefulness and, did anyone say fire? Given to mortal man by the immortal Prometheus, it made man almost as powerful as the gods. Soon Greeks were putting sticks into the ground and mathematically figuring out the circumference of the globe. Then Persians, Greeks and Romans were making war using horses and elephants, and bronze and leather weapons, marching in formation and boldly claiming dominance over the land. Pathetic? \\"Walking sacks of meat?\\" Oh, and let's not forget in God's image.<br /><br />The bottom line in knife fighting is, if someone wants to kill you with a knife, he probably will if he's smart enough and committed enough. Very few people are \\"called out\\" for knife fighting -- dirks have always been an assasin's tool, nearly everyone's last choice for going at it in the so-called \\"circle of death\\" in a fair fight.<br /><br />When you can see the bad guy coming. When you see the predator's gleam in his eyes, then a knife can come in very handy. Tick someone off in a bar and a blade's likely to end up in your ribs before you can try all that macho knife stuff you learned.<br /><br />A fellow I once knew pulled out a giant fold-out knife and laid it on the table so I could get a good look at it. Then he told me about two guys who were following him one night in a bad section of D.C.

Unfortunately the humor was only an \\"Oh, yeah?\\" response that, though many times managed to hit the mark, was little more than embarrassingly defensive and bitter. The only way to succeed against people like Limbaugh and Coulter is to use their tactics.

Day Lewis, is more than passable, but not up to the standard of Robert Fagles. The audio recording also suffers from using an aging Jill Balcon, who for some reason was not only cast for female roles, but the god Mercury. For goddesses such as Venus and Juno, one would expect to hear the voices of 20-year old women, not the craggy voice of an older woman or women. Paul Scofield relentlessly reads the text, but completely lacks the force of Derek Jacobi in the Iliad and Odyssey. Jacobi's rendition of Hermes (Mercury) is that of a cheery lad, not the angry god who prods the wandering Aeneas ever onward. <br /> <br />I realize Virgil uses the Roman names of the gods, but I would have been more comfortable coming from hearing the Iliad and going right into the Aeneid using the Greek names. The continuity would have been better. <br /> <br />All in all, this version is okay seeing nothing better is available, but Mercury riding the sky's \\"breezes\\" I think would have been better rendered \\"winds.\\" <br /> <br />It's a remarkable story and one I wish Jacobi would do. But it's easy to get spoiled after listening to him. No one else can come close, though Toby Stphens himself is far better than Scofield. <br /> <br />	2005-05-30

Both are common sense guides to people who want to protect themselves and their families in difficult times.<br /><br />When Hurricane Andrew ravaged the South in 1992, the police were stretched to the limit and people suddenly found themselves reponsible for defending themselves and their homes and families from the sub-human predators that emerge in the aftermath of such tragedies.<br /><br />These are not the times to learn, but to put into practice what you should have already mastered. What are your rights as a homeowner? How do you protect yourselves until order is restored? How do you keep yourself from being a target of other peoples' aggression?<br /><br />Eugene Sockut offers sound advice on living armed in an urban war zone, covering weapon selection and use. His perspective is one that most Americans will not understand, though in coming years many may understand all too well.<br /><br />In American society, a person can get away carrying just one gun for most situations, but in the urban war zone of Jerusalem and the Palestinian areas, Sockut carries two and he tells you how and why, harking back to America's old West. Limited to only a knife? Sockut tells you the type to carry and how to use it, showing all the arteries and tendons and explaining what will happen when they're sliced. Finally, Sockut lectures his readers on their state of awareness and when to elevate it and the consequences of not doing so.<br /><br />People who think only the police should protect them may learn some things they'd rather not know, the first of which is their philosophy of life is dead wrong. If you find yourself somewhere where you can't defend yourself, even when you're armed, you probably shouldn't be there. Don't ever rely only on the authorities and don't be too quick to escalate a bad situation.<br /><br />The book isn't intended to scare; it's intended to strip away the veneer created by society that all is well and that government alone can adequately protect you from the bad guys.

Like most of McCammon's works, things look bleak but never impossible. Two forces, one for good and one for evil, fight for the future of the world in one of the world's largest cities. This is no Stephen King novel, nor should it be. King frequently crosses the line into sick, aberrant behavior that goes well past entertainment. In Salam's Lot, the family eating dinner is interrupted by the vampire crashing through the window. Rising like a demon, he smashes the heads of the mother and father into each other, instantly killing both right in front of the boy. Scary? Not particularly. Violent? Unsettling<br /><br />In They Thirst, one of the scariest parts of the book is at the weather station. How better to trap the population of Los Angeles than to bring forth a supernatural storm of titanic proportions? A storm that could lift huge amounts of sand from the Mojave Desert and carry it over the mountains. The meteorologist takes one look at the radar and can't believe what he sees. A massive black cloud approaching at frightening speeds. Then flecks of sand begin hitting the window.<br /><br />Soon the city is cut off from the rest of the world by a blinding sand storm during the day. At night, the storm abates and the creatures come out of the cellars seeking human food. For the evil head vampire, it looks like certain success, but his evil master sees danger. There is always a counterthreat to evil, and it's often disguised as innocence; power, often disguised by helplessness. This is what makes this book far better than Salam's Lot.	2005-03-25

It doesn't correct every error you ever read, but it does substantially increase one's overall understanding of what really happened and lays a solid foundation for further research, which, by the way, you will find substantiates Dr. Woods assertions beautifully.<br /><br />Many in the South will not be surprised to learn that slavery wasn't the cause of the so-called Civil War; however, it will open the eyes of many in the North. What caused the war? Primarily a dispute of where federal powers ended and where states' rights began. Slavery was a part of the political debate smoldering on both sides, but it was an issue that Lincoln was willing to give on -- providing the southern states remained in the Union. The federal tariffs, which were crippling the South, though, were nonnegotiable. So the South left the Union for the same reason the patriots declared independence from Britain.<br /><br />\\"If I thought this war was to abolish slavery,\\" said Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, himself a slave owner, \\"I would resign my commission and offer my sword to the other side.\\"<br /><br />In his third annual message to the Union, in 1866, President Johnson said: \\"Candor compels me to declare that at this time there is no Union as our fathers understood the term, and as they meant it to be understood by us.\\"<br /><br />When the Fourteenth Amendment was up for ratification, 10 of the 11 former Confederate states opposed it despite the fact that on the face it was a just law. Were the Southern states just being paranoid? \\"The people of the South have rejected the constitutional amendment,\\" thundered Wisconsin Senator James Doolittle. \\"And therefore we will march upon them and force them to adopt it at point of bayonet...until they do adopt it.\\"<br /><br />No, no paranoia there. Such talk in the federal government in 1860 would have been unimaginable. No wonder the South left!<br /><br />With the South's defeat, federal power put the U.S. on a path to federal dictatorship. Orville Browning, Johnson's secretary of the Interior and an Illinois politician, said, \\"One of the greatest perils which threatens us now is the tendency to centralization, the absorption of the rights of the States and the concentration of all power in the General Government. When that shall be accomplished, if ever, the days of the Republic are numbered.\\"<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book. In fact, it should be required reading.

There's nothing like curling up with one and leaving reality for an hour or two. But it's even nicer to lay back, close one's eyes and listen to this wonderful classic tale told by the greatest living Shakespearian actor on the planet. And this translation of the Iliad is perfect for such storytelling.<br /><br />A friend, criticizing Brad Pitt's Achilles in the recent movie TROY, complained that Pitt's portrayal of the world's greatest warrior was one who was too much of a philosopher and cynic. \\"Just like Homer's Achilles,\\" I reminded him. And there's no shortage of Achilles' righteous indignation at the pompous Agamemnon, son of Atreus, who sacrificed his only daughter, Iphigenia, to Artimis for favorable winds to ill-fated Troy. Given this, it should be no trouble choosing sides: Agamemnon, the great king of kings or Achilles, of whom Agamemnon called \\"the most dangerous man I've ever met.\\"<br /><br />Jacobi first came to the attention of many Americans for his portrayal of the Roman Emperor Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus, the wily old republican who became the adoptive father of Nero, the mad emperor. Since the death of Lawrence Olivier, Jacobi has generally been regarded as the greatest living Shakespearian actor. Olivier, in his last days, apparently disagreed, saying Jacobi was greater than he. In the midst of all this modesty and tribute, the viewer/listener will have to come to his or her own conclusion.<br /><br />This is a wonderful CD.	2005-03-07

To those who seem to have only now discovered this book is \\"conservative,\\" congratulations! The definition of conserve is \\"to protect from loss or harm,\\" and the author is trying his best to argue that the Supreme Court today is causing loss and harm to a quaint old document we call the Constitution of the United States.<br /><br />In fact, Dr. Levin makes no bones about rolling back the clock and taking government back from these appointed dictators who have given themselves the power to change the Constitution by a simple majority vote. But even liberals can be conservative about some things, and vice versa, and Levin makes the stark point that if we ignore this problem and wait for someone else to do something about it, we'll one day wake up in a country the founders would have taken up arms to overthrow!<br /><br />To those who read this book and think the balance of powers between the three branches of government is how it should be, congratulate yourselves for helping to pave the road ahead to fascism. In fact, this book is so conservative in wanting to preserve the original intent of the founders, that were they here today, all of them -- even Hamilton -- would strongly endorse what Levin has written. It's the clarion call to resistance, and Democrats and Rempublicans would do well to heed this warning, because if it's not read now, it will certainly be read by future generations studying the fall of the United States.	2005-02-23

But Aaron Tonkin tells us he couldn't get them out of his system. He was, he tells us, as enthralled with their presence and they were with his presents.<br /><br />In truth, this book is a bit difficult to swallow. Tonkin might be writing it as one last con -- aimed at the reader -- but the price he extracts is too high. Is one's reputation worth the amount of $$$ that a book like this would bring in? Apparently Tonkin is too stupid either way to make much of a difference.<br /><br />Falling under the spell of the Clintons is understandable. They've probably got many more former friends than they do friends. But letting wealthy Hollywood celebrities go on unrestricted spending binges would cure most intelligent people in a matter of hours or days, not months or years.<br /><br />If Tonkin is telling the truth, he's an imbecile and if he's lying, he's also an imbecile. I found my greatest disappointment of this book learning about some of the people I've enjoyed watching and listening to over the years. I only met one true entertainment celebrity in my life and spent several hours with him and a Navy captain who was a Paramount consultant. The latter was not someone most people would have heard of, but he was much more fascinating and substantive than the lowlife scum we were accompanying (in preparation for a movie about a hunt for a submarine).<br /><br />This book is worth the read, but it won't enhance your view of the human race much. And by publishing it, Tonkin makes no bones in admitting he's a crass loser who fails to learn from his mistakes.	2005-02-10

As did Lincoln, Sherman believed the easiest way to win the war was to cut wherever the blade could. Only through sheer ferocity and terror could the war finally come to an end.<br /><br />It had gone on far too long for Lincoln. His popularity had plummeted and the general U.S. population was so terrorized by its own government that even the Republic was on the verge of collapse. Habeas corpus had been suspended and the Lincoln administration had arrested thousands of people on sheer suspicion of being secessionists. It wasn't supposed to be a long war, but it was. It wasn't supposed to have the horrendous casualties, but it did. Lincoln and his generals were determined to bring it to a close as quickly as possible, even if they had to resort to Nazi-like tactics. These tactics weren't hearsay or rumors; they didn't go unnoticed by the commanding officers. They had one purpose. End the war before the war ended the Northern nation.<br /><br />Even Caligula did some things that were kind-hearted, such as freeing the polical prisoners of the demented Tiberius; even Nero loved and revered his mother...right up to the time he had her murdered. So it's no surprise that Sherman had his good points. Hitler liked animals. Sherman's problem is he was honest. He just didn't hide his atrocities behind flowery language as did Lincoln.<br /><br />This book will bring you closer to an accurate view of the so-called \\"Civil War\\" than any you have studied in school. I also recommend DiLorenzo's excellent, THE REAL LINCOLN. You'll never view the U.S.'s first undeclared war the same.	2005-01-19

Instead, we should be tolerant of others and respect their views even if they're different from our own.<br /><br />Ah, but that was before Ann Coulter. The truth is, liberals have always been less tolerant, generalized without mercy or regret, hated with a searing hate and yes, were the first on a liberal bandwagon, particularly before the facts were known and even after (when they thought they could get away with it).<br /><br />What Ann Coulter did was remove the restraint. Without apology she threw back the bolt and showed us Dorian Gray's portrait, replete in its horror. And liberals don't like the picture they see of themselves. But no wonder. Who else could hate Hitler and defend Stalin...er...\\"Uncle Joe\\"? Who else could despise McCarthy, but swoon over Alger Hiss? And finally, who else could loathe Antony Scalia, but praise Thurgood Marshall?<br /><br />Ann rips the hypocrisy from the liberals and the liberals scream because of the wax.

And guess what? It's a .45-caliber bullet wound said to be self-inflicted. I can't help but think how lucky Mr. Clinton was. And how conveeeenient it was for the local to use a U.S. caliber instead of a 9mm or .380.<br /><br /> But I have to admit this hit was cleaner than the Vince Foster hit. Now the guy who did Vince was a rank amateur. They should let the mob go back to doing these things. They were much better.<br /><br /> For those who believe this was all coincidence, there are a lot of good books on the Easter Bunny here.	2004-07-25

Otherwise they wouldn't be making the snide, ignorant remarks they're making.<br />I've read Jayna Davis' reports since she first began her investigation and her culminating work is a top-notch example of investigative reporting at its best. She did what the FBI didn't do, didn't want to do, and what other reporters were too lazy to do. While the FBI edited and fabricated its witness reports, Davis carefully interviewed the witnesses and objectively reports what they saw and heard.<br />Her years of research have paid off, but even she can't finish her story without the aid and support of honest intelligence gathering. To me she's proved the connection without a doubt. Now it's time for the government to tell what it knows.<br />Read the book yourself and judge. Chances are you'll see the Iraq war in an entirely new light. For liberals, this book will dash their fondest desire to blame the extreme right wing militia groups and &quot;Christian fanatics.&quot; But to objective readers, it will open up an entirely different reality backed up with facts.<br />Recommended highly.	2004-04-20

He was, as his book reflects, brilliant, egotistical and opinionated. He also was a confirmed socialist who believed the world could be a better place if the educated elite ruled.<br />Former President Clinton said in 1992: \\"...As a student at Georgetown, I heard that call clarified by a professor named Carroll Quigley, who said to us that America was the greatest country in the history of the world because our people have always believed in two things: that tomorrow can be better than today and that every one of us has a personal, moral responsibility to make it so.\\"<br />Unfortunately, Dr. Quigley revealed the game plan of the elite when the elite (a shy group by nature and not at all given to republican government) didn't want it publicized. Far from wanting to hide this &quot;network&quot; (as he called it), Quigley was proud of it.<br />&quot;I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960's, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies...but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.&quot;<br />Thus, unfortunately, Tragedy and Hope was pulled from bookshelves nationwide and recalled faster than an exploding Easter Bunny, never to be published again, except for a highly abbreviated edition. But if you can pick up a copy of this book, you'll find how things often worked behind the scenes of government and the worldwide ambitions of &quot;the network.&quot;<br />If you simply want to know about the network and how it operated up until this book was published, I recommend Dr. W.

Is he going to be a comedian or a social commentator. This book, and his previous documentary Bowling for Columbine are clear indications that he can't do both. And this is unfortunate.<br />Moore's humor, when not political, is entertaining and he's a likable guy beneath his trademark slob appearance. But if one is to interject humor into politics, one must pay attention to detail and accuracy. His Columbine documentary had a great emotional impact on me at the time I saw it, for example, until I read several critical reviews that left me deeply disappointed in his inattention to accuracy.<br />Moore makes many interesting observations in Dude, Where's My Country, but he allows his own bitterness to taint the humor. And his attention span in any specific area is fleeting. Conservatives often complain that liberals resort too much to name calling and people like Moore only make the situation worse. Beneath his humor I assume there is a genuine deep concern; however, this sort of book requires considerable research and documentation -- and this is sadly lacking. Conservative Ann Coulter's books are very well documented, but she's like a spitting cobra, spewing venom from every page.<br />I wish I had read a little of Moore's book at a store before buying it. I probably would have put it on my library book list instead. His Columbine documentary was so filled with glaring inaccuracies that I find it difficult to trust what he cites in Dude. Still, I bought the Columbine documentary for its entertainment value, but I don't know that I'll ever trust Moore's &quot;facts&quot; again.<br />All in all, Moore makes his points, interjecting them with a bitter humor. He uses too many ad hominem attacks, but the book is worth a read if you want some laughs at the expense of conservatives. Conservatives, of course, are advised to stay away from this book entirely. They won't like it.<br /><br /> -	2003-10-21

Al Franken resorts to what many liberals do instinctively when they write about the right.

Bush is or dismissing an idea or statement by rolling their eyes and reminding me that I'm quoting Tom DeLay and thus the idea is not even worth responding to.<br />Al Franken hates with the same fury that Ann Coulter hates; the difference being that Coulter at least backs up what she says with facts, dates and figures. Franken just calls her a &quot;nutcase&quot; and uses his wit to put down individual conservatives and neocons. And the best part about it, from his standpoint, is he doesn't have to do much research. Just sit down at a computer and bang it out. Ha-ha.<br />All-in-all, these people are name callers.

It wastes no time getting to the point, and DiLorenzo's masterful handling of complex material is as fascinating in its content as it is its condemnation of a man many believe to be America's greatest president.<br />But if Abraham Lincoln was America's greatest president, then it is an America quite removed from the one envisioned and framed by the founding fathers. The framers wrote volumes warning future generations against the evils of centralized government, oppressive taxes (especially an income tax), federal subsidies, tyrannical democracy, and central banking. Each of these Lincoln willingly embraced, the entire time pretending to revere and sustain the Constitution he was undermining.<br />His sweeping disregard of the 10th and 2nd Amendments, his suspension of the 1st Amendment and the writ of habeas corpus, his leashing of an illconceived an undeclared war, unrestrained murder of innocent civilians during war and use of punitive tariffs were all part of a calculated reign of terror.<br />The proverbial wool that has been placed over the eyes of millions in the North and South is brutally sheared by DiLorenzo and many may not like what they see. Even so, a sizable number of Republicans and Democrats will feel Lincoln's departure from the antiquated notions of states' rights and limited federal authority was not only justified, but part of the Nation's evolution towards \\"a more perfect Union.\\" Indeed, it's amazing how similar today's Republican Party is to the Republican/Whig parties of Lincoln's time. It's equally as amazing to see how the Democrats, once the standard bearers of the Constitution, the founding fathers and limited government, now obnoxiously advocate blatant socialism, oppressive federal taxation and a central government without practical limits.<br />DiLorenzo's book has the virtue of being insightful, well written and devastating to the Lincolnian myth. Many of Lincoln's defenders will no doubt sputter and choke in rage, but they will be hard pressed to answer DiLorenzo's charges with anything except name calling.<br />In In many respects the America of 1776 ceased to exist on the day Lincoln took office.
