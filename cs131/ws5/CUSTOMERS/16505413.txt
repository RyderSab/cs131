A delightful book about White and Sorin's life in Paris, with an inevitable undercurrent of sadness, because Sorin is dying. Yet his inability to practice his work as an architect led him to develop the \\"unique, exuberant drawing style\\" that illustrates this book.<br /><br />Here you will meet all sorts of interesting people. The concierge, Madame Denise, and the coiffeuse who tries out all the latest hairstyles on her. Father Pierre Riches, the \\"kind and elegant\\" Catholic priest whose hair had been stroked by Cavafy and whose photograph had been taken by Mapplethorpe. Billy Boy, the jewelry designer with 16,000 Barbies (who, tiring of them, invents a doll called Mdvany, a trendy Parisienne who \\"will not have unlined skirts like certain dolls we could name . . .\\". PIerre Guyotat, who wrote in a \\"strange subvocal language of his own devising, one that omitted vowels among other unnecessary luxuries.\\"<br /><br />And the places in Paris! How nice to live above a bookstore, especially one that revels in the splendidly punny name, Mona Lisait. To write at the Caf&eacute; Beaubourg, where the waiters will be equally attentive to you and your dog, and where the \\"tabletops were all painted by celebrated French artists but not signed lest they be stolen.\\" To wander the Marais with its delicatessens and seventeenth-century townhouses, its \\"Kiki Boys\\" and dogwalkers.<br /><br />If you have visited Paris, this book will bring back memories.  If you haven't, you may find yourself calling a travel agent!	2005-07-12

Beginning her research, she made a list of \\"Must See\\" sights, and realized that she'd missed most of them! She'd never been to the Statue of Liberty, or Wall Street, or the Stock Exchange. She'd been to the Cloisters once, many years before, never toured Rockefeller Center, never been to Grant's Tomb. So she enlisted her friend, Patsy Gibbs, and the two of them spent two months doing the things tourists do in New York City.<br /><br />However, this is not a guidebook. It's written from the point of view of a longtime resident, and is as much about the people as the sights. Hanff minces no words when she disapproves of something (the loss of Central Park land for additions to the Metropolitan Museum, the soullessness of theTrump Tower), but you'll be in no doubt about the things she loves, either (the Statue of Liberty, the skyline and so much else). The East Side/West Side split is analyzed and explained (\\"East Siders are conventional and proper, part of the Establishment and in awe of it -- which God knows, and God be thanked, West Siders are not.\\"). She revels in the city's diversity (\\"And you won't believe it, but on Allen Street there's a Kosher Chinese restaurant where the Chinese waiters wear yarmulkas.\\") She acknowledges the bloody history behind the fortunes (Frick, Morgan, Rockefeller) that nevertheless contributed so much to the ordinary people of the city, those whom John D. Rockefeller III called \\"the many\\".<br /><br />Times change and cities change, though, and it's amusing to read about the shocking \\"suggested contribution\\" at the Cloisters: $1.75. The Met and the Cloisters are now charging $15 (though one payment will get you in to both if you're crazy enough to try to see them on the same day), and the Museum of Modern Art wants $20 from you if you want to enter its lovely new building. The edition I read is, in fact, a later one, published in 1988, and Hanff notes a number of changes in several \\"P.S.\\" chapters. (Sadly, Gibbs had died of breast cancer several years before this edition.)<br /><br />Hanff admits it when she's wrong about something, too. She had gloomily predicted that damage to Central Park from a subway excavation would never be repaired. It was, with no scars.<br /><br />Even if you can walk to Zabar's in your sleep, you'll find something you didn't know about NYC in Hanff's book.a number of changes in several \\"P.S.\\" chapters.

Nick and partner Stefan Borowski head for a Caribbean Club Med to escape academic departmental politics. But, of course, it follows them there, and then there is a murder. Nick, who is a PI manqu&eacute;, naturally must investigate, especially as he and Stefan find the body and it appears that someone is trying to implicate him.<br /><br />Not one of Raphael's best. Too many of the characters are one-dimensional, with no clear motivations for their behavior. Plotlines appear and disappear with no resolution. The solution to the mystery comes out of left field, as the murderer, for no apparent reason, decides to divulge all to Nick and then flee. Even WITH a confession, there's no satisfactory motivation for the murder.<br /><br />And, Lev? While you may not care for Michael Cunningham's work, too much sniping at him in your book looks like professional jealousy. Tone it down.	2005-07-03

Ciccone does an excellent job not merely describing Royko's roots, but showing how that affected the person he became.<br /><br />Despite his brilliant writing, incisive political insights, and empathy for the ordinary Joe, Royko was a deeply troubled man. He was a severe alcoholic (as was his father before him), a workaholic who loved his family but was hardly ever around, a famous and successful columnist who was jealous of others and could hold a grudge like you wouldn't believe. When he remarried and started a second family (by adoption) after his first beloved wife's death, he spent more time on family things and tried to stop his self-destructive behavior, with limited success.<br /><br />Ciccone does not hide Royko's warts (and they were many), although he does become a bit of an apologist about his later, nastier side.<br /><br />Filled with anecdotes about Chicago's newspaper wars, sports teams (such as they are), its famous, infamous and not-famous-at-all, this will go on the shelf with all my other Chicagoana.<br /><br />One irritant, though. Ciccone is a newsman. He was managing editor for the Chicago Tribune and teaches journalism. Did he not read the proofs? Did his editor not read the proofs? Aside from such annoyances as the constant use of the word \\"anabuse\\" when he means \\"Antabuse\\", and calling Mike and his wife \\"the Royko's\\", Ciccone occasionally, gets repetitious, telling stories more than once in a way that makes it clear that he thinks he's saying it for the first time.<br /><br />But that's a minor quibble about an otherwise fine book.	2005-07-03

Writing in the first-person, from Marlowe's point of view, Welsh posits that Marlowe, having been \\"set up\\" by an envious actor at the behest of \\"powerful men\\", chooses death rather than implicate Raleigh in order, like Achilles, to gain everlasting fame.

(Got that? There will be a quiz.) Laura confesses, and Janeway thinks at first that she is protecting her autistic adopted son, Jerry. But then he thinks it might be someone else altogether. The investigation is not helped by the fact that the first cop on the scene left it unsecured, with resultant contamination, and tried to cover it up. Or by the fact that the client is pretty secretive.<br /><br />Janeway tangles with a dubious bookseller, a venal cop, and a reluctant client to come up with an unexpected (to him) solution.<br /><br />Far less irritating, and more realistic, than Dunning's last, though no defense lawyer worth her license would keep referring to a client as \\"our defendant\\". Jeez. I loved the character of Parley McNamara, the local lawyer. Janeway, and Erin, the hotshot Denver lawyer, both start out assuming he's a hack. Honey, no way.	2005-07-03

There's blood on her chest and face, and she feels sick. After throwing up watery rust-colored vomit, she realizes that lodged in her teeth is a piece of something that looks and smells like raw meat, which is really odd, because she's a vegetarian. Then she sees the news about a man's throat being ripped out by a killer dog.<br /><br />Annie isn't the only one who wonders what's going on. The New York branch of the Potenza family, an old werewolf clan now devoted to helping werewolves overcome their Lycanthropic Metamorphic Disorder (an inherited trait), worries about \\"free werewolves\\" and decides to track her down. So does Jim Valiente, a free werewolf who had been associated with Potenzas until the female werewolf he loved died during treatment.<br /><br />As the killings increase, the pressure on the Mayor and Police Commissioner to find the serial killer intensifies. So does the pressure on Sam Deverall, a TV news reporter who was on his way down until he got some inside information on the killings.<br /><br />After a bit, Annie doesn't know who to trust, Marco Potenza and his (completely) human wife, the male werewolf she had hot sex with in Central Park, the Potenzas' \\"enforcer\\"?<br /><br />Hayter has written a delightful fantasy of werewolves in New York, at the same time skewering all sorts of targets: media, politicians, mega-conglomerates, and artsy, pretentious twenty-somethings. Her characters are believable, and it is fun to watch the meek inherit the earth, so to speak, as some characters change and grow, and others get their comeuppance.<br /><br />If you are writing a werewolf novel, you have to deal with the fact that your protagonist is killing people and you have to find a way to make him sympathetic in spite of that fact. Hayter passes this test with flying colors. She also has a quite credible explanation for why Annie hadn't transformed earlier. A funny, sweet, romantic horror story.orror story. <br />	2005-07-03

Talk about your culture clash and your family secrets! Like many children of mixed cultural backgrounds, Carmit found it a bit difficult to fit into either. But it was more difficult because she was a minority within a minority, a dark-skinned, South Asian who \\"didn't look Jewish\\", and an Indian whose family had a different religion and different traditions from the Hindu majority. As a child, her grandmother makes her promise that she will always return to the Bene Israel, and she does.<br /><br />Her family history, too, set her apart. Her grandmother was betrothed to a man who turned out to be an alcoholic. This put an end to the engagement, but it also made her grandmother practically unmarriageable. Until her sister's husband offered to take her as his second wife. He treated her and her daughter very differently from the way he behaved towards his first wife, being abusive, forcing her to live in poverty while her sister lived in luxury. The family's condescension towards Nana-bai and her descendents continued into the author's generation.<br /><br />While I wasn't terribly impressed with the author's writing style (I thought she jumped around a lot, among other things), the book is well worth reading for an understanding of the difficulties of growing up in a multi-cultural household, of being \\"odd girl out\\", as well as to learn a little bit about this small, perhaps dying, segment of Judaism. I would, in fact, have liked to have learned more about Bene Israel, its history, how its practices differ from mainstream Judaism, but I guess that would be another book!	2005-07-03

The problem is that the footnotes aren't. I mean that they are not the type of footnotes that one ordinarily finds in a book. They are either far too long, or contain material that would ordinarily be in the main text, or digress so far off the subject that they would never be included. On top of which, the character is a bit too odd.<br /><br />What made Dunn's Ella Minnow Pea a delight was that he managed to make its odd premise seem perfectly natural.  But here, the story, like Procrustes' victims, seems to have been stretched and chopped to fit the concept.	2005-07-03

But I am truly glad I did.  Nothing at all like her Ballad series, except in its excellence, this book leaves the mountains and heads off to the NASCAR circuit, of all unexpected things!  McCrumb, to the great benefit of her readers, has been stretching herself of late.<br /><br />The first annual Dale Earnhardt Memorial Pilgrimage has attracted quite a variety of folks, from an Episcopal priest escorting a dying boy, a couple who marry at the first speedway, and a New York stockbroker, to a woman who thinks Dale's ghost fixed her car on a deserted country road. Their guide is a former NASCAR driver looking to get back in the game. As their bus wends it way from Bristol to Daytona, they, like certain more famous pilgrims, tell stories, and find out about each other and themselves.<br /><br />McCrumb's usual excellent characterizations, as she delves into the question of what makes a secular saint. Why are there Elvis sightings, and not John Lennon sightings? Why did so many people care when Princess Diana died? It was not her intent to write a book about Earnhardt; indeed, she was not a NASCAR fan. But the outpouring of grief at his death, his canonization as a secular saint, made him a good focus for the book had in mind on that subject. I don't know if she intended it or not, but she is also writing about class and regional prejudice in America.<br /><br />You don't need to be a NASCAR fan to enjoy this book, but it couldn't hurt.	2005-07-03

And, naturally, Claire announces the solution when all the suspects are gathered in one spot. And, naturally, she's right, even though there is no real evidence. I'm soooo tired of that sort of thing.<br /><br />Of course, I know authors have a hard time letting you get to know someone and then having that person be the murderer, but I am also tired of the culprit being some very fringe character who was barely around for the first 90% of the book.<br /><br />Craft's book is best when he is talking about the characters' relationships, and, boy, are there a bunch. All May-December, too! (So why can't I find a toy boy?)<br /><br />And I really enjoyed the fact that Claire is directing a production of Laura, a favorite of mine, though I'd far rather Craft describe the plot in a footnote than have the Claire say things about it to the actors and others who ought to know already. Here she is talking to one of the actors (who is also her lover): \\"And Scott's just wonderful as the effete Waldo Lydecker, a perfect foil to your hard-boiled but sensitive portrayal of Detective McPherson. Even Thad . . . [has] taken the minor role of Danny and polished it into one of the show's special highlights.\\" She sounds like a critic, not a director!<br /><br />Oh, and Mark Manning makes a guest appearance.	2005-02-18

(I hadn't read the cover blurb before I took a look at the copyright page to check the date of publication; it was a bit of a shock to see that the copyright is held by Gay Men's Health Crisis.) Woolley practically invented the \\"fantasy auction\\", those charity events where the bids are for items that will never again be available (my personal favorite example here is the opportunity to have David Hockney paint your swimming pool - not a painting of your pool, but painting the pool itself!).<br /><br />The politics and machinations of auctions and charity events are deftly described, though Woolley did not live to see the indictment of Diana Brooks and Alfred Taubman (both of whom he speaks highly of) on charges of price-fixing. He also writes of his own part in creating the concept of specialized auctions, and in bringing glamor to the world of auction houses.<br /><br />About his own life, Woolley speaks candidly. He was in a relationship for many years with Jeffrey Childs, who died of AIDS. Because the last several years were a marriage blanc, Woolley was HIV-negative, until he fell in love again. Attempting to engage in safe sex, he and his lover used the most expensive condoms available; unfortunately, these were lambskin, which does not protect against HIV.	2005-02-18

Unfortunately, his reliance on Prozac to help him deal with his depression is also making it difficult for him to put any life into his writing. When a freelance writer is murdered, Justice is asked to take over the project on which he had been working, a booklet about West Hollywood's historic and architecturally significant buildings. There is, naturally, a fight over certain of the buildings, between developers and preservationists. And when an ardent preservationist is also murdered, Justice gets involved.<br /><br />While I generally enjoy these books, I found myself a bit dissatisfied here. Some behaviors just didn't ring true, particularly with regard to journalist Alexandra Templeton (a continuing character). She is thinking about making the jump to television (and here Wilson indulges in some smacks at TV news, not entirely undeserved). To promote this, she allows herself to be used by a quack scientist, and in the process is ready to smear a murder suspect (on evidence that wouldn't get an arrest warrant in the real world, much less a conviction). And her sudden engagement in a lesbian relationship with the detective on the case made no sense; aside from the ethics of it, she's been straight in all the other books.<br /><br />There is also a thread in this book of \\"people looking for their fathers\\". It was so heavy-handed! Coincidences just hitting you over the head.<br /><br />And I am extremely tired of otherwise intelligent people doing incredibly stupid things - like waltzing out into the night knowing someone is out there waiting to jump them when they could just as easily have gone back where they'd been to get help. Oh, please.<br /><br />But I did enjoy reading about the history and architecture of West Hollywood.	2005-01-24

In this book, McCone continues to deal with her reaction to her brother's suicide, to her discovery of her own adoption and reunion with her birth family, and with changes in her relationship with her lover, Hy Ripinsky.<br /><br />A fast-paced and well-written book.	2005-01-24

He asked the court to appoint an attorney to represent him. The judge refused, telling Gideon that Florida only provided counsel in capital cases. So Gideon went to trial, representing himself, and was convicted.<br /><br />From the Florida State Prison in Raiford, in 1962, Clarence Earl Gideon wrote a letter to the United States Supreme Court, asking that his conviction be overturned on the grounds that he should have been given a lawyer. He was fighting an uphill battle. The Court had previously ruled in Betts v. Brady that the 6th Amendment right to counsel did not apply to the states. Gideon was asking the Court to change its mind, just twenty years later.<br /><br />The Court agreed to hear his case, and appointed Abe Fortas to brief and argue it. The rest is history. Gideon won his case (and at retrial, with counsel, was acquitted), and indigent criminal defendants are now guaranteed the right to counsel. 2003 marks the 40th anniversary of Gideon v. Wainwright, which is the foundation stone of indigent defense throughout the United States).<br /><br />Anthony Lewis was for many years the New York Times Supreme Court correspondent. His work covering the Court was knowledgeable and incisive. In this book, he explains clearly and simply the legal history that Gideon and Fortas had to face, and how this historic change came about.	2004-12-02

At the age of five, Mineko Iwasaki was sent by her parent's to an okiya, a geisha house, as the house's atatori, that is, the intended successor. She studied dance, and became very well-known. This is a very interesting description of the life and training of geiko, as the Kyoto geisha are known.<br /><br />At the age of twenty-nine, having inherited, she shut down the Iwasaki okiya. This was a rather disturbing action to me. The author describes her dissatisfaction with the way the \\"flower and willow world\\" was run, and her decision to close the house was intended to jolt the system. Of course, it did nothing of the kind. She does not say anything about what happened, following her action, to the people who were dependent on the house for their livelihood, and I found that omission disturbing.<br /><br />Having also read Arthur Golden's extremely popular Memoirs of a Geisha, I was intrigued by the differences between the two descriptions. But I don't know whether the differences are attributable to the different eras about which the two were writing (Iwasaki was born in 1949, Golden's book covers the period from just before to just after WWII), or if Golden was exercising \\"artistic license\\".	2004-12-02

Both were successful novelists - Highsmith had written the first of the Ripley novels, her Strangers on the Train had been filmed by Hitchcock, while Meaker was just breaking into hardcover. They fell in love. Meaker broke off with her lover to move to rural Pennsylvania (from New York City!) with Highsmith. They had two years together, before Meaker's jealousy (early on a friend had quoted Shakespeare to her as a warning: 'Trifles light as air / Are to the Jealous confirmations strong / As proofs of holy writ.\\") and Highsmith's alcoholism destroyed their relationship. In fact, despite a habit of remaining friends with old lovers, Meaker did not have contact with Highsmith for twenty-seven years after their breakup.<br /><br />Highsmith seems to have been a terribly insecure woman; she was restless, always wanting to be where she was not, doing her best writing in (and eventually moving permanently to) Europe. The casual racism and anti-Semitism she voiced when Meaker first knew her, while perhaps not so uncommon in the 50's, had grown into a vicious hatred of Jews by the time they reconnected nearly three decades later. She seems to have had a very difficult relationship with her mother, whom she actually stopped speaking to later in life.<br /><br />Meaker draws a compelling portrait of two writers, and how they tried, without ultimate success, to make a home and lives together. At one point, towards the end, Highsmith accuses Meaker of having imagined who she (H) was and being disappointed that she was someone else. Meaker admits the truth of this. While she has drawn Highsmith warts and all, she doesn't airbrush her own portrait, but gives us an honest account an affair that was likely doomed from the start.<br /><br />It is also an interesting portrait of urban gay/lesbian life in the 50's, when \\"you could still be fired for being a homosexual, or lose your lease, your straight friends, your family -- even in a big city like Manhattan, you were safer in the closet.\\" Even Highsmith and Meaker, whose families knew, if they did not accept, their lesbianism, and both of whom had published books about lesbians (Highsmith's The Price of Salt actually had the nerve to have a happy ending), felt guarded, out in the world.like Manhattan, you were safer in the closet.\\" Even Highsmith and Meaker, whose families knew, if they did not accept, their lesbianism, and both of whom had published books about lesbians (Highsmith's The Price of Salt actually had the nerve to have a happy ending), felt guarded, out in the world.	2004-12-02

When World War II broke out, her father suddenly announced that the family was leaving, and that they would be baptized as Catholics. Up to that point, the author had not even known that her family was Jewish.  From Prague, they fled to France, and then to Spain.<br /><br />Years later, after she was living in America, she learned that many Jews had fled to Spain during the Holocaust, but that most had not converted or hidden their Jewishness.<br /><br />As she began to trace her roots, she discovered the irony of Jews seeking protection in a country that, centuries before, and persecuted and expelled them.<br /><br />There are a couple of books here, fighting for supremacy!<br /><br />The first book is about how and why Spain opened its borders to Jewish refugees from the Holocaust.<br /><br />\\"The irrefutable fact remains that, although the presence of Jews placed the whole country at risk of being drawn into another ar or occupied by Hitler's forces, Fascist Spain, both officially and unofficially, accepted thousands of foreign Ashkenazic Jews within its borders and allowed them to remain until they were able to secure residence elsewhere.\\"<br /><br />Why? The question is probably unanswerable, though Alexy tries her best. Guilt over the expulsions of 1492? Maybe, but this does not account for the welcome to Ashkenazic, as well as Sephardic, Jews. Maybe Franco had Jewish ancestors? There's no proof of that. A political decision in case the Allies won? Perhaps, but in a country devastated economically by the Civil War, Spain gave much. One interesting suggestion is that because of the expulsion, and the concomitant absence of a Jewish population, Spain did not develop the kind of anti-Semitic attitudes seen in other European countries.<br /><br />Whatever the reason, the fact remains that thousands owe their lives to an official blind eye, and open Spanish arms.<br /><br />Alexy begins by explaining her quest, her need to understand her own family history that sent her to Spain, and to the New York archives of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (\\"the Joint\\"), the organization that was responsible for helping stateless Jewish refugees in Spain. She interviews several people who found, or whose parents found, a haven across the Pyrenees, and in the section called \\"The Rescuers\\" she writes of those, Jews and non-Jews, who provided the means to safety. People such as Lisa Fittko, who acted as a guide, and Ren&eacute;e Reichmann, who from Tangier arranged material support, and Spanish diplomats who told the Gestapo, \\"these are our Jews\\" and taught the children a few words of Spanish in case they should be challenged.<br /><br />The next two parts seemed to me as though they should be in a different book. \\"The Reformers\\" writes of present-day liberalization of Spanish laws and attitudes about non-Catholics (not merely Jews). It's interesting but although it touches on some theories as to why Spain helped, it is really more focused on the present and seems out of place.<br /><br />The same is true of the final section, about contemporary Marranos and other \\"secret Jews\\". This is a huge topic about which a whole book could, and should (and probably has, I'll have to look) be written. In fact, the subtitle of this book suggests that that's what it's about. But it isn't.<br /><br />Either this book should have been much longer, and made into a history of Spain and the Jews (and that would be a seriously long book!), or it should have been shorter, and the last two parts saved to become another book or books.<br /><br />But those are quibbles.

When a nasty, anonymous note is slipped into the sleeve of Harriet Vane's gown when she attends the Shrewsbury College Gaudy, she thinks it is a reference to her personal history. But it soon turns out that the animus is directed at the College, and Vane is asked to investigate. In the course of so doing, she begins to wonder if she should return to the scholarly life.<br /><br />Sayers' great strength as a mystery writer, particularly apparent in the Wimsey-Vane books, was her ability to write about relationships. The working out of Harriet and Peter's relationship is crucial to this book. It is not that the mystery is secondary; indeed, it is in the unraveling of that mystery that Harriet is able to confront her concerns about Peter and is also learns more about him than in all the time she knew him.<br /><br />But the crux of this book is the importance of intellectual honesty in the face of personal considerations, of the need to do work that matters to you. It is about women's struggle for a recognized place in the public realm, as well as the private.<br /><br />There are wonderful by-ways here as well. Harriet's life as a writer, both of mysteries and scholarly works, is described in fine detail, with the addition of a humorous description of the 30's London literary scene. Oxford itself, both town and gown, is a character in the book. How lovingly it is drawn!	2004-12-01

Walker (Lisa Drew Books (Paperback))	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A fine biography of a fascinating woman	Before I read this book, I knew Madam C.J. Walker must have been one tough cookie! And she certainly was. But her story is more than just \\"daughter of slaves makes good.\\"<br /><br />Madam Walker was orphaned at 7, and went to live with her sister and brother-in-law in what was apparently an abusive household. She married at 14 to escape the situation and, at 20, was left a widow, with a child to support. Leaving Mississippi for St. Louis, she began an extraordinary journey, one that would lead her not merely to wealth and fame, but to a position of influence and importance in the affairs of her race and her nation. She overcame obstacles of race, gender and class to found a business that would help give independence and financial stability to thousands of women. From the very beginning of her success, she used her money to help others, not merely through employment, but by setting an example of charitable giving that lasted throughout her life.<br /><br />As a woman rising from poverty, attempting to establish herself as a leader, she often met with resistance even in her own community (it took quite some time, for instance, for Booker T. Washington to acknowledge her as a leading businesswoman). But she persisted, and, even more to her credit, was able to walk a fine line between the supporters of Washington and those of W.E.B. DuBois, who took Washington to task as not aggressive enough in fighting for civil rights.<br /><br />I was fascinated by the section discussing Madam Walker's involvement in the efforts of the African-American community to have the issue of race placed on the table at the Versailles Peace Conference after World War I. This was a part of our history that I had not been aware of before reading this book. It does not surprise me that the government was spying on prominent African - Americans and community organizations (plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose!). And anyone, black or white, whom the government perceived as not being completely behind the official point of view was denied a passport to travel to the conference. The issue never came to the table.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as with a lot of strong, determined women, Madam Walker was not as successful in her choice of men (a difficulty her daughter also had!). But she did not hesitate to do what needed to be done in her personal life. Her daughter, Lelia (later A'Lelia), whom she raised with the usual mother-daughter conflicts, grew up to become an important part of the family business, though not an artist in any field herself, a key supporter of artists of the Harlem Renaissance.<br /><br />The author, A'Lelia Bundles, is her subject's great-great-great-granddaughter, and is a journalist.

While the book does spend a good bit of time on the story of William Adams, an English seaman who found himself marooned in Japan, it is really more a straightforward account of the attempts by the English and the Dutch to open Japan to trade.<br /><br />The rivalries between the two nations, and between the Protestant English and Dutch and the Catholic priests who were already in Japan, make up a good bit of the book. (When Adams arrived in Japan, he was in quite a bit of danger from the Jesuits, who feared that through him the shogun would discover that, contrary to what they had led him to believe, there was not \\"one Christian faith\\".) The alliances shifted, and often those of both nations who were tending to trade in the Far East, were caught up in events happening far away, as their countries made war or peace on each other thousands of miles away.<br /><br />Then, Japan enters the period of sakoku, closed country, and it will be a two centuries before it is again open to the West.<br /><br />There is a good deal of reliance on primary sources, though I could wish that the end notes were more specific.

When he is fifteen, his village is attacked and wiped out, but he is saved by Lord Otari Shigeru, who adopts him, renaming him Takeo.. At the same time, certain unusual abilities, heretofore latent in him, appear, and it is discovered that his true birth was to the Tribe, a people with preternatural hearing, the ability to split themselves in two, to become invisible. These skills have stood them in good stead as assassins. It is not the future Takeo envisions for himself, especially after he lays eyes on the beautiful Lady Shirakawa Kaede.<br /><br />He meets her as he is accompanying Shigeru, who is to marry her to cement an alliance between his clan, the Otori, and the Tohan clan, led by Iida Sadamu, the man who attacked Takeo's village and against whom he swore vengeance. Shigeru, for his part, is in love with Lady Murayama, who returns his love. He has agreed to marry Kaede in exchange for being allowed to adopt Takeo, and with the intent of using the marriage as a pretext for getting into Lord Iida's stronghold.<br /><br />Another lord, Arai, is massing an army to attack Iida's castle, and Takeo will use his skill to cross the nightingale floor in silence, and kill Iida. But things go badly awry when Takeo is kidnapped by members of the Tribe. Lady Murayama and her daughter are killed trying to escape the castle, Shigeru is captured and tortured and left to die.

She and Takeo consummate their love, and the citadel falls to Arai, but Takeo must leave Kaede and join the Tribe, in fulfillment of a promise.<br /><br />While set in an imaginary country, and with elements of fantasy, this book is nevertheless a beautifully written evocation of ancient Japan, its clan wars, its social structure, its arts, its religion.

(And maybe, just maybe, he is!)<br /><br />He works very hard to overcome Dennis' problems and to cope with his behavior. Things seem to be going well until an earthquake and the death of a beloved pet dog occur on the same day. Worse, they happen at a time when Dennis and Gerrold have been together almost two years, just about the time Dennis would have been moved from a placement, and this threatens to undo their relationship.<br /><br />It is Gerrold's recognition of this trigger and his understanding of how his son's mind works -- his real empathy -- that saves the day.	2004-11-30

But it's one that stifles Janie's soul, and she meets and runs off to Florida with Jody. Jody is a leader, a hard worker, a born politician, and helps build, and becomes mayor of, an all-black town in Florida. But he puts Janie in the background, and once again she is \\"sittin' on porches\\". When Jody dies, he leaves her well-off, but she \\"aint' grievin' so why do Ah hafta mourn?\\" And then Tea Cake comes to town, a dozen years younger, dark-skinned, a gambler, a roustabout, a migrant worker, and she is off to the Everglades with him to build \\"no race after property and titles.

They fight through jealousy, suspicion, hurricanes, illness.<br /><br />My edition of this book has an afterword by Henry Louis Gates, Jr., in which he quotes Hurston describing her dying mother: \\"Her mouth was slightly open, but her breathing took up so much of her strength that she could not talk. But she looked at me, or so I felt, to speak for her. She depended on me for a voice\\".<br /><br />I think, in some respects, that sums up this book. It's about choosing how your voice is heard, how the story of your life is told. And, oh, Hurston uses such language to tell it!

In September, 1924, Sir (or Mr. as he then was) Alister Hardy attended the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley. Having had a fascination for \\"flying machines\\" from an early age, he naturally took advantage of the opportunity to be taken up in a balloon. Much to his surprise, he discovered that the pilot was E.T. Willows, an early balloon pioneer and one of Hardy's childhood heroes.<br /><br />After an afternoon of spending half-crowns to remain in company and conversation with Willows, he determined to take advantage of an offer to cross London by balloon.<br /><br />One must delight in the way Hardy off-handedly remarks that he was in London \\"preparing for an expedition to the Antarctic in Scott's old ship The Discovery\\". He prevails upon two of his expedition colleagues and an old friend to join him. One of his companions, Neil Mackintosh, wrote a poem about their adventure, called \\"The Balloonatics\\", which is included.<br /><br />Hardy & friends soar up into the clouds over London, drifting westward, they lose their way. Coming down to enquire of their location, they \\"frighten unsuspecting pedestrians as their disembodied voices boomed out of the darkness.'\\" They end up in the Thames, and have further interesting adventures.<br /><br />Sir Alister turns out to have been quite an interesting figure, a marine biologist and zoologist, with some rather controversial ideas regarding evolution.	2004-11-30

Of course, it's not - and that's the point of this book. Albarelli, a non-Jew, taught for 5 years at a Hasidic yeshiva in Brooklyn. This is the story of that experience.<br /><br />I was really disappointed in this book. Stories of a goy teaching at a Hasidic yeshiva should be interesting! But Albarelli is all \\"me, me, me\\". He seems to have no interest in his students. (For instance, at one point, he is trying to teach the about slavery in the U.S. and the story of Harriet Tubman, but with little success. It seems never to have occurred to him to link that story with the Passover story!)<br /><br />He fails to give any background. The book begins with his answering a newspaper ad for an English teacher at a yeshiva. He describes the rabbi saying \\"Based on your background, I think you'll work out here. To be honest with you, public school teachers don't work out here.\\" Yet we are never told what Albarelli's background is, why he chose to answer this ad, nothing.<br /><br />To bracket this, at the end of the book, he says that he talked to his students about becoming a Jew (since it comes completely out of the blue, it's not credible). One student says \\"You not become a Jew\\". Albarelli says, \\"Do you know that?\\" and the student responds, \\"Okay, come to my house tonight.\\" This is never explained. Did he go? What is the connection that the student makes between Albarelli's expressed interest in conversion and what goes on at the student's home? Tell us!<br /><br />Albarelli describes the students as rude, noisy, inattentive, etc., but then says things improved, and notes that prospective teachers were sent to observe his class. Yet he never explains how he achieved a relationship with his students, nor does he discuss the cultural norms that would allow boys who live in a very strict environment to behave towards their teachers the way they did. More important, he doesn't seem to care. It makes me wonder why he stayed for five years.<br /><br />There is too much left out here.

Elizabethan and Jacobean political machinations were complex and dangerous, and Hunt describes them, and the consequences of ending up on the wrong side, quite well.<br /><br />Robbie Kerr (later Carr) is a young, rather unworldly, Scotsman, who catches the eye of Thomas Overbury, one of Cecil's spies. They form a liaison which will have dire consequences.<br /><br />The narrator, Giles Rawlins, a cousin of Overbury, tells the story of how Kerr, under Overbury's tutelage, learns the ways of the Court. But there is more that King James wishes to teach him, and he becomes James' favorite.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he also catches the eye of the spoiled daughter of the house of Howard, Frances Devereux, Countess of Essex, who through mommets and potions wins him as her lover, then wangles an annulment from her husband, on grounds of his impotence.<br /><br />But Overbury hates her, and threatens to reveal that she is no longer a virgin, which will put paid to the annulment. So Kerr (now Robert Carr, Viscount Rochester and Earl of Somerset) tricks him into offending the king, and Overbury lands in the Tower.<br /><br />It is Kerr's intent that this imprisonment last only until he and Frances are safely wed, but Frances has other plans. She wants Overbury gone, permanently.<br /><br />From what I have read of this period, Hunt is quite realistic in his description of court life, theatre, the period's interest in the occult, and other matters. It's lovely to read a novel that quotes John Donne, Ben Jonson and others in an appropriate context. (Donne did, in fact, write an Eclogue and Epithalamion on the occasion of Carr's marriage to Frances Howard).<br /><br />I must admit that I find it unlikely that Carr was the naïf that Hunt presents him as, but I suppose it's possible.	2004-11-30

When a library disappears, or a book-shop closes down, when a book is consigned to oblivion, those of us who know this place, its guardians, make sure that it gets here. In this place, books no longer remembered by anyone, books that are lost in time, live forever, waiting for the day when they will reach a new reader's hands.

It is The Shadow of the Wind, by Juli&aacute;n Carax, and once Daniel reads it, he will begin a search for Carax's other work. But he will discover that someone else is also engaged in that search, and is systematically destroying every copy of Carax's books that can be found.<br /><br />As the years pass, Daniel's life begins to parallel Carax's and intertwine with it, as he unravels a mystery that reaches back to the days before and during the Spanish Civil War, and finds love, friendship and betrayal.<br /><br />A tightly-woven and intricate plot, realistic and psychologically complex characters, beautiful language, romance, passion, and mystery all add up to a book that is difficult to put down.<br /><br />Here's hoping that more of Zaf&oacute;n's work gets translated into English.	2004-11-29

Mercedes Lackey wrote a poem (a not-very-good one) about a wizard who settles in a village where the previous wizard has died. She begins to sense his presence in the house where he lived (and she lives now). In the end, she is faced with a choice of laying his soul, or bringing him back to life.<br /><br />The conceit of this book is to have several authors use this theme as a jumping off point for their stories. It's an intriguing idea, but it doesn't work. The primary reason for this is, I think, that rather than use the story as inspiration, the authors simply put flesh on its bones. They don't use their own creative powers (assuming they have any) to make something unique and different of it. As a result, it's all much of a muchness and ultimately boring.<br /><br />The other difficulty I had with it is the same difficulty that I have with much current fantasy writing. Many writers of this kind think that putting together a hash of various mythologies along with invented names that have no linguistic similarities are all you need. It's all very unsatisfying.<br /><br />Having been introduced to fantasy via masters such as Lord Dunsany and Arthur Machen, I have no patience for this sort of thing.	2004-11-29

So she tried to put all three together, and doesn't quite pull it off, resulting in an uneven quality to the book.<br /><br />Despite the \\"Dysfunctional Family Tree\\" at the start of the book, which was amusing, those parts of the book were the least interesting, and seemed almost tacked on. I would very much have liked to have had more about her experiences at the News & Observer, and the exploits of the Ten Thousand Angels Committee (four women looking for men for themselves and each other) were pretty funny.<br /><br />She's a good writer, but she needed someone to force her to choose among three good themes.	2004-11-29

Instead, she focuses on alternating stories of real historical characters with stories of people in the present attempting to connect with the past.<br /><br />A group of Civil War re-enactors are playing at war, and Sheriff Spencer Arrowood, a recurring character in McCrumb's book, learns, to his surprise, that an Arrowood was killed in a battle that occurred after the war officially ended, and that he was a Union soldier.<br /><br />The historical story lines are fascinating, and led me to do more research on the people. Zebulon Vance was a self-made man, lawyer and Congressman. Though he argued against secession, when war came, he became a Confederate officer, later becoming the Confederate governor of North Carolina and was a strong voice for the people of Appalachia. After the war, he eventually became Governor again, and ended his career in the United States Senate.<br /><br />The other story is even more interesting. McKesson (Keith) Blalock was a Union sympathizer, but in Confederate North Carolina he was likely to be conscripted into the army. He enlisted, planning to desert and join the federal forces. But he didn't reckon that his troop's movements would make that difficult. He also didn't reckon on his wife, Malinda, following him, disguised as a man. The two eventually concoct a scheme to be discharged, and return home but Blalock's sympathies were known, and they were in danger. In time, both fled to the mountains, spending the war as guerrillas. This story, told through Malinda's voice, tells a side of the war that isn't taught much, where neighbor killed neighbor and relative killed relative.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in the present, the re-enactors have, unintentionally, conjured up ghosts, ghosts who have ridden before, and who are seen by the likes of Nora Bonesteel and Rattler, who have the Sight, and by those who are dying. The veil between past and present is rent.<br /><br />McCrumb has a real feel for language, and for getting into the skin of her characters. Malinda, particularly, struck me as being deeply understood. A lesser writer might have been tempted to draw her as an anachronism, to make her a \\"modern\\" woman, which would be terribly wrong. McCrumb respects her. She's a woman of her time and place, and, though unusual for that time and place, she was not unique.<br /><br />Not an easy book to put down, though I admit to stopping now and again to do a bit of research into the characters and historical events McCrumb's writing about.

Thanks to levees on the Mississippi, oil company canals, and other interference with nature, coastal Louisiana is losing land the size of Manhattan every year. The land is sinking, the barrier islands disappearing, and with them go protection against hurricanes, resting places for migratory birds, and a seafood-rich ecosystem.<br /><br />That it is possible to halt the destruction of this habitat is known.

Yes, it certainly is.<br /><br />This is a Benjamin Justice novel, and Ben is going through his usual angst. He's broken up with his last partner, and is coping with his HIV meds, while trying to write his autobiography. He decides that he needs to track down the whereabouts of the priest who molested him when he was twelve years old. Though he discovers the man has since died, he also discovers that there were more victims. Then a reporter who is helping his investigate, and who writes a column about priest molestations, is murdered, and it looks like the Archdiocese, which tries to bribe Justice into silence about the priest, itself may be involved.<br /><br />With Wilson, there is no black-and-white, only shades of grey. Even a vicious killer's back story hints at some reasons for sympathy. Justice struggles with his history, feeling guilt for things he did (and didn't do) as a child that are affecting the present. In what will surely offend some people, pure evil here is confined to the hierarchy of the Catholic church. It is not only the molestations and the cover-ups, which could be taken from any headline, but the total lack of empathy and caring, the hypocrisy, that makes these men evil. This is one of the darkest of a dark series.<br /><br />And well worth reading.	2004-11-29

The book is illustrated with his drawings.<br /><br />His ideas about influences on art are insightful. as he describes early photographers \\"inspired by the paintings of Delacroix and Ingres\\", to his thought that Bacon \\"clearly derives from the Polaroid\\". I was intrigued by his suggestion that the use of industrial paints in American art occurred because of poor artists used cold-water flats as studios, \\"and to make them livable they had to scrape and paint the walls, doors and windows, and floors . . . and this led them to work on a large scale, to use industrial paints, such as gold or silver on radiators, new materials\\". His description of the New York City taxi cab of the `40's as created out of Cubist elements, of the automobile influenced by Constructivism, Cubism, and \\"Fernandl&eacute;gerism\\" makes one look at cars in a whole new light.<br /><br />The title, Reflections and Shadows, comes from a section in which he discusses how what one sees in reverse in a reflection (in a mirror, in water) or shadow is often better - sharper, more intense - than the original. \\"If you look only at the reflection, and not at the reflecting part, you see a gratuitous reality that exists for you alone.

In the process, he met Gersh, whom he would also explore and embrace ;-)) (sorry, irresistable!).<br /><br />In an excellent essay, \\"Empty Memory? Gays in Holocaust Literature\\", Raphael addresses the question of gays in Nazi Germany, and has it right, I think, when he says that it is wrong to ignore or belittle the persecution of gays, but that it is also wrong, and historically inaccurate, to not understand the difference between the treatment of gays and the treatment of Jews, and the policy differences between them.<br /><br />He does not allow himself, however, to separate his Jewishness and his gayness. He mentions speaking at a Jewish community center, along with a lesbian who is also the child of survivors, and being asked by other children of survivors why they \\"had to be gay\\" that evening!

As Jews we know what it sounds and feels and smells and tastes like. \\" When, at Yad Vashem's Hall of Remembrance, a ceremony to remember the gay and lesbian Jews who died in the Holocaust is interrupted by right-wing demonstrators calling the group \\"evil\\" and accusing them of blasphemy, this is no less hatred than the the demonization of Jews as Christ-killers, and the anti-Semitism of the Pat Buchanans of the world.<br /><br />Not everything is this book is so intense, though. \\"Okemos, Michigan\\" is a heart-warming essay, describing how he and Gersh bought a house together, and how the house became a home.

It starts out in the present tense, a conceit that I generally dislike. However, it soon changes, as the author alternates tenses to differentiate between the narration of past and present events. And then it works.<br /><br />The story is of a forty-ish school teacher who has an affair with one of her students, and is told by a sixty-ish school teacher who has befriended her. As the book starts, the affair has already been discovered and Sheba is out on bail pending trial, living in her brother's home with her friend Barbara. Barbara is writing a journal about the events and her relationship with Sheba, and that is how the story unfolds.<br /><br />All of Heller's characters are realistic, from the inarticulate 15-year-old with a crush on his teacher, to the teacher herself, new at the job, anxious to do good and make good, to her rebellious teen-aged daughter, to the pompous headmaster and the spinster friend. It is the character of Barbara, however, who is most interesting, despite the rather stereotypical \\"repressed lesbian spinster with cat\\" image. She is very clever, dead on with her analysis of other people and their actions, yet totally oblivious to her own inappropriate behavior and full of self-justification. She is at once sympathetic, and not sympathetic, a very neat stunt to pull off!<br /><br />The same is true of Sheba. The knee-jerk reaction is to think, well, she should have known better than to have it off with a student. But the situation is far more complicated than that. As Barbara muses, \\"The sorts of young people who become involved in this kind of imbroglio are usually pretty wily about sexual matters. I don't mean just that they're sexually experienced -- although that is often the case. I mean that they possess some instinct, some natural talent, for sexual power play. For various reasons, our society has chosen to classify people under the age of sixteen as children. In most of the rest of the world, boys and girls are understood to become adults somewhere around the age of twelve. . .We may have very good reasons for choosing to prolong the privileges and protections of childhood. But at least let us acknowledge what we are up against when attempting to enforce that extension. Connolly was officially a minor, and Sheba's actions were, officially speaking, exploitative; yet any honest assessment of their relationship would have to acknowledge not only that Connolly was acting of his own volition but that he actually wielded more power in the relationship than Sheba.\\" That is often the case.<br /><br />A very good read.most of the rest of the world, boys and girls are understood to become adults somewhere around the age of twelve. . .We may have very good reasons for choosing to prolong the privileges and protections of childhood.

Among other things, she wrote about the shortcomings of the Chicago Public School system. Then she decided to put her money where her mouth was (quite literally, she took a two-thirds pay cut), signed on for an alternative teacher certification program, and began teaching in an inner-city grade school.<br /><br />I admit I was skeptical at first. After all, here was someone who'd been telling the schools what to do from her journalist's ivory tower, probably thought she knew it all, and could cut and run back to her well-paying career if teaching went sour. Well, she didn't. She's still teaching.<br /><br />All those folks who think teachers should be paid according to how test scores improve, who blame the teachers because kids can't read or are uncontrollable, need to read this book. It's been said before, but it needs to be heard.<br /><br />You try it. Take a class of 36 kids, some of whom are homeless, or live in a home with crack addicts, who don't get enough to eat (except at school). Don't have supplies except what you buy yourself. Have the room be too hot in summer and too cold in winter. Do this in a school where the administration doesn't care about whether kids learn as long as they're quiet. Be downgraded for initiative. Teach to the test. Spend your free time and weekends grading and making lesson plans. Never get what you need until it's too late. Don't forget to learn all the different gang signals, and be sure to duck when there's shooting outside the classroom window. Get paid $24,000. Then talk about it.<br /><br />It amazes me anyone is still teaching. But then there are folks like Baldacci, and the teacher named Donna who asked her why she took a two-thirds pay cut.<br /><br />\\"Because a voice called and I answered,\\" I told her. It was the first time I'd admitted that out loud to anyone outside my family and a few close friends. Although I did not know her well, I felt she would understand. She jerked her head and looked at me in surprise. Then a smile spread across her face.<br /><br />\\"My sister,\\" she greeted me, as if meeting me for the first time. \\"t know her well, I felt she would understand.

This novel is based on the true story of Mary Ingles, a white settler in Virginia in 1755. When her settlement was attacked by Indians, a pregnant Ingles, along with her two children, her sister-in-law, and a male settler, was kidnapped, and taken far from home. She was ultimately able to escape from captivity, though to do so she had to abandon her children. This describes her journey along the Ohio River, accompanied by another, half-mad woman captive.<br /><br />The plot was an interesting one, though I do think the book could have used some substantial editing. I realize that it was based on a true story, but it did seem that once the protagonist escaped and set out on her journey it became very repetitive, with similar types of incidents and reactions recurring, so that it became a bit predictable.<br /><br />I did like very much that the author didn't end the book with her character's return, but jumped ahead in years to tell us what happened to the people later on. Since we know the book is based on a true story, we're naturally curious, and it's good to be told in the context of the novel.	2004-11-29

These are the years of What Maisie Knew, The Spoils of Poynton, The Awkward Age.<br /><br />It is a dangerous thing to write a novel which is a psychological portrait of Henry James, the great master of the psychological novel. T&oacute;ib&iacute;n succeeds wonderfully, avoiding the temptation to imitate James' style. (There is quite an amusing passage when Henry's elder brother, William, tries to tell him what he should write about and how. \\"Harry, I find I have to read innumerable sentences you now write twice over to see what they could possibly mean.\\"<br /><br />He has also shunned any sort of plot, preferring instead to simply give us a picture of James through his own thoughts, memories and actions. It is a complex picture, and ultimately a sad one.<br /><br />James was an observer of life, more than a participant in its passions, yet T&oacute;ib&iacute;n shows us the undercurrents. His James is not the repressed New Englander so often described, but more a man who, while having emotions, and recognizing them, cannot allow himself to be vulnerable to them. As a result, he may appear cold and unfeeling,. Indeed, when he is accused by his old friend, Oliver Wendell Holmes, of failing to take their friend, Minny Temple, to Italy, an act which might have mitigated the TB that killed her, he has to hunt up her old letters to see if she really did ask him to do that.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with James' work will recognize those moments and ideas which will eventually be transmuted into various stories and novels. (It is, in fact, rather fun to say to oneself, \\"Aha! Turn of the Screw! \\") T&oacute;ib&iacute;n frequently alludes to the way in which all is grist to the writer's mill. It is not only James, of course. Describing James' trip to Venice after the suicide of his friend, the novelist Constance Fenimore Woolson, he writes: \\"This, he thought, was her last novel. They all played their assigned roles. He watched as the American women stood in her bedroom afraid to approach the window to the small balcony from which she had jumped. Constance would have been able to conjure up their stricken faces and would have known, too, that Henry James would have studied the women, observing them with cold sympathy. She would have smiled to herself at his ability to keep his own feeling a a great distance from himself, careful to say nothing. Thus the scene taking place in this room, each breath they took, the very expresssions on their faces, each word they left said and unsaid, all of it belonged to Constance. It was pictured by her with wry interest during the time when she knew she would die, Henry believed. They were her characters; she had written the script for them. And she knew that Henry would recognize her art in these scenes. His very recognition was part of her dream. No matter where he looked or what he thought, he felt the sharpness of her plans and a sort of sad laughter at how easy it was to manipulate her sister and her niece and how delicious to direct the actions of her friend the novelist who, it seemed, had wished to be free of her. \\"<br /><br />Oscar Wilde is introduced as a counter-point to James, the man who indulged his passions juxtaposed with the man who refused them. As Wilde's triumphant dramatic career turns to ashes, James observes it in a detached, yet sympathetic, manner. T&oacute;ib&iacute;n does not shirk the issue of James' sexuality (which, whatever his inclinations, he seems not to have indulged), and there is much homoeroticism here. James clearly recognizes his feelings (of a night spent platonically sharing a bed with Holmes, he \\" wondered if he would ever again be so intensely alive\\"). But he cannot give in to them.<br /><br />T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's James is a man who prefers to look on, sympathetically, ironically, indulgently, analytically, but alone and in control. At the end, his brother and his family having left after a visit, James returns home. \\"Lamb House was his again. He moved around it relishing the silence and the emptiness. He welcomed the Scot, who was waiting for him to begin a day's work, but he needed more time alone first. He walked up and down the stairs, going into the rooms as though they, too, in how they yielded to him, belonged to an unrecoverable past, and would join the room with the tasseled tablecloths and the screens and the shadowed corners, and all the other rooms from whose windows he had observed the world, so that they could be remembered and captured and held.\\"visit, James returns home. \\"Lamb House was his again.

There is little of Caleb until the end. Thinnes is reacting badly to his new partner, and discovers that his wife has been keeping a secret. There is an absurd ending. The title of the book has no connection that I can see with the plot or the characters.<br /><br />It's been several years since the last Caleb/Thinnes book.

To understand the importance of the Triangle Waist Company fire in labor history, it is also important to understand the context in which it occurred. I hadn't realized how the rise and fall of Tammany Hall was so intimately tied in with a business and political climate that would permit a situation in which such a deadly fire could occur, and also with the reformist aftermath, which was instrumental in leading to New Deal policies. The story of the trial, and the political maneuvering leading up to it, was fascinating.<br /><br />Von Drehle is a fine writer. The most moving chapter must be the one he calls, \\"Three Minutes\\", referring to the fact that had the alarm been sounded three minutes sooner, many lives might have been saved. His descriptions of how many of the workers died had me in tears. While it is very easy to pile horror on horror, von Drehle shows you the people, both the survivors and the lost. There is one extraordinary section of this chapter in which, after telling of the people standing in the windows \\"cry[ing] 'fire!' because what else was there to say?\\", and the fire ladders not tall enough, and the watchers below \\"their tiny hands . . . up, as if a gesture could hold the doomed workers forever in the mouth of a furnace\\" he then describes the view from the windows. \\"[T]he cool, clear air beyond the furnace; the gray-brown tracery of bare trees quilting Washington Square (faintly washed with the first whisper of new green) . . .the birds starting from nearby eaves and wheeling through the sky; the elegant campanile of the church on the square, and the pleasing aesthetic echoes of it in the two orange brick loft building that faced the Asch Building . . .one of the least decorated in the neighborhood, [it] featured miniature terra-cotta columns, fluted in the classical style, as dividers between the upper-floor windows.

It gives a view of the Palestinian situation that we do not often see in the U.S.  Any ambivalence I feel about this work must be put down to the ambivalence I feel about the political situation, where both sides are right and both sides are wrong, both have justice on their side and both act and feel unjustly towards the other. One would like to have hope, but it is difficult.<br /><br />What is it like to lose your land, to have your home bulldozed, your olive trees uprooted, your livelihood taken away, your children killed? Can we even imagine?<br /><br />Sacco does not pretend to have a solution, and, although the book focuses on the Palestinian point of view, he is clear-eyed enough to distrust easy sloganeering.<br /><br />I was struck by a number of parallels to the United States. For example, there is a section where Sacco meets members of the Palestinian Federation of Women's Action Committees. In the course of that discussion, one woman says, \\"If we get a state, do we retreat back to the way things were, or do we change things? Will economic development be considered priority and women's issues left behind?\\" The whole question of where the women's movement fits into a movement for radical social change is one that all social revolutions have faced.<br /><br />The organizations within the refugee camps, teaching children, making sure food is equitably shared, reminded me of the Black Panther Party's free breakfast programs and other social programs. The behavior of the Israeli soldiers reminded me in many ways of the behavior of police in this country in the ghettos. \\"I'm numbed by so many accounts of incarceration that the sort of thing that raises my brow is a male in his mid-20's who hasn't been arrested . . .\\"  I could not read that without thinking of the number of black men in this country who are under the control of our criminal \\"justice\\" system.<br /><br />You will, perhaps, when you read about \\"moderate pressure\\" be reminded of the current scandal of Abu Ghraib, and understand why it is not credible that it was not policy.<br /><br />A difficult, but necessary, book.t thinking of the number of black men in this country who are under the control of our criminal \\"justice\\" system.  <br /> <br />You will, perhaps, when you read about \\"moderate pressure\\" be reminded of the current scandal of Abu Ghraib, and understand why it is not credible that it was not policy. <br /> <br />A difficult, but necessary, book.	2004-11-29
