US	44495125	R2D8TAO87UCKLX	0441569595	769194143	Neuromancer	Books	4	3	8	N	N	Importent book, but not always interesting	It took me a while to get to this book but finally I got around to read it, it's definitely a very ground breaking book in both his vision of the future and perception of the internet even though it was written way before the internet took such a massive part of our life. It's interesting to see how terms that were invented as science fiction are starting to have a functional use in our like such as \\"cyberspace\\".<br /><br />What I also love about this book is that urban feeling, that type of sleazy dark high tec cities that always crawling with passion, crime and action. I just moved back to the city after 10 month in the suburbs and reading this book at this point in my life reminded me why I hated the suburbs so much, it made me feel very connected to the whole city experience and to living in this post modern world.<br /><br />What's a bit of a pity for me is that Gibson's incredible perception about cities and technologies doesn't transfer to the way he wrote about people, and so the characters are really shallow and not very interesting, their emotional progress through the book's pretty non existing and they are basically very caricature images of cinematic super heroes, villains and outlaws. It could be that the reason I felt it to be so was that those character was quoted in so many other movies an books (Matrix, Bland runner, Ghost in the shell and so on) so that by the time I got to reading their origin they seemed flat and boring, but basically I couldn't find them believable or interesting in any way, I wasn't sad when some of them died or hurt, and that for me is a little turn off in a book.<br /><br />All and all I enjoyed it a lot and the experience of living for a few weeks (and maybe more) in William Gibson's city was a very profound and interesting experience.	2005-05-02

However this book changed my mind, i wouldn't change a word or leave a chapter out of it, even though it is very long.<br /><br />It felt at time that this book was written especially for me, since it combined 3 genres I love - Jane Austin period novel, fantasy that's involves a twisted version of this world, like Phillip Pullman's \\"his dark material\\" or harry potter and books about magic, like \\"the history of magic\\" by Alihpas Levy or \\"the book or black magic\\" by Edward White (in parts of it it was even a book of magic, but you'll have to read the first few chapters to know what the difference is between books of magic and books about magic).<br /><br />I loved the pace of it, the way the plot very slowly develops over time, the way that though most of the character aren't very likable and all have many faults, you do get very attached through reading, Sussana clarke sense of humor and wit made me burst in laughter in very strange public places and i got very observed in reading.<br /><br />My test of a good book's what left with me after the plot's done, and I think this book showed me a few very interesting point concerning being a magician, being honest and finding a person's original way through life and his \ her art.<br /><br />This addition's very beautiful it's probably one of the most handsome books i own, the design's minimalist and pretty, the paper's really superb and the uneven pages cut's amazing, however since i read mostly on the bus, it was quite a load to carry for a month and a half and nothing else fits in my backpack. However, it was so worth it!	2005-03-15

I ordered the book and was really really excited to unexpectedly fall on such a gem.<br /><br />The book itself is large, very good prints and quality of the entire production is superb, but non of it would be fun if it weren't for krider's wonderful style and deep understanding and research into his fetish, which is motel rooms - the whole style's very cinematic, a lot of the shots look as if they are freeze frames of motion, and though the pose are very constructed ,they are built to represent a scenario.<br /><br />The photo reflect that motel feeling of danger, excitement and temporary environment, the models and room have a very vintage feel about them, and the lighting is again, very cinematic.<br /><br />Another added bonus, for me, was a wonderful preface written by Eric Kroll, which i admire, the connection between the two both in relation to fetish and to photography's very evident and so, it was nice to have one of them comment on the works of the other.	2004-12-08

Closing the Intimacy Gap Between Men and Women	Books	5	15	15	N	N	deep, interesting and yet easy to read	Like many people, i got to this book trying to solve a relational crisis, but this book gave me a lot more then just relationship tips and ways to solve interaction problem. I bought it based on people response and mostly, cause the title reflected exactly the way i was feeling within my relationship. And what this gave me was answers to many of the question me and my partner were living though, like why women and men are so different, how does our relationship with our parents effect the relationship and how does it all fit within a cultural context.<br /><br />What i liked mostly about this book is that it doesn't separate psychology from other fields in life in personal understanding - such as sociology, philosophy and even movies and myths. It's very deep and bring many examples that are easy to identify with. It doesn't just scratch the surface of understanding, it goes real deep into the history of a person and the social expectation they face in order to understand how our minds, and more then that - how does our emotion work and react.<br /><br />Most of all, for me, the main importance of this book was learning the see the gap that's happened within my relationship as something that can be bridges, and knowing that in order to do that, both me and my partner would have to change.<br /><br />This is not a self help book, most of all it gives you a deep understanding on where your problems stem from, not an east 12 (or 11 or 8) steps program of how to solve them. Personally, this book helped me to seek couple therapy and give an 8 year relationship another very honest shot.	2004-11-22

I love those type of 50's and 60's porn, and so i thought it would appeal to me both on the turn on level and a philosophical and artistically level (which is what i usually look for in erotic photography), the cover photo looked promising as well.<br /><br />I was fairly disappointed, this book has loads of material in it, but the quality of scans and print is really bad, some of the photos looks as if they were downloaded from the net or scanned in a low resolutions on a home scanner, and they are small and unaranged on the page and within the book, the book's pretty small, and those big white frames make it some of the photos seem like passport photos on a black page. The white and black balance are really bad in some of it.<br /><br />I know this is archives material and that probably parts of this collection weren't it the bast state to begin with, but really - that doesn't justify such an amateur production.<br /><br />I still recommend it, since it a very wide collection and the story behind it is fascinating to me, but if you are just looking for cool turn on photos from the 50's and 60's there are some much better books.	2004-10-14

Tough both emotional in both seeking love and addressing it, one lets her emotions take over just about everything else, and the other have better balance between love and logic.<br />I'm not much of a period novel fan, and didn't like the emma tompson movie so much -  so i wasn't too keen on reading this book at first, but as i got into the pace of the story, i enjoyed reading it. what i mostly liked about this book is the fact that though it was written a few centuries ago, the emotions describe in it, and the moral this story tells are still very true till today. the way we all need to balance our inner world with consideration and respect for the outer world.<br />I've been helping two friends through a pretty messy break up while i was reading this book, and i kept quoting parts of it for them, trying to explain how the choice between &quot;being a marrianne&quot; and &quot;being an elinor&quot; is their's and how dealing with grief and lose might be effected by their own approach to love and life in general.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who ever suffered from a broken heart and had to deal with a break up.

And you are familiar with pullman \\"can't put the book down\\" writing, and already attached to the well known and loved characters.<br />This book happens 2 years after the ending if the last one, sally has grown more and matured, as well as her business and her place in life, she made a few more friends, and life seem prefect - until in a brief moment, everything seem to collapse.<br />What i love mostly about the book and the entire series, except of the intriguing plot, is pullman's ability to examine \\"serious\\" social issues and combine them in the story. In \\"ruby in the smoke\\" it was a lot about the politics of drugs, in the \\" shadow in the north\\" it was about classes and weapons, and in this one is about the pre-word war Jewish immigration and socialism vs. capitalism. it examine the writers opinions without being to preachy and showing some ways of thinking without being to confusing.<br />I also enjoy pullman's level of research and his many reference to actual London the way it was in the Victorian period, i was reading this book with my sister who just spend a while in London and it was really nice to check if she knows those places today and in what ways have the different part of the city changed.<br />It's a slightly creepier book and scarier and probably fit for a bit older crowed then the first and second book. I'm 28 and some part of it gave me the chills, so other then young kids, i recommend it highly.	2004-04-22

O's anonimisity (you almost never hear of her emotions and feeling and sensation, only an outside report of the things that are done to her) made me see the O that is in me, as i read the book i became her, it was a very intence reading experience.<br />i find it still very stimulating book to read, on a physical as well as an intelectual level, i think that everyone who's interested in SM fiction, or just looking to read a really profound book should read this.	2003-05-22
