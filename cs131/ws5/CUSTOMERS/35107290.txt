She begins by finding fault with other theological treatments of economics and suggesting that money and grace are formaly related.  She notes also that the attainment of goods is not a zero-sum proposition.  She then suggests that a theological economy of gift should include the concepts of unconditional giving, universal giving, and non-competition within the community.  This stands in contrast with critiques of capitalism offered by a reading of Locke or gift-exchange theorists.  Finally, Tanner suggests practical ways that a theological economy can change the global capitalist economy.<br /><br />With thorough arguments, Tanner presents an excellent alternative to the current system.  Not only that, but she gives concrete steps to make this system relevant.  This book should be required reading for those interested in Christian theology and economics.	2005-09-16

He begins by outlining four components of the context of theology.  He then treats four characteristics of a theologian.  After that, four threats to theology are listed.  Finally, four essential components of theological work are listed.  Central to the work are Spirit, faith, hope, and love, the final components of each section. <br /> <br />As one would expect, central elements of Barthian theology are present.  The Word of God and the community of faith are central to the theological endeavor.  God is the ultimate object of theology, rather than humanity. <br /> <br />This is an excellent introduction to Barth.  It is also a good way to begin theological exploration.	2005-09-16

This serves to counter-balance prodominantly masculine metaphors received from classical tradition.  The term Sophia is particularly important. <br /> <br />Johnson explores this topic in four sections.  First, she discusses the importance of speech about God and the impact of a feminist perspective.  Second, she outlines three resources from which to draw feminine metaphors: women's experience, Scripture, and classical theology.  Third, she articulates her understanding of the persons of the Trinity, beginning with the Spirit.  Finally, she turns attention to the unity of God and God's suffering. <br /> <br />This book should be required reading for all men interested in theology.  We must be aware of the importance of our speech about God.  I have only two concerns.  First, although Johnson does not seek to eliminate masculine metaphors for God, she avoids them totally in her book.  This creates a tension between two equally exclusive forms of speech.  Second, the experience of women is important in the book.  This is only a problem if we allow experience to alter the way we understand God rather than allowing our understanding of God to illumine our experience.  Johnson comes closer to the former. <br /> <br />This is a thought provoking book.  It should be read by all interested in speaking of God faithfully.	2005-09-13

Dr. Placher has put together a collection of essays by 18 distinguished scholars.  Nine important issues are discussed.  Each section begins with a helpful introduction by Dr. Placher which serves to frame the discussion.  Then two authors with different perspectives present their thoughts on the topic.  At the end of each chapter are questions for discussion and a list of additional resources. <br /> <br />This book could serve as an excellent launching pad for further research in any of these areas.  The great thing about the book is that it is not set up in an \\"us\\" versus \\"them\\" way.  The authors don't set themselves up on the opposite sides of issues.  Rather, each presents his or her own views in a non-confrontational way.  By reading two perspectives on an issue, more of the nuance of the topic shows through.  This is a wonderful resource.	2005-08-27

Due to many different factors, the faiths of the world are colliding more now than ever.  Moreover, they are coming into conflict not only in the internationl arena, but also down the block and within families.  There are many ways to deal with the issue of pluralism, ranging from isolation and hostility to relativism.  Dr. Marty suggests that we address civic pluralism by offering hospitality to the stranger.  Rather than tolerance, where the \\"belonger\\" retains power over the \\"stranger,\\" hospitality forces people of faith to risk opening themselves to the other. <br /> <br />This book is wonderful first step.  It does not argue for a utopian pipedream, but rather a practical means through which we can get along.  Through hospitality we will find that faiths do not lose their distinctiveness, but are strengthened by both external and internal critique.	2005-08-25

The common strand is that they all seek to resituate the contemporary situation within a proper theological framework.  All other thinking is subordinate to theology.  To show this, the authors deal with subjects such as knowledge, nihilism, erotics, aesthetics, etc., putting them in theological context.  Some of the essays are better than others.  All seek to counter both nihilism and Enlightenment thinking through traditional Christian categories.  This book is difficult to digest.  It is made even more challenging because of the variety of topics it covers.  Despite this, it is extremely valuable for those interested in postmodern theology or the movement called Radical Orthodoxy.	2005-06-06

The authors take readers through a series of odd questions in an attempt to show the hidden connections between things.  Serious questions are asked: why do people cheat? how does manipulation of information breed fear? how much does parenting matter?  However, these questions are answered with odd data, sometimes anecdotal.  All of this makes for a very interesting read.  The book focuses more on statistics than economics (although, behind all the numbers is an interest in incentives).  In the end, the book is interesting and leads to good questions.	2005-05-18

She does so through a process of internal critique of some commonly held Christian beliefs.  She begins by affirming the transcendence of God and God as creator.  She then argues that on the grounds of these beliefs, a fixed hierarchy of people is unjustifiable.  Oppression and injustice must be opposed as all are children of God.  Therefore, all people must be given respect.  Further, differences must be respected, since the transcendence of God implies that we will never be able to judge fully.  Activism is advocated, provided that it remains humble in light of human sinfulness. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful book for those who are seeking a way to understand justice in light of Christian beliefs.  If you are interested in the practical application of theology, this book is for you.	2005-05-17

Books	4	18	24	N	N	Revolutionary Christianity	West's books is an eye-opening account of racism since modernity and a proposed response.  He begins with an account of modernity and proceeds to an insightful genealogy of racism.  Racism, he claims, comes from a combination of an emphasis on science, Cartesian philosophy, and Greek thought and aesthetics.  West then turns attention to four common African American responses to the problem, highlighting humanism as the preferable option.  Finally, West spends 2 chapters arguing for a combination of Christian and Marxist perspectives for a revolutionary Christianity. <br /> <br />There is no doubt that West is brilliant, articulate, and passionate.  His diagnosis of the problems of racism and modernity are indespensible.  The reason the book only receives 4 stars is that I am not sure Marxism is the correct choice for Christians.  Without a doubt, Marxist thought provides insights Christians need.  However, it seems to me that another political system will bring about more problems.  I suggest that the church itself is political, so Christians need not seek out another source of more effective political thought.  The church, when it functions as it ought, is all that is needed to reform society.	2005-04-21

He first discusses the difference between an idol and an icon.  An idol reflects the gaze of being back to him or herself.  Idols are inherently limited by the essence and mind of the being who sees and/or thinks of them.  Icons, on the other hand, provide the transcendent a face through which to gaze at being.  Through this gaze, being is changed.  Nietzsche and Heidegger show us that various conceptions of \\"God\\" are but idols.  The moral god is a product of human ideals.  The metaphysical god of the first cause is another reflection of human limitation.  Even the god of Being is not the true God as Heidegger contends.  Therefore, Marion understands that God loves prior to being.  Love transcends contingent categories and is purely given.  God is pure agape and is made known through revelation in the icon of Jesus Christ.  As God gazes back at being, vanity is reversed.  God is revealed through the eucharistic presence that is the source of theology. <br /> <br />This book is difficult to read.  However, the reader who struggles through will be rewarded.  When all is said and done, Marion offers a thoroughly Christian account of the divine in a philosophically rigorous way.	2005-04-19

Winner does not rehearse the stale and ineffective arguments we have heard for years (abstinence is the only 100% effective birth control, you don't want STDs, sex feels better when you're married, etc.).  Instead, she honestly and bluntly examines chastity from the standpoint of a Christian community.  Writing as one who has had premarital sex, Winner brings a sense of honesty to her writing.  She is not afraid to deal with the myths, lies, and truths about premarital sex.  In the end, she treats sex theologically, within the story of God that is embodied in the church. <br /> <br />This book is intended for single adults who are struggling with chastity.  As a youth director, I thought about sharing this book with my high school students.  Many of them are dealing with the same issues and need a book like this one.  I would not share this book with middle school students as a group.  The discussion is too mature for most 13 year-olds I know. <br /> <br />If you are a single Christian this book is for you.  If you are a married Christian in a church with single Christians, this book is for you.  If you want to understand why Christians remain chaste outside of marriage, this book is definately for you.	2005-04-13

Through the sacrament, the church embodies an alternative to nationalism, civil society, and globalization.  In the first chapter, Cavanaugh outlines the way the emergence of the nation-state created an individualized religion.  This is because the state presents a narrative of salvation.  The church, on the other hand, presents a true story of salvation as it participates in the Eucharist.  In the second chapter, Cavanaugh outlines the contention of some Christians that the church should particpate in civil society, since it is a \\"free space\\" and the means of reform.  However, the church is a free and public space, in the best senses of the terms, as it gathers around the Lord's table.  Here Christians can truly engage in acts that can transform the world.  Finally, in the third chapter Cavanaugh takes on globalization.  As he presents it, globalization is an extension of the project of the nation-state.  Globalization allows the universal to dominate the local, to a greater degree than nation-states do.  The church is a counter-politics in that the Eucharist allows for a spacial relations to be reconceived.  The universal/local dichotomy is collapsed as the universal is encapsulated in the local. <br /> <br />This is a great collection of essays.  The only problem is that the book is too short. Cavanaugh promises more to come on these topics.  I hope that he is true to his word.  This is a must read for those interested in the church and politics.	2005-04-12

He does an excellent job.  According to Fiddes, God is defined by as the movement of Trinitarian relationships.  As Christians, we are called to particpate in the Triune life of God.  We do so through such practices as prayer, worship, baptism, and Eucharist.  We come to know God as movement of relationship through particpation.  The book is divided into two sections.  The first is an articulation of the doctrine of God in the terms Fiddes sets out. The second is an expansion of that doctrine into other aspects of the Christian experience, such as prayer, forgiveness, and the sacraments. <br /> <br />This book is extremely well put together.  Though I am not sure an understanding of God as relationships would supply answers to all metaphysical questions, Fiddes does not intend to describe \\"the god of the philosophers.\\"  I would recommend this book for those who are interested in the Trinity and all pastors.	2005-04-08

This book is incredibly dense, no doubt due in part to its brevity.  The book opens with a treatment of the incarnation of the Word of God in the person of Jesus Christ.  This incarnation is one that cannot be abstracted from the thoroughly human life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.  It moves then to an articulation of God as Trinity and gift-giving.  This leads to an understanding of humans as recipients of God's gifts of life and salvation through the work of Jesus Christ.  A discussion of the shape of human life, or ethics, follows.  Those who have been received the gift of life in Christ are to participate in gift-giving towards others.  This is not a form of reciprocity but an expression of thanksgiving and participation in Christ.  Finally, eschatology is treated spacially rather than temporally.  In other words, Christians should focus not on the future but on their present life in Christ.  Eternal life is life in God.  Throughout the work, Tanner operates with two overriding principles: 1) the radical transcendence of God and 2)non-competitive relations between God and creatures. <br /> <br />This is an extremely helpful book.  Look for the sequel, where Tanner promises to flesh out more fully the concepts developed here.  This book is particularly important for theologians interested in gift-giving as a category for reflection.	2005-03-30

It could be an \\"introduction\\" to political theology, because, although it is over 500 pages, there is much more that needs to be said on the topic.  Political theology \\"reader\\" would also be an appropriate description, since it contains essays by many thinkers working in the field.  In the end, though, this book is definately a \\"companion\\" to the other writings on the topic available today. <br /> <br />As ought to be expected, this book represents many different perspectives on the task of political theology.  It does a good job sampling the numerous viewpoints currently being articulated.  One should not expect a coherent presentation.  Instead, this is a collection that draws from many conversations. <br /> <br />The book is broken into five parts.  The first discusses traditional resources in political theology.  This includes scripture, worship, and various traditions prior to the twentieth-century.  The second surveys various understandings of the task of political theology.  These essays include expositions of movements as well as thinkers.  Undoubtedly this section could be greatly expanded, but it does a fair job at surveying the field.  The third section is, in my opinion, the most beneficial.  Through various doctrines, the task of political theology is examined in a constructive manner.  Here the differences in perspective truly come out.  The fourth section, also exceptional, gives a response to various movements in the world and academia.  Here, for instance, a response to democracy is given.  This section could easily have included 2 essays on each topic to present a balanced picture.  The final section gives an Islamic and Jewish perspective on the task of political theology.  I found these two essays very helpful. <br /> <br />This is a must read for those interested in the interaction of Christian theological thought and the political (however the terms are defined).  Readers will be challenged in their beliefs and forced to examine their true convictions.  This is a good text to be used as a survey or a springboard for further discussion.	2005-02-17

They do so by stating what God is not.  The essays are at least thought provoking and at most inflammatory.  Then again, the authors never claimed to not be controversial. <br /> <br />In the book there are six essays, five of which speak to something God is not.  The first claims that God is not a passive participant in creation.  The second argues that God is not nice in the way that culture has claimed God to be.  The third reminds that God is not American and this nation is not truly \\"under God.\\"  The fourth describes God's economics in contrast to capitalism, telling us that God is not capitalist.  The fifth says that God is not religious becuase that term has come to stand for a generic faith and a generic god.  The final essay speaks about God's being one, holy, catholic, and apostolic. <br /> <br />I found these essays a quick read.  That is because I have read and heard most of the arguments before.  I found the essay on economics to be most useful. <br /> <br />This book is great for undergrads or folks interested in exmining their view of God.

For many, it is a way of thinking that is as confusing as it is insightful.  James K. A. Smith shows the promise of Radical Orthodoxy in this very accessible introduction. <br /> <br />Smith aims to summarize what the \\"theological sensibility\\" (most of the authors don't want to be considered a movement or school of thought) known as Radical Orthodoxy has been about.  He also intends to point out deficiencies in \\"RO\\" and suggest avenues for future research.  He does all of this from a Reformed point of view, one that is missing in much of RO's work.  The book is divided into two parts.  The first seeks to place RO within the greater theological and philosophical discussion.  It does so by discussing other ways of thinking, outlining RO's main contentions, and giving a brief account of the history of philosophy as RO reads it.  The second section more clearly articulates RO's contentions and points the way to future improvements.  Chapters deal with politics, epistemology, ontology, and ecclesiology.  Smith makes it clear that he finds RO's soteriology and understanding of sin particularly in need of repair. <br /> <br />If you are a student struggling with RO, this book is definately for you.  If you are theologian interested in RO, this book will help summarize RO and give a brief critique.  If you are involved in RO and want to see it move in different directions, this book is a useful part of the conversation.  I highly recommend it.	2005-02-02

Wells believes that Christians act as part of a five act play (creation-Israel-Jesus-church-eschaton) that is the drama of God's interaction with the world.  Christians act correctly when they improvise according to the nature of the story. <br /> <br />Wells brakes his arguments into three sections.  The first makes the case for improvisation as an appropriate metaphor for Christian action.  He places his understanding in stark contrast with deontological and consequentialist ethics.  The second section outlines the main components of improvisation, which he then applies to the Christian life.  The important components are forming habits, assessing status, questioning givens, overaccepting, and reincorporation.  Through this improvisation, the story always move forward in a way that is faithful.  In the final section, Wells shows how imporovisation might be applied to ethical issues.  He deals with two that seem threatening and two that seem promising.  The goal is to act in ways that bring the issues into continuity with the drama of God. <br /> <br />This is a great book.  Read it if you are interested in Christian ethics.  It also provides insights into other parts of theological study.	2005-01-13

During the modern period, culture was seen as tightly bounded and defined by consensus.  Postmodern theory has seen culture as permeable and malleable.  It is impacted by other cultures and is affected by internal argument.  From there she reasons that theology operates within a Christian culture, a culture that is loosely bordered.  Christian culture is not isolated from other cultures.  To the contrary, it is affected greatly by them.  It is defined not by tradition or continuity of belief, but by ongoing argument.  The Christian culture is in an extended argument concerning what it means to be a disciple of the Word of God.<br /><br />Tanner presents her arguments well.  The book progresses steadily from cultural theory to suggestions for theological method.  She ends with a theory of Christian culture that allows for much disagreement and creativity.  Her thoughts are well reasoned and thoroughly argued.  Buy this book if you want to understand the role of theology in the Christian culture.	2005-01-03

This book is a collection of sermons, interviews, prayers, and reflections.  Because of this, there is no theological argument to be won and no position to be defended.  Rather, a man who is attempting to be faithful can speak openly. <br /> <br />This book contains many of the themes Hauerwas has addressed over the years.  If there is an emphasis, it is on the nature of time as God's gift.  The world was changed at Passover, 33 A.D.  Because of that change, we understand that time is God's gift to the world and to us. <br /> <br />Although they are great, don't buy this book for the theological arguments.

After briefly reviewing the history of Trinitaian theology prior to 1900, Grenz discusses how Barth and Rahner initiated this renewal of Trinitarian thinking.  Then he discusses theologians that associate the Trinity with history (Moltmann, Pannenberg, Jenson) before outlining the thoughts of those who focus on relationality (Boff, Zizioulas, LaCugna).  Finally, he turns to those who desire a return to the Immanent Trinity (Johnson, Balthasar, Torrance).  Connecting these thinkers together is a general acceptance of Rahner's Rule that the Immanent Trinity is the Economic Trinity and vice versa.  Most also value the concept of relationality to unity of divine substance. <br /> <br />Grenz's methodology is to outline a thinker's proposal and then briefly discuss some of the critics of that view.  Because of this, one never hears Grenz's opinions about the topic.  No doubt this is due to the fact that his opinions are the focus of \\"The Social God and the Relational Self.\\"  While this work gives a good description of the evolution of Trinitarian thinking, it does little to sort out the various accounts.  The reason I gave it only 4 stars is that I felt I had to read \\"Social God\\" to get the rest of the story.	2004-12-08

Cavanaugh examines Chile under the Pinochet regime.  This regime used torture as a tool of the state.  In essence, torture became a \\"liturgy\\" of the state.  Unfortunately, the church was not prepared to deal with such a turn of events.  That is because the ecclesiology of the church at the time held that the state was to care for the body while the church cared for the soul.  This dualism created problems for the church resisting the torture of the state. <br /> <br />It is at this point that Eucharist is suggested as a counter liturgy.  Where torture individualizes, the Eucharist creates a social body.  Eucharist helps others while the torture only harms.  In short, Eucharist provides the means for the church to engage meaninfully the wayward state. <br /> <br />This book says wonderful things about the situation in Chile.  It could also have implications in other contexts.  What does it mean for the Eucharist to act as a counter liturgy to the litugy of capitalism?  How does the building up of a social body in Eucharist allow Christians to deal with the fragmentation of war?  There is much more that could be said based on what Cavanaugh does in this wonderful book.	2004-12-06

This is unique from contemporary spiritualities in several ways.  For one thing, it is focused on the body, rather than on the non-physical mind, soul, or heart.  Clapp wants to make it clear that Christian practices, from prayer to sex, are for the body.  For another thing, this book takes seriously the uniquely Christian aspects of spirituality.  Clapp listens to the guidance of church fathers to articulate an orthodox understanding of spiritual practices.  The first part of the book focuses on outlining what the Christian tradition has taught us about spiritual things.  The second part attempts to situate these ideas within what some have called the postmodern setting (although Clapp calls it \\"Elvis World\\").  Clapp interacts with contemporary culture to make this an enjoyable read.  This book is for any Christian who wants to understand what the body has to do with Christian practices and belief.	2004-11-27

Pinches seeks to give an account, via a reading of Thomas Aquinas, of how human actions should be named.  He is reacting against contemporary action theory, which divorces action descriptions from their human contexts.  So he begins with critiques of action theory, monism in protestant ethics, and proportionalism and physicalism in contemporary Catholic moral theology.  He then begins a constructive account of action, an account that is dependent upon Aquinas.  Pinches claims, with Aquinas, that all human acts are moral acts.  He then recommends a system of classifcation of moral acts, which develops in us a set of notions that allow us to judge acts and name them.  He also tackles the issue of non-action as sin.  In the end, there is no one overarching principle of morality.  Rather there are stories that are embodied, which make us virtuous. <br /> <br />In order to act rightly, one must first see the world rightly and then speak rightly.  In other words, how we see the world and speak about our place in the world determines how we live.  If you want to understand, from a Thomistic perspective, how to speak rightly about moral acts, this is the book for you.  Although dry in sections, it is overall a wonderful book.  As a protestant, I was thrilled with the perspective of the book.  Pinches is clearly knowledgable of both protestant ethics and Catholic moral theology.  If you are interested in ethics, especially virtue ethics, this is a must read.	2004-10-28

The book opens with a criticism of two views of forgiveness Jones' wants to counter.  The first is \\"therapeutic forgiveness\\" which is almost purely psychological, making it a version of cheap grace.  The other problematic view is the \\"eclipse of forgiveness\\" which supposes that our world is so violent that forgiveness is largely futile and meaninless.  In the second part of the book, Jones presents his own views of forgiveness.  It begins with the Triune God who reveals himself in the costly forgivenss brought about in Jesus Christ.  The Holy Spirit makes this costly gift known to humans through the church.   People can then respond to God's forgiveness. For Jones, forgiveness comes first and repentance is a response to forgiveness.  Christians are then to live in response to their own forgiven-ness.  In the final section of the book, Jones discusses where the church meets the world and forgiveness is required.  He says that Christians must respond to God's forgiveness by hoping that all will one day be forgiven.  This forgiveness requires great patience, especially when it comes to enemies.  This is a wonderful book.  It is highly recommended to Christians who want to understand what it means to live as the forgiven people of God.	2004-10-23

Paul sounds an awful lot like Barth, Hauerwas, and Yoder, or they look a lot like them.  That said, it is a wonderful treatment of Pauline themes and postliberal theology.  Each chapter alternates between the two poles.  Harink treats justification as the work of God in Christ, as opposed to human work.  The Apocalypse is a present reality in the cross and resurrection of Christ.  Politics is about making the reign of God clear by communal living.  God elects a group of people, Israel, onto which is grafted the church.  This church is then a culture, which interacts with other cultures, calling them into the reign of God.  If you are  a postliberal thinker, chances are you will like this book.  If you are not, you will have some significant reservations.  All things considered, this is an excellent example of a Postliberal reading of Pauline themes.	2004-10-17

He argues that within the history of the democratic tradition, as articulated by people like Emerson, Whitman, Dewey, and Ellison, is a set of virtues and vices that correspond to a democratic conception of character.  Among the virtues it extols are piety, hope, and charity.  He then forges a way between Rawls and Rorty on one side and MacIntyre and Hauerwas on the other.  He vigoursly attacks Hauerwas and the other \\"new traditionalists\\" whom he says isolate themselves from the broader conversation in favor of sectarian pursuits.  Finally, he articulates a way forward with ethics in a time of pluralism.  Religious voices can express contasting justifiably held beliefs in common forum.  Each should express their beliefs, support them with reasons, and then engage in immanent criticism of those in oposition.  Steeped in pragmatism, Stout argues that ethics can be truthful without defining truth.  Further, this can be done without metaphysics.  What we are left with is a system that allows for truth claims, pluralism, and public debate.<br /><br />As a longtime reader of Hauerwas it is somewhat painful to give this book 5 stars, but it is well deserved.  Although I still have reservations about the democratic project, Stout's book was insightful.  Though I found his criticism of the new traditionalists a bit strong, it definately caused me to rethink some of my positions.  In the end, if one is committed to democracy but finds ethical discourse challenging, this is the way to go.	2004-10-05

He believes that we are at a crossroads and can either choose to go the way of democratization or imperialism.  He sees imperialism taking over the political landscape in three ways: \\"free-market fundamentalism,\\" \\"aggressive militarism,\\" and \\"escalating authoritarianism.\\"  These are fueled by three types of nihilism in America which grasp at power: \\"evangelistic nihilism\\" as seen in conservative politicians, \\"paternalistic nihilism\\" as observed in liberal politicians, and \\"sentemental nihilism\\" found in the media.  These attitudes fuel the grasping of power that characterizes imperialism.  Drawing from an ecclectic pool of sources, West proposes that we engage in \\"Socratic questioning\\" of the culture, \\"prophetic witness\\" to the justice and love that are absent, and \\"tragicomic hope\\" that better times are to come. <br /> <br />At its best, this book is a scathing critique of the American political landscape.  West is not afraid to criticize either party or any faith when it fails to live up to the ideals of democracy.  It is a true eye-opener.  The reason it lost a star, in my opinion, is that the book falls short when it comes to constructive solutions.  The three practices needed could have been more fully fleshed out. <br /> <br />Food for thought: as a Christian, I feel that God, as revealed in the person of Jesus Christ and who is still active through the Holy Spirit in the church today, is the ultimate determiner of my reality.  It changes all that I do, even the way I speak.  I wonder, can one who has been profoundly changed by God speak the language of democracy, when the very definition of words like \\"justice\\" are in dispute?  While I think the goal is extrordinarily important, I wonder if mere dialogue will solve the problems in the American political landscape.  Perhaps American needs a community of people who embody an alternative account of reality.  Perhaps the church needs to exemplify what it means to live a life of \\"justice\\" so that America will see itself in a new light.	2004-09-28

God is against all forms of manipulative, power-hungry empire, especially what Taylor terms \\"lockdown America.\\"  According to the book, police brutatliy, prison life, and the death penalty are all \\"theatrics of terror\\" designed to increase America's imperial power.  We are meant to be terrorized by our own government.  Taylor proposes a way of counterterror, consisting of an adversarial politics, dramatic action, and peoples' movements.  Basically, it is civil disobedience with drama. <br />Alright, lets get to the good things.  There are three qualities that bring this book to the 3 star range.  Frist, the problem he has identified is real.  Although the language is harsh (perhaps too harsh) the reality just may be worse.  Second, Taylor's understanding of a political Jesus is right on.  Third, Christians do need to do something. <br />Now, the problem with this book is it proposes the wrong solution.  His take on civil disobedience has been done.  It is part of the democratic culture, although a part that most people wish would go away.  Second, the \\"executed God\\" ends up being the god of the lowest common denomenator of all religious people.  The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will not be reduced to lowest common denomenator.  What is needed to fight injustice is a church, which Taylor abandons.  The church must not only provide dramatic action, it must provide an alternative drama to the one that democratic capitalism assums.  Perhaps the most radical action we can do is to gather around the Lord's Table together, all being equal.  That is a radical form of justice.  When we grasp the true meaning of God's justice and live it in the church, America and the world will have no choice but to sit up and take notice.  The church needs to be a justice filled alternative culture.	2004-09-23

The first section is a series of word studies on Greek words associated with the powers.  The second section consists of expositions of troublesome passages dealing with spiritual powers.  I found these sections useful, but rather dry.  The third section was a surprise, which caused me to think more highly of the book.  Wink takes the language of power in the New Testament and casts it in contemporary language.  Now power is not seen as something that is out there in the heavens.  It is not something that is primarily refering to disembodied ghouls that ought to give Christians nightmares.  Instead, it is found in the material reality of bodies interacting in complex systems that can influence and control others.  Wink sees that the language of the New Testament is profoundly true, yet at the same time myth.  It is myth that represents an all too real situation.  The great value I have found in the book is that it gives us a way to speak about power that makes it more than simply the sum of our social systems, yet is not \\"spiritual\\" in a way that gives postmodern thinkers fits.  Wink makes it clear that evil is real and even gives some ways to confront it in our world.	2004-09-09

What I found was an odd mixture of thoughts of a man in a horrible position.  The letters, poems, notes, and short stories run the gamut of emotions.    In one letter Bonhoeffer is examining some theological principle and in another he is keeping up on family relations.  If you read this book, you will get an idea of what it must have been like to be a Nazi prisoner and depend on others for your care.  You will also learn how much Bonhoeffer cared for his fiancee and best friend.  Three words of advice: 1) know a bit about Bonhoeffer's life before you pick up this book, 2) look into the new translation of this book that will be coming out soon from Ausburg Fortress Press and 3) be prepared for an emotional and moving look behind the closed doors of a Nazi prison.	2004-09-02

This book is an exercise in finishing that sentence.  Placher sets out to understand what it means to confess that the nature of God is found in love not power.  In the first part of the book, the nature of God is explored.  Placher contends that God is vulnurable in love, eternal in a way that allows for the flow of events rather than a static state, and Triune.  The second part of the book explores some contemporary issues in theology: the use of Scripture and treatment of marginalized groups of people.  The final section of the book deals with how Christians should live, both within the church and in the academy.  This is a wonderful book.  If you truly believe God is love and want to explore the implications of that belief no matter what the consequences, this is a book for you.	2004-07-27

What did surprised me was the responsive feel that many of the essays had.  In this book, it seems like Hauerwas was very aware of the criticisms against his work and feels compelled to respond to them.  Hauerwas has always been invested in Theological disputes.  However, in most of his older work, he was the one who served as a critic of another's thought.  Lately, though, much of his work has been defending his own ideas (which he would probably claim are not his own, but a faithful expression of the Christian faith).  This book is no exception.<br />     Hauerwas has been criticized for being anti-modern, anti-liberal democracy, and sectarian.  In Performing the Faith, he seems to be saying &quot;yeah, but so what&quot; to the first two.  He is against modernity and wants to move away from foundational ways of thinking becasue he sees it as harmful to the faith.  He is against liberal democracy, particularly in its most typical recent defenses, because it replaces the Christian story with a new non-story (the story that you don't need a story).  It seems, though, that it is the sectarian charge that he takes most offense to.  In this book particularly, Hauerwas seeks to make clear that the distinction he draws between the church and the world is &quot;permeable&quot; and for the good of the world.  You find a desire for the church's witness to the world to be such that the world knows it is the world and desires to be the church.  His emphasis on Bonhoeffer is important because Bonhoeffer experienced the tension between the church and the world in unique and compelling ways.<br />     Buyer beware: this is a book of Hauerwas essays not a book on Bonhoeffer.  Only the first section deals with Bonhoeffer.  Not surprisingly, Hauerwas's read of Bonhoeffer makes Bonhoeffer sound a lot like Hauerwas (and Yoder).  That does not necessarily make it wrong, but it is worth noting.<br />     I believe this is a wonderful defense of the ideas Hauerwas has fought so long for.	2004-07-06

The problem he deals with is one from phenomenology.  If something is transcendent (as is God), then it cannot be conceptualized or spoken of without doing violence to its transcendence.  Essentially, we cannot speak of something that is wholly other without making it immanent, even if only in our speech.  Yet this speech does not do justice to God.  The other option is not to speak, but this does not seem like such a good option either.  Following the young Heidigger and Augustine, Smith develops an incarnational model of speech.  Such speech does not violate transcendence, but points beyond itself to the greater reality (God).  Further, it does not do violence because the transcendent One (God) initiated the speech.  This is a difficult read if you are not familiar with French Deconstructionist philosophers like Derrida, Marion, and Levinas, but it is well worth the effort.	2004-05-30

Just as Barth described the threat of Hitler to Christianity in \\"Theological Existence Today,\\" Hauerwas here outlines the threats he sees presenting themselves to the church and the appropriate response. Hence he presents a critique of Liberal Democracy in general and America in particular.  In response, he sets forth an account of the virtues and character to be found in the church.  He also emphasizes the embodied nature of the church's narrative and, of course, peace.  Some of the essays are very direct while others are more obscure in their presentation.  Since some of the pieces are Hauerwas at his best, they have been reprinted in other books.  Also, the themes are repeated in some his later works.  Other than the repetition, this is a great collection of essays.	2004-05-21

According to Weaver, Jesus saves by living under the evil systems and structures of power, exposing their true nature in his death, and overcoming them in resurrection.  In this way, God is not demanding or perpetrating violence and is on the side of the oppressed.  This atonement theory stands in distinction from Anselm's articulation of the atonement in which Jesus dies as a punishment for all sin or a payment to God.  It is also in opposition to Abelard's understanding that Jesus shows us God's love and the best way to live.  To make his case, Weaver relies heavily on theology from groups who speak from the margins of society.  It is clear that the goal is to articulate an understanding of God's action in the life of Christ that stands opposed to violence.  Read this book if you have ever had the feeling that in Christ God did more than give you an example of how to live or if you have suspected that God didn't have to see blood to feel better about you.	2004-05-14

McClendon's basic idea is that when we explore the lived lives of people, we will find certain images to be central.  When these are people of faith, these images are formed by and therefore display their convictions.  These images can then serve as a guide to correct past theological thinking or spur new thought.  When used in community, biography becomes a means of self-correction for theology.  To illustrate his point, McClendon gives biographical sketches of four men of faith and then explores the images that are central to these lives.  The work is not complete, but it was not intended to be, as the process of theology is a continual one.  This book should be read by those intrested in narrative approaches to theology.  It should also be read by people who want to explore how the lived experiences of one person can be used to change a community of faith.	2003-12-30

Those not well read in theology and philosophy should begin elsewhere.  It seems that Milbank writes so that readers will have to struggle with the book nearly as much as he has obviously struggled with the issues it presents.  That said, this is a very profound work that opens many avenues of research.  Milbank is committed to recasting the orthodox conception of God into our \\"postmodern\\" context.  Thus he works from the assumption that the classical attributes of God (omniscience, omnipotence, immutibility, etc.) are true.  In this work, Milbank explores the category of \\"gift\\" as a way of understanding God's interaction in the world, specifically in terms of forgiveness.  The book moves from an understanding of evil as privation, to the life, death, and resurrection of Christ, and finally to the church and interaction with contemporary culture.  Along the way, Milbank draws heavily on the work of many theologians and philosophers.  I do not agree with all that is presented in this book, but it most definately caused me to think more critically about the positions I hold.	2003-12-17

Johnson believes that historical criticism in general holds very limited possibilities and that the Jesus Seminar is particularly bad.  He attacks the Seminar for their attempts to gain the attention of the media.  He also criticizes the tequniques of the Seminar.  After he finishes his polemic against the historical critical method, which is over half of the book, Johnson presents a constructive model.  He holds that the real Jesus is the Jesus who is living and experienced by the church.  The resurrection, he claims, is not historical (a human event in time and space) but is very real.  The real Jesus is the one who suffered and died for others and teaches his disciples to follow him.  Johnson's later book, Living Jesus, is a more complete explanation of this proposal.	2003-11-12

He focuses primarily on the Catholic church.  From Dulles' analysis, there are five basic ways to understand the church.  He explores how these models have been used over time, as well as their particular strengths and weaknesses.  In the rest of the book, Dulles explores some of the issues surrounding ecclesiology.  He has also added a new model which is a synthesis of the other five.  My only complaint about the book is that it makes divisions too simple and straightforward.  Rarely is there a church that fits all of the descriptions of one model or does not somehow combine several models.  The book is helpful, however, to pastors who seek to understand the thought patterns of the members of their church.  It is also helpful to congregants who desire to understand more fully what it means to be the church.  All things considered, this book is an asset to pastors, students, and anyone involved in ministry.	2003-05-17

In the last two chapters, Hauerwas explores some concrete practices that should accompany such an understanding of the church.
