US	27458009	R19O7AJFUG60J6	0385291345	219860438	Warlock	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Funny, but with Flaws	\\"Warlock\\" by Jim Harrison follows Johnny Lundgren, a.k.a Warlock, an unemployed man who lives rather aimlessly with his wife Diana after losing his job.  Warlock and Diana have an interesting marriage, not exactly bad, not exactly good.  Warlock cheats on Diana, and Diana cheats on Warlock.  Despite this, Warlock and Diana have the potential to be a really good couple. <br /> <br />Warlock lives in a fantasy world, he sees the world through rose-colored glasses and it's very entertaining to see his constant sexual experiences written in such interesting terms, from Patty, a unemployment agent who smells like pee, to Aurora a definite player, and who plays Warlock like a ukelele. <br /> <br />Diana suggests that Warlock get a job when she's worried that he's become depressed.  She gets him an interview with the eccentric Dr. Rabun, and ends up looking at trees in the Upper Peninsula. <br /> <br />This story is an interesting one, it's very funny, just with Warlock's fantasies, but there seems to be a weakness in character with this book.  I would suggest you read it, if you aren't faint of heart.	2005-10-06

Rowling: New and Revised: The Wizard Behind Harry Potter	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Could've been better	I checked this book out from the library hoping to learn more about JK Rowling, but I was disappointed.  It provided very little about her, more about Harry Potter than anything else.  Most of what's in here you can find in interviews she has done in the past. <br /> <br />Something that really irritated me was the constant jumping around this book did.  It would be describing something at a specific period in JK's life, then jump ahead 5 years and describe something else, then jump back 8 years, and so on.  That was really confusing at first and really irritating.  There are probably much better books, don't bother reading this, you won't learn anything new.	2005-10-02

It was an interesting read due to the perspective that it took.  The story follows Okonkwo, a man known for his fierceness, and tells what happens when \\"things fall apart\\" in their culture.  The Europeans arrive, and they are a bit pesky at first, but then they turn into a larger problem than anyone could've ever thought possible.  This was a good story, but the ending was a bit of a disapointment.	2005-09-25

Granted, there are some unanswered questions in the story, still this is a good book.  The writing is much more clear and easy to read, and the main character, Kathy is so much more likeable and not so wishy washy like the Kathy in Search for Joyful. <br /> <br />In this book, Kathy is the daughter of Kathy Forquet and Erich Von Kerll, she has never met her father, and wonders about him constantly during her difficulties with her stepfather.  She has a talent for singing, and finds that lots of people like her singing.  She eventually marries a con-artist, which is one of the mistakes that she makes. <br /> <br />This book is much easier to read and much more enjoyable.  However, there is nothing explained about Mrs. Mike, she is only mentioned in several sentences, not to mention other characters in Search for Joyful.  Also, a little unclear is the time between Search for Joyful and Kathy Little Bird.  Things which aren't that well explained take place during this story. <br /> <br />Despite the unclear history, this is still a really good story, not like Mrs. Mike, but so much better than Search for Joyful it's almost unbelievable.	2005-05-09
US	27458009	R8ECZRV6UJVXR	0060520833	156062207	The Hidden Life of Otto Frank	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Very eye-opening	While there are many things that are explained about the characters in Anne Frank already, this book goes into very deep detail about them, even more than what one would've thought possible.  I will reinforce what has been said by saying that the text was a little dry at times, but still a good read. <br /> <br />Some of the complaints I have with this book are, the author tries way too hard to make Otto be the good guy.  She contradicts herself when she does this.  For example, she claims that Otto married Edith, Anne's mother because he was in need of money.  She then goes into great detail about how he needed this for his business and his family, but leaves out that he married her for her money.  There are several other little things like that in there, also. <br /> <br />Another thing is with Tonny Alhers.  The entire book basically makes the case that Tonny Alhers turned the people living in the secret annex, but in the epilogue, she contradicts herself by suggesting that Tonny's wife did it. <br /> <br />Still, this is a very good and eye-opening book.  It shows that there was a lot more issues that went on than is mentioned in the Diary.	2005-04-23

When I finally got around to checking it out from the library and read it, I was surprised.  This is an excellent story, perhaps one of the best Dear America stories that I've read. <br /> <br />The story begins with Caty, a Quaker girl fearing the Indians, and seeing them only as the \\"bad guys.\\"  She and her brother are kidnapped on the way home from school, and she fears for her life at first when she is placed with two Indian women.  She eventually lightens up to them, enjoys their company, and falls in love with a young man who was also kidnapped many years past. <br /> <br />She is eventually rescued, and is forced to return against her will to her old life.  She goes back to her old life finding everything has changed.  People look at her differently, her mother barely ever says a word to her, and her younger siblings are terrified of her.  A very good book, and an excellent read.	2005-04-09

There are however, many dull ones, and many pointless ones, such as Stannard Rock.  This is an enjoyable read, but not as enjoyable as its predecessor.  Still, a good book, and I would recommend anyone who likes ghosts and hauntings stories to read this.	2005-04-08

I enjoyed it to an extent.  I particularly enjoyed the odd things that Lake Superior did in the past that are mentioned in this book, such as the lakeshore receding about 15 feet without cause or reason, or the phenomenon called \\"the Three Sisters,\\" which I have heard of, but never seen in print. <br /> <br />Besides that, there are some things in this book which I thought to be pointless, stupid, and just plain shouldn't have been placed in the book.  Overall, a good book, but there were little things I would've left out.  I still would recommend this book, and anyone who enjoyed Fred Stonehouse's \\"Haunted Lakes\\" books, or Gerald Hunter's \\"Haunted Michigan\\" would probably enjoy this also.	2005-04-08

I really enjoyed it.  This book isn't just about ghosts and hauntings, but all sorts of mysterious happenings that have occured across Michigan.  I love ghost stories, but it was cool to read the other stories in this, such as the one that may or may not have been spontaneous human combustion.  Excellent book, and I recommend anyone who enjoys these stories that lives in the state of Michigan read this book.	2005-04-08

I do like the way that the authors introduce the topic.  The only thing I would say that could be considered wrong is their instant presumption that the ruins are Celtic.  I do think, however, that there is very solid evidence to prove that the ruins mentioned in the book are indeed Celtic in origin, and that the matter deserves to be further investigated.	2005-04-06

This book is one of the best in the entire series in my opinion.  The story takes place just after the Civil War on a plantation, and though the negros on the place expected life to change, it hasn't changed at all. <br /> <br />One of the things that make this story one of the best is Patsy herself.  Instead of giving her a perfect life, the author gave her anything but that.  Patsy hobbles, one of her legs is shorter than the other, she stutters and stammers, and because of this, everyone presumes that she is stupid.  She is anything but.  She also longs for a family, but doesn't even know who her parents were. <br /> <br />This is an outstanding story, one of the things that make this story good, once again is the heroine.  Patsy is perhaps one of the best characters written.  This is one of the best of the \\"Dear America\\" series.	2005-03-26

I will say this, however.  Due to the \\"Secret Language of Birthdays,\\" this book will be always compared to it, and therefore seen as a let-down.  If you think in those terms, then yes it is, if you don't however, and read it and see the information it contains, it's good.  It has some information that is lacking from the Birthday book.  At the risk of contradicting myself, I have to say it's less specific, it's more general, and lacks the \\"shock\\" that it's predecessor has.  It's a good book, but not good enough to get five stars.	2005-03-25

The story is well-written, easy to get into, and you connect easily with the characters.  The only complaint about this book that I have is the fifth part.  That didn't go well with the rest of the story at all, and the characters seemed to have changed. <br /> <br />The story follows Rama, a very important person with a very important destiny.  Sita, Rama's loving wife, and Lakshmana, Rama's brother.  Rama is forced to leave his kingdom, and Lakshmana and Sita go with him.  Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana have a fairly comfortable life considering the situation they're in.  All that changes when Sita is kidnapped.  I will not reveal anymore, but it introduces more good characters, and a wonderful good vs. evil story. <br /> <br />Wonderful story, I would recommend that anyone interested in mythology or anyone in general should read this book.	2005-03-19

If you like reading mythological stories, I would recommend this, if you want a book that simply lists off the characteristics of each of the signs, I don't recommend it.  I found it to be a very enjoyable read, and would recommend it to those interested in stories that show off characteristics of the signs.	2005-03-13

I know it is representative of Russian literature, but it's very bleak and depressing.  None of the plays have a really happy ending, but they do have good endings.  My least favorite of the plays was Three Sisters, and my favorite was Cherry Orchard.  Three Sisters, in my opinion is about the most bleak, unsatisfying, and depressing play about life and love I have ever read.  Cherry Orchard is, in my opinion well thought out, bad things happen in this play, but there are reasons for these occurances, and it also has the most satisfying ending of all the plays in this book.  Seagull, Uncle Vanya, and Ivanov aren't really bad, but aren't spectacular.  If you want to read a light-hearted and easy going play, don't read this.  They were interesting enough for me to give this four stars, they aren't bad for the most part, but aren't spectacular either.	2005-03-04

It's a very hard book to define, as due to it being a graphic novel.  The story is a very realistic and sad one, despite the story in comic book form.  It tells the story of Vladek Spiegelman, and his wife Anja, and their struggles to stay alive in Poland during the times of World War II.  Vladek tells his son, Art about the difficult times the Jews had at this time.  It also takes place in modern times, Anja is dead, and Vladek has a second wife, with whom he has a difficult time getting along with.

Marie Antoinette, or Maria Antonia, as she is called in the beginning, is molded into someone she doesn't want to be so she can marry the Dauphin, or Crown Prince of France.  She is very unhappy about her forced marriage to someone she doesn't know, and is very tired of all the ridiculous French customs she must learn.  She arrives in France, in a state of shock, finds that she doesn't connect with her husband at all, and makes an enemy within the court, the King's mistress.  In time, she becomes friends with her husband, and begins to get used to French customs.  A very good book, I would call this the best of all the series.  I would recommend anyone who reads these books to definitely read this one.	2005-02-25

Isabel is forced to live in Segovia, a place that she finds tedious and dull.  She is constantly being offered to various princes she should and shouldn't marry, she has a general dislike for her brother, the King, and her sister-in-law, whom on several occasions Isabel herself witnessed being unfaithful.  Good as far as her thoughts go, such as being trapped in at Segovia, and not a bad read, despite the story lacking any serious plot.	2005-02-24

This book was terrible compared to Mrs. Mike.  The characters are 2-dimensional, you lack any emotion for them, nor do you even care what happens to them.  You could take this story, stick in a soap opera and not know the difference, as that is what this story basically is, a soap opera.  Not at all worthy of being \\"the long-awaited sequel to Mrs. Mike.\\"  This book, was simply terrible, as a sequal and as a book in general.  The plot is way too divided, you do not care what happens to these people at all, and the ending is what makes it especially like a soap opera.  If you are a fan of Mrs. Mike and see this in the library, check it out and read it, but otherwise don't waste your money on this piece of crap book.	2005-02-24

I would like to see what Mrs. Feeny actually looks like, however. <br /> <br />Still funny, still entertaining, and cat's do not live to their 20's but it is a COMIC STRIP.

I did not care for Julie at all, she was a complete and total spoiled brat.
