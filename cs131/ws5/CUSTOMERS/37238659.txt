This book is 702 pages, so when you read it, be prepared.<br /><br />The first half of the book is really more about their mother and father's struggle for Christ. The father is dead before the book hits 200 pages, so that's not too big a spoiler. His death seemed rather abrupt, and i've experienced the sudden lose of a parent. I just feel Paul and Marrell should have had their own book, about their early courtship, or at the very least, the early part of their marriage.  They are such great characters, they deserved it. Ahh well.<br /><br />Marrell's forced into getting a job for the sake of her children, but finds love again. It's obvious to me who, but i won't say.<br /><br />The girls really don't take center stage until the middle of the book or later. You get to seem them grow from children, to grown women with minds of their own, and an unwillingness to have anytthing to do with God. Thats different then any other Lori Wick book i've read, and why i give this book 4 stars. It does lag a bit at tmes, but it's worth the read. It's a nice escape.	2005-09-12

However, they are called back to court!<br /><br />This is a wonderful book. Detailed, like all of Ms. Smalls works. Just a great read. I wish there had been more books in the Wyndham family.	2005-09-09

Her friends, to help her, introduce her to the Channel, an \\"interactive\\" cable channel that allows her to live out her fantasies. A quick, but good read.	2005-08-08

That blood managed to get her betrothed to a man of Charlamagne's choice.  But Regeane's blood also gives her another problem. By night,thanks to her father's blood, she's wolf, and if anyone finds out, she's dead.<br /><br />With her mother's death, young Regeane is left in the care of her cruel uncle Gunabald and her witless(or just plain terrified)cousin Hugo. Gunabald is a very cruel, greedy man, who sees Regeane's betrothal as a path to the life they think they deserve. However, Regeane, as well as several friends she makes in the course of the book, have different ideas. With their help, Regeane hopes to survive, and at least, if she can't escape her marriage, at least to escape Gunabald and the plans he has for her. See, he wants her to kill her new husband, or help them do it. What Gunabald doesn't realize are the political ramifactions involved in that. But, going on.<br /><br />This is the story of a girl fighting to be what and who she is, in a world that would declare her a witch. The friends who help her are very intriguing people, and i wish there were whole books about some of them.<br /><br />It's definetly a great story.	2005-07-10

With one call, from a relative she didn't know she hads, she discovers her real mother has been alive all this time, but has just died. She makes plans to return to New Orleans, the place she was born and then swiftly taken away from at her birth.<br /><br />Michael Curry is a native of New Orleans. He moved to California with his mother after the death of his firefighter father. Educated, but still having that Irish Charm so to speak, he's had  his own share of troubles. One day, while walking on the beach, he's knocked into the water and nearly drowned. While unconcious, he has a vision, but when he wakes up after being rescused, he can't remember the vision. Also, he discovers a curios power in his hands. Then, he finds out that the person who rescuses him was none other then Rowan Mayfair.<br /><br />Their lives are almost immediatly intertwined after that. But that story is also built around a history of the Mayfair Witches. Very detailed, it's hefty read at times, but i enjoyed it everytime. If i had all day, i couldn't tell you everything about this book! The history can get a little slow, that's why it get's 4 stars. A over all good read, if you've got time for the 900+ pages!

Granted, it's a bit of a different twist on how the girl is hidden as a boy. It's done in such a way the girl doesn't even know she's a girl. Definetly kept me reading, but for some reason, i just couldnt get into it very much. A bit slow, and Tobin wasn't very likable, which is understandable considering. I really wish ther was more about some of the minor charcters. I did like Tobin's relatiinship with Ki, his squire. It's dark and moody, so if yopu like the darker side of fantasy, this is for you.	2005-07-05

Granted, not in those words..It discusses irritation around the clitoris and puts forth female circumccion as a viable remedy! what was the good \\"Dr.\\" smoking when he wrote that little gem?<br /><br />We've come a long way since books like this were considered valuble reading matriel.

Please Ms.Hamilton, get the storyline back i'm begging you!<br /><br />Ok, first off, there was an intriguing plotline at first, the murder of a demi fey and a human reporter. But that quickly got put on the back burner so Merry could have sex with..4 guards? 5? i stopped counting. i skimmed through alot of this book, the sex scenes just got a bit over the top for me.<br /><br />Merry does bring a guard into into powers they didn't have, and that was worth reading, even though she does it through sex. This is sort of like Seduced by Moonlight, almost a transition book. It takes place in one night, at the Unseelie Court. There is a few mentions of Prince Cel, Merry's cousin, but other then that, it seems her quest for a baby isn't the purpose of the series anymore. There's no danger really, even though there are an attack or two. I just got a bit frustrated at the end, when they still hadn't officially solved the murders.<br /><br />I'm hoping the next book is better then this one. I don't consider myself a prude by any standerds, but a complete plotline would be nice. It got three stars simply because of the few interesting parts in the book. Like the threesome that causes her and the two guards to suddenly appear in Quen Andais' chamber.	2005-04-20

But, i did like this book and recommend it if you liked Daughter Of The Forest. Although a bit slow, and some things seem rather rushed, it's a good book. Very nice writing. I didn't like Liadan's story as much as Sorcha's or the final story, but you can't skip around in a series like this, or you'll just get confused.<br /><br />Liadan is basically kidnapped by a band of men, and held as a hostage. She's finally returned to her family, but by then, she's fallen in love with the leader, and he with her. Also, complications in her family keep her from returning to him.  Like helping her sister escape an unwanted brutal marriage. I'd say more but i'd give up the plot. A worthy sequel.	2005-04-13

We finally get to see Marian and Lucivar's courtship, as well as the events occuring after Queen of the Darkness. I found the first story, Weaver of Dreams, to be a good way to start the book off. Then, The3 Prince Of Ebon Rih gets things moving and keeps them that way. The third story, Zuulamaan was a sad story in my opinion, and only made me hate Hekatah even more then i already did. Then there is Kaeleer's Heart. I loved how it ended i truly did.<br /><br />Anyone who loves the BJT will love these stories.	2005-01-03

Boy/Girl twins are never identical. they are always fraternal. They can look so much alike as to appear identical, but as they grow older, they won't. Anyway, enough about that.<br /><br />Celeste was a welcome change. Rather then then the usual poor to rich girl, we get a girl growing up on a farm. You can only assume they are well off, from the mentions of the mother's inheritance from a gtrandparent.  The children are home schooled by their mother, a former school teacher. Their father runs a buisness(i'm not quite sure, but i think a construction sort of thing).Other then the mother's rather odd beliefs, they have a happy,if rather isolated laugh.Things good rather well, until a tragic accident takes first the father, then later, the brother Noble dies.<br /><br />Noble was the favorite, and his death appears to send Celestes mother over the edge. And thats all i'll say. Definetly worth a read or two.	2004-11-11

This last one involves three cousins, each descended from Skye O Malley and bearing a striking resemblence to her.<br /><br />First, there is Fancy,who is Fortune's  daughter and a grand daughter of Jasmine.Fancy is a colonial who's husband has recently died under mysterious circumstances.The family has sent Fancy to her grandmother. Did Fancy have a hand in his death? Read and find out.<br /><br />Next, there is Diana. She is a descendant of Skye through the Scottish part of the family, namely Jasmine's son Patrick and his wife(whose story is told in Just Beyond Tomorrow). Diana is the good cousin, a sweet girl, who sends her suitors away, with little damage done. She can not seem to pick which man she wants to marry, and pressure from her family(her father in particular) doesn't help matters much. It's a fun story.<br /><br />Finally, there is Cynara, or Cyn. her father, Charles Stuart, jasmine's son by Prince Henry, wants her married, and soon, before she gets herself in trouble. Cyn already has her husband picked out, but he is reluntant to marry, so, she attempts to convince him that they are a perfect match for each other. Which could lead to diffculties if her family finds out.<br /><br />All in all, a good book. not as detailed as Ms.Small's previous work, but then, that doesn't matter.

At times, it was a bit hard to keep track of who's who, and who was a friend or not. But overall, a good book. Definetly worth the time.<br /><br />Edited to add: I figured i'd add more detail.<br />Phedre is a child of the Night Court, born to courtasan mother and trader father. Sadly(or not?) she's born with a scarlet mote in one of her eyes. Flawed, she cannot be a part of the world her mother was trained to, and had hoped to train her too.She's left by her mother and her life is uncertain. Until the day she discoovers for herself the full force and meaning of her flaw. Or is she flawed? Turns out, the fleck in her eye means Phedre is a rarity, something not seen for years.She has been struck by Kushiel's dart. She is an anguissette,someone who is doomed to find pleasure in pain. The only one to really see what she is, is a man named Anafil Delauney. He takes her in at age 10, and trains her alongside his other pupil, Alcuin.<br /><br />This is a novel of power, pain,misery and self discovery for Phedre. She goes from a pampered Servant of Naamah, to the bed slave of a Skaldi warrior, and everything in between. She is betrayed, and loses some dear to her.<br /><br />A great start to a series.	2004-09-16

Who knew that a few bad reviews would throw the author into such a tissy? granted, she wrote it, and i'm sure to her, it was her best ever. But, we, as people, are entitled to our opinions. My opinion of this book has not changed, i still think it's not her best. When held up to her previous novels, it falls short.

All goes well for a time, and then, like in all Bertrice Small's novels, adventure ensues! it's quite a read, very enjoyable. Taking you from Early 1800s England to Russia, and back again.	2002-11-14
