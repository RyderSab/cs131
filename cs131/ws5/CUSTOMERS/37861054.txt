Stress in primary health care professionals is so common that almost every general practice will have had some experience o it first hand.  The book is reasonably easy to read and contain extensive analysis and references.  It will therefore be particularly useful to readers who have an academic interest in stress related problems... This book will provide a useful...addition to a general practice library.\\"- L. Tapper-Jones, Roath House Surgery	2003-02-07

No one of these sections in necessarily better than the other, as they are all provide excellent summaries of the available literature.  The text is written in a style appropriate for advanced undergraduates and graduate students.  One of the things I found particularly appealing about the book is that the editors clearly emphasized to each of the contributing authors that they should include some of the cutting edge questions, where future research needs to be directed to move the various fields forward.  Therefore, the text is replete with ideas and suggestions for Masters and Ph.D. level research.  In addition, I think the editors, who obviously worked closely with the authors of each chapter, found the right balance between emphasizing the underlying discipline...and the wonderment of knowledge about marine mammals... this is a textbook that belongs in the bookshelves of practicing marine mammal biologists and academics interested in vertebrate biology.  In addition, I highly recommend this book to graduate students interested in applying the tools of a particular discipline to a specific hypothesis that can be tested using marine mammal data.  As far as textbooks go, this text has &quot;legs&quot; and I would venture to guess that its useful shelf-life will exceed 10 years in most disciplines covered.&quot; - Douglas P.

Especially useful is the coverage of results of the use of molecular biological methods that have substantially increased knowledge about these parasites during recent years.  Thirty-nine scientists, most of them recognized as experts on their topics, wrote 12 chapters of this book.  The authors not only present excellent reviews of this present knowledge, but also outline open questions and controversial discussions... this book is not just attractive for researchers working on African Trypanosomiasis, it will also be a very useful addition to the protozoological section of a library for other researchers and students.&quot; - by G.A.
