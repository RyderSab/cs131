However, this novel was far more thoughtful than I expected, and it genuinely surprised me at least two or three different times. <br />  <br /> Alice is something of an intellectual dreamer, who sees the beauty and order in science. She abandons her dreams, however, to take a job in an auction house so she can support her bitter mother. Andrew, Alice's co-worker, is immediately drawn to her, but must witness her emotional involvement with first a &quot;Dead Boy&quot; (I'll leave you to find out what that means) and then a rich aristocrat looking to auction off his very valuable Audobon folio. <br />  <br /> The characters in this book are sometimes overly dramatic, but several of them learn to laugh at, or at least recognize, their own melodramatic tendencies. The writing is wonderful, and there are two consecutive chapters in the book (about the Dead Boy) that by themselves would make a brilliant standalone short story. The details of the world of rare book auctions are also very interesting. <br />  <br /> My only reservation is that some of the minor office characters are difficult to keep straight, and some of the office politics too subtle for me to understand their significance. However, I will gladly seek out this author's other work. Overall, this novel achieves an unusual combination of light entertainment and thoughtful fiction.	2004-07-21

First, I read a lot of science fiction, including \\"social\\" science fiction that speculates about the future of society rather than focusing on techology.  This book makes a classic mistake: it changes one major thing in society yet \\"freezes\\" everything else where it is now, which is entirely unbelievable.<br />In this book, we are told that the main character was born a few years AFTER the population laws in the U.S. went into effect.  The character is in his early teens.  That means that assuming the laws got passed tomorrow, this book takes place some 15-20 years in the future.  Yet the characters are still using Internet chat rooms in which they painstakingly type their messages to each other.  Does anyone really believe we'll still be using this clumsy method, as opposed to virtual reality or a voice interface, 20 years from now?  The book also has the same suburban shopping malls we have today, and the same housing developments of McMansions.  Science fiction editors would have laughed this story right back to the author.  I think she only got away with it because she's dealing with a publisher/editor who knows nothing about science fiction and the fact that it needs to be believeable to be effective.  Just because it's written for young adults or children doesn't mean the author can get away with being lazy.<br />Secondly, and worse, the book implies that ANY type of population control can ONLY be an evil plot by a corrupt government.  We find out that the government faked reports of impending starvation in order to impose the overpopulation laws.  Therefore, the government is wrong and the \\"third\\" children are unfairly oppressed.  I agree with the author that unauthorized children should not be punished under population laws (rather the parents who break the laws should be punished), but this book gives the impression that anyone expressing concerns about overpopulation, and suggesting that SOME kind of control will eventually be necessary, is an alarmist or corrupt or both.  Most Americans simply will not acknowledge that the world is overpopulated, or will acknowledge it but say \\"it's not a problem here.\\"  Meanwhile, many of them continue to have more than two children, all the while complaining about how traffic has increased and areas have been overdeveloped.  Therefore, the book gives the impression that overpopulation is not really occuring in this country or in the world, which in my opinion is exactly the wrong message to give.ressing concerns about overpopulation, and suggesting that SOME kind of control will eventually be necessary, is an alarmist or corrupt or both.

While there are still many areas that could have been improved upon, I am impressed that Pocket gave the author permission to have important things happen to a few of the characters, particularly B'Elanna.  In addition, the Borg situation turned out to be much more clever and interesting than I expected.<br />The hologram rights' storyline was still kind of silly, and implies that every holographic waiter and every holographic Orion slave girl can and will develop self-awareness and sentience.  Previously, we've been led to believe that the Doctor's unique situation in developing self-awareness was due to his being left &quot;on&quot; all the time and having to exceed his original program by being the Chief Medical Officer when he was was meant to be a supplement.  I don't buy the holographic rights advocates' view that if you coalesce a bunch of photons into a projected 3-D image carrying a tray of food, the hologram is instantly going to feel unsatisified with its menial job.  The Doctor is special.  Minuet from Next Gen was also special, with a particular reason.  Moriarty was special, with a particular reason.  That Irish village on Voyager sort of became special, although I never bought that and thought it was silly.<br />Anyhow, this book was better than expected and definitely better than Part I.  Also, the very last page (don't want to give it away) sets things up nicely for further adventures.	2003-07-07

What I enjoyed most was Janeway's interactions with her former fiance Mark, his current wife, and their son.  B'Elanna's situation may also prove to be interesting.<br />However, the holographic \\"uprising\\" is contrived and silly, and the Borg threat serves mainly to get the Voyager crew (even though they're not a crew anymore) in trouble, yet put them in a position where they will be able to get together, defy Starfleet, and presumably save the Earth.  This having to defy Starfleet was overdone in both Classic Trek (especially the movies) and Next Gen.  If Starfleet handles things so badly that ship crews must constantly defy regulations to do the right thing, Starfleet never would have survived this long.<br />I'll read the second book and hope for the best, but I think Star Trek is losing its punch.  While I like many \\"Enterprise\\" characters, for instance, the episode plots in Season 2 were tired retreads of old Trek plots (transporter malfunctions, stranded on a \\"desert\\" planet with a space babe, etc.) and even an episode that was a remake of the movie \\"Enemy Mine\\"!  It's time for some fresh blood among the writers -- and to be fair, they must be given a little more freedom to do interesting things with the characters.	2003-06-11

Falconer conveys emotions with very few lines.  I love the 2-page spread that features Olivia trying on all her clothes.  In the lower-left corner, Olivia is trying on pantyhose -- and her entire body is crammed into one leg.  I didn't even notice that little detail until my second or third time through the book.

While this one has a lot to say, there are some problems in the telling that take away a lot of the story's value.<br />Anthony has taken a job at fast-food restaurant O'Dermott's (a thinly-disguised McDonald's) because he wants revenge on Turner, who \\"stole\\" Anthony's girlfriend.  Turner turns out to be even more of a jerk than Anthony realized, and so Anthony comes up with a master plan of revenge in conjucntion with co-worker Shunt, who is on a one-man anti-fast-food crusade.  The plan involves angering their long-time rivals, Burger Queen.<br />While Anthony's \\"voice\\" is distinctive, much of the book is not believable and there are few characters to admire, with perhaps Shunt being the main exception.  Anthony's former girlfriend correctly tells Anthony she wasn't anyone's to \\"steal\\", but aside from this she behaves in typical teenage sheep-follows-the-crowd fashion.  Stacey, Turner's girlfriend, openly admits that Turner is a jerk but doesn't seem to want to do much about it.  Rick and Jenn, a cooing-lovey-dovey couple, turns out to be idiots as well:  Rick admits the secret to getting girls is getting them drunk, and essentially tells Anthony that his lack of pawing girls is what lost him his girlfriend.  In other words, treat girls with respect and they'll think you're a wuss.  I don't think the author is espousing this view, but neither is Anthony proven right in his view that respect is the way to go.<br />All in all, a good effort but unsatisfying and disappointing in several regards.	2002-10-18

This miniature book makes the PERFECT stocking stuffer or small gift for any Nancy Drew fan, or anybody who read Nancy Drew growing up, even if they haven't kept that interest in later life. It gets 5 stars just for the nostalgia value, and I love the way it makes gentle, affectionate fun of the girl genius who could do everything (paint like Picasso, ski like a pro, sing, dance, act, ride horses like a champion.....oh, and I guess she was a detective, too!). <br />The book, complete with a hanging magnifying glass bookmark on an attached ribbon, is divided into sections: Survival Strategies, Dating: A Primer, Sleuthing 101, The Delicate Art of Etiquette, Wilderness Tips, On Being a Lady, Powers of Observation, and Accoutrements. Many of the book covers and interior illustrations we remember are reproduced throughout, and the text consists of tips and the titles of the book the tip comes from. <br />As a single example, here's my personal favorite: &quot;If you see something resembling a shark in a river, don't fret. It's more likely to be a small submarine operated by thieves.&quot; -- The Mystery of Lilac Inn. I never in a million years would have remembered that on my own, but it all comes back when you read this little gem! What fun!	2001-12-15

She is infuriated by any man who doesn't pay her the level of attention she believes she is owed.<br />The main reason for giving this book such a low rating (I would probably rate it 2 1/2 if halves were allowed) is that Anne just doesn't seem to learn or grow. She's impossible to like, unlike Scarlett O'Hara who at least had real situations to overcome that required some pluck.<br />Most of Anne Emery's other books are delightful (the Burnaby family, Dinny Gordon, etc.). Anne Archer is unfortunately not one of her endearing heroines.	2001-12-10

There were far too many convenient coincidences, and the short length of time during which Chris goes from &quot;innocent&quot; to quick-to-suspect-the-worst-of-everyone is simply not believable.<br />There was only one point that had a trace of Pullman as I know  him from the brilliant &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; trilogy:  when the book discusses how the loss of innocence (in the metaphorical, Garden of Eden sense) is not just bad, but also good in that people who lose their innocence then have the knowledge they need to consciously do good in the world.<br />The book is also manipulative in that it opens with the sentence:  Chris met the girl he was going to kill.....  and then does not follow through with a conclusion that supports that statement.	2001-11-10

Hannah (aka PKP, for Princess Killer Pinknose) and Sarah (aka Pudge, though she hates being called that; also aka Fluffy) are two felines who remember the good old days when their Two-Feets, Dana and Colin, had more time to spend at home with them. Alas, Dana and Colin are both struggling artists (she a writer, he a musician), and had to get real jobs to make ends meet.<br />Fluffy and PKP realize that it's in their feline best interests to ensure that Dana and Colin are financially secure. When Dana brings home a laptop and explains the Internet and the Web to technophobe Colin, Fluffy listens in and an idea is born.<br />There's no need to go into more plot detail; suffice it to say that even though this may sound silly, the author nails cat behavior (Solar Meditation and Power Napping) and (equally as fun) cat-owner behavior (asking your cat questions and then answering for them -- Fluffy wonders how Dana gets so close to inner cat thoughts!).

I'm sure it's not the fault of the author (Trek authors are kept on tight leashes), but this book is really only a transcription of the final episode, which in itself was not that exciting (Trek motto: when in doubt, use time travel).  True, in the book we're given more of a glance into characters' thoughts, but there isn't much payoff.  For instance, when Chakotay is interrupted by the comm system while kissing Seven, the book shows us that he was REALLY frustrated instead of just frustrated (which we could see in the episode).<br />This book is also overpriced.  It should have been a mass market paperback instead of the more expensive trade paperback.  The only interesting part of the book is the preview of the upcoming &quot;Star Trek Voyager: Homecoming&quot; book.  Therefore, the alternative to a mass market paperback could have been to  make &quot;Endgame&quot; the first half of a trade paperback with the &quot;after events&quot; (those that will be depicted in &quot;Homecoming&quot;) the second half of the same book.  Now THAT would have been something to get excited about.<br />And while I'm on that topic.... perhaps &quot;Voyager&quot; would have been a better show if they had gotten home during the last episode of the SIXTH season.  Then the last season could have explored the consequences and implications of their long voyage.  Can they reintegrate into the lives of their loved ones on Earth?  Who will choose to stay with Starfleet?  Because we knew all along that Voyager would likely get home in the very last episode, the last season contained no real suspense.	2001-10-17

But the doctor as we know him didn't actually exist until the pilot episode except as a potential EMH program that had not been utilized on Voyager up to that point.  They only use the program because the flesh-and-blood doctor was killed in the pilot episode.

After her aunt buys her a health club membership, Melissa slims down and learns about hair, clothes, and make-up, only to return to school for her junior year and find that Greg's girlfriend has moved away -- leaving an empty spot on the cheerleading squad.  Melissa and her two closest friends decide to try out -- even though only one of them can be elected cheerleader, perhaps that lucky girl can help get the others into the \\"in\\" crowd.  (As you might expect, the girls learn that the in crowd is not all it's cracked up to be.) All in all, this is an enjoyable teen romance novel, although some of the situations are not entirely convincing.	2001-07-21

At the beginning of this book, Dinny is starting her high school freshman year with her 3 closest friends, and is having trouble with the fact that her friends suddenly seem more interested in boys and dating than anything else.  Dinny, on the other hand, has discovered a love of the classics (Greek and Roman ancient ruins, Latin, etc.)  Over the course of the four books, Dinny decides to save money for a trip to Europe, a very unusual goal for a young woman at the tail end of the 1950s.  The four books chart Dinny's progress in working towards this goal, interspersed with her ups and downs with friends and the boys in whom she finally becomes interested.  All in all, this series is charming and refreshing, especially compared to other young adult romances written during that time period (the 1950s and 60s).  Serious issues, such as prejudice against Dinny's new Jewish classmates, are also addressed.  I also learned a little about how the classics can hold a certain fascination for some people.	2001-07-05

This series was published by Julian Messner Inc. in the 1950s and 60s, and included dozens of titles, each focusing on a particular career path that might interest young women of the time.<br />&quot;Beth Hilton, Model&quot; is about a young girl, about to finish high school, who is dismayed by her perceived lack of grace and beauty.  She enrolls in a &quot;beauty finishing&quot; course, or charm school, where such things as posture, diction, walking, fashion, and make-up are taught.  She is so successful in this course that she begins to wonder whether she could have a career as a model, as her cousin Lisa has done for years.<br />Modeling is not overly glamorized here; the long hours are stressed, as is the discouraging practice of trudging around to photographers' studios, essentially &quot;selling yourself&quot; so that the photographers will begin calling your agency.  The most charming thing about this book, in retrospect, is the innocence of the modeling industry at the time.  This was a time when models wouldn't dream of posing in swimsuit or underwear ads, when any work-related trips they went on were fully chaperoned, when they essentially provided their own clothes for their photo shoots.  It's fun to look at this world, and the last page of the book consists of a page of advice to aspiring young girls titled &quot;If You Want to Be a Model.&quot;  Today's fashion models, who all seem to call themselves supermodels these days, would surely be amused by this!	2001-07-05

I would never have guessed that it was written by the author of &quot;The Secret Garden.&quot;  &quot;That Lass O'Lowrie's&quot; is about Joan Lowrie, a spirited young woman working in the &quot;pit&quot; (coal mines) of the village of Riggan.  Joan is the daughter of a cruel man who occasionally hits her; she makes the best of her life and reaches out to help others in need, including another young woman who gotten &quot;in trouble&quot; and has a small baby.  Joan attracts the attention of Fergus Derrick, the smart young engineer who runs the mines; Fergus also becomes friendly with the vicar's daughter, whom the local curate loves, leading into a fairly predictable love triangle....  <br />While this book is interesting, two factors weigh it down somewhat:  the heavy, heavy emphasis on religion and the long paragraphs of dialogue written in the Yorkshire dialect.  Although such passages were charming in &quot;The Secret Garden,&quot; here they are so long that they become very cumbersome to the reader.  They do lend authenticity, of course, but it may be too much for some readers.  I was also disappointed by some of the characters' silly self-sacrificing acts, which seem to be the trademark of many romances.	2001-07-05

There are a handful of these books (and books in the &quot;First Love from Silhouette&quot; series) that really stood out, and this is one of them.  Jennie, an aspiring Olympic swimmer, moves with her family from California to Texas to follow her swim coach.  Not only does she have to adjust to the football-obsessed Texans, her swimming is not going well and her mother is becoming increasingly obsessed with Jennie's swimming career.  Jennie is also falling for Mark, a former high school football star who suffered a career-ending injury.  But she's unsure whether Mark would be interested in her if he could still play football.<br />The reason this book stands out is that it's not just about dating and boys and clothes.  Jennie has a real interest, and the author knows enough about competitive swimming to make the details authentic and interesting to the reader.  You'll definitely find yourself cheering for the very likeable Jennie!	2001-07-05

This is a little gem of a book that details Monica's search for a husband near the end of the Victorian era in England.  Monica is not a man-chasing, mercenary type, but her mother has brought her up to recognize that a woman's social success depends entirely on her ability to catch a husband, particularly at a time when eligible men seem to be in short supply.<br />This is not a novel of action, but rather of subtle interplay between Monica, her domineering yet loving mother, and various friends of the family.  It is poignant and fascinating, and has a setting filled with lavish detail.  If you enjoy Edith Wharton in particular, you will likely enjoy this book as well.	2001-07-04

Although the settings are fantastical, the paintings are realistic rather than cartoonish or childish in any way, so that the cats look absolutely real.  Both adults and childrens can enjoy this beautiful book.	2001-07-04

I do not read much in the way of &quot;popular fiction&quot; (Danielle Steel, Nora Roberts, Jackie Collins, etc.), but I read  &quot;Class Reunion&quot; by Rona Jaffe when I was a teenager.  Back then, of course, I was probably looking for the racy parts, but the characters stayed with me and I reread the book a number of times over the years.<br />I was thrilled when &quot;After the Reunion&quot; was published, and read it immediately.  And now, when I feel like revisiting familiar characters (&quot;comfort reading,&quot; I call it), I reread &quot;After the Reunion&quot; rather than &quot;Class Reunion.&quot;  I like the way the characters learn to take charge of their lives in so-called middle age, and escape their rigid 1950s upbringings.  They show that it's never too late to change your life for the better!  I also like that we get details on the next generation as well, specifically Annabelle's daughter Emma and Emily's daughter Kit.  Annabelle and Chris, however, remain my favorite characters throughout both books.<br />If you are looking for involving fiction that follows several characters, pick up both these books.  Definitely read &quot;Class Reunion&quot; first, but don't forget &quot;After the Reunion&quot; as well.	2001-07-04

There are approximately 80 pages with 1 or 2 prints appearing on each 2-page spread, as well as information about the artists and the historical context of each print.  The prints themselves are lovely, with that tranquil quality that so much Japanese art seems to possess.  This book is a pleasure to hold and look at, and the reader can choose whether to read the unobstrusive text or simply enjoy the prints alone.	2001-07-04
US	52569778	R1MHVOV5GGKG6Z	0312876882	780300410	Limit of Vision	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Thought-provoking SF	In my opinion, &quot;Limit of Vision&quot; is tied with &quot;The Bohr Maker&quot; for Nagata's best book (&quot;Bohr&quot; has some really neat ideas; &quot;Limit&quot; is more accessible).  She has always concentrated on nanotechnology, but a few of her books have been difficult to follow.  &quot;Limit of Vision,&quot; on the other hand, can be read by even those who aren't intimately familiar with SF.<br />&quot;Limit&quot; is thought-provoking in that it made me wonder how I would react to this situation:  protect the LOVs because they're an exciting new lifeform, and humanity could use a little competition?  Or hunt down the LOVs because they may pose a serious threat to humanity since they obviously cannot be easily contained?  There is also a great deal of social commentary, as in how humanity chooses to deal with displaced persons.  I also enjoyed Nagata's extrapolations of how the Internet may work in the future.<br />Nagata's writing is not your run-of-the-mill SF.  She's definitely worth checking out.	2001-06-06
US	52569778	RJMEVMKPZFUP0	0886779049	321390679	Changing Vision (Web Shifters)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Some of the best alien cultures ever depicted in SF.	As with &quot;Beholder's Eye,&quot; in &quot;Changing Vision&quot; Czerneda creates and describes beautifully detailed alien biologies, cultures, and languages (the Ganthor and Ket species remain my personal favorites).  It was a stroke of genius to create Esen, a shape-shifter WITH LIMITS.  Every time Esen becomes Human, for example, she becomes the SAME Human, and will retain any scars incurred while in that form.  In addition, she must consume living mass in order to shift from shape to shape.  Without these limitations, she would be too powerful to be an interesting character, and would be able to shape-shift into a table or a vase, like Odo on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, which is a little too silly to be believeable.<br />Plotwise, this book became slightly confusing at the end, with crosses and double-crosses and triple-crosses.  At first I wasn't sure whether or not to be pleased about Paul's resolution, but it has been growing on me since I finished the book and have given it more thought.  There is also a nice cliffhanger teaser that doesn't make the reader feel cheated -- &quot;Changing Vision&quot; is still a complete story within itself.	2001-04-24

(The subtitle of the book indicates that these series are featured, but it is still not necessarily clear that they are the only series in the book.)  That being said, this book is clearly a labor of love by a person who knows what he's talking about.  There is intelligent discussion on collecting books, cleaning old books, estimating values, and different formats.<br />And then... the pictures.  This book includes full color photographs of all the book covers in their various incarnations.  For instance, on one page are placed the FOUR different covers for Nancy Drew's &quot;The Clue of the Broken Locket.&quot;  It's fun to see how the covers evolved over the years, and the author offers much historical information about the cover artists, the Stratemeyer Syndicate in general, and the various editions in which the books have been offered.  The other series mentioned above are treated in a similar manner.  Overall this is an attractively designed book that can give pleasure whether you browse leisurely or read closely.  Enjoy!	2001-02-15
US	52569778	R2AFZO9XS9QTWX	0312868022	298039166	The Jazz	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Fascinating view of the future of the Internet	Melissa Scott's &quot;The Jazz&quot; is a smart, hip look at the future of the Internet and the future of entertainment media in our culture, and where the two shall meet.  The term &quot;jazz&quot; refers to the  placement of false or hoax information on the net, which among the elite is  considered to be an artform.  Keyz, a 16 year old hoping to become a jazz  &quot;player&quot;, hacks something he shouldn't and ends up on the run.   Lucky for him, he's helped by Tin Lizzy, an experienced player who knows  the streets, both cyber and real.<br />My only minor quibbles are that Keyz is  underdevloped as a character, and the ending is a little too quick to be  satisfying.  Tin Lizzy is well-rendered, however, and the descriptions of  surfing the net are truly interesting.  It's not hard to believe that the  future Scott describes may be the way we're headed.  For another, different  version of the future Internet, I also recommend Shariann Lewitt's  &quot;Interface Masque&quot;.	2000-05-19
