But when a friend gave me this book to read and told me that I might like it, I was a bit skeptical because I believed wine could be told only in technical and sometimes boring terms.<br /><br />I just had no idea it would be such a charming and enjoyable reading.<br /><br />The book is very unpretentious, written with lots of charm and fun - and especially with love. The story starts by explaining the long road the authors took before becoming wine columnists for the Wall Street Journal. It is delightful to discover how many years two people spent on discovering wines, learning about what they like, learning how to distinguish good ones from bad ones, and going on trips to wineries around the world. It is an honest and sincere story about how they discovered the unique pleasures wine can give. All that seasoned with their love for each other, and of course for wines.<br /><br />I have to admit that there are some parts in the book where I think they may have stressed their private lives too much -- such as how much they struggled to conceive their first child, or how much their houses cost. But the story remains above all a captivating telling about their love story and wine.<br /><br />I don't think there is anything more beautiful and enjoyable than a couple and their discovery of another shared love  - in this case, the love for wine. But, of course, this is a very subjective view and wine plays a central role, and so I recommend the book only to those who enjoy reading about wine.	2005-06-18

Moreover, she despises him, all of a sudden.<br />The search for the reasons which led to this sudden change of feelings, makes Moravia rewrite a modern versin of Ulyse's myth. In a few words, Penelope did not love Ulyse anymore, though she remained faithful to him even before he left  for Troja. Why did she not love him? Because  the king's behaviour was not masculine enough towards her admirers at the court.<br />Therefore, Ulyse wins his wife's contempt and consequently leaves for Troja to free himself in a way. After the war, he postpones sine die his return to Ithaca, obessed by the same thing: Penelope's contempt.<br />When he finally decides to go back home, he knows he has no other solution but to violently kill all Penelope's admirers, in order to get her admiration and love.<br />And this is how Homer can be well combined with Freud. The moravian style, vivid and direct, manifests itself  in this novel, keeping alive the pleasure of your reading.<br />I think Alberto Moravia is one of the greatest Italian writers of all times. All his novels deal with important issues our society has to face, problems we all have. Many of us will recognize ourselves in his characters.<br />It will be a very challenging reading that will make you ask a lot of questions about yourself and your life. Enjoy it!	2004-05-31

I simply love the flavors of fresh basil, cheese, fresh pasta or tomatoes that give wonderful taste to whatever I cook.<br />For the most part of it, the book is well written. It contains a lot of details about the ingredients generally used (Lidia writes some nice &quot;essays&quot; about olives, Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, mushrooms, truffles).<br />There are enough suggestions for antipasti, soups, fresh and hard pasta, meats, fish, risotto, gnocchi. The names of the recepies are also in Italian, and so you can impress your guests with your Italian knowledge. They are not complicated, easy to do, even for someone who is not very experienced in the kitchen.<br />But I have to say that I saw better books on the topic. This one does not contain a very wide range of ideas for cooking and compared to the book I bought from Rome last year, it is a bit costy. It would have been even better if each receipe was accompanied by suggestions of wines to serve with the dish. Information about how difficult and expensive it is to make that dish would have made the book more valuable.<br />However, it is an interesting introduction to Italian cooking and it does not miss the well-known and famous recepies.	2004-03-17

I have always enjoyed drinking wines, but I never knew how to combine them with food, distinguish a good wine from a bad one or how to read a label. I had read some books about this topic before, but none of them was good enough for my level.<br />This book answered all the questions I had. It is the first step that a beginner has to take in the fascinating world of wines, in order to enjoy more what they drink.<br />In a very easy to understand language, the authors explain everything you need to know about different types of wine, grapes, how to taste a wine, vintages, what a wine consists of and what we should take into account when we taste it.<br />Then the reader is presented in details the most important wine regions of the world. It has very interesting tips and charts about wines that you should try at least once in your life.<br />The explanations are so clear and specific, that at the end of the book you will realise you have no more questions. Read each chapter attentively and try to remember every detail. Only after having done that, move on to the next chapter. So, you won't mix wine denominations, types of grapes and areas.<br />The book is very entertaining and concise, by far one of the best manuals.<br />After having read that, I promise, you will no longer be afraid to order a wine in a restaurant or will know what bottle to buy in a wine store by simply reading its label.<br />Also, don't forget to practice what you read. Everytime you have a bottle of wine on your table, open the book and read. Next time you will remember easily that specific wine, the grapes it was made of and its taste.<br />The are only two things I regret about the book: it is not updated (the vintage charts end in 1996) and it does not have attached a video tape. It would have been more useful in order to understand better certain chapters.	2004-03-15

This is the kind of book that I recommend to everyone. It is a very useful guide for people who find it difficult sometimes to face changes of any kind. It takes you less than one hour to read it, but the insights you will find there are unique and will be of great help.<br />It is a funny story about four characters who live in a maze and look for cheese to nourish them and make them happy. Of course, the cheese is only a metaphor for what people want to do in life (a good job, a relationship, money, health, etc.). Life is seen here as a maze, the place where we look for what we want.<br />I was fortunate to participate also in a training course on this book, which really helped me understand even better its meanings. I think that many people from my company should read that!<br />I highly recommend this book to all who want to learn how to deal with change in life, so that they will suffer less and enjoy more success.	2003-12-23

This is the first book I have read from Osho, and I will say that he did a very good job in explaining important things, using few words and pages. It is a little book that will not take you much time to read. What will take longer is thinking about the important points the book makes.<br /><br />One thing that is important to understand is that this is not a book about sex, at least not in the usual way. So if you are looking for tricks about how to improve your sex life, you are in the wrong place. Instead, this is a work that will give you a different perspective of what sex should be and mean. Is it only for people who believe in the spirit and spiritual evolution.<br /><br />It will also tell you that the lessons that religion and church sometimes teach -- that sex is sinful, etc. -- is completely mistaken. The book states that it is this teaching we received while young that made this society depraved.<br /><br />Osho considers that our contemporary society completely forgot about the sacramental and fundamental role mankind once gave to sex. From his point of view, a sexual experience should be a thoughtful act, an experience of love, a means to reach what is beyond our consciousness.<br />The journey to from sex to to what Osho calls Samadhi (the divine ecstasy) is long, but this should be our final goal. The kind of love that we all know and desire is only the first step. But people who refuse even this first step will never be able to reach the second and from this point of view they will never evolve spiritually.<br /><br />The main point is that sex is not a end to itself, it is only the beginning, it is only a means through which people who understand the subject correctly can reach the final goal - the \\"super consciousness.\\"<br /><br />If you are not interested in topics like spirituality and spiritual evolution, I think you should not buy this book. But if you are open to this, reading Sex Matters will be an extremely interesting and challenging experience that will give you a different take on life. Enjoy!ill give you a different take on life.

Both of them are very documented and serious writings and I have to admit I was a bit reserved at the idea of Umberto Eco writing humorous essays.<br />But it was enough for me to read only the first story (How to Travel with a Salmon) and I decided I had to read the whole book.<br />This is the book that will give you a nice feeling, sometimes will make you even laugh out loud, as it is written with a lot of wit and sense of humour.<br />It is suitable for someone who wants a light reading and intelligent at the same time.<br />I was pleasantly surprised to meet the playful side of Mr. Eco which resulted in light satires at the address of some social institutions, bureaucracy and habits that people have. It is a delightful reading that I bet, you don't want to miss.	2003-12-09

Set in Mussolini's Rome, the elegant and readable story is full of the kinds of complexities and frustrations real life provides.<br />Adriana is an unforgettable character, somehow maintaining her innocence and hope despite descending into what her society would call scandalous circumstances. Through her strength alone, it seems, the story manages to end with a touch of optimism.<br />The reputation of this book precedes it, and so I won't spend more time describing the plot or heaping more superlatives on what is likely the best book to come from Alberto Moravia, one of Italy's most underrated authors.<br />Read The Woman of Rome, and even if it touches you only a<br />fraction of the extent to which it touched me, that will be more than most books can aspire to.	2003-11-28

Or how can a youngman, who thoroughly studied philosophy, fall deeply in love, without thinking too much and asking himself too many questions?<br />The beginning of the story happens in the sky, in a British Airways flight. And after that, as it happens in every love story, both protagonists come down to earth. And this is the moment when everything starts.<br />The story of this novel is simplicity itself: a love affair, from its very beginning to its very end. De Botton's narrator describes falling in love with Chloe, being in love with her, and then getting over her, actually a quite banal thing. But what makes the book interesting and captivating is the way he manages to show everyday love in characters who are not particularly appealing, considering all aspects of love, especially the everyday and trivial.<br />According to Alain de Botton, there are two ways to understand love: a mystical one, or at least mythical, and a philosophical one. This book takes both ways seriously and banters them gracefully. On one hand we have signs, destiny, romantic fatalism, Cupid and on the other we have Plato and Kant. I am sure that many of you will recognize themselves in the stories the author tells and will admit that he or she said or did the same things when was in love.<br />I also have to say that Alain de Botton is prone to think too much sometimes and makes big deal out of small things,  philosophizes a lot.<br />And so I found the story difficult to follow at times, which prevented me from fully enjoying the narrative.<br />Despite this, this little book is very clever, written with a lot of common sense, nerve and surprises (the story is full of drawings, charts and diagrams) and it can be read by the ones who are cheated or dissapointed by a love story. It is well written and fun to be read.<br />It is something that will remind you that some things should not be always taken too seriously.	2003-11-07

If I had read La Ciociara when I was a student, I would have definitely enjoyed it much more.<br />This is the story of a mother and her daughter, forced to leave their home in Rome and live for one year near the front in Gargliano (Italy) between 1943 and 1944.<br />Alberto Moravia himself was forced to do the same thing during Wold War II and hid in the mountains during the German occupation. Knowing that most of the narration is based on real personal experiences, gives the book more charm and color.<br />The book is not about the war in its traditional meaning, but about human experience and what the profanatory war can bring about. The narration deals with two acts of violence: war and rape. (Initially the author wanted to name his book &quot;Lo Stupro&quot; - The Rape)<br />After a war and after a rape, neither a country nor a woman are what they used to be before. Profound changes take place, both country and woman pass from the state of innocence and integrity to bitter knowledge. In fact, all wars penetrating the territory of a country and hitting civil population can be considered rapes.<br />But despite the interesting and well drawn characters, the book is boring at times. This is literature written the two World Wars, so don't have too high expectations.<br />It was an interesting experience and I admire Alberto Moravia talent for writing. But I believe, I would have been more delighted about the book if I had read it at the age of 18 or 20.<br />If you are Italians or big fans of the Italian literature, then I believe it would be a good idea for you to read this book. Otherwise, you don't miss anything.	2003-09-16

The beauty comes also from the understated sensuality and passion that derives from the plot, as well as from the &quot;silence&quot; that this book gives off. You can feel there is no need for too many words - too much has already been told.<br />The whole story is written with a soft pen, as if instead of ink, the writer used silk. This is perfect to create the a subtle and exotic atmosphere. In only 100 pages one can find out about Herve Joncourt and his life, his wife, his business partners, his travels to Japan, the imposibility to fight and win his love and touch his dream.<br /><br />I don't want to say too much about Silk, as I would like you to convince yourselves that it is just breathtaking.	2003-09-15

It is not a piece of literature that requires great deals of concentration. No way!  But it is an easy-to-read and captivating story, which shows that Ira Levin has plenty of imagination and a gift for creating suspense.<br /><br />The story takes place in 1974 and involves Dr. Mengele, known as the Angel of Death, a famous figure in the concentration camp of Auschwitz during World War II. In the story, he is involved in a crazy and revolutionary project, designed to lay new seeds for the Aryan dominance in the world.<br /><br />I admire the writer's gift for creating vivid dialogue and a well built story so compelling that it was difficult for me to put the book aside, just what I wanted for perfect reading at the seaside.	2003-09-01

This provides the background for the story, which turns out to be more about the people of a small Caribbean village with their morals, manners, and way of thinking and perceiving the world. It makes for a story that is at once very captivating and challenging.<br /> <br />It is intriguing to note that everybody in the story knows that Nasar was to be killed but nobody took the action to prevent the murder. Instead of warning poor Nasar, the villagers gathered around to watch the exciting and horrible event.<br /> <br />This book is different from the best known style of Garcia Marquez, magical realism. This time the story is more traditional, but nonetheless carried along by the charm of a master story teller.<br /> <br />The events and the details unfold little by little unfold, centered on an unanswered question: was Nasar indeed the one who took Angela's virginity? This creates a kind of suspense that makes the book even more compelling, leaving room for speculation.<br />This is simply a great book, well written, compact, and definitely not to be missed by anyone wishing to experience another piece of Garcia Marquez's talent. The journalistic approach of telling the events - combined with the satire towards religion, legal system, morals, and the irony - combine to make the book a wonderful piece of literature.	2003-08-12

In general, I am a great admirer of Paolo Coelho's work. I enjoy the simplicity of his style a lot and the topics he chooses for his novels. But while this book is interesting and challenging, it is too mystical for my taste.<br /><br />The book is even more fantasy oriented than the Alchemist, introducing us into an unbelievable world of angels and saints. Here, the author sets himself on a journey to see and talk to his guardian angel. He is accompanied by his wife, who balances Paolo's faith, as she is skeptical about her husband's practices and faiths.<br /><br />We are introduced into an occult world, a context full of mystical rituals, some of them quite frightening. In the Mojave Desert, Paolo meets the Valkyries, a band of bold women dressed in leather riding on motorbikes, who spread the word of angels.<br /><br />Despite the many unbelievable experiences which give you the feeling that the book is only for the &quot;initiated ones&quot;. I still believe it is enchanting; a lot of this charm comes from the fact that is it very personal.<br />I recommend this book only to the very mystical personalities.	2003-08-04

But this story is a contemporary quest, and it has an interesting and exciting mix of ancient and modern, that in the end leads to learning and understanding the truth.<br /><br />It is the road that Paolo has to take in order to defend his sword and that will turn him into a Warrior of Light. He is accompanied by his spiritual guide, Petrus, with whom he will walk about 800 km over three months, during which time he will confront himself with his own fears, thoughts, doubts, and weaknesses. It is a pilgrimage that will explain to our main character (and implicitly to us) that our efforts in life are salutary and indispensable. But without results they amount to nothing.<br />Also, the story shows that love makes us stronger and it is this strength that allows us to make the right decision at the right time.<br /><br />The search of truth is assimilated to a personal search for meaning, for the things that we need in life such as truth, love, joy of life, and spirituality.<br /><br />I think it will be a very pleasant lecture for everyone who enjoys this kind of story, and it will make you think a lot about your life and the meaningful things in your personal universe.	2003-07-30

When I really think about it, the worst thing I can say about Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter is that I did not want the book to end so soon. Like all great books, the story transported me to another place, in this case it is Lima in the 1950s. Here, aunts like fiction but they don't enjoy literature. And scriptwriters don't write literature, but produce large quantities of fiction.<br /><br />Before the appearance of television, in Peru, the radio theatre (the ancestor of today's soap operas) was an important presence in the lives of the citizens of Lima. At Radio Central, a scriptwriter, Pedro Camacho, uses that stage to manipulate his audience's need for tales of horror and love.<br />At Radio Panamericana, a young news editor cuts articles out of the local newspapers and rewrites them for news bulletins. He checks his collaborator's appetite for catastrophes and falls in love with his aunt, a newly divorced Bolivian who comes to Lima in search for a profitable match.<br /><br />The book is actually a slightly fictionalized account of Vargas Llosa's life as a university student. His unusual love story gets out of control, just as the prolific Pedro Camacho's radio scripts start to get out of the control.<br /><br />I enjoyed the narrative a great deal, the interweaving of different stories involving Vargas Llosa's love story and the tales of the eccentric  \\"scriptwriter\\".<br />His stories have a very important meaning - they are unforgettable depictions of Peru of the '50s, with well drawn characters. They act as representatives of Peruvian society, wealthy or poor, intellectual or not so intellectual, everyone with his or her own shortcomings and problems. They are all presented with tongue in cheek, in a well-written realistic story.	2003-07-28

But now that I have read this book, I can say that the same mixed feelings that made me put off reading it have become even stronger.<br /><br />On the one hand, in many ways the book seems to be insightful and useful for improving a relationship. But at the same time, it also seems to make problems appear too simple. Author John Gray seems to describe solutions for everything, to every little problem that can interfere with the development of a relationship. But anyone who has ever been in a serious relationship knows that practice is always different from theory.<br /><br />The central point in the book is that men and women &quot;speak&quot; different languages in regard to the way they perceive and value a relationship. Gray says that the secret of success consists of understanding the other's language, psychology, and perceptions. Most of the rest of the book is simply made up of specific examples of the way this main theory is applied.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this book is worth reading. It will teach you interesting ways to interpret the actions of your partner, many of which you may not have thought of. But it is important to understand that this volume will not work miracles, and that the kind of help it offers will not make your relationship work perfectly by itself. The best way to look at this book as an interesting guide that will give you some interesting perspectives and worthwhile clues for improving communication. It is also a relaxing and fun read.	2003-07-09

At the end there is a special chapter with cheese recipes for snacks, salads, pastries, desserts, a very interesting and inspiring chapter for cheese-based dishes.<br />There is only one suggestion I can make regarding this book: it would have been more interesting if each cheese denomination and description would have been accompanied by a map of the country and the location of the area where the cheese comes from.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a great book that should be on every cheese-lovers shelf; every time you open it, you'll discover that there is something you haven't tried yet and you should.<br /><br />Buy this book and take time to enjoy it!	2003-06-18

After a while he brought it up again and finally convinced me by reading me one whole chapter that made me laugh a lot. I am glad I finally gave in to this delightful and fascinating book.<br />It's been a long time since I have read a book which combines so perfectly humour, curiosity, intelligence, a very vivid language, and nice adventures of discovering the world.<br /><br />Basically, the book speaks about the exploits of the Nobel Prize winner in Physics, Richard Feynman, an incredibly brilliant mind who was part of the research team that made the atomic bomb, but who doesn't know that if you put milk in your tea, you should not have lemon at the same time. Nor is he very good at socializing with women, yet he is a successful visiting professor at the most important universities in the US where he gives very challenging lectures.<br /><br />These contrasting features make Richard Feynman a very appealing and lively character, and his book is a series of hilarious events that make you laugh out loud. He is so smart that he can break a safe in less than 15 minutes and so he made a habit of playing tricks on his colleagues by breaking the secret codes for their safes.<br /><br />A multilateral personality, he studied also biology, art (he took art lessons and sold a few paintings), music. He was a scientist but not the stiff type; on the contrary, he was a very funny personality, full of sense of humour, with a childlike curiosity who tells his story with an incredible sincerity, a free spirit and enjoyable character.<br /><br />It is a book I highly recommend for different reasons: readers will have the chance to meet a rare and admirable personality in a narrative marked with good quality humour.	2003-06-17
US	32394234	R27286C9RGQ9CP	0380012863	129257055	Jonathan Livingston Seagull	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Good 'flying' lesson	I was first recommended this book a few years ago, and I admit it did not sound very stimulating to me when I read the first paragraphs. Reading more than 100 pages about birds was not the book that I wanted to read at that moment.<br />But a few weeks ago my friend mentioned it and I thought it was time to start reading it and see what was all about.<br />I have to admit that it was a great experience and the moment I started to read I simply could not put the book aside. I felt great when I finished it and it made me think that life can also be nice and full of optimistic things. 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' is one of them.<br />  This is a very nice fable about life, ambition and pushing one's own limits. The more you read it, the more you start asking questions about yourself and your life.<br />  Jonathan Livingston is a seagull that chooses a different path than  the rest of the birds in his flock. He spends his days looking for perfection - he prefers to learn to fly rather than eat, unlike the other birds. He is single-minded focus on and flying is not the way to make him popular with other birds. Such an attitude made Jonathan an outcast, rejected by his community and he finds himself alone but doesn't want to give up his dreams and ideas.<br />  I think the one big thing this story teaches us is that we should all admit our limitations, but the secret consists in trying to get over them, to challenge ourselves and evolve.<br />  Only great challenges will make us reach &quot;heaven&quot;, which is just a matter of being perfect. If there is no challenge, then there are no failures and  we cannot evolve. Only excellence,<br />intelligence, and skill can set free a spirit that is looking<br />for important challenges in life.<br />  Richard Bach, who is an accomplished pilot and who has written a great deal about flight, uses the theme of flying in this book as a way of making us think. We have to think of ourselves as creatures of total freedom, free from all rulesin our minds, the place where actually everything happens. We can fly at the speed of our minds, not limited by anything .<br />  I think the book is also a story about  modern society, where people who are different, the ones who want to make a change, are seen as crazy and are often rejected by the society that tends to be more and more ordinary, with limited views, and no dreams  or desires.<br />  It is a good story  from which we can learn a lot of things: never be afraid of reaching perfection, never stop dreaming. It is a short and very easy to read  story, written in a very nice language, full of deep meanings. I think it should guide us all in life. I recommend this book to all of you who want to be different and &quot;fly high&quot;. You will love it!m all rulesin our minds, the place where actually everything happens.

That was before my friend gave me this book<br />as a gift and I must say it was exactly what I needed.<br />  It helped me understand about the different types of grapes and wines,<br />their specific characteristics, how to taste a wine, which wines are to be<br />consumed younger and which ones are to be left for aging. I also found out<br />about the influence of the soil on the vine's growing, the harvest time for<br />each type of wine, etc.<br /> I think this book is a good start for someone who would like to be<br />initiated in the amazing world of wines and also for those who already know<br />well wines.<br />  This book is very detailed and discusses every wine region of the world<br />(Europe, South Africa, Australia, new Zealand, South America, etc.),<br />mentioning its wine producers, the history of the area, the climate and in<br />certain parts it also gives suggestions about specific food that can be<br />combined with the wine of the area.<br />  Regions like France, South Africa, Germany, USA, Australia, are very<br />detailed presented, with maps and informations about every single producer<br />in the area. If you want to take a vacation and visit some wine areas, this<br />book is everything you need.<br />  Unfortunately, regions like Eastern Europe don't offer so much<br />information, despite the fact that they have a big potential, but are not<br />historically so well known.<br />  This is not something to read once and then put it aside. It is meant to<br />be kept within easy reach and read from it every time you taste a new wine<br />and want to find more about its origin and history. Knowing all these<br />things, it will make you understand better its personality and perhaps you<br />will enjoy it more.<br />  I'm sure you will like the experience of reading from this book./>    I'm sure you will like the experience of reading from this book.	2003-06-03

First, it's about fighting and beating cancer and then on a second level it is about the world of cycling. I am not and have never been a competitive cyclist or even a fan of the sport, but you don't have to be a fan to read this book - it's just a wonderful and emotional testimony of a very dedicated cyclist fighting a deadly disease.<br />It is not a literary masterpiece, but there is a very good lesson about survival on almost every page of it.<br />You will find this book very easy to be read, with a style that is simple and concise. But most importantly, you will find out what is like to become sick and unable to do something once taken for granted, from a very active and hard working athlete and then return to the stage and win one of the most difficult contests in the world: Tour de France.<br />You will find that the best way to win in life is to turn a serious obstacle into an opportunity and make a negative become a positive. I think these are ideas that should guide us all the time.<br /><br />Was the hero's survival a miracle? Or just determination? Lance wonders himself: \\"The question that lingers is, how much was I a factor in my own survival and how much was science and how much miracle?...[P]ersonally I'm content with simply being alive to enjoy the msytery.\\"<br />I recommend you to buy this book: I think it will change your vision of things a great deal and I promise you, you won't put it down until you finish it.	2003-05-14

A reader of this book said that 'the first law of successful marketing is to read and understand this book'. I agree with that and say that it is a must-read for everyone working in marketing.<br /><br />I have been working in this field for almost 5 years and I have realised that marketing people tend to have a wide variety of their own ideas about marketing and how to do it. I know that in this field a lot of the success comes from 'the unsual' and 'the uncommon' strategies, but it also comes from certain rules that have to be respected, because a history of more than 25 years proved that they work.<br /><br />This book is meant to eliminate myths and misconceptions someone might have about the marketing process. Companies spend millions of dollars on marketing thinking that they are chosing the best way to promote their products. But no matter how extraordinary those programs are, sometimes they fail and bring no benefit to the product or the service they promote. The result destroys the identity of the brands, market share decreases, and so do sales. Companies lose a lot of money.<br /><br />The two authors have a  lot of experience in this field and their theories are based clear examples. If marketing people would adjust their promotional programs according to these rules, companies would be much more successful.<br /><br />There are 22 rules in total, applicable to every field, rules that will make you understand why things are the way they are. It will also help you analyse past experience and decide what was wrong and right and avoid doing the same mistakes in the future.<br /><br />It is not an academic book . The language and style are accessible to everybody. The authors give a lot of examples from companies' life that will give you a very clear picture of what is going on the market.<br /><br />Did you know that it is better for a brand to be first on the market than it is to be better? Did you know that the most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospect's mind?<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone who wants to learn more about marketing and become a professional in this field. Together with Kotler's &quot;Marketing Management', the '22 Immutable laws ...' should be the marketing people's Bible to be read every day.<br />I am sure it will improve your activities and help you achieve more success.spect's mind?<BR> <BR>I recommend this book to everyone who wants to learn more about marketing and become a professional in this field.

This book shares the same theme as 'The Alchemist', the theme of the quest, seen as a journey that takes the main character far from his own country. 'The Fifth Mountain' begins with a reference to 'The Alchemist' and the author repeats the central idea of his first book: `when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it'. This book can be considered a sequel, although the content is different. But in principle, the idea remains the same: how to to accept and carry the responsibility of living one's`destiny'.<br />The main character is prophet Elijah, a Biblical figure who set out the conditions for the coming of the Messiah, and eventually, after he was thoroughly tested was sent up to Heaven. His mission from God was to restore His worship in Israel, for the king there had married a foreign princess, who was introducing her own gods to the people.<br />The text of the book in itself is very simple, but the message is very powerful: only by confronting what is most important to you, and so confronting yourself at your most vulnerable, you can climb the wall of frustrations that keeps you from what you desire, which gives meaning to your life.<br />To what point can we predict our own destiny? - this is the main question in the book and Im sure many of us tried to find an answer. Elijah is sometimes torn between the desire to serve God and the needs of those he has come to love. But the reader will find out that love and faith will eventually triumph over. Only love and faith will help our hero get over the difficulties.<br />Here you can find some quotations from the book - Im sure it will make you want to read it:<br />- '... a man must choose... therein lies his strength: the power of his decisions... he who makes no choice is dead in the eyes of the Lord...'<br />- 'There is no tragedy, only the unavoidable. Everything has its reason for being: you only need to distinguish what is temporary from what is lasting.'<br /><br />- 'If you have a past that dissatisfies you, then forget it now.'<br />- 'A child can teach an adult three things:  to be happy for no reason, to always be busy with something, and to know how to demand with all his might that which he desires.'<br />- 'Take advantage of the chance that tragedy has given you; not everyone is capable of doing so.'<br />- 'Sadness does not last forever when we walk in the direction of that which we always desired.'<br />- &quot;There are inevitable moments of misfortune which interrupt our lives. However, they happen for a reason.&quot; Sometimes the world seems to have conspired against us, and so we ask ourselves, &quot;Why does this have to happen to me?&quot; Confronted by the inevitable, some of us become discouraged; others, however, grow stronger and increase their understanding.'<br />Is there anything else I should say to help you decide read this book? Im sure you wont regret this experience.'If you have a past that dissatisfies you, then forget it now.'<br />- 'A child can teach an adult three things:  to be happy for no reason, to always be busy with something, and to know how to demand with all his might that which he desires.'<br />- 'Take advantage of the chance that tragedy has given you; not everyone is capable of doing so.'<br />- 'Sadness does not last forever when we walk in the direction of that which we always desired.'<br />- &quot;There are inevitable moments of misfortune which interrupt our lives.

It is true, 'By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept' can be considered a fable, as well as a love story set in the present, having some similarities with 'The Alchemist'.<br />This is another journey (actually most of Coelho's books are journeys) to self dicovery and rediscovery of faith. Pilar, the main character, sets up for her journey to regain trust in God and fall in love again, no matter how much it may hurt.<br />However, nobody can deny the beauty of this book which is well worth reading, Coelho being here an artist at describing feelings, confusions, states of mind.<br />Full of deep meanings, warmth, joy and unexpected sorrow, the story is a celebration of the many possibilities life has to offer, and a fable about opening your heart to miracles.<br />It is also about searching for wisdom, in the French Pyrenees, and learning the wisdom inherent in loving. The `spiritual path can only be travelled through the daily experience of love', and that is why `sooner or later, we have to overcome our fears'. Pilar and her lover, make this journey together and finally get to understand its meaning. They are fictitious characters, `but they represent the many conflicts that beset us in our search for love'.<br />Coelho touches here upon another interesting point: the feminine face of God. We find out of God's feminine face, that all religions all over the world have a Goddess figure, a Virgin Mary, a Great Mother, though her presence, or importance, may seem to have been forgotten. And it is she who encourages us to love, for loving a partner, and marrying, is the only way of serving God. Coelho's parable reflects the interest and fascination with the feminine side of God. The other key to the story is expressed by the author in an introductory note: &quot;Spiritual experience is above all a practical experience of love. And with love, there are no rules.&quot;<br />I am sure this will be a very interesting and unforgettable experience for all of you who decide to read this book.be a very interesting and unforgettable experience for all of you who decide to read this book.	2003-05-09

This is an extraordinary story about optimism, hope, courage and perseverance. It is about finding out what is our 'mission' in life, about destiny and following our dreams - whenever one wishes something, the whole universe conspires to its realisation. Everything is possible as long as we really want this to happen.<br />At the first level, the story seems to be very simple, and as Coelho himself said it, &quot;simple things are the most valuable and only wise people appreciate them&quot;. But it is by far a very complex story with very deep meanings.<br />One of the things suggested here is that people who don't dare to follow their dreams, their 'Personal Myth', will have a superficial and empty life.<br />It is also about being courageous to meet your destiny, to dare making your dreams come true and following the road that has been made for them, and find God while searching for their destiny and their mission on earth.<br />Another important issue in this book is finding your soul-mate and love - the core of existence and creation. When we are in love we try to improve ourselves: &quot;I love you because the whole universe conspired for me to come close to you.&quot;<br />I think this book can be enjoyed by everybody, because we all find ourselves in Santiago, the main character of the book - we all have dreams, desires and perhaps some us dont have the necessary courage to follow our dreams - and courage is the language that helps you most in understanding the world.<br />I recommend this book to everybody who thinks that life is still beautiful and even to those who believe the opposite - Im sure it will make you change your minds.	2003-04-29

Its something magic that wont let you put the book aside until you finish it. This is what happened when I read these short stories, so skilfully and wonderfully written.<br />The book has a short introduction about the mission of the writer in this world, about how fragile inspiration is and how quickly stories can be changed, characters' destinies having a different ending. And how many years it takes to write something valuable.<br />I wont write here about the topics of his stories, but I will say that you will love every character and story, as they are very well described, complex, each and everyone having something outstanding. They are normal people, aparently living their lives in our world but in reality living in an universe created by themselves. These stories are not about action and plot, but about different personalities, everyone with his fascinating story that will take into a magical world.<br />Dont read this book on a train or bus or airplane.

Im not a native English speaker, and sometimes, or most of the times, reading fiction in another language is not that easy. It can be even frustrating for the fact that you have to look up words in the dictionary every 2 minutes and so you lose the thread of the story, being obliged to focus on understanding the words.This did not happen with John Irving's book and I must say Im very glad I understood 90 % of the story without using a dictionary.<br />(Warning: plot elements revealed from this point on)<br />There are a lot of things in this book that are intriguing to me: Ruth is a very famous writer, who doesnt seem to need a rich life experience in order to be a successful writer. From my point of view it is questionable how she can write about such issues (marriage, divorce, birth, motherhood, death)and be so successful, without having lived at least one of those moments.<br />The only real 'research' she does for her book is watching a prostitute in Amsterdam while she was with a client and so she becomes the witness of a murder. That moment she makes an interesting remark: \\"The conventional vision is that prostitution is a kind of rape for money; in truth, in protitution - maybe only in prostitution - the woman seems in large\\". This is a good point about what is like for a woman to live in a sexist society, where only men can have a sexual history and women are sometimes judged by their physical appearance.<br />But I dont think Ruth is a very oustanding character. If I have to compare her to her best friend, I think that Hannah is more interesting, warm and friendly. Hannah seems to me the most vivid and funny character in this book. She is somehow vulgar and has in mind sex and lovers, but she shows a certain frankness and curiosity that not many people have. She has her sad story too, as 'real love' is late in showing up for her.<br />At the other side is Ruth, down to earth, cautious, famous, a bit distant, who gets married not because she is madly in love with Allan. No, she marries simply because she thinks that Allan is the right guy for her, the one who can take good care of her, despite the fact that she hates the way he eats or she doesnt seem to enjoy sex with him so much.<br />Important changes occur in her only after Allan's death - she is more mature, knows what she is looking for, which finally concludes in finding real love (she falls in love with Harry) and having a happy marriage.<br />It is interesting that we have 4 writers in this book, among which only Ruth is the well known among readers. Ruth writes out of her imagination, Ed can write only from his own experience and is uncapable of imagining anything - at least he is a good guy, a reliable and trustworthy friend. Tom's stories for children are in fact stories for young mothers - his main targets. Marion writes out of sorrow and grief for having lost her two sons.<br />Speaking about Marion, I keep wondering how she could have left her daughter and show up again out of the blue, after more than 30 years, not because she wanted to see her daughter and grandson, but because she found out that Ed was still in love with her.<br />I admire Irving's talent for getting into his characters' minds and telling us about everyhting they think. He is very good in making us see through their eyes.<br />But I think that the book is also about finding your way in life, being happy with yourself and coming to terms with the misfortunes in life.
