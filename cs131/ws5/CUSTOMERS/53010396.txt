Overall it provides an insightful and intriguing portrait of the life and death of Appomattox Court House, VA.  However there are some minor problems with the book that prevent it from being an outstanding book.<br />First off, the book takes several chapters to really get rolling.  The first three chapters of the book consist entirely of narrative by Marvel and no quotations from letters, diaries, newspapers or government documents.  This lack of visceral primary sources keeps the book from involving the reader in the narrative and may bore readers who aren't committed for the finish.<br />However, once the war does start, the books becomes much more active.  There are active quotations from individuals and the narrative becomes much more involved with the individuals of the town.  I really enjoyed this part of the book.  <br />Overall this is a great book.  However, Marvel doesn't go as far into the death throes of Appomattox or its restoration during the 1930's and 1940's as I would have liked.  Marvel also doesn't really do as thorough a job as I would have liked to prove his statement in his preface that Appomattox was a typical Southern town.  Other than this, it was an interesting book.	2001-06-01

U.S. Manned Space From Mercury To the Shuttle	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A memoir without pretentiousness	Deke Slayton's memoir of his life is one of the best around.  His folksy language and humble &quot;aw shucks&quot; attitude make this book an account of spaceflight from a regular joe.<br />Deke tells us the striaght story no embellishments and gives us honest opinions.  He worked around some famous people and some legends of our time, and it's fascinating to read his opinions of them.<br />Deke also takes us deep into the brotherhood of the astronauts.  It's a culture that few ever experience, and Deke gives an outsider enough information to understand it, but not to violate the privacy of the members of it.<br />Truly this is a great book.  What is most tragic is that Deke never lived to see it published.  He truly was an American Hero and his book does him credit.  It's an intelligent, humble and very readable account of one man's life as an astronaut.	2001-05-07

With an erudite but accessible style of writing, Hackett has satisfied both my love of good solid history and an enjoyable read.  <br />Fischer gives the reader a historiograhpic overview of the study of Paul Revere's ride, from the celebratory to the cynical, we are shown that this man and his actions have engendered lively debate in academia.<br />However, not many readers may give a fig about historiography.  They will however be immediately drawn into this excellent narrative account of Revere's ride, its aftermath and the thorough background provided about his life, and the life of his &quot;adversary&quot; General Gage.<br />Fischer has done something that many historians long to do, write both a readable and academically solid book.  I hope that historians can use this book as an example for how to write history, and the public will read it to see that history doesn't have to be horribly dull.	2001-04-28

I found it to be surprisingly forthright and honest about the accomplishments and mistakes that the Grumman team made during their first and only foray into manned spacecraft construction.  Students of space history and engineers will probably get the most out of this book, which is loaded with technical detail.  However, for those who read the book and come away somewhat bewildered from the acronyms and technical detail, Kelly does a very good job of conveying the excitement and enthusiasm for the challenge of landing a man on the moon that swept across America in the 1960's.  Kelly also gives us a view of the major players in Apollo like Joe Shea, Chris Kraft, and the astronauts themselves, that is not really seen.  Kelly gives us the perspective of an outsider, though an engineer, who meets these people for the first time and what it was like to work with them and what kind of an impression they left upon him.  <br />Overall, if you're a space nut, this is a good book for you, if you're not, be prepared for lots of engineering talk.  But don't let that scare you away, Moon Lander is full of goodies about Apollo for everyone.	2001-04-21

Here we are treated to the very beginnings of the US Manned Spaceflight program and a wealth of detail at the building of the infrastructure that was able to support Apollo and was coopted into supporting the Shuttle. The most interesting parts of this book are the sections on Gemini and Mercury.  Kraft was Flight during those programs and his insights and recollections are the most vibrant.  What I found intriguing was his vitriolic comments about Scott Carpenter.  Especially since nobody has ever spoken about his shortcomings as an astronaut in print before.<br />Overall, this is an excellent memoir.  I found it to be highly readable and educational for anyone interested in spaceflight.	2001-04-16

Greene's story was the basis for the script of the Carol Reed film starring Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten.  While there are some differences between the two, the heart of the plot remains the same.<br />I truly enjoyed this book, however it was a little short.  But, what it lacked in mass it made up for in an engaging plot that captures the reader until they are completely finished.  Greene's characters are complex and likeable, even the villain has a certain amount of charisma.  Fortunately for those who this book captures, it can be read in one rainy day.  And really, it should be read on a dark gray day, or else it kinda defeats the noir mood of the plot.  And I'm purposely leaving out the plot because it would ruin the twist at the end.	2001-04-03

He succeeds at this with flying colors in &quot;Crucible of War.&quot;  Using excellent prose and drawing on a large amount of primary sources, Anderson takes the reader from the backroom dealings in Parliament to the footsoldier on the march in Upstate New York.  At the same time Anderson advances a novel thesis that the French and Indian War was just an example of just how far apart the Americans and the English had grown apart, and the war merely accelerates the separation.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Seven Years War, the causes of the American Revolution and History in general.	2001-04-01

He blends a sweeping narrative with extensive analysis to explain the development of &quot;total war&quot; and its effects on Americans. What will really engage the reader is not so much Royster's examinations of General William Sherman's actions and those of his men, but rather the ideas of Stonewall Jackson and the calls for the destruction of Northern cities that they elicit from the Confederacy, a nation that was supposedly only wanted to fight a defensive war.  While Royster's argument is not without some structural flaws, it makes some very interesting points about Confederate war aims and the willingness of populations and troops of both sides to destroy the cities of their former bretheren.  I've read this book twice for graduate level classes and each time a lively discussion has been generated.  An excellent book.	2001-03-30

Of the six generals compared and contrasted by Buell, Lee comes out worse by far.  While some pro-Lee partisans would be shocked and possibly offended by Buell's very blunt criticisms of Lee's generalship, he does raise some very interesting points.        George Thomas is Buell's favorite, and he comes out best from this book.  In particular Thomas's use of improved weapons, supply, communications and advanced tactics endear him to Buell.  I found myself surprised by the fact that Thomas has been remandered to footnote status with all of these advances.      Buell's book will either generate large amounts of praise or venom from readers.  Either way it will force most Civil War buffs to reconsider their opinions about the accepted ratings of Union and Confederate generals.	2001-03-30

However, the individual qualities of each facet of the campaign suffer in deference to the whole book.   I had a problem at first with his writing style, which is written in an unusual style, something akin to 3rd person passive voice rather than a more novelized account.  It takes a few pages to get used to.   Montgomery's preface makes plain that this is not an intellectual book and contains no citations, but hey, is a bibliography too much to ask? David McCullough can put one in his books, and so can Stephen Ambrose, for a topic with so many different areas of intellectual exploration it is painful to see no references. If you got some cash to blow on a book about the Burr conspiracy, or are just desperate for a book on it, then this is for you.  If you want a good history, see what you can find at your library, I know there were a few written in the 1960's.   If you want a good account of Lewis and Clark, don't buy this book.  Undaunted Courage by Stephen Ambrose is written better and has more complete refernces.	2001-03-18

In  paritcular I enjoyed his essay on the Kilpatrick-Dahlgren Raid, an  intruiging piece of historical investigation.	1999-11-08

This is the first book by David McCullough that I've read, and let me say I am impressed.  I read this book while I was bedridden with an illness and McCullough's thorough research and excellent prose sucked me right into the  middle of the struggles to complete this wonder of the world.  And I liked  it!	1999-08-11

A good but not exceptional biography of this long neglected cavalry commander, but there is a lack of any real new insight and personal detail about this man.  It seems to have been pushed through the research,  writing, and publishing process too quickly to be of any real use to a  serious researcher.	1999-05-12

This book has the best of both.  A good  read, but to a resaearcher it is rather imperfect since it has no  enumerated footnotes.  Nonetheless, the story moves rapidly and everything  is explained succincly.  I reccommend it to any novice or veteran of Civil  War history or history in general.	1998-10-26
