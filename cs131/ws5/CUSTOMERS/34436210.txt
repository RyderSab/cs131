She acts like she knows so much about basket ball, yet in an interview with Seino from volume 2, she doesn't even know how to play basketball. If I had a conversation with her, I'd tell her she should play basketball, considering I've played basketball for years. <br /> <br /> <br />In the last book, a new character, Kensuke Yura, appears. He's very smart and has played basketball before, yet he hasn't shown up for practice for such a long time. But Kyo convinces him to come back. At Kyo and Yura's first practice together, Kyo finds out that Yura doesn't really have a good relationship with the other players. <br /> <br />Then an accidental encounter leads up to a big misunderstanding involving...Chiharu, the guy who is ticked off everyday about something different. But something happens that totally leaves Kyo in the dust.  <br /> <br />What is it? Read the book and find out ^_^.	2004-12-18

Even if you have not read Akamatsu's work, like me{other than this one}, you'll still become addicted to this series. Trust me, people, you should read this. <br />Description- <br /> <br />In the first chapter: <br />Negi gets a letter saying that if his class doesn't come in last place, then he will be made into an official teacher{that's talking about the test that will determine if you pass onto the next grade or not, and the class has always come in last place}. But unfortunately, lots of other rumors spread around as well ^_^. Then the Baka Rangers, along with Negi, decide to take a trip to Library Island, where a rumored magical book is kept that could help them for the test. <br /> <br />In the second chapter: <br />The Baka Rangers go through many different levels on Library Island, and just when they think they've practically gotten the book, they have to play a game similar to Twister where you have to answer questions. But unfortunately, they get an answer wrong. <br /> <br />In the third chapter: <br />The Baka Rangers spend the time on the \\"paradise of books\\" on a part of Library Island.  <br /> <br />In the fourth chapter: <br />The Baka Rangers, including Negi, make it out of Library Island {chased by a \\"rock man\\", answering questions along the way.}. <br /> <br />You wanna see the results of the test? You'll have to read this!! <br />Highly Recommended.	2004-12-18

Now if you are familiar with CLAMP, you'd know about this series Cardcaptor Sakura, xxxholic, Magic Knight Rayearth, Chobits, etc. Well, when the Cardcaptor Sakura series ended, apparently CLAMP wanted to do something new, and I'm so happy they did.  <br /> <br />One of the main things in this book is going to different dimensions, and when you do, you go into different worlds of series that CLAMP has already created ^-^!!! Isn't that cool? For example, you could travel to a world where there are characters from X.  <br /> <br />Anywho, about Cardcaptor Sakura, Sakura and Syoran {yes, that's them on the cover} may be in this series, but they're not the same people you know from Cardcaptor Sakura. The setting starts out in a kingdom called Clow. Sakura is the princess, the king is Toya, the high priest is Yukito, and Syoran is the leader of an archeological dig. *NOTE*- SOME ELEMENTS THAT ARE IN CARDCAPTOR SAKURA ARE IN THIS BOOK AS WELL. Anyways, when Sakura goes to see Syoran, an extraordinary thing happens!! What is it? No way I'm going to tell you, but it's the thing that will set Syoran on his journey to save Sakura. But he's going to have some company from Fai, a guy who's a magician and ruler of his country and Kurogane, a ninja who loves to fight. They each have a wish, so they have to give up the thing that is most valuable to each of them, and this is where xxxholic comes in. Yuko sends them on their journey. <br /> <br />I'm saying you should read this, and if you don't want to then you're stupid. You won't regret buying this series, trust me. If you're a fan of any of CLAMP's comic series, ecspecially Cardcaptor Sakura, then you should definately buy this, no questions asked.  <br /> <br />Highly Recommended.	2004-12-12

Ken Akamatsu has done other graphic novel series besides Negima, like Love Hina and A.I Love You. Both look like they'd be good graphic novels to read {no, I don't own any of those series}. So I was a little of Ken's work on this one. But after I read it, I realized that I would have been stupid not to get it. There's good characters, a good plot, a good setting...and definately enough girls ^-^!!! If you have read any other Delray manga, then I would highly recommend this book to you. And I'd also recommend it if you've read Love Hina or A.I Love You.      Negi Springfield is a 9 year old wizard. When he graduates from magic school, he is chosen to be a teacher at a boarding school in Japan!! Course, it doesn't help that the school is an all girls school full of sex girls {ecspecially the ones in Negi's class}. So who blames Negi that he doesn't think he can teach his class, since the fact is that the girls in his class thinks he's adorable and don't take him seriously as a teacher. But all that changes when the girl with the lowest amount of brain cells {Asuna Kagurazaka, a girl who doesn't like kids... and it doesn't help that she and Negi got off to a bad start} sees him perform magic to help a girl in his class. After that, however, things start to be looking up for Asuna and Negi. Sexy girls, love potions, and dogdeball mathches to see who gets Negi, geez.       This book is rated OT for older teen, like 16+ but if you're parents are reasonable and think you're mature enough to handle these, then I'd say a person who's entering their teenage year could probely read this.	2004-12-12

Of course you probely would, since you are reading a series done by one of the coolest comic artists alive today. Don't take he work lightly, buy this to make yourself proud. <br />The Lotis Master's name is Frey. He's a foreigner  who claims he loves Alice, but how can that be true when he flirts with every girl he comes in contact with!? I'd say he's the funniest thing in the whole series, and Kyo is definately a close second.  <br />Anywho, Frey turns up all of a sudden and kidnaps Alice, leaving Kyo and Nyozeka. But Kyo follows them and they wind up at Alice's house. There they go inside Alice's mom's inner heart to rid her of her Mara {darkness in her soul that a lotis master could fix if they know the right words}. <br />In the next chapter, a snobby girl named Oishi enters the picture and starts saying mean things to Kyo and Alice. The trio go into her inner heart to rid of a monster and the Mara. And guess who makes an appearence in this book! <br />I'm not telling you anymore than that so you won't buy it, but it is highly recommended.	2004-12-01

The new character that appears in this book is Tai Yi-Jun. She gave the Universe of the Four Gods to Hotohori. She is pretty scary if you're not used to her. <br />In this installment, Miaka, Tamahome, Hotohori, and Nuriko go to see Tai Yi-Jun. At the beginning of the book, Miaka doesn't feel well. Nuriko believes that if she goes back to her hometown, she will feel better. So the foursome go to Daichi Mountain to see Tai, who could help Miaka. However, there is one test needed so Miaka can prove if she really is the Priestess of Suzuku. It involves... Miaka's bad side?! Oh no!! No way I am telling you anymore than that, but I will tell you that Miaka succeeds in going back to her hometown. <br />Highly Recommended.	2004-12-01

It looked interesting, since I'd never read a book by Watase, and the name sounded interesting, so I ordered it. What I discovered was a beginning of something that could turn out to be completely worthwhile. I thought that I didn't waste my money on this, it was so good that I couldn't wait to get the next volume. If VIZ had an anime series of this, I'd be even more thrilled. Like me, if you stumble upon this comic whether it's recommended for you or not, get it. Trust me, it's worth the money.  <br />The two heros of this series are Alice Seno {the main character;a lotis master; she has an older sister named Mayura, who is more popular than her; she keeps everything hidden inside herself and never lets anyone know how she really feels; she's also in love with Kyo Wakamiya} and Kyo Wakamiya { a guy who is popular at his school, which is the same school as Alice and Mayura; he's very dense; also a lotis master}. <br />Now you're probely wondering what a Lotis Master is. I'll just say this right now, it's not very common. There are 24 lotis words, and when you do a self-rightous act kind of thing {for example, Alice saves a bunny in the middle of the road, Alice would master the 19th word of the lotis, rangu, for courage}, you'd master one of the 24 words. <br />The series is about a girl named Alice Seno, who is always outshined by her older sister, Mayura. On her way home from being devestated by Mayura, Alice comes across a bunny that almost got her killed. But the bunny {Nyozeka} can actually transform into a human girl {with freaky mistakes like being able to float and having ears come out of her head}, and what's more, she can talk. Nyozeka is the one who tells Alice about the lotis, and also tells her that she's got to master them. Alice has only mastered Rangu so far. The Lotis Master's words that say, so when they say something that has an effect one the person, it really could happen. So guess whathappens to Mayura when she is told by Alice to disappear. <br />Highly Recommended.	2004-12-01

Some good news to fans- a new celeestial warrior appears, Chichiri. He trained under the watchful eye of Tai-Yi Jun { I can just imagine spending three years with her... that face <br />-_-}. And because of that, he learned some cool moves like how to freeze people {no da! ^-^}. <br /> <br />And a turning-point character shows up- Yui, Miaka's best friend. She has a thing for the celestial warrior Tamahome.  <br /> <br />In the previous book, Yui goes missing, so Miaka goes back through the Universe of the Four Gods so Miaka could find Yui. She goes to the kingdom Qu- Dong, where she believes Yui might be, followed closely by Tamahome. The good news is Miaka finds Yui. At first Yui wants yo go back to Hong Nan with Miaka and Tamahome, but a conversation they have makes her want to reconsider.  <br /> <br />Wanna read the bad news?

One of the resons is because she made this great comic series, Fushigi Yugi, the mysterious play. I'm so happy I decided to try out this series. I've always liked her other creations of Ceres, Celestial Legend, Alice 19th, and Imadoki!. <br /> <br />The main characters that are introduced in this comic is Miaka Yuki {the main character, a 15 year old who's mother is making her study for her high school entrance exam and depriving her of fun, The Priestess of Suzuku}, Tamahome { a gorgoues guy who saves Miaka and her best friend Yui when they first go into Universe of the Four Gods, he expects to be paid whenever he helps someone, a constellation of Suzuku}, Hotohori {the emporer of Hong-Nan, he is one of the seven constellations of Suzuku who cares deeply about Miaka} and Nuriko { a girl who is actually a guy, he has a thing for Hotohori and doesn't like Miaka, another constellation of Suzuku}. <br /> <br />The series is about a girl named Miaka Yuki who has to study every night for her high school entrance exams. One day at the library, Miaka and Yui find a book titled The Universe of the Four Gods, and they actually go into the book. And after not spending that much time in the book {they meet Tamahome who saves them from some whakos}, they somehow comeback to the library. On the second time in Miaka goes alone to escape from her mother. She meets Hotohori {and mistakes him for a woman  <br />^-^}, who tells her she is a girl from a legend who must become the priestess of suzuku to save the empire, Hong-Nan {Suzuku is one of the four gods of China}. And that means Miaka has to the seven constellations of Suzuku. But what happens if the book becomes closed!? <br /> <br />The series takes place in Ancient China, inside the universe of the four gods.  <br />Highly Recommended	2004-11-27

The characters in this book go along greatly with a series of  <br /> <br />this kind of nature, ecspecially the two main characters, Yuko  <br /> <br />Watanuki. Anyone into weird comics should definately check this  <br /> <br />book out, let alone any fan of CLAMP.  <br /> <br />When I first heard about what Clamp had done about crossing the  <br /> <br />comic series Tsubasa and xxxholic, I immediately became  <br /> <br />thrilled. The first series I got out of the two was Tsubasa  <br /> <br />because I had some experience with Cardcaptor Sakura. When I  <br /> <br />read that, I wanted to see what the other side of this  <br /> <br />cross-over was about. So I got xxxholic not to long after I got  <br /> <br />Tsubasa. Both are great and both I recommend to you. <br /> <br />In this installment, Watanuki continues to work for the  <br /> <br />space-time witch Yuko. She sends the Tsubasa characters Syoran, <br /> <br />Sakura, Fai, and Kurogane, each giving up something valuable.  <br /> <br />After that, Yuko takes Watanuki to see a fortune teller.

The other two books I have read in this series, and they are just as good as this one. The whole series is called the children of the red king. It gets it's name because there was a king called the red king, who was a magician. And there are 10 children who are decendants of him who each have different powers and go to Bloor's Academy. Charlie Bone's power is that he can hear photographs and can sometimes \\"travel\\" into them. <br />What happens in this book is Charlie Bone and Emma Tolly {another decendant of the red king} find this invisible boy in the attics of Bloor's Acedamy. But there are many obsticles to saving the invisible boy Ollie Sparks, which include the powerful shapeshifter Yolanda Yewbeam who has taken the shape of the pretty girl Belle Donner, and a magician who wreaks havoc. And unfortunately, Charlie is blamed!! <br />I definately recommend this book to any fan of Harry Potter books and anyone who likes a good book.	2004-11-26

But when I got it, it wasn't all that I expected. But trust me, it gets better.  <br />We are swept into the lives of the two main characters of the series, Yukino Miyazawa and Souichiro Arima, both do great in school and both are admired by their peers. In the previous book, Souichiro confessed his love to Yukino, so in the first part of this book, Yukino tries confessing her love to Souichiro. It's funny and romantic at how so many times she tries, and you'd be suprised how she finally does. In the next chapter, Yukino and Souichiro try and spend some time together with each other, but they can't because they each have some work to do {ecspecially Souicihro}. Another nice chapter that also contains some laughs. In the next chapter, another popular student at Souichiro and Yukino's school is trying to get in the way of their relationship, boy is he funny. The next chapter is a two-way communication chapter about how Souichiro and Yukino feel about each other. A very cute chapter. <br />The bonus manga is also cute. It reveals how Souichiro fell in love with Yukino. <br />This series teaches you some good life lessons. It may not be for everybody, but at least give it a try. It gets better.	2004-11-26

It has it's similarities and differences to the manga. Similarites: It has the same plot same villians, same sailor scouts in order of appearences. But the differences are: The magna is intended for older people. Comparing this to the anime, it seems like that's more for younger kids{ except the original uncut version and special uncut of Sailor Moon}. <BR>This book has a different beginning to the manga, and parts I'd wish they included in it. I think every time I read the manga I'll wish for that, because it's not just this one, it's the other ones to.<BR>In this book, we meet Serena Tsukino{better known as Bunny, Usagi in the japanese version}. She meets a cat named Luna, who later bacomes Bunny's guardian cat. Luna gives Bunny a brooch{ the one that she has on on the front page, which I think looks prettier than the one in the anime}to tranform into the warrior for good, Sailor Moon to battle the evil forces { Bunny's only worring about the Dark Kingdom right now. The other senshi Mercury {Amy Mizuno, Ami in the japanese}, Mars {Raye Hino, Rei in the japanese}, Jupiter {Lita Kino, Makato in the japanese} appear. Sailor Venus {Mina Aino, Minako in the japanese} appears in the next book. So if you want to read a great manga, read this. Not just this manga, but all the other sm mangas,too.	2003-10-25

This series of books{only the chapter books in this series} is different than any other little kids chapter books{ that I know of at least} that have black and white pictures in them. This series has not only black and white pictures, but also some color pictures, too. Not only that, but it also has a postcard on the back. When I watched Digimon before{ I still do, but not as much}, I always thought that before Kari came { or at least close to when she came}, the first season was kinda boring, and this book is definately boring. The second season{ the whole thing} was way better than this, along with the whole third and fourth season. If you're a big fan of Digimon and 8 years and younger, this book may be a good choise.

But I kinda wish I'd waited for the Authentic Manga version to come out. Oh well.<BR>This was the second anime series I started collecting after Sailor Moon, which is pretty similer to this. For starters, it includes important magical items like the Clow Book, Clow Cards, and the two different sealing wands. And for Sailor Moon, her brooches and her rods. And the main character in each series has a guardian: Luna and Kero. And both shows deal with friendship. But there are some differences. There are alot more magical people in Sailor Moon than there are in Cardcaptor Sakura. But Sakura has a WAY bigger varity of costumes than anyone in Sailor Moon!! And there is one very different purpose to each show. In Sailor Moon, the senshi battle evil. And Sakura captures the Clow Cards. And it's obvious that Sailor Moon is the leader of the Sailor Senshi, but Sakura isn't really the leader of anything. She has Kero and Yue, but that's not as big as the group Sailor Moon has. <BR>Without further delay, here is my summary of this book:<BR>In the first chapter:<BR>Sakura captures the Firey Card.<BR>Kero becomes his true form.<BR>In the second chapter:<BR>Sakura captures the Earthy Card.<BR>Yue appears.<BR>Yue tests Sakura to see if she can be the \\"Master of the Clow\\".<BR>In the third chapter:<BR>Sakura's staff changes. <BR>Sakura becomes the master of the clow.	2003-08-30

This is the most romantic book out of the whole saga{1-12}. I usually don't like romantic books, but for this, I'll make an exception. And, besides, I'd be pointless two own the other 11 and not this one. Not only is it romantic, but it's sad. And I think everyone knows why.<BR>It's so cute that Sakura blushes over Yukito, like she used to {only because Syoran tells Sakura that he loves her}.<BR>It's a good thing Meilin isn't in the manga, or she'd be really ticked to find out that Sakura and Syoran are together.	2003-08-19

I think this \\" MASTER OF THE CLOW\\" story arc is alot better than the first CAPTURING CLOW CARDS\\" arc. The reasons are why are because:<BR>1. It's \\"AUTHENTIC MANGA\\" in right to left format and it's more cool since it's the way the people in Japan make/read them.<BR>2. The CLAMP group put little japanese laanguage tidbits in these.<BR>4. I like how the CLAMP group made the front of these, with it kind of looking like CLOW CARD, and Sakura  being the picture in the middle.<BR>5. The events roll by faster.<BR>6.

There is a lot of great stuff about this series:<BR>When it says \\"Based on the hit TV series\\", it means it. Last year when I was on summer vacation, I was watching a first season episode of Sailor Moon that was the first episode in this novel, I thought I was wasting my time watching it. The novel episode of it is so much better. It's more funny and great. And each novel includes 6 things:<BR>#1 action<BR>#2 adventure<BR>#3 romance<BR>#4 comedy<BR>#5 fun<BR>#6 These novels include the japanese episodes.<br />And because of that fact and the fact that these novel episodes of Sailor Moon are so much better then the anime episodes, I own all eight of them!<BR>This is a series that was actually made for young adults.It's not like the Harry potter books, but the stories are great. <BR>And ya know the fact that this book has a total misprint of the cover, and in a add for tokyopop books in the back of the first Sailor Moon comic they showed the first novel and the cover was the same picture that was on the back of the first comic!!<BR>In the first novel episode:<BR>A fake Tuxedo Mask writes love letters to all the eighth grade girls in hopes that he will find Sailor Moon.<BR>In the second novel episode {a japanese episode}:<BR>Serena, Amy, Raye, and Luna go to the beach and soon knows a ghost exists there!!!<BR>In the second novel episode:<BR>A girl working on the Sailor V movie has been possesed and has stopped being friend with her friend!! Will they become friends again?
