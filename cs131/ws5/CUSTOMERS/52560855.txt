Whereas, a good book, is a good book I was overjoyed to see that Ms. McMillan has stood her ground and not just fall into the mainstream of what is selling now.  She has not forsaken the audience that helped her pioneer the new renaissance of African American Literature. This book will do well, and hopefully the publishing industry will realize that the middle-aged African American reader is still alive and kicking; and most importantly purchasing books.    P.

It was a wonderful experience.  The story although aimed toward young teen audiences, is not too simple for adults to enjoy.  This story is a heartfelt introduction to slavery for today's youth (to whom many this history is forgotten.)  Kudos to Mr. Mosley for taking on such a tough subject; and for the foresight to aim it to a young audience. <br /> <br />On another note, Ossie Davis did an outstanding job with the narrative; I will always treasure this as one of his great works of art. <br /> <br />-- P.

I have always enjoyed Ms. Wilson Wesley as a mystery author, and was very excited to see her tackle a new genre.  I was not disappointed!  The novel was good cover to cover, and was tastefully done.  I especially enjoyed  reading a tale about a mature relationship.  I am recommending it to my  book club.	1999-11-15

Most of our members do not like Sci-Fi/Fantasy, so when I suggested this there were a lot of moans.  At our monthly meeting, we discovered that everyone really enjoyed  this book.  It was amazing how much discussion we got from such a little  book.  I am excited to see people of color write in this genre, and I look  forward to Ms. Hopkinson's next book.  It is obvious to me why she has won  so many awards.	1999-07-05
