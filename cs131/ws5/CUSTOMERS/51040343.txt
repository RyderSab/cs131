I didn't even know that 1848 was a significant year until I saw her book at a local bookstore.  Apparently, revolution rocked Europe from France to Hungary, sparing only Britain (although Robertson focuses on a very minor revolt in Ireland) and Russia (where it was way too oppressive to even think of a revolution).  Ms. Robertson presents the period from the idealists who began each revolution and the people who worked tirelessly to repress them.  I really liked the way the presented the major players as human beings, with both good and bad points.  Even the aristocrats who brought down all the revolutions are presented in both good and bad lights.  The book is not too dry, being easy to read throughout.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in European history, or are just curious about the tragedies that were the revolutions of 1848.	2001-03-28
US	51040343	R1XQAGQMZ60NKC	0441680291	232145714	Procurator	Books	5	12	12	N	N	High quality alternate history	This is one of the few Roman alternate histories I've read where Rome survives without being assisted by magic or aliens - and the way Mitchell presents it seems like it could have happened.  Germanicus is a sympathetic character, and the supporting characters are also fleshed out very well.  The changing points -Pilate pardoning Jesus and a victory in the Teutonoberg forest are intriguing.  <br />The story itself is great, so good I immediately rushed out and bought the other two books.  There are only 3 flaws with it.  All the modern technology in the book is never adequately detailed (I assume a sand-galley is a tank but I'm still not totally sure).  ALL of the modern tech is invented by two guys - the emperor Fabius and a Greek named Ptolemaeus - which doesn't seem quite believable to me.  I guess the new technology can only be endorsed by an emperor.  And finally Mitchell says that the Julian line has lasted for 2000 years - meaning that without a German frontier or a messiah in the east that Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero don't kill off all prospective heirs.<br />But these are minor points.  If you are interested in Roman history or are in the mood for a very good alternate history I would heartily recommend it to you.	2001-03-28

For once, all of the major characters are interesting, as well as many of the minor ones.  The battle scenes are done well, as is the historical imagery.  I also thought the magic was done well enough.  And I like the way he didn't explain everything that was going on, that way we'll keep guessing until we get the next book.<br />However there are some things that bring down enjoyment somewhat.  For one thing, Harlan never explains why the Empire has survived, other than perhaps Rome's &quot;curse&quot;.  History up until when Rome should have fallen stays exactly the same except the absence of Christianity, even with the introduction of magic.  I think Caesar would not have been half as docile as presented in the book - although the resurrection may have changed him.  And is he paid by the word - this book is HUGE, when it could have been cut down significantly.  Not that there are large boring parts, but I had the feeling he could have gotten on with it.<br />I stayed away from this book for a long time due to bad reviews, which is unfortunate since it IS good.  Just don't expect the next Lord of the Rings here.  I eagerly await the next one, in paperback.	2001-02-25

I even thought this book was so good I've purchased some other books by Norwich.  He writes with a passion for his subject that is quite evident when reading it, and his enthusiasm is infectious.  A Short History of Byzantium is one of those rare history books that I enjoyed so much that I did not want for it to end, and I actually missed reading it for a while.<br />The flaws are few, and don't really take anything away from enjoying it.  For one, cramming 1000 years in 600 pages means that Norwich cannot dwell too long on any one subject.  So really great leaders get an extra paragraph on how good they were, while bad ones are speeded through.  Actually trying to remember the really good emperors a month later is difficult, since there was SO many of them, but I'll probably re-read it later.<br />All in all, this is one of the best history books I've ever read, and I would recommend it to anyone remotely interested in the subject.	2001-02-23

I was surprised at just how optimistic everyone was:  socialism and anarchism didn't seem like lofty dreams and progress was natural and beneficial.  Problems like poverty, inequality, and war appeared to have solutions just around the corner.<br />Tuchman's method of choosing what to include is both interesting and nearly-annoyingly incomplete.  Sure we find out about Dreyfusard France, musically/militarily dominant Germany, imperialist America, and noble Britain - but what about Russia, Italy, Austria-Hungary, or even Japan?  Other than that, if you are interested in learning about western Europe in the Gilded Age/post-Victorian era this would be a great book to start with.	2001-02-21

That isn't neccessarily a bad thing, the only major flaw with the book in my opinion is when the Europeans/Americans wrangle over the gold standard.  The last section involving how much gold is a dollar or a pound is just plain dull.  However, most of the book a fascinating look at our fascination with the magic metal.  My favorite history books are written by novices, since the author usually enjoys his subject enough to write about it, and Bernstein does have an enthusiasm over his subject that is infectious.  So, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of gold or even modern money.	2001-02-03

Most of the stories range from lame to fascinating, depending on what happens.  My favorite anecdotes were the ones about Sir John de Hawkwood, English condotierre in Renaissance Italy.  The anecdotes that didn't hold too much of an interest to me are the ones from the mid-20th century, especially the ones in Vietnam (they just kinda blend together to me).  I also thought it might have been a bit better if they included a bit more of the post-Cold War mercenaries.  But all in all I would say it's a decent book.	2001-01-29

Each assassination is presented in a (usually) tiny chapter with the life of the victim, the life of the assassin, and the ramifications of the victim's demise.  What I liked best was the lives and motivations of the assassins themselves, since as the previous reviewer said not all of them are crazy.  I generally prefered reading about the pre-20th century assassinations, but that's probably because I enjoy history too much.  Another thing I liked about the book is that you get a brief history of early 20th century Mexico, since nearly all the leaders of the Mexican civil war were assassinating each other.<br />  The only downside to me is that Laucella tends to dwell on certain assassinations much longer than others.  There may be 3 pages on the co-founder of the Guiness Book of World Records but there is 40 on Medgar Evers.  I'm also not sure I liked the &quot;assassination attempts&quot;.  They weren't actually assassinated, why are they here?<br />But on the whole I would recommend this book to anyone interested enough in the grisly history of a darker side of politics.	2001-01-19

Not so.  Krivitsky was a spy who worked for the OGPU, but the little he mentions of his job is just to prove a point.  Partly it is about Krivitsky's experience during the Great Terror, and what happened to friends and associates.  Mostly it is kind of a warning to America that the Soviet Union wasn't the Socialist paradise it seemed.  This book was originally published in 1941, and 2 years before it was serialized in the Saturday Evening Post, so the style of the articles smacks more of &quot;current affairs&quot; than a memoir.  It was meant as more of a wake up call to Americans who thought that the Soviets were always enemies of Hitler (not true when he wrote it), helped the republicans in Spain, and that the Great Terror was just propaganda.  <br />So, if you liked Robert Conquest's The Great Terror or are interested in Stalinist Russia I would recommend this book to you.  If you were like me and are interested in something of a more espionage bent, look elsewhere.	2001-01-19

In nearly every paragraph there's a little kernel of knowledge that caused me to go &quot;Wow!&quot;.  Bishop explains everything from medieval outhouses, the origin of the word &quot;bank&quot;, the origin of European last names, to the average day for a monk.  There is a lot missing (the Byzantine Empire and the Muslim empire are barely mentioned for example) but there is enough to keep a historical novice interested.  I heartily recommend it.	2001-01-19

Afterwards, it just went downhill for me.  True it did pick up with the rise of Solidarity (except that Andrew barely mentions the KGB at all during those parts) but the latter 200 pages or so just weren't all that interesting for me.  I agree with a previous reviewer who said this should be more of a reference work, since it's not that easy to read sequentially.  After &quot;wet affairs&quot; it was an uphill struggle for me to finish it.  Mitrokhin's archive is mentioned every now and then, just to prove a point mostly, the rest of it is all from previous sources.  Andrew likes to quote Oleg Kalugin a lot, which gave some other information but also successfully plugged his other book that Andrew wrote with Kalguin as well.  Without the former KGB's archives, how do we know he's telling the whole truth anyway?  And Andrew has a tendency to throw out 3000 codenames per page, and some overlap, so it's not all that easy to remember who is who.  Finally, the most annoying flaw is that he repeats essentially the same outlined history of KGB operations at least 3 times.  <br />  I'd say it's an okay book, just be prepared for 565 pages (and that's without footnotes) of dryness.	2000-12-11

I did enjoy this book, although all of the essays are of very uneven qualities.  In general all of the essays can be put into two separate categories:  1.  Gee, imagine if this had changed.  These historians give you the details so you can think of an alternate history on your own, and don't really speculate at all.  I came here partly to read what the world's foremost military historians thought about &quot;counterfactuals&quot;, not get subtle hints from them.  The worst ones are probably the first essay and Thomas Fleming's American Revolution essay (which basically is 13 ways we would have lost miserably, but doesn't really say anything beyond &quot;if this hadn't happened we would have lost miserably&quot;).  The second category gives you pages and pages of exposition, then gives you a page or two on what might have happened.  I liked these better, since that was the reason I got the book and all.  The best essays in the book (to me) are every one from Josiah Ober's &quot;Conquest Denied&quot; to Cecilia Holland's &quot;The Death that Saved Europe.&quot;  <br />In general I also enjoyed the essays that took place before the American Revolution, since from the American Revolution afterwards alternate history writers have written just a bit too much.  For example, if I see another &quot;if the Nazis had won&quot; book i'm gonna tear out my hair.  Argh!<br />  I wouldn't say it's a &quot;bad&quot; book at all, even the essays that didn't really deal with alternate history were interesting just from an historical point of view.  Just don't expect all of them to have &quot;The World's Foremost Military Historians Imagine What Might Have Been&quot; because some of them aren't &quot;foremost&quot; and some of them don't &quot;Imagine what might have been.&quot;	2000-12-11

In fact, the leadership likes to assume in times of trouble that the KGB was never disbanded, Yeltsin used their strong-arm tactics just as effectively as any Soviet premier.  <br />  Knight does write an interesting book, but there are some major flaws.  I was reading this book for enjoyment, and found that it is about as dry as the vellum the Constitution was printed on - I fell asleep quite easily while reading it.  That's not to say I didn't think it was good, I just wouldn't read it if I was suffering from insomnia.  The second flaw isn't Knight's fault:  this is an account of the first 4 years of the Russian Federation and the Commonwealth of Independent States through the eyes of the former KGB - what about the time since '95?  Perhaps a post-Yeltsin update is in order.  The third flaw is that Knight's research was primarily Russian newspaper and other media sources - so if you're interested in international espionage for example, the Russian media didn't cover it all except for the Aldritch Ames case.<br />  However it does have its good points, and is a great source for anyone wondering whatever happened to the KGB.  I wouldn't drop everything and get it, but if you can find it it is a good enough read.	2000-11-17

I read all 512 pages in two days (it would usually take about 4 for me) of marathon reading, and it was well worth it.  <br />I would recommend you read at least some of Dumas, though.  I read the Three Musketeers a few years after reading the Phoenix Guards and appreciated it much better after knowing just what Brust was doing.  Even the writing style was similar to each other.  <br />In conclusion, I would heartily recommend this one and 500 Years After to anyone who enjoys adventure or fantasy fiction(with a difference - if you need &quot;a band of adventurers on a quest to defeat the evil wizard&quot; fantasy look elsewhere)	2000-11-13

Yendi takes place in the earlier days of Taltos's life, and speaks of a major Jhereg war that he started.  I liked the &quot;palace intrigue&quot;/behind the scenes power struggles that occurred throughout the book.  I even had to sit down about halfway through just to catch up to what was going on, which i consider a good sign.  <br />There's even an amusing Monty Python reference hidden in there.  Brust's writing style was getting better around this time, there is an improvement in style between this one and Jhereg.  He fixes some of the details of the Taltos universe (for example, there are ways you can never be resurrected without using a soul killing dagger) and gets into character development, telling more about how Vlad's past made him the Boss he is today.  Too bad its Brust's least favorite.  <br />So, if you liked the first one, and don't mind slightly-confusing tales of aristocratic power struggles, then definitely pick this one up.	2000-11-13

Apparently Brust himself was having marital difficulties around the time he wrote this, which he sub-consiously put into the book.  The 2 strengths of these books are(at least to me) the well-rounded, likeable character of Vlad and the way the books is like a fantasy version of the Mafia.  In this one the Mafia idea is not really used, and the characterization is more like something you need to know for later books than actually enjoyable to read.  I read this series years ago, and this is the one that stands out least in my mind - even a friend i lent it to cried out in pain when talking about it.  I only gave it an extra star for Brust, I have all his stuff and think he's (usually) a great writer.  So in conclusion, I warn you, stay away from this dreck for your very sanity!	2000-11-13

Gregory Keyes continues the Age of Unreason with &quot;A Calculus of Angels&quot; and unlike some previous reviewers, I didn't find it too disappointing.  Instead of two simultaneous plots there's three:  Adreinne and Crecy in what's left of France (I never really liked her subplot as much, but this one does improve it with her manus ocultus), Ben Franklin and Sir Isaac in Prague (Prague is the last stronghold of the Habsburgs against the onslaught of Peter the Great, as usual a great subplot where Ben finds love in unlikely places), and the American expedition to Europe (my second favorite subplot, although Red Shoes's dream visions were really confusing at first).  One high point I particularly enjoyed, much like the first one, is meeting some of the famous people of the 18th century:  Peter the Great, Charles XII, even a 6 year old Maria Theresa.  Similar to that is the American Expedition sailing around part of Europe and Africa, studying the aftermath of the comet, which was quite interesting.  The only low point i found is that instead of &quot;alchemy as science&quot; which Newton's Cannon put forward, this one just flat out says its magic.  After a while, Adrienne refers to Crecy as a &quot;sorceress&quot; for example.  But that doesn't retract from the overall enjoyment, and you may find it (like me) to be a real page turner.	2000-11-12

When his best friend joins the Abwehr, he invites Dusko in as well.  Hesitant at first, for he is definitely anti-Nazi (and not even German, he's Yugoslavian) he joins the military intelligence service...then crosses town and joins MI6 at the same time.  The book is a glimpse in the true story of a double agent during the war, and the trials and tribulations he faces.  I think my favorite part is when he goes to see J. Edgar Hoover, to tell him about the approaching attack on Pearl Harbor.  Hoover doesn't trust him and shelves the information.  Popov theorizes that the reason why the sneak attack was so successful was because Hoover buried all incoming information on it.  Another good part is his few meetings with Ian Fleming, especially at a Baccarat table...<br />My only real complaints are that I was wondering just what happened to some of the people afterwards; Von Karsthoff the Abwehr spymaster in Lisbon, some of Popov's British friends, even Popov himself since he mentions that he did quit but not when or why.  But all in all, it is a good quick read for anyone interested in real life spy stories.  It is definitely worth picking up if you can find it.	2000-11-08

Derleth's take on Lovecraft follows a certain theme that doesn't change all that much from story to story:  thin, white, bookish, guy inherits spooky old house by some half-forgotten relative/friend; weird stuff happens that he can't explain; bookish guy inevitably does research in old tomes at Arkham; and the story ends in a paragraph of italics that's supposed to fill you with a sense of horror.  The sense of spookiness that permeated throughout Lovecraft's stories is absent, replaced by an extremely predictable italicized ending.  I have to agree with the reader from San Francisco, the Good gods versus the Bad gods was not a great idea.  Of course it doesn't really matter, since a few gods are merely mentioned in passing when the bookish guy does research at Miskatonic.  Derleth seems to prefer Lovecraft's theme of evil rednecks in the backwoods of Massachusetts rather than promoting anything in the Cthulu mythos.  All in all, stay far far away from this book if you've never read Lovecraft, and if you have read him than you don't really need to be in a hurry to pick this one up.	2000-11-06

Apparently, many parts of the area had never been seen by European eyes, and had been set apart since the Mongols stormed through in the 14th century.  The British spend most of the book panicking at what they percieve the Russians are doing, while the Russians don't really invade the territory until the 1870's.  Most of the book is told through the story of a lone (and usually British) explorer mapping out previously unknown territory, seeing where the enemy (usually Russian) would come to invade.<br />  Although invading Afghanistan wasn't so great an idea in the nineteenth century, much less in 1979.  Reading about both of the routs of the tiny force of British there was very depressing.  And of course the parallels with today are very interesting, it almost seems that The Great Game was the first Cold War, especially since they never actually went to war over India.  <br />The only thing wrong with it to me is that Hopkirk's dryness with the material can sometimes make it a chore to read.  All in all I would definitely say it is a good read for those who love spy stories, British or Russian history, or anyone who believes that those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.	2000-11-01

Some history books are an effort to read, but this one was such a breeze I got myself caught up in it, and finished it in only a day or two.  The first half of the book is by Plumb, which goes over the principal cities and themes of the Renaissance.  The second half is a mix of biographies of prominent figures of the period by different authors - but there isn't much of a difference between these pieces and Plumb's half in style, both are wonderful to read.  This book was so good I've bought a few more in the American Heritage series.  If you want a good survey of the Renaissance in Italy, than this is the perfect book for you.	2000-10-31

But when I actually started reading it I was quite surprised to be totally absorbed in the narrative, even the really dry parts were at least slightly interesting. A survey from the doomed Revolution (where our Founding Fathers are held with complete contempt) to an uneasy (and completely different) Cold War in the early seventies. A really fascinating part of the narrative is how one event 200 years ago can vastly change the history of the entire world...by the time you get to &quot;today&quot; all the names are unrecognizable, as are many parts of the world map. Sobel even puts down an extensive list of &quot;source material&quot; from historical texts that never existed, but don't ignore them though because they sometimes provide interesting foreshadowing for the rest of the chapter/book. I have a feeling that octopus-like companies like the Kramer Associates are going to become a major factor in our own future.  In For Want of a Nail... they provide a third party to the CNA and USM, a nation in all aspects but doesn't own any land.  And oddly enough I actually agreed with many of Dr. Dana's points at the end of the book, which made me like it even more.  One minor point of contention: the British seem to invest the CNA with a LOT of autonomy, nearly too much to be believable at some points. But basically it is worth every penny. Stop reading this and buy it now!	2000-10-29

This book is great, and I would recommend it to anybody willing to try a strange kind of fantasy where magic can really happen, ghosts haunt the living, and Bacchus is still the god of death as well as wine.  But I also suggest you read Last Call first though, since Scott Crane and his friends allude to things that happened in the previous book continuously, which was really confusing to me.

But that doesn't excuse the fact that 9 out of the 10 are for the most part hapless losers, which makes for slow reading.  Most fall within easily seen categories:  those who had really corrupt presidencies because of their con-men &quot;friends&quot;, those who were brought into the white house by big-business interests and not expected to do anything, those who never took on controversial issues &amp; so were liked by everybody(at least at first, their indecision invariably didn't get them re-elected), and finally in a category all his own, Richard Nixon.  I've always enjoyed reading the &quot;worst of&quot; lists, but these guys are almost as bland and uninteresting to read as when they were alive.

The Mossad is presented as an agency that will do anything to save Israel, to the point of assassination and framing their own agents.  I have one major quibble though:  his organization of the case histories/biographies/modern Israeli history was so annoying I wanted to tear my hair out by the end of the book.  For example, a priest at Robert Maxwell's funeral leads to a shadowy meeting in the Vatican which goes to a flashback to Golda Meir meeting Paul VI to a flashback of James Jesus Angleton &amp; Pius XII.  A flashback to a flashback to a flashback?!?!  And he starts the book with the Princess Diana tragedy, hinting more than a little it wasn't just a car crash.  Apparently a Mossad agent was attempting to enlish Henri Paul around the time of her death.  But after she dies, the Mossad is barely mentioned for 30 pages except that they probably know something about it.  I know he's an English journalist and the Diana death makes juicy copy, but why don't we start a book on the history of the Mossad with SOMETHING ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE MOSSAD?!?! So, I give Gideon's Spies 5 stars on content but a half a star on organization.	2000-10-20

I read this a month ago, so all the characters names but Straha have left my memory, so bear with me.   In Worldwar, much of the interest for me was that since a massive global conflict was going on there was a sense of urgency..who will win, man or lizard?  Nuclear bombs upped the stakes, will the world be a nuclear wasteland in order to get rid of lizard domination?  And most of the characters were at least interesting.   Here in Colonization there is an armistice, and so there's 600 pages of...nothing really happening.  Lizards grumble about &quot;oh, how did they advance in technology so fast?&quot; about 5000 times, colonists moan on how the humans haven't been tamed, and all the humans just react to what the lizards are doing for the most part.  The whole &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; subplot was interesting, but doesn't resolve.  And that girl-raised-as-a-lizard character got on my nerves really really fast.  The French woman's subplot was boring.   Like Worldwar, the tale is told by the common man - there is a meeting with President Earl Warren and Molotov is a major character, but for the most part the average joe tells his tale.  This could be a good or bad point depending on your pov. Don't get me wrong, it did have its moments.  I liked the scramble to bring down the French woman's brother, which stretched across the Atlantic.  Straha as always is a great character.  I think I'm in the minority, but I like the Molotov subplot.  The Chinese woman's story was even more interesting than in Worldwar, since Mao and the Communists are still guerilla fighters 20 years later. Basically, I waited until the paperback came out for Second Contact and I'm waiting for the paperback for Down to Earth.  I heartily recommend you to do the same.	2000-10-19
US	51040343	R7TDW4X2WT3JB	0805034544	101388594	The Cold War: A History	Books	4	6	13	N	N	The Cold War is a hot read	A very good outline of 1945-1991 and a couple of years afterwards.  I learned a lot of new things about the conflict (that the Soviets didn't really want to invade Afghanistan, JFK was elected on an anti-Communist hawk platform, Britain since WWII), although I do agree with other reviewers that he left out many things.  Walker spends about 70% of his time on the west and 30% on the Soviets in each decade, so the Evil Empire's motives and actions are a bit murky.  Britain from the mid-sixties to the Thatcher era is dropped.  And he does spend a lot of time on the economic markets of post-war Europe &amp; Japan, that while interesting to me at first, I bought the book for history not economics.  But those are just quibbles.  Overall, the book is a good start for anyone wanting to know about the Cold War.	2000-10-19

It was a wonderful  combination of many genres of science fiction in a mixture inspired by John  Keats and Geoffrey Chaucer.  It turned out to be a masterpiece of science  fiction.  The Fall of Hyperion was disappointing, but did create a  resolution. Endymion is an adventure/action tale set in the same universe.   It does have it's high points (the cyborg assassin was chilling, and the  journey of the main characters was interesting), but don't expect anything  even as remotely fascinating as Hyperion was.  Only read the first book and  skip the rest.	2000-09-08
US	51040343	R1ES4A91207S2Q	0812531612	809791572	Vengeance of Orion	Books	4	0	0	N	N	good adventure...	&quot;Vengeance of Orion&quot; is a pretty good adventurenovel, with interesting interpretations of Troy and Jericho.  My onlyreal complaint is that I was ready to scream if he mentioned that he either &quot;wanted to kill the Golden One&quot; or moaned over his Creator girlfriend one more time.  Other than those minor points, I would highly recommend it.  END	2000-04-03
