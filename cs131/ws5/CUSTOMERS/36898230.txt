In despite of that, I really recommend the website that accompanies this book. The animations are great to understand biological concepts such as PCR, operons, etc.     Everything is in great detail (too much detail for an introductory class in my opinion)... the organization could have been better to make the students understand. Sometimes I feel it provides so many details that the big picture is lost! I think that the cellular respiration chapter organization was confusing (it kept going from glycolisis to kreb's cycle back and forth.) It will be somewhat hard if you want to use this book to learn biology independently.     If you are a highschool student, I would highly recommend this book since it gives a great approximation of the type of books that will be used in university.

Even though the contents and explanations are about the same, the great feature about Serway is that it usually provides more examples than Halliday-Resnick and Tippler. <BR>  I do not think that Serway differs significantly from the books that are used most often in universities. No book will give you an A+ without spending some. My advice is that you should study from different physics books to prepare yourself as best as possible for a test or a quiz. Yet, I cannot dismiss that Serway has done  a great job compiling all the topics and providing excellent examples and illustrations. If you are interested to learn undergrad physics, Serway, Halliday-Resnick and Tippler are the way to go. Choose the book whose cover picture is the one that you like.	2004-05-17

Although the coverage of the book was not as deep as I expected, I believe it is an excellent introductory textbook to the basic principles underlying genetic engineering.<BR>  Even though the pictures and graphs are not as good as in other textbooks and that a CD-Rom with animations is not provided, the plain-English explanation allows students gain a good insight on the techniques used in genetic engineering. The book does not even expect the reader to know anything about science and builds more complex concepts from there. For example, an explanation of different types of bonds is provided.<BR>  I must congratulate the author of this book for covering many of the techniques I used in the laboratory in a nutshell. I must also congratulate you if you get ahold of the book since you will learn from one of the most straighforward books available.	2004-04-27

Obviously, if the verbal standarized test section is difficult for native speakers, it is even worse for international students whose primary languge is not English. <BR>  I find this book to be very user-friendly, it is not a list of words with definitions that a student must memorize as  in Princeton's or Barron's verbal SAT review. Simon's Saga uses those difficult words in everyday context so that the reader slowly incorporates those words to his/her vocabulary and to understand the context in which they can be used. Standarized test do not test if you remember the definition of a word, rather it tests your ability to play with the words. This book, therefore, is suited for that purpose.	2003-12-25

It really works, but it is frustrating because you do not actually know the answer, taking the GRE using the princeton philosophy is like playing the lottery that will probably get you the scores to the university of your dreams.

First of all, although the Laberynth of Solitude is indeed a great book. I consider that Octavio Paz enhanced Los de Abajo. Tell me if I am wrong, but many folkloric characteristics of mexicans are brightly depicted in Los de Abajo. For instance, you may see that macho man behavior in every protagonist of the story; the fact that for many people the mexican revolution was a disoriented fight, and even the bad words that are used... <BR>     I think this is a very good book. However, I do not recommend it to everyone because understanding it, fully, requires a little bit of mexican cultural immersion to know more deeply what they are talking about.
