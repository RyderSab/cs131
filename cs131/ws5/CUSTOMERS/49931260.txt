In reading Henry Miller's surprisingly contemporary 'The Air-Conditioned Nightmare &lt;surprising since it was written 60+ years ago> I experienced the same kind of desire to 'see' America as I did when reading Kerouac's 'On the Road', but for very different reasons.<br /><br />While Kerouac's narrative was that of his experiences with people he encountered along his way while traversing the country, Miller seems most at ease in dozens of miles of empty desert highway, alone with his thoughts.<br /><br />Miller, returning from many years of living abroad, decided to write about his experiences traveling across America, and what his native people were really like; what the country had become, since the ideas and ideals put forth by the founding fathers.<br /><br />His scathing, relentless narrative berates the 'American Dream' and 'Way of Life'...and the pursuit of such. Americans are painted as greedy, self-indulgent, ignorant of history, bereft of morals, and devoid of honor and dignity.<br /><br />But Miller also finds along the way things that he loves. A greater understanding of the workings of an automobile, a love of the land itself that he never had while living in America, and much more.<br /><br />Juxtapositioned with his disdain for American culture and standards, it illustrates how Miller himself learned to separate the people from the place, and love America itself for it's most basic beauty and qualities; while bemoaning those who inhabited its soil.<br /><br />An excellent read by a gifted narrator, The Air-Conditioned Nightmare is not a book for the very patriotic. While it might give such people cause to re-think their love of life here in the states, it also has the potential to offend.<br /><br />Highly recommended, but only to like-minded readers.	2005-06-29

All of the key points are touched upon, such as his barbarian father, King Philip, and how Alexander's dream to conquer Asia first originated with his father. Each piece of actual historical fact that I myself have ever learned about Alexander is at play here. <br /> <br />On the other hand, there are arguments to be made that this Alexander lacks the passion of Mary Renault's hero, or the brutality of Harold Lamb's. The Alexander of Dr. Manfredi exists somewhere in a limbo between these two extremes. Perhaps, this being a book about his formative years, his youth and education, and events that possibly shaped his fierce desire to conquer in and beyond his father's footsteps; there is more to investigate to find the Alexander he became in the remaining two books of the trilogy. <br /> <br />Other strengths of this book are as follows: Alexander, by much historical evidence, is 'rumored' to have been bisexual. This subject is treated well by the author, in the fact that his affairs with both male and female 'paramours' are included, and are examined with care. His involvement with life-long companion and 'love' Hephaestion is given more 'nobility' and 'honour' than his occasional dalliances with servant girl Leptine, but neither seems to indicate a preference over the other.   <br /> <br />The book also sets up its sequel nicely, leaving off with a dream shared with Alexander's name-sake uncle before each embarks on his own respective quest, and the explicit orders of Alexander that his duplicitous and murderous mother, Olympias, is not to be given a position of power in his absence.  <br /> <br />Alexander also sluffs off the recommendationof his 'staff' that he marry and father a son to allow for his possible death in battle and assure succesion of the throne through his bloodline, which he, of course, declines to do.  While I am in no way an expert on this subject, it appears that the author had enough respect for the subject matter to stay as accurate as possible in telling his variation on the story. <br /> <br />I am interested to further examine book two of this trilogy. And while I, of course, make comparisons to Mary Renault, to which I do find this book 'inferior'....it is an entertaining, easy read, and taken in it's own right, a competent study of the life of this valliant, fascinating historical figure. <br /> <br />	2005-06-20
US	49931260	RHODO57E2KPRP	0140168125	146741920	Big Sur	Books	5	24	24	N	N	Big Slur	Kerouac's Big Sur, written after his mega-success with On The Road, could be argued as a very dark, depressing read. On the contrary, I found it very revealing about one of my favorite writers, and his frame of mind at the time. <br /> <br />Given the opportunity to seclude himself from his friends, fame, and drinking to excess in the cabin of a friend, Kerouac sinks into a sort of paranoia and anxiety, and finally gives in to his impulse to return to 'civilization'....and then proceeds to invite a group back to the cabin, leading him to realize that his most recent affair was with a girl he didn't actually love. <br /> <br />The most fascinating aspect of this novel, to me, is not the horrific volume of drinking Kerouac does at this stage of his life, but in the fact that though he was put off by his fame, and being dubbed 'the King of the Beats', and at being hounded by ardent fans who wanted to merely be in his presence...he couldn't stand the isolation.  <br /> <br />Also of interest to me was the 'honesty' he put into his feelings about the actions of his fans...they say 'imitation is the sincerest form of flattery', but Kerouac seemed to think just the opposite...and all but told his fans/readers to 'get a life' in several passages of the book.  Those in his industry, who rely so heavily on fan-support rarely ever are so vocal about their distaste for those same fans, without a severely negative impact on their sales.  <br /> <br />An excellent read, though if you are looking for 'uplifting', spiritually awakening wisdom from the 'king of the beats', look elsewhere. This book is a downward spiral into the darker recesses of Kerouac's alcohol-induced delirium.	2005-06-13
US	49931260	R2MPK2CYKSK7O0	0405078226	595800426	Then and Now (The works of W. Somerset Maugham)	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Now and then	Now and then I try out an author I haven't read in the past. And this was my first foray into W. Somerset Maugham.   <br /> <br />I have to say this thin, well-written novel was a pleasant surprise, even if I am only giving it 3 stars. The story centers on Machiavelli, noted infamous historical figure, and a diplomatic journey to enter into a discourse with Caesar Borgia. <br /> <br />His companion for his journey is young Piero, a (seemingly) innocent admirer of Machiavelli along to learn and observe. Machiavelli is lulled into a sense of comraderie with his young companion, who flatters him along the way. <br /> <br />But Machiavelli bargains for more than he gains when he falls in love with a married woman on his mission, and enlists Piero's aid in realizing his overwhelming passion for this girl. <br /> <br />My only criticisms for the book are that with two such different plot-lines, it's difficult to determine why Maugham took such an apparent departure from his normal genre to write it.  The development of Caesar Borgia is lacking, also, even if what is written is historically accurate...to have such a powerful character in your novel, it seems a waste not to develop them further. <br /> <br />	2005-05-26

And while I had hoped for another similarly twisting, winding, gothic thriller, this was not the case with 'The Italian'. <br /> <br />The opening pages seem to purport the reveal of the tale of the Black Penitents, as the story opens with a group of travelers seeing a shadowy, diabolical figure lurking in the shadows of a church. <br /> <br />But what follows is more of a tale of 'star-crossed lovers', leaning a bit more toward Romeo and Juliette. Vivaldi, the hero of this tale, pursues the affections of the orphaned Ellena Di Rosalba, much to the chagrin of his mother, the Marchesa Vivaldi. She employs the aide of her confessor, Father Schedoni, to separate the young lovers. <br /> <br />Ellena is spirited away to a convent, which Vivaldi breaks her out of, and here the tale becomes at least a bit more complex, as Vivaldi is subsequently imprisoned for his actions; as Ellena is marked for death in her new surroundings; and the Marchesa struggles to keep them forever apart. <br /> <br />In comparison to 'The Monk', which you find in Amazon's list of 'people who read this book also read' listing...this tale is in no way as dark, gothic, or 'thrilling' a read. Though enjoyable, the story doesn't fit the opening pages and the foreshadowing of the 'diabolical figure' seeking refuge in the church to avoid death, the mysterious 'Black Penitents' named...or any of the intrigue with which the book opens.  <br /> <br />Still, in comparison to modern 'thrillers'; this book is paced well, plotted nicely, and comes to a logical conclusion. While I did not find the story I anticipated, it is still worth a read.	2005-05-22

Though 'Big Sur' is reputed to be one of his more 'tame works'...Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn having been banned works for years due to their highly sexual content, the mind of Miller is indeed a wonderous place to explore. <br /> <br />I came across this title while searching online for info about Kerouac's novel 'Big Sur', and decided to indulge in this one as well. And a happy treat awaited me. <br /> <br />Having only recent begun to enjoy 'biography as fiction' works, it takes a rare author to put one at peace with their words, when they are simply a recounting of thier own life and adventures. Miller wrote 'Big Sur' not so much as a 'novel', since there is not a conventional thread to follow, other than the location and himself as protagonist, but more as a memoir of the 15 years spent in this California 'paradise' of artists, bohemians, and eclectic characters. Through describing his tranquil, ambling days spent walking back and forth with supplies from town, meeting the thrice-per-week mail delivery, or simply writing, the reader gets to experience the serenity that Miller enjoyed throughout most of his time there. Being a Virgo I look for structure, order, sense, etc., in most things, especially literature. Little of that is to be found here, really, but Miller's style is so captivating that you can't help but read on.  His serenity at Big Sur easily becomes your own. <br /> <br />But be warned, that serenity is interrupted by the arrival of an oversees acquaintance, Conrad Moricand, who turns Miller's idyllic home upside down during his stay there. Moricand, an ailing, miserable, curmudgeonly man comes to Big Sur upon Miller's request, and had the term 'houseguest from hell' been utilized in the days this novel was written, it's easy to say that Moricand would have received this title. <br /> <br />For anyone thinking of exploring the works of Henry Miller for the first time, perhaps avoiding his more famous works until gaining a bit of insight into something a little more 'platonic' such as this book might be well-advised.  It will pave the way of interest into this fascinating author, and hopefully spark further investigation, as it has with me. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-05-21

But at the same time, he never seems 'graphic' or overindulgent in his descriptiveness. A sense of propriety and discretion carries throughout.   <br /> <br />The only off-putting aspect of this novel to me, which lists many of Isherwoods contemporaries and friends, including Wystan Auden, E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, Aldous Huxley, and more, is that Isherwood in many, many instances refers to himself in the third person, as Christopher, and then immediately switches to first person, 'me'....which is a bit confusing. It reminded me of another book by an 'autobiographical' author, Edmund White (The Married Man) in which White switches from his usual first-person narrative to a third person narrative, leaving me with the impression that he found himself unable to record the events described as anything but an outsider, or observer. I wonder if perhaps the same is true with Isherwood? <br /> <br />Regardless, this book delves deep into his travels, and interactions with his friends and family. Also described are his days with a long-term love and travel companion, and the lengths Isherwood went to for this young man. The book hints at much more to come with the ending words, which is by far my favorite 'line' out of the four Isherwood works I have read...knowing what he is refering to....but I won't give it away. <br /> <br />An excellent read, and entertaining to any fan of this gifted author, to know more about his life and times. <br /> <br />	2005-04-08

Carter Beats The Devil is one of those rare novels you find in modern literature that exceeds expectations right from the beginning.  <br /> <br />To reveal all the secrets revealed in this fine novel would be akin to revealing the sleight of hand employed by a magician, and therefore spoil the illusion. <br /> <br />Bearing that in mind, the novel opens with the participation of President Warren G. Harding in one of Carter's magic shows. Immediately following, the President dies, making Carter one of the chief suspects.  <br /> <br />Gliding back in time, the novel then reveals Carter's initial foray into the world of legerdemain, and propels readers back to a childhood fancy that becomes a lifelong ambition. How often do our childhood ambitions become realized in our adult endeavors?  <br /> <br />The story then follows a chain of events, partially foretold by a medium, that bring Carter to his present position of world-class magician, and famed practicioner of darker arts. Followed by the secret service, Carter employs all his skills to remain one step ahead of them, and uncover the truth behind the death of the President. <br /> <br />A fantastic novel, full of trade secrets and extraordinarilly realized period detail, Carter Beats The Devil is a fascinating read, a revealing look at the art of magic, and a thrilling story.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-03-29

When I was fortunate enough to find several Christopher Isherwood hardcovers in a used book store shelf-clearing sale, I thought that perhaps 'Down There' would be one of the last that I read, due to it being a four-part 'novel' where the stories have the common thread of the protagonist being narrator. I have never been a great fan of what I deem 'short stories'.<br /><br />However, there are far more threads to weave the tales together of this fine example of why Isherwood was one of the most highly regarded authors of his time, and why his works endure to this day.<br /><br />An observation of various stages in his own life, the 'narrator' at times seems an entirely autonomous character from the protagonist, as his wisdom, experience, and reflection are so evident in the way he describes four important chapters in his life.  The youth becomes the adult, the adult becomes the observer, and the observer becomes the chronicler in this caring, thoughtful memoir.<br /><br />Isherwood's four observances begin with 'Mr. Lancaster'...a portrait of an encounter with a gruff, abrasive man who Chris visits, reluctantly..and teaches him that appearances are not all that they might seem.<br /><br />'Ambrose,' the second section, concerns a summer in the Greek Isles as Chris finds freedom to express his hidden desires while basking in the warm sun, and living in the near seclusion of an island setting with little distractions, but plenty of experiences to shape his young adulthood.<br /><br />'Waldemar,' the third novella, follows Christopher's adventures in Germany, as he immerses himself into a foreign culture, and finds that some experiences, some people, some situations are universal, no matter where you roam, and sometimes the masks we wear, daily, are all too similar, no matter what the circumstances.<br /><br />'Paul,' the culmination of the work, follows Christopher's encounters with a seemingly rootless, care-free acquaintance as he floats from experience to experience, and then asks to share in Christopher's Hindu teachings, before enlisting in the service. Christophers finds himself in a more care-taking role at this stage of his life, as he bails Paul out of situation after situation, and learns how to be a true friend, without expectations, without thought of self, and therefore without, many disappointments that can come with those who occasionally let us down in our lives.<br /><br />An excellent read, cover to cover, 'Down There' is as fine a work as any other Isherwood offerings, and certainly one to explore for any fan of his works.to experience, and then asks to share in Christopher's Hindu teachings, before enlisting in the service.

But the story, while shifting focus to the Godson of one of the men arrested, concerns his passion and pursuit of the highly coveted black tulip, a strain of Holland's most popular horticultural export. Cornelius van Baerle, a man of comfortable means, is little concerned with his wealth, or with position; or at all suspicious of the papers left in his care by his Godfather prior to his arrest.  M. van Baerle has but one pursuit, one goal, and one dream...to produce a flawless, rare black tulip. <br /> <br />Thus his downfall, as an avaricious neighbor,Isaac Boxtel, shares this dream, but for entirely different reasons. While Cornelius van Baerle cares not for the riches and fame associated with growing such a flower, Boxtel covets both and plots to eliminate his competition and abscond with the delicate blossom which will net him one hundred thousand florins, more than enough to live like the King himself. <br /> <br />M. van Baerle is, therefore, convicted of treason when Boxtel reveals the existence of the papers of va Baerle's godfather to the authorities, and M. van Baerle finds himself on the wrong side of prison bars.  <br /> <br />However, the appearance of an unexpected love awakens passions in Cornelius to rival those he feels for the black tulip, and ignites a desire in him to share the possible wealth associated with the flower, simply to assure it's development and care.  <br /> <br />Thus, the race is on to plant, grow, and deliver the black tulip to the Horticultural Society. <br /> <br />Dumas' writing skills are in fine form with this shorter novel, sparing none of the humor, grace, and elegance of other works of his I have indulged in. And while foils are left in scabbards, no plots to overthrow a corrupt Cardinal materialize, and revenge is not sought against the bad-guys...this novel is every bit as exciting. <br /> <br />A fine way to experience one of France's most prolific historical authors for the first time, or to further explore his catalogue of works.	2005-03-26

Taking place during the 1950's; one of the major obstacles in the relationship, from the outset, is the racial difference of the two characters. <br /> <br />But Percepied suffers from other self-imposed obstacles, being unable to fully admit his love of Mardou to himself, until she begins to pull away from him. <br /> <br />Barely over 100 pages in length, this novel, while rich in the same Beat-generation characteristics of his other works, shows far less of a 'voyage' for the protagonist than other novels. While you do gain some insight to the life and person of Jack Kerouac, it is limited. <br /> <br />But don't let that discourage you from giving this book a glance. It is easily digestable, and very enjoyable. Kerouac's Benzadrine-laced prose is, as always, a 'trip'...even in a story that doesn't go very far.	2005-03-04

Having first read Pressfield's 'Tides of War', I was impressed with his acumen with writing about classical history. I was in awe at the scope of the novel, haunted by descriptions of the horrors of war in those days, but left a little unsettled by how 'textbook' this 'novel' felt. It seemed as though I were reading a fiction writer's first foray into education material, albeit an excellent foray. <br /> <br />But with the excellent 'Gates of Fire', published prior to 'Tides', Pressfield far surpassed my initial impression of his skills as a chronicler of this story matter. Here the voice of Xeones, squire to a Spartan warrior and lone survivor of the battle of Thermopylae, recounts his early childhood, induction in the Spartan army, and service to his master, Dienekes, through many bloody battles as three hundred Spartans fight to the last man, which is their ultimate undoing. <br /> <br />I experienced a similar result (in terms of reading a second novel prior to reading a first) with author Gregory Maguire. Perhaps reading them out of succession, however, was all for the best, as this novel far exceeded my expectations. <br /> <br />Full of classical lore, fascinating war/action sequences, this true gem of modern chronicling of ancient history serves up a far better dose of humanity for it's characters than does Tides of War. Xeones, in relating his tale, fleshes out those who greatly influenced his life, to the degree that the reader feels the layers of complexity to each character, from start to finish. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, I loved both books, but this one had a lot more 'heart' to it, and therefore captured my attention more acutely. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-03-01

And while I enjoy his style, his use of language, and his descriptive passages, \\"Crowd\\" falls short, for me, of being a classic.<br /><br />Farmer Gabriel Oak falls in love with Bathsheba Everdene, as does one Mr. Boldwood.  She, in turn, becomes enamored of a soldier, Sgt. Troy. He, in turn, loves Fanny Robin, a young servant girl.<br /><br />While the quadrangle of unrequited love for some and tragedy for others sums itself up nicely in the latter half of the book, it was not a compelling enough plot thread to really entertain, unlike Jude the Obscure and The Mayor of Casterbridge. In those novels, themes of love are interwoven in the tale, and help propel the story. In this, love is the story. In comparison with the aforementioned tales, love, unfortunately, isn't enough.<br /><br />I know little of Hardy as a man, and still feel a novice at exploring his catalogue of novels. However, it seemed, to me, that Hardy was the least love-struck of all the players in this work. In past efforts, all the gloom and doom that befalls the dramatis personae is punctuated by a deep and abiding passion, be it for some 'one' or some 'thing'. In this, with too many suitors for Bathsheba and a lack of interest in them or in love in general by her, the tale falls flat. There is little to root for here, as far as hoping that true love prevails for any one person or couple.<br /><br />Hardy's usual grace and eloquence are of course here, but to take the time to read Thomas Hardy and truly enjoy his work, I would recommend staying far from Far From The Maddening Crowd, until you have explored other works first.	2005-02-07

Indulging in a third Christopher Isherwood 'novel', after being left flat by 'The Memorial' was a truly enlightening experience. Much like the 'Boy's Own Story' trilogy of Edmund White, though supposedly not an amalgamation of characters (like White's novels) the story outlines 30 years of tutelege under Swami Prabhavananda, and how the influence of this holy man helped shape Isherwood's life. <br /> <br />Beginning in the first half of the 20th century, Isherwood spent many years in and out of the Hindu Vedanta Center run by the Swami. As he struggled with his faith in juxtaposition with his homosexuality, the author found great comfort in the love of the Swami, which was unwavering, despite his knowledge of Isherwood's lifestyle.  <br /> <br />Along for the ride are many of Isherwood's contemporaries, including author Aldous Huxley, and an occasional weaving in of other celebrities of the time, such as Greta Garbo, and his lover of many years, Don Bachardy. Isherwood, amongst publication of his own novels, aids in translating the Baghad-Vita with the Swami, and publishes Ramakrishna and His Disciples, a study of a 19th century holy man who embraced all religions as worthy of learning, to appreciate the unity of all. <br /> <br />An interesting portrait of Isherwood himself, this book also delves into the day-to-day workings of the Hindu faith, a Vedanta center, and the life of a Swami, albeit in a Western Cultural setting. <br /> <br />A good read, and as much a peaceful pursuit to read as the pursuit of Isherwood's own inner peace. <br /> <br />	2005-01-18

The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay is at once an engaging thrill-ride of a novel. Beginning in the latter 1930's with the arrival in New York City of young Josef Kavalier from Prague at the home of his cousin Samual Klayman, Joe and Sam discover they have a mutual love of illustrating, though Joe exibits far more proficiency with a brush than his cousin. <br /> <br />Sam's connections with the novelty company he works for thrust them into the burgeoning world of comic books with their original creation, a costumed super-hero called 'The Escapist'. <br /> <br />Kavalier and Clay find themselves rocketed to the top of comic book fame, and ride the high life for a while, as Joe longs to free the family he was forced to leave behind in Prague, and Sam longs to free himself from suppressed desires that, at the time, were taboo.  <br /> <br />A fine romance or two, a tragically ended immigration, an unplanned pregnancy, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and a near-death experience in Antarctica all figure into the Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, making for a wonderful read, full of twists and turns, heart-breaking and endearing at the same time, and delivering all the elements of the 'great American novel'. <br /> <br />Other reviewers have criticized Michael Chabon for writing a 'too lengthy' novel (a mere 640 pages!) which mystifies me...a book this engaging and well-written was one of those stories I hoped would never end..his vocabulary is wide-ranging, but also an opportunity to add to your own (i.e., if you don't know the word's meaning,....grab a dictionary) and his style, while grand and epic (such as a comic book is meant to be) is never TOO over the top, nor does it wallow in the picture-perfect Hollywood endings for one and all. The story, no matter how many 'cliffhangers' it delivers, ends justly...and on a bittersweet note... <br /> <br />A truly wonderful book, from start to finish, and a wonderful return, for me, to my childhood love of costumed crime-fighters, feats of daring-do; and truth, justice, and the American way. Thank you Michaeal Chabon, for enabling me to leap tall buildings with a single bound once again.	2004-12-30

Nevertheless, I am going to plow ahead and give a negative review to this book as well...    Earlier in the fall of 2004, I wrote a review of H.N. Turteltaub's 'Over the Wine Dark Sea' which I *enjoyed* but didn't love....I criticized the over-use of the 'peafowl' as humerous interjection....and the repetition of solution to pirate attacks by the dual protagonists, Menedemos and Sostratos.    Here....I have a few more bones to pick...    First off....the horribly, horribly anachronisitic dialogue in this book had me rolling my eyes from about page 7....and while I was of course not alive in the 300 BC era, I doubt phrases like 'you've got a bargain, pal' were commonplace. True, the dialogue is accessible in THIS day and age, but back then? Come on....if you are going to write an historical novel...and fill it with period detail, like the author has...then why such modern coloquialisms? I expected the two main-character cousins to be calling each other 'dude' by the time the story ended, and advertising the emeralds they have for sale on this voyage as bling-bling.    Secondly....while the author made good use of a myriad of facts about the sea trade and time period of Classical Greece...it is delivered in the same 'pedestrian' writing style that I loathe in modern literature...choppy, stinted dialogue, just to throw in a fact or two...that has nothing to do with story-propulsion, pacing, plot, etc...it's just to stick in a 'guess what I know?' piece....and to make a comparison to Mary Renault on the dust-jacket....I dare to say she spun in her grave when that was done. Mary Renault knew how to weave in her vast knowledge of Classical history to the story in such a way as it never appeared 'out of place' to the storyline. The author could take lessons from that ability if he intends to continue on with more than four books in this genre.    I am not a Classical Scholar...I am an average person with a passing interest in Greek history and mythology...and a great love of historical novels dealing with the subject matter. But this...was less than enjoyable...it's much the same as the first novel in the series, where the bickering cousins leave the island of Rhodes for their annual merchant trade season, and along the way encounter the same types of foes, the same married women who appeal to Menedemos, and the same dialogues between the cousins and the crew, and those they encounter along the way. Its basically the same plot as the first book, but with the skull of the mythical gryphon substituted for the peafowl of book one...virtually everything else is the same here...    I finished the book in the hopes that it would improve, and because I really hate to put a book down once I am involved in it....but I hesitate to say that I will investigate novels 3 and 4 in this series....I may as well save my money and just read the first one over and over again....	2004-12-17

Upon opening 'On The Water', I found myself, within the span of four pages, already regretting that I only had 130 left to read.  <br /> <br />A magical tale of youth recalled and revisited, H.M. Van Den Brink's story of a young man captivated by the thought of joining a Dutch rowing team is at once compelling and unforgettable. <br /> <br />Anton, the narrator, a slight, awkward boy in WW2 era Holland, enlists in training to compete with a local team. He meets and befriends David, who is friendly, self-confident, outgoing...seemingly all things that Anton is not capable of being. <br /> <br />But on the water, these two are equal...finding themselves acting, thinking, and reacting as one person, when it comes to the sport they both love. <br /> <br />Under the guidance of a slight eccentric coach, who dreams of sending them to into competition beyond their local endeavors, the boys develop a winning synchonicity in their sport, and in their friendship as well. <br /> <br />Books such as this are rare and wondrous to find, though, typically, all too short. The tale weaves back and forth between the training and a re-visit by Anton several years later to the boathouse and river, long since abandoned, although most of the 'action' takes place in the past, in Anton's recollections. <br /> <br />A gem of a book, thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.	2004-12-14

Not being overly versed in the history of the French Revolution, nor of the time of the black plague, I cannot define what is accurate and what isn't. However, this does not detract from the enjoyment of Pears' novel. <br /> <br />Set in three historical eras, the two aforementioned, and World War 2, the story weaves back and forth between the stories of three men...Manlius Flavius, Olivier De Moyen, and Julien Barneuve, all touched by the love of extraordinary women, and bound together by an ancient manuscript, 'The Dream of Scipio', by Prospero Cicero. <br /> <br />While the manuscript itself is not really a plot point, in my opinion, it is a strong enough thread to tie the three tales together with.  <br /> <br />The depth of love that these men feel, as well as their senses of right and wrong, honor, and duty, compell them to take actions that could/do lead to their downfall, and to great loss. Each is faced with an 'impossible' choice, and must only follow their heart. <br /> <br />Out of this trio of tales, the one that touched me the most was that of Julien Barneuve, set in the WW2 portion of the novel, for various reasons. To list them would give away too much of the ending of the novel, so I will refrain. <br /> <br />Again, there are many complexities to this book which will invariably drive people who want 'quick fix' reading away from it...which is regrettable, as it is a fine read, captivating from start to finish, and a gem of a historical story. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2004-12-14

This is admittedly only the second Isherwood novel I have read...and the first half sets up what I thought was going to be a really good finish...but I was a bit disappointed. <br /> <br />Regarding the various relationships of several members of a family, and a few outsiders, there is really one one thread that comes through as a focal point or 'main' story, and that is of the relationship between the character of 'Eric' and his cousin 'Maurice', as well as the involvement of Maurice and Edward, an older man in the habit of making life more cushy for Maurice, much to Eric's disdain.  <br /> <br />Citing moral corruption and the decline of character of his cousin, Eric strives to barr Edward from continuing his support of Maurice with an appeal to the man's better judgement. <br /> <br />Again, this book has a lot of potential, but it just didn't move me the way The World in the Evening did. I give it four stars for Isherwood's writing style, but cannot give an additional mark for content.	2004-11-22

My favorite two words from this book are ellowen deeowen, which actually took me a bit to decipher to mean L-O-N-D-O-N....due to Rushdie's wonderful economy with wordplay.  <br /> <br />The Satanic Verses is another of those 'someday' books that I have finally read...and thoroughly enjoyed. While it's true that an understanding of Islam would have made this book a far more satirical gem, the humor is not completely lost on one who does not have that foundation. <br /> <br />Two men, Gibreel Farishta and Saladin Chamcha; both survive the explosion and crash of the airline flight 'Bostan'...and each goes through significant changes, both inside and out. <br /> <br />What follows, along with threads of Indian history and lore, are two divergent tales of men affected by the same tragedy. One takes on an angelic persona and appearance, the other is marked with a 'beastly' facade, and treated as such. But appearances can be deceiving...and all that they, and we, know about the nature of good and evil, are put to the test. <br /> <br />While reading this, I couldn't help making a comparison to the uproar when Rushdie released this novel and the current climate in America. Rushdie was branded blasphemous by the Ayatolla Khomeni and a fatwah (an order of death) was placed upon his head for simply 're-inventing' religion and inserting a satire thereof into his fictional tale.   <br /> <br />The comparison that stuck with me while reading this was to those who have spoken out against G.W. Bush about the Iraqi war being branded 'unpatriotic' for such vocal objection, and specifically those in the entertainment industry have had an image 'fatwah' placed upon them (the Dixie Chicks, Whoopi Goldberg) for simply speaking their minds, as did Rushdie when he wrote this tale.  In this case, Rushdie's life was threatened by one seeking to censor his speach...while in the other case, the people's livelihoods were threatened with the same intent. <br /> <br />Regardless of your religiousbeliefs, or strength of conviction in them, this is a wonderful tapestry woven by a master storyteller. While I would not recommend it as a starting point for enjoying Rushdie, it is a story to be savored and enjoyed after a few initial 'tastes' of his capable imagination.	2004-11-16

Since then I have read many others, all with the same extensive cast of characters, side plots, etc..... <br /> <br />Except this one....which makes me question why it is not used as an introduction to the works of Dickens in school curriculums. <br /> <br />Dombey and Son, as a title, refers to the business which provides wealth, title, and position to Mr. Dombey, the aforementioned father. The 'son' refers to a succession of partners in that business, as well as an arrival at the opening of the book, which leads to the demise of Mrs. Dombey. But little Paul Dombey, sharing in his father's first and last names, joins an already present sibling in the world, his sister Florence. <br /> <br />Through the course of the novel, you realize that Dombey and Daughter are really the focus of this story....the fortunes and misfortunes that befall them both, the grievous neglect of one for the other, despite the efforts of the one neglected to reconcile...and a host of others that enter and exit from their lives. <br /> <br />But to recapture and jusitfy my initial point, this book is a marvelous starting point to read Dickens. It is far easier to keep track of the cast of the story, as it is more limited than other Dickens novels, while sharing the same length as most others. The story lines all really do feed into the central plot, and while the 'comedy' that I so enjoy in Dickens's prose is, admittedly, more limited here...it still is a highly enjoyable tale, and a great place to get your feet wet with one of history's best tale-weavers. <br /> <br />Although bittersweet and melancholy in tone, for the majority of the story, Dombey and Son holds up with Dickens's other novels as a true classic. <br /> <br />	2004-11-12

The author, Charles Palliser, obviously is an admirer, student, and devotee of the Victorian time period, as well as the literary offerings, which in the latter 20th century gave way to quick, easy reads and 'plots' that seem merely weak tea in comparison to this frothy brew.    A complex, dense, dark novel from the beginning; The Quincunx tells the story of a young man, whom I will simply call 'John' as he encounters more 'changes of identity' along the way than an actor in a repertory company, who uncovers his heritage, the truth behind his purported claim to a family fortune, and all the dark elements that conspired to keep him from it. Tracing interweaving bloodlines that criss-cross more than the subterranean sewers of London, John meets friends who become foes, foes who become family, and ultimately finds his way 'home'.    To try and dissect this book further would be to undercut the various sub-plots. Suffice to say this is not an 'easy' read, but is, however, a very enjoyable one. The one element I missed in the re-creation of the time-tested 'Dickensian' style was the humor of Charles Dickens, which his novels were, for the most part, rife with. The tone of Quincunx is dark, and remains dark, without the requisite interspersing of satirical English manners and foibles by way of colorful characters appearing in the text.    An enjoyable foray, definitely, into a bygone era, and a bygone style of novel.	2004-10-21

Time and again, the author reminds the reader of the strengths and weaknesses of both, but fails to explore the reasons for the former, nor to deliver any real progression for the characters to overcome the latter.  <br /> <br />While the author has obviously done significant research on the time period, and on the trade business of the classical Greeks, one would think that an author such as H.N. Turteltaub (also Harry Turteldove), with such a catalogue of works already generated would produce something a bit more indepth in making a genre-jump from his usual fare. <br /> <br />I found the business about the 'peafowl' to be far too dragged out overall, though it is the crown jewel of their trade voyage, and found myself rolling my eyes and skimming pages each time they were brought up again...as comic relief they work briefly, but the author relies on the squawking birds to 'entertain'a bit too often. There are also several references to a possible attack of pirates, and considering the solution employed by the cousins,...it's lively the first time, but when used more than once...it's simply repetitious. <br /> <br />For a reader looking for adventure-lite in the lives of the ancient Greeks...this will serve it's purpose...but for those wishing for more enlightenment and exploration into the era the story is set in, I would recommend other authors, such as Mary Renault, and Steven Pressfield. <br /> <br />However, I have also picked up 'The Gryphon's Skull', the next of the author's 'Hellenistic Seafaring Adventures' and have high hopes that perhaps likea fine wine...the tales improve with age.	2004-10-21

My second reading of a Thomas Hardy novel was every bit enjoyable as the first, if not more.  Having a very limited background with this gifted author, it has taken years to appreciate his talents.<br /><br />The Mayor of Casterbridge starts with a very dubious event...concerning a drunken 'sale' of two persons by one Michael Henchard...bidding them a not-so-fond farewell; once Michael sobers up, he realizes his mistake, and searches, in vain, to retrieve his family.<br /><br />Flash forward 19 years, when a weary woman and her now-grown daughter appear near Casterbridge, searching for the woman's first husband, who has now become the mayor, and succeeded in keeping his 21 year pledge to abstain from drink following his grievous error years before.<br /><br />Susan Henchard, now the widow of a missing sailor, comes looking for Michael, and is surprised at what she finds. A sober, well-to-do, respected member of the community, and a leader.  A far cry from the man who bartered her away years before. Also new in town is Donald Farfrae, who, once apprenticed to hay and corn merchant Michael, becomes more than Michael bargained for.<br /><br />To tell any more of the plot would be to deprive a reader of numerous twists and turns that occur along the way to the conclusion of this wonderful novel.  Perhaps its due to a limited amount of experience with Hardy, but I found several jaw-dropping revelations along the way, and more twists than a television reality series.<br /><br />The story is never dull, nor is it mired in too much unnecessary detail or character introduction. Each of the 'dramatis personae' are well-realized, as is the notion that the past can always change the course of the future.<br /><br />For newcomers to Hardy's works, indulge in this page-turner, which is fraught with enjoyment. As this is a less 'dreary' tale than Jude the Obscure, I would recommend it as an introduction to Hardy's style...and a chance to meet a masterful storyteller..	2004-10-04

A man who spent many years traversing the country back and forth, living virtually hand to mouth most of the time...sleeping under the stars, practicing yoga in the woods on a winter's night...there isn't much in his works to not set afire the heart of a drifter. <br /> <br />Though this novel has a lesser 'landscape' than On The Road, Dharma Bums is every bit as much of a journey for the author. At a time when one of his close friends had influenced his interest in Buddhism, Kerouac criss-crosses the country again, home for the holidays, and then back to California.  While home, he wanders to the woods time and again, to center himself with nature and his surroundings, and stays on through the cold months.  <br /> <br />Eventually, the thought of his friends and free-wheeling existence in California draw him back, where he finds some changes to the people he left there, but ever the chameleon, Ray Smith (Kerouac) assimilates himself back into the hive of Beats he holds dear. <br /> <br />Kerouac's writings especially appeal to the 'adventurer boy' I left behind when adulthood called. Though some might call Kerouac's existence rootless and irresponsible...there is something magnetic (to me) about the way he lived, at least how it is detailed in his body of autobiographical literature. And though I know his own personal demons are only partially displayed in his books....I still want to be Jack Kerouac when I grow up. <br /> <br />Dharma Bums is highly recommended as either an introduction or a continuation of reading this exceptional author.	2004-10-04

Slaughterhouse Five is a novel that, like many others, I have heard of for years, and always thought I would get to it 'someday'....someday finally arrived. <br /> <br />Described to me by a co-worker as a quasi-science fiction novel, quasi-war novel...I was almost turned off enough to not read it, as those are my two least favorite genres of literature. <br /> <br />But from open to close, Slaughterhouse is compulsively readable.  <br /> <br />Centering on the life of one Billy Pilgrim, the story floats back and forth through episodes of his life as he has become, per his own description, 'unstuck in time'. Weaving between events from his childhood; time spent in the Vietnam war; his marriage; his career; etc.; Billy provides a glimpse into the horrors of war, and the life-long effect they can have on a person. <br /> <br />The strengths of this novel are that the language is easy to follow, the tale is never preachy in its opposition to war, and the humor of following Billy through his time-travels, and the disbelief of others.   <br /> <br />At the end, one is left to question the validity of Billy's travels, as evidence is presented to support what could be deemed simply an 'escape' into past events of his life to deal with the effects of the war....juxtapositioned with present events, that Billy, lost in his past, describes as the 'future'... <br /> <br />Whatever the 'truth' of the story is, Slaughterhouse Five is entertaining, easily read, and highly enjoyable..... <br /> <br />Hopefully others who plan to read it 'someday' will get there eventually. It's worth the wait.  <br /> <br />	2004-09-15

The characters are vain, ill-tempered gold-diggers and social climbers, and Myshkin's is tasked with remaining 'pure' in the face of such influence on him. <br /> <br />The novel is long, yes, and takes some attention in order to wade through the myriad characters and situations; and a bit of adeptness at 'reading between the lines' in order to recognize the theme that the author was exploring. However, though I do find it lack-lustre in comparison to C&P, it is a worthwhile read and deserves its place in the annals of classic literature.	2004-09-15

Scott Fitzgerald's second novel, The Beautiful and Damned is a tour-de-force of despair....but don't let that stop you from reading it.  <br /> <br />What begins as a sweet and involving love story quickly spirals downward into the depths of alcoholic misery.... <br /> <br />If ever there were two people in need of a good AA meeting, it's Anthony Patch and Gloria Gilbert. Meeting as teens by a mutual friend/cousin, Anthony is immediately taken, as are most boys who cross her path, with the beautiful Gloria. Fervently pursuing her, he becomes despondent when she eventually rebuffs his overtures, as she does with all her suitors. But Anthony perseveres, and discovers the truth, that Gloria is indeed in love with him. They marry, with all the best wishes of their friends and family. <br /> <br />Too tidy, of course, as this is where life takes some very unfortunate turns for the happy couple... <br /> <br />Anthony comes from a background of early 20th century privilege...having been raised by his wealthy Grandfather. Subsisting on a more than generous allotment while in school, Anthony receives one of the best educations that can be afforded to a person. Gloria, groomed and poised, is the perfect debutante....flirty, but never overly so...dignified, but not above an occasional drinking binge, and the object of many a boys' affections. <br /> <br />The ongoing party that envelopes the Patch's and their friends becomes a way of life for Anthony and Gloria, and their all-encompassing love becomes a nightmare of co-dependency and over-indulgence. Relying on Anthony's cache of bonds as income, when they continually overspend on their endless nightlife...neither ever engages in a worthwhile profession. Their love of one another turns bitter, resentful, passive-aggressive, and abusive, as they lavish affection on the bottle more and more. <br /> <br />Three quarters of this book reads like an AA sponsor testimonial for 'how not to live'....and is very engrossing. A hoped-for inheritance that meets with delay after delay; a stint in the service, as America enters World War 1; an affair to forget; and an aborted attempt at a movie career highlight the downhill run of Anthony and Gloria Patch. <br /> <br />An excellent read. Frequently humorous, though covering many dark topics, well-realized in regards to characterization and continuity....The Beautiful and Damned is an excellent portrait in black of what a 'privileged life' can also be like.	2004-07-22

Her characters here are no less haunted than those of Rebecca, which is, thus far, my favorite of her works, but are haunted in a much more tangible sense.<br />John, the protagonist, encounters his 'twin' on a chance meeting in France. Jean, the 'evildoer' of the two, plies him with alcohol, then leaves him to fend for himself in a hotel room, where he awakens and is instantly taken for Jean. Having no money, none of his own clothes, and no means of doing otherwise, John assumes the life of Jean, the Comte De Gue.<br />Arriving at St. Gilles, John; who muses at the beginning of the novel what it would be like to indeed be a man other than himself, is easily duped into assuming this role, more so than those that he fools with his masquerade. John finds himself intrigued by all the relationships he encounters, with Jean's wife, brother, sister, mother, and child, and a household and glass foundry full of employees. Setting out only to learn about them, he quickly insinuates himself into their lives in a way to undo the years of emotional abuse and suffering that Jean has inflicted upon them, as he grows more and more fond of them all.<br />Each of the characters he encounters has their own spectre to bear; Francoise, the pregnant wife of Jean De Gue, carries a child knowing that her first born prefers Jean over her...Paul, the brother, lives in the shadow of all that Jean is and has done; Blanche, the sister of the Comte De Gue, finds solace in God after the death of her lover fifteen years prior. Even Jean's mother has herown cross to bear, as John discovers later in the story.<br />When tragedy strikes the Chateau of St. Gilles, the inevitable occurs, and Jean returns to reclaim his position as head of the house. While this sudden reappearance was anticipated all along, it still seems a bit 'contrived' to have Jean reappear in the manner he does.<br />But Du Maurier is in fine form as she creates a world for John to enter, as Jean.  The family, so disenchanted with him, scarcely pays enough attention to him to notice any differences. The staff caters to him in their usual methods, and carries on in much the same way they always have.  Its as if no one particularly cares for Jean enough to notice anything different about him.<br />But fear not, Du Maurier has plenty of surprises to throw in along the way to keep this an intriguing read.  The mood is apropos of other of her works, dark and foreboding, gloomy and maudlin....as she weaves her tale of assumed identity, and John becomes the scapegoat for the 'crimes' of the Comte De Gue.<br />An entertaining read from start to finish, I recommend any fan to indulge in this Du Maurier gem.	2004-07-12
US	49931260	R2POBTO4YL3Y5N	0140275363	488928067	The Iliad	Books	3	6	25	N	N	Something in excess.....	Admittedly, the Fagles translation of The Iliad is not the version I am reviewing. Mine was a prose translation, by Samuel Butler, of 'The Way of All Flesh' fame.....and the words inscribed in the Temple of Apollo, 'Nothing in Excess' came to mind as I read, as there is something in excess, and not a good something...<br />Having read the Odyssey in prose form, translated by E.V. Rieu, I had high hopes for what is described as the 'greatest war story ever told'....<br />With a more than impressive cast of characters to work with; Achilles, Paris, Hector, Helen of Troy, etc, etc, etc,....this story (and perhaps it is the translation) is really lacking when compared to The Odyssey in story content. Much of the book is used to name soldier after soldier who dies, along with his patronimic lineage...and how he was killed; be it sword, spear, rock, etc.<br />The story that inspires this book, the love of Paris and his affair with Helen, the 'face that launched a thousand ships' is a story ripe with potential...for both a good war story, a good love story, and a fascinating look at Ancient Greek war strategy, and the taking and sacking of a powerful city like Troy. In this incarnation, it doesn't live up to that potential, which was greatly disappointing.<br />The story read, to me, as a Classical equivalent to the United States' Vietnam War Memorial, listing name after name of slain soldiers and M.I.A.'s....so much so that the 'main characters' of the story are grievously overlooked, and it is near impossible to keep track of which side is winning, with name after name hurled at you.<br />The saving grace, for me, of this book is really the last several chapters...where the grief of Achilles for his slain lover, Patroclus, is chronicled. While never blatant in its descriptiveness, the love, admiration, and longing that Achilles held for Patroclus is MORE than evident here, even if Brad Pitt couldn't muster the bravery to play it on screen in his ho-hum turn as Achilles. Also entertaining is the impish interference of the Gods from time to time to favor one side or another...which was also 'scrubbed' from the film version, as it, according to Pitt, would not 'play well' with an audience.<br />I guess after reading the Odyssey, I anticipated a superior story here, and was disappointed with what I found. Though the subject matter is fascinating...and the recent Hollywood bastardization is appallingly NON-authentic, having read the story, I walked away from this book feeling let down.Also entertaining is the impish interference of the Gods from time to time to favor one side or another...which was also 'scrubbed' from the film version, as it, according to Pitt, would not 'play well' with an audience.<br />I guess after reading the Odyssey, I anticipated a superior story here, and was disappointed with what I found.

I wrote this review hastily....and didn't really give the author the credit I was intending...so I have revised it....<br />I normally avoid modern thriller fiction....especially modern 'you can read this during in-flight service from Boston to D.C.' - and for some reason I keep feeling the need to remind myself why by reading modern thriller fiction.....<br />So here we go. Great Premise! That is what earned my three star rating of the book...just the premise. A journalist finds himself enlisted to a team of scientists who attempt to carbon-date the Shroud of Turin, the burial cloth said to be embossed with the image of Christ. One scientist removes dna samples (via fibers left on the shroud)and uses them to clone Christ....or so it would seem.<br />Flash forward years later, where the hot premise is dropped like a hot potato...and the book becomes little more than the average, dime-a-dozen political/war books...and many do it more effectively. The author is to be commended for going back and revising the book since the original publication to include such incidents as September 11th, the War on Terror, and the slaying of journalist Daniel Pearl....but after finishing the book....it seems like his effort is wasted in trying to put a shiny coating on a permanently dulled floor.<br />The characters are perhaps a bit more interesting than your usual Tom Clancy Rogues gallery, but are lost amidst the nuclear bombs, political maneuvering, and usurping of authority that comprise three quarters of this book.<br />Dull, dull, dull...except for those rare moments when Christopher Goodman, the 'clone' of Christ, displays his 'powers'.  Other than that....the story loses grip on what interested me in the first place. Knowing that it is book one of a trilogy (and now knowing from the author himself that it was originally one large text) and knowing that the author has revised the story since initial publication....perhaps those revisions could have included more evidence of Christopher's powers being put to test/use, and a little more focus on what I assume is intended to be the main focus of the story, a clone of Christ??<br />Sorry to say, but (for me) this only served as a good reminder as to why I usually stick to the classics for a good story....with rare exception. The book is well written, I give it that....but I am a sucker for good in-depth characterization and this story just fails to deliver that for me. I have been encouraged to continue on in the trilogy, by the author, and perhaps some day I might. For anyone interested in a timely topic (cloning) and political/military/war intrigue, this will interest you.	2004-06-21

A few years ago someone suggested to me that I would enjoy the gothic writing style of Daphne DuMaurier. That, in itself, was a true statement, and Rebecca remains one of my favorite novels.<br />Recently I chose Jamaica Inn, after carrying around the weighty Atlas Shrugged for two months. At a scant 240 pages, this novel has a lot to accomplish in a short amount of time. <br />The death of Mary Yellan's mother, and a deathbed wish that she go to live with her Aunt Patience brings Mary to the much feared and maligned Jamaica Inn. Upon arrival Mary meets her Uncle Joss Merlyn, the landlord of Jamaica Inn, who lives up to every ugly scrap of reputation he has earned. A drunk; a bully; a spouse-abuser....Joss Merlyn is instantly disagreeable and unlikeable.<br />But Mary finds that Joss is much more than just ugly words. Meryln heads up a band of 'Wreckers' who lure ships to their doom with a false beacon, then murders the passengers and crew, and plunders the ship and sells off the goods. Horrified by this discovery, Mary struggles with her urge to flee Jamaica Inn, and her duty to protect her Aunt. <br />Mary also encounters Jem Merlyn, the n'er do well younger brother of Joss, and Francis Davey, the Vicar of Altarnun, in the near vicinity. Unsure of whether Jem is friend or foe, Mary finds herself drawn to him, and continually seeking out the aide of Vicar Davey.<br />But in the end, Mary's trust seems ill-placed, as the real head of the band of smugglers is revealed, murders and imprisonments occur, and the truth comes to light about the goings-on at Jamaica Inn.<br />Where this novel falls short, even without comparison to Rebecca; is in the brevity of the tale. With a sparse cast of characters; the end is in sight long before you turn the final page.  The gloom of the moors is touched upon, with afternoon walks surrounded by mist and foreign noises...late night escapes from impending danger, and the threat of cut-throat smugglers ever present...but the suspense of all these situations is short lived, as the story moves on....<br />Perhaps a little further fleshing-out of the gloom and doom would have added more enjoyment to the story; at least for me, as I have a great deal of affection for DuMaurier's ability to delivery dark, gothic foreboding and trepidation.<br />Nevertheless, the story moves along at an easy to follow rate, and is enjoyable.  Though I cannot give it a five star rating, I do recommend it to fans of DuMaurier.	2004-04-12

(eight years later)	Atlas Shrugged has sat on my bookshelf for eight years while I picked it up, put it down, picked it up.....etc. <br />Finally, in January of 2004, I decided to read the book which bears the inscription 'To my son, Happy Birthday, 1996'<br />There are so many plot-lines, so many characters, so many situations to encapsulate, but...with so many reviews available, I think I will just stick to a few main likes/dislikes of this book.<br />Likes: First off; the ability of Ms. Rand to give her characters voices that reflected a decidedly UN-popular viewpoint, that of the individual, or the underdog, in regards to business, politics, and romance. Second; the fact that these characters remained true to their beliefs throughout the story. Even when the going got tough, the tough stuck to their guns. Though the story feels a little dated at times, due to limited technology at the time of writing compared with the modern world...the story is compelling as you witness the fortunes and disasters of most of the principal characters. By keeping them 'true', Ms. Rand also kept them interesting and consistent.<br />Dislikes:  The 'good guys' in the story are meant to represent the author's own viewpoints, and it reads a little self-centered to have them be the 'good guys' in the story, and anyone who goes against these beliefs is painted as a villain. In an attempt, perhaps, to air many, many political, social, and economic beliefs and remorses; the author goes out of her way to make the 'white hats' stark white, and the 'black hats' blacker than a starless night.  <br />The story centers on the rise and fall of certain businesses and their owners as the Government seeks to control production and output, and regulate tax breaks and special considerations for those in their favor, under the guise of 'public protection and benevolence'....its easy to see, while reading this book, where Ms. Rand's affiliation lays. <br />The heroine of the tale, while a strong and formidable woman, loses her credibility, at least to me, in certain actions she takes. While supposed to be a 'good guy'...I found some of her actions suspect, and the author seemingly trying to cover that with justification. And though I enjoyed Dagney Taggart as a character...somehow I found myself unable to root for her very often as the victor of any conflict she was engaged in.<br />However...this is an enjoyable story, if you don't mind the length. At 1200 pages, this was quite a time investment for me...and while it was time well spent, with an intersting and capable author, who did have a lot of valuable things to say...its not for the faint of heart to try and lug a book of this weight around for the length of time it takes to read it.<br />Four stars for voice, content, and the ability to keep a 1200 page story interesting and well-paced.	2004-04-12
US	49931260	RFPA0DLES1QOU	0816633703	80678057	The World in the Evening	Books	5	18	21	N	N	Nowhere to Run	For a long while I have had an interest in one day reading the works of Christopher Isherwood. While performing in 'Cabaret', which stems from Isherwood's famed 'Berlin Stories', I learned that the author had several works available, and he became one of my 'someday' reads. <br />Someday finally arrived recently, with a wonderful read in the form of 'The World in the Evening'.  The book explores the life of a troubled man before and during the WWII years.<br />Stephen Monk, raised by a family friend, his 'Aunt' Sarah, runs from his life in California after discovering the infidelity of his second wife, Jane. Finding little to no 'solace' there he prepares to leave, when an accident of sorts leaves him housebound for several weeks. <br />Stephen is then forced to confront his past, and present, and contemplate his future, when he is figuratively and literally left unable to run from them any longer. <br />Examining the events that led to his marriage to his first wife, the novelist Elizabeth Rydal, Stephen relives, through a series of her letters to her friend Mary Scriven, their meeting, falling in love, and Elizabeth's ultimate demise. This unveiling of their life together encompasses much of the rest of the book. <br />But along the way, many surprises await in the form of revelations about Stephen himself. Was his 'accident' really that? What leads people to question the 'validity' of his marriage to Elizabeth? And how long can a person run from the truth before it eventually overtakes them?<br />The novel is peppered with many lively and entertaining characters; Aunt Sarah, the sage, benevolent voice of reason; Gerda, grieving wife of a missing soldier; Bob Wood and Charles Kennedy; a 1950's style gay couple; the two wives of Stephen Monk; and all the folks they meet along the way.<br />Jumping back and forth from past to present, the book is an excellent study of a man faced with finding himself, of the intricacies of making a marriage work, and of attitudes and actions regarding the treatment of homosexuals in the 1950's. <br />An excellent starting point for any newcomer to Isherwood, this novel at once charms and endears.	2004-01-07

Dreamland is a bit of a paradox for me...I liked it and didn't like it...was intrigued, and bored...so many contradictions, I don't know what to think....<br />Dreamland starts in a dark, hypnotic swirl of smoke, promising shadows and magic...and quickly becomes something else...something more...real. Kid Twist, immigrant and self-appointed savoir of children running free in the streets rescues a dwarf disguised as a newsboy and a a young man in danger of having his back broken by the dreadful Gyp the Blood, extortionist and pimp, by brandishing a shovel which he uses to knock Gyp out cold, and then runs, knowing he has incurred the wrath of a dangerous and powerful enemy.<br />His flight takes him into the arms of...Gyp's sister, Esther...a proud seamstress who is torn between duty to her family and a desire to stand up for herself. Her affair with Kid Twist; carried on in the hindquarters of a Tin Elephant hotel, quickly confirms for Esther her burgeoning womanhood, and the fact that it is time for her to start living as such, despite the protests of her father.<br />Add in an American visit by Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, plenty of political intrigue, and numerous glimpses into the world of Coney Island at the turn of the 20th century...this novel is chock full of content. <br />So why only four starts? Because throughout the 500+ pages..I failed to find a centralized plot line, other than the danger of Esther and Kid Twist's affair being discovered by her brother.<br />Kevin Baker delivers a very well realized portrait of blue collar people, circus freaks, and Bowery Bullies, but fails to pull all of them together tightly enough to really wow me. <br />Worth the read to explore the world of Coney Island that will never be again....I hope that future novels of Kevin Baker will have a better realized plot.	2004-01-01

Typically, I avoid the blockbuster, popular, 'everyone has read it' kind of books...but The DaVinci Code sucked me in. I suggested it to a relative to read, and when she was done with it, picked it up myself.....and read it over the past two days...<br />There are numerous reviews here, and the editorials tell a lot too...to give more info would really spoil the story...so I will avoid a detailed recap of the synopsis....however:<br />I liked the concept...it has a real hook to it....the idea that the story of Mary Magdalene, Jesus, the Last Supper and the Holy Grail are not all they seem....fascinating.  Maybe I'm just a heathen, but I love when 'all the we think we know' is put into question, which is why I loved the first Matrix film so much...it challenges your faith...not only in God, but in yourself.<br />I have not read anything prior by Dan Brown, and probably will not seek anything out to suppliment this experience. While the storyline was fascinating, and the book is compulsively readable....chapters that set up the following chapter neatly, or foreshadow events to come...this sort of 'meant to be read on a flight between Boston and Cleveland' literture doesn't really hold my interest for too long, nor draw me in to pick it up. While the Grishams, Crichtons, and Koontz's of the world top the best-seller list...I tend to stray toward more indepth reading...with occasional exception, such as this.<br />However...if you like that kind of fast-paced, doesn't really require too much attention reading...DaVinci Code will not disappoint. As for it's accuracy.....I cannot comment. Is the Catholic Church withholding the truth about the life of Jesus Christ? As a wise old owl once said (about the amount of licks necessary to get to the center of a lollypop)....'The world may never know'.	2003-12-31

In a scant novel, Rushdie has managed to convey a complete disdain for American Pop Culture; a writer-protagonist who lives for the backstory, while suppressing his own; a quasi-paranoia of the Furies of Greek Mythology fame (one of the original 'woman scorned' figures); and so much more.<br />Malik Solanka, professor, husband, father, and creater of the icon figure of 'Little Brain', who shot from off-time BBC kiddie show to cult figure and pop phenomenon in no time, has taken his considerable wealth, his fear of bringing harm to his wife and child (after finding himself standing over them with a knife while they slept), and his restlessness and fled home for New York City. While immersing himself in 21st century over-indulgence, Solanka says goodbye to Little Brain, as he loses creative control over her development.  Drowning his sorrows and fears in alcohol, Solanka fears that he is the elusive 'Concrete Killer' at large in New York, who has murdered three socialite girls. His blackouts becoming more frequent, his actions unaccounted for, Solanka seeks to alienate himself from the world and remain in as much isolation and anonymity as possible. <br />But the fame of being Little Brain's creator follows him and brings him into a dangerous affair with Mila Milo, a fanatical admirer of Brain and Solanka himself.  Bordering on obsession, Mila's interest in Solanka grows, as does his self-doubt, and his certainty that he has brought down an ancient wrath upon himself that will plague him for the rest of his life.<br />Through his friend Jack, Solanka meets and is enamored of a woman beautiful enough to stop traffic, Neela....who comes to him in need of a confidante to reveal that she thinks Jack may have some tie to the Concrete Killer.<br />Solanka is a fascinating protagonist, due to his loss of memories during his drinking binges; his supposed mid-life crisis; his meticulous attention to backstory detail (again, as he buries his own backstory in his subconscious) and his ever-growing 'fury' at the world around him. Though the novel takes some very 'soap opera-esque' twists and turns, in today's world, some of the best-selling authors around are those who create the quick gratification thrillers that offer exactly the same kind of plot twists. But Rushdie does it with style and plausability.<br />Other reviews have stated that this is not a great Rushdie offering, but I disagree with the notion that being so 'Pop American' this is an excellent starting point to give Rushdie a try, as it is so accessible to anyone familiar with American culture. His writing style, wit, and use of irony are top-notch.	2003-12-16

But Dickens extends this probing eye to include many different types of prisons that we either fall into by the fault or actions of others, or by our own actions.<br />Arthur Clennam returns home to London after many years away to find many things changed, and many the same. His mother, a recluse to the home that Arthur grew up in, remains a solitary figure, cast in shadows. Flora Casby Finching, the love of Arthur's youth, who married another and now finds herself alone; re-enters his life, and he finds himself wondering what he ever saw in such a flighty, chatty girl. Arthur also finds Jeremiah Flintwinch and his wife, Affery; in attendance to his mother. Jeremiah, a rough-edged, secretive man is a stark contrast to his meek, timid wife, who is plagued by dreams of augury throughout the story.<br />Also entering Arthur's life are the Dorrit's, the 'first family' of the Marshallsea Prison...Father William, the debtor in question, Amy; the caretaker and martyr of the clan, Fanny; the arrogant, self absorbed elder daughter, and Tip; the lazy, shiftless brother who, when given the chance and opportunity to strike out on his own and find a better life, wanders back to London to re-tie the family apron strings he was to break free from. Amy, employed to Arthur's mother as a seamstress; finds herself ever the voice of reason, the sacrificer, the kind and gentle soul....swimming in a sea of ingrates.<br />With typical Dickens flair; fortunes are reversed, lives are intertwined; secrets are kept, and revealed; and once again the reader realizes that nothing is ever what it seems on the streets of London.  Numerous plot twists throughout the novel propel the story along at a very satisfying pace. Little Dorrit, after an unexpected windfall comes to the family; still finds herself in the same unenviable position in the family. Mr. Dorrit finds himself trapped by his prison background even after he is released, in the manner of trying to 'measure up' to society, and rise above his past. One particular point I found interesting was having Mr. Dorrit, in Book 2, settle his family into a large, virtually empty hotel to live...as if he could not leave the enormity of the prison, and all its rooms and inhabitants, completely behind.<br />The 'prisons' that Dickens visits in the latter half of the story are those of kept secrets; past transgressions; emotional obligation; and so many more that exist in our minds and memories. <br />While I only give the book four stars, it was a wonderful read. The characters are up to their usual flourish and flaw. But at times the plot devices were visible all the way from Marseilles to the Marshallsea, and seem to come from nowhere, really. While they help the story immensely, in terms of direction...they lack in credibility, and seemed a bit soap-operaish in their 'timely arrival'.<br />Nevertheless - I enjoyed immersing myself in Dickens' London once again..and walked away satisfied with the outcome. Even in Dickens' darkest tales, he usually delivers a silver lining.<br />A highly enjoyable read...	2003-12-09

Reflecting upon his time 'far from God', Paphnutius remembers his initial meeting, at age 15, with the beautiful Alexandrian actress Thais. Daring to seek out her door, as many other suitors did, the young Paphnutius flees in fear of rejection by the beautiful courtesan.<br />Years later Paphnutius sets out on a quest to save Thais from her life of 'depravity' by persuading her to join a convent and save her soul by marrying it to God. <br />Paphnutius finds his Alexandrian beauty; still bewitching theater patrons young and old; and entices her to burn all of her possessions and leave the city (and her less than virtuous life) behind. But the men under her spell, as well as the numerous merchants who have enjoyed a generous spending from Thais for years, decide that it is in their best interest for her to remain in their city, and attempt to block her departure.<br />Once they are safely away from Alexandria, with the help of fellow monks and friends; Paphnutius delivers Thais safely to the convent where she is to spend the rest of her days, and he begins a quest of his own, which helps to spread his name and fame far and wide.<br />Throughout the book there are numerous references to the history of Classical Greece, though it is written with a decidedly Christian theme, at a time when men had abandoned the Gods of old for the conventional diety that is worshipped today. <br />I enjoyed this 154 page novel, largely due to the abiltiy of the author to create a tale about a man of dedicated service to God, when France had little faith himself, and his underlying theme that men and women are simply that; nothing more, nothing less. I particularly enjoyed the ending, in the sense that it showed a 'man of God' as having flawed 'human' traits that he cannot overcome.<br />I hope to enjoy other works of Anatole France, and encourage other readers to indulge in this one in particular. Anatole France's prose is engaging, his literary style easily accessable 113 years after the initial publication, and his story-telling capabilities easily rank with more contemporary authors. Definitely worth a visit.	2003-11-10

If you must leave the vampires, for a moment; for now; forever...you have left them in style.<br />Blood Canticle continues to renew my interest in Anne Rice. For years I have followed the vampires' exploits...and for a long period of time was very disappointed in the fact that it all seemed to be familiar territory, time and again.<br />Then along came Blackwood Farm; which took my breath away. Blood Canticle is what I would term an 'extension' of that story. But not only that, it is a continuation of the Mayfair Witch saga; as well as a (purported) finale to the story of Lestat.<br />Quinn Blackwood has most everything he wants; he has been rid of his ghostly shadow, Goblin; his hated mother Patsy has been dealt with; Mona Mayfair has been brought over to the realm of the undead, to prevent her mortal expiration from the ravages of disease left behind by events relayed in Lasher and Taltos; and his new friend Lestat is completely enraptured with him.<br />Mona Mayfair, the headstrong designee of the Mayfair Legacy was prepared for death, which she did, in a manner of speaking, meet. But that mortal death has brought her a new 'life'; that of the vampire, and an eternity to spend with her beloved Quinn.<br />Lestat still seeks redemption for his soul...having met with angels and demons in Memnoch, the Devil he wants 'to be a saint, ...to save save souls by the millions, to do good far and wide, to fight evil'. The 'Brat Prince' of the undead wants to be delivered into salvation, despite his evildoings. And he wants Rowan Mayfair, the beautiful, mysterious, strong-willed doctor who desperately wants Mona to return to her so that she can help her die in peace, not knowing that Mona has been given the gift of the 'Dark Blood'.<br />Once a vampire, Mona realizes that her life will never be the same, and that a whole new existance is open to her. But there is one final door that she must close on her human life...one final question that must be answerd; the fate of Morrigan, the daughter she gave birth to years before, who disappeared with Ashlar, an ancient Taltos, never to be seen again.<br />Lestat, Quinn, and Mona search for Morrigan, and any other surviving Taltos, while Lestat searches for an end to his own quest. And when Rowan returns Lestat's interest, his determination grows all the stronger to help Mona, and Rowan.<br />In this supposed finale to the Vampire series, Anne Rice ties up the loose ends of some of her more recent works, and the Mayfair series. While this book will not give you insight into the further stories of Armand, Louis, Marius, or the other blood drinkers Rice has made famous, fans have been clamoring for a book in Lestat's voice for years. And Rice has delivered.<br />This book, the 12th in her Vampire Chronicles, is a fine addition to Anne Rice's tales of the undead. Read it, savor it...it could be the last one for all eternity. <br />'And love becomes again my reprimand, my goad, my song.'	2003-10-30

Gregory Maguire states in his most recent adult fable; Mirror, Mirror, that the 'light catches our eyes, but shadows offer more'.  Perhaps he should have pulled his story from the shadows, because this one is certainly lacking.<br />Don't get me wrong, I really love this man's writing style, and his prose....his imagination is incredible; his ability to re-tell an age old story and breath fresh life into it is amazing.  Snow White; Renaissance Italy; the Seven Dwarves, and all the lore that goes along with them;...a magic mirror, poisoned apples, and Lucrezia Borgia as the Wicked Queen of this tale? WOW!!!!! <br />So; why is it less than 300 pages long?<br />I loved every word of this book...I loved the concept...I loved the twist on the Snow White tale...I loved the literary liberties Maguire took....it isn't what IS there that I didn't love...it's what ISN'T there....<br />Bianca De Nevada is the consummate Snow White...innocent, beautiful, obedient...Lucrezia Borgia as the 'wicked queen' is perfectly cast....and the supporting characters are equally as likeable...there just isn't enough of them...<br />I don't think it necessary to take up space with a 'synopsis' of the Snow White story...it's been around for years...and I highly recommend further reading on the Borgias...there is a wonderful study of them called 'The Fall of the House of Borgia' by E.R. Chamberlain if you can get your hands on it.<br />But Maguire's re-telling has left a lot to be desired...granted it is his story, not mine, but....with such a wonderful cast to work with, and so much story...this is a feeble offering at best. <br />HOWEVER...if you are a Maguire fan...read this book...his story-telling capabilities are in full bloom...just hope that next time he gives you a little more of what you love.	2003-10-29

Not since Mary Renault's 'Last of the Wine' have I encountered such a complete telling of the life of a man in Ancient Greece. <br />Born to a Spartan General and his beautiful wife; who maintains that her son was truly sired by the God Dionysus, Ariston discovers his true parentage, and his first love, only to lose them to cruel fates.<br />Surviving these loses, Ariston is then sold into slavery, taken to Athens, and given over to a brothel to have his 'favors' sold time and again. Here in his life he develops a deep, loving friendship with Orchomenus; who remains a constant figure in his life for many years to come. Ariston and Orchomenus' friendship is reminiscent of many others that I have read of from the time period; in terms of the depth of the love between two men, and how once their lives were tied together by their great affection for one another, the bond was difficult, if not impossible, to break.<br />Once Ariston is freed from his service to the brothel,and adopted by a wealthy figure in Athens; his life takes a more favorable turn. Ariston; through virture of his unparallelled looks or kindly nature, draws many friends and loves to him. Danaeus; Autolykos; Chryseius; all people who will play important roles in his life.<br />But Ariston; too haunted by the loss of his first love, finds himself unable to return their affections fully. Though he takes Chryseius into his home and bed, his is not free to marry her; under Athenian law, as he is a 'metic', or free citizen, but not of birth, to the city of his residence.  Therefore he builds his life as a businessman, philanthropist, athlete, and student in Athens, all the while hoping for eventual citizenship to fulfill his promise to Chryseius and one day marry her.<br />The book is sweeping in its scope; and epic in it's storytelling capability. The first few chapters virtually turned me away, as the tone and 'repetition' of Ariston losing his first love, Phryne, were tedius to say the least. The discovery of girls in general to him, as well as Phryne herself entering his life, seem contrived, as if they were hastily added to give Ariston a foundation for the 'loner' quality he maintains throughout most of the rest of his life.<br />However, once through these few almost unpalpable chapters, the story unfolds; page after page, without ever slowing. Yerby's pacing is excellent; his character development full and believable; and his painstaking attention to the everyday detail of life in Athens and Sparta in classical times is rich and rewarding to read.  Ariston's own character and character flaws are well played out against the backdrop of the supporting and secondary players to the story. And while the 500 page novel is full of well-developed, interesting persons, Yerby never loses sight of his protagonist, even against such famed historical figures as Sokrates, Sophokles, Alkibiades, etc, etc, etc.....each of these persons influences Ariston, but never overshadows him.<br />For that I give Yerby 5 stars, and label the book as almost perfect. Although a bit difficult to involve myself in it initially, I was greatly rewarded for my tenacity.  Hopefully other readers will agree.  I highly recommend this story along with my other favorites written about the time period; Mary Renault, Homer himself, and newer author Steven Pressfield. Though Yerby leans more toward Renault in overall tone, his style and quality of storytelling are all his own.	2003-10-07

In October 2002 I started reading The Unburied after picking it up, along with The Quincunx, from a local bookstore...deciding to indulge in the thinner, double spaced Unburied before I dived into Quincunx, and get a taste for the author. Like another reviewer here, I read perhaps 150 pages before I put the book down. It didn't seem to be going anywhere...and was dryer than the bones of a corpse uncovered in the second half of the book.<br />In September 2003, I picked the book up again, and gave it another chance...and read it in four days. <br />There are far too many plot twists to reveal in fully reviewing this book...plot twists that unfold like a stone wrapped in a blanket; the soft, fuzzy layer that we put over events too painful to deal with peeled away to reveal the coarse, jagged stone of truth underneath. <br />The storyline: Edward Courtine arrives in a small Victorian town at the behest of his boyhood school chum, Austin Fickling, after more than twenty years of separation. Courtine arrives with dual purposes; that of reviving his friendship with Austin and finally laying to rest a two-decade old embroilment between them involving Edward's young wife....but not what you would think; and to search the library of the Cathedral that Austin teaches at for an ancient manuscript which might shed new light, and possibly disavow previously documented stories of Alfred the Great, Courtine's favored historical figure.<br />Austin extends this invitation for unscrupulous reasons; hinted at by his late-night meanderings through the darkened streets and back alleys surrounding the Cathedral and nearby houses in the Upper and Lower 'Close' as they are called.<br />Courtine is drawn to an old inscription, purportedly shedding light on another mystery of the town; that of the rivalry, fight, death, and disappearance of two figures from the town's history involved in the restoration of the Cathedral long ago.<br />Further enhancing the cloak of gloom and doom already loured over the town is another murder, that of one Mr. Stonex, who resides in the house next to the stone bearing the inscription that Courtine reads....only minutes after Courtine and Fickling finish having tea with the man, a notorious recluse who only opens his doors three times per day, to allow the entrance and exit of his housekeeper, and to take his evening meal.<br />All of these plotlines are woven together in a 400 page treat which invites comparisons to Umberto Eco and other scholarly authors. Charles Palliser manages to tell a breathtaking tale of murder and duplicity; of grief and despair; of horrors of the body and the mind; and not once was it all too graphic, or at all undigestible.<br />Charles Palliser has created a dark, gloomy Victorian mystery with The Unburied....well worth the time to read...even if it takes other readers longer than the four days it took me.	2003-09-23
US	49931260	R2K552BI1SJ8K5	0679781447	187052723	The Married Man: A Novel	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Les choses que nous faisons pour l'amour	Edmund White's 'The Married Man' is the first work I have read by this author written in the third person, which was a far cry from the three prior novels I devoured last year, his autobiographical 'Boy's Own Story' trilogy.<br />In picking up this book, I entered it with a sneaking suspicion that the two main characters; Austin and Julien, were variations on White himself, and his lover Hubert Sorin. Austin is an author, like White himself. Sorin was an architect, just as Julien is when Austin meets him. Sorin passed away in 1994 of AIDS complications, the novel is set in that same time period...etc, etc, etc,....there are too many parallels to White's own story for it not to be a continuation of where he left off with 'The Farewell Symphony'.  And so, the choice to tell the story as an 'observer' or 'outsider' by writing it in the third person is a matter of curiosity to me...as if White himself could not 'make the story real' by putting himself into it as narrator...like the story as a whole is still too painful for him to tell as his own.<br />About 100 pages into this novel, I emailed a new acquaintance with some thoughts that the protagonist and his lover were both 'unlikable' characters to me...Austin came across as extremely co-dependent; Julien as selfish, emotionally protracted, and abusive. Through the circumstances of the story, it is hard to not feel a degree of sympathy for both the characters eventually, but initially it was hard (for me) to become engaged with either one of them.<br />As in the other novels I have read by the same author, White has a 'baring of the soul' approach to character development unlike most authors I have read. They are self-effacing; emotionally raw; virtually unable to hide any unattractive facet or character flaw from their chronicler...White lays out most all his characters like 'open wounds' and invites readers to gape at them. <br />The story itself, that of an HIV positive man who meets and falls in love with an initially married man, who then finds himself succumbing to full-blown AIDS...is full of the same emotions I have found in other works by White. While I experienced a feeling of malaise with the co-dependency of Austin, and the abrasiveness of Julien, White labels Austin as co-dependent by the end of the story; and Julien's story becomes so heart-wrenching that it is near impossible to not try to understand the anguish invoking his treatment of those around him, especially Austin...as if his relationship with Austin was the most honest, because he displayed his real feelings to him, and didn't sugar coat them like he did with others...who in retrospect called him 'always cheerful and good-natured'...<br />While I enjoyed this novel overall, I have to give it only 4 stars in rating it, due to the fact that I think White's writing is a lot less 'detached' when it is written in first person. I would have to explore another third person novel to really make an informed conclusion, but...in comparing Married Man to the other three I have read...they come across as if White was far more 'involved' in them by inserting himself as narrator.<br />However, this is a good read by a wonderful author, and I recommend it highly.	2003-09-18
US	49931260	R2UJ4JNHYB1A3I	0385040105	458162565	Alexander of MacEdon	Books	3	2	2	N	N	His big fat Greek biography	Harold Lamb's Alexander of Macedon sheds much light on the journey of the man, but little on the man himself....<br />In comparison to Mary Renault's biography; The Nature of Alexander; which I have also read,....I don't necessary find 'fault' per se, as I don't feel that this book offered much insight into Alexander himself. While Renault romanticized the man; postulating on his actions stemming from decisions made with his heart;.Lamb's treatise on the same subject matter seems devoid of almost all human feeling whatsoever, and seems to paint Alexander as more of a \\"brat king' and 'barbarian'; forging ahead by knee-jerk reactions to conquer all of the Hellenistic world, instead of leading with his heart or with a higher purpose in mind.<br />The most lasting impression I think that I get from this book is that it is a \\"man's man\\" version of Alexander's life...his same-sex affairs are downplayed to the point of non-existence (typical of the time the book was written in) an explanation of his love of Hephaistion and their friendship is negligible, to say the least, considering his grief upon Hephaistion's death; his choice of Roxanne as his wife is woefully underdeveloped, knowing the reaction it provoked from the Macedonians...all of these key elements of his life are just...missing.<br />What the book has in abundance is bloody battles, suicide, rape, murder, treachery....with little human feeling.<br />Relying almost solely on writings from the time, and historical fact, Lamb blazes that trail of the voyage of Alexander following the murder of his father, Phillip of Macedon. And for that I give him high marks. But while the 'story' offers *some* insight into Alexander's early life, it is unfortunately very little.  Following the outset of his quest, the glimpse into Alexander's extraordinary and all-too-brief life becomes merely a chronological description of his travels. <br />There is much to be learned about this man, who at such a young age had so much responsibility thrust upon him. His loves, his losses, his likes and dislikes;...none of this is really explored in a book which bears his name as the title.  Alexander seemingly strove to unite the peoples of the Greek lands; but in reality alienated his own, at least according to Lamb. But Lamb does not offer enough insight into Alexander himself to deliver an explanation to the reader.<br />While I enjoyed the book for the overall insight it gave to the journey itself, it feel flat, for me, in offering any new understanding of Alexander.	2003-09-09

The meaning behind the name of this book struck me about a quarter of the way through. Sometimes I forget titles while I read and just enjoy the contents. But this had so much significance to what the book was actually about, it stayed with me. Imagine; even if only 'imagined', the ability to swim to an island within your sight, and arrive in the prior day. Not too shabby, compared with most titles I see, and the meanings behind them.<BR> <BR>But a clever title is not all to be found with this Umberto Eco novel. Theology; existentialism; lost language; and even one of my favorite words (discovered first while performing in 'The Pirates of Penzance); escutcheon. <br />Others criticize Eco on his meandering thoughts and ideas; on his half-truths/half-fictions; his playful use of alternate reality; and his obvious disregard for probability. I say 'what the heck are you reading Eco for, then?' <br />It took me four years of owning this book to read it. Prior to this, I could not do it. But now, with Name of the Rose and Baudolino under my belt, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, devouring it from cover to cover, and opening my mind to all that Eco has to offer... <br />Roberto, the 'hero' of the story, finds himself stranded on board the Daphne, a boat anchored just offshore an unreachable island. Without wind, without crew, and without a know-how of swimming, Roberto explores his new 'prison', having survived a shipwreck of the vessel Amaryllis. <br />Finding that he is indeed NOT alone on the boat, Roberto prepares to flush out the intruder and face him down. But what Roberto discovers is not quite what he set out to find. <BR>The novel flows back and forth in time, as well as in and out of 'reality' as Roberto weaves a tale of his childhood and the invention of his dark twin Ferrante, who dogs him throughout his life, to the discovery of his lady-love, Lilia; to his induction as a spy for Cardinal Richelieu; to his arrival on the Daphne, and the education he receives there in mapping the latitudes and longitudes of the planet. <br />Like the other 2 Eco novels I have read, there is so much to be gleaned from the pages of this book...whether you enjoy the mingling of fact and fiction or not, for an avid reader like myself, willing to open my mind to flights of fancy...the challenge to your thought processes cannot be beat. <br />A wonderful read....and worth the wait to be able to accomplish it.	2003-08-21

It troubles me to give criticisms to a book I enjoyed so well, but I feel compelled to speak my mind about Tides of War.<br />Unlike other reviewers I have not read Gates of Fire first, so I have no other Pressfield to compare this to...and overall find it to be a very, very well written book, despite the criticisms I have to offer.<br />Steven Pressfield has chronicled the major skirmishes of the Peloponnesian War. And with a 27+ year war there is a lot to tell. Soldiers didn't drop into an area, fight, then go home because it ended 2 days later...like in the 21st century. In ancient Greece, the soldiers enlisted, fought, retired from service, then enlisted again, and fought for many more years. <br />They went for months without pay, days without food or water, and yet for the sake of the battle, and the cause, they endured. Some, because there simply was no other way to earn a living. To them, the promise of an 'eventual' bag of pay was better than nothing at all.<br />The atrocities committed to soldiers at this time are also engrossing, as it is hard in the 21st century to imagine the things they were made to suffer at that time. Cast into pits with rotting corpses; being literally branded as slaves if you surrendered;  the list is endless of torments that soldiers lived through, or died as a result of.<br />For his attention to detail with the battles, with the armament used, with the places, and cast of characters, I give Steven Pressfield an A+......but the following criticisms also apply to my overall feeling of the book:<br />Criticism #1 that I have with the book, while beautifully written, is that it reads far more like a textbook than a novel. Structure and format follow a logical chronology, but each battle scene, while descriptive and engrossing, has more of a scholarly than literay feel to it. Pressfield seems to have captured the technical aspects of this lengthy, bloody war, but has skimped on the passions, emotions, and savagery that carried the Greeks to and through wars.<br />Criticism #2; The cover of this book reads 'A Novel of Alcibiades and the Peloponnesian War'...and for me was reminiscent of the book 'Daughter of Troy' by Sarah Franklin...this story is ultimately about Polemides, also known as Pommo, and the journey his life takes as he enters and exits the war itself. I found very little insight into the life of Alcibiades...although the description of the war was relatively indepth and satisfactory. The story itself turns on Polemides having occasional interaction with Alcibiades, as the latter weaves in and out of public favor during the way...but ultimately it is Polemides' tale that is told, not Alcibiades'.<br />There are two other Steven Pressfield novels written about Ancient Greece for me to indulge in, and I intend to do just that. However, I do hope that in the other novels, Mr. Pressfield has paid more homage to the keen minds of the Greeks, and the whys and wherefores of their actions, not just the actions themselves.	2003-08-10

Matthew Lewis's 'The Monk' deserves every scrap of reputation it has ever received; good, bad, or indifferent. Sadly it is the only novel by a brilliant, daring author.<br />Ambrosio, bearer of the title moniker, has lived a life of seclusion and service among a monastic order, which he never ventures from. His 'uncorrupted' status makes him highly sought after for his counsel, wisdom, and spiritual guidance. He is loved by all.<br />But one loves him in a very different way. Rosario, a novice of the order, reveals 'his' undying affection for Ambrosio, and begs him to love in return, by revealing himself as not Rosario, but Matilda, who disguises her sex as she has long disguised her heart, just to be near him. Ambrosio abandons his vows and embraces Matilda's affections, which marks his entrance into a life of corruption to come.<br />In a nearby convent lies the sickly Agnes, who finds herself seeking solitude after being impregnated and 'abandoned' by her lover, Don Raymond. Agnes' brother, Lorenzo, seeks to liberate her from the convent, when it seems that her stay there is anything but voluntary. <br />These two stories colide in the convent of the Capuchins. Toss in an evil Prioress, a ghostly 'Bleeding Nun', a 'Wandering Jew' and Lucifer, and you get one heck of a page turner.<br />Matthew Lewis abandons eighteenth century convention and propriety, and takes readers down a dark passageway of evil spirits, daemonic bartering, betrayal, deception, and lust. <br />But why stop there? <br />The last 30 pages of this novel will keep you riveted. In lieu of unveiling the many, many revelations offered in these pages, I challenge those interested to discover them for themselves, and read them WITHOUT dropping their jaws in astonishment.<br />Matthew Lewis was a truly imaginative author with a flair for the dramatic, who focused primarily on writing plays. He wrote The Monk at the age of 19, bored with his work at the time, in just 10 weeks. Astonishing, consideringthe manual process that an author labored through in those days.<br />A WONDERFUL read, from start to finished, interspersed with lyrical and narrative poetry to propel an already compelling story along. The Monk is a triumph in gothic literature, and a highly satisfactory entry point into the genre.<br />Bravo, Matthew Lewis, I only wish you had been bored more often.	2003-07-01

I re-read this play recently after being asked to submit a few choices to direct at a local theater, and fell in love with the humor of Aristophanes all over again.<br />His comedies are virtually unparalelled in the surviving classical works. The humor of the plays, particularly the Frogs, is just as fresh and vibrant today as it was thousands of years ago.<br />Dionysus, Greek God of theater, has grown despondant that upon the death of Euripides there are no great poets left on Earth. He resolves to travel to Hades and beg Pluto to allow him to resurrect Euripedes so that he might continue his work.<br />Dionysus, accompanied by his faithful porter Xanthias, travels first to the house of Heracles, dressed as the Greek hero, to ask his advice...as well as directions. Heracles suggests conventional methods (death by ones own hands) before he reveals the path he himself followed.<br />The two then set out to rescue Euripides. Xanthias, being a slave, is given a foot route to follow, while Dionysus enjoys a boat ride courtesy of Charon, the ferryman of the dead. Upon arrival at Pluto's house, and after a case of mistaken/disguised identity ends up in a draw, Dionysus finally meets up with Euripides.<br />However, Aeschylus isn't about to give up without a fight...Pluto has arranged for a contest between the two famed poets to determine the better of them...as Aeschylus decries Euripides as merely a 'flavor of the month' among the people of Hades. A dialogue ensues between he and Euripides, with Dionysus left to judge the merits of each.<br />Full of delightful comic insight into the works of both poets, The Frogs is a completely accessible foray into classical theater that you don't need to be a scholar to understand. While a basis of Euripides and Aeschylus helps to augment enjoyment of the work, it stands apart on its own.<br />An enchanting, intriguing, and entertaining read.	2003-06-10

The revelation of a character's involvement in the murder at the end is anti-climactic, as the character was never really given much importance in the story. <br />The author's note at the end attempts to justify the contents with claims that there is historical evidence to support most of the action, and the speculations made are at least partly grounded in fact. That part I can accept...but while the story centers on a murder...the greatest crime of the novel is the novel itself. It suffers greatly from lack of actual time spent researching the time period, and only the few facts and suppositions gleaned by the author prior to writing it that appear in the novel in no way qualify it as good historical fiction.<br />Nice try, Anna Apostolou, but many have done it better.	2003-06-08
US	49931260	R1M1OVSEY1M8PW	0140440852	801058727	The Voyage of Argo: The Argonautica (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	9	9	N	N	A Sea of Troubles....	The Voyage of Argo is the second E.V. Rieu translation from epic poem to prose work of Ancient Greek literature that I have indulged in.  The story laid out here is the quest for and return from obtaining the Golden Fleece by Jason and the 'Argonauts' as his traveling companions come to be known.<br />Each of the four 'books' of this crafting of Apollonius's tale relates the various trials, dangers, deceptions, victories, and defeats of the crew of the Argo. <br />Book one, 'Preparation and Departure' was, for me, the hardest to digest. The first several pages, following a lengthy introduction, read merely like a passenger manifest. Many are named, some easily recognizable from other tales of Ancient Greece.  The crew sails off on their quest, led by Jason, son of Aeson, with Heracles (Hercules) as part of their company. By the end of book one, the disappearence of one of the crew, Hylas, sends Heracles off on a quest of his own, to find Hylas' abductors and punish them.<br />Book two, 'Onward to Colchis', finds the crew of the Argo in battle with the Bebryces, drawing the attention of Athene, who allows the ship to pass safely through the treacherous Clashing Rocks, and the loss of other crew members along the way. Jason and company find their way to Colchis and land there, with the divine influence of the Gods.<br />Book three, 'Jason and Medea', centers on the famed love story of the two title characters. Medea, struck by an arrow from Eros, falls in love with Jason, and becomes his greatest ally, as she is the daughter of King Aeetes, the man who knows the location of the Golden Fleece Jason and his crew seek. Aeetes, finding the company of the Argo to be brash and treacherous, proposes a test of their fortitude, and should they survive the flaming bulls and sharp toothed serpent, and obtain the fleece, they will have proven themselves worthy. Medea, desperate to help her beloved, contrives a plot of her own to aid Jason, and win his heart.<br />Book four, 'Homeward Bound' tells of the dangers Jason and crew once again face on the open seas as they journey home. Medea in tow, Jason must choose between his love for her and the lives of his crew as Aeetes sets out to destroy them and bring Medea back home to him. <br />A thrilling tale of bravery and cunning, The Voyage of Argo ranks with the Odyssey in terms of excitement and content. While reading this, and the notes that accompany the text naming this surviving version of the tale as a possibly 'revised second edition' of the actual story, I am left to wonder if perhaps the 'divine influence' of Athene and Here (Hera), and even Zeus himself, are not offered as simple explanation for events that seemed miraculous to the author. The story flows along easily and while it does not suffer from the 'interference' of the Gods, it is not exactly amplified by it either.<br />Whatever the case, The Voyage of Argo is a thrilling read. It is easy to see why it has spawned many fictional accounts, as it is an adventure tale ripe for the picking, and needs very little 'inventiveness' to augment it to a full-fledged fictional thriller.	2003-06-05

While the story focuses on the many re-inventions of the protagonist, Pran, the book itself as a whole is reinvented time and again. I was reminded of many authors as I read this book, not because of a change of writing style, but of the 'genre' changes the story took.<br />First was John Irving, as the story centered on Pran's ousting from his life of privilege as he is discovered to be a 'half-breed' product of his mother's illicit behavior, and not the true heir of the master of the house. As has been evidenced in Irving novels I have read...the conflict arises from death and loss. After being banished from the house, Pran is summarily taken in at a brothel, then sold into another house where he serves much the same function. He becomes embroiled in a plot to frame a noted military figure who has a penchant for young males, with humorous results.<br />Then along came Sarah Smith, as Pran escapes his sexual servitude and reinvents himself as Pretty Bobby, desperately trying to escape his past and live under an assumed identity. Bobby insinuates himself into the lives of the Macfarlanes and fit into a society he left behind long ago, but with highly differing results.<br />Next up was Thomas Hardy, as Bobby morphs into Jonathan Bridgeman, an identity assumed from a drunken schoolboy about to inherit his father's estate and attend school in London. Jonathan falls for Astarte Chapel, and does everything possible to insinuate himself into her life and win her heart. But, in true Hardy-esque fashion, great love ends up great despair. Astarte vacillates and toys with Jonathan's heart time and again, only to break it in the end.<br />And finally, Rudyard Kipling, as Bridgeman accompanies his true love's father on an expedition to Africa to conduct a study and census of the Fotse, a previously uncharted and unrecorded tribe of African natives. Bridgeman and company find themselves surrounded by an untrusting people, jaded by prior interference of white men, as they came to take the Fotse people as porters and slaves.<br />The book is extremely well written, and highly original and entertaining for a first novel. The only fault that I find with it is in the ending, which seems a little abrupt. One would expect that after so many transformations, Pran might have reached some epiphany about the need to be yourself, or at least have begun a quest to find the real man inside him....but perhaps I, too, am jaded by the usual Hollywood endings served up in films and much popular fiction. Either way, the book ended on a flat note for such an ambitious debut from a promising writer. <br />However, don't let that deter you from reading this fine piece of fiction. Hopefully Hari Kunzru is not a one trick pony, and there are many more stories to come from this impressive new talent.	2003-05-30

Now, having read The Name of the Rose...I do.<br />I plan someday to revisit this book, to glean more than just the basis of the story, the murder mystery. There is a wealth of knowledge to be had from this book; everything from day-to-day life in an abbey in the 1300's; to herbology; to theology....Eco has skillfully woven a glittering tapestry of insight into the lives of the brothers involved in this series of murders. But more about that some other time. <br />Eco has crafted a thrilling, intoxicating, thoroughly exhilarating chase through a labyrinth of murder, lust, greed, deception, and intrigue. First called upon to discern the cause of death of a young monk, Brother William arrives with his novice apprentice in tow, and immediately impresses all with his acumen at deciphering the details of a missing horse he has never laid eyes upon. He delivers not only path of travel and location, but also the name of the beast to the astonished monks searching high and low without success. <br />Brother William goes on to investigate the death, a fall from a high window in the abbey scriptorium, and is drawn into a series of further deaths that are each more baffling than the first. A body left in a vat of pigs blood; a corpse with blackened tongue and fingers in a tub of water...each new death serves to lessen the population of the abbey, but adds to the frustration and mystery plaguing Brother William as he tries to locate the killer before he can strike again.<br />William finds much more than anticipated in his investigations; a secret affair; a covert system of prostitution; a coveted path of succession; ancient remedies and poisons; not to mention jealousy, theft, and betrayal. <br />Compared with Baudolino, I must say that this book DOES have more style, and better pacing...but there seems to be no prevarication in his story-crafting skills from this; his first novel, published in the early 1980's, to twenty years later, with the release of his most recent work. Eco is a wonderful storyteller, enough so that I will have to give Island of the Day Before a third try, now that I know the promise of his works.<br />Though Name of the Rose is a first rate whodunit with a HIGHLY satisfactory conclusion; that is only the tip of what is to be found in the pages of the book. Eco invites readers to empty their minds of their day-to-day cares, and travel with him back to 1300's Italy, where he delivers a stunning display of life, faith, and political intrigue. <br />I cannot recommend this book more highly. A wonderfully entertaining read from start to finish.	2003-05-26

This time around was far more successful.<br />In reading other reviews, it seems everyone has an opinion on the 'quality' of the book, or the 'Beat Generation' and how this novel revolutionized (or didn't) literature at the time, and people's attitudes toward the younger generation. But what I find lacking is a review of the two main characters themselves, as all characters in the book were only 'fictionalizations' of real persons in Kerouac's life, amalgamations of qualities, actions, and characteristics of Kerouac and his friends. So, that is the spin I will put on my review of On The Road; what I saw in the journey of the two main characters themselves.<br />Sal Paradise, aspiring writer, continually hits the open road with a host of characters, most notably Dean Moriarty. Thirsting for life, and experience, and excitement, they cross the United States several times, with a few marriage and child stopovers for Dean along the way. But Sal and Dean, while thick as thieves, are starkly contrasting characters in terms of the development they achieve throughout their journeys. In these two characters you find one man who comes to realize at the end of his quest that everything he wanted was right where he started, much the same as Dorothy stated in the Wizard of Oz...you don't need to look any further than your own backyard. But Dean, Sal's frequent travel companion, proves that you can't find what you're looking for if you have no notion of what that is. Sal's hero-worship of Dean and the free-wheeling, risk taking, no-holds-barred life he leads eventually gives way to common sense and maturation. <br />Sal follows Dean's lead numerous times, which takes him to San Francisco, Denver, Mexico, and many places in between. Along the way a very colorful host of characters is encountered. Kerouac shows a highly skilled manner of description with people, places, and experiences. The story alternates between comical and somber, but never runs out of fuel.<br />Other reviewers have criticized the ending of the novel as being too serious in tone, which I find an unfair assessment. If the book as a whole is taken as one long journey for the protagonist; starting with a spur-of-the-moment decision to travel across the country to 'see some friends' or 'just because your friends did it' then a maturation at the end, a sense of taking life a little more seriously and deciding what you want from life and where you want to be is a logical conclusion. But in between these two points, the story flows seamlessly, much like Kerouac's purported method of writing it, by taping rolls of typing paper together to keep writing in a continuous stream of consciousness.<br />Kerouac's travel experiences in the 40's make for wonderful reading fare, and I was never disappointed or bored. As an escape from the mundane, every-day-the-same kind of life most adults lead...it cannot be beat.	2003-05-08

While initially I looked at the size of the book (a scant 313 pages) with disdain, compared to the Irving books that have preceeded it (Garp, Owen Meany, Son of the Circus, Widow for One Year); the story found inside these 313 pages is every bit as sizeable as the others.<br />Patrick Wallingford, a nationally known television journalist, gains further notoriety after losing his left hand during an assignment in India, and again when he undergoes surgery to replace it with a donor hand. Enter Doris Clausen, the widow of the donor, and Nick Zajac, the surgeon who performs the surgery. Dr. Zajac wants the fame associated with the surgery, should it be successful, but Doris Clausen wants something else...a baby, 'fathered' by her now deceased husband, and visitation rights to his hand, even after it is attached to Wallingford.<br />While Doris Clausen and Dr. Zajac go through transformations of their own during the course of the story, Wallingford, a devout womanizer and divorced man with little faith in his ability to be faithful to any one woman, finds that through the loss of his hand, and the subsequent events, he finds himself and his soul.<br />The story is typically Irving...with many recurring themes from prior novels. But Irving's adroit writing skill keeps them fresh and fascinating for this new tale. Anyone who has invested some (well spent, in my opinion) time reading past novels by the same author will see these themes, and relish the treatise that Irving once again gives them. <br />John Irving succeeds with this novel as with his others. Though to compare it in size to them it is to perhaps view it as 'dwarfed'.  But the story is as fully realized as any of his others. His quote at the end, puportedly placed above the door to the locker room of the Green Bay Packers football team, 'leave no regrets on the field' is poignant to the story and to the book itself...the characters come full circle in many ways, though perhaps not to the exact resolution they anticipated or desired, and I as a reader found that although I expected to be disappointed by what I considered a 'shortchanged' offering from Irving, I left no regrets between the covers of the book.<br />I highly recommend this book, to all fans of Irving, or to those who wish to give him a try.  Like his earlier novels, The Water Method Man, The 158 Pound Marriage, etc...its not the size of the story that counts, its the content inside. This book doesn't disappoint.	2003-04-24
US	49931260	R1UMFI4QVTKK3S	0140435387	46808097	Jude the Obscure (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Despair within and without	Prior to reading Jude the Obscure, I had a smattering of knowledge about the religious uproar it caused upon publication, which led Hardy to abandon novels and focus merely on poetry. His work being denounced and burned by the churches, Hardy felt that if that was to be the treatment of his work, he would no longer produce the work.<br />Now that I have read the novel, and  having attempted to place myself in the mindset of the later 19th century morals and ideals, I can begin to understand why such an uproar was raised.<br />First, the story...Jude Fawley, of poor and meager birth, aspires to academic greatness. When it is recommended to him that he stay on the 'blue collar' course he has begun, and not wish for more, he decides to educate himself, one day hoping that it will position him for greater things. <br />Jude enters into a hasty marriage, which by later standards would be described as a 'shotgun' wedding, which he eventually comes to regret, and ends. Enter his cousin Sue, who becomes the love of his life. Sue also ends an unsatisfactory first marriage, freeing herself to be with Jude, whom she loves as well.<br />What follows is a descent into tragedy and despair, with numerous twists and turns along the way. Not wanting to spoil them, I will not divulge.<br />However, the remainder of the novel touches upon many, many themes that amounted to raising of the ire of the church in response.  Divorce; childbirth out of wedlock; loss of faith in God; questioning religious ideals and teachings; all these and more are present in the latter half of the novel, and so much more.  <br />Upon finishing the book, I was left to question were these really Hardy's own feelings illustrated in his work, or simply a realization of a course of events for the characters, and not a reflection on the author's beliefs.  That, however, bears further reading on the life of Thomas Hardy.<br />Where I find fault with the novel is in the characters, and it is merely a distaste withtheir actions. Sue, the heroine, spends far too much time vacillating about her love for Jude and her desire to marry him. When Jude tries to do the right thing by Sue, and respect her wishes, she claims he has 'given up too easily, and doesn't seem at all disappointed'. Jude's first wife, Arabella, displays an utterly selfish, self-absorbed personality, and was, for me, unlikeble, and unsympathetic. Jude, a character capable of learning Latin and Greek and engaging in other scholarly pursuits, seems completely naive in the ways of the world, and further seems blinded by a sense of duty over a sense of the rights and wrongs of others. His actions make him appear to have no regard for himself, until the very end.<br />Perhaps this is exactly as Hardy meant the characters to be seen, perhaps not. I did enjoy the book more than I expected to, and apparently more than others who have said to me \\"What on earth are you reading THAT for???\\".  Hardy is not a comedy writer, and one should not expect a glamorous, cheerful, tidy ending, it does not exist here.<br />While not the greatest of classic novels I have read, I can certainly see why this one has been discussed for over 100 years. While Dickens peppered his stories with levity to break up the gloom, Hardy continues on a downward spiral, leaving his characters in despair within and without. I recommend it to readers who enjoy a good characterization of later 19th century life in England. But if you are looking for something to put a smile on your face, Hardy might not be for you.	2003-04-18
US	49931260	R1XA5LF94MW2E9	0345433041	198682031	A Citizen of the Country	Books	4	5	8	N	N	Third time is a charm, but.......	Having now finished Sarah Smith's Vanished Child Trilogy, I can conclude that the sequel is rarely ever as good as the original. <br />While Vanished Child thrilled, and Knowledge of Water disappointed, A Citizen of the Country strives to bring readers once again into the dark clouds that hang over Alexander Von Reisden since he was recognized and proven to be the missing Richard Knight, who vanished at the age of 8 on the night his grandfather was murdered; himself being the killer.<br />But this time around, Reisden and wife Perdita are parents to a happy, healthy boy. However, Reisden and Perdita are far from happy themselves. Reisden mistrusts his nearly blind wife to care properly for their son; Perdita strives to understand why Reisden has distanced himself from Gilbert Knight, a surviving Uncle of Richard's, who can end the financial woes of Jouvet, the psychiatric facility that Reisden owns, nearly destroyed in the Paris flood described in The Knowledge of Water.<br />Enter Maurice Cyron, who holds the key to delivering a Government contract to Jouvet that will ensure its financial well-being for years to come. Cyron charges Reisden to complete a task begun long ago at Jouvet, to help put to rest the demons of his adopted son, Andre, a friend of Reisden's youth. <br />Andre, the unbalanced host of alter-ego Necrosar, writes dark, murderous plays for a 'Theater of Horror' in Paris. Being shut in with his dead parents for days when just a young boy seems to have permanently unhinged Andre, though he has married a beautiful young woman, Sabine, who obsesses with bearing a child for Necrosar, whom she worships, herself a witch.<br />Andre and Cyron bring Reisden and company to Montfort, Andre's ancestral home, to film a treatment of Macbeth, a la Necrosar, complete with the beheading of the heroine, played by Sabine, by guillotine, as the culmination of the film.  But amidst all the make-believe death and gore, real bodies begin to turn up, and a mystery unfolds. Reisden and his friend Jules are blackmailed to uncover the 'secret of Montfort'...Jules' sister Ruthie uncovers Sabine's secret, and a witch's poison, which nearly claims her life. Tunnels below Montfort itself are found to be far more than just a challenging labyrinth, and Reisden is forced to overcome his owns demons about committing murder in order to help solve the mystery surrounding the death of one of the principal characters, lest an innocent person suffer the same fate.<br />Sound good? Technically it is...Smith delivers dark, gloomy prose, of the same ilk as Vanished Child. Citizen is far superior to Knowledge of Water, in the respect that, like Vanished Child, there was a central plot that the other sub-plots fed from, and that affected them all. The 'secret of Montfort', while not quite as exciting as I had hoped, feeds into all other plot-lines, like a body of water feeding tributaries.  Many demons are laid to rest by the end of the story, which is one of its strengths, a 'satisfying' conclusion for several of the story threads.<br />But where the novel fails to live up to the original is a lack of excitement when the 'secret' is finally revealed. The so-called 'secret' of Montfort is lackluster at best, and really not enough to keep perpetuating its mention time and again as a plot line.  Further, Smith shoots herself in the foot by foreshadowing the death of one of the principals in the story, so that when the event takes place, it is expected, and therefore not much of a shock.  While the first novel held my interest until the end to find out 'the truth', this novel does not deliver the same satisfaction.  A contrived 'resolution' (from the characters of the novel) does not really answer one of the major questions of the story; the identity of the person who commits the 'shocking' murder.  It seems as though Smith, in the hopes of a resolution for all the characters involved, left out a resolution for the reader.<br />That said, I do recommend reading this book if you have already read the other two. Without having them as a background, many things here will not make much sense to a reader, and although the story can be read autonomously, a foundation of the first two parts of this trilogy only adds to the overall read.<br />I sincerely hope that Smith will revisit the characters, and expand this trilogy into something larger. She is a capable writer, with a talent for creating a hazy, gloomy setting, and painting equally despairing characters to populate that setting.	2003-04-02
US	49931260	R2CSNPQG1N6Y87	0192835750	557004951	The Three Musketeers (Oxford World's Classics)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A timeless, classic story that has it all.....	In 'Musketeers' Alexandre Dumas set the stage for future works as he introduced readers to the exploits and adventures of D'Artagnan and his friends Athos, Aramis, and Porthos, a.k.a. The Three Musketeers. Subsequent books follow, telling further adventures 'Twenty Years Later' and 'Ten Years After' that. But in Musketeers, readers meet the young D'Artagnan and his trio of swashbuckling companions for the first time.<br />Trying to classify the story into one genre is an exercise in futility, as it encompasses so many.  But to me, it is most of all a comedy. Many, many times I found myself chuckling while reading the foibles of French manners in the 17th century, as chronicled in the 19th century by Dumas. The Musketeers are warriors, spies, womanizers, drunkards; but above all they are gentlemen. Two men about to duel discuss a salve one offers the other to heal a prior wound; A lackey who is ordered not to speak is reprimanded for bringing news that will spare the Musketeers from harm and trying to deliver it to them; a duel is avoided as there is not sufficient time to fight it properly; and an innkeeper is maligned for not having better wines in his cellar while one of the Musketeers holes up there for days after not paying his bill.<br />While the action is well plotted, and the storyline twists and turns are plausible and palpable, the most intriguing, captivating, and charming aspect of this story for me was its humor.  In a world full of formulaic, contrived 'adventure tales' it was a treat to step back in time several hundred years and find a real adventure story. Classics survive for a reason, while other stories are relegated to the bargain bins. While Dumas was not exactly thought of as 'high quality' literature, and his intelligence has been the subject of discourse and debate, he had a clever way with words, characters, and stories. His plot here is not at all overblown, and while his characters may be larger than life, their life isn't. Even as his 'over the top' anti-heroes cross blades again and again with the Cardinal Richelieu's forces, bed women time and again, fight off attack after attack, and escape certain death more than once, the world they live in never seems like a work of fiction.<br />In contrast to Count of Monte Cristo, this book is only 'lighter' in the manner in which the story is unfolded. While that book had a much darker theme, this story is every bit as engrossing.  I am happy to have saved this book to savor in adulthood, and highly recommend reading the adventures of the Musketeers to anyone with a love for classics.ver the top' anti-heroes cross blades again and again with the Cardinal Richelieu's forces, bed women time and again, fight off attack after attack, and escape certain death more than once, the world they live in never seems like a work of fiction. <br />In contrast to Count of Monte Cristo, this book is only 'lighter' in the manner in which the story is unfolded.

US	49931260	R2BYGMJC5YUZDH	0151006903	99041831	Baudolino	Books	5	13	13	N	N	A Tangled Web	Unlike other reviewers, I do not have a foundation of Eco, as this is my first attempt to read him. Some have said that this novel is far more accessible than his others. Having owned a copy of Island of the Day Before for 3 years now and never getting past page 4....I must confess that this novel pulled me in almost immediately; so much so that it took me only 5 days to finish it.<br />Baudolino is a 'retelling' , of sorts, of the history of Constantinople; of myths and fables surrounding the former city; of Emporer Frederik Barbarossa; of the Holy Grail; of the extinction of the mythical Unicorn, and so much more. Packaging so many different tales of wonder into one novel, Eco succeeds as keeping a focused, discernible narrative throughout, the life of Baudolino as witness, interpreter, and chronicler of all these events.<br />Adopted at an early age by the Emporer, Baudolino adapts easily to a more privileged life than that of a poor man's child. While not forgetting his heritage, Baudolino makes use of his new station and ventures to Paris to continue his studies. While there, he meets other youths who are to become life-long companions.  The Poet, who apparently never writes a line of original verse, being on of the most prevalent and influential of his companions, and one of the most developed characters other than the narrator.<br />Baudolino returns to the court of the Emporer, having learned to craft fanciful and believable tales to delight and enthrall others, and making use of this skill so far as to set off on a quest to find the fabled 'Prestor John' and bring the Holy Grail to him. Neither, of course, are factual to this tale, but Baudolino does not let that deter him, or his companions, from their quest.<br />Following the death of the Emporer under questionable circumstances, Baudolino and company are flung into a further mission, to recover the 'Grail', which has disappeared, along with one of their traveling companions.<br />Here the book delves into mythical territory, as Baudolino and company encounter beings and creatures that only fantasy can create and sustain. But as most of Baudolino's life is wrapped up in fantasy that he has created, none of it seems anything but commonplace to him and his fellow travelers.<br />While I am not a fan of fantasy novels, this fits seamlessly into the story told, as in describing this type of journey into a 'fantasy' land, of course the details are made up and embellished to the best ability of the author of the story. Eco, through Baudolino's voice, creates a wonderous land of creatures, places, and events that let the imagination soar into lands that most leave behind with their childhoods. This story, while mostly invention, touches upon many factual themes, people, and events.  It informs, enlightens, and best of all entertains with what could be a dry, turgid history lesson, no matter how colorful the history of Constantinople. The blending of actual history with myth, and the adept imagination of Eco, works on many levels.<br />I highly recommend this book as a starting point for those interested in reading Umberto Eco. While purportedly not as well-crafted as Focault's Pendulum and The Name of the Rose (two more Eco novels that I will now have to investigate) it is a well-written and highly enjoyable foray into myth, fantasy, legend, and fact.	2003-03-01
US	49931260	R2NO9GD4R6TDB	0312269463	829154026	The Ten Thousand: A Novel of Ancient Greece	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Broken Promise	The Ten Thousand is a novel filled with promise. The march of Xenophon across ancient Greece; the battles fought; the victories; the defeats; the trials of starvation; deadly weather; and the sheer determination and perserverance of those who survived.  The story alone is breathtaking, without filling in the details.<br />Michael C. Ford knows the details; the bitter cold, the ancient healing rituals applied to cauterize wounds and keep untanned leather sandal straps from biting into flesh as they shrink...all of these details fit nicely into the daily occurances of the soldiers that followed Xenophon on his march.<br />Now to get to the 'however'...What I have to lament in having read this novel is; first, there is no clear focus to the story. Although it is supposed to be about Xenophon, though told through the eyes of another protagonist; the story skips back and forth from Xenophon to the protagonist, to battles here and there, it lacks a compelling focal point. <br />Second; the characters are almost completely devoid of emotional development. To cite a few examples; at the beginning, a foundation is given that Xenophon is nothing short of a disappointment to his father, and desperately strives to please him. Seemingly it would follow that his actions and decisions would reflect that desire to emulate his father. The protagonist, Themostigenes, develps an affair with the Persian woman Asteria, who holds a knife to him during a physical encounter. The overwhelming attraction to this woman is never explored other than to toss her in occasionally as Theo needs a 'quickie' to tide him over. He risks life and limb for this woman, and the reader never really gets a sense of why. And the woman, Asteria, could apparently have had any man in Xenophon's army that she desired, why Theo? None of these questions are answered. The characters are all two-dimensional at best, and their motivations are non-existent.<br />Third, there is no real sense of pace to the story, and the climax of the story is lacking in drama and suspense that one might expect to find at the end of such a march as Xenophon led his men on. Granted in everyday life there isn't always a grand finale to events, but...we aren't all writing books about our day to day lives. This is a story of epic potential; written about for thousands of years; studied for its strategic planning and cunning. It seems logical to expect a little more than a tepid ending to such a tale. <br />I give Michael Ford credit for tackling this tale as the subject of a novel. It does show his interest and affection for the ancient world, though his adeptness at putting it on paper needs work. I hope that his future novels will explore ancient Greece again. As they say, practice makes perfect. I eagerly await what this promising writer can really produce.	2003-02-23
US	49931260	R22ZNPVLWVX5VN	0679741917	687848767	The Immoralist	Books	2	22	27	N	N	Life is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving....	I acquired Andre Gide's The Immoralist from a pile of free books set outside a used book store that was closing for good.  I brought it home and set it aside for about a month before reading it. <br />The 170-odd pages were very easy to digest, in terms of time and complexity. But the ideas filling them were intriguing, at least at first. A man marries, develops tuberculosis, convalesces, and decides to live life more deliberately, more fundamentally, and expose himself, his emotions, his experiences, down to their very foundation. He embraces the pain of sunburn for it's capacity to make a person feel, for the sensation it produces. He strips away all layers of clothing in the outdoors to plunge into an icy pool of water, to expose himself completely to the elements and the world around him. He gives up his scholarly pursuits to run a family farm, and experience a completely different type of life and industry.<br />But here the intrigue of the premise becomes mired in an obviously closeted gay man (not uncommon for the turn of the 20th century) torn between duty to wife and honesty of desire. The second half of this brief novel is merely an endless parade of boys and men that draw Michel's attention and ardor. The desire to experience all in its most basic, honest form is lost in the lie that Michel obviously lives in suppressing his hidden desires and perpetuating his sham marriage.<br />While Gide's concept was initally enough to draw me in and press me to read on, the latter half of the book left me apathetic to my inceptive appreciation of a very promising idea. I found the character of Michel to be hypocritical at best, and failed to feel any sympathy for his longing after the neverending parade of males that slip through his fingers, and his fickle interest in them. I felt some sympathy for Marceline, Michel's wife, but his narrative portrayal of her as more of an impedence and a nuisance gave me more cause to pity her than feel empathy for her eventually contracted case of tuberculosis, no matter how frail she grew; the author always managed to make her more of an annoyance to Michel than anything else, and her character never really has an opportunity of true definition.<br />Gide has a very accessible way with prose, but not a very clear and concise focus on his story with this book, which is the first of his works that I have read. All in all, this book suffers from \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" syndrome...and disproves its initial 'thesis'. I would not recommend this book to others, save for anyone interested in examining the conflict of a closeted gay married man at the turn of the 20th century.	2003-02-04

Many authors entertain me; many amuse me; and still others enlighten me. But James Baldwin does all those things, and more. James Baldwin makes me feel.<br />After finishing if Beale Street Could Talk today, I wondered how to write a review of it; what event, what character would spark my creative thoughts enough to build upon. But Beale Street isn't about a person, or an event. At least not to me. Beale Street is about love.<br />Tish and Fonny feel love, love for one another. Love that is made up of passion, and trust, and longing. Love that creeps up on you and then settles into your heart like a foot going into an old, broken-in slipper. Love so powerful that life springs from it, when Tish finds herself pregnant. Love that keeps Fonny hopeful when he is put in jail for a crime he didn't commit, and keeps Tish going back to the jail day after day to see Fonny and keep his spirits up.<br />Joseph and Frank feel love. Love for their wives; love for their children; love for one another and the bond their families now share that is symbolized by the baby Tish carries. Love strong enough to blame themselves for their childrens' shortcomings; love strong enough to band together to do whatever is necessary to keep their children together to raise the baby they have made.<br />Sharon feels love for her daughter; a love that takes her to Puerto Rico, looking for the woman who has accused Fonny of raping her, to clear his name and get him out of jail so that he can be with Tish when the baby is born. Love that keeps her going back again and again to get at the truth, no matter what danger it puts her in.<br />Beale Street is brief, but complex in its dissection of the loves that encompass us all our lives; love for parents, children, siblings, lovers, and families. Baldwin's eloquent and elegant prose sings from each page,  examining love from all angles, and its components. <br />James Baldwin was an amazing author. Though his novels were written about African-Americans, his words speak to everyone. I highly recommend Beale Street. It is more than a novel; it is a work of art.	2003-01-29

From the great aunt abandoned on her wedding night by a husband fleeing in her gown to meet his male lover for a moonlight sail...to the bitter rivalry of two feuding clans employed in the family business that end up in tragedy; to the great uncle who disappears with the ocean current one dark night; to young Aurora da Gama, who marries a foreman in the family business and eventually delivers Moor into the world, born with a club right hand, and a body that ages at twice the normal rate.  <br />No matter how colorful his lineage, Moor's own story is as lively and entertaining as that of his family as he alternately blesses and curses his 'afflictions'; loses his heart on more than one occasion, and eventually strives to make a name for himself when the family banishes him. <br />Rushdie's wry, double-entendre brand of humor brought too many smiles to my face to count, or give the details of. His descriptive powers are almost lyrical at times, his wit both scathing and coy, and his emotions real enough to penetrate the hearts of all. The Moor endears, enrages, and enlightens all in the fictional world he inhabits, and all those drawn into it by reading Rushdie's prose.<br />Thankfully there are many other Rushdie novels to indulge in, and I am happy to have discovered a 'new' writer to add to my bookshelves.	2003-01-27

They told me that although Sarah Smith carried characters from The Vanished Child over to this book, it would not be just a rehash of the first one.<br />However, even if one does not compare the content of the two books, the first one is far superior, as all events turn on the central thread of the novel, the story of the 'vanished child'.<br />Smith chose as her central thread here the Paris flood of 1910. However, that thread frays early on, leaving too many scattered ends drifting like flotsam in the flooded Seine. <br />Once again, Alexander Von Reisden is the anti-hero of the story, along with Perdita, his partially sighted fiancee, who dreams of a career as a concert pianist. Perdita knows that she ultimately cannot commit to marriage, as she will one day leave to follow her passion. Reisden, still haunted by the death of his first wife (events described in Vanished Child) is content to simply let the relationship carry on as is; the same as Perdita. But, even though both feel that there is no real future for their love, passion eventually overtakes them. <br />Enter Roy Dougherty, police officer and friend from home (Boston) who quite correctly deduces that the relationship has progressed to being far from platonic, with the usual consequences.<br />Reisden is called in for questioning in the matter of a dead girl, the 'Mona Lisa'. He aides the police as much as possible, since he knew the girl in passing, and begins receiving notes asking him to 'do right by her' and see that she is 'taken care of'. Reisden and the police deduce that it is her killer making these requests, and set out to trap him. <br />Perdita, as well as Reisden, is drawn into an art forgery investigation, along with Dougherty, headstrong writer Milly Xico, and Reisden's 'cousin' Dotty, all convinced that Dotty's 'original Mallais painting' is nothing of the sort. Perdita takes up residence next to the widow Mallais and her shut-in brother Yvaud, befriending the kindly old woman, and soon learns that not all is as it seems. <br />The book is well written, but the story is what suffers from a lack of development. The central thread of this book seems to bounce back and forth. The flood; the art forgery; the dead girl; the well-meaning killer; Perdita's musical career; Reisden's mental clinic....too many focal points for one story. While I enjoyed the author's style and brand of prose once again, I was sad to see that nothing gelled into a main storyline, at least not for me. Most conflicts are resolved by the last page, but...with so many different story threads, it is hard to really enjoy any of them completely. Just when you are drawn in to one particular sub-plot the story shifts to another.<br />I eagerly await reading the third novel in the trilogy, A Citizen of the Country, as the reviews and book description all praise it highly. <br />I can only give this book 3 stars, however, and in comparison with part 1, it pales. Hopefully part 3 will even the score.	2003-01-04
US	49931260	R1XJ37IVIV4IBS	0345381645	237729417	The Vanished Child	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Thrilling Thriller	Writing a 'period thriller' in this day and age must be a daunting task. No real car chases; no internet spying; no satellite explosions; no nuclear threats;...But Sarah Smith manages to create a thrilling piece of fiction out of the woods of New Hampshire and Boston in 1906 in bringing readers the story of the Vanished Child.<br />Alexander Von Reisden never expected to be recognized as the 'vanished' Richard Knight eighteen years after the boy disappears. But when Richard's former doctor Charlie Adair approaches him on a European train platform, he is drawn into the mystery that Richard left behind...a murdered grandfather, an unclaimed inheritance...a missing secretary...and no answers in sight.<br />Reisden travels to Boston to 'help' the Knight family find those answers, implying that he is not Richard, but all the while leaving a shadow of a doubt in everyone's minds. <br />In Boston, he encounters Gilbert Knight, the dowdy, dithering uncle of the missing Richard; Harry Boulding, the favored heir who stands to inherit millions upon the legal declaration of Richard's demise, and Perdita, Harry's fiance and Charlie Adair's niece. Reisden opens a full-scale search and investigation into the disappearance of Richard, as well as Jay French, the secretary to Richard's grandfather William, and the murder of William himself. Reisden becomes enmeshed in the Knight family background; searching for the history of a boy when he in fact has no memory of his own early childhood.<br />Sarah Smith entertained me greatly with this novel. It is appropriately moody and dark, the language reads with authenticity to the time period of the story, and although the author admits to 'bending timeline' a bit to make certain events fit her story...it is not bent enough to break continuity or believability. As a Boston resident I enjoyed many location descriptions and sank comfortably into the history of the city I now call home.<br />My only real critiques are: Some confusion with calling Reisden by the name Richard occasionally, in narrative, to further the thought that...'maybe' he is Richard after all; and for an undeveloped thread regarding the death of Reisden's wife, and for naming the Boston Common Frog Pond inappropriately as site of Swan Boat paddling...as well as some loose ends that are not tied up with the ending.<br />This is well worth the read, regardless of these criticisms. After reading that this was a planned trilogy all along, perhaps any lingering questions will be answered.  And knowing that there are two other books to follow, I cannot wait to indulge myself in the others.	2002-12-11

Blackwood Farm revisits the South that Anne Rice loves so well, and treated us to a view of in past novels such as The Witching Hour and The Feast of All Saints. She dishes out to us a giant helping of deep southern lore and hospitality, exploring the perils and disgraces of the Blackwood family from its beginnings. <br />Quinn Blackwood, the narrator of this chronicle, reveals all of the Blackwood family history to the Vampire Lestat, whose aid he has enlisted to help rid himself of his doppelganger, Goblin, who has plagued him since birth. First a simple, laughing child along with Quinn, then teenaged seducer and lover, now something darker; more demonic and vengeful since Quinn was given the Dark Blood. Goblin has become a threat to Quinn and all those he loves, and perhaps the most lethal ghost that this wealthy Louisiana family has ever known.<br />From patriarch \\"Mad\\" Manfred Blackwood, to \\"Aunt Queen\\" the family sage and 'childless Mother to all', to \\"Pops\\" and \\"Sweetheart\\", the only real 'parental figures' Quinn ever really had, to his mother Patsy, the wandering country music queen wanna-be whom he despises, Anne Rice paints a full and complete picture of a Southern Family replete with ghosts, secrets, and shames through many decades, as Quinn reveals to Lestat his long history with Goblin, as well as the family's own history with spirits, and how long buried corpses have risen to haunt the family, and him, anew.<br />The Mayfair Witches are interwoven into this tale, with an older and wiser Michael Curray and Rowan Mayfair seen as guardians of Mona Mayfair, the newly apointed designee of the Mayfair billions, who captures Quinn's young heart. Merrick Mayfair also visits this tale, and a new member of the Talamasca, Stirling Oliver, is present as well, as all play a part in Quinn's desire to rid himself of Goblin forever.<br />The story, while only briefly touching upon ancient times and civilizations, as Rice has done in past Vampire tales, reads like a dark tabloid tell-all about the Blackwoods, and the secrets they hide in the swamps of Louisiana. Anne Rice does not need to wander far from her own backyard to provide an enthralling story of a vampire's history. For that I give her four stars, and a fond thank you for reinvigorating my waning interest in the vampires.<br />I take one star away from Anne Rice for a rushed ending. While the rest of the book plays out well and adequately paints a portrait of the Blackwoods, the last several chapters seem to pass up many opportunities with the storyline. And while I enjoyed this book tremendously, I question the focus in certain places, as the story seems to stray too far from its original premise, Quinn seeking out Lestat to help rid him of Goblin.<br />However, this is a fine addition to the Chronicles of the Vampires overall, is a very entertaining read, and captured my attention from page one until the end. I am happy to see Anne Rice breath new life into her cast of undead, and see hope for the damned, as it were, that they will live on in novels for years to come.	2002-11-07

Having read Children of the Night and Fires of Eden both, which have adult incarnations of characters from Summer of Night, I enjoyed seeing another variation of that. As was the case with so many others, Summer of Night was a book that touched me in a wonderfully nostalgic way, even for a horror tale.<br />A Winter Haunting strives to bring us back to the horrors of Elm Haven, or at least a small corner of it. The McBride farm was the home of Duane McBride, childhood chum of the protagonist of this novel, Dale Stewart. Duane, a quasi-narrator for this tale, was murdered in Elm Haven when just 11 years old. Now Dale, 51, author and English professor, has returned to his hometown to rent Duane's home to write his latest novel, and revisit the horrors of Elm Haven. Freshly separated from his wife and daughters in Montana; abandoned by his decamped mistress Clare; Dale is depressed and suicidal...and in revisiting the horrors of Elm Haven, Dale finds a few new ones joining them upon his return.<br />However, an intriguing premise very quickly becomes a paradox here. Dale has visions of a soldier in a cemetery; black dogs appear from nowhere to stalk him, metaphorically referring to his depression, as Winston Churchill termed his own the 'Black Dog'; childhood acquaintances come back to 'haunt' Dale; a room in the McBride house produces 'amorous' desires in a man suffering from medication-induced impotence; a group of skinheads threatens Dale time and again over a series of articles he published;  and a voice from beyond seems to guide him in his quest to retain his sanity as the horrors of Elm Haven are once again unleashed upon him at a fever-pitch.<br />But don't get too excited...only a few of these riddles are answered by the end of the book.  Only the tangible elements of this conundrum are explained.<br />I enjoyed revisiting Elm Haven with Dan Simmons as the tour guide.However, there are lengthy passages of this book that really don't fit, and are wasted space in a 300 page novel.  Too much is left to imagination, or just plain unexplained, by the time the end of the tale is reached. Perhaps Mr. Simmons wanted it that way...that the events are just as unexplainable to the reader as they were to the character...perhaps a publishing deadline overshadowed the fleshing out of the details...or perhaps I simply want too much from a horror tale.<br />Whatever the case, I am glad to have strolled down Main Street Elm Haven again, but unfortunately this Winter tale won't haunt me for very long.	2002-10-24

From page one of this novel, his first loosely autobiographical piece about growing up gay, I was bewitched, bothered, and bewildered by him once again. <br />I have now read his first-person narrative trilogy in full, though out of sequence, and each book is captivating. While this, his early adolescence, is not as sexually charged as the others, it is still replete with the same auto-erotica that emanates from his fertile imagination in the subsequent pieces of the work as a whole. <br />The protagonist, still unnamed, draws readers into his world of summers at the lake with his well-off family; his first tentative sexual liaisons; his forays into the world of heterosexual 'normalcy', his escape from parochial school to the comforts of an all-boys private academy, and his reluctant quest to discover his homosexual self. Through the pages of this novel, the boy takes diffident steps out of the closet, even in the 1950's, when such actions were decidedly more taboo than in present day, yet White's experience can be understood by all who have come out, whether it were 1955, 1985, or 2002. <br />White takes his narrator, and the reader, through the highs and lows of self doubt and self awareness; through numerous quests for love and acceptance; through the dangers and disappointments of trying to conceal your true nature from the world and yourself, and finally through the daunting labors of disclosure of his homosexual tendencies to others. In the finale, the protagonist arrives, albeit in a disturbing way, at childhood's end, and forges ahead toward adulthood.<br />Ever present are White's frank, revealing takes on being gay. No matter what your age; no matter what the year, White's voice speaks to all. His trilogy of growing up gay in the 50's and 60's and being gay in the 70's, 80's, and beyond is among the finest examples of gay literature I have ever read.	2002-10-21

For Edmond Dantes, these words kept him alive in the nearly 2 decades of imprisonment at the Chateau D'If. Unjustly placed there upon return to the port of Marseilles; made scapegoat for a Bonapartist action which he had no involvement with, Dantes is torn from his life as sailor, fiance, and son, and tossed into the darkness of solitary confinement, left to rot; untried, unexplained, and forgotten.<br />Many years later, hope comes in the form of an ailing prisoner trying to tunnel his way out. He confides his greatest secret, the hiding place of an immense fortune, to Dantes before he dies. Seeing this as his only chance at freedom, Dantes assumes the place of the corpse, is removed from the prison for 'burial', and escapes. <br />Thus begins his revenge. After collecting the very real wealth in the cavern on Monte Cristo, he assumes the title of Count, and exacts his vengeance on those who stole his life. <br />The Count; benefactor, patron, and friend of the elite, insinuates himself into the lives of those who deprived him of all he loved, and authors their downfalls. All the while rewarding the good and just, he prepares punishment for those who are deserving.<br />The book is entertaining from start to finish and was well worth the read. The Count's revenge is deserved, and well doled out, as he allows all to destroy themselves with their wrongdoing, simply supplying them the means. The ending is not so grand scale as to be Hollywood-esque in scope, but satisfying nonetheless. Dantes realizes that in following his path of revenge he has simply placed himself in another 'prison,' that of hatred, and he tempers his actions with deeds of generosity and gratitude, perhaps as a measure of atonement. But no matter what ills befall those who betrayed him, you constantly root for Dantes to emerge triumphant. <br />The more classic literature I read, such as Count of Monte Cristo, the easier it is to see why good literature survives the test of time.	2002-10-15

White chose the title to this novel from Haydn's The Farewell Symphony, in which, as the musical piece nears conclusion, the musicians leave the stage, one by one, until there is a sole violinist remaining, who finishes the work that so many others began.<br />In White's novel, we are taken on a tour of the protagonist's (White himself) 30's, 40's, and 50's as he climbs from unknown author to celebrated chronicler of gay life. Along the way, White bares his soul through his no-holds-barred sexual confessions, as we see him interract with friends, lovers, and back-alley liaisons.<br />Beginning post-Stonewall, and culminating in the AIDS crisis we witness White in many scenarios: best friend, object of desire, live-in lover, and even surrogate parent. White envelops each role with his particularly magical brand of prose, sentiment, and bravado, that is sometimes shocking, sometimes sad, but always entertaining. <br />As the novel carries on, and reaches the now 20 year old beginning of the AIDS epidemic, we see the significance and poignancy of the title, as the disease ravages the ranks of White's friends, and leaves him the one violinist remaining to chronicle their lives, as they intertwined with his own.<br />From backrooms to bedrooms, from parking lots to Paris, with stops in New York, Venice, and Morrocco along the way, White delivers another triumph in chronicling his life, and what began as A Boy's Own Story becomes the life of a man.	2002-08-24

I picked it up now; having just read Coldheart Canyon, and being really wowed by that, as I was a few years ago with Great and Secret Show.<br />But this work didn't really wow me. The story is good, very good, about a gambler on the run from evil. But it lacks in certain elements to make it a 'thriller' or even more thrilling to read. <br />Joseph Whitehead made his fortune after being touched by evil. His empire is vast, his admirers many, his friends few and far between. Seeking out a new bodyguard, Whitehead employs Martin Strauss, a convict serving the latter half of his sentence. Strauss is only too willing to leave the prison walls for Whitehead's vast estate, on a 'work release program' but soon finds a lot more than he bargained for. Whitehead, a bit of a recluse, has turned his estate into a sort of fortress, hiding from more than just gold-diggers and nosey reporters.<br />Whitehead's assistant, Bill Toy, and daughter, Carys, befriend Strauss, helping him adjust to life on the outside, and life with Joseph Whitehead. Carys, a heroin addict, and willing 'prisoner' of the estate, in order to secure her fixes, becomes a sort of 'love interest' for Marty, as well as a confidante.<br />But before long, Strauss is chasing strange intruders who mysteriously penetrate the outer security fences with no real explanation, and burying horribly murdered guard dogs in the woods. Strange sensations creep into his mind, and his dreams become fevered with dark visions. Is Carys really an innocent victim of a sad addiction? Are the intruding strangers really strangers? And is Whitehead a victim, or merely a debtor trying to avoid his obligation when his creditor has come to collect?<br />Damnation Game is entertaining, full of Barker's twisted imaginings and horrors. But again, it didn't wow me. Marty is a lackluster hero for the story, and Carys an anti-heroine love interest. I never found myself really rooting for either or the two of them as a pair to emerge victorious in their struggles. The debtor that comes to call on Whitehead is justified in his claim, therefore Whitehead is hard to sympathize with as well. Empathy, surely, can be felt for the man, but sympathy is hard earned by the character.<br />The ending of the story, as well, left me a little unsatisfied, and wanting a bit more, or a bit better. For the build-up of malevolence in the 'debtor,' his resolution is a bit weak.<br />While not as much a page-turner as other Clive Barker books, Damnation Game is an entertaining read, especially for Barker fans, as one of his earlier, lesser known works.	2002-08-12

Congo is the first. I give it 2 stars...for story, as it was highly entertaining, enough so that I read all 310 pages in a day, something I don't normally do.<br />But with this book it was easy. The story IS indeed interesting...a slaughtered Congo expedition team, a fragmented surveilance video giving enough evidence to suspect animal involvement, and a replacement team being sent in to gather facts, and complete the mission of the original team, along with an ASL speaking gorilla, Amy.<br />The book takes many twists along the way, as the American team races against the 'Consortium' team, a German-Japanese spoiler troop coveting the same prize as the Americans. But the consortium is a 'phantom menace' in this novel, as the only threat is the one that we read about, they never actually 'appear' in the novel.<br />Where the book fails is this: The characters are very two, if not one dimensional...save for Peter Elliot, the gorilla's trainer...and the gorilla, Amy. They provide not only comic relief, but a brief glimpse that the others in this novel are supposed to be actual humans. Karen Ross, the hot-headed, brilliant research team leader, Munro, the quasi-mercenary jungle guide, and the rest of the troop never, ever flesh out as characters, making them forgettable, and unsympathetic when danger hits the group...and the endless stream of facts and figures, that really have no bearing on the plot, which Crichton feels compelled to lace every chapter with. They neither drive the story along, nor illuminate anything about the characters really, and are merely filler. I found myself recognizing them early on, like a mention of the largest solar flare of 1979 in conjuction with a solar incident making a satellite connection impossible, and ultimately began to skip over entire paragraphs, or even pages of the book. It's not that I don't enjoy learning, but this is a thriller novel, not a textbook. Perhaps Crichton should write in both genres, as he apparently has enough subject matter in his mind for both.<br />Again, this is an entertaining read, if not an indepth one. But having seen other translations of Crichton novels onto the big screen, I find that I am FAR more entertained by his work in that medium, rather than the written word.	2002-08-04

He dresses and plays the part of the dutiful prep school student by day, but once class is out, he drifts toward the bohemians, gracing the coffee shops of their 1950's and 60's lives, watching them paint, sharing their surrealist literature and poetry, and secretly lusting after the males.  A child of divorced parents, his father determined to make a man out of him, his mother convinced that all he needs is a cure, the narrator carries us along on his ride, meeting many notable characters along the way, that shape and influence his gradual acceptance that he is gay.<br />Following his school years, when he enters the work force and the real world, the words of a school-friend come back to haunt him, that 'some day he will have too much freedom,' freedom to choose where he goes, what he does, and who he is. He drifts along from job to job, from lover to lover, Lou, Fred, and the frequent pick-ups from Christoper Street, until he meets Sean, a closeted young man who leads 'Bunny' to question his own identity as they both enter group therapy to try and overcome their 'illness' and go straight, with very different results.<br />Culminating at the famous Stonewall site, Edmund White provides readers with a grand tour-de-force of growing up gay in the 50's and 60's in Chicago and New York.  <br />Sometimes poignant, sometimes emotional, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, 'Beautiful Room' is a beautiful book, with a beautiful story to tell. The narrator, presumably White himself, as the book is supposed to be autobiographical, slips from identity to identity as he tries to find his own. Young and unsure of himself, he tries to be what everyone else wants him to be until he finds himself. <br />Although this story centers on a gay man, the book speaks volumes to anyone struggling to find their own identity, and the choices and mistakes we all make along the way.	2002-08-04

Coldheart Canyon is the first Clive Barker I have read in years, since Great and Secret Show.  Barker's last few novels have garnered so-so reviews, and quite honestly have kept me at bay as far as reading his works.<br />However, Coldheart Canyon proved too tempting to pass up. The novel delivers on all the levels that Barker is famous for...crossing the genres of horror and fantasy...graphic sexual indulgence, meticulous gore....detail after horrific detail is woven into a good old fashioned ghost story, set in Hollywood.<br />Todd Pickett, Hollywood 'A-list' action hero, knows his star is fading, and his box office draw is showing it's age, as well as his looks. On the advice of the head of Paramount Studios, he sees a plastic surgeon for a face lift, which throws him into seculsion while the healing process takes place. <br />Enter the home of Katya Lupi, a Hollywood mansion built in the first half of the 20th century for a movie star of the 20's. This 'Dream Palace' was once the site of Hollywood's most notorious orgies, where Men and Women, Men and Men, Women and Women, gathered together to indulge in their wildest fantasies, in a Hollywood that has all but been forgotten. Now, in the present day, not only does the house still contain elegant fixtures, furniture, and trimmings...it also contains Katya Lupi, still as young, vibrant, and luminescent as she was 80 years before.<br />The secret of her 'Fountain of Youth?' A tiled room, transported from Romania in the 20's, piece by piece, by Katya's lover Willem Zeffer, that depicts a fabled hunt, in which a warrior Duke dared to slaughter the Devil's son, incurring the wrath of Lilith, the Queen of Hell. But upon entering this room, you are drawn in to the power it holds, and face the realization that it is more than just tiles and paint...it is a whole other universe...where anything is possible.<br />Todd, along with his agent, the head of his fan club, and a few other Hollywood notables, are drawn into Katya'sworld, Coldheart Canyon, which is not only inhabited by her, but by the ghosts of several other Hollywood luminaries of yesteryear; Valentino, Barrymore, Clara Bow, Mary Pickford....to name a few. Each of whom were guests of her infamous 'parties', visitors to the tiled room, and whose spirit forms want nothing more than to cross the religious icons in the door thresholds keeping them outside in the canyon and gain access to the room, to feel its power once more.<br />With as many twists and turns as the Pacific Coast Highway, Coldheart Canyon is entertaining from start to finish. Just when you think the story has reached a conclusion, Barker takes it a notch further. A classic ghost story, a capable thriller, and a good old fashioned Hollywood history lesson, Coldheart Canyon will haunt a reader for a long time after the last page is read.	2002-08-01

While reading 'Another Country', I found myself doing this time and time again.<br />The suicide death of one character leads all the rest to explore their own theories of what lead to the act, as well as their own feelings about that character, and even about themselves. A mixture of black and white, educated and non-educated, well-to-do and poor, talented and average, each of them is greatly affected by the death, and what follows.  Some friends become lovers, some become enemies. An interracial relationship is formed, forcing each to examine the rage, biases, hatred, and prejudices against the other's race, and their own, that they never really knew existed inside of them.<br />While largely about racial tensions, and an examination of how blacks and whites, men and women, view one another, the book also explores many other themes; the theory of an innate bisexuality that exists in all of us, and the desire to explore that as an extension of love that we feel for someone, regardless of their gender; the cause and effects of jealousy; the intensity of love, longing, and guilt; and the consequences of betrayal.<br />James Baldwin manages to remove each character from all race and gender labeling, and bring them to their most elemental form: human. Flawed, feeling, passionate, caring humans.<br />'Another Country' is a book that I hope will stay with me for years to come.   Each character, each setting, each conflict is painted so vividly that all are someone, somewhere, something that you have known.  Emotionially gripping, honest, and sensual, this is a book I highly recommend.	2002-07-20

In the works of Charles Dickens, a reader can find many valuable life lessons threaded into the myraid plots, subplots, and character diversions. In Our Mutual Friend, those life lessons are no less abundant than in other works that I have read.<br />Perhaps the darkest Dickens novel, in terms of plot-driving devices; murders, theft, blackmail, beatings and the lot, the reader is left to derive the lesson each is there to offer. The story, lacking in a real hero or heroine as a focal point, is a far bleaker portrait of English society than in his past works.<br />However, woven into these dim themes, Dickens has interjected his typical wit and joviality to lighten even the blackest of plot twists.<br />Of course the usual roster of colorful, lively Dickens characters grace the pages of this book, although the novel is seemingly bereft of a hero and heroine, at least in the traditional sense. However; the denizens of Dickens' world in this novel will entertain and enchant every bit as much as in his other works.<br />Dickens imparts many words of wisdom in the pages of this book, his last completed novel: Money cannot buy happiness; be careful what you wish for; keep your friends close and your enemies closer; and many other time-honored cliches that stand true today.<br />For a good time, call Charles Dickens. His novels never fail to deliver.	2002-07-16

We cannot turn back the clock and fix the past; we cannot predict the future; all we can do is try to live the best and happiest life possible in the here and now.<br />While not an avid reader of non-fiction, and not overly enthused with supposed 'feel-good,' or 'self-help' books, this was neither.  In 'Ethics,' the Dalai Lama has written a fascinating, wonderful, enlightening read. It is neither 'preachy' nor demanding, rather a guiding light of sorts, a hint at how to more easily come by happiness on our own, that we have the power to make our lives of a better quality.<br />The Dalai Lama is not a healer. He does not possess mystical powers to 'fix' our lives. Neither is he a deity, although a Tibetan Monk living in exile. However, his words of peace and harmony, and a possible method for achieving those in our lives by simply 'using the present well' and 'doing unto others' is a source of inspiration and tranquility.<br />While occasionally naive in the belief of a deep down desire of all to live a life that is happy and free of suffering, the Dalai Lama's perspective is indeed refreshing. His takes on world events, war, religion, sex, and the daily lives of all people, regardless of race, creed, location, or religious faith, is amazing, perhaps attained in his world travel as a lecturer and provider of spiritual elightenment. <br />While never pressing the Buddhist belief and way of life, a simple view of it is offered. The suggestion is then made to adapt your own beliefs and values, and religious teachings, into a conscious effort to live your life to its fullest; to treat others around you with dignity and respect, thereby enriching your own life. <br />Touching upon all aspects of life, how we treat ourselves, how we treat others, and how we treat the earth itself, Ethics For the New Millennium is a wondeful read, and a treatise on happiness that I will draw from for my own peace and serenity for years to come.	2002-07-07
US	49931260	R34BXY4JUURZNZ	1568494858	71132903	The Etruscan	Books	4	32	32	N	N	Ancient Greece and Rome	Mika Waltari's The Etruscan is one of the better books about ancient civilization that I have read. Dividing it's time between Ancient Greece, and Ancient Rome, the book reveals the story of Lars Turms, who can remember nothing of his life before being 'delivered to the earth from a thunderbolt.' Turms travels from city to city, seeking a place to call home, and all the while turning his back on his destiny.<br />Bewitched by the Goddess of Eryx, Turms falls in love with the mortal form that the Goddess inhabits, and spirits her away from the city to make her his wife. But, her heart and soul being ruled by position and wealth, Arsinoe betrays him time and again, until Turms finds himself alone and wandering, again seeking his place in the world.<br />Wars are fought, cities are overtaken, friends come and go, and wealth is gained and lost as Turms moves from city to city. But no matter what misfortunes befall him, Turms simply moves from one circumstance to the next, taking is losses and griefs in stride, praising the Gods when some small token of good fortune comes his way.<br />It is in the last 100 pages of the book that Turms' destiny is revealed. Though a wonderful conclusion to the story, it seems a bit slighted in terms of development and description, when the rest of the book thrives upon both and delivers them in abundance. The bulk of the book moves along at a meandering pace, such as a person with no particular destination might, but picks up in terms of pacing and content at the end. And while the climax of the book is exciting, it might have benefited from a bit more development.<br />Some of the characters suffer from this underdevelopment as well, save for Arsinoe, whose treachery and passion kept her an engaging read throughout the book. The rest of the characters, no matter what role they play in the story, all seem secondary, and pale in comparison to the hero and heroine of the tale.<br />Although Rome has never really been a subject of historical interest for me, as closely tied to the history of Greece as it is, I did find the explanation of ancient time, setting, custom, and tradition an entertaining read.	2002-07-03

Bleak House, Charles Dickens' scathing look at the Victorian Legal system, is a wonderful portrait of people, ideas, and the power of fame and fortune to seduce even the most innocent.  A house was never less bleak than the one that Dickens has portrayed in this book.<br />The central thread of the novel, the suit being handled by Jarndyce and Jarndyce...involves a large inheritance. But the proceeds of such have been tangled up in legal jargon and shuffled papers for years, to the point where no one really knows what the basis of the suit is any longer. But year after year, lawyer after lawyer, the case progresses.<br />Enter Esther Summerson, a young girl, orphaned at an early age, and raised in the care of an eccentric woman, who upon her death, leaves Esther in the charge of one of the aforementioned Jarndyce men, to ensure her well-being.  She meets a myriad of other characters, some rich, some poor, all who influence her life in one way or another.  There are far too many to name without slighting any others, but suffice to say that Dickens had an amazing ability to characterize anyone, from the simple street sweeper to the height of London's elite social scene...and does so with a deep, probing eye, and a proclivity for realism.  Each character comes with unique traits and characteristics, and a wonderful story to tell. Although Dickens is often criticized for his loquacious writing style...the strength of his ability to bring characters to life is argument enough for the length of most of his works.  Dickens ability to satirize almost any element of Victorian society is a must-read for anyone with an interest in history, and I am continually fascinated by aspects of many of these settings that still hold true in the present day world. The effect that the promise of wealth has upon people, the attraction of fame for those who do not possess it, and the truth that lies in the notion that money cannot always buy happiness.<br />While Esther's life, and the lawsuit, are the main focal points of the novel, the rest of the various plots and subplots will engage and entertain. Dickens was truly a master novelist, and proof that classic literature endures for a reason.	2002-05-09

While it is a well written book, it ultimately was a bit disappointing.<br />Promising much at the outset, with the introduction of Herculine, a young woman being raised in a convent school in 19th Century France. Herculine befriends Peronette, the niece of the Reverend Mother. At once enraptured by the wild, reckless girl, it is her admiration of this decidedly secular girl that leads to the accusation that Herculine is possessed by the devil.  She is then 'imprisoned' while she awaits a decision from the town elders as to what to do with her. During this incarceration Herculine finds herself with access to books about spells and sorcery.  Her studies bring her face to face with two unquiet spirits, and her ultimate flight from the school, with some 'other-worldly' assistance. <br />Herculine is then thrust into the world of witchcraft, willingly, as she encounters Sebastiana, Asmodei, and the two 'elementals'; the dead priest Father Louis and his former lover Madeleine. All four figure in her 'escape' from the convent school, and her introduction to use of 'The Craft.' She is taken to the home of Sebastiana, in the French Countryside, and given safe haven from her accusors at the convent school as she learns more about herself, and receives confirmation that she is indeed a witch, and must embrace her destiny as such.<br />Either reading or hearing first-hand accounts of the lives and experiences of Sebastiana, Father Louis, and Madeleine, as well as limited amounts of the history of Asmodei, the story then veers off into biographical territory, and becomes less and less about Herculine, and more about secondary characters who really do not drive the plot. They are more filler than foundation, and ultimately disappear altogether from the story, as it reaches the climax and resolution.<br />I titled this review 'Like a Car Accident' for a purpose. Although quite dry in plotline, and a 'climax' that is sorely lacking in excitement, the book IS indeed well written. The details are lavish and plentiful of the French Countryside, the back-stories of the characters are well crafted and well detailed, but they simply do not drive the plot along at all.  Some scenes tended toward gore, and were a bit unsettling, but ultimately are well written enough that, like a car accident, you feel compelled to look.<br />I only hope that Reese will explore these characters again, and this was only a first encounter with Sebastiana, Asmodei, et al, and a subsequent novel will use them to greater purpose. Reese is a skilled writer, with a fertile imagination, and is quite adept at crafting a world for a reader to get lost in.	2002-05-06
US	49931260	R3JQE28JAFUTJN	0380818302	234867967	Daughter of Troy: A Magnificent Saga of Courage, Betrayal, Devotion, and Destiny	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Daughter of Where?	The title of this book is confusing, having read what lies underneath it.  The narrator of the story, Briseis, is a daughter of Lyrnessos, a city that lay to the south of Troy.  The rightful queen of that city by birth, Briseus begins her tale by telling it to another, and recounts first her rapturous affair as the slave of Achilles, then returning to her youth, and what led to her enslavement, and finally with the powerplay between Achilles and King Agamemnon.<br />I am a lover of historical fiction that deals with Ancient Greece. And while I have found better, this one is highly entertaining, as a retelling of the Iliad.  <br />Briseis from very early on is gifted with augury, the power to prophesy events from omens she witnesses. The fight of two eagles tells her of the coming battle in Lyrnessos which will lead to its downfall, and the death of her family.  Her brothers stand valiantly to defend their home, even as Briseis warns them of impending doom for them all.  As she grows from girl to young woman, her powers of insight grow, as well as her ability to attract and seduce men.  Sampling many of the 50 sons of Priam, she develops a liking for male flesh, and grows hungry for a hero of her own.  But as fate would have it, she is married to a a man she grows to hate, and prays for his early demise, as her visions have foretold, and the arrival of a hero.<br />Her prayers are answered in the form of Achilles, the great love of her life. After Lyrnessos is taken, Briseis is reduced from Queen to slave, a role she takes on willingly to share the bed of her beloved warrior hero.  Their passion grows, even as the battle of the city of Troy looms like a dark cloud over both their heads, where Briseis has foretold much death and destruction.  Briseis is then lost to Agamemnon, and becomes slave and lover to a man she despises, once again, wanting desperately to return to the arms of Achilles.<br />Many figures of classical history grace the pages of the text, Patroclus, the best friend and companion of Achilles, Cassandra, the visionary daughter of Agamemnon, Hector, the bravest and most favored of all sons of Priam, and many others.  It is a tale rich with Greek history and detail.  <br />But where the book falls short is the forays it takes into romance novel territory.  While not exactly a war-story fan, I found the endless recounts of Briseis's adventures with young men in the bed chambers to be a bit arduous after a while.  Man after man finds his way into the embrace of this girl, and the reader is given far more detail than is warranted or necessary in each. Here the author strays toward a bodice-ripper, and images of half-dressed Greek warriors with flowing hair and large bosomed maidens scantily clad in torn dresses fill the mind, which does not lend to the story at all.<br />Where the strengths lie are this: The author obviously did her research before writing the novel, as many recounts of the Trojan war are displayed here, with great homage paid to the tales of old. The recreation of daily life in Ancient Greece is fascinating, as well as the authors unwaivering attention paid to the impartiality of the Greeks with their bedmates, as far as gender is concerned, or even familial connection.  Sarah Franklin does not gloss over the desire that Briseis's warrior brothers have for young men, and makes it a secondary part of their nature, by saying \\"Take a boy for pleasure, but not for love.\\" Nor does she shy away from a confrontation between Briseis and a visiting Queen as she makes mention of the affair between the queen and her stepson...Briseis is a smart girl, who knows how to use all of her attributes to great advantage.<br />In taking these 'taboo' subjects by today's standards and making them seem all too ordinary with the Greeks, Sarah Franklin has created a far more realistic portrait of Ancient Greece than others who have strived to accomplish the same task.<br />Some of the language strays from what would appear to be authentic, certain phrases and colloquialisms used, but overall the book is genuine in its endeavor to recreate the time of the Trojan War in Greece.	2002-04-08

After reading Summer of Night, retroactively by the publication date, I could not wait to jump into another Dan Simmons novel, Children of the Night...<br />Much more a page-turning thriller than Summer was (although that by no means denotes 'better,' just different) this book catapults readers into the world of Romanian refugee children, who as we find, are 'farmed' at the local orphanages, which are bursting at the seams, as the private blood-bank for local vampires...now THERE'S a drive up teller you might want to avoid....<br />But Kate Neuman, a skilled hematologist and Father Mike O' Rourke (the adult incarnation of a Summer of Night character) change the face of Romania drastically when Kate adopts one of the children, 'Joshua,' whom Count Vlad Dracula has determined as successor to the blood soaked legacy he leaves behind, weary of it all, having been alive for centuries.<br />Kate and Mike are pursued to the States, where Kate brings her recently adopted son home to try and study his remarkable immune system, which requires blood transfusions every two weeks...and perhaps find a cure for cancer and aids in the process of saving his life. When Joshua is taken back to Romania by the Count's minions, Kate and Mike race frantically back to save him from the dark destiny the Count has prescribed for the boy.<br />A wonderful, tighty woven, thunderbolt of a story, Dan Simmons proved himself a major powerhouse of a new writer with this story.  Highly recommended to anyone who is a fan of the Vampire genre....	2002-03-21

Children vanish, a faceless soldier appears in a window, and from the mammoth old elementary school that has stood like a dark, evil sentinel for countless years in the town, voices call out, tempting the children to enter its dark halls and perhaps meet their doom.<br />The children are all typical characters that anyone who grew up in a similar small town will recognize...as brave as if they were immortal (weren't we all when we were young?) convinced that your best friends are gonna be there for life...and that together there is no danger you cannot face, no obstacle you cannot overcome. <br />Sweetly nostalgic in the midst of unimaginable horrors, Dan Simmons has created a classic of modern horror with Summer of Night. Having recently seen his latest release, which incorporates one of the children of this book later in life, I decided to revisit portions of Summer, and find the magic in its pages once again.<br />Well worth the read, and a perfect prequel to reading Children of the Night, Fires of Eden, and now A Winter Haunting, which all utilize characters from this book.<br />No wonder Stephen King is 'in awe of Dan Simmons'...reading this novel will show you why....	2002-03-21

About halfway through The Tommyknockers, I felt like I had been there, done that time and again with him. I was fed up.....<br />Jump forward, 11 years, to the publication of Bag of Bones. The dust jacket makes it look like typical King territory, but inside, there is a wonder to behold.<br />Mike Noonan, author, widower, and grief-stricken man leaves his home for the cabin he and his wife shared, Sara Laughs. There he is not only haunted by her memory, but seemingly by her voice as well. He laments that there is nowhere to escape the loss he feels, even here, and finds it impossible to resume his writing career, with deadlines looming, and his stockpile of 'backup' stories dwindling fast.<br />Mike is drawn into a local power-play courtesy of Max Devore, the town's resident wealthy control freak, against the mother of his three year-old granddaughter and the child herself. Mike instantly feels sympathetic and protective to them both, and finds himself biting off more than he thought in extending his friendship to them.<br />Suddenly, his ability to write returns, but the voices do not cease to come. And the more time Mike spends at Sara Laughs, the further he is drawn into the realm of ghosts there that extend far beyond that of his deceased wife.<br />Bag of Bones is not a horror novel. Do not read it expecting gremlins, ghouls, or gore...what made King famous in the first place. Do expect a tale of loss, despair, frustration, and chance to begin again after suffering a terrible loss. As I have stated in other King book reviews, the man writes best when he leaves behind the demons that lurk in shadows and under beds, and probes the demons that lie in peoples' minds instead.<br />This has to be my favorite of all Stephen King novels I have read, and was sufficient enough to make me take a look at some of his more recent, pre-Bones works, such as Rose Madder, and the Long Walk.  For anyone who felt asI did all those years ago, that you had read it all before, pick this book up and give King another shot to entertain you.	2002-03-21

The extent to which they do the one or the other is one of the chief things that differentiate men.\\"<br />Nekhlyudov, the protagonist of the novel, acted according to the influence of others, ten years prior to the setting of the novel. Scheduled to join the Russian army shortly, he believes himself entitled to a life of squander and debauchery, of loose morals, and even looser sense of responsibility, according to his pledge of his life to the cause of the army. If he is willing, and very likely, to die for his country, then the country owes him. Such was the sense of entitlement common in the mind of Russian men at the time. Following this belief, Nekhlyudov finds himself seducing young Katusha, and bedding her, on the eve of his departure. He abadons Katusha after succumbing to the lust he feels for her, and leaves her to whatever life brings, without a second thought.<br />Ten years later, Nekhlyudov has that second thought, when he and Katusha are reunited, on opposite sides of the law. Katusha stands accused of robbing and poisoning a 'client,' as her life has led her to prostitution. Nekhlyudov sits on the jury that will decide her fate. When a guilty verdict is returned, and Katusha is sentenced to hard labor in Siberia, Nekhlyudov experiences a life-changing sense of guilt in the situation, believing that if he had not given into his animal desires with this girl, she never would have experienced such a downward spiral in life, and now he must make this up to her, by whatever means necessary, even if it means abandoning his life of priviledge and following the girl to Siberia, and marrying her, to right the wrong he did to her all those years ago.<br />What follows is a journey of self-discovery for Nekhlyudov, as he learns some of life's most valuable lessons. (1) You can't ever go home again (2) Money cannot buy happiness, and (3) You cannot save someone unless they wish to be saved.<br />Nekhlyudov fails to see anything but the girl he knew so long ago, still the same Katusha, but in unfortunate circumstances. With romantically idealistic eyes, he watches her in the courtroom, not realizing that perhaps she has grown in the past ten years, and perhaps she has reason for entering into a life of prostitution. Katusha herself explains to him that men, above all else, want the pleasure of the flesh and look upon her favorably enough that she can provide them with this simple pleasure. She sees it as fortunate for her that she is possessed of the good looks and slim figure to invite their lustful looks, and if she can provide this service and make a living at it, why not? Not exactly what you would expect 'the girl next door' to think. <br />Sickened at the thought of Katusha having been led by him into such an existence, Nekhlyudov rejects the lifestyle of excess and grandeur that he leads, and becomes disgusted with his circle of contemporaries, and the lack of substance their lives entail. He embarks on a quest to be the savior of the unfortunate, taking details of convicts to the courts and begging them to reconsider the circumstances. He feels that, had all of these people had a better, more priviledged existance, perhaps they would have turned out very differently, and not have commited the crimes that put them in their present surroundings. Eventually, he realizes that everyone makes their own choices in life, rich or poor, and must accept the consequences of their actions.<br />Throughout his desire to avail himself of Katusha's forgiveness and redeem himself for his past transgressions, Nekhlyudov turns a deaf ear time and again, as she tells him that what has befallen her is her own doing, and not his responsibility, and to leave her to it, and get on with his own life. Desperate to turn her life around, and save Katusha, Nekhlyudov overlooks the fact that Katusha herself has accepted her plight, and feels that the sentence she has been given is deserved.<br />This is a wonderful read, never slow or plodding, occasionally becoming a grand commentary on the state of prisons in Russia in the late 1800's, as well as a vivid portrait of the lives of the lower classes, and a wonderful commentary on Communist beliefs in Russia at the end of the 19th century.<br />The book ends.....very justly. There is no grand-scale Hollywood ending for Tolstoy, at least not here. The feeling one might walk away with is that though things did not end the way you might hope for...they ended exactly as they should....This was my first foray into Tolstoy, and will not be my last. I highly recommend this novel to anyone interested in a glimpse into the mind and convictions of a brilliant author.	2002-03-20

It purported to be Walpole's 'masterpiece' according to the Daily Telegraph, and apparently was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction in 1919.<br />Set at the time of the Russian revolution (for clarity, the second one, not the first) I spent the entire 446 pages waiting for something, anything, to grab me as either a plot, or a central thread, or even a connection really as to what this book was about. <br />Divided into three sections, the book follows many lives intertwined by different arrivals in Petrograd, Russia, and a family already living there. There is vague mention of a 'monster sighting' beneath a frozen river....there is political intrigue...there is a love story...and there is the revolution. But sadly, none of these themes ever emerges victorious over the others in captivating a reader's interest, at least this reader, and by the end of the tale you are left wondering what you just read.<br />There are far better portraits of revolutionary Russia, pre-, during, and post-, written by native authors. I highly recommend their works over this one, as it never fully hit the mark, and having recently read my first Tolstoy, I was far more convinced of the landscape painted by him than I was by Walpole's. <br />Other novels by the same author sound intriguing, but this is, in my humble opinion, not one to get very excited about. His writing style is good, his characters are realistic, but his story overall left me quite flat, as I was never quite able to determine what it really was.	2002-03-20

Well, just shy of four feet, really.<br />The central character of this novel, Frank Bois, is a dwarf, 43 inches tall. The novel skips back and forth between Frank's childhood with his less than virtuous mother, Bernadette, and his 43rd year, where he is about to become a published author, having written a brilliant study of the night skies.<br />Frank, from earliest days, is made aware that he is different wherever he goes. Born with achondroplasia, he knows he will never reach full height of an average man. His mother, while never really shielding her 'different' son from the world and all it's avaialble cruelty when you are not 'average or better,' also never treats him as different, but in doing so never fully prepares him for the cruelties that are inflicted upon him as he struggles to fit into society, and make friends. She merely accepts her son for what he is...a trait that others cannot seem to employ in their treatment of him.<br />Bernadette flits from one man to another, never committing to any one of them, and leaving a trail of broken hearts behind her as she parts from the world, bearing a terrible secret with her in conjuction with another pregnancy.<br />Frank, from this point forward, wallows in despair that this is a world created for beauty and the beautiful, and the different and ugly will never find a place in it, and never find love, for who can look at something ugly and take it into their heart?  <br />While his lamentations are poetic, his despair heart-wrenching, and while the tale of Frank Bois touches that part of all of us that ever felt 'different' and unaccepted for that difference, the conclusion of the novel, grand and romantic as it is, left me cold, feeling a sort of 'When Harry Met Sally' let down, where the conclusion proves the entire point of the story wrong. <br />This is a wonderful, unique novel, and well worth the time to read it. But as I was left a little flat by the end, I can only rate it with four stars, for its ability to make an introspective person realize that different is not always bad, for its ability to point out that everyone has something to contribute to life, and for its ability to make you look at yourself, and realize aren't we all different, in some way, and isn't that one of the great joys of finding friends and lovers?<br />The Dork of Cork will hopefully touch anyone who reads it, and although I cannot give it the highest of praise, it touched me as well.	2002-03-20

But after days of searching, there really isn't one.<br />In Wicked, Gregory Maguire does for the Wicked Witch of the West what Anne Rice did for Vampires, namely the Vampire Lestat, when we got 'his side of the story,'  and discovered that perhaps he wasn't such a villain after all. The Witch, a character that held so much childhood fear and contempt for me becomes a pitiable, loveable, endearing creature....almost human.<br />With 288 reviews of this book,  I am sure you can find a synopsis that will satisfy any reader, and give you either too much, too little, or just enough detail. So, I won't bore with another rehash.....suffice to say that the book entertains from start to finish. Elphaba the Witch, Glinda the Good, Tik-tok the mechanical man, and even the Wizard himself, are all turned upside down in terms of character  definition, and a whole new Oz opens itself up to the reader, an Oz of political conflict, class struggle, dark deeds, adultery, prejudice, sin, and redemption. <br />In re-imagining the beloved tale of Oz, which has survived for so many years permanently embedded in the hearts and memories of children and adults around the world, Gregory Maguire surely ran the risk of a public outcry for taking such a story and re-tooling it, such as the 2001 re-telling of Planet of The Apes on the big screen. But, as he managed with Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, Maguire has taken this tale and made it completely his own. Proper homage is given to the fantasy-world of Oz that we all remember, and yet we discover layer upon layer that we never knew existed. Maguire explores the true nature of evil, whether evil itself is an entity which exists in the world, or if it is merely a judgement of the actions of human beings.<br />The book is chock full of imagery and foreshadowing, the course of Elphaba's (the Witch) life being determined within the first 100 pages of the book. It also explores the idea of predestiny, or whether or not the events of all of our lives are determined by a force other than our own will. <br />For anyone looking at this book, be warned, it is not a tale for children.  However, for adults, this is a highly original, well crafted, entertaining read.	2001-12-02

The result is disappointing.<br />In past Vampire Chronicles, Anne Rice has comfortably found the voice of Lestat, Louis, Armand, David Talbot, Pandora, and a host of others. With Marius, she never really seems to find his voice.<br />The first three hundred pages of this long-awaited novel are drivel. Marius, the strong, dedicated servant of Those Who Must be Kept, is nothing but a simpering, overly-analytical weakling. The book covers vast historical territory, but as has plagued the most recent Vampire Chronicles, at least in my opinion, it is all too underdeveloped. A sudden, all-consuming love of Botticelli is nothing more than a simple nocturnal visit to his workshop. The horrors of the destruction of Rome are glossed over.  Marius the watcher simply witnesses his beloved Italy destroyed, and merely moves on. So out of character of his past convictions.  He appears only a lovesick simpleton, moaning for Pandora, his lost love, wailing over the destruction of home after home by the ravages of fires set by a Satanic band of blood drinkers, and never appearing any stronger as a result of all this misfortune.<br />The story only finds its momentum when we reach the part of Marius's tale already chronicled in The Vampire Armand, when he rescues the young Amadeo, as he calls him, from a brothel and takes him in as apprentice and lover, finally giving him the Dark Gift of the Blood to prevent his mortal death and provide him an immortal eternity to share with Marius, which as we already know is not the course of events.<br />Following this, Marius fleshes out fully as a character. His love of Pandora is believable only in their inevitable reunion, his devotion to guarding the Divine Parents of the Vampires, so wishy-washy throughout the novel, becomes more palpable. The novel concludes with the Marius that I had come to understand from prior novels, yet the preceeding pages all seem to destroy that image.  <br />Most recently, Anne Rice has been criticized for losing focus of her characters from their original inception. I have found that while the characters have changed, it would seem a logical course of events as they live from century to century, and evolve just as we all do as human beings. However, the Marius here is not even a shadow of the Marius of prior works, and it seems as though Ms. Rice simply never found his voice to tell his tale. <br />For the strength of Marius throughout the past novels, and even though the last 150 pages are worth wading through the rest of the book to reach, this overall is a disappointment at best.	2001-10-22

Rarely, if ever, do books captivate me on such a level as this one, and even more rarely do I find such a strong connection between a fictional character and myself.  That is what I discovered in the pages of Song of the Lark.<br />In preparing to post this review, I saw the title of another, which I believe read Hideously Dull and Boring, or something to that effect.  This story, my first Willa Cather, was nothing of the sort.<br />Within the pages of this book a reader finds passion, love, art, beauty, despair, tragedy, disgust, longing, and triumph. Not bad for 9.95 in this day and age.<br />Thea Kronborg, the heroine of the story, is from very earliest meeting somewhat different from the rest of her family, and the other citizens of Moonstone, Colorado.  She is one of several children, but is seen as 'something different, something special' by Howard Archie, the town doctor. He becomes her confidant, her friend, and patron as Thea rises from midwestern girl to Metropolitan Opera headliner. <br />Through her training and triumph, Thea discovers what is sorely lacking in others in her profession....passion, committment, and integrity.  She bemoans the success of other singers, as merely 'crowd pleasing' rather that technically superior, or even correct. She rails at the off-pitch, lifeless tones of some of the more popular of her contemporaries, thinking them hideous and beastly, and severely lacking in talent.<br />Thea's life starts in a small Colorado town, where she experiences her first 'love', and her first tragedy when she loses that love. But as she grows, as a singer, and as a woman, Thea realizes, through a series of highs and lows, that her one true love is the pursuit of her passion, her singing. She sacrifices all for that passion, and never seems to regret it as she reaches her reward. <br />Although I admired many traits in this character, the one that stands out most to me is her disdain at others for accepting mediocrity in themselves. Thea despairs when others sell out for simple recognition, and accept it in lieu of striving for artistic integrity. As a performer, this quality in her touched me personally, from having shared stages with many performers stealing scences, upstaging, oversinging, all for personal gain, whether it befit their charater or not.  Integrity is a quality sorely lacking in so many these days, that to find another being, fictional or real, so disgusted with the lack of it, was truly a treat.<br />Willa Cather draws from her own childhood to illustrate life in a small midwestern town accurately, and makes liberal mention of many well-known operas in Thea's rise to fame. This is a perfect gem of a novel, with a very believable story of a woman's passion realized in her art.  There are no lucky breaks, no right place at the right time, Thea works for everything she gains, one of the greatest rewards of all.	2001-07-13

Michael Devlin, the hero of Pete Hamill's Snow in August is a typical, all-American boy of the 1940's.  He lives in an apartment with his mother in New York, his father having died in the second World War, reads Captain Marvel comics, plays stick-ball with his friends, and dreams of nothing more than the life he already leads. <br />ENOUGH with the atmosphere.<br />The greatest disappointment for me of this novel is that the author works overtime to paint the post-war scenery for the reader.  A mention of Bing Crosby on the radio is accompanied by a Who's Who of popular radio of 1947.  It gets a bit wearisome.  Although it does LEND to the story to set the time and place, the constant barrage of pop culture circa 1947 reads more like name dropping, or as if the author spent most of his research time reading lists and incorporated them in just that forum, a list.<br />That said, the story is a charming one. Michael Devlin, the story's hero and protagonist, is dared by his friends to go to the local Jewish synagogue to search for the 'hidden treasure' they are certain lies within.  Michael accepts the dare, and is suprised to find himself befriending the synagogue's Rabbi Hirsch, and losing interest in finding this so-called treasure. Michael slowly discovers that the real 'treasure' is the wealth of history and magic which the Rabbi, and the Jewish history, holds.  He studies Talmud, learns basic Yiddish, and even manages a substantial discount on a new suit with his recently acquired third language (English, Latin for Church, then Yiddish).<br />Conflict arises when Michael witnesses a brutal attack on a local merchant by a member of a street gang. Rather than be branded with 'the mark of the informer' (a knife cut from lips to ear lobes) Michael stays silent, except for with his mother and the Rabbi.  However, the silence catches up with him, as the identity of the attacker becomes known to the police, and Michael, his mother, and the Rabbi are targeted by the gangto be killed, as the gang is certain that Michael has been the one to give them up to the police.  <br />Mixing actual history with a far-fetched, unbelievable ending to resolve this conflict, the author does himself a major disservice by concluding the book in the manner which he chose. Hamill's natural storytelling charm and adept character development are mired in a fantastical conundrum which completely overshadows the rest of the story.	2001-07-09

Aimed at a juvenile demographic, they, in humor, cater to adults. Such was my delight in reading Gregory Maguire's novel, Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister.<br />Imagine trying to take the urban legend of the couple in the car that hear of an escaped maniac with a hook hand on the loose in the area, and drive away, only to find a bloody hook lodged in one of the door handles, and re-tell this story, told ad nauseum, in a completely original vein.  That is just what the author has accomplished with this book, given readers a completely original 'bloody hook,' in the form of Cinderella.<br />Maguire's Cinderella is a tale of beauty, of ugliness, of betrayal, of despair.  No longer is Cinderella the shy, misunderstood, but ever-so-beautiful young girl, put upon by an unmotivated stepmother. Cinderella, or Clara, as she is called in this tale, is headstrong, independent, fearful of the world, a disbeliever of its wonders, a subscriber to dark tales of imps and changelings. <br />The aforementioned Stepmother, Margarethe, flees England with her two ungainly, awkward daughters in tow. Iris and Ruth are submitted to the worst cruelty, the affirmation from their own mother that they are plain, ugly, and ultimately unprofitable to their mother, and a burden, as they cannot ever hope to marry.  Margarethe schemes and connives her way into a wealthy household, and into the Master's marriage bed following the death of Clara's mother in childbirth.<br />But all is still not as it seems. Clara, doused in beauty unparalleled in Holland, has no interest in the world, no concept of the power her beauty entitles her to. Margarethe, intent on protecting her interests in the guise of concern for her daughters, all but pimps Clara out, hoping to cash in on her looks, and therefore secure her own station, when it is put in jeopardy.<br />Although the story plays out according to the time-honored traditionof the Cinderella fable, there are many secrets to be revealed in this recounting of all-too-familiar lore.  This isn't your childhood bedtime Cinderella, nor is it the property of Disney any longer, this Cinderella belongs solely to the adept imagination of Gregory Maguire.  <br />Rich in the landscape of 17th-century Holland, dark in its revelations that 'extreme beauty is an affliction', and haunting in its study of the curse of plainness, Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister is a wonderful, original piece.	2001-06-06

It has moved from bookshelf to bookshelf as I have moved, and yet it has remained unread.  Now I know why.  <br />I had to give the book, and therefore the author, 2 stars. One for the fact that the story starts with an entertaining and intriguing premise, the protagonist waking one morning after an alcohol binge, with blood on the front seat of his car, a new tattoo on his arm, one hell of a hangover, and no real recollection of the events of the prior evening. A decapitated head buried at a secret marijuana patch complicates matters, as Madden has a vague recollection of spending time with a woman the night before who bears a striking resemblance, as does his recently decamped wife. Tim Madden is at once an engaging character, with lots of potential...but the book loses steam once the plot thickens, with far too many suspects and characters for so thin a book, and one gets bogged down.<br />The other star is for vocabulary. Either Mailor has a wonderful economy for words, or a good thesaurus. <br />I have put down books that I liked more than this one and never finished them. The only saving grace here was that my copy of this book only has 229 pages, and was not much of a chore to get through.  While I have heard raves about Norman Mailer for years, I cannot subscribe to that after this book.	2001-06-03

Walker takes Chris's breath away, touches his young soul, and breaks his heart. He promises to love Chris forever, and leaves him broken and devastated for years to come.<br />William Corlett, the author, accurately and poignantly describes the angst and anguish of Chris as he struggles through the loss of Walker, and the devastating realization that Walker's words of love and devotion were just that, words, nothing more.  <br />Speaking to relationships on so many levels, and the personal doubt and despair that is felt with the loss of love, this book is well crafted, and pulls all the right heart-strings.<br />Although there is closure for Chris at the end, that does seem a bit forced, and a bit 'cinematic' in its realization.<br />However, this is a very touching book, well written, easy to read, and tought-provoking in its honesty.	2001-05-19

At a time in my life when I was thirsty for gay culture, gay films, and especially gay novels, I encountered The Men From the Boys.  <br />While not my favorite gay-themed novel, it is one of the better ones that I have read.... . It is hard to find an average, every day gay novel to read at times, about an average, everyday gay man in average, everyday circumstances.<br />But while yearning for just such a find, in reading this novel, I found so many extraordinary features to gay life that perhaps had never dawned upon me before.  Jeff, the central character of the novel, is in his thirties, as I am now. And, true to the description the author applies to this time of life for gay men, he is 'gay middle-aged.'  It struck me as horribly realistic that the author would describe the character as such, middle-aged, amidst a youth-obsessed culture.  But, like it or not, it is the truth. And William Mann, the novelist, captures this in the pages of this book.<br />The story centers on the past and present relationship of Jeff and Lloyd, his lover of several years, as well as Javitz, a former lover, stricken with AIDS.  While at times I felt as though Javitz was thrown in as 'comic relief' to the severity of the novel in the disintegration of Jeff and Lloyd's relationship, feeling that there is no longer any passion left, Javitz is utterly recognizable in gay culture and society. Every city has a Javitz, the jaded, bitter, but unwaveringly, hysterically funny friend.  Javitz's AIDS affliction is not a major plot point, but very poingantly portrayed in the novel.<br />This book is about so many different things, it is hard to list them all. The obsession of gay men with youth and beauty, the horrors of AIDS, the fickle nature of gay relationships, and the lack of determination to work out problems when they arise, the bitter, vengeful nature of many gay men, and the occasional loneliness of gay life, just like any other lifestyle. Although not the best gay novel I have everread, this is one of my favorites.	2001-05-17

I detested it, swore I would never read Dickens again, only to find that my junior year held in store for me what would become one of my favorite novels, Great Expectations, a book heinously bastardized years later by a 'modernized' film adaptation, with Anne Bancroft being the only redeeming feature.<br />Through the years since high school, I have begun to read Dickens of my own free will, and have greatly enjoyed his works.<br />Nicholas Nickelby, one of my all time favorites, is a wonderful novel, typical Dickens, chock full of characters, plots, satire, and story. Nicholas and his immediate family are the 'black sheep' of the Nickelby name. Humble, gentle, and common in the eyes of their well-to-do relative, Uncle Ralph Nickelby, who denounces Nicholas as a boy, and man, who will never amount to anything. <br />In typical Dickens fashion, Nicholas encounters adversity first at a boarding school, then in society, as he forges a name for himself. Along the way he befriends many, enrages some, and invokes the wrath of his Uncle Ralph, determined to prove himself right in bemoaning the shortcomings of his nephew.<br />One point of interest in this novel for me is the major revelation that comes toward the end involving the character of Smike. Throughout the novel he is loveable, pitiable, and utterly realistic, and his significance to the life of Nicholas, as revealed in the final chapters, is a true plot twist, and a charming, if not bittersweet, realization.<br />For anyone forced to read Dickens early in life, if you appreciate quality satire and an engaging look at the London society of more than 125 years ago, visit this novel sometime, it is one of Dicken's finest.	2001-05-17
US	49931260	R11YKBLCCHEWSQ	0451196716	882393531	The Long Walk	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Not the best King book, but very enjoyable.	Writing under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, Stephen King released a collection of novellas some twenty years ago. The Long Walk, which did not receive the attention of The Running Man, translated onto the big screen, and Rage, which seems to have all but disappeared due to the tragic high-school shooting incidents of recent years, is one of them.<br />The Long Walk consists of a group of 100 applicants, chosen each year at random from all of the submissions, to participate in a 'Long Walk'.  The prize? Everything and anything you want for the rest of your life. The defeat? 'Buying your ticket' out of the walk means ending your life....as you are shot by accompanying soldiers, always mindful of your pace, as you cannot fall under four miles per hour, and always watchful for 'runners' who try to escape the walk as they wear out. The walkers are not allowed to stop, for anything, or they are issued warnings. After three strikes, you are out, permanently.   King delves into the minds of several of the walkers, the largest treatise being given to Ray Garrity, the book's central character. Friendships are formed, enemies are made, and battle lines are drawn as each of the boys on the walk eyes the prize waiting at an undetermined distance ahead of them. The only way to win the prize, is to outwalk, and therefore outlive, everyone else.<br />As in most King novels, the descriptions of sights and people in the State of Maine is entertaining, especially to a native, and his exploration of the human mind is continually captivating. One of the things I have most enjoyed about King's works is his honesty of thought with characters in jeopardy or pain. Although at times his words are bitter and hateful, somehow King always manages to deliver what 'real' people think in times of crisis. The boys actually wishing each other dead, though horrible to think about, reads as utter realism from anyone competing with others for their life.  How many times have you, the average person, competed against another person, and found yourself entertaining thoughts that you would never dare to put a voice to?  King goes that far, and as always, his brutal words paint his characters all the more realistic.<br />Although I don't rate this as the best King book I have ever read, it ranks with my favorites, Bag of Bones, Misery, and Rose Madder. Stephen King seems to write best, and most convincingly, when he walks away from horror, the genre that has made him the best selling author of his time.  His best 'demons' are the ones that lay within us all, in our own minds. Without the advent of major plot twists and turns, and a limited 'landscape' for the book, as the boys are continually on the road, and there is no shift to exotic locations, or dream states, or other worlds, this book does manage to hold attention to the last.	2001-05-09
US	49931260	R1ECMXDFLM5UFO	0671798561	628570269	Nevermore	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Distracting, but readable	...The pairing of Davy Crockett and Edgar Poe as sleuths in 1800's Baltimore trying to solve a string of murders is almost as fascinating as it is implausible.  The circumstances driving them together, Crockett's disdain over an infavorable review of his book by Poe, seems a bit contrived.<br />However, this starts off a series of murders in Baltimore, which Poe discovers are linked to his own lineage.  The occurance of these murders, conveniently coinciding with the arrival of Crockett in Baltimore, is the largest contrivance of all.  Although I am not an avid reader of Whodunits, I occaisonally do delve into them, and hate to find a work that explains the what, but not the why. The absolute absence of a coincidence cannot be overlooked. The motive, as the reader finds, is plausible, but the timing is greivously overlooked.  <br />Although the book is very readable, chapters of a very easily conquerable length, the dialogue can be at times distracting, with the contrast of Poe to Crockett. Poe's eloquent, well-bred dialect mixed with Crockett's simple, yarn-spinning speech keeps the reader bouncing back and forth, and is a bit unsettling at times.	2001-04-30

I was quite happy to see that it did.<br />The Odyssey offers a look into Ancient Greece, telling the tale of King Odysseus as he prepares for a journey home after years of absence. His Queen, Penelope, has been courted by suitors, who hope to win her hand, and her wealth, as she chooses one for remarriage. But Penelope stalls them for years, in the hopes that her long absent husband is not dead after all, and will one day return to her.<br />Guided by Pallas Athene, Odysseus braves many perils and foes to return to his home and family.  A cyclops, a visit to Hades where he is confronted by the souls of the dead, Scylla and Charybdis, who attempt to smash his ship to pieces against the rocky shores, and finally his own people, as Odysseus confronts the men who have disgraced him by attempting to win the hand of his wife, and have all but set up residence in his home.  Odysseus stands against all of this and triumphs, finding his son and wife still as devoted to him after a nineteen year absence as when he left them.<br />For any lovers of ancient Greece, the Odyssey is a must read.	2001-04-18

Rose teases Blair with tidbits of information regarding the life Maypole led in Wigan, as do many other of the town's inhabitants, leading Blair to believe there is a deeper meaning to his presence in Wigan than merely finding Maypole's whereabouts. <br />Deftly displaying Blair's aptitude in the workings of a coal mine, as well as his shortcomings as a detective, Martin Cruz Smith weaves an intriguing tale, as Blair encounters mystery after mystery leading him to brawls with local miners, roadblocks at every turn in his search, and brief physical liaisons with Rose before the answers to his question are found.	2001-03-06

Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, although written in the latter half of the 19th century, holds up well to the conversion from the original Russian to English.<br />Rodion Raskolikov is a student, an author, an intellectual. Like countless others in Russia at the time, he is also very poor. His empassioned mind imagines that a local woman, a pawnbroker is evil, a parasite, for taking the valued trinkets of her neighbors and paying them a pittance in return, and for holding promisary notes over their heads. His rage turns to murder, justifying his actions later on as doing a greater good for many by taking the life of this one person. However, his crime is two-fold, as he is discovered by the woman's sister, still with the murder weapon in his hands, and in a moment of terrified frenzy, murders her as well.<br />The bulk of this novel, exquisitly written, is the slow realization of Raskolnikov that his crime was just that, a crime, no matter how good his intent.  Raskolnikov struggles with the guilt of his actions, even as he time and again proves his worthiness as a person in his actions regarding others, giving up his last bit of money to help another less fortunate than himself, attending to a dying man in the streets, trying to secure a good future for his sister, with a worthy man. Raskolnikov, as the reader discovers, is a good and decent man.<br />The underlying message of this book seems to be that even a man of conscience cannot commit an unconscienable act without repurcussion, without 'punishment', and that no matter how justified you think you may be in your actions, no matter how many good deeds you may do, with conscience there is always a higher authority to answer to, that of your own mind, and what you can or cannot live with.<br />Dostoevsky had been described to me as dry, turgid reading. I found it to be nothing of the sort. The story never drags on or belabours a point without logic and qualification. The characters, although the focus of the story is Raskolnikov, are all well realized, and developed.<br />The story itself remains interesting and engaging throughout every page, with a well crafted conundrum once you reach the epilogue, and leaves the reader, at least this one, with a desire to read more about this man, beyond the final words of the book.	2001-02-13

This is the only way I can begin to describe this book. Incident at Twenty Mile is the first story set in the old west that I have ever read. While not a fan of the Western genre, Trevanian blends the right mixture of action-infused thriller with the charm of the old west. <br />Characters galore grace the pages of this book, and even the most minute of them jumps off the pages and onto the canvas of imagination.<br />A dying mining town witnesses the arrival of a 'natural born con' named Matthew, and the story sets in motion, as Matthew ingratiates himself into the townspeoples' lives and employment. The town finds itself under seige by an escaped criminal, and Matthew reluctantly becomes the hero he always imagined himself while reading the pages of his favorite writer and trying to invoke the style and ideals of his favorite character, The Ringo Kid. <br />The book has many sad moments, as the criminal, Lieder, claims a number of victims, before justice is served. The story, setting, and characters are all very well developed and realized.<br />I read the last half of this book in one sitting, finding myself unable to put it down, even as the hours ticked by. This is a very entertaining read, highly recommended.	2001-02-06

Doctorow that I have ever taken the time to read, and I hope not indicative of his storytelling.<br />The book is chock full of possibility, but never really delivers. The title, first and foremost, is a confusing choice, as 'the waterworks' only appears in the latter portion of the book as a setting, and a part of the story.  <br />Doctorow captures some of the elements of life in post-Civil War New York, and has a wonderful basis of story, but never fully delivers on any of it. Every character, every plotline, every twist and turn seem secondary, as if there is some huge payoff waiting to happen, which never arrives.  This story screams for further development.<br />The narrator, McIlvane, tells the tail of his friend and colleague, Martin Pemberton, who is convinced of the sighting of his 'dead' father, Augustus, a wealthy, wretched man who left his wife and other son behind to be taken away to die by a doctor. McIlvane then finds Martin among the missing, and follows a trail of grave-digging, murder, and disappearing children to Martin, and to the force behind all of this, a Doctor Sartorius. <br />Again, the story has a lot of potential, but it is never realized. All of the plot elements are left unexplained, save for a blurb from Sartorius at the end trying to explain his actions and the reason behind them, but even that leaves a lot to be desired.<br />Overall this was a bit of a disappointment.	2001-01-26

It does, however, follow a strikingly familiar formula, as do many of the &quot;strong heroine&quot; novels of the nineteenth century.<br />Jane Eyre is a girl orphaned at a young age. She endures a very Dickensian treatment at the all-girls orphanage she is relegated to by her less than sympathetic relations, after being branded a trouble-maker, and having a bad character, and a deceitful dispostion.<br />She survives the orphanage, only to be enlisted in the employ of a Mr. Rochester, as tutor and nanny to his charge, Adela. She is at once intrigued, if not a bit repelled by his brusque nature, and yet finds herself falling in love with him.<br />Jane is caught up in the mystery of the 'tenant' on the third floor, a dangerous, diabolical person who places Jane's life, as well as Rochester's, in jeopardy, as Jane goes about her duties, all the while growing more and more amorous of Rochester.<br />Eventually the identity of the 'tenant' is revealed, and Jane must chose between love and sense of duty. Being the forthright person that she is, she of course chooses duty, much to the heartbreak of both herself and Rochester, who has grown as enamored of this plain, headstrong creature as she has of him.<br />Jane Eyre plays out in a very formulaic manner, much like many novels of the same ilk, but it is a wonderful read.  The characters are engaging and entertaining. The story holds a few twists and turns, and delivers a very well-realized conclusion.<br />For anyone who had this book thrust upon them in their teens, give it another try. For those who did not, it is well worth a first look.	2001-01-15
US	49931260	RH74A6966KHYC	0156167689	304326284	The Charioteer	Books	5	19	20	N	N	A departure	I read this book before ever indulging in Mary Renault's ancient Greek fiction, although this story is every bit as entertaining, even set in World War II.<br />The two main characters, Laurie and Ralph, struggle with their love for one another as well as their devotion and dedication to their relationship, and their friendship as well.<br />This book is every bit as timeless as the ancient Greece novels, yet a bit dated of a read amidst modern day views and sensibilities about homosexual relationships. It does, however, send readers back to a time where more value was placed upon the root of a relationship and of love. It transcends the need for graphic sexual display, yet does not hide the nature of the involvement between the two men.<br />Of all the homosexual themed novels I have read, this is far and away my favorite. Even though it was written over forty years ago, it stands the test of time in its message of understanding the value of love, regardless of gender.	2001-01-15

I rarely read non-fiction, but Midnight is so well written and developed, it rates with some of the best crime-stories and thrillers on the market today.<br />About the film, there are only two good things that I have to say. Kevin Spacey is a brilliant actor, and the soundtrack was wonderful. As for the rest of it.....<br />About the book-there are too many good things to say to fit them all here.  John Berendt's characters are all so well realized, and so engaging that they leap off the pages, and into your mind. Perhaps what gives them all such a tri-dimensional nature is the fact that they are real.<br />From Jim Williams, &quot;eyes so black they were like the tinted windows of a sleek limousine&quot; to the &quot;Lady of Six Thousand Songs&quot; to widely entertaining Lady Chablis, there is not a character in this book you cannot develop a picture of in your mind.<br />Having visited Savannah after reading this book, the setting is just as well displayed as if Berendt had taken a snapshot of the entire town and included it with each copy of his story.<br />A murder rings out one night, rocking Savannah society, and thrusting Jim Williams, and his lifestyle, into the spotlight. Once the envy of every social-climber in town, and the sender of the year's most coveted party invitations, Williams becomes a common criminal and fodder for gossip. His once emulated social standing withers away, as well as his business and wealth.<br />Berendt follows Williams through each of his subsequent trials and appeals, and tells Williams' story in great detail, so agonizingly overlooked by Clint Eastwood's film, where an eight year legal process was condensed into perhaps a few months time passage.<br />This is one of my favorite 'recent' publications, and an excellent and entertaining read for fiction and non-fiction lovers alike.	2001-01-15
US	49931260	R27QD25RY7NQI9	0380730405	39495389	Rebecca	Books	5	24	26	N	N	Truly A Classic	This book was recommended to me several times before I broke down and read it. I am a lover of classic films, yet this is one that I had never seen, for some unknown reason.  A good friend suggested that I read the book to truly enjoy the story to its fullest. And boy, was she right.<br />Although not my usual genre of choice, this is a true classic. The main character, the 'second Mrs. Dewinter' is a simple girl, swept up in a romance with a rich widower while she is on vacation as companion to a pushy, well to do woman. She leaves her employer to marry Max DeWinter, not anticipating all this union entails for her.<br />She is drawn into the shadow of Rebecca, the first Mrs. DeWinter, and fights to measure up, and to retain her sanity in Max and Rebecca's home, Manderley.<br />Not helping matters at all is Mrs. Danvers, a maid of sorts, who was utterly devoted to Rebecca, and bitterly resents the appearance of this plain, uneducated, unrefined girl trying desperately to fill the void left in the house when Rebecca died suddenly, under mysterious circumstances.<br />The second Mrs. DeWinter, never referred to by name, finds herself fighting to find her own place at Manderley, and in Max's heart, as well as seeking the approval of Mrs. Danvers and the other household servants, and Rebecca's friends and relatives, as she slowly comes to the realization that not all was as it seemed with Max and Rebecca, and the grounds of Manderley are the burial place of many secrets, perhaps better left undisturbed.<br />This is a wonderful story, full of colorful and engaging characters, and one of the best of the more 'modern' classics in 1900's literature.	2001-01-11

He should, considering that he holds a degree in history.  But many people can study history, and learn what the books teach. Few can re-create it with such accuracy. <br />From the first chapter of The Alienst, a rare and wonderful treat to find on the best-seller list amidst the legal thrillers, medical thrillers, and romance novels, you can feel, smell, almost touch the streets of late 1800's New York. Many of the small details matter so much here, and Carr has not spared any of them. The gas-lamps, the horse-drawn carriages, all of it is displayed with a non-chalance that lends to realism, even a hundred years in the future.<br />This book is not only a first-rate detective story, it reminds us of our humble crime-solving beginnings, amidst the high-tech methods of today.  With the absence of lap-tops, fax machines, and databases, you come to realize that police work long ago depended on actual brain power and leg-work, something that is taken for granted these days.<br />The Alienist also uses an historical figure, Theodore Roosevelt, as a character integral to the story, as he has only recently been appointed police commissioner.  His appearance in the story also accentuates the great pains the author took to paint a highly realistic portrait of life in New York at that time.<br />This is a fast past, engrossing thriller, enjoyable from start to finish, and very satisfying in its resolution.  It ranks highly among the modern thriller-genre releases, and is just as engaging, even set a hundred years in the past.<br />Caleb Carr deserves every day this book spent on the best-seller list, as well as a reservation to it for many years to come with future novels.	2001-01-10

Although 'Angel' follows a different format, where you know the identity of the quarry, even as she is pursued the Alienst, et al, the chase is just as exciting as in the prior novel, where the identity of the killer was a mystery.<br />'Angel' is also told by a different narrator, Stevie Taggert, who appears in Alienist as well.  This story follows the same characters from the first book, as they seek to bring a kidnapper to justice, as they explore her past, her nature, and her mind, in trying to determine what has led her to committing such an act.  While not a villain of the same nature as in the Alienist, Libby Hatch is just as diabolical, if not more so, and far more dangerous. <br />The Angel of Darkness is just as breathtaking as The Alienist in the recreation of turn of the century New York, and just as accurate in detail.  All of the elements of the first book are in place here as well, including the use of a real person as a character, this time famed attorney Clarence Darrow, who is the counsel for the defense.<br />Part detective story, part court-room drama, part love story, all history lesson, The Angel of Darkness is sure to keep your mind as busy as your fingers are in turning the pages to see what happens next.	2001-01-10

I had not read any Stephen King in years, not since The Tommyknockers was released. I think I managed to wade through half of that book, and then could stand no more of the same stuff he had churned out for years. But, what a difference a day, or in this case several years, makes.<br />I read this immediately following Bag of Bones, the best Stephen King I have ever read. After racing through that, Rose Madder was recommended to me, as being another King book that offered something different. Demons of a different kind. Demons of the past, but demons that were just as real as the creatures of his prior novels.<br />Rose, the novel's central character, extricates herself from an abusive marriage, and leaves her life behind to start over when she has finally had enough of her husband, Norman. Suffering physical and emotional torture for years, she finally summons the courage to run. Norman isn't quite so eager to split, though, not until he 'punishes' Rose for daring to mistreat him so.<br />Starting over in a new town, with a new life, and finding new life in herself, Rose sinks into a false security of relative anonymity. She finds an old painting in a junk shop, of a woman in a 'red' dress, which seems to call to her to buy it for her new apartment. The painting continues to haunt and mesmerize her, and eventually becomes her salvation, for just when she thinks she has escaped her former life, found a new career, and perhaps a new love, the demons of her past come back to haunt her, in the form of Norman, bent on making her pay for her 'crimes' against him. <br />This book blends just the right amount of fantasy with reality as the story builds to a rather climactic finish, as hunter becomes hunted, predator becomes prey. <br />This is one of the strongest King novels I can ever recall reading, and proof that his writing gets better with time. In Rose Madder, he takes a very different turn and explores real humans and their emotions just as vividly as his horrific creatures have been.  I recommend this book to King fans and non-King fans alike.	2001-01-10
US	49931260	R2VN3K5B11S1XM	0345423615	279350331	The Silver Wolf (Legends of the Wolves, Book 1)	Books	2	5	8	N	N	Overall a disappointment	I bought this book with very high hopes, since the author is not afraid to tout the benefits of being sister to Anne Rice, one of my favorite writers.  I have not read Alice Borchardt's other books, and have to say that after reading The Silver Wolf, would hesitate to do so.<br />Although the book is set in ancient Rome, I found myself unable to get lost in the time period as I do with Anne Rice, as many of the thoughts and ideals, as well as dialogue, seemed far too contemporary to appear realistic.  The vague connection to Charlemagne seemed more like name-dropping than a point of interest, and the villains of the story seemed more like characatures than characters.<br />The story is interesting, about a female werewolf, a shape-shifter, and the struggle she faces with her human and wolf co-existence. However, it would probably have fared better set in modern times, as the detail of ancient Rome seemed half-realized at best.<br />Since reading this book, there has been a sequel released, Night of the Wolf, centering on the love interest of Regeane, the main character of Silver Wolf, that apparently goes farther back in the history of Rome for its story. I sincerely hope Ms. Borchardt was better able to capture this lush and picturesque historical period with her second foray into it.<br />For anyone more interested in a good wolf story than in authenticity of time period, this would make a good read. But for myself, a true lover of world history and ancient civilizations,  this left me a bit flat.	2001-01-10
US	49931260	R1W0HO5YXHGHV2	0394716531	446299605	The Last of the Wine	Books	5	83	86	N	N	A Rare Treat	&quot;When I was a young boy, if I was sick or in trouble, or had been beaten at school, I used to remember that on the day I was born my father had wanted to kill me.&quot;<br />This is the opening line of The Last of the Wine. I anticipated finding a weak, sickly protagonist, plagued by misfortune. This was not the case. I found a man who lived his life in dignity, honor, and devotion, even with such a humbling beginning to his life.<br />Alexias, the narrator and protagonist of this story, matures and grows to manhood during the Peloponnesian War, in its final days. Alexias reaches young adulthood without the benefit of a father for many years, believing him to be dead, and takes over as head of the family, caring for his stepmother and sister, defending his honor, and the honor of his father, as others try to corrupt him.  He is fair of looks, posessed of good health, and strives to better himself, body and mind, throughout the book.<br />He meets and falls in love with Lysis, another Athenian boy, and the two form a life-long bond of friendship and devotion to one another, which extends to Alexias compromising himself to rescue the virtue and honor of Thalia, the bride of Lysis, when famine comes to Athens.  <br />I think one of my favorite aspects of Mary Renault's novels is her treatment of homosexual subject matter is not only extraordinary for the time her books were written, but also reads as though the sexual nature of the friendships, especially the one between Lysis and Alexias, is secondary to the genuine love and caring they feel for one another. Mary Renault's gentle treatment of, at the time, such taboo subject matter, never comes across as censored, or stifled, in any way.<br />This book is about many things; friendship, honor, principle, love, committment, and sense of duty. Of all the Mary Renault books I have now read, I find this to be the most complete telling of the life of a man in ancient Greece. The reader travels with Alexias, from his formative years as a boy, through his training as a soldier, his belief that as head of his family he must provide and care for them, his stepping down from that role when his 'not so dead as he thought' father returns to Athens, his struggle with complying with his father's wishes, while trying to retain the values and beliefs he has instilled in himself during his father's absence, and so much more. We see him risk his life to fight alongside Lysis to see Athens freed, not only because he knew it to be the right thing for himself and the people, but because Lysis believed in it, and his love for Lysis was enough for him to support the cause, even if it meant his own death.<br />I dare to say that I will never find another author so in love with this time period that they can re-create it with such beauty and passion. I hope that other readers will enjoy all of Mary Renault's books as much as I have.	2001-01-08
US	49931260	R2FCQCQAFG2IVT	0375401598	140729396	Pandora	Books	4	15	15	N	N	A New Beginning	I remember the feeling I had seeing an advertisement for this book prior to the release date. It was pure excitement. I had just finished reading 'Violin' and 'Servant of the Bones', and was hungry for more Anne Rice. <br />Pandora came along, and although I was a bit disappointed at first to see that it was a 'smaller' novel, in reading it I found much more content that I had anticipated.  <br />Pandora's tale, as told in journal form to David Talbot, the self-appointed 'chronicler' of the vampires, is far more romantic than Anne Rice's prior vampire works.  Pandora's childhood infatuation with Marius, which grows into genuine love as Pandora becomes a young woman, is every bit as heartfelt as Armand's infatution with Marius in the following vampire chronicle, The Vampire Armand. <br />The historical realization of this novel, set in ancient Rome and Antioch, is a departure of sorts from the other vampire tales. While the novels based upon the tale of Lestat tend toward a more religious exploration, this 'new tale' reveals more of Marius, and entices Anne Rice fans to want more of him.  Pandora receives the 'dark gift' from Marius, after an attack from another vampire, who seeks to kill Pandora as revenge on Marius, for keeping the King and Queen of the vampires hidden away from him. Through 'Pandora' it is clear that Marius is a force to be reckoned with, and hopefully the stage is set for a future novel of his own. <br />Although this novel is Pandora's tale, so much of it is wrapped up in the tale of Marius that it is easy to lose the focus. However, Pandora is a strong heroine for Anne Rice, developed from an 'in passing' character from Queen of the Damned, and a very entertaining read.	2001-01-02

Now, I cannot imagine not having read it. <br />It has a rather slow start, the trek to the mountains of Jonathan, the 'narrator' of the story, following a highly publicized murder. Jonathan nearly dies, but is rescued by Azriel, who has sought him out to deliver his history as 'Servant of the Bones'.  Azriel's tale is the key to the murder, and he wishes to divulge this information to a worthy recipient.  <br />The tale itself is one of Anne Rice's most fascinating yet. Azriel, a youth of Babylon, is chosen to be presented as an icon to his city. One catch, you must be painted in gold and die before you reach deity status.  Azriel at first welcomes the chance to serve his Hebrew God, even though it means he must die to do so, but ultimately realizes the intent of this station is to do whatever evil bidding his master proclaims. <br />Through the centuries he grows in power and wisdom, and overcomes the wrongdoing he is subjected to. In delivering his tale to Jonathan, and providing answers to the murder of Esther Belkin, Azriel hopes at last to redeem his soul for all of his 'crimes', by implicating his most dastardly 'master' in the plot he has conceived to take over the world in the present day.<br />Although not as rich in history or as self-effacing as Rice's other protagonists, Azriel is an exciting character, and his story is wonderfully told in the pages of this book. The ending is timely, touching upon world terrorism in the mid 1990's, although a bit 'Hollywood' and commercial. However, this is one of Anne Rice's stronger recent works, and a very good read.	2001-01-02

HUH?<br />Book one of the 'New tales of the Vampires', Pandora, seemed to explore the very idea of what the books were to be, the desire of David Talbot to chronicle the tales of other vampires. But in the opening pages of this book Vittorio himself states that he has nothing to do with the coven of the articulate, and knows nothing of their world and their existance. Ok, then where the heck did he get the notion to write his tale? <br />Anne Rice describes this as her &quot;Vampire Romeo and Juliet.&quot; Again, HUH? Romeo and Juliet is about a boy and girl, star-crossed lovers torn apart by the feuding of their respective families. Vittorio and Ursula are about as star-crossed as a cloudy sky at night. Ursula is a member of a band of vampires that slaughters Vittorio's family. She takes pity on him, for some unknown reason that the reader is supposed to assume is 'love at first sight' and eventually makes him a vampire. He seeks to liberate her from the other vampires, also a befuddling 'act of love', and fights anyone who stands in his way. Once more, HUH?<br />This is a very confusing book, and seemed to stray completely from the original concept of the 'New Tales'.  Although I do love the creation of ancient worlds that Anne Rice can accomplish, I found this book to be, overall, a disappointment.	2001-01-02
US	49931260	R60WZF95U579A	0679454470	464589829	The Vampire Armand : The Vampire Chronicles (Rice, Anne, Vampire Chronicles)	Books	5	4	5	N	N	The Vampire Armand	Although I was initially sad to see Anne Rice stray from Lestat as hero of her Vampire Chronicles, and take a new direction with Armand, I was more than satisfied with the outcome.  Armand appears as little more than an anti-hero in previous novels, and yet I was horrified to have him killed off in Memnoch, while never having been fully explored as a character. The blurb at the end of Pandora, revealing Armand as the subject of the next 'chronicle' was very enticing. And the book delivers.<br />Armand the mortal never reaches adulthood before receiving the 'dark gift' as it is described. He is sold into slavery as a youth, placed in a brothel and ravaged, and is bought by the mysterious Marius, who seems to wish him to be more of a 'companion' than servant or lover. Marius keeps the truth of his vampiric existance from Armand for some time, until Armand discovers Marius' secret, and all but begs to be made a vampire, to remain with his 'master' eternally, only to be taken from him by force, and begins to wander the world as one of the undead.<br />Anne Rice delivers all the wonder and uncertainty of boyhood, even in a world that existed hundreds of years ago, and portrays just the right mixture of indignance and angst with Armand, and he emerges as a sympathetic, angelic, romantic being.  He is a seeker of beauty, in art, in music, in people, in life, as much as Lestat is a seeker of salvation and redemption from his bloodlust. While Lestat seems to long for absolution for his soul from the crime of blood-drinking, Armand seems in search of his soul, never having understood it in his mortal youth.<br />Although it is a far cry from the sense I got of Armand in the preceeding novels, having never fully explored him as a character before, Anne Rice produced another hero whom I hope she revisits in novels to come.  This is a book I will read again some day, and look forward to doing so.	2001-01-02

I buy them the day they are released, and devour them immediately. But.....is it really worth publishing two per year, as the intent has been, to tell such undeveloped stories?  <br />Merrick is the latest edition to the Vampire Novels already lined up on my bookshelves. I love the stories. But to weave so many plotlines into this book, and not develop them, or explore them, when the book ends with July, 99 as a finish date for this story? Over a year ago, and it is scarecely 300 pages long? Where are the glorious Anne Rice novels of old, Cry to Heaven, the Witching Hour, the Vampire Lestat. And it is not even a question of quantity versus quality, the ideas are wonderful, the developement is just not there any longer.  <br />Merrick is Anne Rice's strongest heroine to date, definitely. I hope future novels will feature her again. This story is really wonderful, just not what it could be. And did anyone else notice on page 145 she refers to Matthew as Michael? Am I just a picky virgo???  Rice fans will love this, it is really good work, and worth the read.  But please Anne-tell your publishers to pound sand, take a year, and write something up to what you used to give us, I miss it.	2000-10-20

Last of the Wine, and elusive hardback find, and The King Must Die.  I looked forward to this, the Praise Singer, with great anticipation, thinking that, being a part time singer, perhaps it would appeal to me as much as The Mask of Apollo appealed to me as an actor.  However, this was not the case.<br />Although I greatly enjoyed the creation of the world of the Praise Singer, Simonides, I found this story lacking in real substance, like her other works. Although its own, autonomous work, unlike the Alexander Trilogy, and the two novels of Theseus, it lacked in the full scope of a man's life and work that Mask of Apollo had in abundance.  Simonides was without a doubt a graceful, elegant man, despite his self-declared 'ugliness', he showed inner beauty, and overcame the people's perception of what is beautiful, enticing them to look deeper into a person than what is visible on the surface. <br />Although this novel I found to be very limited, it still was an enjoyable read.	2000-09-26

With Funeral Games, she made a major departure, in  telling many stories at one time, all relating to the power struggle  following the death of Alexander the Great.  Reading this story at times  saddened me, in the respect that Alexander, albeit through war and  conflict, tried to bring unity to Greece, to bring his beloved country  'together'.  To watch those that surrounded him break off into such  discord, mutiny, and chaos as they all tried to succeed him in ruling  Greece seemed to put the work of his adult life to waste as he was laid to  rest.  <br />As the conundrum to the Alexander trilogy, this book was indeed  violent, yet a fitting conclusion to Alexander's story, although it was a  part he did not partake in directly. The many characters this story weaves  around are all very interesting, no matter how minor, and all play their  respective roles. The author took the time to research each one to portray  them accurately, and kept all of the stories engrossing throughout. <br />Once  again, her portrayal of Ancient Greece is like no other in fascination and  accuracy. I urge anyone who has invested the time in the first two books of  this trilogy to indulge themselves in this one as well.  Although it may  surprise you with its darkness and violence, it will not disappoint.	2000-08-14

Once it was realized, and the action set in motion, it was much  more enjoyable reading through to the end.  Unlike the Alexander novels,  the scope of reign that Theseus had in Greece was much smaller, therefore  the history is much easier to realize. His involvement with Hippolyta and  their subsequent love seems a little forced, too much so to be described as  the love of his life.  The fear of rivalry between Phaedra and Hippolyta,  and later with their respective sons, Akamas and Hippolytos, and Phaedra's  betrayal of Theseus is much tighther, cleaner, and more enjoyable reading.  The climax of the book is very exciting, and makes the meandering pace of  the first half seem worthwhile to plod through.  Overall, like her other  novels of ancient Greece, this offers an excellent and well realized look  at a culture that existed thousands of years ago.	2000-07-25

But with The Persian Boy, as told through the eyes of Bagoas, a  slave boy who becomes confidant, advisor, and lover to Alexander, she  humanizes this historical figure even further, and gives him attributes  that the history books neglect, those of a man.  She probes his mind, as  witnessed by the eyes of adoring Bagoas, who first reveres Alexander as his  master, and then dotes upon him as lover. Bagoas remains faithful to   Alexander through months of separation during the conquest of Greece, and  stands by his side despite treacherous efforts to discredit and dethrone  his King, through Alexander's 'relationship' with his boyhood companion  Hephaistion, and his 'marriage of convenience' to Roxane.    <br />This novel,  while it appealed to me on a romantic level, also exemplifies the nature of  love, be it between man and woman, or man and man, as a fevered, passionate  longing for another, a sense of loyalty to them and to your relationship  with them, during hard months of separation, and a desire to do anything to  please and/or comfort them.  However, the book also accurately recreates  Alexander's journey of seige across Greece, and the hardships he and his  followers endured.  Readers would be hard pressed to find a more  descriptive and honest look at Alexander the Great as a flesh and blood  creature, and not just the conquering hero of many bloody battles which  history books offer us.	2000-06-20

As a part-time actor, I thoroughly enjoyed reading the similar traits of actors and  practices in ancient Greece that still exist today.  Although production  methods are very different, personalities and &quot;egos&quot; seem to  remain the same.  I found plenty of smiles on my face as I devoured this  rich, lush novel.  A must read for actors, historians, and lovers of good  fiction	2000-03-18

Non stop action, clever twists, and a very satisfying climax.  But since  then,......This book I would hope is the culmination of a few bad years for  Grisham.  Unlike his meaty adventures of the past, this reads like a cheap  movie of the week pitch that got passed over by CBS. The idea is ok, the  persecution of closeted gay men is appalling, no matter how malignant he  makes the judges appear, and there is just no redemption to them, or the  book.  No one really pays for their crimes except for the victims of the  Brethren's blackmail scheme.  This took me all of 7 hours to read, really,  and I consider it a crime that it is on the bestseller list, when so much  quality fiction is out there.  Why did I buy it?  I needed a book for a  weekend read.  That is all.  And I was seduced by the hype.  Too bad, but a  valuable lesson, want more for yourself, want better, do not settle for  Grisham.	2000-03-07
