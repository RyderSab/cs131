Words can not express how much I enjoyed the \\"Jaylin Saga\\" from book #1 \\"Two's Enough Three's a Crowd, Book #2 \\"My Way or No Way\\" and last but not least \\"book #3 \\"Change Don't Always Come\\".  I would like to compliment \\"Brenda Hampton\\" on her exceptional writing skills.  Ms. Hampton is an author who knows how to captures ones attention and secure it until the very end AND THEN, make you yearn for more...I also applaud Brenda for having a vision to create #3 paperback books about the same group of characters and continue to keep your interest in their lives to a point of no return. That alone is phenomenal!  I was extremely satisfied with the ending of the \\"Jaylin\\" saga (book #3) with him and Nokea getting married.  I was also proud of Nokea coming to Jaylin after Nanny B contacted her and Nokea realizing she loved Collin's but was IN LOVE with Jaylin...Touche~   As for Scorpio, well, you win some, you loose some, however, I would have liked to find out what happened to Stephon, Jaylin's cousin and how he made out....Nanny B is in a class of her own....Thank God she was always there for Jaylin and able to care for him and offer sound advice.  Overall, this was an excellent book with an exceptional and satisfying closing which brings closure to a magnificent saga.  Thank You Ms. Brenda for a rewarding journey in the world of Mr. Jaylin Jerome Rogers!!	2005-06-03

Again, Connie has delivered a great story line which is the sequel to her best selling novel\\"P.G. County\\".  Good story telling of greed, jealousy, bitterness, adultry and betrayal.  This story will capture your attention and hold it until the very end.  Although it's been a while since P.G. County was published, the sequel picks right up where the other book left off and I was able to roll right along with the entire story non-stop.

Ms. Cooper takes you down a dirt road creating passion, fear, prejudice, excitement and an enormous amount of misery but in the end there is triumph.    <br /> <br />This book is a masterpiece, just like all her other books and it tells a story that only Ms. Cooper can write.  J. California Cooper has her own unique way of story telling which is why I missed her so much.  It's good to read your writing again....Welcome back... <br />	2005-02-08

This is a different area of writing for Ms. Wesley, however, I did enjoy her novel.  The problems with these characters were typical for people who never learned how to love.  Medora was a strong woman and  knew what she wanted out of life.  Randall never felt love,was never taught how to love so when he had love, he didn't know what he had.  Ana had been hurt before, but was willing to give love another chance and thought that Randall was the right man for her, however, Ana was misguided again.

First of all, I would like to salute \\"Sir Victor\\" for such a well-written book.  This story not only had substance but reality.  I actually cried for Kennedy, Leagcy, Morris, Rorey, Marshall and Jasmine.  I cried because I actually felt their pain and felt their ignorance.  I cried because today we still have those who continue to have un-protected sex and feel they are untouchable.  In the end it all worked out, but sometimes life has a way of giving you a wake-up call and thank God the few that heard the call woke up right in the nick of time. As for Mr. Simpson, well, he was playing a game that he could not win and in the end he realized that he was only fooling himself. Unfortunately, Kennedy had to suffer because of someone to ignorant to realize that the game being played there aren't any winners.  Overall, excellent book, great writing and I can't wait to read your next book.  Hats off to you \\"Sir Victor\\"...Yes Yes!	2002-09-17

Great writing and story telling about a group of people that made money by acting out different con games. Dante, Pam, Big Slim, Scamz, Jackson, Robin and others played games with people lives and that is dangerous.  I really do believe that Dante was looking for love in all the wrong places, Pam was to selfish to love anyone other than herself.  Scamz forgot what love was long time ago when he sold his soul to the devil.  Poor Jackson, a man without a country and Robin, again, looking for love in all the wrong places.

This book was well written and very explicit.  I enjoyed &quot;True to the game&quot; also, but this story took another turn to me.  True to the game was a great love story  and a little ganster which kept me interested. I imagined what Gina &amp; Quadir looked like in my mind and believe it or not when I completed reading that book, I felt like I lost something.  Now B-More Careful to me was more about how these pretty ladies chased money using their looks, and bodies, and what they endured during the process. What was so sad was how these young ladies saw &quot;pain&quot; as &quot;love&quot;. Now, at least &quot;Netta&quot; realized that she needed to change her way of thinking and respect herself which would gain respect from others.  The other ladies never came to that conclusion and I guess that is why they are still running that &quot;tried&quot; game. Netta had a secoind chance at life but you know in the real world sometime you don't have a second chance.  All in all this was a good book and I will continue to read her literature as long as Terri/Shannon continue to produce such outstanding material.	2002-04-17

Why did I enjoy it?  <BR>Because it is so real to life, and you never know what curve balls life may throw your way, so it's best to be prepared if at all possible. Nathan is lucky he got his family back, Victor realized that ALL woman aren't meant to be toyed with and poor Clifford, out of all 3 brothers, he suffered to most because he had a problem of letting go and that is his marriage... My heart really went out to him when he went back to his house and beat up the ex-wife boyfriend because he attatcked Cliffords' children.  Now, he could have killed that man, thank god his mother and brothers were there help him.  Divorce is not funny, it is very serious, especially when children are involved.

It touched my heart and soul and recaptured my childhood years of growing up with my cousins, and all the good times we shared.  Family is so important, but it becomes even more important once you reach your adult years.  Ms. Jackson, I've read ALL of your books and I've enjoyed them, especially reading about the tall, handsome Madaris brothers, but, you really did it with this one.  I could'nt put it down because I did'nt want to.  I still read certain chapters of the book, it was soooo good. I lost my grandparents almost 20 years ago, and I miss them so much, so I can really relate to Tae, Rae'Jean, and the others the way they missed their grandmother Idella...  Family can be a pain in the you what at times, but when things are going good and you are having a good ole time at the reunion, Life can be so sweet...	2001-09-28

Overall, this was a story about lovers that went their seperate way during their  college years and reunited in their adulthood.  Rosie, a bright young energetic entrepreneur ready to face the world, but afraid to take another chance at love because of being hurt the first time.  Lamar a bright, good looking young man returns home to a new job, and to learn that his ex-girlfriend from college resides in the same town.  The two meet up after a 12 year break.  Lemar still has feelings for Rosie, but he is also a little nervous about reuniting because of the way they broke off.  Rosie has a secret that she kept from Lamar for 12 years, but it is that secret that brings them together again.  All in all, I did enjoy the story, very romatic and entertaining.

I am so glad that Sandy was able to find love due to all of her suffering and disappointments. Poor Janice, she did'nt know how to love that is why she had so many problems in her life with her lovers, she did'nt know how to express herself because she did'nt know herself due to the up bringing and all that went on during her tender years. Brittney, well, she realized that Maurice was her blessing, but the harsh words from Sandy, Brittney discovered that she can make decisions and follow them through, not only that, but when she and Maurice had financial problems, it was she that stepped out and made ends meet. She finally realized her potential and her ability to lead instead of follow for the rest of her life. Now Margaret, she too had disappointments, but she was able to do something about her set backs or should I say addition.I hope that Winston found the love that he deserved in his life, and Cliff, I guess he and Rachel became an item.  I only hope that it worked out for them.  All in all,I really enjoyed this book, it was entertaining, and very real to life. I just can't wait until the next book comes out...	2001-09-10

This book bought closure to the Quinten Parker saga.  I felt somewhat possessive of Quin, I really would have preferred that he and Nikita made a go of it, but due to her untimely dealth that was impossible.  It is good to know that he was able to find love with someone and, hopefully he and Rae will live happily ever after.  I admire the way the story was bought to a close and in the end, all parties involved appeared to be happy.  I felt as if that  was the end of a story well told, and sort of sad to see the saga end of Quin Parker, Nikita, Maxine,&amp; etc. but life must go on and I did enjoy this episode.  Donna, you did it again, this is an excellent book and I enjoyed it as I always enjoy your writing.	2001-06-18

Let me say I do not condone affairs with married individuals and as far as I'm concerned, there are no exscuses.The word married means married, no matter how unhappy that individual may be, if the relationship is that bad, get out of it legally and then go for it.  There are to many problems to deal with and you know that old saying, what comes around goes around.  I did enjoy the way Ms. Rice wrote the story which kept my interest.

The plot was good but, it was,nt as catching as I would have preferred. College life is so different from  real life  and I believe you see various situations that you take for granted in college, and once introduced to  9 - 5 life, you see things for what they are and not what you desire them to be.  I believe this young man had a hard time reaching maturity which bought on problems in his adult life.  Sometime you have to reach out to people and not take what others may say, but research for yourself and gain the real answer.It appeared this young man held a grudge because what happened to their relationship when they were students and could not overcome the past, which bought problems  in the future.  Get over it and move on... To me that part was boring and I could'nt get past that chapter.	2001-05-18

The &quot;Prince&quot; was enchanting, exciting, handsome, classy and a real catch, however, his lady friend did not have the traits to make a &quot;princess&quot; bride, but, that is what made the book exciting the formula that worked and the end result was a real love match.

Ms. Williams writing is to be commended.  She really knows how to grab you into the lives of the characters.  Again, good writing with substance.  I only wished that Imagany would have kept in touch with her sister Zabree, perhaps if they did not loose communication, Zabree would not have turned to drugs to avoid thinking about the abuse she absorbed by her father.  Another thing, incest is a sinful matter one that should be taken very serious, I only wished Ms. Williams would had touch that subject a bit more than what she did.  It somewhat was left untouched being that the father was killed and you never heard anymore of the incest thing.  Overall, good read and good writing.	2001-02-19

At first, it was a little slow, but, then it began to pick up and I could not put it down.  This book is about falling in love, but, loving the right person.  Sometimes in life, we put obstacles in our own paths which makes it hard for us to the forest for the trees which is sad.  Two people whom really loved each other, but, 1 person mad a choice earlier in life that affected his future.  The future has a past and we all need to remember that.  The ending was sad, Mr. Man not being man enoug to break off the relationship pulled a disappering act, but, life goes on...  All in all, I did enjoy this book and Ms. Rice writing.

Not only was it a fast read, but a good read, at one point, I could not put the book down.  Addition is addition, but, I never thought of being addicted to sex.  Zane was able to focus on her addition and the problems that the addition caused in Zoe personal life and professional life.  Jason, Zoe husband was a little different.  Personally, I thought he should have informed Zoe that he was adopted prior to their getting married, but he didnt, that piece of information came out later.  All in all, this was a fantastic book. the family relationship was tight and thank God because if Zoe married anyone else, her ending might not have turned out the way it did, and everyone was satisfied in the end.  This book should be made into a movie, it is just that good and I will continue to read her writing.  Zane, may the force be with you...	2001-01-26

The female was so unsure of herself, and it almost ruined her life and someone elses. This is something that can be a problem in reality no need to make it a fantasy.
