It is not, to any real extent, a biography. Those seeking such should move on. <br /> <br />As an academic book it leans on the dry side. It assumes the reader has a fairly good knowledge of Children's Literature and 20th Century cartoons (not the animated kind). Not a book to begin your Dr. Seuss experience with. But if you have read them to your children and are interested about the writing style (there is a good chapter about his poetry) or his art style (not as good a chapter, but still interesting).  <br /> <br />What interested me the most was the deconstruction of the recent rush to \\"cash in\\" on Seuss by Hollywood and advertisers. I think that Nel wants to come down against it, but based on Seuss' background (he started out drawing Flit ads) and the projects he approved during his lifetime; it is a tough argument to make. In the end though Nel does point out that maybe the movies and tie- ins did not have to be so... crass? <br /> <br />The book is well researched; lots of neat tidbits are to be gleamed. Early cartoons by Seuss for PM magazine were occasionally (by today's standards) shockingly racist. It makes him a little more human and puts his latter works like the Lorax in a new light.  <br /> <br />Those in Education may enjoy this background. Fans of Seuss will enjoy the exhaustive bibliography of Seuss's many, many works. Also good list of other works about the man.  <br />	2005-02-10

Bear's fully imagined universe (not so, so, distant future) is simply amazing. He explains without getting lost in detail or glossing over key stuff. His New York of the future is a book in itself, never mind the complete and functional Mars he imagines. No puffy \\"terra forming\\" cop out for him, but realistic, hard scrabble living. <br />Key is his imagining of the future of nano technology, already being worked on in labs today, Bear puts his own spin on it. Fascinating stuff even if we are probably centuries away from the reality. Less clear are his \\"educational bacteria and virus\\" but that's ok. <br />The plot it not bad. It involves politics, but it is no Dune in those terms. I would guess that the political plot points are there to move the story along. The characters are all believable (even the bad guys have some dimension to them). The love life of the main folks seems a little thin, but hey, no room for everything!<br />One major problem I had was with the crucial plot point. Without giving too much away, to do what was done, even the first time, would in my mind create tremendous reactions on earth and mars. Neat idea but it strains credibility. <br />Still, a great read, lots of fun and well imagined.	2004-07-09

In often interminable detail he lays out two cultures, one alien in the outer-space kind of way and a second alien to Westerners kind of way. I found it fascinating and a refreshing change of pace that the lead characters in this novel were often a)women and b) non-white/European. Add to the mix a \\"given\\" that the main religions of the future are Islam and Hindu (with plenty of Jewish and Christian folks still around) and you get a rich bed for Oberndorf to plant his story.<br />Too bad it is the story itself that brings down this book. Granted, I don't need a \\"space opera\\" everytime, but good story telling demands some sort of recognizable story arc, some reason for being. And this book demands also a reason for slogging through Oberndorf's endless anthropology lectures. In the end this story is not delivered. What we get are two parallel stories that may or may not be occurring at the same time. And neither one has an ending or makes much sense (in the end). There is no pay off of any kind and frankly after getting through the 400 pages of academia I was hoping that a good yarn would be the result.<br />Instead we get a vague, \\"high art\\" end which is not satisfying in any sense of the word. I am not even sure what I was supposed to learn. In the end the carefully laid out universe stops, prior to reaching any sort of conclusion-real or imagined. The only really thought out part of the book is the background on the Ju'/hoansi (actually spelled JU/'hoansi everywhere outside the book) in Namibia.<br />In good consciousness I can not recommend this book to anyone as all it will do is waste their time. Instead check out The Dobe Ju/'Hoansi by Richard B. Lee (referenced by Oberndorf several times). To hear some of the music try -- Namibia: Songs of the Ju'hoansiBushmen.	2004-06-22

I have found it best to read several different sources on things to get an idea of what a) the options are b) the different school of thought are and c) what the consensus is on issue. There were a few places where I found Dr. Cohen's advice a little too easy going (for instance the cooked/uncooked honey advice- cooking honey will NOT kill the botulism that might be present, best to skip it altogether for infants).    <br />Some other books that have proved helpful: <BR>Secrets of the Baby Whisperer  by MELINDA BLAU (Author), TRACY HOGG (Author) and On Becoming Baby Wise  by Gary Ezzo, et al - both are helpful on deciding how to get your baby to sleep longer at night (or at night at all).

This is the best book for detailed (more so than Dr. Cohen's book) advice about child rearing. Not as breezy as The New Basics but much more comprehensive. <br />In the end remember ANY book is going to have an angle/agenda.

Peter Biskind writes in great detail and depth about the rise and bladning out of Mirimax Pictures. Oh, also notes a little about Sundance, Alliance and October films. Apparently Biskind is trying to sew up the whole Indie film movement that rose up in the 90s, but really this book is an excuse to pretty much fire up and roast Harvey Weinstein. <br />Not that Weinstein is a bad choice of subject, he is practically a caricature to begin with and with Biskind's in dept interviewing the stories about Weinstein are endless. I would have to say that is the main gripe I have with the book. It is ironic that a book that obviously needed a stronger editor goes on and on (and on) about \\"Harvey Scissorhands\\" and the damage he did to films. <br />Biskind shows no mercy, and little objectivity, with Weinstein. He notes how `ol Scissor hands cut up \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" much to everyone's chagrin. But he doesn't mention that the \\"uncut\\" version was later released to almost universal critical pans. <br />Yet, clearly, in the end, Biskind does much to support the argument that the Weinstein brother's did as much damage as good to the indie film world (and movies in general). It is a fascinating read, although towards the end the repeated examples of Harvey blowing his lid become tedious. That and Biskind's habit of reconstructing conversations and putting the \\"f\\" bomb every third word. People may really speak that way in Hollywood, but for the reader it becomes tedious. <br />The stuff about Sundance and October films seems pretty thin (maybe there simply wasn't much to report). Redford comes across as a sort of uncaring jerk, but hey, think about how many vanity record labels and films imprints have been run into the ground by egotistical stars. <br />Interesting stuff, makes me want to check out \\"Easy Riders...\\" also by Biskind.	2004-06-07

I am tired of the one line author bios (\\"Lives in Maine with his wife and four cats...\\") but in the end papers of Tuf Voyaging we get Mr. Martin's CV for goodness sake. The man has a lot to be proud of, but really, come on. Let's keep the ego in check a little.<br />Besides, the book speaks for itself. I understand it is \\"cobbled\\" together from stories published previously, but for myself, coming in unawares, the chapters work just fine. The opening chapter deals with how Tuf gets an amazing space ship, a bio-engineering \\"ark\\" (in one of the less subtle moments the ship is named, um, The Ark). Then we get introduced to an over populated planet in need of help (and desiring The Ark). Then a few more chapters, cleverly showing how Tuf uses the Ark in unexpected ways to both help people and satisfy his sense of morals.<br />The books works because a) it is endlessly inventive, always  the hallmark of good science fiction, and b) clever in execution. Each chapter lays out an interesting problem which Tuf then proceeds to, in his own droll way, solve. Not always the way people expect or want him too, but in a way which is interesting nonetheless. <br />I do have to agree the novel ends some what poorly. Martin boxes himself into a corner and then offers a fairly mediocre (if not logical) way out, but the rest of the book more than makes up for it. <br />Hey, it's a fun read, it makes you think (and imagine) and yet does not dumb things down or present silly ideas just for shock or novelty value. Highly recommended.	2004-05-20

They found it the only way to help their baby calm down (that and a trip to the doctor's to check to allergies, which you should do to rule out food allergies if you suspect colic). <BR>So far my wife and I have found the book useful and our infant does not seem to have colic. It is useful for getting the infant back to sleep from hour one of their life. The techniques worked wonders and the reasoning behind the techniques makes perfect sense to this layman. The techniques are also useful for calming your baby. For instance if you need to feed but the baby is too upset to take to the breast. <BR>All in all a life saver.

Well, look, you get what you pay for with this book. It was never meant to change the way we look at books and I am sure there are far greater crimes which have been committed against literature in the name of a fast buck. <br />There is not much here. Don't get this for the gossip. You're average People magazine article on AI has more dirt. Some of Cowell's insights in the world of pop music are funny and well, insightful. You have to give the guy credit for calling a spade a spade. Oftentimes he does seem to pick safe targets-Madonna, Prince, Michael Jackson, everyone knows they are \\"over\\" (until their next hit of course) so picking on them seems boring. <br />It is interesting that Simon readily admits that people in the pop music business would have never picked Clay or Rueben. But then again this (third) season of AI finds Simon picking even more young wanna-be Britney's, despite his book length lecture on not trying to force people to like a certain kind of singer. But the whole book tends to read like that. One can imagine Cowell and several focus group types going over the manuscript, trying to fine tune it to make it appear they are exposing AI without actually having to say much. <br />If you are a fan of the show it is almost worth checking out this book. It is a decent beach read, as long as you don't plan to spend more than a few hours at the beach.	2004-04-13

But I found The Meaning... to be a vastly superior book. Frankly I think that The Professor... would have made a good, long, chapter in this book (as it is you have several pages of rehash to retell Minor's story).<br />I think what makes book better is that Winchester has more meat to chew on. The making of the OED was not a simple affair and the whole thing seems to have very nearly met its end on more than one occasion. The book reads like a fantastic novel, complete with good guys and evil villains. And along the way you get to learn a good deal about a) the English language, b) lexicography (Dictionary study) and c) the English society that produced such a monumental (in all meanings of the word) work.  <br />I felt a little cheated towards the end when the last 70 odd years of the OED are wrapped up in a few pages. I would have found it fascinating to learn more how the work of gathering up new words for the planned 2007 edition has changed since the original plan in the 1860s. And Winchester still tends to wander just a bit too much for my taste. <br />All in all a good solid read that will entertain and edify at the same time.	2004-04-06

Basically, the story recounts how a paranoid bi-polar man helped write and research a huge portion of the world largest dictionary. The professor is the then editor who befriends the man, not knowing his new-found contributor resides in an insane asylum. <BR>Along the way we get fascinating peeks into the creation of the OED, Victorian and Edwardian views on mental health and quite a few other asides. <BR>I am not sure that this is a book so much as a long magazine article (think New Yorker style). Occasionally it seems that Winchester overuses foreshadowing and previewing to \\"fluff\\" the work up into book length. At one point he mentions that the event he was going to talk about was the most important even in the 20th century. What he does talk about next is very interesting, but he offers no clue as to how, even in the context of the story, the event was \\"the most important event.\\" Hyperbole like that is strewn throughout the book and does not need to be. This story is fascinating on its own. <BR>A good light read. It is probably an excellent introductory text for College students as it is more of a springboard to other topics than a complete in-depth exploration of anything on its own.	2004-03-23

At its best it tells the story of what happened to the giant syrup manufacturer after 1990. But the main problem with the book is Hays insistence on a non-linear style that works poorly when presenting history. She often starts a story and then stop--moving on to pick up another thread. Sometimes she comes back to finish the first thread, often she just mentions it in passing in another thread. The result is a convoluted, hard to follow story of Coke in the 1990s. Perhaps it is a refreshing change from the straight forward \\"and then this happened\\" approach, but it makes for difficult reading. <br />Hays does a good job researching, she obviously spoke with many key people in Coke's world (or used other sources). Often though the book reads like a magazine article, long on colorful quotes and interesting asides, short on a central narrative drive. <br />If you have read Pendergrast and want to get updated (through the turn of the century at least) then Hays will do the job. But if you know only vague details about Coke then you should start with For God, Country and Coca-Cola.	2004-03-23
US	51967403	R3T0D71PRDZG6N	0451459156	504828940	Ruled Britannia	Books	3	4	6	N	N	weak plot, but a diverting read	This is only my second Turtledove book. I decided to give him a second chance after Gundpowder Empire, which had a good premise and interesting ideas but a lousy plot. I stand by my initial assessment of Turtledove's strengths after this novel.   Ruled Britannia is on one level a fascinating book- very well researched. Turtledove pays close attention to language and events, but in the end this is also what brings book down. The basic plot is that the Spanish are occupying England after throwing Elizabeth off the throne. If you have some background in English history (and it helps to know alittle bit since things are not spelled out) you would know that around this time in the novel England had defeated the Spanish Armada, securing England's place as a world power. Elizabeth had also come to the throne and undone her step-sister Mary's religious reforms. Mary had aimed to bring England back into the Roman Catholic fold after her father, Henry VIII embraced Protestantism. (yes, it's a little confusing, which is maybe why Turtledove does not go into it too much).    Shakespeare has been hired to write a radical subversive play which English revolutionaries hope will bring down Spanish rule. Far fetched? Yes, but this is fiction so that's ok. It works a premise to hang a snapshot of Elizabethan England on. But instead of an interesting plot and actual event, we get endless, and I mean endless, pages of dialogue in which Turtledove shows off his ability to write witty banner in Elizabethan English. He admits he borrows a lot from the works of Marlowe, Shakespeare and more, but  still doesn't lessen the groan inducing \\"quotes\\" from famous Shakespeare plays. To make things seem more \\"real\\" in this alternative world Turtledove also has an annoying habit of changing play titles and quotes juuuust enough to make them \\"alternate.\\" \\"Prince of Denmark\\" instead of \\"Hamlet.\\" \\"Love Labour's Won\\" instead of \\"Love's Labour Lost.\\" I would say it was all just a bit precocious except that Turtledove is a grown man. Instead I'll say it is a bit twee, almost sophomoric. [it has been pointed out to me that these are titles used on some copies of the plays or also \\"lost\\" plays. So perhaps I am being  abit harsh here...]    Once one gets past the pages of witty banner there is not much left. Like Gunpowder Empire little seems to happen plot wise. Even when things do happen, an exciting swordfight for instance- the actual fight is over in a couple of paragraphs, but then we get several pages of people talking about the fight, using snatches of grade school Spanish (another annoying device meant to convey that the Spaniards in the story speak Spanish not English).     Is this a good beach read- maybe (some people might find the Elizabethan word play a little taxing) - but really not much more. It is clear that Mr. Turtledove is a man of many exceptional talents, novelists just does not seem to be one of them. Check it out at your library and read during lunch or on the subway/carpool ride.	2004-02-04

I found that book to be enchanting (although often times a bit obscure with out any good reason to be so). whereas Wicked is just as enchanting, but a weaker novel. <br />Wicked, which looks at the life and times of the Wicked Witch of the West from the movie Wizard of Oz, is in many ways an amazing book, but some serious flaws prevent it from being an all time classic. As L. Frank Baum: Creator of Oz by Katharine M. Rogers points out, Wicked really draws from the movie and less so from the books. Although in Maguire's defense, he does seem to get the style of names right for those that he makes up. In both the movie and the books, the Wicked Witch of the West  (and East for that matter) are little more than props. Maguire fleshes out her story, giving her a background, a life. He does a remarkable job of probing deep into Baum's world without disrupting it. <br />To his credit he does not rely too heavily on the Freudian sense of a doomed childhood forming an evil adult (although he comes close to that and certainly her childhood helped form her as an adult). Instead he focuses on who one's search for a purpose in life often leads us to make \\"bad\\" choices, which other perceive as evil. <br />The two main problems with the book are style and characters. Again, I find that Maguire often writes obscurely, as if trying to infuse his writing with a feeling or an artistic style. In a story already so rich in detail this just comes across as overload. I often found myself wishing he would just get on with things rather than trying so hard to make this \\"literature.\\"<br />Secondly, and this is the biggest problem, the main character comes across as dull and uninteresting. How on earth could a character with as much potential as this be so flat is the crime here. She does not do much and fails to act more than act. I guess this is part of what Maguire is trying tosay, but it leaves a big hole in the middle of the book. Not helping matters is the large number of rich characters that come and go in the story. One wishes that perhaps more could have been done with Boc or Prof. Dillard or even Glinda, but perhaps they too are not strong enough to carry the whole story.   <br />Still, I recommend this book to most anyone. Yes, you will have to leave reality behind (unlike Confessions, where Maguire was trying to leave fantasy behind to inject realism into the fairytale) but the world he creates in engrossing. Now if Maguire could have just pulled a good novel out of that world...	2004-01-22

Turtledove uses the ideal of parallel worlds and thus alternative histories. In this case, a world where the Roman Empire never fell and primitive muskets and cannons are state of the art. The twist is that living in this world are people from our own future, where they have found a way to travel to these parallel worlds and exploit their resources. As resources run low on our world, \\"traders\\" go to parallel worlds and get the stuff we need.<br />Conceptually this is very interesting stuff, and Turtledove does a reasonable job explaining how and why history would be different, as well as how these people would have developed socially etc.  He is a little sketchy on how exactly this kind of parallel world travel works (he is no Michael Crichton). <br />The main problem with this book is that once this is all established, and the characters (Traders from our world) are set up, not much happens. The Characters seem to get into some sticky situations, but then sort of just get out of trouble, setting a pattern of non-events for the whole book. Not to give things away, but the characters are never in any \\"real\\" danger, there is no compelling narrative drive. <br />Perhaps a worthwhile paperback or library book but save your money otherwise.	2004-01-14

As the author states in the introduction it is not a biography, but rather looks at each major films Lucas has been connected with, exploring the creative process, major themes and other aspects. The book, it seems, it aimed at film students mainly, giving brief overviews of different parts of the production process (scripting, casting, production). It also looks at major themes, the tendency of Lucas' films to go \\"forwards/backwards\\" in the story line and the use of music. <br />I am not sure exactly who this book is aimed at. Film school student may find the book a little thin on details, casual fans will find it a little dry. There are plenty of tidbits, trivia and anecdotes, but since the book never decides if it is aimed at the general public or USC grad students, it tends to be unsatisfying. Smith also tends to come off as a Lucas apologist. Sometimes he is correct in pointing out the impossible problem of pleasing rabid fans and snooty critics, but at other times he seems to be arguing that Lucas is just \\"misunderstood,\\" to me a sign of a weak argument. <br />Smith has obviously done his homework, and his notes about the multiple versions of the film are interesting with out resorting to trainspotting. Speaking of which, his distinctly UK viewpoint is sometimes interesting for it's removed objectivity, but also can get in the way when he must cross cultural barriers to understand the very American Lucas. <br />Good launching pad for the discussion of Lucas' work, it makes a case that Lucas' main contribution to film has been technical not narrative.	2003-12-18

If you liked the PBS specials then you really should do yourself a favor and read this book. The show glossed over a tremendous amount of what was going on behind the scenes and politically during each marriage. The various struggles, both religious and political, make for a fascinating picture. Starkey presents a good case that this time period marks a watershed moment in British history in terms of the reformation of the Church and the monarchy in general. <br />The book is a fairly easy read, not academic but aimed more at the mass market. This is not to say it is poorly researched, Starkey has obviously done his homework and presents a wealth of information. However the tone is fairly casual and the story told in a sort of breathless way that will keep the layman interested but strike the academic as a bit much. <br />Read this with a critical eye as Henry does come off a something of a jerk. There is no doubt he was driven and fairly ruthless, but this account focuses on the wives, necessarily at Henry's expense. <br />The only real problem is one most likely due to what Starkey had to work with. A great deal of the book is spent on Catherine of Aragon, and a fair amount on Anne Boleyn. The last four wives are given increasing short shifts, but I suspect that is due more to the lack of source material on some of them. That and the fact Catherine of Aragon was Queen long than the rest put together. <br />This is a fantastic introduction to the history of Tudor England. Good enough that it made me seek out Starkey's \\"Elizabeth: The Struggle for the Throne\\" which, in many ways, is a sequel to this book and worth reading in an of itself (although necessarily there is a lot of overlap).	2003-11-21

Often the author does stray into the \\"you kids today!\\" territory, but just as often his observations are dead on.<br />Here's the real problem with this book, it was written over a long weekend. The narrative rambles, like it was dictated by someone also doing the Sunday Times crossword at the same time. Ideas are put forth, support promised and then several paragraphs of asides, by the end of which you have forgotten what the hell was going on. This style of writing gets old very quickly.

I do not doubt for a minute when the author says he did poorly in writing classes. <br />The one great lesson from the book is its explanation why the hero in a movie always finds a parking space right where he needs to park- a movie (and a script) is all about the action.<br />Another minor quibble is how Goldman stresses over and over again about how important the script is, and how critics never seem to mention the script, unless the movie is bad. He seems to think a bad movie is more about bad actors. All in all sort of a double standard.<br />The edition I read (hardback) was full of typos (is it Durbant or Durband? Same sentence, make up your mind). <br />All in all a great collection of anecdotes and insights rendered almost worthless by sloppy writing.	2003-10-28

Although this book seems a bit on the dry side, it is nevertheless a well researched biography of a very influential writer almost forgotten (although obviously his Oz works continue to be important- albeit mostly due to the MG film).<br />Rogers does well to show how his background involvement in the suffragette movement most likely helped to inspire him to write one of the few female protagonist in fantasy literature (one only has to look to Harry Potter to see how little progress the genre has made in the past 100 years).  One wonders if Rogers stumbled upon the curious fact that Baum's mother-in-law was a prominent member of the New York state women's movement at the turn of the century when she was researching some of her other books. <br />But over all the book seems to fall flat in giving the reader s true sense of the man and his times. While there is a fair amount of background on Baum's involvement with the women's movement and Theosophy neither aspect is fully developed for the reader. Rogers seems to feel that the reader ought to know exactly how these movements fit into turn-of-the-century life and what they were all about. Granted 1900 America is not exactly foreign to today's readers, but many of the ideals that people in that time subscribed to are all but forgotten. The women's movement is not feminism as we understand it today, a little more detail and background would help. <br />Over all one does not get a sense of the time and place Baum existed in. Granted, his life was fairly boring, routine and seems, despite constant money troubles, fairly well off. However context would help establish a reason to care about Baum other than the fact one might enjoy his writing. There are plenty of text synopses, but little delving into where the stories came from. Was he simply trying to modernize the fairytale? Based on Rogers book one gets the impression Baum was something of a hack, simply grinding out tales for children. I feel that there is more to hiswritings than that.<br />Kudos to Rogers for exploring fully Baum's non-Oz works. Again, a little more follow up (beyond the four or five paragraphs at the end) about what happened to the Oz series after Baum died and what happened to his copyrights etc (is the book in public domain? What happened to his original  publishing house as I do not recall they still exist...?) His influence has been great ( C S Lewis owes at least a small debt to Baum) but Rogers seems to attribute it all to the MGM movie.	2003-10-20

What would you do? How would you spend the money?<br />Of course nothing is that simple, or you wouldn't have this third rate \\"thriller.\\" Naturally the person who \\"wins\\" is flawed and on the same day she is to buy the winning ticket gets involved with what looks like a murder, with her as the murderer. Of course. <BR>And it goes downhill from there, one unbelievable thing after another happens, stretching even the most open \\"John Grisham\\" minded minds. The main villain here continently speaks in \\"expose,\\" like some James Bond villain, telling his would be victims exactly how he did things. This is lazy writing folks, show, don't \\"tell.\\"<BR>There are \\"amazing\\" coincidences that pop up in the book, connections between characters that you never see coming because they are not necessary to tell the story, people being able to anticipate other's actions- 100% of the time, the list just goes on. <BR>The story also skips a ten year period that would have been interesting and helpful to character development. Instead the ten year period is used as a handy way to explain away an changes in the characters. <BR>Good idea, lazy execution.	2003-10-14
US	51967403	R1LQY0O3OLC7OO	0312963009	638192149	Neanderthal	Books	3	7	9	N	N	beach read,	This is at best a good beach read. Fluff with some substance. Darnton sets out an interesting premise and lay outs some of the science behind it. Unfortunetly there are huge logic leaps and the book often requires a large amount of &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; to work. <br />It is clearly written in the mode of &quot;Jurrasic Park&quot; or &quot;Congo&quot; with an eye for a movie deal (the book jacket all but screams it) which is fine, but Darnton's scientific expose does not come near Crichton's style. <br />Sufice to say, like Crichton, the characters are there to talk about science, get into &quot;danger&quot; but not much else. <br />Would be a great book for a long flight or a lazt day at the beach.	2003-10-07

Occasionally sentences which might sound fine read aloud look odd and a hard to read when written. After a while one gets used to it (or Card eases up a bit) and it ceases to be a problem. <BR>Secondly- I am not sure why this is a separate book, except for the obvious commercial possibilities. It seems to me that with a little editing, this could be \\"part one\\" of a larger book (this is only a couple hundred pages after all). Instead you are forced to fork over your money for what would be the first 4 chapters of any other book.<br />However, the tale does unfold (ohhhh so slowly) in a nice way. The concept of a North America after a failed 1776 revolution is interesting, and one hopes that Card explores this more in future volumes. The characters are a little wooden, only the \\"Taleswapper\\" seems to escape one dimensionality. <br />In the end the fact that this book is 100% set up makes it rate a \\"not worth buying but worth checking out of the public library\\" for me.	2003-10-01

Ledbetter was the editor for the European edition of the Industry Standard, so while not an outsider, he spent his time in NYC or London, far away from the San Fran offices,this is not exactly an inside view either. <br />The result reads like an in depth business journal article (which figures, based on the authors background) by someone with really good connections. There are some interesting stories, some tidbits about what went on in the \\"fat year\\" (but not enough) and some amusing insights. <br />The book falls flat because Ledbetter fails to really explain what went on from the inside. He barely scratches the surface, constantly back tracking, covering himself (no surprise based on the seeming constant threats of libel suits during his tenure) and generally trying to play both sides. He wants to dig up the dirt, but he also wants to continue working in the publishing business. The result is like the version of events an adult would tell a child, the story is the same, the details just get glossed over. <br />Not the dot.com expose we have been waiting for.	2003-09-16

It explores the origins of the plan to bring Indians over, the background of those brought over and how they were dealt with legally and in reality. <br />Plenty of original sources are cited and used. For this issue I would say this is the best place to start.	2003-09-10

I use this as a first reading in my Comparative politics classes. For most students this is the first they have heard of the genocide in Rwanda and it really helps to open up classroom discussion about the role of politics and the state in \\"real life.\\"<br />It is a fairly easy read, although obviously the subject matter can make it difficult to get through. Most students High School and above will find its language clear and compelling, which also helps them get into the idea of reading for the course. <br />Some good talking points that came out of discussion on the book: Is Gourevitch presenting a one-sided argument and is that okay? What role does colonialism play in shaping the present day reality in Africa? Why did the UN not intervene sooner? What is ethnicity exactly if not based on race or language is it still ethnicity? What role does the state have in strong societies?	2003-09-10

The amazing \\"world\\" that Stabelford lays out in this book is almost like another character, and in many ways is the most interesting character in the book. The actual characters here are, for the most part, little more than brief outlines and seem to be there only to talk about and describe the changes to the earth 300 years on. Only \\"Oscar Wilde\\" has any depth, and then only to serve as a link back to 20th century earth's culture and literature. <br />The mystery here is a mcguffin, serving little more than as a stage on which the marvels of bio-engineering and nanotechnology can unfold. <br />But, let's not damn this book with faint praise. The description of the earth and what happened from 2000-2400 is very well done and worth the read alone. Like any good (not great, but good) science fiction novel the main joy of reading is finding out how things have changed, how the author thinks problems will be solved and what new problems will come up because of the changes.	2003-09-03
US	51967403	RWPMDLBFPOQPG	0684837188	301810439	Lost Discoveries : The Ancient Roots of Modern Science--from the Babylonians to the Maya	Books	5	5	10	N	N	Will be interesting to the lay person, will spark discussion	Lost Discoveries is a fascinating read, especially for the non-scientist like myself. The author does a good job of explaining broad scientific theories and area of study and then tries to show how non-Western, non-European peoples explored and made advances in many areas of science that most of us are taught had their beginnings in renaissance Europe. For example the advanced math of Babylonia, India and Egypt that dealt with concepts that Greek math did not. <br />Teresi makes a good case that a lot of this ancient science pre dates modern Western \\"discoveries,\\" although at times the \\"science\\" that the ancients did seems only vaguely related to modern concepts of the same science. A better book might have spent more time on what how and why European authors stole (or borrowed) from non-Western sources. Teresi makes reference to anti-Islamic prejudice in renaissance Europe but does not explore that. I guess in a popular science book there is not room for the same rigorous defense in a more academic book. I just wish it was more clearly linked. At times I assume that the ancient discoveries were really lost and that Western scientists just stumbled on the same answers 1000 years later. Teresi does not do a good job convincing me otherwise except in a few cases mentioned in the beginning of the book.<br />This is an excellent book for undergraduates, the non-scientist or as a launching pad for class discussion about how History is written. It is very informative, but needs to be read with an eye towards some skepticism.	2003-09-03

There are some problems with believability, not sure how a society that is so backwards still has zippers for instance. And several plot points don't seem to make sense. At one point the characters do away with what might have been an invaluable source of info just because they are asked too. For some reason that really bothered me.<br />But, overall the tale is ingrossing and imaginative. Don't think too much and it is a fun read.	2003-08-19

He does a neat job of showing the real life events that might be transformed into magic in a fairy tale. Real enough to be believable but just enough magic to make it seem fantastical. <br />A somewhat slight read, it won't make you question life, but it was enjoyable.	2003-07-30
