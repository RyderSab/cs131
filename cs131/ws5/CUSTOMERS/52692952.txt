Written similar in style to Alice Hoffman or Jodi Picoult, this is a must read for fans of those authors.  <br /> <br />I'm thrilled there is a new, talented and inspiring writer that I can add to my 'favorite authors' list.

Like some of the other reviewers, I initially found it difficult to 'get into' the characters, the story itself, and the plot. However, once I did, and once I was able to imagine myself in the dance Picoult's writing takes, I was mesmerized. I have never felt the kind of connection with characters in any novel as I have with this one. <br /> <br />That said, it is far different from Jodi Picoult's other novels. I'm glad that was not my first Picoult novel to read. But, I feel honored to have been able to read this one when I did.  <br /> <br />This is a magical book, if you give it the chance.  <br />	2005-04-30

I have been on the edge of my seat with all of Sally Beauman's books, but sadly, this one fell far short of my expectations. I had eagerly read the first two books in this series, and had expected this one to be just as good. Sadly, it was, for lack of a better word, dull. The 'loose ends' to be wrapped up just didn't 'work' for me, and I nearly put the novel down three or four times. Unfortunately, finishing it didn't make it any better.<br />Sally Beauman's other books are remarkable with hard-to-discover twists and turns. This book is simply not of the same quality.	2004-04-27

Unlike many readers, I honestly didn't have any problem letting go of history and embracing the fun of this *fictional* story. Dan Brown was not attempting to write a historical document, nor was he trying to rewrite art history. He wrote a mystery, full of suspense and drama. By using commonly known works, Brown makes this story much more accesible to most readers.<br />I enjoyed this very-readable book...but I also didn't expect it to be documented historical fact. If read with a light heart and a spirit of fiction, this is a terrific read.	2003-06-18

While I always enjoy historical fiction in a series, the second installment rarely 'grabs' my attention as much as the the first one did. This book, however, is an exception. I was captivated right from the start, and enjoyed every moment of reading &quot;Don't Look Back&quot;. I am thrilled to discover there is a 3rd book, and can't wait to begin that one.<br />That said, I am still confused as to what exactly &quot;mesmerism&quot; is. Because it is discussed so much in both novels, I had expected there to be a more thorough explanation, especially since the idea is so central to the story. Since it's not a commonly used term, and since there isn't much information on the topic, I believe that Ms. Quick should have included more than just passing references to this archaic science. I believe I would have enjoyed the novel even more if this point had been clearer.<br />Regardless, this is a delightful book, but I'd certainly recommend reading &quot;Slightly Shady&quot; before beginning this one.	2003-05-22

Now that I've grown accustomed to Jude Devereux's 'new style', I must say that I am truly enjoying her latest books. Initially, her leap from historical romance to contemporary mystery was difficult for me, but with each new novel, she clearly becomes more proficient at this type of storytelling, and I have become more involved in the new genre. <br />In any case, &quot;Wild Orchids&quot; is a terrific, page turning, interesting novel. The chapters alternate between the male and female protagonist's point of view, in a &quot;he said&quot;, &quot;she said&quot; format. While this can be confusing in some books, Ms. Devereux makes the first person character transitions so flawlessly, and so adeptly, that as the reader learns one character's point of view, you can't wait for the next chapter to see how the other one is going to view the same event.<br />&quot;Wild Orchids&quot; involves love, suspense, mystery, and an inkling of the supernatural. It's a page turning novel, with flawed, but likable characters. It certainly is the best book I've read in quite some time. I am certain that this is a novel that will please both Jude Devereux fans and mystery fans alike.	2003-04-30

I have been an enormous fan of Ms. Small's for nearly 20 years and have followed the exploits of the O'Malley and Leslie families with exhuberance. Unfortunately, I felt this book was very disjointed and inconsistant.<br />The three heroines were clearly 'labeled' at the beginning: the 'sad one', the 'nice one' and the 'spoiled one'. However, none of them bore any resemblance to their given labels. All seemed very shallow and very much alike. I was disappointed at how one-dimensional these characters were. It's very much unlike Ms. Small's usual captivating writing style.<br />If you have read the whole O'Malley series, then it does make sense to have some closure with this book, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to a first time Bertrice Small reader.	2003-04-02

Susan Wilson's lovely descriptions of the New England coastline are remarkable, but more remarkable still are the characters she's developed. Each chapter focuses on the point of view of a character. Everyone has seen the same events, but processes it differently. By exploring the events in this way, we get a full picture of the entire story.<br />This is a beautiful love story, an amazing look at New England coastal life, and a history lesson all rolled into one. I can't recommend this book highly enough.	2003-03-27

The characters are meaningful, and New York, itself, becomes a character in the story. The fanciful, mystical qualities may be suprising, but they, in no way, detract from the wonder of the story's theme. If anything, I appreciated the diversity of cultures in 'sharing' the magic.<br />That said, the reason I gave this book 4 stars, as opposed to 5, is simple: the writing style changed too abruptly between the &quot;past&quot; and &quot;present&quot;. The beauty of language in the first half of the book is completely lost in the second half. The use of present tense may make sense from a storytelling standpoint, but the writing itself loses cohesiveness. It's almost as if two different authors worked on this book, as a result. The story would have had no less impact if the writing style had remained consistent through the book. I felt that the characters became more difficult to understand and it became more difficult to read. Additionally, it would have been great fun to have included reproductions of maps as an appendix. I know NY fairly well, but would have found the story easier to follow (especially in NY's early days) had I known where now-forgotten streets and areas were.<br />All that aside, &quot;Forever&quot; is still a remarkable book. It's a captivating tale that celebrates the diversity of a truly American city and makes the reader celebrate the melting pot of our nation.	2003-02-11

Since other reviewers have given the synopses of this collection, I'll merely add to their echoes of praise for &quot;Tapestry&quot;. This is truly a wonderful group of novellas. Often, in these collections, the stories lack similarity and are difficult to read. Not so, with these tales. All blend together to make a lovely 'tapestry' for the reader to discover.<br />That said, I believe &quot;Dragonswan&quot; by Sherilyn Kenyon, was the weakest of the four novellas. Though it was fun to read along with the rest of the collection, it lacked the 'weight' the other stories held. Additionally, it came across as a bit absurd. It was still enjoyable, especially when reading other similar tales, but left on its own, &quot;Dragonswan&quot; wouldn't have flown. This is the only reason why I felt the collection was not due five stars, instead of four.<br />Regardless of the one weaker story, this is lovely book and enjoyable to read.	2002-10-18

This is a very entertaining book, but it's such a departure from Ms. Deveraux's usual style that I had to keep checking the front cover to make certain I was reading the correct author's name. \\"Forever\\" is written very much in the genre of Marion Zimmer Bradley's 'light' Trilogy (\\"Ghostlight\\", \\"Heartlight\\" and \\"Witchlight\\"). There are evil witches, charming innocents, poor souls who are sacrificed to evil and a hero who must help an innocent piece the puzzle together. <br />I enjoyed reading this book very much, but I enjoy reading a variety of genres in literature. For those of you who prefer the traditional Jude Deveraux romance, even with a little supernatural thrown in, this *may* not be the book for you. The thoughts of mutilations and other truly evil images are harsh and scary, in a grown up Harry Potter sort of way. If these ideas are disturbing to you, then this is a book worth skipping.<br />My one point of curiousity is regarding Ms. Deveraux's seemingly 'jumping' style in her writing. This book is a horror/fantasy. Her last book, \\"The Mulberry Tree\\", was a murder mystery. I get the feeling she's bored with the romance genre and is stretching her wings towards other styles. Her warmth and humor do shine through, but I must say, this isn't a book I would have bought had it not had Ms. Deveraux's name on the cover. That isn't to say I'm disappointed that I read it...just that it involved a topic I wouldn't have sought out.	2002-10-10

I truly felt a part of the story and felt that I was a part of the characters' lives. I felt the characters' personality flaws deeply and on a very personal level. I enjoyed &quot;watching&quot; the relationships grow and change, just as the characters themselves grew and changed. I felt moved by the flawed, complicated, but deep relationship shared between Rose and Anna.<br />&quot;Flight Lessons&quot; also had another side effect---it made me want to own my own restaurant ! In all seriousness, this is a lovely book. I look forward to reading more books by this author.	2002-08-26

This somewhat confusing, but fairly enjoyable book is not Dodd's best. I have loved so many of Christina Dodd's books and this one seemed to lack the punch of her other works. The beginning is very slow and if I hadn't been *positive* the story would improve, I simply wouldn't have continued reading. That said, it did get better as it went along, and I was very glad that I 'stuck with it' and didn't give up.<br />Quite honestly, this seemed to be a mix of an amnesia story and &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;.  If you enjoyed the premise behind the movie of &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, you will most likely enjoy this book. The characters, however, were not as fully developed as most Christina Dodd's characters generally are. However, with a lot of imagination, you can make this story one worth reading.<br />I would recommend this book to others, but with the caveat that they should read other Christina Dodd books first.

While this book lacks the rolicking humor in her previous books, it's still a light and enjoyable read. The story is told well, and I appreciated the premise of the book...a handsome stranger whisks off unwilling brides before they must make unhappy marriages. <br />That said, I did find Eric Landsdowne to be a character of contrasts. He seems very much the &quot;love them and leave them&quot; rake, and yet, he rescues young women from desperate fates. The main character of Samantha Briggeham is delightful. It's nice to know that an intelligent woman *can* get Prince Charming in the end !<br />I do recommend this book, but I would recommend previous titles by the same author above this one.

I adore Christina Dodd's books, and I've enjoyed every one of them. This one made me laugh and feel poor Jane's humiliation, while still falling in love with Blackburn.<br />That said, I did think it took too long to 'get the plot going'. Because I have read many of Christina Dodd's books, I knew to hang in there. I was very glad I'd kept reading because the book took off about halfway through. However, I wouldn't recommend this for one's first Christina Dodd book.	2002-03-12

Like other readers, this is the first Kinley MacGregor book I'd read and it certainly won't be the last. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters in this story and can only hope that Ms. MacGregor will expand upon each of them. There are so many wonderful tales begun in this book, with so many memorable characters, I'd love to read a book for each of them.<br />The story of Morgan and Serenity is a dynamic one and was enjoyable, humorous, heart warming and captivating. But, I'm hopeful that someday we can also read the tales for Kristen and her husband, George, as well as Serenity's sister, Charity. <br />This is definitely not a book to be missed !	2002-03-09

While I had a wonderful time revisiting familiar characters (Charles Stuart and the rest of the Leslie family) and places (Brae and Glenkirk), I felt this book was very flat overall. The characters of Flanna and Patrick were unlikeable and very &quot;canned&quot;. The story seemed forced, and while it was enjoyable to continue on with Skye's legacy and Jasmine's family, I felt this book was fairly lackluster.<br />If you have already read the other books in this series, this one is worth it, simply to keep up with the goings-on. However, I wouldn't recommend this book to a first-time Betrice Small reader. It's much better to start out Skye O'Malley or Wild Jasmine.<br />I am hopeful that Ms. Small's next installment will pack more punch !	2002-02-13

If you know something of  Lynn Kurland's work, you know that many of her heroines (and a couple of heros !) find themselves in amazing, unbelievable time travel situations. This book is no different ! It's a fun book to read and her characters make an unbelievable situation quite believable. <br />The only reason I'm not giving it four stars is that I found the book had a very slow beginning in terms of the development of the  characters of Richard &amp; Jessica.

However, I found this one to be beyond the scope of what I could &quot;take&quot; in terms of tragedy befalling a heroine. Gillian's abuse was so gruesome and so unsettling that I found the whole book was very difficult to 'take'. Many romance novels have a theme of &quot;triumph &amp; love over adversity&quot;, but I felt this one simply went too far.<br />While I appreciated the happy ending, it didn't make up for the deep sorrow and fear I felt in reading this book.

I love Lynn Kurland's books but this one left me feeling disappointed. I honestly think this was a waste of my money and time. Her short story &quot;The Icing on the Cake&quot; was, by far, the weakest in the group. The characters were flat and the situation unbelievable---even for this reader who likes time travel romance ! Sydney and Sam just didn't seem the type to fall in love, and the character of Sam (and her life story) was especially far-fetched.  <br />The other short stories were mildly entertaining but certainly the whole book was waste of time.

I'm a homeschool teacher and a former public school teacher, but found this book to be a great disappointment. I found the implementation to be difficult and disagree vehemently with some of the author's suggestions. For example, the author doesn't recommend reading or writing independently until the child has mastered a high level of mastery. In my experience, this is counterproductive to teaching a love of reading and writing. There are other phonics programs on the market that are far simpler and work much better. I'd urge homeschoolers, or other parents, to find a different method.	2001-12-31

While one must always check facts at the door when reading time travel romance, this one was both romantic and altruistic. You *wanted* to believe that this was possible ! <br />I enjoyed the main characters of Francine and Garrick very much. Their verbal sparring, their profound attraction towards one another and their day to day life in medieval times was great fun to read. I especially enjoyed the completely surprising twist at the end of this book. I was most certainly not expecting it !<br />That said, I was thoroughly confused by the characters of Anne and Raphael.

This book is a fun, entertaining and engaging read, but lacks the 'pop' of the first two books by Karen Marie Moning, &quot;Beyond the Highland Mist&quot; and &quot;To Tame a Highlander&quot;. The reappearance of the character of fairy &quot;fool&quot; Adam Black was fun, and there was definitely a twist to his character I hadn't expected, that I also found to be entertaining.<br />Unfortunately, the character of Lisa was just not as likeable a heroine as Adrienne and Jillian were (from the first two books), nor did I understand the mind reading ability that seemed to be 'plunked' into the book. Circenn was as seductively attractive and fascinating as the other heros, but he, too, seemed to pale in comparison to Grimm and Hawk.<br />I truly did enjoy this book on a fun, light hearted level.

My only sorrow is that it doesn't appear that the wonderful character of Quinn de Moncreiffe will have HIS own story told. I am hopeful that Karen Marie Moning will bring Quinn back in a tale of his own. He was such a phenomenal character and friend to Grimm (as Grimm was to Hawk), that I'm hopeful we can read Quinn's love story at some point too.	2001-09-21

Even though I found the beginning to be a bit slow, the pace did pick up and I was so happy that I &quot;stuck&quot; with it.

I, myself, am blessed with a mother-in-law who is the 'mother I always wanted', so this particular character direction truly touched my heart. I also found myself dreamily imagining that love *can* cross all bounds of time and space.<br />The fairy aspect was a bit harder to believe for me than the time travel aspect, but it didn't detract from this being an enjoyable book. I was a bit worried it be too 'science fiction' for me, but this book was truly a romantic adventure.<br />This was the first book by Karen Marie Moning I'd read but I've ordered the rest of her books in this series because I had so much fun with this one !	2001-09-18

It gave a more realistic and understandable feel to their characters and also made it all the more romantic that they discovered eachother. Another aspect of their relationship I enjoyed was how much they had in common.

While it lacked the &quot;Zip&quot; of &quot;Son of the Morning&quot; or the Mackenzie saga, I have to tell you that it is quite enjoyable to curl up with a mug of hot cocoa, a roaring fire and this book. <br />Reese and Madelyn are likeable, but flawed, characters. I actually found Reese to be a bit more &quot;believable&quot; than Madelyn, which is why I'm only giving this book 4 stars. Madelyn is certainly affable, but there is a sense of her having it just &quot;too easy&quot; until Reese comes into her life. I do enjoy her independent spirit, but think her buying the Ranch did put the story into the realm of &quot;well, that was just too easy&quot;.<br />That said, it's fun book and certainly one that any Linda Howard fan would enjoy.	2001-09-06

I am a huge Betrice Small fan, and many of her books have been so re-read by me that the bindings have broken. Her books are generally full of passion, historical suspense and strong, independent minded heriones.<br />While this book mimics her usual genre, I can't say that this fan is impressed. I found the book predictable and actually fairly dull. That said, it was still an enjoyable read for a 'at the beach in the summer' book, though not one I'd recommend to a first time Bertrice Small reader.

As a former public school teacher, and now a homeschool parent, I can honestly say I've seen a great deal of art curriculum materials. This book stands hand and shoulders above the rest in terms of what it attempts to cover and the way it brings the great artistic styles into undestandable terms for children and their educators. <br />My only complaint (and what's kept me from giving this book 5 Stars) is that the black &amp; white photocopies of pictures show so little detail of each artist. You really need to have a good full color guide to the world of art (showing at least one major work from each artist) to be able to use this curriculum effectively. <br />My hope is that the authors will consider this for future printings. If they do so, I think this will be the perfect art curriculum to teach both hands on art and art history.	2001-07-03

I hadn't realized this book was one of a series of futuristic books, and perhaps that caused some of my confusion. However, I've been a big fan of Johanna Lindsay's other books---dating all the way back to reading &quot;The Windflower&quot; in college ! <br />I found this book to be confusing and the use of language was just too 'contrived'. The wise-cracking Martha (a &quot;HAL&quot; type computer&quot;) was annoying and even main character, Brittany's dialogue seemed to 'pushed' into 'hip' speech. <br />The story simply didn't flow well, the 'attempts' at jocularity for dialogue seemed 'forced' and the entire story was just a grand disappointment.<br />While I haven't read other science fiction, I am not 'against' it as a genre. I just didn't think this particular book had that special magic so prevalent in so many Johanna Lindsay books. Take my advice...re-read anything in her 'set in the west' novels (like &quot;Angel&quot; or &quot;Savage Thunder&quot;) or her regency novels. Don't bother with this one !	2001-05-20

I felt a great deal of anger and bitterness in the first half...so much so, that I almost put the book down forever. I found the characters to be, initially, flat and unlikeable. I also found the level of hostility in the book to be initially so unsettling that I didn't want to waste my time with it !<br />I have never been a fan of the &quot;men are horrible and I hate my life&quot; middle aged woman's battle cry in contemporary literature. As a matter of fact, one of the reasons why I have loved Jude Devereux's books is that they have stayed away from this angst and hostility. The beginning of &quot;The Summerhouse&quot; made me wonder if the author had recently gone through a bitter divorce herself, or had dear friends that had one so---so apparent was her writing from this perspective. This level of hostility made me want to run from this book in horror !<br />However, as I forced myself to keep reading (from no motivation other than I'd invested in the hardcover version), I did begin to truly enjoy the last part of the book. The last 75 pages were the best part of the entire novel and I read them voraciously. I especially enjoyed how different each of the three women's 'decisions' were, and how each one's life was changed for the better. I only wish that I had been able to like, or at the very least, identify with, the characters before those last loose ends were tied up.<br />It is not as depressing a book as I'd initially feared, but nor is it one I'd recommend in favor of books like &quot;Legend&quot; (my all time favorite Jude Devereux book), &quot;Sweet Liar&quot; or &quot;A Knight in Shining Armor&quot;.	2001-05-15

I have loved SIMPLE ABUNDANCE, Sarah Ban Breathnach's preceeding book, with a passion. She inspired me, uplifted me and helped me through a sad chapter in my life with her book. Unfortunately, just as Simple Abunandance lifted me up, I found SOMETHING MORE to be depressing, angry and very disjointed. I had a hard time following the author's train of thought. Was she expressing spiritual insights ?  Where was she taking all these anecdotes ? Did she have a POINT ?<br />I realize that no one book is going to have all the  answers for all people, but I have found this book to start down many fascinating paths, but explore none of them. I also found that the author's divorce was clearly reflected in the way she wrote this book. I heard a lot of anger and bitterness, which while understandable in a grieving woman, is unattractive and difficult to read in a book that's meant to inspire and uplift.<br />One particular anecdote involved a terrible tragedy befalling a family's loss of 6 year old daughter. I found the description of this to be profoundly peculiar and in very poor taste. I was struck somewhere between feeling deep empathy for a young mother in crisis and being disgusted by some make-believe rituals prior to burial. <br />I found there to be a few thought provoking chapters but overall, I simply didn't care for this book. I did find her title appropriate---this book left me wanting SOMETHING MORE !	2001-04-02

This book has been incredibly helpful, easy to read and fascinating for our family. It's written from a Christian, Providential perspective, and  shows how clearly the Christian roots in our nation are founded. I'd  recommend it to anyone looking for a more traditional view of American  history, as opposed to the newer, 'watered down and dumbed down' textbooks  on the market today.	2000-09-19

I began this book by borrowing it from a friend during a day at the  beach...she didn't mind if I read the first few chapters but did want it  back. I simply couldn't put it down and she had a hard time wrestling it  away from me ! :-) In all seriousness, this is intellectual treat, a  thriller, and truly a page turner. But, make sure you have a friend who has  also read it---you're going to want to talk about it with someone when  you're finished !	2000-08-24

I adored this book---it's actually the first Bertrice Small book I ever  read--and it was many years ago. I recently picked it up again re-read it.  I couldn't believe that I enjoyed this book as much a decade later, as I  had when I'd first read it. I especially enjoyed seeing the 'beginnings' of  the Leslie saga ! One of my favorite elements in Bertrice Small's books are  her use of Sagas, and familiar characters. As much as I love the O'Malley  tales, the Leslies of Glenkirk have a special place in my heart. This book  is a delightful read...enjoy it !	2000-08-19

So, when Bertrice Small writes using characters *not* from this illustrious  family, I read with a sense of apprehension. However, this time I was so  captivated by the story, the characters and the period in history, reading  this book was truly a joy ! My only regret was the book ending---I wanted  to know what happens NEXT !	2000-08-15

It was not romantic at all, and I found  myself skipping over more and more just to find something 'more' happening  in the story. A LADY'S PLEASURE was definitely my favorite story, too, as  with so many of the other readers. I wish that Robin Schone had expanded  this into a full novel ! But, if you're buying this book JUST to read  Bertice Small's work, I'd skip it and re-read Skye O'Malley instead !	2000-08-08

I read this book about 15 years ago, and to this day, it's the best historical fiction/romance I've ever read. I truly enjoyed it, and would love to re-read  it. If only it were still in print !  The author, by the  way, is Johanna Lindsey. I am surprised to see her name not listed, as  she's a very popular &amp; successful writer !	2000-07-28

I have read *all* of Ms. Small's books, and they've been a wonderful treat for me. Of course, I have a special place in my heart for the Skye O'Malley series, so I tend to read non-Skye related books a bit apprehensively. This  book quickly became my all time favorite ! <br />Do yourself a treat---make a  hot cup of tea, curl into a comfy chair and read this book in one LONG  stretch ! Enjoy !	2000-07-26
US	52692952	R35QV7GOX68NPP	0671695304	406487710	Forever	Books	1	35	61	N	N	This book is not appropriate for most teens..	I feel very sad when writing the review for this book. I can remember being an impressionable, and curious teen, when this book was placed in my hands some 20 years ago. I can tell you that many young women I knew became  sexually active at a very young age, due in large part to this book. It  made sex seem 'hip' and 'cool'. The saddest part of all is what this book  says about our culture...which has cheapened a beautiful act between a  husband and wife into a poor imitation.<br />I would not recommend this book  to any teen, especially ones who lack parental involvement in their lives.  I believe that all parents should pre-read this book before allowing their  teens to do so.	2000-07-06

I cannot possibly share the joy of learning that Five In A Row has brought to our family in just  a few words. Having taught in public schools for five years, and now as a home educator to my own children, I can easily say  that this is a highly engaging, academically challenging and yet gentle  program. The non-instrusive method may seem simplistic to some, but when  you begin to use the method and concepts, you realize the genius of Jane  Lambert's ideas. My 4 year old impressed a dear friend (who is a former  Talented and Gifted director for two public school systems) with her vast  knowledge of geography and language arts. The interesting thing is that my  daughter didn't join us for all the lessons...this was a program I was  focusing on with her 6 year old brother, who showed incredible retention  &amp; love of learning, as well.<br />Five In A Row is very special because it  doesn't use 'twaddle' for books, but high quality, classic children's  literature, in addition to the best of newer titles. While other children  may be being &quot;fed&quot; on Disney books, or other dribble, Five In A  Row is nurturing a love of true literature in the children who use it...and  in their parents.<br />I recommend Five In A Row for all new homeschoolers, or  for anyone wanting to do some extras with their children that attend  school.	2000-06-20

As a mother, a home educator and a former public school teacher, I have always loved having Jan Brett's books around. They're lively, they inspire  children to look for detail and they entertain in a wholesome manner. When  we saw this book at the library, I immediately had to come home and order  one for us. I never thought I'd have a new favorite, besides the Mitten,  but this one may be it ! :-)	1999-10-28

As far as I know, there are only the three..Brave the Wild Wind, Savage Thunder and Angel...I love the way that Angel wraps up all three. This is a  great book, and one I had an impossible time putting down. You won't be  disappointed !	1999-06-04

I am a big fan of Kate Waters' books, &quot;Samuel Eaton's Day&quot; and &quot;Sarah Morton's Day&quot;. It was with great excitement that I found this book to accompany them !  All too many books about the pilgrims either  portray them as &quot;Evil bigots&quot; or as the glossed over  &quot;wouldn't it be fun to be a  pilgrim ?&quot; portrayal. I enjoy all of  these books because they give an accurate, historical representation of the  times. ON THE MAYFLOWER, in particular, gives both a peek into the day to  day living on board the ship, as well as the view as seen from a child's  perspective.  I highly reccomend this book !	1998-11-13

We are big fans of Kate Waters' books about the Pilgrims (Samuel Eaton's Day, Sarah Morton's Day and On the Mayflower). When we discovered  &quot;Tapenum's Day&quot;, we were thrilled !  I found the 'point of view'  from a young Native American boy to be both fascinating and educational, as  did my children. We enjoyed seeing this historically accuate slice of life,  written from a balanced perspective. I think this wonderful book rounds out  the collection, including the other four, that no study of the Pilgrims  should be without.	1998-11-13

While I had only read the first of this series (Ghostlight) I easily picked up who the characters were and enjoyed getting to know each of them, especially 'meeting' Thorne Blackburn (from  Ghostlight) in the time set before the novel in which he was the focus.   This book is not one to pick up and set down, but one that will captivate  and enthrall you, as well as expand your thinking about the scope of good  and evil in the world.	1998-10-27

The Mists of Avalon is a book I have returned to again and again over the  years. I read the book for the first time more than 14 years ago, when I  was still in college, and it captured my interest and facination then.  Having re-read easily a dozen times, I am drawn to a new facet or twist  every time, and I come away with a new one of MZB's amazing life lessons  each 'visit'. For me, the traditional Arthurian legend was intriguing  enough but now the new telling has so-replaced the stereotyped characters  of old in my mind, that I have a hard time listening or reading to the  biased original tale anymore. This is a long book, but one that is  virtually impossible to put down. Once you are through, you find yourself  still 'reliving' each moment in your mind. I cannot recommend it highly  enough.	1998-10-11

I enjoyed Ghostlight very much...but I enjoyed reading Heartlight, which  was written later but set earlier (a common occurance in MZB books, I think  !) even more so !  I think that I would have enjoyed Ghostlight even more  if I'd known 'the rest of the story' as ahead of time. As with all the  books in this series, you must feel comfortable with MZB's acceptance and  usage of occult terms. Overall, this is a page turner of a book, a  wonderful read for a 'cozy night' and gives the reader food for thought  regarding the occult world.	1998-10-11

I have already re-read three times...and unable to put it down between readings !<br />Fiona Hay is a woman between a rock and a hard place throughout her life, doing her duty by her sisters, and to uphold her own honor. She makes mistakes, learns from them and is rewarded by being loved by the two most magnificent men one can possibly imagine. Interestingly enough, I enjoyed the character of Colin MacDonald even more than Black Angus Gordon...what a dynamic, rich character he is !<br />If you want to be swept up in medieval Scotland, and experience first hand of the 'taming' of the wild northern clans, then &quot;Betrayed&quot; will captivate you completely !	1998-06-28

Bronwyn MacArran and Stephen Montgomery sizzle up the pages of this enthralling book, the 2nd in the wonderful Montgomery series. As you read this book, you will transported back to Medieval Scotland, with all the passion, all the poverty and all the  love you can possible imagine. I do recommend reading the series IN ORDER, so do read The Velvet Promise first....then enjoy the two to follow. All four are intertwined in such a way that it almost feels like one large, wonderful novel.	1998-06-07
