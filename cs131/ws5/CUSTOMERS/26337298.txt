US	26337298	R14G88YB6FXLA1	141373278X	504526579	Fire in the Ice	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Explosive Read	<br />Josh wants Deedra for his own, Deedra has had enough of love having lost her parents and then her husband. She never wants to feel the pain of losing someone again. However, it is difficult to say no to the dynamic and sexy cattle rancher. Deedra finds herself falling for this sensual,bold and so very exciting Josh. She builds walls, he tears them down, she rebuilds... They are thrust in to dilemmas, just when you think its going to work out it doesn't, then the unthinkable happens. I could not put this novel down, it is that exciting and the story moves so wonderfully. My favorite part though...is when Deedra realizes the man she had dreams of as a teenager, is none other than Josh himself. That was a cool concept, and brought all the little tid bits Katlyn Stewart hid throughout the book in to full focus. I will look for more of her work.  <br /> <br />Also recommended: Full Bloom, Impossible, Superstition	2005-05-04

But, in this case I found Nightmares Echo through a different review and bought it. There is no brilliant prose to this book, the Author does not carry you away with wonderful words that you have to research in a dictionary. What it is-is Heartfelt writing. The emotions are raw and beautiful. The story is genuine. She does get to gorry, but allows you to understand the pain and distress of being a child of abuse. This author also shows you how to climb up and out of the dungeons of life and begin a life anew. I usually tend to lean toward books such as Secret Life Of Bees or Three Junes. Something a bit fictitious but with a story to tell. This book, Nightmares Echo-tells the story, and teaches you not to judge until you are in someone elses shoes. I would love to have given this book 10 stars, but unfortunately the rating only goes to 5!	2004-06-14
