A classical education, judging from this book, would seem to be a \\"Christian, Western\\" education.  If Wise's approach is a \\"classical\\" approach, perhaps this explains why many even educated Americans have never heard of many non-Western civilizations and their accomplishments, even those that lasted hundreds of years, even millenia.  <br />The classical child gets a very heavy education in the liberal arts with not as much emphasis in the sciences. Similarly, the authors' approach to mathematics is pedantic, pedestrian, and traditionally uninspiring.  And the authors make some silly statements, such as asserting that children are unable to understand abstract concepts before fifth grade.<br />To conclude:  it's a good how-to guide when it comes to organization. For substantive content, look elsewhere (Rebecca Rupp's resource guide is not as well organized, but the materials are broader, and she's got more science/math resources).	2004-07-08

The text is easy to read and fluid and is the standard accepted scholarly biography of Muhammad's life. (This is not a revisionist religious studies discussion, after all, and she's not pushing any envelopes.)  <br />Demi's tone is not reverent, but respectful and considerate.  The review from School Library Journal above reveals more about the author's prejudices than this book's biases:  she says that Muslims weren't supposed to be friends with Jews and Christians, but the Jews and Christians to whom the Qur'an refers were the ones persecuting the early Muslims in 7th century Arabia.  The reviewer neglects to mention that the Qur'an also says that Muslims can MARRY Jews and Christians because of their elevated status in Islam (Jews and Christians are called \\"People of an Earlier Revelation\\").<br />Demi, on the other hand, has adopted a very appropriate tone for this book. In a children's book about Jesus or Moses or Krishna, I would want to see a respectful narrative tone, as well.<br />Highly recommended for both children and adults -- a lovely way to get to know something about the 2nd largest religion in the world.	2003-09-26

I thought it was very accurate, by the way; Islam does not require fasting until a person is past puberty. Fasting is required only for healthy adults (not the sick, pregnant, traveling, elderly, etc.), so -- although some Muslim children do enthusiastically try out a fast or two before puberty -- it's not a requirement and is not common.  So I think this book was informative, representative of the Muslim experience, and empathetic.  Recommended.	2002-11-15

The only problem is that one gets the impression that Muslim children are supposed to fast during Ramadan, and that's not the case - fasting is only required for healthy adults (that's defined as past puberty or when you've stopped growing).  Otherwise, it's a beautiful book, with lots of basic information about Islam, as well.  Highly recommend!	2002-11-05

Stephen Humphreys is one the HUGE names in Islamic history, and extremely well-respected academician at the University of California.  His book is readable and unbiased.  It portrays an intelligent picture of that part of the world that is still perceived very strangely by the many people outside it.  (By the way, the previous reviewer, Daniel Pipes, is part of the same organization as Martin Kramer, who advocated removal of funding for Middle East Studies Programs.  Pipes himself has just set up a McCarthyan website in which he keeps \\"dossiers\\" of any professors who might be sympathetic toward Islam and the Middle East and in which he urges students to report others.  He's hardly objective.)      So much of what's going on in the Middle East today is the result of recent history, and it's important to understand that history for any kind of modern understanding.  This book discusses the politics, economics, social tensions, and religious issues that shape the character of the Middle East. Very recommended for anyone who wants to understand what's going on there and how -- increasingly -- it will affect us in the Western world.	2002-10-13

He runs into all kinds of linguistic problems when he teaches the Qur'an as part of Haverford's comparative religions program.  This book is his way of trying to get around those linguistic problems.  It is not the entire Qur'an -- he takes those verses that are representative of the Qur'an and analyzes them in detail, giving us tools to analyze them in detail ourselves.  The Qur'an was totally incomprehensible to me until I read this book.<br />For those insistng that this book is not representative of the Qur'an because it doesn't include any fighting verses (that's the view of the Christian fundamentalists suing UNC), it's useful to remember that only about 47 of 6,236 Qur'anic verses urge fighting.  That's less than 1 percent of the Qur'an, and thereore hardly representative.  I had to read the Bible as a freshman, and we didn't discuss the violent passages in the Bible (of which there are many).  And if some Muslims have based violent actions on the Qur'an, just as many non-Muslims, like the Ku Klux Klan, Timothy McVeigh, David Coresh, the instigators of the Jonestown massacres, and people who blow up abortion clinics all base their actions on the Bible.  That's not even taking into account the Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition.	2002-10-07

In this book, he explains the entire mythology of Islam that exists in the West and why it's there, pointing out that the media uses \\"Islam\\" to mean every thing from Morocco to India to Palestine to Saudi Arabia to Nigeria to the Gulf. He takes not only general themes but specific examples to show how the media manipulates everything we perceive about Islam.  For example, Said points out that when the Iranians defended themselves against Iraq's invasion of Iran in 1980 (something we all should be able to understand) the media characterized the Iranians as indulging \\"the Shi'a penchant for martyrdom,\\" immediately portraying a country defending itself as something alien and negative.  He tells us how unprepared the media is, too; of the 300 reporters in Iran during the hostage crisis, for example, not one spoke Farsi. How can we possibly get an accurate idea of what's going on if we don't even know the language?    Even if you just read the introduction, this book is worth getting.

(Third Edition)	Books	5	56	72	N	N	Balanced and Objective	I can't believe that many of those reviewing this book actually read it. For one thing, they miss the whole point of this book, which is this:  though of course there are wackos out there like bin Laden, Islam does not sanction them.  The attack on the Twin Towers was not \\"Islamic,\\" as people persist in believing, any more than McVeigh's attack in Oklahoma City was Christian, even though McVeigh acted in the name of the Christian Identity Christian fundamentalist group and was raised a Catholic.<br />The author is trying to put things in perspective -- we do not view people who base their violent actions on the Bible (like the Ku Klux Klan) as representative of Christianity, so why do we view terrorists who base their violent actions on the Qur'an as representative of Islam?  <br />For people who wish to stay secure in their stereotypes of Islam, this book will not be useful.  But Esposito, a Catholic and a professor of Islamic Studies at Georgetown, has no pro-Islamic agenda.  It's his academic field.  And he tries to put the record straight and explain the Islamic world in this book.  <br />(Simply the fact that Saudi Arabia is described by some reviewers as a \\"moderate\\" Islamic state when its version of Islam is actually an extremist fundamentalist one clearly shows the total lack of understanding that most people have of the Islamic world.)<br />Do yourself a favor and get this book.  It tries to clarify the media stereotypes, tries to foster understanding, is not pro-Islam (it's actually more critical of Islam than Muslims might wish), and is extremely balanced and objective.  It presents a bigger picture, and if you truly want to educate yourself about the world with respect to Islam, then this is a great book.	2002-09-08

He's also a consultant to the State Department, which means he's politically knowledgeable.  His books are not only level-headed and impartial, they're knowledgeable -- he has a Ph.D. in Islamic studies, which is more than the authors of most of the sensationalist books on Islam on the market at the moment.  He really has no agenda except (as obvious) to promote understanding between religions.  <br />Given that, it's refreshing to read this book.  It gives the background of why people like bin Laden exist (he doesn't excuse them -- he just tells us why they exist), gives the Islamic doctrine of jihad (which, despite people who throw the term around indiscriminately, means a defensive war under certain limited conditions), and tries to explain how the doctrine of jihad is being misused.  People who refer to the \\"real meaning of jihad\\" as what happened on 9/11 are simply displaying ignorance and a resistance to becoming informed.  <br />Dealing with 9/11 means dealing with the complex morass of issues that provoked it.  Esposito helps us understand some of those issues.  He also provides a glossary in the back for Arabic terms that the media has no trouble using as if they know what they mean (such as shari'a).  <br />The media distorts Islam so out of proportion that any attempt to correct inaccuracies is denounced as \\"whitewashing.\\"  Esposito does not whitewash.  He tries to explain and promote understanding.  He is not pro-Islam. In fact, he's not pro-anybody.  He states facts and he doesn't explain everything in terms of good-guy/bad-guy, white/black, good/evil. Although that is bound to make some people uncomfortable, the world is not black and white.<br />I highly recommend this book if you want to stop being manipulated by the media and to make a sincere attempt atunderstanding some of the turmoil in the world today.	2002-07-04

He said a colleague appraoched him and said, &quot;Sells, I get to the second surah and I just lose it.  I don't know what to make of it.  What do you teach?&quot;  <br />Prof. Sells said that the problem in translating the Qur'an comes from the huge grammatical differences between Arabic and English, the difficulty of translating poetry into another language, and the fact that the Qur'an has always been recited out loud. In English, he says, God in the Qur'an sounds angry, whereas in Arabic, God in the Qur'an sounds sad and compassionate.  That's a big difference.  Sells also says that the grammar in Arabic allows the tone of the Qur'an to achieve &quot;ultimate majesty&quot; at the same time as &quot;personal intimacy.&quot;  Because of the linguistic difference, that is very difficult to carry over into English.<br />Therefore, this book is Sells' attempt to get around these difficulties in accessing the Qu'ran.  He gives the translation of the surah and then he gives his commentary and explanation of it.  There's a CD in the back that has recitations in Arabic, so we can hear that it is poetry and it really does even rhyme and hear how the recited Qur'an can affect a person differently from the printed Qur'an.  Sells said, in his talk, that students have actually come up to him with tears in their eyes to tell him that they had previously never had any idea what the Qur'an was like.<br />Although this is not the entire translated Qur'an, this book will give you a far better idea of what the Qur'an means and what it sounds like and where it comes from than if you pick up a translation of the Qur'an (even one with footnotes) and try to read it and understand it cold.  (Many of us get glassy-eyed around the second surah.)  This book will give you a much better understanding of the Qur'an than a translation will because it not only explains the meaning of the Qur'anic text, its unique approach solves the problems that those of us who don't speak Arabic have in understanding its nature and its meaning.<br />Michael Sells said that whenever he's in Damascus, he sits on his rooftop at night and listens to the chanting of love poems drifing toward him from other rooftops, from all directions.  Some of that chanting is because Arabic love poems have been around for millennia.  But some of that chanting is practicing for the chanting of the poetry of the Qur'an.<br />That's what Michael Sells has tried to capture in &quot;Approaching the Qu'ran.&quot;	2002-05-19

I can get special occasion calories in any good cookbook and I didn't need them here. Also, the book is heavy on desserts, whereas there are not enough vegetable and fish recipes (not one spinach recipe!). <br />The author also doesn't give a nutritional breakdown (including calorie count and serving size) of her recipes, which is frustrating, because her whole philosophy revolves around splurging calories here and watching calories there and controlling portions. What kind of a book on losing weight and eating healthy does not even provide information on nutrition?  For someone who really doesn't have the vaguest notion of how to start eating healthy and exercising, this book may be a good start.

It illustrates the views of millions of Muslims that are never covered in the media or even by academicians.  The \\"Orientalist\\" view of Islam has been promoted with tiresome frequency in the media and in scholarship as though it represents all of Islam -- it doesn't.  This book gives a modern interpretation of Islam (that has nothing to do with terrorism) in a series of a short essays by Muslims and non-Muslims.  These are scholarly essays -- not just the unreasoned opinions of journalists who have been cashing in on 9/11 to spin out their own books as fast as they can -- but liberal interpretations of Islam based on original Islamic texts, by renowned academicians.  The interpretations of Islam in this book, though prevalent throughout the Islamic world, are usually neglected in the spotlight, eclipsed by juicier portrayals of extremists as representative of all Islam.  Thanks to Kurzman, these interpretations receive attention here, and show us that Islam is a modern, equitable religion -- one advocating religious tolerance, women's rights, and democracy --and practiced peacefully by millions.	2002-03-16

Yes, it's easy to read, but it's not the Qur'an.  Dawood not only leaves out a lot, he distorts the meaning.  Sometimes the verses are unrecognizable, so much so that I have to wonder if the distortion was deliberate (for example, in one verse, the exact same Arabic phrase is translated differently when it refers to men than when it refers to women).  He doesn't come close to capturing the poetic quality of the Qur'an (whatever your beliefs, in terms of literature it is an astounding work of poetry), and he doesn't even convey the meaning.<br />The best translation of the Qur'an is Muhammad Asad's \\"The Message of the Qur'an.\\"  It has really clear, understandable footnotes, and he spent years with the Bedouin Arabs to learn their language because it's the closest to the Qur'anic Arabic of 1400 years ago.  (Asad was a Jewish journalist who spent time in the Middle East and then converted to Islam.)<br />Another good book to start with is John Williams' \\"The Word of Islam\\" in which he uses verses of the Qur'an and intersperses them with his own explanatory commentary.<br />Whatever you do, don't get this one.	2002-02-14

It's written for Western readers and relates pretty well to the kinds of questions and preconconceptions the Western reader has about Islam.  It's not as easy to read as, say, \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Islam\\" (which is also not a bad starting place, actually) and it does require some concentration, but it is an in-depth analysis of Islamic principles without being so scholarly that it's totally inaccessible.  <br />One thing to note:  this is more a book on the academic and theoretical aspects of Islam, such as divine law, the Qur'an, Sunni vs. Shi'i Islam, etc.  It doesn't cover the day to day beliefs and practices of your average Muslim.

It's meant to be a companion to the PBS video \\"Islam: Empire of Faith.\\"  It covers the same time period (the first 1000 years of Islam), but doesn't have the same exact content as the video. There is some overlap, but not enough to make either the book or the video redundant.  This book is written by a husband-and-wife team of professors (historians) at Boston College.  This is not dry history, by any means, but a vivid description of Islam and its origins, practices, and political rule.  It's not sensationalist and/or imbued with the \\"Islam as Enemy Number One\\" mentality that pervades so many modern books about Islam (many of which are written by journalists or other people not qualified to be writing about Islam, Muslims (American or not) and the Muslim world in the first place).  It's just fascinating reading about the second largest religion in the world and how it built the most glittering civilization the world had ever seen.  The authors themselves say that to understand Islam today, we must focus not on the misdeeds committed by a few in its name, but \\"appreciate its glorious history and achievements.\\"  It doesn't have much on Islamic beliefs and practices or Islam and politics:  it really is mostly history.  But it's history that puts Islam (modern and past) into perspective and that will (hopefully) help us Westerners put some of myths about Islam finally to rest.	2002-01-28

The poetry and rhythm of the Qur'an is absent here, and Asad himself says that he makes no attempt to try to capture that at all.  So in reading this, realize that the real Qur'an is in unmetered verse, often rhyming, and thrilling in its accents.  But if you want the meaning of the verses, this is excellent.  It's modern, easy to read, reasonable and scholarly in its explanatory footnotes, and it makes more sense to the modern Western mind than any other translation.  In contrast to Dawood's translation (by far the worst), Asad tells you not only the meaning of the words, but the context, and the way the verse should be read against the background of the entire Qur'an.

This is a good introduction to the history of Islamic Civilization. It's fair and balanced. The lay reader may have difficulty sometimes in separating politics and religion in the world of Islam, but it is equally difficult to separate politics and religion in Christianity and Judaism, even today in some places, and certainly hundreds of years ago. Religion and politics have always mixed until recently -- take the Crusades, the Roman Empire, the Spanish Inquisition, for a few examples. The Muslims may have taken over a huge part of the world, but this is no different from the Roman empire taking over a huge part of the world. The Muslims were generally tolerant rulers.<br />But it's perfectly true that in the West we haven't had a clear picture of Islamic civilization. Partly it is because of the language. Partly it is because new tall tales were built on old tall tales -- people have always made up nasty stories about their enemies. Even into the 20th century, textbooks on Islam didn't even have their terminology correct. There have been many recent objective scholarly studies on Islam and the way it spread, but one scholar writes that it is still common for people in the West to take it for granted that Islam is a violent religion of the sword. This book represents the newer, more objective studies that work from original research and do not just base the information on the old tall tales.<br />Stereotypes in the West about Islam are so ingrained that any attempt to set out the facts in a straightforward, unbaised manner, as this book does, are viewed as &quot;whitewashing.&quot; The truth is that Islam has a better record than most in terms of religious tolerance. But we don't believe it. We think the Ottomans were intolerant and cruel, when in fact they were indifferent to local religions; they welcomed 50,000 Jews into the Ottoman Empire when Catholic Spain exiled them, and welcomed the Jews back to Jerusalem after the previous Christian rulers systematically banned them. The head of their army was traditionally Christian.<br />An example of this difficulty in seeing past the stereotypes is the reviewer who portrays Tamerlaine as the &quot;greatest Muslim conqueror of all.&quot; How could this be when Tamerlaine didn't follow the strict rules of war that Islam requires? When he didn't attack to spread Islam, but for power? Tamerlaine attacked Muslims as well as non-Muslims and treated Muslims as atrociously as he treated anyone else. In the scope of the history of the Muslim world, Tamerlaine was a power-hungry attacker who destroyed what Muslims and others had built and whose brief empire disintegrated after he died. THAT is why he doesn't get much treatment in this book. He just wasn't all that important. But in the West, he is unjustifiably immortalized because of Christopher Marlowe's play, in which Tamerlaine's exploits are luridly detailed and his deeds are considered &quot;Islamic&quot; because he claimed to be Muslim. Being piqued about Tamerlaine not being discussed much is like being piqued because Hitler isn't discussed much in an entire history of Christianity.<br />Anyway, ...If you want a good, fair, readable history of the Islamic world, edited by a scholar who grew up Catholic but who has a Ph.D. in Islamic Studies, then get this book.	2001-12-08

The reason this translation is attractive is that it's short and readable.  But it's not the Quran.  So if you want to understand what the Quran actually says, this is not the translation to get.  <br />So much of the Quran is incomprehensible to the lay reader (even the Arabic-speaking lay reader) that footnotes are really essential to make any sense of it.  For instance, the Quran sometimes just refers to historical figures or events but doesn't name names or go into details. Or, sometimes a verse may be in response to a specific circumstance that was taking place at the time (keep in mind that not one word of the Arabic Quran has been changed from the time it was first compiled 1400 years ago); the verse may no longer be applicable or it may have even been rendered obsolete by a later verse.  That sort of thing is impossible to know without footnotes, and Dawood not only leaves out explanations, sometimes he leaves out text that would have helped make sense of a passage.<br />I agree with other reviewers that Yusuf Ali is more accurate and even somewhat poetic.  It has good explanatory footnotes.  I probably prefer that one over any others, overall (I have a degree in Islamic studies and have five translations at home).  I like Arberry, too, in terms of style, but it's not as clear and concise as Yusuf Ali's version.  You might want to try John Alden Williams' &quot;The Word of God.&quot;  It's his own &quot;translation&quot; (the Quran can't really be translated!) of Quranic passages that are arranged as excerpts with Williams' straightforward explanations alternating between them.  I think it might be a better introduction to the Quran -- for someone not too familiar with it -- than reading the Quran itself (especially Dawood's version) cold.  Williams' book is short, too,  But if you want to go straight to the Quran, get the Yusuf Ali translation.  Avoid this one.	2001-12-04
US	53007991	R3VDTAQ30H4UI7	1851681299	849050750	Islam and the West: The Making of an Image	Books	5	12	16	N	N	Phenomenal	This is a remarkable work, detailing the perceptions of Islam prevalent in the West since the birth of Islam in the 7th century.  Daniel documents the medieval misconceptions and shows how they still exist in today's popular culture AND in modern scholarship.  He displays his proofs in the context of discussing the particulars of Islam and how they were perceived by the West.  I wish everyone would read this book.  It would considerably aid Muslim-Christian relations in the world and especially this country.	2001-09-29
US	53007991	RSFKO2014RJPH	0195130766	379364775	The Islamic Threat : Myth or Reality? (Third Edition)	Books	5	58	92	N	N	Even-handed and scholarly	This is one of the few books on Islam that I feel comfortable recommending to people. Dr. Esposito's sensible and unbiased discussions of issues relating to political Islam and Muslim-Christian-Jewish relations are informative and down-to-earth. Esposito writes elegantly and clearly, and from a wealth of education and experience (he's a Ph.D. in Islamic Studies, Director of the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown, and a consultant to the State Dept, for example). He paints the big picture, and tries to portray all sides of it. This is not an introduction to Islam. But it's profoundly helpful in understanding the confusing issues regarding Islam that are prevailing in the media and world today.	2001-08-06
US	53007991	R1FS1FIK9UP3V2	0449005666	695742653	Ticket to the Opera: Discovering and Exploring 100 Famous Works, History, Lore, and Singers, with Recommended Recordings	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Perfect introduction	This is the best introduction to opera that I've read. It covers all the major operas and, while easy to understand and humorous, is not overly simplistic and effusively jocular like &quot;Opera for Dummies.&quot;   Also, it's not as pompous as &quot;Opera 101.&quot;  The author doesn't  pretend to be a musicologist -- he simply gives you a wide array of views  from musicologists (as well as other people).  It's packed with information  and fun to either browse in or read straight through. I have extensive  musical training and my husband has absolutely none, but we both found this  book enjoyable and informative.	2000-07-19

It isn't for those unfamiliar with Islam, however. It does set forth some very satisfying and  well-supported views on the role of women in Islam, which -- contrary to  popular belief -- has never meant to be subservient or oppressed.  This is  a thoughtful and passionate discussion of women's rights in Islam, as well  as a defense of Islam as a proponent of women's rights.  Recommended,  either in this version or in the U.S. publication (the latter of which is  actually of much nicer material).	1999-10-15
