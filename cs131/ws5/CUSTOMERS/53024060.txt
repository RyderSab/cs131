I have never read any books by Cindy Blake before, but the synopses for Second Wives sounded interesting enough to give it try.  I was pleasantly surprised.  She's a good writer, and her story held my attention.  The story is about four sisters, two of whom are second wives, Meg and Amy; Leonora (Leo) who has just become involved with a married man (Nick); and Beth, the cynical single in their group.  Their mother is dead, as is a younger brother, and their father has always led a live of his own.  As Beth, Meg, and Amy try to help Leo see how she's throwing her life away on Nick, they each must deal with baggage in their own lives.  Meg's marriage is falling apart, Amy's first husband has arrived back in town and is turning her head, Beth is in love with a man she met at the age of 12, and has been following this hopeless dream for years, their father is trying to be involved in their lives, and lets not forget to throw in the ex's and step-children for a cauldron of trouble.	2001-01-19

At this time, Will Lee IV is in law school and not doing well scholarly.  He decides to take a year off and travel England and Ireland.  In the course of his travels, he meets up with a couple who sail and are in the process of building a boat for a reclusive businessman.  He joins them on their adventure which includes problems with terrorist.  I was disappointed in this book.  It's not the suspenseful, can't put down this book that most of Woods work is, and the book is more of a disappointment after reading Chiefs, the first book in the Lee series.	2000-10-30

Based on a true story about Eastern's Flight 401 that crashed in the  Everglades in 1972.  The book covers not only technical aspects of an  airplane disaster, but also covers the human side.  Sightings of the pilot,  Captain Bob Loft, and the flight engineer, Don Repo, on planes with  recycled parts of the doomed, 401 flight are reported by respected airline  crew members as well as passengers.  Eastern, of course, denied all.  But  the author was able to speak with many individuals in the airline industry  and came to believe what he was hearing.  Whether you believe in the  after-life or not, this book raised many questions that there's not always  an answer too.	2000-09-05

A collection of short stories featuring Christie's married team of Tommy  and Tuppence Beresford.  The stories are derived from Tommy and Tuppence  being asked to take over a detective agency that the authorities believe is  an information drop for the Russians.  Christie poked a little fun at  mystery writers and their counterparts by having the Beresford's take on  the persona of a different, fictional detective for each story including  Christie's famous, Belgium detective, Hercule Poirot.	2000-09-05

If I had, I might not have bothered to read any of his others.  Suffer the Children is not a good book.  The book's storyline centers around a legend about an old woman who slept and dreamed for two days and  two nights.  Her dreams told her who was going to die and how including  deaths involved with a mysterious cave.  Saul never really expands on the  legend to help the reader to understand why the evil has returned to Port  Arbello.  He throws into the mix a Ouija Board and a portrait of a little  girl, but once again, doesn't bother to connect it all up. My advice, try  one of Saul's later books.  Their much better.	2000-03-04

The story  concentrates on Colt and Hannah's love affair, but as a sideline, Mary Kay  teases the reader with Trevor and Willie's relationship. Readers will be  satisified with the conclusion of Hannah and Colt's story, but will be  craving for more on Willie and Trevor. That relationship needs a story of  it's own.	1999-08-14

This book was written for the Loveswept theme month of &quot;number 13&quot; celebrating the 13th anniversary of Loveswept Romances. Though Mary Kay mentions in a note to her readers that she has a hard time making  her stories work for theme months, something this reader finds hard to  believe :-), she was quite successful with this novel. It centers around a  group of people being quarintined thanks to an accident with a dropped box  full of bacterial bugs on a Friday the 13th. Dr. Kurt Andropov and Dr. Mack  McKissack are two of them. Their at odds with each other because of her  duties with CDC.

Added to the group is the strange character of  Dwayne, the delivery boy of the doomed box, timid Joanne, who is Dr.  Andropov's secretary, and Dr. Polly, another doctor at the institution.  Their all stuck with each other for 14 days.

If your wanting a good medical thriller to read, this is not the Robin Cook book for you.  Though fiction, it reads as non-fiction as Cook takes us into the life of a medical  student's internship in Hawaii.

Beth Simms has been hurt too many times by men to risk falling in love with Jack Reardon. However, she finds his charms too much to resist, as does her two-year old son who calls Jack &quot;daddy&quot; the first time  he sees him. The opening chapter is one laugh after another as Beth and  Jack meet for the first time at a car wash. Another hiliarious moment  occurs when Jack wants Beth off the roof she's trying to repair, and Beth,  while proclaiming she can do it herself, decides to put her foot through  the roof. From that moment of hilarity, comes a tender moment between the  two of them that expands as the book continues. My favorite thing about  this book was the clever way Mary Kay uses &quot;cliches&quot; at the  beginning of every chapter, and writes the chapter around those  &quot;Familiar Words&quot;....	1999-07-21

Virtual strangers, until they run into each  other, literally, Joe and Leslie are forced to spend time with each other  waiting to be rescued following their accident on an unused mountain road.  The story of their relationship jumps from anger to cordiality, to passion,  to friendship, to humor, to love, and to heartbreak. Mary Kay leaps from  one emotion to the next as she smoothly propels the story along, taking the  reader along for the ride. This book is the type of book that once you  finished it, all you can do is release a long sigh of pleasure.	1999-07-16

The hero in this books is Scotty Hammond and the heroine is Augusta Miller, known as Gus. She is the music teacher at the local school and Scotty is the new principle. Sparks fly between them when Gus is postive  she wants nothing to do with the handsome, talk of the town Scotty Hammond.  Scotty on the other hand, is just as determined to conquer her. True to  Mary Kay form, she opens the book with a comedic scene of Gus picking up  the garbage from Scotty's dog, Bertrum T. Goodfellow, known as Bert, and  throwing it back into Scotty's yard while talking aloud to herself about  what she'd like to do to him, and his dog, not realizing Scotty is there  the whole time listening, and had in fact, thrown the garbarge over the  fence into her yard, himself. The sparks fly from there. I have read all of  Mary Kay's books, and I found this one to be more passionate, and less  comedic than her other books. She does have several scenes, where we view  the going ons between Scotty and Gus thru the eyes of Bert, which were good  for a laugh.	1999-07-16

It was also the novel that introduced us to attorney Ben Kincaid and his sidekick, Christina McCall as they try to solve the mystery of a not so typical adoption case.  The story is fast paced, written with humor, and Mr. Bernahrdt has no  trouble humanizing Ben. If you read a &quot;Justice&quot; novel, you need  to start with this one, as Mr. Bernhardt does carry characters and  information over from one Justice novel to another.	1999-07-14

Enter---Esther Brite, an illigitimate child who grew up in a small Virginia town, and returns there after the death of her husband and child. Suffering from  pnemonia, her path crosses with the local doctor, Dr. Dan Jacobey, who,  unbeknown to Esther, has fallen in love with her after discovering her  childhood diary. Both are fighting personal demons, as they slowly become  friends, then lovers. Mary Kay keeps us aching for the two to &quot;finally  get together&quot;. She teases us with foreplay, then slowly increases the  passion between them until the moment of consummation. The story unfolds  with unusual sadness, as Mary Kay's books are usually filled with humurous  moments. She does lighten the mood with the characters of Addy Markham, the  doctor's housekeeper, who was once the Madam of the town, and Uncle  Fesstus. With poetic justice, Mary Kay ends the books with a peek into  &quot;another&quot; 16 year old's diary. This books is for those readers  who know what it's like to be different in a crowd, and who overcame the  hurts, caused by this difference, and became a better person because of it.	1999-07-14

All these changes  in her life and attitude have friends and co-workers wondering &quot;what's  wrong with Ellen&quot;. Eventually, Ellen wonders what's wrong with her  too. The subplots in this story are as good as the plot it's self.

Mary Kay has a  passionate scene in the book where Jan, thinking she's dreaming, literally  eyes Kevin from top to bottom, and bottom to top. The description of this  moment is so hot, I expected my book to burst into flames. Their  relationship is not without a couple of rocky moments. One, Jan's  relationship with her father, and the other, the fact that Kevin is in New  York, and Jan is in Colorado. Mary Kay's description of love &quot;trust,  affection, admiration, devotion, unselfish concern, acceptance, loyalty,  passion&quot;...had this faithful reader in tears.

The author covers not only the actions of Diana and Dodi before their fateful night, but the actions of what everyone else was doing at the time of the accident  and at the time of her death.  This is an easy read, as it reads like an  article in the Enquirer.  And yes, I found myself transfixed, against my  better judgement.  I have some questions about the authenticity of some of  the information in the book.  After all, who is really going to tell the  author that Prince Charles was wearing blue pajamas at the time he received  the call about Diana.  And, I admit to learning more about the actual  accident than I wanted to know.  All in all, I would recommend the book,  but keep in mind that not all the information may be fact.	1999-06-03
