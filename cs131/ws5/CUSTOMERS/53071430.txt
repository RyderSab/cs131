The award was well deserved.  It's not a great crime novel on par with (say) the best of James M. Cain or Raymond Chandler -- but it's better than the worst of those two writers, and better than the best of a lot of others.  Earlier reviewers correctly pegged some of the faults -- after a great first 50 pages, the pace flags till the ending; too many minor characters pop in and out of the action, and it takes too much effort to remember who they all are; you can see the strain as Muller tries to make the plot come out the way he wants it -- but the pleasures the book offers are great.  The sample boxing columns are a joy, and how many writers could take you blow by blow through a 5-round boxing match without boring the pants off you?  Muller pulls it off.  Some of his prose tries too hard to be slangy and period, but every now and then he'll sock you with a real gem, a turn of phrase that's so good you'll read it over again just to savor it.  And the plot may not be one you'll remember for ages, but neither is it an embarrassment.  It's adequate.<br />Most books I pick up disappoint me and I have to struggle to finish them.  This one's of a much higher caliber, and I'm looking forward to more from this author.	2004-01-18

(Unfortunately, that just means it's better than the dreadful MR. VERTIGO, the slight TIMBUKTU, and the dense, unsatisfying BOOK OF ILLUSIONS.)  However, Auster can't sustain it: The story-within-a-story reaches an impasse and gets abandoned (why? it was the most interesting thing in the book!), while the \\"real\\" story goes off in bizarre directions that cross the line between intriguingly peculiar and outright cartoonish.  (When the owner of the stationery store takes the main character to a Chinatown whorehouse, it works -- it's a bit strange, but in a properly Austerian [Austere?] way, and you go along with it.  When the man's store mysteriously disappears and reappears and then he starts attacking the main character with \\"karate chops,\\" you just roll your eyes and conclude that Auster has lost his marbles...or at least his previously excellent ear for what works and what doesn't.)  And the ending is wholly unsatisfying -- hugely anticlimactic and adding up to nothing much.<br />I loved THE MUSIC OF CHANCE, MOON PALACE, and LEVIATHAN, and though it was a little too self-consciously clever for its own good, THE NEW YORK TRILOGY as well.  But ever since those, Auster's been unable to regain the level of quality that once seemed to come so easily to him.  <br />There are delicious bits in the new book, but not a whole book's worth of them.  Here's hoping that Auster returns to form some time soon.	2003-11-20

The best were about a club called \\"The Black Widowers,\\" and this new book collects the ten best of the Black Widowers stories, plus six \\"lost\\" Black Widowers stories that never appeared in any Black Widowers collection before.  Plus two extra tribute stories by other authors, an introduction by Harlan Ellison, a Black Widowers story Asimov wrote featuring a character based on Ellison, and an essay by Asimov explaining how he came to write these stories in the first place.

It's bound to be at least a little bit of a let-down.  And a let-down it is.  Rowling does a nice job of spinning a yarn that's quite exciting at times, and no one will regret having read the book -- but it doesn't have the tight writing or the sense of wonder the second and third books had.  The magic, if you will, is missing.<br />What's wrong?  To begin with, the thing runs 870 pages and could profitably have been trimmed by at least a third.  It takes 200 pages just to get to Hogwarts, and there's a lot of repetition along the way.  (Did we need to see the clumsy girl wizard knock over a chair 10 times?  Wouldn't 5 have been enough?  For that matter, why was that character even in the book?  She doesn't do anything.  Cut her out entirely and no one would ever notice the absence.)  It feels as though Rowling is too big a star these days for any editor to dare to touch her prose, and that's a shame -- a good editor could have made the book a lot stronger.<br />Then there's the tone.  Yes, it's good that Harry's entering adolescence, and it's good that she treats it realistically -- but how much fun is it to see Harry being peevish, annoyed, grouchy, hurt, and resentful all the time?  I'm not saying this isn't true to the character, just that it isn't much fun to read.  You don't come to a Harry Potter book to read about Harry sniping at Ron and Hermione -- but that's what you get an awful lot of here.  Similarly, the book's villain, Dolores Umbridge, is truly unpleasant, but not in a fun way -- she's annoying in the way a loathsome, politically minded bureaucrat is, and the tone of the book suffers for it.  You grow to hate her, which is good, but you also grow to hate reading about her, which isn't.<br />Then there's the fact that Harry and Dumbledore go through basically the entire book refusing to speak to or even look at each other, and the fact that Hagrid doesn't show up for hundreds of pages and then,when he does, he's bloody, missing some teeth, and sporting broken ribs and a black eye.  I understand that Rowling wanted to vary the formula, but again, the particular choices she made made the book less enjoyable (for me).<br />The climactic battle is thrilling but hard to follow -- bad enough when it's 10 bad guys against 6 good guys, but when Rowling throws in another 5 characters out of nowhere and you have to follow 21 different moving parts...  I just gave up.<br />And when the smoke all clears, the climactic unraveling disappoints.  Dumbledore's big revelations aren't anything we haven't figured out long ago, and the MacGuffin of the story -- the thing Voldemort and his minions are striving to capture while all the forces of good are trying to keep it safe -- adds up to nothing much.  The big \\"weapon\\" everyone's so excited about is something that, had Voldemort gotten it, would just have told him he'd done something foolish long ago.  But so what?  How would it have been useful to Voldemort?  How could he have used it as a weapon, or at all?<br />There were some good things, too.  My favorite was the thestrals, invisible winged horses you can only see if you've witnessed a death.  But for every good bit there were two weak ones (the resolution of the Hagrid subplot, for instance, or the way the subplot about the O.W.L. exams was left unresolved), and my overall impression upon finishing the book was...eh.  Just 'eh.'  Years from now, I'll still be telling people about the great twists in CHAMBER OF SECRETS and AZKABAN, but I doubt I'll remember the plot of this one for more than a month.  And, sadly, I won't be looking forward to the sixth volume with nearly as much enthusiasm as I awaited this one.	2003-06-22

It's like watching a great juggler drop his balls: you're embarrassed for him and just pray for the act to end.<br />The plot here is contrived, the descriptions of the lost movies are endless (admirably painstaking, but not much fun to read), the dialogue is dreadful, and nowhere to be found is the frisson of delight you normally get from an Auster novel by way of the author's ingenious revelations and dislocating insights.<br />This book feels like an undergrad trying to 'do' Paul Auster: it's a pale and disappointing pastiche of the great man's style.	2002-08-31

The characters and plot are hard to keep straight, the hardboiled narration is so exaggerated and incessant that it comes off almost as parodic (clearly not the author's intent), and I found myself having to force my way through the second half of the book even though it's only 240 pages long.

It's not all that well written (some sections are painfully awkward), it's not that great a mystery (although the main revelation about the villain's identity is well delivered), the business of viewing everything through a Tourette's lens is handled in a ham-handed and tiresome fashion (i.e., take an element of ordinary life, describe it briefly, then have narrator comment &quot;That's just like Tourette's if you think about it&quot;), and you exit the book disappointed, especially if you entered expecting something great.<br />Not horrible, but not very good, either, and definitely not outstanding.	2001-11-06

On the plus side, the sequence early on when Scudder begins unraveling the mystery is very clever, there are some passages of really good writing, the sequences with Scudder's sons and ex-wife are terrific, and (as always) the book just races along and keeps you reading.  <br />Definitely a better-than-average mystery novel, but only a solid B+ -- not the A+ work we saw in great Scudder novels like EIGHT MILLION WAYS TO DIE, WHEN THE SACRED GINMILL CLOSES, and A STAB IN THE DARK.  It's more like the &quot;popcorn thriller&quot; Scudder we got in A TICKET TO THE BONEYARD, but that book edges the new one out by a hair because it was more frightening and visceral (although the villain was just as two-dimensional).	2001-10-20

There is no way an unbiased reader could look at this book, which is a very serious and moving novel, and conclude that it's in the bottom 10-15% of books ever written (which is effectively what a 1-star review means, if you assume a bell curve with most books meriting 3 stars and very few deserving 1 or 5).  You might like the book more or less depending on your tastes, and you might decide it's a 3-star or 4-star book instead of a 5-star book, but it is clearly, definitely not a 1-star book.  The people writing 1-star reviews appear to be angry that the book exists -- just look at the invective and fury in their reviews -- rather than judging it for its literary merit, which is considerable.  <br />It is shameful that in America, the free country the firemen they loved died to defend, these people are waging an underhanded, sneaky campaign to try to silence an author and cause a worthy book to disappear just because they don't approve of the way certain characters are portrayed.

Nobody else writes sentences as stunning as Max Phillips.  He could write a biography of Frank Perdue and make chicken farming irresistable.<br />Here, he has a great subject, too -- one of history's most enigmatic and intriguing personalities, immortalized in Tom Lehrer's amusing song &quot;Alma,&quot; but amply deserving of the richer, more insightful treatment she gets here.  She's more than just wife and mistress to all the great men of turn-of-the-century Vienna; she's a troubled, difficult woman trying to find her identity in a social circle where anyone with less than genius-level talent would have trouble holding her own.

After 37 reviews have been posted, there isn't much left to say, but having devoting several days to getting through this brick of a novel, I wanted to add my voice to the chorus.  <br />The book is good -- but it isn't great, and deep down you know it isn't even very good.  Read Henry Roth's CALL IT SLEEP and Doctorow's RAGTIME and you'll see what Baker's work is a charming but very clearly lesser imitation of.  It's like the difference between Elvis and an Elvis impersonator -- same hair, same suit, but one's a great original and one's just a guy hoping to evoke memories of a great original by putting on a familiar wig and suit.<br />The book could have been 100 pages shorter without harming anything -- how many times, for heaven's sake, do we have to read a character's thoughts about the &quot;perfect breasts&quot; of the angel painted above the front gate to Dreamland?  Fine, they're big, they're gorgeous, we get the point.  How many times do we have to read &quot;STEEPLECHASE -- FUNNY PLACE&quot;?  How many times do we have to see the dwarf poke some hapless park-goer with his electric cattle prod?  More than once, yes, but 5 or 6 times?<br />The Freud and Jung scenes should all have been left on the cutting room floor.  Especially the last one -- the novel would have been better ending on the last Trick the Dwarf scene rather than with the anticlimactic and obvious porcupine joke.<br />Gyp the Blood starts out as a serious antagonist -- but then Baker seriously undercuts him by having him foiled in every scene after the first.  Making him a hapless oaf doesn't improve the book. <br />The perspective isn't as rigorously consistent as it ought to be in a book that labels every chapter with a viewpoint character's name.<br />And the &quot;you decide what happened&quot; ending is a disappointment -- you've been waiting for the Triangle fire all through the book, especially after the opening scene has Trick saying &quot;Most of all the story is about fire,&quot; you've been teased with the mock tenement fire in Coney Island and the &quot;crying wolf&quot; in the sweatshop Esse works in before Triangle, so the tacking on of the Triangle scene as almost an afterthought at the end feels contemptuous of the reader, almost turning the book into one big shaggy dog story.<br />Not a bad book, I'm not sorry to have read it, but jeez, don't compare it to the great New York immigrant novels.

Though nearly unbearable, this might just possibly have worked in one of his burglar novels, which are basically comedies.  But there is no way it could work in a Keller story, since Keller is a serious (almost tragic) character.<br />Then, too, there is the subject of padding: entire scenes have no bearing on the plot.  Unbelievably, Block spends pages on the details of the deliberations of a jury Keller happens to sit on when he's called to jury duty.  And it's not even an interesting case -- something about a stolen VCR, with no bearing on the rest of the book.<br />Then there's the ending: you're waiting for a twist, but what Block comes up with is almost pointless.  It feels as though he got to the end of the book without knowing how to finish it, so he tacked on a two-page &quot;explanation&quot; and sent it to his publisher.<br />Then there's the writing: in HIT MAN, you tolerated that some pieces of information were repeated from chapter to chapter, since each chapter had originally appeared as a stand-alone short story.  Here, there is no excuse for it.  In chapter 4 you're told something like &quot;Maggie, whom Keller met at an art gallery, was a beautiful woman&quot; -- why in the world say this when the reader *knows* where Keller met her, having just read it in chapter 3???  Dot keeps asking Keller &quot;Did you buy any stamps?&quot; and saying &quot;Well, now you can buy some more,&quot; as though Block didn't realize that he had already used these lines of dialogue earlier.<br />The introduction of seriously-taken astrology and palmistry is another annoyance -- it's just not appropriate in this character's world.  But the problem is rampant: Keller is not the same wonderful character here that he was in the first book.  He's just a very different character this time, and not in ways that are improvements.<br />What's going on?  TANNER ON ICE was very funny in spots but close to incoherent in terms of plot, with a weak &quot;that's it?&quot; ending.  EVERYBODY DIES was not terrible, but it was definitely a weak Scudder novel.  Block has been an amazingly good writer for so long -- has he lost his talent completely?  It's painful to watch a favorite writer lose his ability, and I have a bad feeling that's what we're starting to see...priate in this character's world.

Well, Ambrose Bierce used the gag at the core of this film many, many years before Auster did.  Borges used it, too.  That by itself is fine -- the fact that Homer wrote about war doesn't mean no one else should ever again -- but seems to think his gag is clever, orginal, and not telegraphed, when nothing could be further from the truth.

US	53071430	R200DX4MVN1YE0	0881848409	701853996	Buyer Beware	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Aptly titled	I read this book on the recommendation of the normally reliable Ed Gorman (who praises it to the heavens in his famous BLACK LIZARD ANTHOLOGY OF CRIME FICTION).  What could he have been thinking?  This is a very bland,  not very well written, entirely average P.I. novel.  There is a good twist  or two, but the big revelation at the climax is poorly developed and not  nearly as deep a philosophical comment on modern life as the author  imagines.  The occasional pungent observation does not save this book from  being one of the drearier 188 pages I have struggled through.  Skip it.	1999-08-08
US	53071430	R12T87KA8G0HAH	0345427769	625419312	East of A	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Excellent modern noir (in spite of some self-indulgence)	Atwood's first novel is delicious, if occasionally overripe: he allows himself too many deliberately purple passages, as well as gimmicks such as text laid out vertically to reflect a character's fall out of a window and  random words spelled in dialect (i.e., &quot;wire&quot; for &quot;why  are&quot;).  But the patches of questionable prose will improve with age --  what Atwood already has going for him is a fabulous sense of place (you can  see and smell the Village as you read) and a knack for suspense.  A scene  with Payton trapped in a subway tunnel as a train approaches is a fabulous  nail-biter, even if it's not entirely clear to the reader just how Payton  manages to survive.  On the whole, a good read and an auspicious debut.	1999-03-02

Some of the comedy works, but plenty of it lands thuddingly;  some of the scenes are clever, but plenty are off-the-rack stuff out of a  thousand PI movies; some of the character business feels real, but plenty  feels only 2.5-dimensional.  Coben is doing good work, better than  Lutz/Estleman/Pronzini, but not better than Lawrence Block, not better than  Jerome Doolittle, and for heaven's sake certainly not on par with the  classics.<br />Not to say you won't enjoy this book if you buy it, but it's  not as fabulous as all the other reviewers seem to think.	1998-10-11

If the title  character's quasi-religious epiphany at the end doesn't reach quite the  heights of profundity the author clearly intended, it nevertheless evokes a  powerful sense of empathy and pity from the reader.  The antagonist's final  actions before abruptly departing from the pages of the novel are  mysterious indeed (a less polite reader might attribute this to the  writer's clumsiness), but in some ways fit perfectly into the novel's  existential scheme.  An awfully good read.	1998-10-11

Too bad that his climax is cheesily movie-ish and his resolution pat.  An effectively developed romantic subplot is  abandoned 2/3rds of the way through the book and is left unresolved at the  end.  Still, a clever concept, a clever unraveling, and much excellent  writing in between.	1998-10-11

It's exceptionally readable and, in spots, beautifully written.   But that's just spots, and long-time fans of the series will find the book  as a whole less satisfying than EIGHT MILLION WAYS TO DIE and A STAB IN THE  DARK (easily the two best) or WHEN THE SACRED GINMILL CLOSES, A TICKET TO  THE BONEYARD, THE SINS OF THE FATHERS, and A DANCE AT THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE  (the four next best).  <br />There's a lot of recapping going on -- in the  first few chapters, Block retells four or five stories from the earlier  novels, which turns out to be necessary for the plot, but which is a bit  tiresome for those of us who've already read those stories before.  The  bits of business with Elaine are perfectly believable, but ripe with the  sort of squashy domesticity that has sapped some of the noir juice out of  the most recent installments in the Scudder story.  Jive-talking TJ has  always been something of an embarrassment, and he remains one here,  although his schtick is (thankfully) somewhat toned down.  And there's a  &quot;spring cleaning&quot; feeling to the whole affair, as legions of the  series' supporting characters are offed.  Not that Block (or Scudder)  doesn't treat the deaths with sufficient gravity -- it's just that you get  the feeling of an author saying, &quot;Let's wipe the slate clean and start  Scudder off on a new path, with less baggage.&quot;  (Which may be a good  thing for the next Scudder novel -- less recapping to be done, perhaps --  but it casts a shadow over this one.)<br />The book isn't bad, not by a long  shot, but it doesn't sparkle (on the whole) with the sheer brilliance of  the best Scudders.	1998-09-20

The opening chapters, in which a 4-F  novelist comes across an equally 4-F thug while walking along the beach  during WWII, are among the funniest I've read.  The comedy slacks off a bit  in later chapters, which begin to read a bit more like your average  mid-list mystery (protag butts heads with a pair of sarcastic cops; protag  comes across an injustice and rights the wrong; obligatory climactic twist,  in this case ripped off shamelessly from the film &quot;The Usual  Suspects&quot;), but even then the writing remains unusually strong  (especially the crackling dialogue) and the novel sports an atmosphere of  seriousness the average mystery lacks.  The main character is a failure,  and his sense of being a failure pervades the book.  Far from being the  turn-off this sounds like, it infuses the story with a richness not often  found in its peers.  A funnier and more sober mystery than the average, and  well worth reading.	1998-09-20

And this latest Cuddy adventure opens with one of the  series' best scenes, a gripping murder of a philandering divorce lawyer on  a dark and deserted stretch of highway.  So it's all the more disappointing  that soon after the first scene ends, the book degrades to a sadly  pedestrian quality of writing, both on the level of the plotting (Cuddy  talks to this suspect, Cuddy talks to that suspect) and the prose itself  (Healy particularly overdoes the device of ending a statement in dialog  with a question mark, you know, to mimic the way people actually  talk?).<br />Worst of all, Healy deliberately sets up a complicated red  herring solution involving a lesbian co-worker of the deceased.  It feels  cheap when you think it's the real solution and cheaper still when you  realize the author is just playing games with you.  It doesn't help that  the actual solution, while more PC, is neither clever nor satisfying, nor  that the book ends abruptly, with bits of character business  unresolved.<br />There are better Cuddy novels by far.	1998-08-30

I know -- it's been ten years since I last read it, and it just floored me again. <br /> The writing is a bit affected and takes some getting used to, but it's worth it.  When you get to the climax and the secret is revealed, you'll sit slackjawed and start paging back through the book, desperate to see how you missed it.  A brilliant puzzle, brilliantly constructed and brilliantly unfolded. <br /> If you like mysteries, do not -- I repeat, do not -- leave this screen without buying this book.	1998-04-07

Bernie is not yet the proprietor of his used bookstore here -- he's a full-time burglar and part-time detective, working desperately to free his dentist from a charge of murder.  Block's authoritative asides on the science of burglary are delicious and the climactic unmasking of the killer at the end is entirely satisfying.  (Fans of the series will note that this book contains the first appearance of artist Denise Raphaelson, who returns to great effect in Block's brilliant THE BURGLAR WHO PAINTED LIKE MONDRIAN.)	1997-11-16
US	53071430	R2QTCNFV5QFADT	067149581X	732565880	The Burglar Who Painted Like Mondrian	Books	5	0	0	N	N	The best of the Bernie Rhodenbarr novels	Of the eight Bernie Rhodenbarr novels published as of the end of 1997, THE BURGLAR WHO PAINTED LIKE MONDRIAN is by far the best...and, ironically, it is also one of the the few Lawrence Block novels that, as of the same date, was out of print.  MONDRIAN carries on the &quot;Burglar Who&quot; tradition of burying Bernie up to his neck in trouble and letting the reader watch as he resourcefully digs himself out. This time, the plot involves genuine and forged Mondrian paintings, a kidnapped cat, an impregnable building which Bernie repeatedly breaks into, plus a dozen other elements; and somehow it all comes together perfectly.  Like a Mozart concerto, like a Fred Astaire dance routine, this book hits all the right notes, maintains its balance and rhythm, and leaves the reader wanting more.  It won't be out of print forever.  When it returns, buy several copies: this is one you'll want to give to your friends.	1997-11-16

When the curtain finally rose again, they learned that Bernie had gone straight in the intervening years.  Never fear: before long, our hero is driven back to a life of crime when his new landlord raises his rent from $875/month to $10,500/month.  This time, the job at hand is the theft of a set of extremely rare baseball cards, but before long there's also murder involved and, as usual, Bernie finds himself on the hook for it.  The plot gets very hairy very quickly, and unlike in MONDRIAN (where every ball juggled remains miraculously aloft and -- to mix metaphors -- every loose end is brilliantly tied off) it quickly spirals out of Block's control.  &quot;Everybody knows you can't tell the players without a scorecard,&quot; says one character, and it's certainly true here: before long you give up trying to follow the improbable relationships among characters.  But the comedy is great, as is the opportunity to visit with one of mystery fiction's most appealing protagonists, and no fan of caper novels should miss this one.	1997-11-16

Here it's a lost poem by Rudyard Kipling, and before the adventure is finished, the rare manuscript will be found, lost, and found again.  Block manages to produce a great slapstick comedy without once sacrificing the air of menace and  tension that hangs over the proceedings.  By the time he pulls a fair and satisfying solution out of his hat, you want to stand and applaud.  Readers of THE BURGLAR WHO LIKED TO QUOTE KIPLING are Block readers for life.	1997-11-16

Bernie is not yet a fully formed character here (readers whose first exposure to Bernie came from the more recent books will miss Bernie's bookstore and his best friend, Carolyn), but the plot is irresistable (the solution is truly memorable) and the comedy is first-rate.  A zany, silly, frenetic virtuoso performance, and one of the few comic mysteries that stands up to repeated re-reading.	1997-11-16

This time out, Bernie tangles with international intrigue and high romance, just like his on-screen hero, Bogie; and while the mix is funny and sporadically engrossing, neither the comedy nor the mystery reach this exceptional series' normal high standards.  Block is a master plotter -- so how could he have his characters puzzle over the meaning of the dying message &quot;CAPHOB&quot; without once connecting it with the character (conspicuously and implausibly) named &quot;Captain Hoberman&quot;?  That the connection turns out to be a red herring makes it all the worse -- Block squanders a chance to lead readers merrily astray and frustrates them in the process.  Much of the plot also feels like a reprise from earlier episodes: Bernie gets locked in a closet as in THE BURGLAR IN THE CLOSET, he repeatedly manages to enter an impregnable apartment building as in THE BURGLAR WHO PAINTED LIKE MONDRIAN, and so on.  And, for opposite reasons, both knowledgable Bogart affionados and people who care nothing about Bogart are likely to feel the author spends a bit too much space on plot synopses of Bogart films.  Make no mistake -- there is also plenty to enjoy here.  But there is more to enjoy in any of the other books in the series.  If you've read all the rest and are hungry for more, you shouldn't miss this one; but by all means start with one of the better ones (such as the two mentioned above).	1997-11-16

ARIEL is mystery writer Lawrence Block's experiment with the sort of feverish, madness-tinged horror for which Shirley Jackson became famous, and if he doesn't quite pull it off, one at least has to appreciate the bravery of the attempt.  Block is one of the best prose craftsmen working today, but he is at his worst here, switching perspectives wildly, invoking too-familiar ghost story devices without the deftness required to make them seem fresh, peopling the story with unpleasant characters, and ending the book on a sour and very unsatisfying note.  To be fair, Block has picked a tough genre -- most of the time, Shirley Jackson wasn't able to pull it off either.  Chalk it up as one of Block's (extremely) rare failures, and move on.  (For a Block horror success, try the truly terrifying Matt Scudder thriller A TICKET TO THE BONEYARD.)	1997-11-16

In AFTER HOURS, Block submits to a series of intimate interviews about his characters and themes, his life, and his craft.  From anecdotes about the vanished world of pulp mystery publishing to serious thoughts about how the best mystery novels transcend the genre, Block offers much that will be of interest to his readers.  Also included in the book are a complete Block bibliography and the first reprinting in 40 years of Block's first short story, &quot;You Can't Lose.&quot;  AFTER HOURS may not be compelling for the casual Block reader, but for the hardcore fan it is a must.	1997-11-16

It is strange, then, to see him tromping through the snow and the plush rooms of a British-style manor house in THE BURGLAR IN THE LIBRARY.  Block uses the eighth installment in this excellent series as an opportunity to send up mysteries of the Agatha Christie &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; variety (also taking some affectionate potshots at Raymond Chandler along the way).  The result is extremely funny, and the brilliance of the comedy makes it hard to mind too much that the solution to the book's mystery is awfully hard to follow.  Does anyone complain that the plot of Neil Simon's &quot;Murder By Death&quot; doesn't make any sense?  No.  They just pop the tape in the VCR and laugh themselves sick.  THE BURGLAR IN THE LIBRARY is disorienting in spots and some long-time readers may not approve of the change of venue, but I defy any reader to make it from cover to cover without laughing out loud.  A wonderful, wonderful work of comic fiction.	1997-11-16

After the brutal attack, the couple tracks the killers back to New York City and meticulously plots and executes a plan of revenge.  As usual for Block's novels, the prose is lean and the plot compelling.  The event that sets the story in motion invites skepticism -- would professional hitmen pause at the scene of a murder to rape an eyewitness, and if so, would they then leave the witness and her husband alive? -- but thereafter the storytelling is flawless, right through the shattering and cinematic gun battle with which the book closes.    Fans of Block's work will note that this novel was the author's first to be written in the third person; his first to feature a scene in New York's Grammercy Park (which reappears memorably in THE BURGLAR IN THE CLOSET); and his first to become a movie (&quot;Nightmare Honeymoon,&quot; 1973).  Fans of this novel should try the same author's MONA and THE GIRL WITH THE LONG GREEN HEART or Cornell Woolrich's THE BRIDE WORE BLACK.	1997-11-15
