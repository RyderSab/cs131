Contributing Editor, Curled Up With a Good Book (curledup.com)<br />In the ground-breaking tradition of The Celestine Prophecy and Conversations with God, The Serpent's Dance (Book One) by Shri Yannam is an extraordinary memoir cum novel cum self-transformation guide. Inspired by the ancient wisdom of the author's Eastern background, Yannam uncovers twenty-one secrets of self-mastery through a surreal but powerful conversation with his soul guide, who appears to him in the form of a cobra in the wreckage of a tornado's aftermath.	2002-11-30

Healer, Social Worker<br />It takes a lot of courage to do what Shri Yannam has done -- to take a deep, honest, fearless look at oneself. I longed to read The Serpent's Dance before it was called 'The Serpent's Dance' and before it was ready to go to print. And I longed to read it after it did! And I'll read it again and again -- because the wisdom inside this book is truly timeless, and it transcends any and all belief systems. This book will draw your attention to the 'dance' that's happening within you, within that relationship you have with your lover, and with your world at large.<br />Shri Yannam is truly a blessing to all of us. Here is someone who's so incredibly worldly and sagely -- both at the same time! This will become apparent to the reader right from the very first chapter of the book. I hope all of you enjoy it as much as I have.	2002-11-30

Writer &amp; editor<br />This book simply defies being categorized. The Serpent's Dance, Book 1 (of a trilogy) seems to be three things at once. First, it is a fictionalized account of the author's experience that portrays a transformational shift from being the victim of circumstances to intentionally creating his world. It integrates the author's experience with ancient wisdom, which results in &quot;ah-ha&quot; experiences for both author and reader.<br />Second, the book is very entertaining and rich with imagery. I found it difficult to put down. Yannam's vivid descriptions put readers in the middle of the action. <br />Third, The Serpent's Dance is almost an instructional book. At a minimum, Yannam implies that similar insights and mastery of self are open to practitioners of meditation. <br />Yannam's descriptions are so vivid it's like you are there. And such insights he has! When our hero gets the green light to move in with a new girlfriend and is given free reign to redecorate her house while she goes on vacation, instead of red flags, he sees an opportunity. Of course when she returns, the confrontation is inevitable. A serpent named Siddhah is Shri's confidant and mentor throughout the book. In conversations with Siddhah, Shri discovers how problems can be opportunities for learning. The serpent illustrates how events actually played out perfectly to reveal the actors' inner needs and unspoken intentions. <br />Historically, the symbol of the serpent emphasizes knowledge or inner wisdom, with an initially frightening aspect. The serpent is at once both revered and reviled. It exemplifies wisdom and secret knowledge, similar to the wise old man. <br />In The Serpent's Dance, Book 1, the serpent at first represents the destruction of the author's physical world and his point of view about the &quot;reality&quot; he has experienced in relationships and a near-fatal accident that left his lower half paralyzed. <br />Shri (as protagonist) has a conversation with the serpent in which he discovers that destruction is necessary for creation to occur. Further he discovers how various problems in relationships and the accident actually served the purpose of manifesting his inner needs or unconscious motivations. In other words, there is perfection in how things turned out that lead to inner development. <br />Siddhah's secrets seem to echo many of the enlightened perspective of the world's treasured spiritual writings. They actually make sense when presented next to the episodes in the author's life. <br />I heartily recommend Serpent's Dance for its entertaining and readable style. As Shri fearlessly bares his soul, you just might also learn something about yourself.	2002-11-30

Shri's book is a candid, insightful look into the human spirit, and his personal accounts touched our lives and hearts. No matter what spiritual beliefs the reader may or may not hold, there is much to be gained in personal guidance and transformation. We have experienced a self-awareness and insight that has strengthened our relationship as a couple. Shri's writing style is personable and easy to follow without sacrificing depth.

Shri does an excellent job of relating oft repeated ancient truths (the Gita, etc. in my case) as solutions to modern day stresses. He follows a unique approach in examining our deepest emotions, prejudices, likes, dislikes. His approach is secular in nature and free from all dogma (something that is hard to come by these days). The book does not come up with a list of do's and dont's or a magic wand that will brush away all our imbalances. What it does offer are ways at better understanding and de-mystifying our own inner selves. The style followed is one of a conversation between Shri and Siddhah - an imaginary Serpent in the form of a tornado. This could easily represent the reader and the tornado within each one of us.<br />Shri's formulas will go a long way in helping us better understand ourselves which will result in a better understanding of the universe external to us. This book is a must for every receptive mind.	2002-11-30

U.S. Air Force Veteran, ex-Honeywell Technology Manager <br />This book opens with a exciting, riveting dialog of the development of a North Texas weather phenomenom, a Tornado, its' touchdown and the resulting chaos, devastation and frightening circumstances. So what does a Tornado have to do with a &quot;The Serpent's Dance&quot;? For that matter, what is a &quot;The Serpent's Dance&quot;?<br />As you will see, Shri Yannam proceeds to skillfully and cleverly craft this attention-getting stormy opening into the introduction of the touchdown, destruction and change of perception that was brought into his own personal life. It is the true story of his courage, toughness, anger, tears, and then the eventual peace, or at least reconcillation, of coming to terms with human life in a new form, from a changed- perspective.<br />In most every book I have read I have become aware of the occurence that somewhere amongst the pages lies a few lines or paragraphs that &quot;glue&quot; the book together. That is, they very directly, sometimes profoundly, express, coincisely, what the message is that the author seeks communicate in through the entire book. Here, I believe that I have found such words on page 58.: &quot;For now, suffice it to say that compassion by the self, for the self would have worked a lot better. But you see - if you had compassion, then you would have been heart-centered. Which you weren't. You don't know what it meant to be heart-centered, nor did you really want to know. You humans turn yourselves into overwhelmingly complex bundles of energies when you slip into your heads and out of your hearts. The head is always trying to figure things out as it tries to make sense of the infinity of variables that life seems to throw at you. The heart already knows all [that] there is to know. [The composer] Mozart once said, &quot;All the music [that] I want to compose has already been written. Such an awareness can only come thru [sic] a heart- centered awareness, from a sense of being that permeates you through and through.&quot; And further: &quot; If you had self-compassion, you would not have needed a crisis to awaken you. A warm, open heart allows for simple, powerful awareness to settle into your bones, without effort, without struggle, without friction, without pain, where no stick-and-carrot method can do the trick. A heart will take you places where no head can, [nor] no head will!<br />Summing it up, this entire book was apparently written by Shri Yannam from his heart and soul and it does profoundly have heart. It is his desire now to give this to the world.	2002-11-30

Senior Editor, Metaphysical Reviews.<br />Here is a fast-paced and in-depth look at life, the real life often hidden under layers of day-to-day situations, not unlike a downtown building in sore need of a sand blasting. <br />Author, speaker, musician and artist Shri Yannam has woven a provocative conversation between himself and his soul...and his path to self-mastery. <br />Serpent's Dance cuts through these strata of self-absorption, stress, need for things and ego to reveal the secrets to transformation to re-align with one's divine Self. The author and his soul, in the form of a cobra, penetrate the spell we cast upon ourselves when we step away from truth. <br />&quot;Within you, the Masculine and the Feminine are the two major aspects of your psyche...simply put, your Masculine is the assertive force...your Feminine is the receptive force...if they dance in harmony you create success, otherwise, you fail.&quot; This Truth begins the reader's journey to enlightenment, and Serpent's Dance becomes the illumination of that path. <br />As Mr. Yannam recounts his transformation, nuggets of wisdom and discovery shine through. &quot;Become what thou seeks, and thou shall have it.&quot; So, if you want to have fun, become fun. This principle applies to everything you seek in life: happiness, joy, love, peace, and prosperity. <br />Serpent's Dance offers the means to discover who you really are---and with the acceptance of who you really are, you become free of the influences of others. Shri Yannam has written a book of revelations in a novel format.

Review by Lauren Pickard --  Healer, Single mother.<br />The Serpent's Dance is a comprehensive dialogue between Shri, the author, and a serpent, the author's chosen spirit form representing our super-consciousness or God-consciousness. This insightful conversation explores the depths of Shri's spiritual transformation through the perspective of his personal relationships.<br />I came to this book during a time of deep emotional healing. Life is an anthology of relationships, and when you heal one aspect, you automatically open the doors to healing them all. As Shri shares his journey of transcendence, it's an opportunity and an invitation to heal along with him.<br />The greatest teachers impart wisdom by example. The Serpent's Dance offers any reader an example of how to exist within the dichotomy of life, naturally balanced. It's intimate, comical, and its' vast, colorful concepts of self-mastery are presented in simple terms, with situational references.<br />This book reflects the innate wisdom within each of us and reminds us that our transformation, or \\"shedding of old skin,\\" is always unfolding.	2002-11-30

Shri combines an excellent storytelling style with his own personal insights and experiences to weave his story, and the result is a soulful journey that is both a fantasy and a realistic look at human behavior. His counterpart in the story, the Serpent, is a frank and sagacious advisor who shows the narrator a new way to see himself. Drawing on everything from eastern philosophy to western psychology, Shri shows us in a clear and entertaining way that we too can benefit from the Serpent's teachings.	2002-11-30

Review by Ram Bhandari -- Corporate Engineering Consultant.<br />When I got Shri Yannam's book, The Serpent's Dance, at first I merely flipped through the pages, peeking into the contents here and there to see if it'd interest me. As I did, I paused to glance at some of the so-called Serpent's secrets (in bold italicized text). But my inquisitive mind longed to dig into the details leading to the secrets. And before I knew it, I found myself reading the entire book in just one sitting...from start to finish! As I read, I realized that the book was about the author's own life transforming experiences. So it became that much more interesting. <br />As it so often happens to our rational minds, when it is blocked suddenly by an insurmountable obstacle, an intense process of self-inquiry begins. This leads one to discover the essential nature of self and its binding to universal spirit. The intellect dives into the subconscious, empties itself of all rational thought, and rises again to reach spirit in order to understand the essence nature of reality. This is precisely what has happened to Shri Yannam. <br />Traditionally, in ancient Indian scriptures, a central principle is stated before an exhaustive explanation is put forth, further helped along by parables to drive the point home. Though Shri Yannam seeks to do the same thing, there is a difference in his approach. Shri dives into the conflict first (taking the reader with him)...before both resurface again with enough wisdom to understand and dissolve the conflict in question. This is precisely what makes his writing so interesting and so relevant to our present times. Rather than use traditional parables, Shri employs the struggles and conflicts imbued in our contemporary lives. Thus profound wisdom, inherent in spirit itself, is brought forth in a manner that makes it easy to assimilate.	2002-11-30

Sound Healer &amp; Practitioner. <br />I found Serpent's Dance to be full of practical insights - stuff even an average person on the street can relate to and &quot;see&quot; for themselves. It made me reflect on a lot of things in my own life. So don't be surprised if you become inspired to take a good look at your own life, and feel inspired to make the necessary changes. Serpent's Dance paints a gripping picture of how the cosmic dance operates in each and every one of us. I was specially moved by the parts of the book that focused on the conflict one has with one's parents (don't we all?), how to &quot;see&quot; it, how to move past it. Kudos, Shri!	2002-04-19

No matter what spiritual beliefs the reader may or may not hold, there is much to be gained in personal guidance and transformation. We have experienced a self-awareness and insight that has strengthened our relationship as a couple. Shri's writing style is personable and easy to follow without sacrificing depth. Each episodic lesson is culminated with concise and memorable \\"gems\\".

Co-Director Earth Sound Light Center, MA. Author of Within The Sound.<br />Come back to the Garden with Shri Yannam's journey, \\"Serpent's Dance: Secrets of Self-Mastery.\\"<br />In a delightfully authentic way Shri becomes a master weaver, threading the warp and weft of the time-space continuum, magnifying the present moment with the lens of soul vision. Through dialogue with Soul disguised as the mythical serpent, universal wisdom is woven with direct individual experience of the living present. Secrets are revealed through the mirror of reality, illusion, and the individual's part in the creation of that reality. Formulas are offered to aid the reader's memory in receiving the gifts of the lessons we humans create to help us evolve into truly conscious, fully alive beings on this transforming planet. <br />Once you start reading you won't stop. And then you'll want to go back and write down those secrets and formulas in your journal for easy reference. They'll help you through your own journey back to the Garden.	2002-04-19

So what does a Tornado have to do with a \\"Serpent's Dance\\"? For that matter, what is a \\"Serpent's Dance\\"?<br />As you will see, Shri Yannam proceeds to skillfully and cleverly craft this attention-getting stormy opening into the introduction of the touchdown, destruction and change of perception that was brought into his own personal life. It is the true story of his courage, toughness, anger, tears, and then the eventual peace, or at least reconcillation, of coming to terms with human life in a new form, from a changed- perspective.<br />In most every book I have read I have become aware of the occurence that somewhere amongst the pages lies a few lines or paragraphs that \\"glue\\" the book together. That is, they very directly, sometimes profoundly, express, coincisely, what the message is that the author seeks communicate in through the entire book. Here, I believe that I have found such words on page 58.: \\"For now, suffice it to say that compassion by the self, for the self would have worked a lot better. But you see - if you had compassion, then you would have been heart-centered. Which you weren't. You don't know what it meant to be heart-centered, nor did you really want to know. You humans turn yourselves into overwhelmingly complex bundles of energies when you slip into your heads and out of your hearts. The head is always trying to figure things out as it tries to make sense of the infinity of variables that life seems to throw at you. The heart already knows all [that] there is to know. [The composer] Mozart once said, \\"All the music [that] I want to compose has already been written. Such an awareness can only come thru [sic] a heart- centered awareness, from a sense of being that permeates you through and through.\\" And further: \\" Ifyou had self-compassion, you would not have needed a crisis to awaken you. A warm, open heart allows for simple, powerful awareness to settle into your bones, without effort, without struggle, without friction, without pain, where no stick-and-carrot method can do the trick. A heart will take you places where no head can, [nor] no head will!<br />Summing it up, this entire book was apparently written by Shri Yannam from his heart and soul and it does profoundly have heart. It is his desire now to give this to the world.	2002-04-19
