He is an enthusiast writing for other enthusiasts, some previous knowledge and experience, which I lacked, is required. However, the book is mostly fascinating and well-written. His main themes seems to be that sword fighting techniques are much more ancient than commonly believed. He also writes much about the German mensur fighting, which actually is quite interesting. Another theme is he really wants to distuinguish between competitive fencing, which has little to do with real fencing, and duelling and combative fencing: one is a game and one is as serious as it can get. <br />I liked his writing style and his erudition. This book would be a serious addition to the library of any fencer with an interest in there sport/hobby.	2005-09-04

I think that Rowling's books about Harry Potter filled a gap left by such monumentous children's authors like Enid Blyton, Rosemary Sutcliffe, Beatrix Potter, etc. There was just nothing like them when Rowling entered the scene. Rowling very cleverly contrasts a dreary British suburban middle class existence with the dreamlike magic of Hogwarts. In essence, Rowling manages to capture all our dreams of escaping our dreary lives, fleeing to somewhere where dreams come true, and that our existence has meaning - we are someone special! Other authors write excellent children's books - Pratchett and Gainman for instance, but they are either a bit to frightening or too adult for most children. Rowling's strength is that her language is very simple, but the themes she deal with are very real and imprtant, and most of us can relate to them. Harry likes being special, but he also sees that being special will draw him unwanted attention. He learns the magic, but power also attracts danger. There are two sides to every coin, and Rowling makes that clear from the beginning.<br /><br />At one level, these books are escapism, but on another, more subtle, level they are an introduction to adult life.	2005-07-14

Harry and his classmates are definitely leaving the innocence of childhood behind themselves, and entering the more complex, and threatening, world of adults. Rowlings quite adeptly ties in the problems of Harry's beginning puberty with the new threat of the recently arisen Voldemort.  <br />Everything has conspired to make this year the most difficult so far at Hogwarts: the death of a student the previous year, the OWL exams, the discord sown by the adherents of Voldemorts, and the efforts of the Ministry of Magic to quell any dissenting voice among British  wizardry. The atmosphere is bad, everyone is edgy. Amidst it all the Ministry of Magic meddles in the interior affairs of the school. <br />Rowlings tries to write for several audiences: children, young adults, and adults. It is difficult, but she does pull it off, albeit barely in my humble opinion. <br />Rowlings strength, as I see it, is that she writes about things everyone can recongise: we have all suffered from school bullies, we have all experienced times when no one wants to listen, we have all had to sit this horrible tests, etc. We relate to the characters, and can understand Harry's simple wish of just to be listened to! <br />We get a rare glimpse of the time of Harry's father. A more harmonious time when the members of Slythering and Gryffindor got along, and could form friendships. In the present Slythering appears to grow further and further apart from the rest of the school, and it appears it is just a matter of time before the entire House falls to Voldemort. Professor Snape is good at protecting Harry, but he seems less adept at keeping members of his own House in check. Or does Dumbledore have a plan?	2005-05-09

Slim's theory is that politicians give guidelines for the campaign, and generals provide the training and backup so that the soldiers can get on with their business. He should, when possible, not get in the soldiers way. <br />This is a marvellous account of how the Commonwealth managed to stem the Japanese tide in South-East Asia. The main part of the book describes how he managed to restore morale and discipline in the army that was so humiliatingly defeated in 1943. That part should be compulsory reading at any management school. His solution was simple: he accepted that the defeat was due to faulty planning of the general staff. He then set out to provide training and equipment to the front-line troops. Since he commanded a multi-ethnic international army, he saw that every unit was supplied according to its own special needs. He even put his own staff on half-rations if any field unit lacked provisions - which usually quickly solved the problem! <br />As few generals and politicians he understood that war is about individuals and small units - they just add up to something bigger. <br />Slim could really write, the book is full of small anecdotes and self-ironic humour. When he writes about the actions it is af we were really there in the midst of it. <br />Finally, and most importantly: the book is totally devoid of any racism or demeaning of the enemy, it is incredibly respectful of his own native soldiers and of the Japanese enemy.	2005-04-24

This one is probably the most useful one for writers who want to develop their style. Nash gives many examples of writing techniques which will help the struggling writers to express themselves in words, and, indeed, in grammar and sentence structure.

We start at the time of the Chixculub meteorite with a small primate of the species Purgatorium and continue until far far into the future. Readers of Stapleton's Last and First Men will recognize the scope. The style is somewhat, suspiciously so actually, reminicent of the BBC television series' Walking With Dinosaurs, Beasts, and Cavemen. Professor Jack Cohen, well-known and respected, in SF circles, has helped checking the facts. The science is up to 2002 standards. The only recent thing I see missing is the connection between development of language and our loss of thick body hair (this meant that kids could no longer cling on to their mothers, and they had to develop a new way of keeping track of each other).     The rise and fall of humankind is presented in a few snapshots of more or less important moments in our development.   The author makes it clear that it is fiction by adding some highly speculative accounts of tool-using dinosaurs and giant-giant flying dinosaurs.  Baxter has some interesting ideas, like that the advent of true language (subject-verb-object) went hand in hand with the discovery of reasoning and deduction, and, incidentally, with mysticism/religion.  The book is not a brainless praise of development. The theme of the book is one of ultimate doom: when we became truly human (=discovering analysis) we also sowed the seeds of our own destruction. Baxter feels that we reached our apex during the last glaciation, when we still lived in a certain harmony with our surroundings. With the advent of agriculture the book takes on a distinctively more gloomy note. The post-apocalyptic world he describes is truly nightmarish, but, unfortunately, extremely believeable. He gives a nice touch of doom when he lets the Monolith of \\"2001\\" fame appear towards the *end* of the book.	2005-04-21

Shaw is a distinguished British SF author. In this guide he assumes that the reader has overcome writer's block and know their grammar, and knows something about the mechanics of general writing. Therefore he gets down and dirty immediately into advice on how to write good SF! All his advice is geared towards starting and finishing that SF story of yours. He also gives some hints on how to distinguish between a good idea for a story and a bad idea.

MacLeod is part of a new breed of Scottish authors that manage to write for both an international and Glaswegian audience. It is as if they primarily write for their home market, but that their writing is so good that outsiders also read their books. Anyway, there is enough material here for everyones taste. Good things first. There are tonnes and tonnes of plots and subplots squeezed into a relatively thin volume - makes for exciting reading. The book is a thinly veiled satire. I do not think, for instance, that it is a conicidence that a band of street-thugs turned interplanetary entrepeneurs has the same name as a company closely affiliated with the present US administration. A company well-known for its bullish business methods.  I could fill the entire review with examples of subtle, and not so subtle, jokes about our present post-2000 \\"election\\" society. Hovewer, one group of survivors have created a kind of Hollywood society, where entertainment is the main business, and eternal youth and beauty is available to all. One playwright, somewhat similar to Shakespeare, produces plays about Breznev, Osama bin Laden, and David Koresh. In the descriptions of these plays MacLeod manage to cram more satire about just about the entire US than other writers need an entire book to do.  However, I think that MacLeod enjoyed writing this book too much - it is as he loved the details so much that he never really thought of a coherent story.  I think that if you borrowed the book from the library you might be happier than if you bought it.	2005-04-19

He skillfully uses his comic ability to make the scholarly material more accessible to laypeople, like me. Despite that it is cramped with facts and analyses it reads very easliy, and left me with wishing it had been longer. My favourite sections were the ones about the friaries that drove the financial and technological development of early middle ages, and the king that has been struck from British lists of regents.  With this book Jones wants to remedy a lot of misconceptions we have of life in the middle ages. Some, like financially astute monks and knights, are reaonably well-known, but others, like affluent peasants, sexually liberated women, and kings that served as defenders of the law, are less known. I do consider myself well-read, but there was a lot of new stuff in here for me. Even if some of his conclusions might be a bit shaky they are still of interest, and can serve as basis for further studies.  Do avoid the television series: it is very shallow and a bit incoherent because of all the unneccessary animations.	2005-04-03

The collection does not intend to give a comprehensive picture of the war, or of its participants. It is a series of snapshots of war as seen by the eyes of the ordinary people that actually fight it. Neither does the collection have literary ambitions: they have just told us their stories dircetly as they experienced them, with no special narrative technique or refinement. It actually does make the book so much more powerful. <br />Some people have complained that it is mainly about marching or waiting, well: that's what war is for ordinary soldiers: No maps, no situation reports, no overview, no moral justification. They walk in the direction they are told, the lie down when bullets start buzzing around their ears, and they try and kill the enemy before he kills them. In between actions they try and puzzle together a life away from fear. <br />Maybe we are spoilt by the magnificent war memoirs by some of the German generals, which, on the other hand, were educated cultured men with a bird's view of the war. <br />There are some especially poignant stories about meetings between British and Japanese soldiers which are far away from the Hollywood image of the raving yellow lunatics that must be killed on sight.  <br />These men and women were not so much different from the allied soldiers we are taught to revere. And, indeed, they were often hailed as liberators by the colonial subjects of the US, Britain, France, and Holland.	2005-03-20

I think that Mr Reynolds pulls that off pretty well, albeit barely. It could be a very cumbersome story, but it flows quite well. Only the cause of the machine plague does not ring believable, and could be better incorporated into the story: for example as a failed weapon against the grub-eaters. The story did hold my full attention to the end. Reynolds tries to emulate Ian Banks in this story, but does not quite make it. However, even a near success is a success when you compare with Banks Culture stories. <br />The degenerate society of Chasm City upper levels and the calculated evil of Hausmann are, in my opinion, very well developed.	2005-03-19

However, that was *not* to be: Gilbert Shelton was just too much a comic genius to stay undiscovered. I think that the best thing is that he managed to reinvent himself, while staying true to his ideal, and create a comic that (almost) anybody can enjoy.  <br />The early comics are a bit rougher on the edges, and the later ones are more streamlined mainstream. But, you can pick up just anyone and have fun. He also had the decency to stop writing when he was still on top of things. We had never to see a sad decline. <br />The adventures of the three dope addicts are just as hilarious as you can imagine. There is a certain nostalgia and romanticism of drugs, yes, but Shelton is mature enough to let us know of the bad side effects of drugs, and of the less than ideal world of the times. Don't despair however: he does it also in a funny way! <br />Try also the spin-off Fat Freddy's Cat - even funnier.	2005-03-06

Whole generations of Swedes have grown up reading his fantastic tales about Donald Duck, his nephews, Gyro Gearlose, and Scrooge McDuck. <br />Barks himself never understodd his own greatness. He thought that he only wrote dime-a-dozen stories for kids. Yet, once you are hooked on Barks you read him also as an adult - the genius is so obvious. <br />On the surface this is a simple adventure tale with comic interludes, but lurking beneath is fear and madness. This is perhaps his darkest tale. Set in an ancient Persian royal tomb. The cramped corridor, where the darkness waits just outside the circle of the torches gives a claustrophobic feel, which follows us throughout the story. <br />One moment the professor appears rational and sane, then he is revealed to be an insane megalomaniac. While the antics of the resurrected royal family are funny, there, again, are traces of hysteria and mental unbalance. <br />In the end they are so disgusted by the modern ways that they voluntarily seek oblivion in death. Donald Duck survives only by dying and being resurrected several times.  <br />The tale is funny, but it also gives the impression that the artist had far darker things in mind when he wrote it: this was the fifties, we were living in fear of the atom bomb, and what else the scientists were dreaming up in their laboratories. The tunnels and darkness are our feeling of insecurity in a world bordering on war, and our helplessness to prevent it.	2005-03-01

I could never have imagined that Frida was so Mexican that even the food from her native country  was important in her life. Diego Rivera's daughter, Guadalupe, does an excellent job describing what she saw in the year she spent living  with her father and Kahlo in \\"La Casa Azul.\\" <br /> The major strength in the book lies in the stories the author tells in relation to the dishes she introduces in each chapter, and why and when Frida ate them. You would think this is banal, but it is not: it can offer you insights into Frida's personality, her social standing, her love for her country, and sometimes her art.  <br />Another plus is the photos of the actual dishes; they are very beautiful, very colorful, but most importantly, they are taken in context, with various parts of \\"La Casa Azul\\" as the background, such as the garden and the dining room. You can almost see Frida, sitting at the table, enjoying a good conversation with her guests. <br />Finally, I have already cooked several of the dishes, and my favorite  by far is \\"Carnitas.\\" It's really tasty! <br />I highly recommend this book.

It is just as profound as the more well-known eastern paths (Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, etc.). Central is the image of the Warrior: one that sees, not just looks, one whose intentions and goals are clear. A bit like Japanese samurai. They look for the stable and constant, they are not interested in the fleeting. A Warrior is similar to a Nietschzean superhuman in that the striving is a goal in itself; whenver a goal is achieved the Warrior does not dwell but moves on. All actions must be firmly rooted in reality.  As in all paths of wisdom there are seeming contradictions: Warriors should understand what is really going on around them, but should not be lost in introspection. Maybe it is so that a Warrior must have the ability to extract the important from the important. There are many quotes that will help the wanderer.	2005-02-24

I liked it from page one. It is written in an easy conversational tone, and is full to the brim of Ms. George's tricks of the trade. I like her idea of sketching the characters first and then build a story around them, which is really the best way of writing if you think about it. She also give very down to earth advice on how to structure chapters, paragraphs, and even sentences for best results. The ideas are intuitively very clever, so it would be very little effort for anyone to incorporate them in their writing.  Ms. George is a mystery writer, but the book is written for the a general writing audience. If their is one complaint I have it is that the examples are very long, too long. They would work to better effect if they were shorter. It is almost as if she wanted to fill out space.

There is not one version of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, there are at least five, soon six, official versions: the original radio series (I think there are even two versions of the radio series), the transcript of the radio series, the vinyl record (a treat if you can get hold of it!), the books, the television series, and soon the film. All are different, and developed for their respective mediums. All are fantastic. Douglas Adams himself said that there is no definite version. If the film is any good people will want to pick up the books also, so this is a word of caution that they should not expect the film to follow the books.   The books are very funny, extremely cleverly written, and also very thought provoking. If you read them just expecting some clear cut fun you might be in for a shock. The books have a complex intrigue and several subplots, can be read on many levels, and they seem to want to reveal something to the reader, but it is always just out of grasp. Since the seeming message of the books is never revealed, the reader instead is left wondering: What is the message? Which turns out to be the message! The closest we come is \\"42\\" and God's final message to his creation, neither of which is very ehaustive...  The universe described is not the cosy universe of science: cause and effect have no meaning since you can travel through time and space and change everything anyway. Small actions have enormous reprecussions, but apparently monumetous events leave no mark on the space-time continuoum whatsoever. Nothing is what it first seems: the Earth is run by mice, Arthur Dent has created and destroyed civilizations, but humanity as a whole is totally unimportant (not to mentioned descended from hairdressers!), the role of the galactic president is not to wield power - it is to draw attention away from the real power (a premonition of Dubya's presidency?)!  The Hitchhiker's Guide itself becomes a symbol of our struggle to create order where no order exists, it is a source of false comfort (just like organised religion, which seems to be the theme of the film).   The books, like few others, really create a sense of wonder, a feeling of the infinite. Douglas Adams was a very clever man and with a lot of life experience, therefore he could write such a complex, and funny, book.	2005-02-22

Now, with a global civilization, we are facing an ecological disaster on a global scale. Diamond is very clever at writing his book now, when we can still do something about it. He brings to life civilizations who destroyed their environement, and therefore disappeared. He tries to explain that these societies were not evil, or stupid, or even careless, but that they failed to see the signs of the destruction they caused. We, however, can recognize the signs of the havoc we wreak. Some societies, like Iceland or Japan, recognized long ago the signs of enivronmental degradation. They have survived and are now among the most succesful societies around.  <br />Diamond makes us ask ourselves if we will be like the ancient Mayans, whose civilization collapsed because of overpopulation and poor resource management, or like the abovementioned Japanese. <br />Also, more chilling, several civilazations collapsed because trading partners collapsed. Again what will happen, in our global society where everyone is linked to everyone else via a trade network, if a major player collapses because of poor management of resources?	2005-02-16

Douglas Adams was a very interesting and intelligent man whose life was cut tragically short. The story of how his most famous work was created is almost as funny and capticating as the Hitchiker's Guide itself.

Both are excellent, and they are still read today. I can highyl recommend them. They are even in the same fantasy genre as Lord of the Rings, and both Anderson and Tolkien drew on the same nordic mythology. Why is then Lord of the Rings so outstandingly popular? Especially Gormenghast rivals LOTR in complexity and brilliance. Maybe the answer lies in the fact that Tolkien poured all of his soul in his books. These are not mere books; they *are* Tolkien. I have heard that Tolkien wrote to escape a dreary life - therefore he created the ultimate escape fantasy. I remember how hypnotised I was as a child reading them. Tolkien weaves such a rich tapestry that as in no other fantasy book have I ever felt that the author is describing a real world. The only book I can think about that comes close is Frank Herbert's Dune, but it is also obviously inspired by LOTR.<br /><br />So, the combination of a will to create a fantasy world to escape to with the imagination and education to do it and a remarkable writing ability has created a literary masterpiece. I think that he created the modern fantasy genre with these books, and all role-playing games up until the mid-eighties were directly modelled on Middle-Earth.<br /><br />However, I must add that I have some caveats: The moral of the books is rather primitve - static rural countryside/good, dynamic industrial society/bad. There is a total dualism; you are either with the good guys or with the bad guys (and gosh, are the bad guys BAD!). There has also been a lot of commercial exploitation of Tolkien; his family has published material that was never supposed to be published, and I fear that it is more driven by money than respect for his legacy.	2005-02-09

I'm not an experienced crocheter, but I'm already working on my second pair of socks. The instructions are so clearly explained that even when I'm left handed I don't have any problems following the patterns. My first pair of socks fit me so well, and are so warm... it's a delight to wear them, especially in the Alaskan winter!  <br />While it is true the yarns the authors recommend are difficult to find,  I have used other brands with no ill results; the only thing I had to do was to adjust the gauge.  <br />This book is an excellent buy.

Despite the forward warning of the German attack and a meticulous planning by the Stavka the Germans made good headway and suffered light losses compared to the Soviets. Instead, it was the Soviet couterattacks at other sectors of the front that forced the Germans to break of the offensive. The Germans simply did not posses the manpower necessary to attack on one sector and defend against massive Soviet attacks on another. <br />There is a companion volume, unfortunately in Swedish only still, that deals exhaustively with their re-evaluation of the battle on the basis of the statistics. Their conclusion is that the German more flexible organisation and command system was far superior to the Soviet system, but with the numbers turning against them it did not help.	2005-02-05

I fear that the film will remove everything that is good, which is not unusual for Hollywood anyway! First of all I have serious doubts about Keanu Reeves as Constantine. Why not Jude Law?   John Constantine, is a punk-gothic anti-hero. He has a conscience, but it is hidden behind too much cynicism, alcohol, and tobacco. He has seen too much. His world is not the cosy world of nine-to-five jobs, or simple cause and effect. He is a mage, albeit a minor one. In the comics he is first and foremost a facilitator. He is one of the few that can move freely in both 'normal' and supernatural society. Of course, that leaves a twisted mind.  What really made this comic stand how it delivered its political message. All stories in this collection are very political, but they deliver their message in a very allegorical form. They chill me out because they capture so well the atmosphere of the 1980s, or the 2000s for that matter! The portray a spiritual poverty that opens up doors for forces both from heaven and hell to enter and exploit.   Some stories deal with the people that are just out to make money, other, more frightening stories, deal with the forces of hell and heaven that are trying to take over our daily lives. Yuppies are created by demons from hell and satan worshippers sacrifice runaway children. By far the most dangerous threat is posed by the well-organised and fanatical christian fundamentalists. Try the truly shocking story \\"When Johnny comes marching home\\" which deals with the scars left by the Vietnam war on the US. This is my favourite since it really transcends the classical horror genre and creates something truly new. It is not rotting corpses coming back - it is something so much worse that comes back...  The drawings can be very evocative, capturing extremely well the grime and filth of industrial England. Sometimes they are bland, but sometimes they are extremely evocative and powerful.  I just want to add that this review is for the first book only; the other ones are not half as good.  John Constantine is also a minor character in the comics Swamp Thing, Books of Magic, and Sandman.	2005-02-03

I have always liked the way he includes hard science in his books, enough to come up with a plausible story. A trademark of a superior story-teller; his ideas might not be correct, but they are believable. In all his previous books, however, the science has always served as a background to his stories. Here he reverses - instead of writing he starts preaching against accpeted science. Why does he have to include notes and explanations? I would not have had a problem with this book if Mr Crichton had limited himself to a thought-experiment, but he seems to claim that he is not writing fiction. Had he stated that it is only fiction I would have given the book four stars.  I see that several reviewers see this book as proof of the death of global warming. I ask them: if the weatherreport predicted sun, but it is raining - would you leave your house without an umbrella? and claim it is an illusion that they get soaked? Denying global warming is really like fleeing from reality.  It is also a fact that people opposed to the idea of global warming has difficulties getting published in refereed journals. That is not because of bias - it is because of their flawed science. Instead they publish in magazines and talk at special interest forums. It is the back-door way to spread their ideas.	2004-12-20

It may be due to the fact that the book's popularity invites too many \\"free\\" translations and \\"interpretations\\". This book is more unknown, but that means that the translation is a bit more scholarly. Wen-Tzu does explain essential aspects of taoism, and how to include them in your everyday life. He is clear where Lao Tzu is obscure, and practical where Lao Tzu is philosophical. Simplistic, but not simple - all of these teachings are easy to understand, but take years to really sink in.	2004-12-20

It is not the purpose of the book. The purpose of the book is to make the reader think for themselves. I find the book a comforting read - it gives hope and meaning to everyone that is dissatisfied with the answers given by organized religion, political parties, or just the usual howling mobs of sheep that think that just because they are members of a group they are wolves. <br />Nietzsche probably understood suffering and loss better than most, but he also understood hope better than most. True spiritual strength does not come from religious dogma or membership of a group. It comes from within, we all have it. For Nietzsche the only eternal truth is that we should always work for our betterment. We need no God or Leader to tell us what to do. In the end Nietzsche wants us to reject even him - he cannot tell us what we should do! <br />It can be said that horrible crimes have been committed in Nietzsche's name, but can we ignore that even more horrible crimes have been committed in God's or Allah's name? Or in the guise of \\"the common good\\" so favoured by our politicians?	2004-12-19

An astronomer registers a signal from outer space. The characteristics of the signal hint that the senders have immense power at their disposal, and that they are arriving in three months...  This book is about how this fact changes the life of the astronomer and the people around her. We also get a glimpse of the political situation in the world of her day, and the book has its fair share of political satire.  The book is well written and in many ways believable, but I can also recognize some of the sources of inspiration for the author: Will Eisner's Life on Another Planet most notably, but also Fred Pohl's The Day the Martians Came. Both are better, but that does not mean that The Coming is bad.	2004-12-12

It turns out that Mel Gibson got the name of William Wallace right, and his stubborn refusal to yield to Edward Longshanks right, but not much else.  Scotland had enjoyed almost a century of internal peace under the kings David I, Alexander II, and Alexander III. When Alexander III died without a male heir the Scottish nobles became uneasy: even if Scotland had stabilized under \\"the Good King\\" Alexander, it was still an unruly place with ambituos noblemen and aggresive norse lords in the north and west. When his daughter (the maid of Norway) died in Orkney 1290, the [...] hit the fan - now the throne was up for grabs.   This book describes the old-fashioned political system of the Scottish kingdom, and why it became so vulnerable in a succesional crisis. It then continues with the complex political games in the crisis of the succesion - nobles switched allegiance as often as we change underwear. It is an interesting fact how international the Scottish crisis was: claimants to the throne came from Norway, Flanders, France, and England. The political intruiguing involved not only England and Scotland, but also Gwynnedd, Irish sub-kings, France, Holy Roman Empire, Scandinavia, and the Papal curia. William Wallace turns out to have been a comparatively minor character in all this.  Sometimes the sheer number of names is overwhelming, and there is a lack of pictures. The writing is a bit dry, and the subject gets a very, almost too, scholarly treatment.  The main strengths of the book, I think, are that the author thoroughly describes the causes of the political crisis that led to the wars and that he puts them into their European context.	2004-12-11

This was something completely new.  <br />Mr Donaldson, being the son of doctor, understood profoundly well the mental agony of leprosy victims. Covenant's disease has taken over his life so totally that everything has to circle around it. What happens then when suddenly he is cured? Is he happy? No, it is a psychological disaster for him. Covenant's struggle to come to terms with his newfound health, which he knows is only fleeting, is superbly dealt with in the first triology. <br />Then, I fear, it has gone downhill. There is too much 'woe betides me' and mental anguish.  <br />There are some very good ideas here: The return of Covenant's son and the stubborn idiocy of the Haruchai for instance. On the other hand, I wish Linden Avery could get her act together: there is to much 'woe, woe is me' instead of action from her side, and to many times when her indecision has led her companions close too disaster a miracle 'unexpectedly' turns up and they are saved. <br />Mr Donaldson sure does not lack great ideas, and this story shows great promise, but I think he could cut down a bit on Linden Avery's feeling of inadequacy. She could, for instance, learn to ask her companions for advice; they are capable enough to give her intelligent answers.	2004-12-07

This book is dictatorship and the struggle against it. The dictator is Charlemange, and the opposition is led by newly conquered Lombard nobles. It is not a book about ninth century Europe - it is a book about our own times. Dictatorships are all the same, even if they are known by different names. The struggle against them is also timeless; even an oppressed nobleman is still oppressed!  The methods of dictatorships remain the same also: torture, disappearances, secret police, concentration camps, etc. The book could rank with 1984, George Orwell was also an apostate from communism. <br />This book got Eyvind Johnson in trouble with the cultural elite in Sweden: they saw it as an attack on the Soviet Union. The author had been an ardent communist, but after visiting Stalinist Russia he denounced it as just another dictatorship, and that communism was a sham. The treatment he received form his former friends forced him to commit suicide.	2004-12-06

The early books were pleasantly gruesome, and had a quite intelligent idea on how a society where the occult does exist would function. Sex was always in the background; humans would be drawn to the vampires, and the vampires would be all to happy to oblige - at a price. <br />Human relations were only at a business level, also something that would suit a fearless vampire hunter.  <br />Now, the characters spend most of their with jealous bickering and sex games. Every few pages there is a snippet of story, which is quite good, but too little of it.  <br />Ms Hamilton tries to make her characters three dimensional and realistic, but I fear she succeeds only in watering out the stories and writing second rate human relations dramas and sex manuals.	2004-11-29

I wondered how he could claim to write about nearly everything, and how he would structure it. I am glad to say that he pulled it off marvelously! The book is really a story about how you and I came to be the persons we are. To know that we must know about the laws of physics, about the atoms, and about the universe. We need to know about the geology of Earth, and of the laws biology and genetics. It all adds up to a quite long, but eminently readable book. Bryson can write, and since he start out from a layman, him being a journalist, he asks the right people the right questions. The book is written in an easy-going narrative. He starts from basics, and when we know enough about one topic, he switches over to the next step in his explanation. So the book actually has a red thread, it reads like a novel.  <br />However, there is more to it: the book is also about the nature of scienc and of scientific research. For every major discovery he also tells us about the discoverers, and their times. Some of the scientists described were odd characters indeed! We also get to know about the controversies surrounding many discoveries and of the major fights that have developed between researchers. Many scientists have their pet theories, and they defend them like devils. Scientific truth can be very relative. <br />The facts seem on the whole to be correct; I am a geophysicist, and he seems to have gotten both his physics and geosciences correct. That would indicate that he has gotten his other facts correct also.	2004-11-23

I was a bit worried when I borrowed it, since it is always dangerous to reread the stories you enjoyed as a child - maybe they have paled, and the memory is better than the original story?  I am glad to say that the stories are just as good as they were! I think that that is a trademark of a really good tale: to enjoy it both when you are young, and when are older.  All the major tales are here, inluding the seminal Call of Cthulhu and Pickman's Model, and the mindbogglingly shocking The Rats in the Walls, In the Wault, and The Picture in the House. It also comes with a learnt foreword by Robert Bloch, explaining Lovecraft's metaphysics and his legacy.  There are some notable exclusions, like The Tomb, The Statement of Randolph Carter, The Horror at Red Hook, and The Hound. It is difficult to draw a line between the 'good' stories and the 'bad' stories though, so it is no oversight by the editors.  Lovecraft really broke with traditional horror in his stories. Absent are the vampires, werewolves , and ghost. Absent is the belief in God and the belief in the ultimate victory of good. Absent is any hope of redemption, and, indeed, hope itself. The horror, instead, lies in the futility of our endevours. Even out belief in science as our salvation is taken away from us: The more mighty our science gets, the more it can be used as a tool for our destruction. The more we know, the closer we get to revelation and insanity. The heroes/narrators/victims in these stories are always seekers of knowledge. Sometimes they straddle the divide between science and magic and unleash horrors beyond their understanding, sometimes they look into strange happenings, and unearth knowledge that should have stayed hidden. In Lovecraft, the enlightment is closely linked to madness. Our very search for knowledge condemns us to our destruction.	2004-10-27

They are not coming from a spin machine. I was surprised at my reaction. I could not read it in one go. I had to digest every letter; I also thought that the writers deserved it.  <br />I also get reminded of another book, from another army fighting for a questionable cause.

Kerry served in Vietnam, honourably in both senses. He got wounded three times - which meant his tour of duty was over, and he got a medal for bravery. However, he also served honourably in that he questioned the actions of his fellow soldiers. Just this story about how they were supposed to treat local fishermen; Kerry was disgusted. Does that show a flip-flopper? Kerry's even greater moment of bravery came when he stood up against the establishment and spoke out. This book is more than an ordinary biography, it also covers the brown water corps, and it is also a story about an intelligent young man that learns that life is more complex than he was tought.  Contrary to what the detractors of the book claims there are plenty of sources, not just Kerry's war diaries. The writing is actually quite riveting, Brinkley can write, but still sober.

He vey much uses \\"I\\", in short: he personalizes the state a la Luis XIV. If you question Dubya, you question the US. The he uses statements that are either sweeping, or detailed. Both difficult to contradict, since they are not actually false, but not actually true either. He paints everything in black and white, right or wrong. Kerry, when in a more statesmanlike manner, tries to say that for a president, things cannot be that simple, gets mocked. <br />Enough on that. Many chapters detail the calculated lies of the administration. Some of them are overly detailed, but that just make them so much more painful to read. Luckily there are several cartoons, Dubya gaffes and quotes, and games included in the book, to give the reader the relief fo laughter. The most shocking facts are left to last: the republican spin doctors use the fact that americans want to believe that the US President is doing his best for the country. By careful spin and propaganda they have twisted the mindframe of Americans so that questioning Dubya is equal to questioning the US Constitution or the American Way of Life. Of course, media gets its share too. Bush is treated much more lenient by the media than any other president. <br />Scary stuff.	2004-10-09

Listen, you are holed up in a cabin, surrounded by rather disgusting rotting vampires, lots and lots of them. You try to survive, right? Not in this book: the main characters starts bickering about who sleeps with who, and, even more important - why this one does not sleep with me! Get real! Ms. Blake does act more like a stubborn child than a fearless, and dangerous, vampire slayer. OK, some of it is relevant: the werewolves need to know who is alpha, so some testing is alright there, and the poor wereleopards have been so sexually abused that they cannot relate to other people in any other way, so that's also good (a very good point actually). But, come on, you don't think it is sexy looking at a vampire drinking from someone that is rotting alive, however naked he is! <br />I feel that a lot of the tension from the earlier books are gone, and replaced by \\"Survivor\\"-like squabbling.	2004-10-03

Vampire politics it not for the faint hearted, and woe to the one that is caught in the net.  <br />The main strong point of the book is Ms. Hamilton's description of where human and vampire society meet: some humans are drawn towards the vampires; some are fascinated by the promise of eternal life, others find them sexually attractive. The vampires are not slow to define their niche: whatever the humans want from them, they provide, at a price... Ms. Hamilton's descriptions of the murky world of vampire churches which literally promise eternal lives and seedy nightclubs where humans and vampires can live out their sexual fantasies on each other are truly nightmarish.	2004-10-03

Clausewitz reads more like a typical western school book. Sun-Tzu is more akin to Buddhist thinkers - he gives you the ideas and the basics, but you are left to work out the details. They complement each other very well. What Clausewitz understood, and it is still so difficult for certain presidents to grasp, is that war is a last resort; it must have a definite, and achievable goal; the the way to achieve that goal is by decisively defeating the enemy!    Clausewitz stress land battle as the way to defeat an enemy. Even with the advent of trade embargoes, naval blockades, and strategic bombing, the land battle has proved to be the decisive factor.   Clausewitz only managed to edit the first book of On War before he died. The others were just compiled and published by his widow, and I am afraid it shows. That is why so many editions just feature the first book. The others are a drag to read! Still, there are so much wisdom here! A few highlights include:  - the passage describing the recruits first exposure to battle, which is chillingly detailed and gruesome.  - the statement that it is not the attacking nation that wants the war, it is the defending nation! The aggressor would be just as happy annexing the defendor quietly! The corollaries here are mindboggling.   - poloticians must start the war, but it is the generals that must end it (negotiated peace is not an option)  In some ways Clausewitz is a bit dated. He concentrates on land war, and, I assume, he could not predict the cold war and the rise of the military-industrial complex, which desires a permanent state of almost war. Something that would have abhorred the noble old Prussian general.  Still, no one has lost a war by following the advice of Clausewitz.	2004-09-30

It is also an excellent guidebook to the Appalachian Trail. Since both Bryson and, the by now infamous Katz, are middle-aged and out of shape, it gives the reader a good sense of what it really is like to hike it. <br />Bryson does not do anything half-hearted; he has read up extensively on all kinds of facts surrounding the trail - nature, about hiking, the politics of the trail, cultural history, the US as a whole. All journeys have an inner and outer aspect. The outer aspect here is how it is walking the trail and what you expect to encounter along the route. The inner aspect is that he uses the all the facts he has found out about the trail to make it a journey through the US of today. Just this worry that there have been three murders (five when the book is over) along the trail, and they worry about their safety when Katz observes that you can draw a random line through the US and there have been at least three murders along that line! <br />The first part of the book reads like a triumph - they manage to walk and experience nature in all its glory. The second part is more like a descent into hell: Katz deteriorates, and Bryson continues part of the trail on his own. The trail cuts through more \\"civilized\\" areas up in the north, and there he encounters all the follies of modern man: civil war battlefields, hikers with more gadgets than sense, hikers that defy all description, senseless murders, derelict hotels and resorts, and Centralia. Centralia is something you would expect coming out of the pens of King or Lovecraft, not something that actually exists! <br />Bryson can be very sarcastic and cynical at times. I think that that is the curse of the very kind and intelligent man he is (I have met him) - he is very distraught by the idiocy of his fellow men.	2004-09-30

He is also very informative. This is one of his early books, he has not yet really found his style. <br />Mr. Bryson travels through continental Europe. His journey has two purposes: he wants to write about Europe, and he wants to relieve a journey he made in his youth with, the by now infamous, Katz. His inner journey is a middle-aged man trying to remember his youth, even if you sometimes wonder if he has really grown out of it! His outer journey lets him experience the feel of all the places he visits. That is by far the best aspect of the book! Here he is no-holds barred funny! He can pinpoint the national bad habits of every country he visits. Since he also lets us know about his own bad habits it is not insulting. There is a love and a respect hidden among all his writings. He loves travelling, and he loves all places he visits. He seems to have a nack for capturing the soul of the places he visits. His books can almost be used as travel guides.	2004-09-29

This book is a gentle read, far from hue and cry of the republican propaganda machine. Kerry does not come out as 100% inspiring, but do we really want a 100% inspiring guy as president? I mean Hitler, Stalin, and those lads were 100% inspiring, idea-driven, and idealistic. Much good they did to the world... Why would we need someone that sways the masses at well-coordinated rallies? Whay cannot we have a guy that does his job, and let the rest of us do our jobs? That is what Kerry outlines in this book! He wants the rest of the world to get along with the US, he wants the rich to give up a little bit, nothing painful, so that the poor can improve their lot. He does not promise paradise, but he promises a less ideological and less intrusive vision than certain other presidential candidates. Kerry's vision is inclusive, he does not exclude undesirables.   He can be a bit wordy sometimes, but he is still clear, and, fundamentally - he can put two words together and form a sentence! He also understands that yeeha makes a good slogan, but does not really make for good politics.	2004-09-29

Antarctic explorers are exploring a mountain range beyond the Transantarctic range. What they find there destroys their sanity. So far typical Lovecraft stuff. But in no other story is his worldview so well-presented. We have the cosy, predictable, and logical world of the scientists. They are exploring the unknown, but they expect it to fit into their worldview, they just want to expand their microroom, the world they know. Instead, they find the totally unexpected, the unexplainable, the bizarre, the diseased, and, instead, they have to redefine the macroroom, their place in the universe, and, in extension, so does the reader. We turn from being the crown of creation to gnats in a hurricane, or one fly in a cloud of flies buzzing around a rotting elephant carcass.  The mountainranges described are borders. The Transantractic range defines the limit of the known, the Mountains of Madness defines the limit of sanity, and shockingly, at the end of the story, it is hinted at an even further mountain range - the border to what? We are afraid to ask.  Lovecraft's style, as even his most ardent fans know, leaves much to be desired. He was not a great author, but he was a storyteller. He also understood the contrast between our ordered modern society and the unknown, or the unknowable, or insane, as no other author.  This is perhaps his most complex story. It can be interpreted in many ways: what is our place in the universe? What laws govern the universe? What happens when we delve into the unknown? Is it an allegory on the subconscious? How can we claim that we posses all the answers, or even questions? etc.  It should be no surprise that the book is an almost must with modern Antarctic explorers. Another thing that tends to forgotten is that Lovecraft wrote at the same time as Kafka, and in many ways they are exploring the same territory.	2004-09-28

The Ogata is a Japanese American family coming to terms with the death of their mother. Ivah, the oldest daughter, takes on the role of mother and caretaker to her younger siblings, Blu, a fat boy who grieves by eating too much, and Maisie,a sweet little girl who stops talking. Their father, Poppy, is too busy grieving the death of his wife to pay attention to the kids. Alone in the world, they must fend for themselves against the harsh realities of life, from sexual molesters to people who have nothing for them but  contempt. The use of Pidging English gives authenticity to the  main characters, especially Blu, with all his wordly wisdom. I can almost feel he is sitting next to me, and not Maisie, giving his opinion about many things that happen to him and others. With no adult to guide his life, he makes his own conclusions about everything he sees, from sex to religion. The book is full of bad language and very graphic descriptions of, for instance, sex and animal abuse. I had to stop reading many times because it was too painful to go on, and yes, I cried a lot, Sad to say, the author received a lot of criticism after the publication of this book, especially because of the depiction she does of the Filipino American community as sexual deviants. However, the Japanese and Caucasian characters of her book do not fare very well neither, and rather than criticise the author, one should applaud her courage for bringing up topics that are too convinient to ignore, but difficult to hide, such as the poverty many people still live under, not only in America, but basically everywhere else in the world. <br />I give Blu's Hanging a four out of five, because sometimes the book has a \\"soap opera\\" feeling to it, with cheesy bits here and there. Otherwise, kudos to the author, who dares describe the not very nice side of life in Hawaii.	2004-09-26

While Mr. Anthony sticks to the theme of refugees the book is great. Now he models our hero's experiences on Mexican migrant workers in the US. Indeed, Hubris starts out as fruit picker before he is drafted into the army. <br />Again, the setting of the story is just great. Jupiter is corrupt, the army is corrupt and covertly racist. The promised paradise turns out to be a Potemkin facade. Still, Hubris falls under the influence of some very competent officers and is pushed upwards towards his own command. <br />The main weakness of the book is the characterisation of Hubris himself: he is not sufficiently scarred by his experiences in the refugee bubble. Either there is a ploy from the author, or just a miss. The only hang-up he has is a slight sexual one (he cannot harm a woman). So, the book misses a bit on the psychology of Hubris, which harms it, since that should be such a vital part of explaining his later actions.	2004-09-24

Their goal is the promised land of Jupiter. On their way they are betrayed by greedy human traffickers, attacked, again and agian, by pirates, turned back by a suddenly xenophobic Jupiter, before finally given refugee status. <br />Mr. Anthony has, and I think very well, captured the plight of the very real refugees that roam the world of today. I think I recognize all the incidents described from news reports. The Jupiter of the book is a thinly disguised USA. It could be Germany, Sweden, the UK, or any other western country that promises as safe haven, but grows xenophobic when they did not anticipate the flow of refugees fleeing from dictators, corruption, poverty, disease, and war. Often fleeing from situations created by the countries they are fleeing to! <br />So, even if the reading is grisly sometimes, it is no imagination. This book is actually very political. These are the experiences that will influence the future tyrant.	2004-09-24

In a US where many citizens have a knee jerk reaction to critisism of the president this is a very brave book to write. There seems to be a confusion in the First Commandment - it says that you should have no other God than me, not President! <br />It seems that Kerry can be questioned (well, slandered actually), but not Bush. That the Bush family have a lot of secrets is fairly well-known, if you have eyes to see that is. If you follow independent media, a lot of this is old news. This book is not treasonous. Kelley does note cite all her sources, but then, neither do the Kerry slanderers. Why does not Bush come clear on many of these allegations? Is it because they are true? If they are wrong, then say so. Do not hide behind McLellan and Fox News. <br />This book should open a debate about what the Bush family is hiding. Not a debate about whether Kelley's sources are lying. The House could spend more money on the Whitewater investigation than they spend on the 9/11 investigation; they could spend a few greenbacks on the Bush dealings also. I think there is more than even Ms. Kelley lets out. Personally I found the book a bit on the soft side. We can read books about the secret lives of Kennedy and Roosveldt, but not on the Bushes or Reagan.	2004-09-20

This was the first Anita Blake Vampire Hunter story I read, and I am pleasantly surprised. The mood and the storyline are brilliant.  <br />The inspirations for the Anita Hill series seem to be Buffy, obvious, White Wolf's game series The World of Darkness, where our ancient nightmares rule us from nightopen office buildings and glitzy nightclubs. The final touches are a bit of hardboiled detective dialogue and hardboiled feminism. It works. <br />So I like the storytelling, and I like the idea and the result. I have some problem with the character of Anita Blake; on the whole the characterization of Ms. Blake and the other role figures is good. However, I find her just a tad bit to aggressive and arrogant towards people she does not like. In her business, dealing with extremely powerful supernatural beings, it pays off being a bit diplomatic - especially when in their lair. I suppose that the main target group of the books, young wonen, like that, and who am I to argue that? <br />On the whole, a really good read, and I look forward reading more of the books in this series.	2004-09-14

Wrong, says Hobsbavn - only an epoch has ended. The short twentieth century, the age dominated by war. Hobsbavn revolutionised history by refusing to adhere to the somewhat artificial restraint of centuries. Instead he has split up the ninetenth and twentieth centuries in four distinct epochs. And does it work! This was his fourth book on the subject, and it created quite a stir when it came out. <br />In retrospect it seems obvious to say that up until 1991 we lived in an age that were stillsuffering from the effects of the first world war. Hobsbawn even claims that the first world war did not really end until 1991. Now we have entered an era which is ruled by other historical processes. <br />Hobsbawn is a socialist, but he does not rub it in, in this book at least. Rather, he, for me at least, comes out as a very clear thinker. He is not stuck in ideology, especially when he praises Ronald Reagan, or the northern European monarchies. His ideas about art during the age of extremes are interesting, but are bound to provoke; are the only operas of note during the twentieth century really just King Ubu and Peter Grimes?	2004-09-12

Mr. Reynolds weave as a complex a universe and tells a story as intricate and complex as any. The characters are quite well drawn, and the universe of revelaton space is interesting. I highly recommend it as a holiday, or airflight read. <br />The issue I had with the book is that there is very little really new in it. I recognize a bit of Clark, a bit of Vance, a bit of this and a bit of that. Reynolds is no Mieville. I do not think he aims to be one either though. He seems to be very aware of his sources of inspiration. Also, he blissfully avoids all childish sex that fills most other science fiction books nowadays. <br />I also think he throws to much in. The book almost becomes a collage of ideas and events with very little cement between them. I will now start reading Chasm City to see if that book is more solid.	2004-09-12

This translation attempts to show that that is not really true. The translators and editors explain in the foreword that the Chinese language is dynamic, and therefore Confucius sayings does not reflect a static society, but rather a society in a constant flux. It does come out that Confucius will not tolerate revolution, but he does accept evolution. He is not preaching a static society, but rather that all development should build on the previous. <br />While he stresses the importance of ritual, he also hammers in that ritual must be combined with warmth, caring, and even humour. A more gentle, less rigid, Confucius appears in this translation. <br />Lastly, I think Confucianism relates to Daoism as Shaolin relates to t'ai ch'i (or Bruce Lee to Yang Cheng Fu): on is concerned with the external, and one with the internal. It is just a matter of which way you chose. Ones you have achieved mastery, there is no difference.	2004-08-17

Schwarzkopf's \\"It doesn't take a hero.\\" Neither Franks nor Schwarzkopf are what they call 'political generals'; unlike Powell, for instance. In that, Franks comes out as honest. I think I found Schwarzkopf's book more intriguing. The problem with the military mind is that it works linearly. It cannot cope with the intricate and convoluted 'political mind.' Therefore generals have very little defence against manipulative politicians. Both Franks and Schwarzkopf can be honest decent soldiers that  fought wars for questionable reasons. History is full of examples of that, <br />You can like Franks, and be impressed by his military skill, but still disagree with the Iraqi war. <br />However, I think the story has been airbrushed. It is difficult to write a book about a contentious war during an election year. Franks only dare to be a little critical about Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeldt, when, in reality, he was probably cursing all their incompetence. Schwarzkopf's book was edited to remove some political incorrect actions of him. Also, most but not quite all, references to the then Bush administration were removed: Schwarzkopf does tell us outright that Cheney wanted to occupy Iraq already then. Also, Schwarzkopf had much more experience with the Arabs than Franks: he would not have allowed the mistakes made in the post-war planning.	2004-08-09

Fantastic Metropolis is a fantastic idea, and I am sure it will help science fiction much in the years to come. Science Fiction, as I see it, is in desperate need of some new ideas. These are people that are more inspired by Merwyn Peake than by Tolkien. They want more intelligent and stylistically advanced science fiction. Now, that is difficult, since it must also be readable. In this sampler I much preferred the editorials and non-fiction over the short stories! I feel that in their creative joy, some authors have missed out on plots or interesting stories. Science Fiction is, at the heart of it, based on plot, not characterization or style. On the other hand, modern scince fiction is deperately lacking in both. I hope that in the future the editors of Fantastic Metropolis will manage to create a viable fusion. So, my verdict is that buy it to read the interesting editorials, and to suport the work of the Fantastic Metropolis website.	2004-08-08

These books were originally written at the same time as Lord of The Rings. There are many similarities; the rich and complex settingss, the well-described characters, and the use of of language. After all, both Tolkien and Peake were educated men. There the similarities end. Tolkien's inspiration seems to be the medieval heroic epics and fairy tales, where Peake's inspiration seems to be eighteenth century gothic horror stories. Gormghast is a wast labyrinthic fortress/city/palace. It had its heyday long before our tale starts. Now, most of Gormenghast is abandoned, left to shadows and rot. Only a small part is inhabited by the inbred ruling family and their retainers. Whatever creative spirit and vitality that are left are drowned in ancient meaningless rituals and childish political intrigue.  <br />Such is the setting. The story first centres around the ruthless machinations of a kitchen boy to advance his status in this staid society. At first glance, we sympathize with his struggle, then we are revolted, but in the end: how does his vitality compare with the staid society he tries to usurp?  <br />In the last book, Titus Alone, we follow the young heir to Gormenghast in his travels in the outside world. This is not Fantasy as we know it, here Peake breaks new ground. Outside Gormenghast the world has moved on; we have no  feudal lords - we have ruthless industrialists! The Fantasy becomes a surrealist social commentary of Peake's own era. It is weird, and at first disconcerting, but the more I think about it, the better it becomes. <br />This is not \\"sword and sorcery' or a classic 'the heroe's journey,' it is something unique, and unjustly forgotten.	2004-08-08

They disappear and are never heard of again. Bellis, a minor character in Perdido Street Station, understands that she is on the list, and will be caught soon. She tries to escape to one of New Cobuzon's new colonies. However, she is again trapped by events. Here, New Crobuzon is but one player in the Great Game of international intrigue, and not even the strongest, or most bizarre, one. <br />The story is as complex and esoteric as anything Frank Herbert could produce, and the colour reminds us of Vance when he is at his best. We also have some touches of sixties satirical SF writing. The characters are better described than in his previous book, and they develop as the book progresses. Mieville is one of the few author's I know that dare make plot and characters 'realisitc.' Our perception of the main players change as the story progresses, some characters we thought were unimportant become important, others we thought were good turns out to be baddies, and vice versa. Most just are, and they enter and disappear, but still leave an impression on the reader, since Mieville lets us see that they are also people, with their own stories, and have as much right to be heard as the main characters. <br />The plot twists and turns, other subplots are brought in, surprises are sprung on the reader, but, it works. The book works. It is much stronger than Perdido Street Station. The Scar is, to mee, a more mature, a tighter, book. Plot and setting work better together here. <br />I think that we will hear more from this author, and from other that will be inspired by his writing. We need something new and fresh.	2004-08-07

Dubya lives in a created reality. He is constantly surrounded by cheering crowds and supportive advisors. In this world, Dubya sets the agenda, he sets the rules. It is a kind of relativistic universe where the ruler's that measure Dubya and Kerry are of different length. Dubya's falls from his mountainbike, absence from his military service, drug habits, gaffes, etc., just shows his greatness, while every time Kerry shows that he not quite has the wisdom of Confucius, the intelligence of Einstein, and the strength of Conan the Barbarian it proves that he is unfit to be president.   This book is a must for the undecided voter, or even for the soft-core republican who knows that something is wrong, but cannot really identify what.	2004-08-06

It was perhaps a third wave in the modern genre, anfter the blind belief in progress of the fifties, and the dystopian visions of the sixties and seventies. Greg Bear is but one great name of that era. He wrote several very different books. Perhaps Forge of God is one of the best. Bear is here reminiscent of Clarke with his vision of a wast uncaring universe which impacts on an unsuspecting humanity. He does introduce hope, as a few humans are saved - not out of any altruism, but as recruits in the hunt for the shadowy civilization that runs amok among the stars. <br />Many characters in the book die. I think he wants to stress that hope and success go hand in hand with failure and disappointment. And, sometimes, being a little person, your part tend to be little, but it is still an important part.  <br />This book has served as an inspiration for the fim Independence Day.	2004-08-05

Moorcock and Mieville are wellknown and respected. The problem I had with the book is that crossing Proust and hard science fiction does not always work. The stories are all too wordy, and lacks in plot. Mieville and Moorcock almost pulls it off, with Mievielle's nightmare vision of a London overrun by mirror-images, and Moorcock's story about a post-apocalyptic USA. Maybe if I would be more familiar with Jerry Cornelius I might have liked this story better. Of course, the newspaper clips starting each chapter, tying the apocalypse to the Bush administration, did help improve it! <br /> So, what is my verdict? Mieville lifts this collection, but, you would be better off bying Mieville's Perdido Street Station	2004-08-02

I prefer his children's books to his books for adults. This is not my favourite however. <br />Here we follow a nine year old girl that has just found out that she is a witch. The story is an old one. What I really like in the book is, of course, the wee free men - thrown out of Faerie land for being drunk and disorderly. Unlikely guardians for a little girl... Some of the minor characters are also very funny. Usually Prachett includes some clever description of curious phenomena in his books. Here we read about teachers following fairs, and giving lessons by the hour and receiving their salaries in groceries.	2004-08-02

The fight for Crete can be summarized as one long series of mistakes, by both sides, and it was the Greek civilians that were left to pay. The Germans plan was overambitious in the extreme, especially considering their limited transportation resources. The British were so extremely arrogant and clumsy that they turned victory into defeat. The surviving German paratroopers describe Crete as hell on Earth, and the author really manage to describe the nightmarish fighting. I like a lot that the author does not end his narrative with the British defeat. Because of the disastrous losses of the German paratroopers the isalnd lost its importance as a spring board to Egypt. However, the fighting continued as a fierce guerilla war, where neither side showed any mercy. Again, Beevor reminds us that war involves civilians, and even though the guns are silenced the wounds remain.	2004-07-31

This is a very recent book, so he can draw on some new research, opened archives, and interviews with participants. It is thoroughly researched, and sheds light on a surprisingly unknown phase of the second world war. <br />The tale is grim. He starts his narrative with the Soviet reinvading Poland. The Red army, intent on revenge, embarks on an orgy of destruction, pillage, murder, ethnic cleansing, and rape. The suffering of the civilians, especially the women, is one of the main themes of this book. And an important theme it is. The other main themes are how Stalin manipulated the western Allies, especially the US, and the total collapse of leadership in the Third Reich. The latter two themes are better known than the first, but it is always good to be reminded. Espcially now when so many of our leaders demand unquestioning faith from us. <br />I do not think any other history of the second world war has told the story of the ethnic cleansing of Poland and the eastern parts of Germany. Again we find out that history repeats itself. Rwanda, or the Balkans are nothing new. <br />The only drawback to the book, as I see it, is that it ends quite abruptly. I wonder what happened to the remnats of the German Ninth Army south of Berlin, or the pockets left in Koningsberg and Kurland, or to the international SS units defending the Reichstag. We only get hints at what happened to the returning Red army soldiers that had been 'contaminated' by exposure to the west. We are only told about what happened to marshall Zjukov, and he did not fare well. Otherwise an excellent book.	2004-07-30

Michael Jackson has sacrificed his liver so that others might know what beers are around! <br /> This book covers just about every major beer there is. The only complaint I have is that I cannot taste them all. It covers the history of beer, different types of beers, different beer making techniques (you will be amazed!), in short - it covers everything about beer! <br /> It has chapters on different beers, and different regions. Obviously, the chapters on Belgium, the UK, and Chech Republic are &quot;must reads&quot;. In a very nice and generous touch, he also tells us about US microbreweries, that produces surprisingly potable products. We now live in Alaska, end enjoy the some of the local produce from the Alaska and Silver Gulch breweries. The book is a little bit to big to bring on the travel, but I think he has also written a pocket guide.	2004-07-29

If All Quiet on the Western Front is about those who died, The Black Obelisk is about those who survived. Ludwig has returned home to Germany after the war. He is a stonemason. The company's big order is for a monument to honour the small towns war dead: the black obelisk. The mode of the book is a gentle melancholy. Ludwig survived the trenches, most of his friends died, part of him died with them. Wise beyond his years, he sees how the German's fail to rise up from defeat. Instead they fall to petty bickering, thus setting the stage for the rise of nazism. Instead of being a tribute to those who fell, the black obelisk becomes an ominous pointer to what lies ahead.	2004-07-14

Everywhere he turns corruption and stupidity are rife.<BR>He tries to go to colonial Africa as a doctor.<BR>Celine has a unique writing style; a sentence (the length of a breath) followed by three dots.

The promises of the fascist and nazi ideologies had misled millions and thrown the world into the ravages of the second world war. Stalinist Soviet Union was seen by many as a model state. Orwell knew far too well what was hidden beneath the promises of security, bread, and jobs for all.<br />1984 has become a household name as few other books; who does not know about Big Brother, or the Thought Police, nowadays? Even the title has become a catchphrase. I do not know any other cult-book that has been so thoroughly ripped apart by other famous authors; I remember Isaac Asimov thrashing it in the nineteen-eighties for instance. Many seem to believe that the society described by Orwell is an impossibility. The problem with the book is that Orwell thought his society would be a product of revolutions. When instead, in reality, the changes creep upon us. A new law here, a small change to statutes there.<br />The most obvious paralell to the book we have now is, of course, the war on terror. We have from top officials that it is going to go on for a long time, and that it is, essentially, unwinable. Readers of 1984 of course recognize the eternal war described in the book. Another paralell is how history changes; Winston Smith's job is to rewrite history so that it suits the present situation. Don't we recognize that? In the ninetenn-eighties, Iraq was our ally; now, Iraq has always been our enemy. Thought Police, I need not even mention this; the administration knows everything about us, and is prepared to use it.<br />We even have paralells to the Anti-Sex movement! The list can just go on.<br />Orwell's book was a cry for reason in the aftermath of a world gone mad. As with so many other cries for reason it disappears among the siren calls of our leaders.<br />I first read it over twenty years ago, in a different world; it was good then - it should be essential reading now!	2004-07-12

He was wounded sixteen times, he lost his brother. He experienced the trench war in all its hellish glory. That's the difference between Storm of Steel and other WWI memoires like Farewll to All That, Memoires of an Infantry Officer, No News from the Western Front, etc: Junger is not anti-war; he loved it! Do not expect some dreaming idealist though. Junger was a harsh realist. Nothing is to horrifying for him to tell (and believe me - there are a lot of horrifying detail!). He took part in the major combats on the western front, so we get a rare first hand glimpse of the war, The style is vivd, yet sober. He comes across as a Prussian gentleman, not cruel, but he does what he has to do to survive.<br />Junger later became one of the finest authors of the twentieth century. He is sadly unknown in the Anglo-Saxon world, in much due to his refusal to distance himself from Hitler (he did not embrace nazism though either). He lived an interesting life; he stopped doing LSD when he turned seventy, and he wrote a major treaty on the role of bugs in heraldry. More of his work deserves to be recognized.	2004-07-11

This book is also inspired by London (UK). The city of New Crobuzon is a mix of London and Gormenghast. It is not your standard Science Fiction book, Mieville has many sources of inspiration. He mixes elements of Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Magical Realism. His descriptions of the various races living in New Crobuzon are reminiscent of Jack Vance. <BR>So, the city, its inhabitants, and the main characters are very well developed, cmplex, and interesting. The plot is s little bit weak at times. The Dream-moths are well described, but they suspiciously eaily defeated. It is almost as if the fight against them is added to justify the book. What I really like in the book is the end. He does not fall in the trap of a &quot;living happily ever after end.&quot; No, the end leaves many question marks, many unresolved problems are still there, the main characters are left truly scarred and marked by their experiences, they need to live with the consequences of their actions. The end feels very realistic, life goes on, some conflicts are resolved, some persist, most characters, bad or good, survive. I think that the melancholy ending more than redeems the weak resolution of the plot. Real life is like that.	2004-07-10

Most of us know how important the spice trade was in initiating the age of exploration. But there exists surprisingly few books dealing with this aspect! Anyway, this is the book! My brother lent it to me. He said he could not put it down, and it turned out that neither could I! The book centres around a small island group called the Bandas. They were the world's only source of nutmeg - a spice worth more than its weight in gold. One ship in three was lost, usually about fifty percent of the crews perished during the journey. Still, if one ship every third year made it with a load of nutmeg its owners would make enourmous profits, and still have money to finance the next expedition. The trade, and its spin-offs, shaped world history - sometimes in unexpected ways.<BR>Competition was fierce between the English and Dutch. Vicious wars were fought, where the vanquished were treated without mercy. The whole story is told in this little book. There are plenty of characters, heroes like the sailor and soldier Courthope, villains like the Dutch governor Speult, and fools like the failed navigator Willoughby. There is more action than in a Verhooven movie, there is drama and great tragedy. in short, not too be missed.	2004-07-10

The author, a professional historian, has set out to write a fairer history of the Teutonic Knights. They are best known for their defeats, Lake Peipus and Tannenberg, were their adversaries have been cast as the \\"good guys\\". Here he proves that history is so much more complex. He follows their history from the foundation of the order until they become secular landwoners in the fifteenth century. The order did not exist in a political vacuum: northern Europe was a hotbed of intrigue where the knights were just one part. The author carefully explains the complex politics surrounding the unification of Poland and the christianization of Prussia and Lithauinia. We also find out that there were hardly any teutonic knights present at the famed battle of Lake Peipus, and that the defeat at Tannenberg was not the death knell of the order: it was the political infighting in the order afterwards! <BR>The order was not worse than any other of their contemporaries, oftentimes they were even more humane and civilized. As with all medieaval histories, we lack details. Something the reader just will have too live with.<BR>I have some complaints: The maps seem to exist without any connection to the text, and then, the narrative just stops. The author just explains that there exists no research on the order's later activities in the Balkans. The order still exists (there were involved in the opposition against Hitler), but that is not mentioned. This should be remedied in future editions.	2004-07-06

It is both an easy read and riveting. As with Hillary Clinton's Living History many reviewers seem to be  disappointed that there is not more space given to Whitewater or Monica Lewinsky. The Monica Lewinsky affair became big only because congress wanted too make it big! We should actually be happy that that is the biggest scandal of the Clinton Era. It just cannot be compared to Watergate, the Iran-Contras affair, or the lies about WMD's in Iraq. <BR>Both Living History and My Life are about people that have *lived*; they grow up in poor circumstances, and by virtue of their passion achieved greatness. Bill Clinton comes out as a man of feeling, gentleness, and compassion. He has his faults, of course, and he acknowledges them; but does anyone seriously expect him to crawl in the mud to beg forgiveness? Is he really the only US president to have made mistakes while in office? The problem Clinton has is that he allows people to see too much of the man. There also lies his greatness.

This is the only book I know of that deals exclusively with this odd theatre of operations. WWI in Africa did not have any impact on the war in Europe or on world history, but the stories are so fantastic that they deserve to be rmembered and retold. The first and last shots of WWI were actually fired in Africa, by unknown black soldiers. The author describes the colonial setting, and points out how unnecessary the war in Africa really was. All four major campaings are described in chronological order.<BR>The courage and loyality of the black soldiers fighting for the Germans were amazing. Most of the book is dedicated to the longest campaign, in German East Africa. Here, wastly outnumbered German troops fought with rifles and knob-kerries, time and time again outsmarting the British enemy. Idiotic racism led the British to first import Indian recruits to fight, rather than arming the black population. Oddly enough, it was the South African general, Smuts, who actually first starting using black troops for the British. Thus turning the tide.<BR>Von Lettow-Vorbeck must rank as one of the foremost generals of history. He is sadly unknown, even by military buffs, and deserves to be remembered.

That does not mean it is bad - quite the contrary, it is pretty good. I just got the feeling when I read it that after the well-deserved success of Neverwhere he felt he had to write something similar for the US market. Neverwhere dealing with London, UK.<br />It was kind of obvious to me that he is not as familiar with the mystic and magic of the US as he is of London.<br />The American Gods of the book are surprisingly poorly developed, and he chooses Odin as one of the main protagonists, which gives a bit of a tired feeling to me. On the other hand, the description of the restless wife and the protected American small-town are truly chilling and up there with his best.	2004-05-26

As such it is an important document.<BR>What Mr Poppel writes is so obviously heartfelt. He comes out as just about as nice a fellow as they come. As a paratrooper he literally existed between heaven and hell. He is lyrical in his descriptions of the actual parachuting. It is when he tries to describe his combat experience where his language falters. The man is not a writer. And the translation is atrocious.<BR>The fact is that the only major paratdrop by the Germans was Crete. Mr Poppel just states that the fighting was so horrible that he does not want to write about it. We must respect that decision. It does make it a weaker book though. It is an interesting war memoir. He sees action in Sicily, at the D-Day, and Holland. If you want to read about paratrooper warfare I would not recommend this book.	2004-05-08

Whatever the Clintons did, the Bush administration has done, ten times over. Clinton lied about Monica Lewinsky, but Bush has lied about his National Guard Service. Clinton was paid by foreign interests, the Bush clan has a remarkably cosy relationship with the bin Laden family, and the Saudi Royal family. Clinton pardoned major benefactors, Bush refuses to bring major benefactors to justice. Clinotn less than fifty thousand dollars in Whitewater, Bush lost fortunes in his failed oil companies, but was bailed out by friends. Clinton may have attacked Serbia to take off heat, Bush attacked Iraq for no apparent reason. On the other hand, Clinton did testify under oath to Ken Starr, Bush refused to testify under oath, and went with a babysitter. Clinton took questions from reporters, and got into trouble, Bush reads prepared statements, and gets hailed as a &quot;statesman&quot;.

That is a good way to start this review. If you think that the US media reports the truth, read this book. An alternative title would be: Exposing Slimy News-Reporters, Politicians, and the Media Moguls who own them.<BR>The most shocking part of the book is that most reporters do not even have to be ordered: they know what is expected of them, and censor themselves. <BR>Amy Goodman does deserve the title journalist, she does go out and ask the important questions, she goes to the hells created by US oil money in different parts of the world. Of course, the more wellknown reporters critisize her for doing just that.<BR>I have lived in Sweden, Mexico, and the UK before moving to the US. In all of these countries the government have their own tame reporters. But nowhere, do they have such a total control of the mediaflow as here! I am still shocked. Dan Rather acknowledges the problem - on British BBC! <BR>I have some issues with the book. Firstly, the style is a bit boring, more reminiscent of Noam Chomsky than of Michael Moore. The other thing is that, according to Amy Goodman, all news media is as bad. Only Democracy Now! is worth paying attention to. I agree that most of it is pretty bad, but she could be a bit more generous to some of her colleagues.	2004-05-03

Bob Woodward has previously been the darling of the Bush administration. Even though even his first book is a bit worrying. For instance when the president claims he does not have to explain his decisions to anyone. Here we clearly read that Bush immediately started planning for an attack on Iraq. He even directed money from the Afghanistan campaign. Would that not call for some serious questioning of the administration? Also I find the statemant that the president claims that he follows a \\"higher father\\" than his own frankly alarming. Is he not supposed to serve the American people, here on Earth?	2004-05-03

Grand palaces, and the people who lived in them? Carnival time in the Piazza of San Marco?  Perhaps life on the streets? What about life in a convent?  Too dull, you think? Then, you have not read Mary Laven's Virgins of Venice, a remarkable journey into the lives of the women who lived in the fifty or so convents that existed in Venice at the time. <BR>Nunneries were not only spiritual houses, but also end stations for noble women who could not be given away in marriage by their families. By using reports of investigations and trials, together with statements that came from the nuns themselves, Laven opens a world of suffocating oppression and enforced chastity, but also a world of determination from the nuns to lead a life as normal as possible. Contact with the outside world might have not been allowed, but the courts were full of incidents where both outsiders and nuns had breached the law. For instance, we learn that Zuana, a \\"gossip\\", kept hens for Madonna Suor Gabriela, and that in exchange, Suor Gabriela provided Zuana with wine and other commodities. <BR>This and many other stories  make this book impossible to put down, since we feel anger, sadness, despair and sympathy for those women whose lives were condemned from the moment they entered the convent. On the other hand, we can't help but to feel glad that the nuns did everything they could to fight back. From being petty to actually engaging in sexual acts, these nuns will forever be a remainder that no matter time and place, human beings will do the impossible to lead dignified lives. Bravo, Leven!	2004-04-07

As with most Asian guides to war and martial arts, the advice might appear basic, and even elementary, but to really understand, and to incorporate it into their life, it will take the reader years of training and study. Mr Tarver's background also gives him a special understanding of the original text, so the translation really feels right, and lot of power in it. <BR>Unfortunately, Mr Tarver loses a bit in credibility with his foreword. He appears naive. He blames &quot;wealthy liberals&quot; for their antimilitarism, while totally forgetting the greed that has driven many of the USA's wars. That mars an otherwise excellent achievemnt. Mr Tarver would do well to remember that you can be a honest warrior, but be in the service of an evil master. Just see what happened to the millions of Germans, Japanese, Italians, etc., that sacrificed their lives in WWII.	2004-04-05

For once, this book is not about her dress style, nor the tedious Monika Lewinsky affair, and whether she will divorce Bill Clinton or not. This book is about Hillary's remarkable journey, from the time before she was born to her days as a senator. Thanks to her excellent writing, we can vividly see the young girl blossom into a very determined young woman, always fighting for her beliefs. The most interesting part of the book, though, is when she talks about her days as a First Lady. It is fascinating to follow her all around the world. From China to Ireland, she takes the chance to talk about women's rights;  a daring move, but one that can make a big difference. Also, we learn how she coped with the turbulent world of politics, from the Whitewater scandal to Clinton's impeachment. Finally, her resolve to keep Chelsea out of the public eye, and to give her a life as normal as possible, tells us of a woman that is not only an excellent politician, but also a very good mother.<br />Granted, the book sometimes feels as though we were trying to be convinced of agreeing with a particular point of view. However, we must be remainded that this is the biography of someone who has been into politics basically all her life, so that can be excused. In a similar way, we can not expect someone from Hollywood to keep all the glamour out of their biographies. That is their lives.<br />This book is a very good read. I enjoyed it thouroughly, and hope you will do too.	2004-04-04

Many call Mr O'Neill a traitor because he questions the policies and decisions of the Bush cabinet. Perhaps they could take a break from their crusade and read this book. How can it be treasonous to question the commander in chief of a democracy? A democracy should strive for a high standard. Therefore it is important to have transparency, and an open debate. This book really provides that. I think what really galls the Bush supporters is that this book exposes the president's lack of brains, and how damaging that is to this country.

It is not particularly partisan; he goes back a long time and critizes all four previous administrations. Much of his critisism also is reserved for CIA and FBI, which are supposed to be apolitical organizations. No, the real issue here is that the present administration does not accept critisism in any form. Especially not over their supposed &quot;strong leadership&quot; in the &quot;war against terror&quot;. It is also obvious that Mr Clarke's critisism has hit a sore spot since the White House concentrate on destroying his credibility rather than conutering his arguments. The book also makes a point between the lines of the book that is actually quite important: Yes, the president did have regular briefings with the CIA. The president did not understand the danger. The president's lack of brains is actually a danger to this country.	2004-03-28

These guys have really worked hard. If nothing else, this book will teach the reader about what you can achieve with interdiciplinary research. They gather facts from archeology, medieval and ancient history, biblical studies, and masonic ritual. The conclusions they draw are probably be wrong, but still very interesting. They have asked the right questions and and used the right methods. <BR>For example: why did the early church destroy all written records about Jesus and the apostles outside of the gospels? What was the relation between Jesus and James? What does the Sinclar clan know? <BR>I think that the main mistake of the authors is that they had a theory they wanted to prove.

I was ill in bed and my wife bought Downsize this to cheer me up. I read it in less than a day. The book is hilarious, and Michael Moore has his facts right. His thesis throughout the book, and indeed throughout his early production, is that big corporations must stop accept government money and then fire most of their workforceto increase their already immense profits. He connects corporate greed to racism and corrupt politicians. His piece on congressman Robert Dornan is just superb! For me as a European this open corruption and greed in politicians in the USA is strange. Of course our politicians also lie and are corrupt, but they are a bit more discrete about it. And many of them are caught and forced to resign. We do not have this worship of Big Business. <BR>  At times the book becomes a bit rambling, but I can forgive that.<BR>  I hope more people will read and understand this book, and then go out and vote.	2004-02-15

Set in the height of Viking Age it tells us how Orm (Snake) is kidnapped by a band of marauding vikings. He then serves as a slave on a moorish ship, he is a mercenary among the muslims, he is marauder in England. He marries royally, settles, and goes on a treasure hunt for stolen gold in Russia. Bengtson uses the laconic language of the vikings to hilarious effects. The translator manages to keep it, which is great. The book is historically accurate with many historical events and persons interwoven in the narrative.	2003-11-08

The book is not only about the Percy's: it is about the period, but with them at the centre. They lived in a tumultous era and they were very much part of it. The author has done a splendid job with his source material and paints a fascinating history of the politics and warfare of the period. The tone of the book is slightly irreverent, which is good, since the protagonists are not always the nicest people.<BR>This book is very much about politics, not so much about culture or life in the middle ages. The only drawback is a lack of maps, which makes much of the activity in the book unclear.	2003-11-06

Adults will love this one too	Here Mr Ptatchett combines a funny and delightful story that children will love with some spry satire that will delight adults of all ages. The nomes' interpretation of human society is simply hilarious. The nomes do not understand how big the world is, and many of their assumptions will have the reader laughing aloud. On the other hand, their society and world-view is a mirror of our own. If the author wants to make us aware of the shortcmoings of our world-view, he succeeds magnificently.	2003-10-03

While set in Discworld, this book does not follow any of the established Discworld storylines. I would go so far as say his children's books (Bromeliad, Good Omens, etc.) are superior to anything Discworld. Even the names of the rats have kept me chuckling for several weeks.	2003-10-03

It covers the physical and chemical properties of sea ice and its role in the global climate. A large part of the book is given to the imoprtance of sea ice in marine biology. That is an area long overlooked by textbooks.	2003-10-02

I ususally do not go for thrillers, but I do make now make exceptions for Christopher Brookmyre! This book is highly satirical, funny, grisly, and thoughtprovoking. The heroes work in porn industry, and the crooks are biblethumpers and &quot;patriots&quot;.	2003-10-01

The contributors, including China Mieville, avoid most of the pitfalls of Lovecraft's successors. If anything, they fall in the smae traps as he did! Writing Cthulhu mythos stories is very difficult. While no story exactly fails, very few bring you to the brink of insanity either. Some stories, like \\"Details\\", \\"Meet me on the other side\\", and \\"Parameters and Principles\\" soars. At its worst this book helps bring back memories of those magic days of terror when you could read the real thing, and for that I really like it.	2003-09-28

This is the story about the Pazzi Conspiracy against the Medici dictatorship in renaissance Florence. The story is riveting, full of facts, and, on the whole, well told. The author gives a brief history of the families involved and of the florentine political system to give us a background to the conspiracy. The assault in the cathedral and the following bloodbath is told in clear and vivid detail. So far the book is great, just great. Then it is as if the author ran out of time! The Pazzi War and what happened to the Pazzi family members that did not die is described in an almost perfunctory way. The lives of Lorenzo's sons, daughters, and other surviving relatives are dealt with in just a few lines. Maybe the author expects the reader to get that information in more general histories of the Italian Rennaisance.	2003-09-18

It reads like a Greek tragedy - we know how it will end, we are just watching the events unfold towards their inevitable end: US &quot;civilisation&quot; advances like a glacier, slow but unremitting. I can only read it in small doses and then take a break.	2003-08-03

This book gives a clear, concise, and riveting explanation of the development of language and evolution of languages. Fischer manages to write a treatise that is both scholarly and popular at the same time. The only thing I miss is a chapter on popoualtion movement and languages that exist on the fringes - like the Tierra del Fuego languages.	2003-07-09

Reading this book is painful -  the republican slander machine does not stop at anything to keep the power in the US to themsleves. I was amazed to read that Clinton was accused of no less than twentyfive murders in connection with Whitewater - and that was only at the beginning of his presidency! The US must clear up its own act at the same time it demands democracy in other countries.<BR>The only issue I have with the book is the comparable lack of sources and references. The slander has to be met with proveable facts, not something that can be dismissed as propaganda.	2003-07-04
