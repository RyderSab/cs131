I love Stephanie Laurens' books.  She is among one of my favorite historical romance writers.  This book however greatly disappointed me.  The love scenes, while steamy, left me a little bored.  The two just never really seemed to fit.  Amelia was too naive and Luc's knowledge of sex was rather trivial. The words were there, but I just wasn't convinced of the passion and excitement of their lovemaking. When I find myself skimming through the love scenes something is missing. I also found myself bored with the page fillers.  This book dragged out so many boring incidents occurring in the characters lives I couldn't even finish the book.  I just skipped to the end.  Which by the way concluded so uneventfully boring it wouldn't have made a difference if I had read it first.	2002-12-02

Going through your teen years is very hard. We have so many questions about sexual situations, what is going on with our bodies, how to deal with emotions, why we feel the way we do... This book has taught me so much. Girls often want answers to questions that may be too embarrassing to ask their mom about, even friends. It's so nice to be able to get the answers to those questions from a book. I would highly recommend this book for teenage girls. It's very easy to understand and it gives you a relief to know your not the only person with these problems and emotions.	2002-12-02

Lindsey loves to bring old characters from previous novels into more recent novels.  I think this is an excuse she uses not to have to develop new characters.  This book took the cake on revisting previous characters.  In fact the book was more re-introducing you to them then it was a new story.  <br />Her conversations were too frequent and boring.  I did not like the Brittany or Dalen.  They had no chemistry as far as I am concerned.  I could not even finish this one, what a waste of cash.	2002-09-26

What ever attracted them to one another is beyond me.  Neither displayed much passionate emotion.  What a disappointment after having read other Jo Beverly novels.  I haven't read the Malloren's series, but I am almost afraid to.

After having read the &quot;Duke and I&quot;,  I searched for some more Julia Quinn novels.  I found &quot;Splendid&quot;. There was nothing splendid about it. (Please pardon the cliche!)  I think it is very sad when  an author attempts to write a story with silly cliches simply to fill the  pages.  Its also a sad testimony to romance readers when an author thinks  we will be happy with just any old story-line.  Please we need some better  story-lines and authentic characters.  I am so upset with this purchase, I  also have &quot;Dancing at Midnight&quot; left to read.

I skipped over half of it.  The words did not flow well in this story.  The characters did not speak as true persons would speak.  Their lines were written as though  they were to be read and not spoken.<br />I did not feel any chemistry between  Louisa and Will.  She was forever nasty to him.  He was always too  understanding of her nastiness.  Honestly, I could not understand what he  saw in her.  After he realized she was not the woman of her letters, it was  not clear why he even bothered with her.  Will was a nice man, but he  inspired no passion.  I felt he was too weak and not hero material.  Their  love scenes were silly, the descriptions were so uncreative and not in the  least passion inspiring enough, &quot;His warm lips tasting her until her  knees went weak and her entire body shook with longing.&quot;  How silly,  the lust just is not there for me.<br />I think the author used this novel to  preach her opinions on angels and God.  Really it was all so silly.  Will  saw more angels than the Profits I think.  <br />One more critisism, Pip,  Louisa's little 9 year old, spoke far too wisely for a child of her age.   She was far to mature and experienced for one so young.  In one scene she  says &quot;John Henry has a prodidious imagination.&quot;  Really how many  adults would say such a thing?<br />I could go on and on with critism, but I  won't.  Suffice it to say I skipped through to the end because I just kept  getting too embarrased for the author.  The book was so amateur.  How she  ever became a best selling author scares me.  I need to be more careful on  choosing books simple for this reason.	2000-05-12

The female character in the story had spunk, and the male character admired it. I subtracted a star because I like to get to know the characters.  I like to live inside their heads and feel what they  are feeling and know what they are thinking.  I found this a little hard to  do because the characters were a little too one dimensional.  The story was  too predictable, and a little too unbelievable.  This all sounds bad, so  why the four stars, because truly I loved the book.

I give Ms. Coffman 2 stars instead of one because first of all she took the time to try to write a love story and secondly she had the basis of a good story.  The problem for me is the way she writes.  Her characters conversations are so silly.  They don't build the characters personalities.   As a matter of fact I almost feel embarrassed for them.  The whole  character developments left me lacking.  I also think it is so completely  stupid to assume that we are going to fall for a character such as Lizzie,  when she is nothing but a smart mouthed brat.  Tavis, well now he was just  plain and simple a jerk.  He never inspired in me anything but comtempt.   If Lizzie was portrayed to be so smart, why could she not see Tavis for  what he truly was?  Yuk!  What a very dull story.  I only finished it  (truly by skipping over half of it) because I hate to start a book and not  finish it.	2000-02-25

The heroine of the story was too far fetched for me. She wore her Indian heritage like a badge on her sleeve yet she was not raised among the Indians, and her mother died when she was ten.  Where did all her deep seeded Indian instincts come  from?  What was implied by her great archery skills and her martial arts  style of fighting?  Are all girls of Indian heritage good at such, simply  because they are Indian? If that were not the implication where did she  learn such skills, let alone have time to perfect them?  Surely her mother,  who was living among civilized folk did not teach them to her little  girl?  Ms Putney tried to paint her as deep and heroine-like, but it just  did not work for me.  She was too false and uninteresting. Lord Robert  was  just as unbelievable as she was.  Several times his small stature was  eluded to.  Yet he was able to (with the help of his &quot;warrior  princess&quot; of course) fend off a trained fighter, far greater in size  then he.  How silly!  Why not just make Lord Robert a big man in the first  place?  Isn't that what we truly want in our heros?  He was really a nice  sort of chap, if not a little scattered though.  Imagine a girl trips over  you in a field and lo you just decide you want to travel, by foot, two  hundred miles with her.  Don't bother to pack anything for the journey, or  try to talk the girl into a much safer journey, via a coach or horse, just  head off.  Too unbelievable for me. He had lived the life of a spy, what he  could possibly found interesting about Maxie eluded me. I don't really know  what inspired such love and instant loyalty between them. The side story  between Lord Robert's brother and Maxie's Aunt was so uninspiring as well.   The novel would have done just as well, or not, without it.  Another silly  love at first site story with no real depth. Anyway I don't think I'll be  buying another Mary Jo Putney novel. Maybe I'll borrow one fromthe library  so I do not waste money again.  Sorry to the fans of this novel, my  intention was not to offend, merely to give another point of view.	2000-01-26

I gave this book two stars, because Ms. Reding did take the time to think up a story and write it down.  I don't want to sound ungrateful for the effort.  I truly had to force myself to finish it though.  I am one of  those readers who feels a certain commitment to a novel once I've begun it.   I feel this novel was so very basic in its expressivness as well as its  descriptivness.  There was so much chit chat among the characters, I felt  bored with them.  This droll chit chat carried through even into the  characters' thoughts.  I think this in turn severely damaged the chemistry  of Dante and Gillian.  Frankly there was none.  Gillian was portrayed as,  before her time, highly curious and bright.  Honestly, could not her  dialogue have reflected this.  Dante was toted as a Rakehell Earl.  How  very silly, his past truly was not well established enough for you to even  begin to have this image of him. Sorry Ms. Reding this the second novel of  yours that I have read and it is most likely my last.	2000-01-05

She really knows how to steam it up.  The chemistry between these main characters is right on. My only complaint  is that the main female character appeared a little too simple minded.  In  my opinion a man as intellegent as this story's hero, would most likely  need someone a little more mentally stimulating.  Other wise loved, loved,  loved it.	1999-12-24

I loved the story, but I could not get past the picture Ms. Dodd kept painting of Jane.  She was not very likeable.  First of all she was described as large and unattractive.  Her personality was that of a 50 year  old woman, when indeed she was only 27.  I found nothing to attract Ransom  to her other than her fasination with sculpting his body.  His loyalty to  her troubled me.  He informed on her, yet he married her.  What a way to  begin a marriage.  I don't know maybe its just me, but these two did not  have good chemistry between them.<br />I like the fantasy of a beautiful  heroin and a handsome hero.  If I want reality I'll stick with life.  I  like to lose my self in the world of my novels.  This book left me with a  difficult time picturing the characters.	1999-11-30

This is one of those books I felt obligated to finish simply because I started it.  I skipped over  every other paragraph and still stayed with the plot.  I kept getting hung  up though on the puny attempts at making this an interesting story.  There  was no depth to the story and the characters were very poorly built.  How  could Burke have been so devoted to Alys when he merely kissed her a few  times.  Alys was ever stubborn when Burke attempted to tell her his story.   Yet she believed her family that had abused her.  Silly, silly, she could  stand up to Burke, but not the aunt who berated and beat her.  This was no  Cinderella story, just a sad attempt at some off beat fantasy.  Sorry Ms.  Delacroix, but you'll have to do better than this to keep your readers  interest.	1999-11-10

It took many interesting turns, but it continually left me with a big but..... Sophia bested Tobin in the forest in disguise and he never knew it was her.  The story never again mentioned  the encounter.  I wanted him to know that it was Sophia, and maybe see a  little respect given her.  The story trailed off too many times and never  quite came full circle.  Ms. Barnett's descriptions and comparisons of  things left me with the feeling that she just couldn't think of a better  way to put it.  Example: &quot;it was as if a butterfly were right there  inside of her heart.&quot;  How silly.  I also found so many typos and poor  sentences I lost count. Example: &quot;Since they had come to Camrose,  since the day they had wed, she found.....&quot;, too much since not enough  sense.  The characters were likeable, but you just couldn't quite  completely respect their plights.  Sophia started out as a spoiled brat,  with an attitude of &quot;Oh poor me, I live in a palace with the Queen of  England treating me as her very own, but I do not have my own  parents.&quot;  Somehow I just could not feel too sorry for her.  Tobin  came from a womanizing father.  Not the best of circumstances, but still it  could have been worse, he could have been beaten or abandoned.  He grew up  very wealthy and was fostered by a very loving man.  I think the story  tried to make you feel sorry for the characters and it just didn't happen  for me.  Sorry Ms. Barnett nothing against you.  I have enjoyed other  stories of yours in the past.  Maybe after just having read Christina  Dodd's &quot;Outrageous&quot; I got a little spoiled.	1999-10-11

I feel I waisted my money.  Shame on Kathleen E. Woodiwiss for slapping this together.  I am not a writer, but I feel sure I could have thrown this book  together.  Cerynise makes me ill.  She is so one dimensional.  The author  tried too hard to convince us that all were awed by her beauty.  Enough  with the idiots that could not function normally in her company.  Beau was  an unbelievable hero for this novel.  He was to candy apple perfect.  His  anger was non-believable as well.  There was no chemistry between the main  characters in their love scenes.  Beau was supposed to come from a very  uprights decent set of parents.  What was he doing hanging out with all  those harlots.  I was also dissappointed with the accents.
