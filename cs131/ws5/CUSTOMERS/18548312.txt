Abby longs for a regular life, which would include living with both of her parents (and not in a detective agency!) and also not having visions other people don't have. But Dorcas keeps reminding her daughter how her special gift, including an amazingly good and timely \\"guess,\\" saved the day with a previous case.    Abby wishes she never had inherited her sixth sense from her mind-reading ancestors. She tries to deny her \\"magic nation thing,\\" which is what she named her special powers after misunderstanding when someone told her that what she was experiencing was \\"just her imagination.\\"    Dorcas takes on the case of kidnapped six-year-old Miranda Moorehead. The mother suspects her ex-husband of taking their daughter. Abby is especially interested in the case because Paige, Abby's best friend, believes she saw the victim shopping before she was kidnapped. One day, Abby picks up a locket belonging to the little girl. She begins to experience her \\"magic nation thing\\" and has visions of the girl having fun with a man at Disneyland. Abby, however, does not want to admit, even to herself, that she has these weird powers. Therefore, she can't just come out and tell her mother what she's seen. On the other hand, if she doesn't tell her, maybe Dorcas won't figure out where Miranda is. Finally, Abby thinks of a way to set the right wheels in motion.    Abby's powers lead her into one adventure after another in this exciting book. Unfortunately, they also threaten her friendship with Paige. When someone close to the two girls vanishes, can she muster up her sometimes-unpredictable visions to save him?    The characters in THE MAGIC NATION THING seem like real people. They include a frequently irritating mother, a beautiful adult friend who hates being considered gorgeous, and a best friend whose spunkiness sometimes lands the two girls in trouble. In addition, Abby's special powers are described so thoroughly and convincingly that the reader nearly experiences them! This book is an excellent read, with a fast-paced plot and a subtle but thought-provoking theme about self-acceptance.       --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon [...]	2005-09-23

While the first book was truly Hillary's tale, this one is from the viewpoint of Neeve. Kate and Neeve squabble over the redecorating of the shabby area, both wanting to plan the new look. As the girls scout the attic searching for usable finds for their new lair, Neeve discovers a shocking old wedding photograph of her father --- but the bride is not her mother. Completely flabbergasted, Neeve hides the photo and doesn't mention it to anyone.    Sloan, the meanest girl on Gull Island, invites the cousins to a sleepover. When Sloan insults two of the cousins, Neeve talks the others into accepting the invitation with the plan of getting even somehow. But Gee gets wind of their revenge plan and squashes it.    The girls begin cleaning and painting the Dorm, planning to amaze Gee with a big unveiling of the freshly decorated guesthouse. Meanwhile, Gee delights the cousins by giving them driving lessons \\"just in case of an emergency.\\"    Neeve discovers that Sloan has something that Neeve desires with her whole heart. She trades her case of exotic makeup without telling her cousins what she's trading for, which leaves them confused and worried.    The mystery surrounding the puzzling wedding photo deepens when Sloan cryptically mentions the girl in the pictures, adding that her mother says how sad it all ended, and that everyone on Gull Island was upset. Neeve is more anxious than ever. What is the story? Did her father do something wrong? Was he actually married before? Why wouldn't he tell her? Could he have other children?    An intriguing mystery, a fabulously cozy setting, and the friendship of \\"cousins forever\\" add up to another fresh, fun read in this series. If the conflicts are rather easily solved (as in the averted revenge scenario) and relationships/settings/mealstend to be just a bit too perfect, it all adds to the very high \\"escape reading\\" enjoyment factor.       --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon [...]	2005-09-23

It begins when 11-year-old Sam Carnabie is invited to spend his Easter holidays with an old friend of his parents, Professor Ampersand. Professor Ampersand, an inventor, has dozens of interesting contraptions, from a motorcycle built for four to an oven-boiler that heats water at the same time that it cooks food. Professor Ampersand's great niece and nephew, Ben and Zara, are delighted to show Sam all the innovative delights their house has to offer. <br /> <br />No sooner have they finished dinner on the very first night of Sam's visit, however, than an urgent message arrives, quickly followed by five of Professor Ampersand's former colleagues. Together with another scientist, Professor Murdo, they were once responsible for trying to found a top-level university at Nordberg, a tiny island in the far north. However, when Professor Murdo's unethical experiments came to light, he decided to flee, taking his six colleagues with him and abandoning them in a huge field of snow and ice. Only a secret known to one of them, a secret they've all promised never to reveal, got them home safely. When Professor Murdo's private soldiers show up a few hours later and kidnap all six professors, Sam, Ben and Zara are left with only a confusing clue to the secret and their unwavering determination as they set off to find the professors and unmask Murdo's frightening scheme. <br /> <br />The three children's surprising and exciting adventures are at the heart of the rest of the book as they wend their way north to the island of Nordberg. Alternating with scenes from the life of another girl, Marcia, who ends up in Professor Murdo's clutches for entirely different reasons, the story of Ben, Zara and Sam's escapades are edge-of-your-seat exciting, but always plausible in the context of the story.  Fardell's world of surprising inventions means that the reader is constantly making new discoveries right along with the kids in the story. Although based in fact and science rather than fantasy, Fardell's world building is on a par with the Harry Potter books --- in fact, THE SEVEN PROFESSORS OF THE FAR NORTH reminded me more of the spirit of Harry Potter than any of the numerous copycat fantasy books spawned since the young wizard's success. <br /> <br />Each of the three children brings his or her own skills to the adventure --- Sam's preparedness, Ben's map-reading abilities, Zara's boldness --- and each of them comes up with innovative ideas when they're most needed, usually just in the nick of time. As the book approaches its exciting conclusion, it's easy to believe that their adventures have helped Sam, Ben and Zara develop the courage they need to confront Professor Murdo. <br /> <br />From start to finish, John Fardell's THE SEVEN PROFESSORS OF THE FAR NORTH is a delight to read. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Paula Jolin	2005-09-23

Molly herself rescued Lucy from a long hypnotic spell. However, Lucy is not happy; she is full of regret for the years she has missed.    Petula, Molly's pug dog, is also a hypnotist. Like Molly, Petula has the ability to stop time. When a suspicious turbaned stranger appears working as a gardener, Petula knows she must protect Molly. But when Molly goes outside, there's a loud BOOM and both the gardener and Petula vanish.    Molly confides in her father, her friend Rocky, and her older hippie pal Forest. They can't keep Molly from being hypnotized by the pug-napper, who takes her back in time to nineteenth-century India where she actually sees herself three years younger.    Molly and Petula meet the kidnapper's master, Waqt, a time-traveling giant who is angry because he wanted Molly Moon at a younger age --- before she became a hypnotist --- so he could foil her previous adventure in which she inadvertently ruined his plans to make his patsy president of the United States. Waqt's goal is to mine more of the time travel crystals enabling him to travel to the beginning of time, bathe in the light, and become young again. Waqt blackmails Molly (by threatening to turn Petula into pug curry) into time traveling to do his bidding.    I delighted in the quirky characters, including the hippie dude Forest and the English-muddling Waqt, and loved the completely original plot in which Molly hopes to rescue several younger Molly Moons. The reader also gleans some fascinating facts on India's sights, history and culture.    Although I was slightly befuddled by the time shifts and differing points of view of the different-aged Mollys and Petulas, the action and wry humor kept me reading on to see if and how Molly saved the day. MOLLY MOON'S HYPNOTIC TIME TRAVEL ADVENTURE is technically a stand-alone novel, but I recommendreading the previous books in the series first for the background story --- and for pure pleasure!       --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (...)	2005-09-23

Thor's goat boy, Thialfi, accidentally allowed the dwarf into Thor's house. Thor's hammer is the most powerful weapon the gods have against the fierce giants, enemies of the gods. Even though Thialfi doesn't tell anyone it's his fault that the hammer is missing, he gets enrolled in the plan to bring it home. <br /> <br />Mischief maker Loki is sent to bargain with the giant. Thrym will return Thor's hammer if he can marry the beautiful goddess with the hefty temper, Freya. <br /> <br />Freya refuses with great gusto and breaking of dishes. The alternate plan is to convince the giants that Freya has come to the wedding when it's really a god disguised as Freya. When the hammer is returned at the wedding, the plot is to bring an end to the thieving giants. But the giants have an imposter of their own. <br /> <br />Dressing a god, his goat boy, and Loki as women proves to be a very funny undertaking as the goddesses can't decide what to use for false bosoms --- apples or two sleeping rabbits? <br /> <br />Thialfi finds a dress difficult to move around in as he works behind the scenes to aid his master's recovery of the hammer. A mysterious pair tells him how to find the hammer in return for his secrecy. He can't tell anyone who helped him, which adds another layer to Thialfi's already guilty conscience. <br /> <br />Bruce Coville's passion for Norse mythology translates well into a fun chapter book for young and old. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Joy Held	2005-09-23

Her older brother Eddie is fighting the war in Europe and Meggie misses him terribly. To make matters worse, her new house looks like a long box with few windows and no grass or trees in the yard. Her home in Rockaway had been near the sea; she used to hear the call of seagulls and breathe in the fresh, salty air.

Then the reader is advised to close the book and stop reading immediately. The hero, 12-year-old Percy Jackson, is far from your ordinary, everyday high school student. In fact, he is about to be kicked out of his third high school.    Try as he may, Percy just cannot behave himself and settle down to study. His mother understands, for reasons unbeknownst to Percy. After beating up a bully who is attacking his best friend, Grover, strange things start happening to Percy.    In fact, after only one or two chapters, Percy's math teacher turns into a horrible, terrifying monster who tries to kill Percy. Then a gigantic Minotour (yes, a Minotour from Greek mythology) chases Percy until Percy tears off one of his horns and he dissolves into sand. Then, a few seconds later, Percy's own mother disappears before his very eyes in a cloud of golden haze.    What is going on? Grover leads Percy into Camp Half-Blood, which, as it turns out, is inhabited by creatures straight out of ancient Greek mythology --- only all this is happening right now, in the 21st century! And Camp Half-Blood is where students like Percy, who discover they are really demigods, are trained in the ways of the Greek gods (shades of Hogwarts School).    Because of Percy's outstanding clever behavior at the camp/school, he is awarded a quest. Someone has stolen the god Zeus's most precious symbol of power: his lightning bolt. Percy's mission, should he decide to accept it, is to find the thief and return the powerful lightning bolt to Zeus before a war breaks out between Olympus and the Underworld.    As you might imagine, horrible things happen to Percy and his two friends, with monsters and disaster at every turn. (Good thing this is all fiction!).

Rey	Books	5	42	42	N	N	The true-life tale of Curious George's creators	Over the years, millions have followed along as Curious George learned the alphabet, went to the hospital, received a medal, and flew a kite. His most dramatic adventure, though, took place the year before his 1941 debut when his creators, Hans and Margret Rey, embarked on a journey that not only saved their lives but, in a sense, George's as well.<br /><br />On June 12, 1940, as the German army marched through France, the Reys left Paris, traveling on bicycles that Hans made using spare parts. For three days they pedaled, on the first leg of what was to become a months-long journey that took them to five countries. Their final destination was New York City, where they made their new home.<br /><br />On a gray, rainy day the Reys left Paris with little more than the clothes on their backs, but Hans carried precious cargo in the basket strapped to his bike --- a manuscript for their children's book featuring a cheeky monkey named Fifi (later re-named George).<br /><br />As Louise Borden recounts, Hans and Margret were both raised Jewish in Hamburg, Germany, and their families were acquainted. In 1935, nine years after Hans had left Hamburg to settle in Rio de Janeiro, Margret too departed Germany. After working as a photographer in London, she made her way to Rio to look up Hans Rey, with whom she then began collaborating professionally and personally.<br /><br />After the two artists were married in August of 1935, they returned to Europe and settled in Paris. It was here that they began writing and illustrating children's books, but five years after they arrived in the French capital they were forced to undertake their journey. Paris was becoming an increasingly dangerous place --- especially so for German-born Jews --- and hours after they left, the city fell to enemy forces.<br /><br />Borden writes in the book's Introduction, &quot;For many years, I was intrigued by the story of Margret and H. A. Rey's flight from Paris.... Others in the children's book field had mentioned this escape from the Nazi invasion, but no one seemed to know the details of those harrowing days. The story felt incomplete. I wanted to know more. I wanted real images. I was curious, just like the Reys' famous little monkey, George.&quot;<br /><br />The result of Borden's curiosity is this vibrant biography, told in picture book format. She does a fine job balancing serious aspects, including Hitler's rise to power and the changing political climate, with the whimsical, such as the fact that Hans and Margret owned two pet monkeys while living in Brazil and later shared their Paris apartment with two turtles.<br /><br />THE JOURNEY THAT SAVED CURIOUS GEORGE is enhanced by Allan Drummond's colorful illustrations, along with the Reys' artwork, excerpts from Hans' pocket diaries, photos, correspondence, and mementos from Hans and Margret's long journey. Readers young and old will delight in this true-life tale of Curious George's creators.<br /><br />  --- Reviewed by Shannon McKenna	2005-09-23

Best case scenario: she'll get to act with her older brother's friend Seth and convince him that she's not a little girl anymore. <br /> <br />But Bella is not prepared for all the things that could go wrong, such as her best friend Rani getting mad at her because trying out for the play means she can't do brain bowl like they planned, or the fact that her role of Titania includes flying across the stage in a harness. Bella is so afraid of heights that she hasn't done her laundry for a week because she doesn't want to climb a step-ladder and get the detergent down from the top shelf. How is she ever going to get into a harness and fly high above the audience in the play? <br /> <br />When Bella receives a mysterious message advising her to tell a friend her secret fear, it takes her a while but she finally figures it out. But can she reach out to Rani, who's still mad at her, and ask for help conquering her fear of heights? Or is Bella doomed to be a friendless member of the audience? <br /> <br />Once again, the Star Sisterz sets just the right tone for a series book. The characters, particularly Bella and Rani, are believable and the conflicts are difficulties that every young teen faces. Bella takes realistic steps to solve her problem, and it's likely that the decisions she makes could inspire readers to face and conquer their own fears. <br /> <br />Bella lives in a three-dimensional world that includes siblings, parents, teachers and friends. Her father in particular is a vivid and intriguing character, and Bella's relationship with himis heartwarming. One of the things I like best about the Star Sisterz series is its recognition that everyone has problems, and that even minor problems can loom large and insurmountable if you don't know how to solve them. In BRIGHT LIGHTS FOR BELLA, author Lana Perez takes care to show that problems can be broken down into smaller pieces and solved one step at a time. This is an important lesson for preteens and teens to learn --- and something many adults could use a refresher course on. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Paula Jolin	2005-09-23

They are going to Camp Happy Sunshine Good Times, which is actually a camp for young Anybodies. Fern can't wait to learn more about her magical skills. <br /> <br />On the day they are about to leave, however, strange things start to happen. First, Fern accidentally shakes Diet Fizzy Lime Drink bottles out of a book. After investigating, Fern realizes that the bottles have notes inside that say things like, \\"Help us! Trust no one, especially grown-ups. We need you!\\" and \\"Fern, we know you have the powers to defeat him. Please find us!\\" Then, Fern witnesses a strange scene in her grandmother's basement. When Fern and Howard arrive at camp, it is anything but what they expected. The counselors are mean, there's a vicious mole attacking people, and Fern continues to shake out pleas for help from Diet Fizzy Lime bottles. Could these be notes from the lost people called the Nobodies? <br /> <br />N.E. Bode (or is it Julianna Baggot, \\"the trusted friend\\" noted on the dust jacket?) delivers yet another fun adventure with THE NOBODIES. Similar to THE ANYBODIES, the author continues to write in first person to tell the tale and mixes in quirky anecdotes. This technique is reminiscent of Lemony Snicket's writing style. Here, Bode is still complaining about her evil writing teacher who she claims is insanely jealous and is out to get her. <br /> <br />Again, like the first book, THE NOBODIES is filled with elements of mystery that make it a page-turner from start to finish. Bode's writing style is quirky, funny and enjoyable all around. Readers will love learning more about the art of being an Anybody, as Fern learns more about her skills. The NOBODIES is so full of life that, as it comes to an end, this reader found it abrupt and almost too soon. <br /> <br />Is this the last we'll see of Fern, and the Anybodies and Nobodies? I doubt it! <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Kristi Olson	2005-08-17

She finds herself living in the Shady Grove Trailer Park in Alligator Grove, Florida. Her best friend, Alexandra, has red hair and freckles; the only problem is that she isn't a real person --- she's an imaginary friend. Sometimes that's the best friend a girl can have.

Welcome to the world of THE ANYBODIES! First, we meet eleven-year-old Fern Drudger who is trapped in a rather dull life with her tragically boring parents. Mr. and Mrs. Drudger are both accountants at a firm called Beige and Beige. They enjoy dull things only: toasters, sponges, and refrigerator magnets. <br /> <br />Fern, on the other hand, is different from her parents. She loves books and writing in her journal. Fern is anything but dull and has had some unusual things happen to her. As a toddler, she filled her room with crickets when she was looking at a picture book. And once, when she was learning to read, she caught snow that turned into words. She made the words into a curious sentence: \\"Things aren't always what they seem, are they?\\" And more recently, the strange events have increased. Fern observes a nun turn into a lamppost, and then during her swimming class, she sees a bat become a pile of marbles! Fern can't tell her dull parents about these strange sights. They already think she has an \\"overactive dysfunction\\" --- an imagination! <br /> <br />One day, Fern's boring world is interrupted by a shocking surprise. Mary Curtain, the hospital nurse who delivered Fern, arrives in tears. She tells the Drudgers that there's been a horrible mistake. Fern is not a Drudger after all! She was switched at birth with a boy named Howard. Howard is with the nurse as well as a man, Fern's father, who calls himself the Bone. A quick decision is made --- Fern will go with the Bone for the summer and Howard will stay with the Drudgers. <br /> <br />As soon as Fern leaves with the Bone, her adventure begins. You see, the Bone is not like the Drudgers in the least. When Fern gets in the car with the Bone and the nurse, she realizes that her summer will be anything but boring. She learns that the Bone and her mother are Anybodies --- people who can turn into practicallyanybody. Anybodies can also use hypnosis and deep concentration (mixed with a third \\"something else\\") to help other people become better versions of themselves. Fern also is told that her mother (who sadly died during childbirth) was a natural Anybody and learned it all from a special book called THE ART OF BEING AN ANYBODY. The Bone, on the other hand, was not as skilled, which Fern soon witnesses from a slew of his hypnotizing mishaps. <br /> <br />The Bone also tells Fern about the Miser, an Anybody who has gone bad, and the Great Realdo, the most powerful and heroic Anybody of all. <br /> <br />The Bone hopes that Fern has inherited some of her mother's Anybody powers. He needs her help for an important mission --- to find her mother's special book, THE ART OF BEING AN ANYBODY, before the Miser can get his hands on it and use it for evil doings. <br /> <br />THE ANYBODIES is a fun-filled adventure that mixes elements of many of today's popular books. Similar to Lemony Snicket, author N.E. Bode uses the first person to tell the tale and mixes it in with quirky anecdotes (here, mostly about her evil writing teacher). Also, the first person allows for many references to other children's books of past and present. For example, the author compares Fern's dilemma to that of several other characters in dangerous situations: \\"What if Stuart Little had been a girl? He would have arrested her parents for allowing a young girl to set off alone in a motorcar, that's what! What if Harry Potter had been a girl, spirited away by a giant of a man with a magical umbrella? Would you have put up with Violet Baudelaire being haunted, on her lonesome, by that man with the singular eyebrow?\\" <br /> <br />In addition, the elements of mystery and adventure make THE ANYBODIES a page-turner. N.E. Bode (or is it Julianna Baggot, \\"the trusted friend\\" noted on the dust jacket?) has created a quirky and funny read perfect for the summer. As we follow Fern and her many adventures, we realizethat \\"Things aren't always what they seem, are they?\\" <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Kristi Olson	2005-08-17

Gisella's family had a dozen chickens, each named for a different month. Flame, a wily fox, stole April and May. Armed with a crossbow Gisella entered the forest to kill the fox. She encountered an owl-person who insisted there must be a trial to determine whether or not Flame was really guilty. It was a most unusual trial, with a jury composed only of birds and a white spider as judge. Flame was found innocent. Gisella stared too long into Flame's eyes, and as Great Aunt Tanteh had warned, Gisella and Flame switched bodies. <br /> <br />Thus begins a most unusual and magical tale. All the animals in this book can speak and understand humans. There is a war going on between the black army and the purple army. So much destruction is occurring that the magical, invisible world is rapidly disappearing. Even the ordinary, everyday world is in shambles. Gisella's family is being held captive in the Crystal Palace and are threatened with death. The emperor is trying to find out Great-Aunt Tanteh's secret: how she gets December to lay golden eggs. Gisella the fox and her animal friends create a bold and risky plan to try to save the family. Magic intertwines with reality often in this book, which has a surprise ending. <br /> <br />Mordicai Gerstein writes from the animals' point of view --- as he imagines it. This is in stark contrast to how humans think, he often suggests. A young child will be enchanted by the fairy tale quality of the book, while older children will enjoy the many twists and turns of the story. Adults will appreciate the timeless truths; for example, that war is always a battle for power and that, when confronted with a major decision, it is often difficult to know which path to choose.

Rowling has kept her promise --- that each of Harry Potter's years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry will be darker and more difficult than the one before. This sixth installment is the darkest and most complex of the books yet. But just in case you have any doubt, Harry is proving well up to the tasks at hand --- and his magical world seems more vivid and real than ever. <br /> <br />Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts is off to a rocky if exciting start. The Wizarding world is at war after the violent showdown at the end of Book Five that saw the death, injury or arrest of several key characters --- and the clear return of evil Lord Voldemort/ He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Mysterious murders and magically triggered disasters continue, and there has been a mass breakout from Azkaban, the wizard community's prison. Even Muggles are starting to notice, including the Prime Minister. Families of students heading back to school on the Hogwarts Express are on high alert, but reassured that new security measures are in place along with a tough new Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Harry has received an unusual summer visit from Hogwarts headmaster Professor Dumbledore during which the trusted mentor explains just how different Harry's upcoming school year will be. Among other things, it will include private study sessions with Dumbledore where the elder wizard will shed more light on the prophecy about Harry laid out in Book Five and help Harry discover --- through memories viewed via Dumbledore's magical Pensieve ---Lord Voldemort's heritage and just what makes him tick, including the dark magic that has rendered him seemingly immortal. <br /> <br />Now 16, Harry and his pals Ron and Hermione have received their O.W.L. exam results and must buckle down in their studies to focus on the more specialized N.E.W.T. level. As in years past, there is a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher; this time a most surprising candidate fills the post. All this means piles of homework and ever-more-challenging classroom projects. It's a good thing that Harry has discovered a used potions textbook filled with helpful --- and sometimes dangerous --- spells and hints scribbled in the margins. The book says it was once property of the Half-Blood Prince, a mystery that Harry and company are determined to solve. And sneering bully Draco Malfoy continues to be an annoyance and more as he sorts out where his own loyalties lie and tries to master more complicated magic. <br /> <br />The little free time Harry has is spent captaining the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and readers who love the high-flying action of the game won't be disappointed. Social lives are not completely put on hold either, as Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny Weasley are among those contemplating their fluttery romantic feelings (sometimes for each other). And Fred and George Weasley's joke shop is doing booming business, which accounts for some of the good bits of humor throughout. <br /> <br />As spring arrives and the end of the school year nears, Harry accompanies Dumbledore on a secret and perilous mission that at its heart contains a key to Voldemort's undoing. The two brave wizards could not know, however, that their actions would help trigger a high stakes battle back at Hogwarts pitting Death Eaters (Voldemort's henchmen) and yes, vicious traitors to Hogwarts, against the good guys. When the blood and the Dark Mark in the sky are cleared, not everyone survives. <br /> <br />When it comes to the clever weaving of plot threads all the way back to the sorcerer's stone and Chamber of Secrets, Rowling is at the top of her game. She keeps a broad roster of familiar faces in the fore and reminds us of past characters and events and how they play perfectly into her ultimate plan for Harry. She also writes in a slightly more sophisticated style than the earlier books, with a richer emotional tone that matches Harry's developing maturity. <br /> <br />Away from all the action of his latest story, Harry is indeed growing into a young man. He is still grieving over losses experienced during his fifth year but knows he must move on. He's learning to be more comfortable in his own skin, even if it means accepting being \\"The Chosen One\\" singled out by Voldemort and a subject of constant scrutiny and curiosity to classmates, teachers and the public at large. It's the kind of stuff that makes a guy really appreciate who his true friends are, and Harry has some gems in Ron and Hermione. <br /> <br />By the end of HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, Harry emerges as a calmer, more psychologically deep teenager who seems to have lived lifetimes far beyond his 16 years. He is now fully confident about his life's calling --- to defeat Voldemort at any cost --- and has developed a steely resolve, bolstered by great emotional pain, to carry it out. Whatever the wait for a final battle-to-the-death in Book Seven, it will be too long. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Shannon Maughan	2005-08-11

Many writers have continued the stories, and now Sherwood Smith can be added proudly to the list. This is a fun little story about two sisters, Em and Dori, who are direct descendants of the original Dorothy Gale. Em is the practical one and concerned with much more grown-up things than Dori. Dori believes in everything to do with Oz and has a special snow globe that is supposed to have come from Dorothy. The girls are feeling sad and upset because their parents have separated. Then one day, in the middle of a quarrel, a tornado sweeps through. The first thing you know, Em and Dori have arrived at Oz! <br /> <br />In Oz they find themselves in the middle of a group of beautiful unicorns who actually hold beauty contests and enjoy having themselves groomed. While this is all very interesting, the sisters become aware that they must make their way to the Emerald City and have princess Ozma send them back home. After they help a strange boy named Rik escape from the unicorns, he agrees to help get them to Ozma. Unknown to Em and Dori, Rik is a prince and is actually a gnome, which all goes into making this an even wilder adventure. <br /> <br />When the magic snow globe shows the sisters that the Emerald City seems to be under some kind of spell, they are even more cautious as they approach. And indeed, Bastinda --- a young witch descended directly from the evil Wicked Witch of the West --- has succeeded in putting Ozma and the Emerald City under her spell. She eventually wants all of Oz to be under her control and will stop at nothing. Those two little girls and the weird boy with them most definitely do not frighten her. She, however, does underestimate their cleverness as they learn about and eventually switch green wands on Bastinda. A couple of little girls from Kansas are just as clever as their Aunt Dorothy! <br /> <br />Em and Dori have happily encountered some of the more famous of the Oz folk, such as Scraps, The Scrapwork Girl, the Scarecrow and the beautiful (but conceited) Glass Cat. Together they will help bring about the downfall of Bastinda and restore Princess Ozma as leader of the Emerald City. There is a lot to be accomplished if they want Ozma to help them back home! And once they return home, will their parents get back together? <br /> <br />Sherwood Smith has done a fine job reviving some of the older beloved characters and updating the Oz stories.

It all depends on where your heart is.\\" <br /> <br />There are certain characters in literature who leave a lasting effect on all who come in contact with them. This is especially the case in young adult books where the protagonists are still under the spell of adolescence and therefore subject to temptation, change, and various outside influences they don't quite understand. Unlike their fully developed adult counterparts, these fledgling youths are still learning the ways of the world and have not yet become jaded or afraid to try, to feel, or to be erratically irrational and exuberant in their actions and outlook on life. It is precisely this combination of vulnerability and strength that makes them so endearingly lovable, admirable, and timeless. <br /> <br />In Sue Stauffacher's extraordinary new novel, HARRY SUE, the 11-year-old heroine who shares the title's name is a feisty firecracker of a girl with tough skin and an outspoken attitude. She is fiercely independent and so confident that her path is the right one that she will challenge anyone who disagrees with her --- including the school principal, her teachers, her Granny, and even her best friend Homer before the accident. With Harry Sue Clotkin, however, there is more --- much more --- than meets the eye. <br /> <br />When Harry Sue was younger, her deadbeat father threw her out of their apartment window in order to get back at her mother, who was cooking crack on the kitchen table. When the cops came to carry the two away to prison, they were shocked to find the little girl, who had miraculously escaped the seven-story fall with only a few bruised ribs. As both parents were incapacitated, she was immediately sent to live with her grandmother, a decrepit old woman who \\"ran\\" a daycare center by keeping the children drugged with cold medicine so as to prevent any misbehaving. Not soon after, her best friend Homer hit his head on a rock while diving off a pier and became paralyzed from the neck down. At such a young age, Harry Sue had already experienced her fair share of tragedy. <br /> <br />So, how else to wind up imprisoned like her parents or Homer than to try to get sent to the proverbial slammer herself? What better way to \\"do her own time\\" like the ones she loved than to rack up detentions at school, play tricks on her classmates, teach Granny's charges prison-talk, and keep herself as detached as possible from life's possibilities. Fortunately, with Harry Sue, nothing is quite that simple or that easy. <br /> <br />From saving a classmate's life at school, to acting as a surrogate daytime mother to an army of \\"crumb snatchers,\\" to being the rock of hope and humor for Homer in his slow-going recovery, Harry Sue inadvertently sabotages all hopes of being \\"locked down\\" and instead emerges as a role model for all who know her. By living from her heart and embracing the world around her, she learns that \\"doing her own time\\" might not be as bad --- or as isolating --- as she thinks. <br /> <br />With this warm and deeply insightful novel, Sue Stauffacher again has proven her prowess as a writer and a champion of what's possible in the face of tragedy. Her allusion to L. Frank Baum's THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ will delight readers, who will want to read the book twice for hidden parallels, and the \\"Joint Jive Glossary\\" at the beginning will provide a welcome authenticity to the book's context. In short, \\"time, my friend, is something you have too much of, and you'll learn that a story well told --- even if it's full of joint jive you can't fully comprehend --- is worth more than all the personals you collected on the outs. Especially if it lifts you out of your skin.\\" <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Alexis Burling	2005-08-11

This 42-foot-high wall not only encircles the four towns of Elyon, but also the roads that connect the towns. The purpose of the wall? To keep out the dangers lurking in the hills and forests. But to 12-year-old Alexa Daley, the wall is an inconvenient barricade standing between her and the forbidden adventure and mysterious excitement offered on the outside. <br /> <br />As she and her father, one of the town mayors, travel to his annual meeting, Alexa decides that this is the year she'll find a way to escape. She already knows the town inside out (well, inside anyway) from years of exploring. But if only she can luck out with a hint, or discover a clue to get started, she's sure that she'll find a way outside the wall. Then Alexa stumbles upon a key that opens the door to an adventure of a lifetime --- and sheds light on a conspiracy that threatens the lives of everyone in Elyon. <br /> <br />THE DARK HILLS DIVIDE, Patrick Carman's first novel, is a rare and valuable gem. Filled with mysterious clues, secret passageways, hidden maps, sneaks and spies, and a magic stone that allows Alexa to speak with the wild animals, this story will thrill anyone willing to travel through the pages of Elyon. Carman has a wonderful sense of humor that spices up his characters and gives a lighthearted feel to a sometimes dangerous mission. His amazing descriptive talents will have readers shuddering with fear as Alexa squeezes through a tiny tunnel, moaning with sympathy for her aching blisters and breathless with awe as she dives for the glowing stone. <br /> <br />An added bonus to this enchanting tale is the promise of continuing Alexa's adventures in a sequel, BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THORNS, which is due out in August. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Chris Shanley-Dillman, author	2005-08-11

Here are some other interesting facts you should know about Ingrid: She and her math teacher don't get along. She has a boyfriend for the first time. She prayed for --- and got --- the lead in Alice in Wonderland. And, oh yes, one more little thing: Ingrid has to solve a murder after leaving some incriminating evidence at the scene of the crime.    For better and for worse, Ingrid's mother sells real estate and is out all the time. Ingrid's brother Ty plays football, and her father, who works late a lot, is constantly trying to build up his muscles by making himself exercise. Ingrid hates his boss, so it stands to reason that she hates Ingrid too.    As if all this weren't enough, things get curiouser and curiouser. Ingrid's grandfather owns a large tract of land in a very desirable area, a fact that does not escape Ingrid's mother, father and his dreaded boss. They try to get Grandpa to sell them his land so they can build condos, but Grandpa is as stubborn --- and as smart --- as they come. He and Ingrid devise a clever scheme to keep anyone from ever buying and building on his property.    And of course there's the little matter of the murder. Ingrid became inadvertently involved when she got lost, ended up at the house of a very weird lady, and left her red soccer shoes there. Then the poor woman was murdered. If the police find Ingrid's shoes, then her mother will know that she wandered off and ended up in a scary neighborhood. Ingrid would be grounded for sure. So she has to get her shoes back from the murder scene.    When she returns to the dark, empty house to look for her prized possession, someone else stealthily sneaks in, scaring Ingrid to death. She hides, terrified, under the murdered woman's bed, and sees the sneakers of the killer as he walks around the room. They're smeared with green paint and she can recognize them easily if she ever sees them again.    Meanwhile, as they say, the plot thickens. Two homeless men are arrested for the crime. Ingrid figures out that they aren't the murderers. And the police chief soon discovers that someone has removed the red shoes. As Ingrid tries to determine who owns the green-smudged sneakers, she finds herself deeper and deeper down into \\"the rabbit hole.\\"    Everything is happening at once. The police chief wants to talk to Ingrid, while his son would like to make a date. The rehearsals for Alice in Wonderland start to go bad when the director falls and gets hurt, and a new director takes charge.

Frita Wilson decides that she needs to liberate her best friend, Gabriel King, from his fears.    A disastrous end-of-fourth grade Moving Up Day ceremony where Gabe is bullied by some classmates is the catalyst for Frita's brilliant plan. She decides that she and Gabe need to list all of their fears and spend their summer methodically trying to overcome each one of them. Gabe's list of fears is long and includes spiders, loose cows, Frita's basement, and most of all, fifth grade. Frita's list is shorter, but since she is the only black child attending a white school, she may have the hardest fears to overcome.    Ms. Going seamlessly weaves in a subplot about the upcoming Presidential election of Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer from Georgia. When Gabe tells stories of Mr. Carter's peacemaking and non-tolerance for prejudice to Frita's family, it helps cement their friendship even further.

Gnat has a reputation as a troublemaker, but secretly she just wants to learn about the world --- she loves reading, and desperately wants to go to school. <br /> <br />Mary's Cove is surrounded by misty, creepy swamplands, presided over by the evil Foggy Bottom Swamp Queen, Zelda, and her army of bogie monsters known as Swamp Knights. Seven years earlier, Zelda, who often takes the form of a panther, kidnapped the handsome youth Goodlow Pryce. Since then, Goodlow's sweetheart, Penelope Drinkwater, has pined over her lost love. <br /> <br />Gnat wants to like Penelope, but when a talking cat (soon named Eatmore Beans) delivers an enchanted locket with a cryptic message from Goodlow, Gnat intercepts it and finds herself head over heels in love with Goodlow. Soon Gnat and her three friends are on a quest to rescue Goodlow so that Gnat can become a town hero and find true love. <br /> <br />GNAT STOKES AND THE FOGGY BOTTOM SWAMP QUEEN is written from Gnat's perspective, in a folksy, down-home tone that lends ambience to this Appalachian tale.

Resigning herself to separation from her beloved hills, father and friends, Hattie attempts to find the solution to the mystery, as well as forge a new life for herself in difficult surroundings. <br /> <br />HATTIE ON HER WAY has all the ingredients for a compelling children's novel: an intriguing mystery, a misunderstanding between major characters that needs to be worked out, an opportunity for the main protagonist to grow as she sorts through her own problems and misassumptions. Unfortunately, the book didn't live up to its promise for me. <br /> <br />The main problem I had was with the narrator herself. Hattie's strong voice represents her equally strong personality. First person narration is always a two-edged sword: it gives the reader an intimate, up-close look at the story, but if the narrator isn't engaging, he or she can be very off-putting. This was my experience with HATTIE ON HER WAY. Other readers might find Hattie's rough hill ways and her plainspokenness refreshing, but her personality didn't work well for me. <br /> <br />On the other hand, the plot never fails to be interesting, incorporating a number of surprises as Hattie manages to solve the mystery herself. The book also includes a very moving subplot in which Hattie finds out more about her dead mother's past, and comes to understand her mom with a new, more mature vision. <br /><br />Readers of the first book might enjoy HATTIE ON HER WAY more than I did. Although I never warmed up to the narrator, the book does offer some thoughtful ideas about growing up and taking responsibility for your role in relationships, as well as a compelling mystery. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Paula Jolin	2005-06-24

In LESSONS, it's now fall; Rachel prepares to start fifth grade at the regional school, and baby Matthew is firmly part of the family. But Rachel's father seems deeply sad every time he looks at the baby, and he often can't stand even to hold him. <br /> <br />When Rachel finally asks her mother the cause of her father's sadness, Rachel's mother reveals a family secret. Many years before, Rachel's parents had a baby boy, Roger Gene, who died before he could be baptized. According to their Lutheran minister, Roger Gene could not have gone to heaven and could not have a proper Christian burial. Although Rachel's mother, raised Methodist, believes that Roger is in heaven, Rachel's father, a confirmed Lutheran, is tortured by thoughts that his deceased child is not in heaven; now this new baby boy brings those thoughts to mind constantly. Is there some way that Rachel's father can come to terms with his faith and find a way to love his baby son? <br /> <br />Bonnie Geisert is best known for her detailed nonfiction picture books, illustrated by her husband Art Geisert, documenting everyday life in different types of small towns. This fact-based approach is also evident in LESSONS, particularly since, as Geisert mentions in her afterword, the novel is based heavily on Geisert's own family history. Although Geisert is not a particularly graceful writer, her novel is filled with details about mid-twentieth-century farm, family, and rural school life that may be of interest to readers who enjoy learning about history. There are also many Lutheran theological fine points that may go over most readers' heads. Rachel, though, is a sympathetic character, genuinely concerned about her father's happiness, and the novel's ending is hopeful and family-centered. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl	2005-06-24

When they join a traveling fair, Annie becomes the center of attention, leading to Joe feeling left out and alone. These feelings prompt him to flee the fair and join a gang of street kids, leaving Annie behind. Guilt and shame follow him through subsequent adventures on the streets of Manchester, but he never forgets Annie and soon begins a new quest to try to find her. <br /> <br />Set amid a poverty and inhumanity that is truly appalling, THE WHISPERING ROAD nonetheless contains a spirit of kindness and hope. While Joe, the first person narrator, can be thoughtless and immature, his love for his sister and determination to find her makes him a character the reader will care about. Most of the other characters in the book come across as three-dimensional as well, even those who appear only briefly. <br /> <br />THE WHISPERING ROAD takes elements from historical fiction and fantasy to offer a unique reading experience. The historical details are accurate and interesting, evoking Dickens and other 19th-century authors as Michael describes the living conditions of the poor in sometimes frightening detail. However, the narrative also contains fantasy elements that lift it into the realm of the unusual: Annie talks to the dead and the children meet up with some other-than-human characters. This combination works well in the story, integrated with a fast-paced plot and a lot of dangers. <br /> <br />The book may have too much real life for younger readers, including death, disease and abandonment. Still, it's leavened with enough hope that it should be a satisfactory read for both younger and older teens. The ending, in particular, will encourage readers to think, bothabout the fate of the characters and the ways in which the world has changed in the last century.

It is Choosing Day, when each ward is apprenticed to a Craftmaster to learn a trade. Will wants to be accepted in Battleschool where the fief's knights are trained. Instead, he is chosen to become a Ranger's apprentice. Will is deeply disappointed, and a little scared. Rangers are shadowy characters, believed to practice magic that makes them invisible to ordinary people. His master, Halt, is cranky and makes Will do all the housework. <br /> <br />What Will doesn't know is that Rangers are protectors of the kingdom. They are highly trained spies and agile fighters who warn the country of coming danger. With the exiled Morgarath, Lord of the Mountains of Rain and Night, gathering his forces for an attack, Will's growing skills will be tested, immersing him in unexpected adventures. <br /> <br />Many elements of THE RANGER'S APPRENTICE: THE RUINS OF GORLAN are typical fantasy fare. Readers know before they open the book that they will encounter a feudal world threatened by an evil warlord. There is a typical cast of fantasy characters, with the threat of malign magical creatures. The plot centers on a battle between good and evil. It is possible that the reason why fantasy remains a popular genre is because there is a certain comfort in its repetitiveness. <br /> <br />This book shines most in its details. In elevating a ranger to a main character, the author allows for lots of adventure, but also a chance to explore an element that has been pursued less frequently within the fantasy genre. John Flanagan also has some interesting twists in the relationships between some of the characters. He fleshes out the relationship between Will and his fellow ward Horace, who begin the book as enemies, but end as friends. Flanagan also takes on the topic of bullying. He doesn't draw a parallel between the schoolyard battles and the greater forces that threaten the kingdom, but young readers are likely to identify with theexperiences of the young characters. <br /> <br />THE RANGER'S APPRENTICE: THE RUINS OF GORLAN is not likely to convert non-fantasy readers to the genre, but it will be appreciated by those readers who already enjoy fantasy and are looking for a new world to explore.

Since she and her three cousins --- Phoebe, Neeve, and Kate --- have all turned twelve, they get to stay an entire summer without their parents, at Grandmother Gee's big house on Gull Island. <br /> <br /> Grandmother Gee's house is absolutely perfect for a summer with Hillary's beloved cousins --- huge and rambling, with hidden nooks and many cozy corners. It comes complete with a view of the nearby ocean and a swimming pool. The cousins, all so different and yet all so very Callahan, are ecstatic to be spending the summer together. As Gee says, \\"Cousins last forever.\\" <br /> <br /> Hillary longs to prove to her father, and to herself, that she's a true Callahan. She decides that the best way would be to revive a game her father and uncles once played against another island family, the Bickets, in which each family competed to plant their flag on a certain small gull-shaped island. Hillary plans to have the Callahan flag firmly planted on the proper island by the time her dad arrives for a family reunion. But she can't do it alone. Can she talk her less adventurous cousins into joining her? <br /> <br /> When Hillary suggests the flag-planting scheme, only Neeve is eager to begin the adventure. Neeve manages to sway Kate and Phoebe by suggesting that the game will cheer Hillary up, and help her have a happy summer in spite of her parents' divorce. <br /> <br /> Even with all the cousins (more or less) willing, there are other obstacles to Hillary's goal. The girls must find and equip a boat, and learn to sail it. They need to find the right gull-shaped island. Unfortunately, unfriendly Sloan Bicket learns of their scheme and seems snottily determined to uphold the Bicket honor. Will Hillary attain her goal before her father arrives? If she does, will it result in an all-out feud between the two families? <br /> <br /> This first book in the Callahan Cousins series is irresistibly cozy. It manages to have an old-fashioned flavor while remaining totally \\"today.\\" While the reader learns a bit about Ireland, ocean tides, islands, boats, and other subjects, the teaching is understated enough to be interesting without overpowering the story. Although the setting and some of the characters (such as Gee, the grandmother) may seem a bit too good to be true to some, others will adore their utter perfection. <br /> <br /> THE CALLAHAN COUSINS: SUMMER BEGINS is refreshingly sweet-tempered; it decidedly is not gossipy, sarcastic or edgy. Readers, myself included, will eagerly anticipate the next book in the series. <br /> <br /> --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (terryms2001@yahoo.com	2005-06-08

Kids are better at death than grown-ups give them credit for....\\" <br /> <br /> From the 2004 PEN/Phyllis Naylor Working Writer Fellowship winner and author of LOVE, RUBY LAVENDER --- an ALA Notable Children's Book, a Children's Book Sense 76 Pick, a Parent's Guide Children's Media Award Winner, and a New York Public Library Book for Reading and Sharing --- comes a touching tearjerker for young readers about coming to terms with death and remembering to appreciate life in all its capacities. With a slicing candor that is at times hard to stomach yet crucial to the book's overall resonance, Deborah Wiles has penned a second novel that will hit readers through the heart. <br /> <br /> Ten-year-old Comfort Snowberger's family owns and runs the town funeral home in Snapfinger, Mississippi. In her short life, Comfort has attended 247 funerals and has taken part in everything from helping to bake the casseroles for the guests to writing her own version of the newspaper's obituary column, \\"Life Notices by Comfort Snowberger: Explorer, Recipe Tester, and Funeral Reporter.\\" Along with her brother Tidings, her parents, her best friend Declaration, Great-uncle Edisto, Great-great-aunt Florentine, and her dog Dismay, Comfort does her utmost to keep everyone's spirits up under what are oftentimes the dourest of circumstances. <br /> <br /> Life runs smoothly in the Snowberger household until the day when Great-uncle Edisto has a stroke and dies. A short while later, Great-great-aunt Florentine takes a tumble in the garden and dies as well, peacefully sprawled out amidst the lavender. With so much funeral preparation and mourning to do, the last thing Comfort expects is for Declaration to ignore her in order to befriend two \\"cooler\\" girls at school. To make matters worse, her eight-year-old cousin, Peach, is acting like a baby and receiving all the attention! At the end of it all, Comfort is left feeling confused, hurt, and worst of all, lonely. <br /> <br /> Then, on the day of Great-great-aunt Florentine's funeral, when a massive storm rages and floodwaters sweep Dismay under the current and threaten to take Comfort and Peach's lives as well, the Snowbergers' somewhat nonchalant and comfortable relationship with death is shaken to its core. But, through straightforward discussions, patience and plenty of hugs to go around, they manage to slowly rebuild their lives by reaffirming their love for one another, their community, and their lives. <br /> <br /> Deborah Wiles's second novel is a quiet yet immensely arresting read for young adults. From its honest and direct approach to death, to the author's cunning choice of characters' names (Comfort, Declaration, Tidings, Dismay), to the fact that the ending certainly made this grown reviewer cry, EACH LITTLE BIRD THAT SINGS is perfect for fostering parent-child conversations about what it means not only to deal with losing someone you love, but also to be thankful for what you have, while you have it --- \\"grief and fear and hope and love somehow woven together, somehow connected. All the messy glory.\\" <br /> <br /> --- Reviewed by Alexis Burling <br />	2005-06-08

Jenna, the baby girl, becomes the Heaps' treasured daughter, but of course Silas and Sarah never forget Septimus. However, Silas nearly forgets that soon after he found baby Jenna, the cranky ExtraOrdinary Wizard, Marcia Overstrand, commanded him to tell no one he found her and to claim she was born into the family. <br /> <br /> Curiously, six months later Sarah hears that the queen was killed on the day her daughter was born. Rumor has it that Marcia rescued the princess. Sarah realizes that Jenna must be the princess. <br /> <br /> A spy discovers the young princess living at the Heaps and notifies the evil Supreme Custodian. He orders Jenna and all the Heaps killed. Luckily, his order is overheard by the ExtraOrdinary Wizard ghost, Alther Mella, who notifies Marcia Overstrand. Marcia takes Jenna, and suggests the Heaps hide in the forest where they will be safe. <br /> <br /> In short order, Marcia revives a frozen, nearly dead sentry boy named Boy 412. Jenna is overcome at the magnificence of the Wizard Tower and of Marcia's apartment in which the fireplace lights itself, the sofa situates itself in front of the fire, and warm socks materialize on cold feet. Silas and his son Nicko appear in order to give Jenna her birthday gift --- a pet rock that walks around and then naps cozily on Jenna's palm. <br /> <br /> The Assassin arrives at Marcia's apartment prompting Jenna, Marcia, Nicko, Silas, Maxie the dog, and the silent sentry boy to escape down the rubbish chute.

Much like the \\"Little House\\" books, THE BIRCHBARK HOUSE documented the traditions, celebrations, joys, and sorrows of an ordinary family. In Erdrich's novel, though, this family is part of an Ojibwe community rather than a group of white pioneers. <br /> <br /> Readers who came to know Omakayas, the heroine of THE BIRCHBARK HOUSE, have been waiting a long time to find out what happens next to this vibrant, likeable character and her family. The good news is that the sequel, THE GAME OF SILENCE, is finally here, and it was definitely worth waiting for. <br /> <br /> THE GAME OF SILENCE opens with a dramatic scene that sets the theme of much of the rest of the novel. Omakayas's small community is shocked by the arrival of strangers, other native peoples who have been displaced by chimookomanag, or white people. Frightened, half-starved and angry, the survivors become part of Omakayas's life, and their harrowing stories instill fear and anxiety into everyone's hearts. Could they be the next to lose their homes? Erdrich writes, \\"They would all fear to lose something huge, something so important that they never even knew that they had it in the first place. Who questions the earth, the ground beneath your feet? They had always accepted it --- always here, always solid. That something was home.\\" <br /> <br /> Omakayas worries about her home, too. She loves her family and the land where they live. She thinks, \\"If they ever had to leave, ...her heart might fall right out of her body to lie forever on the ground it loved.\\" As the year wears on, though, Omakayas is troubled more and more by dreams, almost visions, that seem to ask her to do something she's not yet ready for. Can she ignore what seems to be her gift? Before the end of the novel, she must face her fears in order to lead her family on to the next chapter of their lives. Omakayas is still the sensitive, lively, sometimes impulsive girl of THE BIRCHBARK HOUSE, but in this novel she grows up quickly. <br /> <br /> Although there are some big themes explored in THE GAME OF SILENCE, Erdrich still enriches her novel with the small details of everyday life that also made THE BIRCHBARK HOUSE so compelling. Over the course of a year, the patterns of Omakayas's life play out --- harvesting rice, smoking fish, telling stories, sledding on the snow, preparing for a wedding. These ordinary tasks are described in loving detail, enabling readers to gain a fuller picture of a time, a place, and a way of life. In addition, Erdrich offers a comprehensive glossary of Ojibwe terms and dozens of lovely pencil illustrations of the characters and their natural surroundings. <br /> <br /> What emerges is a portrait of a family --- and a culture --- on the brink of change. Let's hope we don't have to wait as long again to discover what that change will mean for Omakayas and her people. <br /> <br /> --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl <br />	2005-06-08

The mean little thing attacks Clemency with a stinging wand, forcing her over a cliff! Clemency might have fallen to her death if not for the life-saving roots of a nearby tree. But despite this close call, she is still in danger as the cruel fairy dives in for another attack. <br /> <br /> Drawing on her knowledge of the world of fairies, Clemency remembers that all she has to do in order to defeat the fairy is to denounce her belief.

He takes his faithful horse, Gabe, and heads for the West, land of the cowboys and Indians. It is there that he stumbles onto his new occupation and his nickname, Scrib. All those lectures about grammar from his mother come in handy when he becomes a letter writer for lovestruck cowboys and hostile Indians. <br /> <br />SCRIB is a story of a young man's experiences in the Wild West. The story, told in Scrib's own words, is lively and full of cowboy speak. Scrib has regular customers on his route and the reader meets all of them in this funny tale. What would a Wild West story be without danger and outlaws? Scrib solves the mystery of who has been robbing and killing ranchers all over his territory. This leads to plenty of action and suspense in the exciting climax. <br /> <br />I have a word of caution for the youngest readers. Cowboy language is peppered with bad words, although they are disguised with dots and dashes in the text. Even so, the voice of Scrib rings true. He speaks just like I imagined a cowboy would. I found myself talking like him long after I put the book down. <br /> <br />David Ives is also the author of MONSIEUR EEK, a story about a chimpanzee who is mistaken for a Frenchman. Ives went to Northwestern University and Yale School of Drama, and is best known for writing plays.

Most of the tension in the story revolves around the fact that Phil Finch, Peter's father, wants to date Livvie's mother. Peter and Livvie are good friends, but that doesn't count for much. Phil Finch is just plain weird, especially to a sixth-grade girl. He has crooked teeth, glues doll heads to the hood of his car, and has plastic decorations all over his front lawn. To make matters worse, he is hiding a terrible secret in his upstairs office. <br /> <br />Young readers will identify with the likable protagonist in this story. Livvie is confronted with real life issues of family and friendship. She learns that good luck is sometimes disguised as bad luck and that you can make your own luck in life. <br /> <br />THE CHAIN LETTER is Julie Schumacher's second novel for young readers.

When she asks how he was able to get the cold hearth lit so quickly, Leifer is vague and doesn't mention the vellum. <br /> <br />Enna is concerned about the sudden change in Leifer's mood and his indifference to their country of Bayern. When she tries to reason with him, Leifer becomes angry and they argue. Later that day, Leifer is again moody and unpredictable. When a heated debate almost proves fatal, Enna wonders what has become of the brother she once knew. <br /> <br />Soon Enna is reunited with her dear friend Isi, who married Geric, the prince of Bayern. Isi appoints Enna as her personal maiden, and they oversee the first major battle between Bayern and the kingdom of Tira. The fighting is harsh and bloody, with many lives lost, including that of the king of Bayern. When Leifer use his firepower on the enemy, the results are both frightening and breathtaking. Geric and Isi are now the ruling monarchs of Bayern, and Enna must say good-bye to her brother, who has died in the blaze. <br /> <br />Wanting to know exactly what happened to Leifer, Enna reads the vellum.

After all, the hero of the story, a young boy named Martin and his younger sister Jeannie are invited into the house of Barry Welton, a teenager they had just met after Martin had an unfortunate incident on the ball field that left him sad and disillusioned. <br /> <br />Can you imagine something like this being written in 2004, without sinister consequences? But a brief look indicated that this engaging story was written in 1954; it has been re-released by Little, Brown to celebrate the Golden Anniversary of the first offering of the prolific children's author Matt Christopher. <br /> <br />Indeed, reading THE LUCKY BASEBALL BAT is like stepping into a time warp, similar to viewing an episode of \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" or \\"Father Knows Best.\\" If only we could enjoy those simpler days again, when parents didn't have to worry (as much) about the intentions of strangers; when kids were grateful for small pleasures, such as succeeding in sports, without the distractions of television, computers, or other impediments to childhood. Martin's depiction, as well as the exposition of his family's relationship, is so foreign to modern sensibilities (unfortunately so) that Christopher could well have written his debut book in 1854. <br /> <br />Even the simple illustrations by Robert Henneberger denote an era long gone, before manga became the dominant expression artwork directed at young people. <br /> <br />Martin is the new kid in town, anxious to prove himself on the diamond. First impressions get him off to a poor start until Barry, a star athlete, gives him one of his old bats, which transforms the youngster into a hitting machine and helps change the minds of his formerly ambivalent teammates. <br /> <br />When the bat is broken during a game, Martin, with the help of some other newfound friends, learns that the power lies within him, not in a piece of wood. The lesson seems obvious in today's know-it-all world, but it still has a certain charm, at least to people of a certain age. Indeed, parents (and grandparents) might find this tale more enjoyable than their offspring. <br /> <br />Progress has offered kids and their families vast opportunities. Still, there's something to be said for the simple pleasures of a less hectic period. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Ron Kaplan (ronk23@aol.com)	2004-12-10

Matt Christopher: The #1 Sportswriter for Kids	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A son's affectionate and honest tribute to his famous father	Perhaps more than any other children's author, the prolific Matt Christopher reminds kids that in order to succeed in life, you must work hard and never give up. After entertaining youngsters for more than forty years with dozens of stories that contain this important message, his son Dale now tells his story. <br /> <br />The son of Italian immigrants, Matt Christopher was born in 1917. A good student, and a better athlete, he had hopes of becoming a major league ballplayer. He actually played in the minors for a time before realizing he didn't quite have what it took to make it all the way. Perhaps it was this experience that made him sympathetic to the yearnings of his readers and more realistic in their eyes. <br /> <br />His family could not afford to send him to college, so Christopher held many jobs as a young adult. But in the back of his mind, he always wanted to be a writer. As any member of that profession can tell you, it's a very difficult career, one that can be quite harsh in bursting dreams of aspiring authors. Christopher suffered many drawbacks in the form of rejections for his stories, but it never stopped him. His persistence was rewarded fifty years ago when his manuscript for THE LUCKY BASEBALL BAT was accepted by Little, Brown and the book was published in 1954. <br /> <br />Following this debut, Christopher kept coming up with new ideas, updating his stories with the changing times to incorporate other sports as they became more popular, such as soccer and skateboarding, and using girls as his main characters rather than in supporting roles. (He also published mysteries for young readers, although his publisher insisted he do so under a pen name.) <br /> <br />Christopher also wrote several sports biographies for kids, including such inspirational favorites as Lance Armstrong, Wayne Gretzky, Mia Hamm, Tony Hawk, Michael Jordan, Mark McGuire and Tiger Woods, among others. <br /> <br />Dale Christopher's examination of his father --- who passedaway in 1997 --- is affectionate, proud and honest. Things weren't always easy for the Christopher family, but they stuck together and were favored with a degree of fame within the children's literary community. At the conclusion of this tribute, the son cites the father's philosophy, which was the focal point in many of his stories: <br /> <br />\\"Don't ever stop doing what you believe. Don't ever let anyone stop you from realizing your dream.\\" <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Ron Kaplan (ronk23@aol.com)	2004-12-10

Just when they think they are safe, though, the Baudelaires are in for their most harrowing adventures yet. <br /> <br />The Queequeg submarine is captained by Widdershins, a jovial but impatient fellow who is searching underwater for the mysterious sugar bowl that holds important secrets. It seems that the sugar bowl has vanished into a treacherous underwater cave, so small that only the children (including Widdershins's daughter Fiona) can enter it. Little do they know, though, that the cave is filled with poisonous mushroom spores, one of which is inhaled by one of the Baudelaires. Soon, the kids are in a race against time as they try to save their sibling and escape from Count Olaf, who is lurking nearby in a submarine of his own. <br /> <br />Unlike the earlier books in this series, Count Olaf is not really a central character here. Instead, this book introduces some new characters and helps shed light on old nemeses such as the hook-handed man.

LIONBOY: THE CHASE picks up right where the first book in this wonderfully entertaining trilogy left off, and the pace of this engaging sequel keeps right up with the speed of an express train. <br /> <br />Charlie is off to Venice with the aid of King Boris of Bulgaria, hoping to find where his scientist parents, who seemed to be on the verge of finding a cure for asthma, are being kept prisoner.

Is it his slithering, hissing way? Might it be those pointed, yellow teeth? Probably most ten-year-old boys would not be happy living in the shadow of the strange and frightening Basil. But Measle has no choice, as he is an orphan and must now live miserably in his guardian's dark, cold house. The one nice thing is the room at the top of the house that contains a most marvelous train set. Sometimes, when Basil is working on the train, he allows Measle to watch. But despite these moments of happiness, Measle is terribly nervous about something that lurks overhead and seems to be watching his every move. <br /> <br />Measle's real adventure begins when he dares to play with Basil's train and is caught. The mad wizard, or \\"Wrathmonk,\\" quickly shrinks Measle to the size of one of the little village people. It doesn't take long for the clever Measle to figure out that Basil has been doing some really evil spells and that many of the \\"villagers\\" are real people turned into plastic. He accidentally discovers that, by feeding them carrot bits, they can become real again. Becoming real helps them all realize that perhaps together they can escape from Basil's horrible spell. However, in order to do this, they must come up with intelligent plans and face some formidable adventures. By far the most fun comes when they reverse one of Wrathmonk's spells and turn him into a giant cockroach! <br /> <br />This is a fun little book with just the right amount of scary. Like Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, it will be an especially popular selection for grades 4 through 6. There is a sequel on the way, so the adventures of Measle and his friends are just beginning. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sally M. Tibbetts	2004-09-17

He is Shredderman, who single-handedly saved his school from the bullying of Bubba Bixby. In SHREDDERMAN: ATTACK OF THE TAGGER, the second book in the Shredderman series, Nolan has a new problem: someone is painting graffiti all over Nolan's town and trying to blame it on Shredderman. Nolan must try to catch the tagger while keeping his superhero identity secret. <br /> <br />Armed with his digital camera, a popular website, and an email list that includes everyone in school, Nolan sets out to discover the identity of the tagger. He suspects the principal's son but needs proof before anyone will believe him. Nolan's resourceful use of technology is a big part of his Shredderman identity, but Shredderman also forces him to push his limits of physical endurance. One hilarious spy mission has Nolan hiding in a smelly trash bag with flaps cut in the side to see and a straw to help him breathe. <br /> <br />A number of new issues are introduced in SHREDDERMAN: ATTACK OF THE TAGGER. The issue of privacy is a big part of this book. The backpacks and desks of all the children are searched for spray paint. Law enforcement officials get involved. Nolan worries that they will trace his website, which is registered under his parents' names. All the sneaking around he has done trying to catch the tagger makes him a suspect in the case. <br /> <br />Nolan is lucky to have supportive adults in his life: his parents give him a lot of freedom, he knows people in his community, and he even has an adult sidekick! What he continues to lack, though, is friends his own age. Shredderman may be the school hero, but his classmates still treat Nolan like he's a nerd. It would be nice to see Nolan's Shredderman identity help give him the confidence to make new friends. <br /> <br />As usual, author Wendelin Van Draanen uses humor to explore issues that impact young people. SHEDDERMAN: ATTACK OF THE TAGGER features a number of embarrassing moments for Nolan, and enough potty humor to keep readers engaged. Dynamic illustrations by Brian Biggs highlight the book's humor. The Shredderman.com website also adds an interactive element to the Shredderman series. The website includes some excellent tips for budding reporters. This, together with Van Draanen's message that kids have the potential to be heroes, is likely to inspire young readers to seek truth and justice in their own communities. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah A.

Now, with LEAPING BEAUTY, Maguire turns his considerable creative retelling talents back to a younger audience, with a collection of eight fractured fairy tales featuring animals in the lead roles. <br /> <br />The title story (which opens the book) is actually one of the weakest of the bunch, as Maguire chooses a fairly straightforward approach to tell of the young frog princess who is transformed from Weeping Beauty to Sleeping Beauty to Leaping Beauty. More entertaining are the later stories, such as \\"Hamster and Gerbil,\\" a pair of adopted siblings who happen upon a cottage made of pet food and its owner, a nefarious porcupine who is also a gourmet cook. <br /> <br />It seems that Maguire had a great deal of fun coming up with the names of stories and characters. There's Little Red Robin Hood, who wanted \\"to rob the rich birds of the forest and give their worms to the poor birds of the forest.\\" And there's the heroine of \\"Rumplesnakeskin,\\" a lovely blonde sheep named Norma Jean, who wears tight sweaters and desperately wants to break into the movies. <br /> <br />Some of this might go over young readers' heads, but they'll still enjoy Maguire's clever plot twists and his sometimes snarky humor. LEAPING BEAUTY is a great next step for kids who have grown out of THE STINKY CHEESE MAN but who are not yet ready for the more sophisticated fairy tale retellings of Robin McKinley or Donna Jo Napoli. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl	2004-09-17

The neighborhood is already bursting with gossip, even before the new family moves in. Tommy is known to be a \\"handful\\" and \\"had been in trouble with the police.\\" <br /> <br />Ellie meets Tommy Bowers at the peak of her boredom. It's her birthday, and instead of celebrating with friends, Ellie is home alone drinking lemonade out of a wine glass. She had to cancel her birthday party because Rosie O'Leary from school was having hers on the same day, and she sent out her invitations before Ellie. And to make matters worse, Ellie wasn't even invited to Rosie's party! <br /> <br />Tommy Bowers sees Ellie on her front porch and calls her over. He's examining the Watson's porch and looking under it. The Watsons are elderly sisters who live together and would never notice or hear them. Under the Watson's porch is spacious and private --- the perfect place for a secret hideout! Tommy proposes that they use the space to hold a special magic camp for all the neighborhood kids on Sunday mornings. Ellie agrees to help, and thinks that she may always go along with Tommy's plans: \\"There's something about Tommy Bowers that makes me want to say yes to everything he asks. He could ask me to run away from home with him or skip school or take a nap in my parents' bed, which even I'm not allowed to do. And I'd probably say yes. I'm thinking this could be the rule to our friendship from now on.\\" <br /> <br />Ellie's parents are not happy about their daughter hanging out with a troublesome boy. Despite their concern, Ellie finds herself completely smitten with Tommy. She has a crush on him that is very different from her other crushes: \\"This is something else. I feel as if I've swallowed a space capsule and I'mlaunched in a flash of light, my stomach full of Day-Glo or sequins or something sparkling inside.\\" <br /> <br />When Tommy gets in trouble again --- this time involving Ellie --- it's up to him to prove to both Ellie's parents and his own that he can change his ways. <br /> <br />UNDER THE WATSON'S PORCH is a tender story about an important relationship in a young girl's life.

T. Anderson's masterful new fantasy novel. In addition to being genuinely scary, Anderson's novel also manages to be wickedly clever and laugh-out-loud funny at the same time. <br /> <br />If you just look at the book's jacket, you'd think THE GAME OF SUNKEN PLACES was one of those old-time adventure novels. And, in many ways, you'd be right. The story does feel very old-fashioned, even though it's set in the present day. Part of the book's nostalgic feel comes from the plot. There's the eccentric (borderline insane) uncle living in a ramshackle mansion in the woods of Vermont, for one thing. Gregory and his best friend Brian travel by train to stay with Gregory's uncle during their autumn school vacation. <br /> <br />Uncle Max meets them with a horse and carriage, brings them to the isolated mansion, and takes away all their modern-day possessions, leaving them with nothing to wear but old-fashioned nightgowns and knickerbockers. The two friends find themselves in an attic nursery, filled with toys from the past, including the mysterious \\"Game of Sunken Places\\" board game. <br /> <br />As soon as Brian and Gregory turn over the hourglass timer that starts the game, they get the feeling that this is no simple game of Parcheesi. Instead, the game board, which represents the dark woods outside the mansion, is filled with sinister characters like the ogre Snarth, the mysterious opponent Jack Stimple, and the bitter elf Wee Sniggleping, who spends all his time convincing Brian and Gregory that he's not like one of those cheerful Keebler Elves. The boys meet these real-life characters as they navigate the game board, answering riddles and solving puzzles along the way, and the plot has as many twists and turns as the game board itself does. <br /> <br />The action-packed plot is reason enough to pick up THE GAME OF SUNKEN PLACES; what sets this novel apart, though, is the details. From Gregory's wisecracks --- many of which make no sense but are nonetheless hilarious --- to bizarre descriptions of Hummel figurines (\\"Little German children, wearing lederhosen, kissed while carpets of fungus crawled and devoured them\\"), the book is filled with quirky, sometimes creepy surprises that may have readers falling off the edge of their seats with laughter. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl	2004-09-10

But truly, I loved all the stories --- there's not one dud in the bunch. <br /> <br />The tales are linked with fascinating notes of how they came to be written: Peck wrote his first short story because a magazine editor bribed him with three hundred dollars! He had thirty-six hours to write a thousand-word piece with a shocking ending. That story, \\"Priscilla and the Wimps,\\" has been published in many places and opened the door for his further short fiction (speaking personally, I'd like to send that editor a thank-you note). <br /> <br />Within the introduction and two pieces at the end of the book, the author gives his readers a unique gift. He invites us to write a story of our own --- and gives us the information to do so. I, for one, find that challenge irresistible! While writing these \\"how-to\\" pieces, Peck is true to form.

Sarah Klise have written a fun, clever sequel to their popular middle-grade novel, REGARDING THE FOUNTAIN. We find ourselves once again immersed in a mystery with the Geyser Creek Middle School sixth-grade class in REGARDING THE SINK. <br /> <br />The trouble begins with a clogged cafeteria sink. The smell is just awful and the student body can't stand it much longer. The sixth graders want their old friend, Florence Waters, to design a new sink for them. Florence previously designed a new fountain for their school when the school's drinking fountain sprang a leak. The children have many suggestions for Florence, including a winking sink and a sink with a built-in computer. But all of the letters to Florence go unanswered and the children fear the worst has happened. They then find out that Florence has gone to China to help the endangered Sinkiang Spotted Suckerfish. <br /> <br />The sixth grade class has their work cut out for them. While they are trying to raise money for a class trip to visit Florence, their school lunches are replaced with beans, the price of milk goes through the roof, and AIR-gate Inc. wants to replace rainstorms with man-made rain, which falls only at night. Are the sixth-graders and their patient teacher, Mr. Sam N., up to the challenge of solving these and other mysteries? <br /> <br />This entire story is told through letters, news reports, advertisements and drawings. At first I found this writing style distracting, but once I focused on the story contained in the letters, etc., I thoroughly enjoyed it. Children who are hesitant to read novels with small print and large chunks of text will eat up this book's lively format. <br /> <br />REGARDING THE SINK is a fun read for older elementary-aged students. I intend to pick up other books written by the talented author/illustrator team of Kate Klise and M. Sarah Klise. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Renee Kirchner (renee.kirchner@usa.net)	2004-09-07

Soren will forever have the memory of that fight in his mind and heart. What makes things worse is that it is soon clear to the guardians of Ga'Hoole that they have not heard the last from Soren's brother. Kludd is still very much alive and has a large following of \\"Pure Ones,\\" barn owls who think they are the superior owl species and that the Guardians should be wiped out. <br /> <br />In order to protect the Ga'Hoole tree and all it stands for, Soren and his group of special friends must go to the one place Soren hoped he would never see again --- they have to infiltrate the St. Aegolius Academy for orphaned Owls and find out what is happening there. Are the owls at \\"St. Aggies\\" connected to the \\"Pure Ones\\" in some way? <br /> <br />Soren and his friends must dig deep into their reservoirs of courage and intelligence to get into St. Aggies, to find out what the leaders there are planning, and to get out again. Soren and his group are not the only ones who find themselves face-to-face with terrifying circumstances, for all the owls who live and work in the Ga'Hoole tree find that they are being threatened and a great battle awaits them all. <br /> <br />Building on the owl world that she created in her other Ga'Hoole books, Kathryn Lasky captivates us with the gripping and terrifying events that fill the lives of these extraordinary owls. Many of them must face new challenges and confront old demons. There is no guarantee that Soren and his friends will all survive the new threats that confront them.

Lafayette never got a chance to meet his father; his dad died before Lafayette was even born. Though he misses having a dad to do boy stuff with, Lafayette didn't know the man enough to miss him personally. When his mother dies, though, Lafayette is crushed. He misses her terribly --- every day, with every thought.  <br />Lafayette's oldest brother Ty'ree misses their mother just as much. With both parents gone, Ty'ree is now responsible raising Laf and also looking out for middle brother Charlie who has just returned from doing time in a juvenile detention center. In addition to being full of sorrow, Ty'ree is bitter: If he didn't have to look after his younger brothers, Ty'ree would have been able to attend college. Now, he works like a dog in the mailroom for a big company and is tired all the time from trying to make ends meet. Laf tries not to ask too many questions, or cry too much, or to want things they can't afford.  On top of it all, Charlie just keeps acting out and getting in trouble.  If he caught by the police again, Charlie and Laf will be made wards of the court. <br />Author Woodson has a wonderful talent for writing about kids in tough situations.  You really understand how someone in Laf's position might feel.  This is a touching novel about a family trying to stay afloat through some really hard times. Their mother, whose name was Milagro, (Miracle in Spanish) was the center of the family and held them together. Now they must rely on each other while learning to deal with the death of their mother. They already got their one miracle --- can they stick together without one?<br />This is a quiet novel that you can read quickly.  All the action takes place in one day, but it never feels hurried or too busy.  If you are looking for a book that makes violence, gang life, and fighting brothers seem dramatic or glamorous, this is not the book for you.  But if you want to read a realistic story about how these elements of urban life affect a small, loving family, try reading MIRACLE'S BOYS. Laf has tremendous reserves of kindness and love, and the bravery to show his emotions when he feels them. This whole novel is sometimes very sad, but it ends on a hopeful note. And as is usual with this author's work, it's also very beautiful.  <br />   --- (...)	2004-07-13

When the new substitute teacher, Mr. Moffat, asks Lucy's class to keep journals, she writes everything, hoping Mr. Moffat can and will keep it all secret.  Lucy writes her real, hardcore feelings about her best friend, her secret love, and her dream to write poetry one day. She also writes about the daily upsets that grind her down-her nasty old apartment building, her griping mother, and Andy, a hostile boy in her class who lives in her apartment complex with his mean stepfather. Andy, on the other hand, doesn't write at all. He just draws jet fighters, explosions, soldiers and mean cartoons of Mr. Moffat and the kids in his class. <br />Lucy wants to write poems like the ones Mr. Moffat puts up on the blackboard each week. But she doesn't believe she can write good verse because Lucy can't see any beauty in her life. Her mother's apartment is so small, Lucy doesn't even have a bedroom. Los Angeles is too smoggy, too full of cars and pollution ---  the sky isn't even blue anymore. In stark contrast, Lucy's dad has a beautiful house in San Francisco, and a gorgeous new wife. But Lucy is so unhappy when she visits them that she can still see nothing good.  <br />Then, one great day, a flock of ducks land in the apartment complex's pool.  Lucy writes all about them, getting super involved in their lives. A change happens with all the kids who live in the complex. Even Andy begins to like the ducks; he starts drawing the flock and scenes of the pond instead of his usual grisly war pictures.  Andy begins writing, too.  And when he does, he tells Mr. Moffat a very big secret.  One so big, it could save his life.  <br />Lucy is so real, she feels like you've known her forever. You even grow to like and understand Andy, although it takes a little longer.  And once you find out his secret, you really start rooting for him. There even is a very dramatic, surprise conclusion....but I won't give any of that away. <br />My favorite thing about this novel is the poems, poems that Mr. Moffat writes on the board, as well as Lucy's and the other student's ideas about each verse.  And none of the poems are really hard to understand, or too long. They're all simple poems that are easy to read and to like. They sound best when read aloud. It's a nice way to learn a little about poetry, and see if you like it.  <br />FOR YOUR EYES ONLY moves quickly and really holds your interest. It's got a lot of funny parts, too. It is beautifully written, and really shows you that you can make your own beauty --- through art and poetry --- no matter how ugly your surroundings may be.

When their truly evil teacher Ms. Ribble announces she will be retiring and forces the class to write identical sappy cards to mark the occasion, the boys have a better idea: they'll write one of their comic books featuring the heroic Captain Underpants instead, and demonstrate their amazing creativity. <br />In the comic strip, Ms. Ribble becomes the Wedgie Woman. She wreaks havoc by bestowing extremely painful wedgies on her enemies until she is undone by the valiant but tubby Captain Underpants. Needless to say, Ms. Ribble does not appreciate the boys' creative efforts and they're sent off to the principal's office once more.  <br />But the adventure certainly doesn't end there. It just so happens that in the office, the school secretary has left an unfinished draft the school's schedule on her computer. The opportunity to liven things up by rearranging the schedule proves irresistible and the boys make a few minor changes while they wait to be reprimanded.

I do not to like short stories: they have the annoying tendency to end just as I'm beginning to enjoy the characters. But I do love legend, myths and fairytales. Bruce Coville challenged his fellow author to submit stories --- their common theme being that the protagonist was caught in a state where he or she isn't quite human. This collection of mermaids, gorgons and selkies provide a wonderfully entertaining time while asking us to wonder at what precisely does it mean to be human, a question people have been asking since the beginning of time.<br />All of the stories are well written, which I expected considering that the credits read like an all-star line up of contemporary fantasy writers. The thing that makes the anthology interesting is how the stories play together in the mind to form a single work even as they remain separate creations. Dusie, from Nancy Springer's \\"Becoming\\" is the girl at the next desk at school who has awaken to find that her hair has been transformed into snakes while Princess Eleanor in Jude Man Dell's \\"Princess Dragon Blood\\" is both a fairytale princess and a mighty warrior at the same time.  <br />The question of how and when are we human and when we are not is presented both forcefully and subtly. The authors use the short story form well, allowing the reader to think about the stories and ask themselves what the question means both personally and to humans in general. HALF HUMAN also explores what it feels like to not \\"fit in\\". While these characters may have extras --- like wings or tails --- their stories are touching and familiar to any kid who feels left out. If Harry Potter whet your appetite for fantasy or if you simply want to read something a bit shorter, pick up HALF-HUMAN. Your reading time will be time well spent.<br />   --- (...)	2004-07-12

Thomas has learned to be very happy there. So he isn't pleased when his father tells him that they must go back home. Thomas has come to feel at home in Belthorp. His father reminds him that they were only in Belthorp for a purpose, and that purpose has been completed now.<br />Thomas, an honest boy, has always been truthful with his neighbor, Mrs. Dalrymple. He told her about the space ship the size of a golf ball that he and his father traveled to Belthorp in. Of course, to fit inside it, they had to shrink down very tiny. Then, when they got out, they zoomed right back up. And Thomas told his best friend Mickey that the moon was nothing special. He and his father flew around it twice on their way to Belthorp --- a navigational error --- and he didn't know why anybody would want to go there. But somehow, Mrs. Dalrymple and Mickey just thought Thomas had a great imagination. In fact, Mickey gets mad at Thomas for telling him that he has to leave Belthorp to go back to Ormingat. He thinks Thomas should just tell <BR>the truth, that he's really moving to Canada like Patrick says.<br />Thomas is angry enough at having to leave earth that he tells his father he won't do it. He's forgotten Ormingat, even the language. But his father says he has no choice.<br />Then something happens to change that.

Maria Rind lives in Williamsburg, Virginia, two years before the Revolutionary War begins. She came to Williamsburg when her father was invited by Thomas Jefferson to start a newspaper. This new paper would print the viewpoint of the colonists and their grievances against England. Other newspapers didn't dare to do that. Her father won a government contract to publish The Virginia Gazette. But then he died. Now Maria's mother, Clementina Rind, must take over his newspaper and keep making money from it, or else her family will become destitute.<br />Maria is only nine-years-old, but she wants very much to help her mother run the newspaper. But Clementina says that Maria's older brother, William, will do that. Maria must take care of her three younger brothers, cook, and run the household while Clementina manages the newspaper. Maria does what she is told, but she believes that if she just knew how to read and write better, her mother would let her help with the paper, too. The only problem is, while her father was sick, her mother couldn't teach Maria her lessons, and Maria can barely read. She doesn't know how to cook, either, and she has to learn everything the hard way --- she has to figure things out by herself because her mother tells Maria not to bother her while she's working on the paper.<br />Maria works hard to teach herself to read, and she finds ways to help her mother with the paper, too. In fact, Maria figures out a solution to one serious problem that nobody else thinks of. This book is based on a true story about a real little girl, Maria Rind, who lived in Williamsburg before and during the Revolutionary War. Her mother, Clementina, really did run the newspaper after her husband died, the only woman ever to do so in the Virginia colony. <br />The book includes several sections of history about Williamsburg, printing, children of the time, and what happened to the real Maria and her family. It has lots of photographs, and the story it tells is well-researched and accurate. You will want to find out how Maria copes with the tragic and dangerous things that happen in her life. And you will see how very unfair life could be to little girls in those days, even when they were smarter than their brothers!<br />   --- Reviewed by Tamara Penny	2004-07-12

It's 1920 in Bozeman Alabama, and the Corbin family has just been blessed with a baby boy named Petey in a hospital. However, he looks completely different from other ordinary babies. Because of this, the doctors misdiagnose him as an idiot and think he's severely feebleminded. But Petey has a severe case of cerebral palsy, a condition that's caused by brain damage and results in poor control and weakness of the muscles before, during, or briefly after birth. Two years later, the family sends him to the Insane Asylum in Warm Springs Montana because they can't care for him anymore. That's when his new life begins.<br />When he gets to the Insane Asylum, he gets put in the Infant's Ward. That's when his life looks like it's going to take a turn for the worst. The room is crowded, he isn't cared for properly by the nurses, and he's lonely because he has no friends. But then he starts to become really good friends with Esteban, a worker at the hospital. But that friendship doesn't last long because Esteban has to leave the hospital. When Petey is eleven years old he gets moved to the Men's Ward.<br />While living in the Men's Ward, Petey makes friends with the mice and a nine-year-old boy named Calvin, who's mildly retarded and has severe club feet. They start to talk and do everything together. Petey also makes friends with Joe, Cassie, and Owen, three of the workers at the hospital. Unfortunately, they all had to leave the hospital too. After living at the hospital for a long time, Calvin and Petey get transferred to different nursing homes.<br />Meanwhile, in another part of the story, Trevor Lodd has just moved to Bozeman Montana because his parents want to get better jobs, and he doesn't think it's fair at all. It doesn't get any better when he's walking home from school one day, and sees three neighborhood bullies throwing snowballs at Petey who now lives at the Bozeman Nursing Home. After Trevor chases them off, he starts to become really good friends with Petey.He's determined to make Petey's life better by getting him a new wheelchair because the one he uses is old and is falling apart, and by finding Petey's old friend Calvin. Will he be able to find Calvin? Will he get him a new wheelchair? Will they still be friends?<br />I liked this book because it reminded me that even though I have cerebral palsy myself and can't do some of the things that normal people can do, I can still make a lot of friends, have a happy, normal, and productive life, and do a lot of other things by myself. How would you have felt if you were Petey or one of his friends?

CLEM'S CHANCES tells the story of Clem Fontayne, a fourteen-year-old boy in 1860, just prior to the outbreak of the Civil War. Sonia Levitin is an expert at writing historical novels for young people, so it is no surprise that she is able to convey so much information in just under 200 pages. <br />Clem's father left the family a year earlier to seek his fortune in the California gold fields, and hasn't been heard from since. Clem is then left entirely alone when his mother and baby sister die during a fever epidemic. After his mother's death, Clem tries to carry on, until neighbors, the Warrens, find him starving and struggling to stay alive. They take Clem in as a \\"good deed\\", but life with them is no picnic.  They treat Clem little better than a slave.  <br />But life with the Warrens doesn't last long. After being accused of a crime he didn't commit, Clem is forced to leave the Warrens home. Confused as to where to go or what to do, Clem decides to try and find his father (if his father is even still alive). He heads West --- penniless and desperate --- and finally finds work in a livery stable, earning room and board at a local saloon. But like the Warrens, Clem gets caught up in trouble and he must escape the area to save his life. <br />Once again penniless and wandering, Clem applies for a job riding for the Pony Express. Instead of being hired to ride, he is offered a job as an animal tender driving the animals to a new station. Working with the Pony Express is just the start of Clem's practical education as he travels across the country to California. Along the way, he learns about politics, and meets many different types of people including an African American cowboy and a group of Mormons traveling to Salt Lake City. Eventually, he makes it to California --- but after all that's happened, what are Clem's Chances of ever seeing his father?  <br />CLEM'S CHANCES is packed with information. However good Levitin is at history, though, she is best when she isdescribing the interpersonal relations between Clem and the people he meets.

Paul assures his dad he won't ever lie again. Why should he have to leave all his friends around the pools of Richmond and slop a bunch of hogs? <br />Like it or not, Paul doesn't have much choice about working on the farm --- his dad is driving him and there's no getting out of it. When they arrive at the huge farm, owned by a distant relative, Paul gets out of the car and a big, barrel-chested dog named Einstein runs up and nips his rear end. But Paul was raised to be polite --- despite his lying incident --- and he is very nice to everybody, even the dog. <br />He also works hard. Know what Paul's first job turns out to be?

Bryce runs through most of the book, sometimes literally, just to stay away from her.<br />And of course, Juli sees all this from an entirely different perspective. The guy needs help in life; she's more than happy to give it to him. Besides, his eyes make her feel weak all over. Sometimes, she just sits in her driveway and stares at his house, wondering why he won't come out.<br />Kids aren't the only ones in this book who have things to learn, either. So do parents. There's an eye-opener! And if you read it, you'll come to see things differently, yourself. Like, should you be honest or should you be polite? And what do appearances have to do with reality?<br />You'll want to read this book to find out what happens when everything flips and Bryce stops running from Juli and she starts running from him. Is there something more to Juli than a dumpy yard? Is Bryce nothing but a gorgeous pair of blue eyes? Are these two made for each other, or should they avoid each other like the plague?<br />  (...)	2004-07-12

At the start of A PIECE OF THE WORLD, a 12-year-old girl named Calder is sent to live with her Grandmother in Weldon, Vermont. Calder's mother needs time to herself; she and Calder's father have just gotten a divorce. At first look, Weldon is horribly boring for Calder and so she decides to go on a hike to see some local scenery. It is then that she discovers a giant boulder set deep in the woods. She later learns that the rock is actually a serpentine boulder, which broke off from a giant glacier hundreds of thousands of years ago. Soon Calder becomes friends with a boy her age named Walt, whose father owns the wooded property, and Mr. Cooley, a kind old man and a retired geologist. Together, they try to save the rock from a rich man who wants to buy it, and from the Weldon Development Society, who want to turn the area into a tourist attraction.<br />A PIECE OF THE WORLD, with a beautiful title and a sweet story, is simply written with memorable character. It is a very touching story with a satisfying ending. There are a few black and white drawings of some of the characters and scenery. A little old-fashioned, the novel's themes of friendship and ecological concern are still universal.<br />  Reviewed by Jean, student and reading diva	2004-07-12

There have been many tributes to the veterans of World War II but, as with any story, there are other points of views waiting to told. Jubal Shoemaker is thirteen years old when his older brother Bud, a strict Quaker, is called to serve in the war. But Bud is a pacifist and does not feel he can join the service and remain true to his moral purpose in life. <br />Instead of joining up like so many others his age, Bud decides to become a conscientious objector and serve in the Civilian Public Service. This action puts him at odds with nearly all of his town. It even sets him against some members of his own family. \\"Conchies\\" (what conscientious objectors were called) are not respected during times of war and soon the Shoemaker's are subjected to harassment due to Bud's decision. Signs reading \\"Your son is a slacker\\" or \\"Your Boy's Yellow\\" appear wherever the Shoemakers go.<br />Jubal is a normal thirteen-year-old who just wants his peers at school and in his town to like and respect him --- especially Daria, a pretty girl with an older soldier boyfriend and brothers in the army. Daria cannot bring herself to understand Bud's stand, and despite her friendship with Jubal she strikes out against his brother. Yet, somehow the two manage to remain friends even as the town turns its back on the Shoemakers. The stress of standing firm with Bud takes its toll on the whole family, especially since a local radio host keeps the controversy pot simmering with his anti-Conchie broadcasts. It doesn't help that he's Daria's father.<br />SLAP YOUR SIDES is a very difficult book to read at times. Kerr does a superb job of recreating the atmosphere of the war years for the reader. This is in part due to our being used to thinking of that time as a clear cut era without the confusing shades of gray while Kerr points out that that kind of clarity never really existed. Kerr asks us to question which is the more moral standpoint and whether doing something wrong can ever be right. I enjoyed SLAP YOUR SIDES because the characters and their relationships with each other never fail to feel truthful. This is not a book to occupy a rainy afternoon, it's a book for life.<br />   --- (...)	2004-07-12

Roxie wakes up one morning, opens the front door, and sees snow filling their whole porch, from floor to roof.

Many Easterners were on the trails at that time, looking for land, business opportunities, and better lives. They traveled across the country in wagon trains to California and Oregon. But the people who headed for California on May 12, 1846, under the leadership of George Donner, did not arrive at their destination safely. Instead, they headed into history. <br />To readers, the name \\"The Donner Party\\" = cannibals. Beset with bad leadership, bad luck, bad timing, and bad decisions, the tragic Donner Party suffered unbelievable hardships. Trapped in the Sierra Nevada Mountains during a bitter winter, only 60 miles from their destination, the survivors began eating the bodies of those who had died.<br />THE JOURNAL OF DOUGLAS ALLEN DEEDS tells the story of The Donner Party through the eyes of a boy. Douglas is a 15-year-old orphan moving West to build a life for himself and become somebody. All he has is his horse. Without a wagon or any money to buy one, Douglas is grateful that Mr. Donner lets him hitch his dreams to the wagon train. He can shoot well, and he shares whatever. He becomes good friends with Edward Breen, whose generous family takes him in and makes him feel loved and needed. Douglas and Edward share their plans for making their fortunes when they get to California.<br />But the settlers don't make good time. They travel only a few miles a day. Months go by, during which other wagon trains arrive at their destinations, but The Donner Party just keeps slogging along the trail. All of them are greenhorns, even the leaders. And they are following the advice in a book written by Mr. Lansford Hastings. Everybody on the wagon train believes Mr. Hastings' book as if it were the Bible. Following his trails and his shortcuts, they ignore the advice of a mountain man who tells them that the trails Hastings took on horseback can't be followed by wagons and oxen. The settlers inthe Donner Party believe that it's the mountain man who's lying, and that Mr. Hastings will meet them at Fort Bridger, just as he promised he would, and lead them to California. In fact, they believe Mr. Hastings all the way to their entrapment in the Sierra Nevadas.<br />In this book, you will meet every kind of human being there is --- the gullible, the boastful, the self-sacrificing, and the stingy. There are those who give their lives so others can live, and those who refuse to share their food with people who are starving to death. There are those who reduce themselves to cannibalism, and those who refuse to justify such acts. Who survives? At what cost? Reading this book will make you think about what's really most important in life.<br />   --- (...)	2004-07-12

Just got up one day and ran off, leaving her son with her boyfriend, who wasn't even Grover's father. Grover entered the system before he was two years old.<br />Ben has survived the system by keeping his rules. The biggest rule is: don't get close to people. Whenever he has to leave a place, he blanks it out of his mind and leaves a clean slate for whoever is next in the lineup. He keeps three goals in his mind all the time: start with now, stick it out until he's 18, and walk away from the system forever.<br />But when he meets Grover, another foster kid with Ben's eighth foster family, he forgets his rules before he even realizes that he's forgotten them. He starts to care. And he worries. Especially when he finds out that Grover's mother wants back into her son's life. But the foster family thinks it's great. They're helping her get her act together. They say that she's trying her best, and that Ben should give her a break and stop letting Grover get so attached to him. They say he should let go of Grover.<br />But he can't.

From Winslow Homer's \\"Two Girls Looking at a Book\\" to Norman Rockwell's \\"Girl at Mirror,\\" the illustrations provide endless possibilities for sharing their thoughts and emotions as they view the paintings --- and opening the door to a wealth of discussion by putting themselves into the painting and letting their imaginations fly.<br />For example, one lovely painting by Luther Van Gorder entitled \\"Japanese Lanterns\\" portrays two small girls admiring the wonders of paper lanterns being hung in the garden. Their parents are preparing for a party in the year 1895, and the girls are all dressed up to attend this \\"grown-up\\" event. The magical glow of light and the curious smiles of the girls create a joyful picture that makes us recall our own happy discoveries. Can you remember being amazed by something as magical as a Japanese lantern? Feeling the tingle of anticipation before a family party?<br />Each work of art is accompanied by a brief essay that sets the stage for viewing the art, and asks questions to start kids on the path to seeing deeper within themselves. Short biographies on each artist are included in the back. An added bonus --- the cover is designed in the form of a picture frame, allowing the reader to insert their favorite reproduction of some of these paintings from a packet that's included with the book.

This summer really would be something special and a far cry from the hard life with his drinking parents. \\"The boy,\\" as Gary Paulsen calls himself in this semi-autobiographical story, finds himself absorbed in farm life. He learns to love the two bachelor brothers, Gunnar and Olaf, who employ his grandmother as their cook and regard her in the highest esteem.

Every night in the fishing village where he lives eleven-year-old David, a moon calf, sits alone by the shore watching the path of light that stretches across the sea until it almost touches the moon. Wondering where it goes, he decides to talk to Hans Krout, the cobbler, about it and learns that the cobbler has been out on the moon path himself. That same night Hans takes him to the shore and ties to teach him how to cross but David gets scared and falls into the water. Then one day he hears the voice of the Moon Angel down by the shore. Moon Angel makes people happy when they're sad, but he also takes something away from them. He tells David that he, Moon Angel, is the Master Cobbler, and David should have Hans bring him to the moon path again. That same night Hans and David make another trip down to the moon path, and this time David crosses it. Once he's on the other side he discovers that the path leads to a magical world behind the moon where David's adventure begins.<br />When he enters the magical world, the first thing he discovers is the Moon House where the Man in the Moon lives. It's dark and quiet, and every time David looks out a window, he sees something different. A few days later he discovers the Moon Garden. It's a peaceful place with a lot of children living in it. The children begin talking and playing with David, and they don't make fun of him like the children in the village where he lives, because they're all moon calves too. He leaves the Moon Garden, but the Man in the Moon decides that David will be allowed to go there for three days every month. During one of his visits he meets a girl named Phyllis, and they start to become really good friends. They do everything together. But five months later, the guardian of the children tells David that he can't come to the Moon Garden again because he will soon be 12 years old. Children can't live there once they're 12 years old because they have to learn how to become a grown man or woman. She alsotells him that Phyllis is a princess, and that he was really sent there to find the Wonder Box and the Know All Book in order to bring them back to the brown earth again. The guardian says he must first battle a giant and then see an old woman in a red petticoat, who will tell him what to do next. Then while in the Moon House one day, David sees the Moon Angel, and passes behind him.<br />Now David finds himself on the shore of the sea ten years in the future as a grown man. He goes to the old woman's cottage and learns that Adam and Eve lived in the Moon Garden, where the Moon Angel gave them the Wonder Box. He told them that it held the greatest joy in the world, the Know All Book, but not to open the box because, if they do, sorrow will come upon them. However, a few days later they opened it and end up captives of the Iron Giant in his Iron Castle. In order for David to find the Wonder Box and the Know All Book, he'll have to travel to the Iron Castle too, but he'll have to outsmart the giant in order to succeed. Will David win the battle, and get the Wonder Box and the Know All Book back to the brown earth?<br />I liked this book because it was very magical and exciting. If I had been David, I would have been sad to leave the Moon Garden, and scared to battle the giant. If you enjoy reading books about magical places, THE GARDEN BEHIND THE MOON is an excellent choice!<br />   --- (...)	2004-07-07

Rodzina has seen the face of tragedy several times over, and now it seems as if hope has turned its back on this homely immigrant from Poland.<br />Rodzina and many other orphaned children of all ages are being shipped out of Chicago on a train. They are going west to find new homes and establish new lives. At the time, the powers-that-be believed that working on farms as laborers would be good for these city orphans. Rodzina and many of the other orphans consider this change in circumstances to be a sentence to a life of slavery, and needless to say, Rodzina would rather live in an orphanage or even on the streets than face an existence in a strange place where she has to work in the fields from sun up to sun down day after day. Bitter, sharp and angry, Rodzina isolates herself from everyone else on the train as it clatters west. At each town where the train stops, a few more orphans find homes until Rodzina is the only one left, alone and unwanted.<br />Carefully researched, RODZINA tells us of a time when orphans were not to be trusted and were often treated little better than slaves or beasts of burden. It was not uncommon for orphans to have their teeth and limbs examined by prospective 'parents' at the time of 'adoption' to determine their worthiness as potential farmhands. In the back of the book, the reader will find a detailed history of the Orphan Train and other similar efforts to 'rehabilitate' orphaned and unwanted children.<br />Karen Cushman has received great acclaim for her historical novels, as she was awarded a Newbery Honor for CATHERINE, CALLED BIRDY and the Newbery Medal for THE MIDWIFE'S APPRENTICE.

Jamie misses Webb very much, and the case her mother is working on troubles her in ways she doesn't understand. She starts doing weird things. For example, she daydreams about Webb a lot, losing track of where she is, and runs her bike into a parked car before she comes back to reality.

In an eerie world where people have cold and hard hearts, twin baby boys are left at the doorstep of their uncle's house. They grow up into odd boys and are kept hidden from the world because of their strangeness. The only thing they have from their parents is a dulcimer. The dulcimer has a powerful attraction for William, the stronger of the twins, and he decides to take the wonderful instrument and flee. This is a dark, almost gothic story, where cruelty to children is commonplace. In a Dickensian world, where orphaned youngsters are thrown away or used for profit, William and his lonely little brother seem to be the pawns of chance.<BR>True to the Dickensian model, a stranger steps in to help the boys in their time of need, and we are relieved to have a happy ending.<br />Tor Seidler has infused small pieces of wry humor into his story, which adds to the weird nature of the book. For example, the horrible aunt and uncle are called Mr. and Mrs. Carbuncle. A carbuncle can be a gem, but it can also be a terrible sore. There is one aspect of the story that is puzzling: How can William leave his poor, defenseless brother in the home of his cruel aunt and uncle?

Yet, his new novel ABARAT, is quite different from his earlier children's work THE THIEF OF ALWAYS, which was a simple and spooky tale. ABARAT is a vast and colorful fantasy in the tradition of the Oz and Narnia stories. The world of Abarat grew out of a series of paintings the multi-talented Barker created. Inspired by his own imagination, he wrote the story of the paintings and the characters and places they portray. The book itself (the first in a projected 4-part series) is full of these vivid paintings helping to transport the reader to the new universe Barker has created.<br />The journey to Abarat is undertaken by the unassuming Candy Quakenbush, a 16-year-old girl from Chickentown, Minnesota. Driven to boredom, anger and frustration by her cruel teacher, alcoholic father and distracted mother, she becomes intrigued by the mysterious story of Henry Murkitt while writing a paper about the history of Chickentown (previously named Murkitt) for school. Henry died in a room of the Comfort Tree Hotel and left behind his sextant, used to navigate the seas. When her mean-spirited teacher rejects her school report, Candy flees the classroom and finds herself in a field outside of town mesmerized by a cloud and in front of a dilapidated lighthouse. Before she can solve the mystery of what a lighthouse is doing in the middle of Minnesota, she finds herself face to faces with a seven headed man. He/they tell her the lighthouse, amazingly, once sat on the coast of the sea of Izabella, a sea Candy, with some help from her new friends (yes, each head is a distinct personality) is able to summon after a dramatic battle with another monstrous creature. This sea carries Candy far from her home, her school, and all that is familiar. Yet, it draws her closer to Henry Murkitt.<br />And so begins Candy's journey to Abarat, a land of 25 islands; one for each hour of the dayand one for the time in-between time. The isles of Abarat are as diverse as their populations. Candy is enthralled by Abarat and its citizens, but those she meets think she, as a visitor from the Hereafter, as our world is known, is most exotic. But Candy hardly has time to take in the wondrous sites around her. Her presence is immediately known by several sinister men who realize the threat she poses to their evil plans for domination. It seems Candy was destined to make this journey (ah! now the prologue is beginning to make sense) and besides that she is a scrappy fighter! Soon she is teamed up with a gentle character named Malingo whom she has freed from slavery and together the flee the dark and powerful forces around them. This duo is surely destined for great things, narrow escapes and amazing adventures!<br />What usually makes a fantasy novel successful is enough of the familiar to make the New World easier to visualize and understand, to make it somehow more plausible. This element of familiarity is what has made other Barker novels, most notably WEAVEWORLD so wonderful and engaging. With ABARAT he discards this formula and presents many new creatures inhabiting a truly original landscape. While in many ways this works, it is a bit overwhelming and distracting. It is unbelievable that Candy would not be paralyzed with shock at the spectacular newness she encounters: she seems to so seamlessly make the transition between worlds. And, I can only hope that Barker comes back to sew up all the loose ends he has left dangling in this first installment.<br />However, Barker has succeeded in bringing a unique vision to his readers. Perhaps the pace of ABARAT is so frantic is because it is so clear in Barkers mind: it is obvious he has a whole new mythology he would like to share and he can't get it onto the page fast enough. As a novel, ABARAT is dense, detailed and sometimes confusing. As a landscape and fairy tale it is enticing, dark and beautiful. Most likelythe young readers this book is intended for will not be critical of the occasional sloppiness in the text and most likely their attention will not be lost through the mental and physical obstacle course Candy finds herself in when she journeys to Abarat.<br />   --- (...)	2004-07-07

For Hercules, the world in which you and I live is full of dangers and terrors. There are dogs and cats that might eat him, stairs that he might fall down, and bikes that might flatten him. Even the breakfast table is a dangerous place, since it's full of large, often moving objects.<br />Hercules is relieved, therefore, when he discovers that there is another world just right for him, because it is built for creatures that are as small as he is. Purely by chance, he finds a city in the walls of the house in which his family lives that was built and is occupied by mice. Soon, Hercules is a much-loved member of the almost utopian mouse society and he thinks that his life will forever be good.<br />With a sometimes startling imagination, Melissa Glenn Haber has created a world in which creatures of the same size can understand one another and the bizarre is not questioned. At times, our credulity simply cannot stretch as far as it is asked to do. The relationship that exists between two very dissimilar animal species seems to be too unlikely.

Moonlit chases, hidden hiding places, and even a secret code help to solve the mystery. Is this the new sequel to THE DA VINCI CODE? Nope --- it's an equally entertaining novel for younger readers. CHASING VERMEER encourages kids to use all their creativity and problem-solving skills to tackle a real-life mystery surrounding the elusive painter Johannes Vermeer.<br />Calder Pillay and Petra Andalee are both a little odd. Their intellectual curiosity and their unique hobbies fit right in, though, with their eccentric families and with their creative classmates at the University of Chicago Lab School. When three mysterious letters show up in their neighborhood and seem linked to the theft of a famous Vermeer painting, a chain of coincidences brings Calder and Petra together to help solve the crime.<br />First-time author Blue Balliett seems to enjoy playing with coincidences, both plausible and far-fetched, and the theme of chance and coincidence cleverly runs through the novel. The novel, with its high-profile crime of a well-known painting (secretly reproduced on the book underneath the dust jacket), also seeks to inspire young people to appreciate art as both dynamic and relevant to their lives. \\"Children were thinking about Vermeer, too. They were comparing, writing, and visiting museums with friends. Many said that they hadn't realized how cool old pictures could be.\\"<br />The novel's illustrations breathe almost as much life into the book as the text does. Illustrator Brett Helquist (best known for illustrating Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events) includes a full-page illustration for each chapter. Pay attention! Some of the drawings reveal a secret that careful readers can help uncover.<br />With its emphasis on puzzle-solving, CHASING VERMEER is reminiscent of classic novels like THE WESTING GAME. Its focus on connections and coincidences will remind many of HOLES, and its art-related mystery calls to mind FROM THE SECRET FILES OF MRS. BASIL E. FRANKWEILER. In other words, CHASING VERMEER deserves a spot alongside many well-loved children's books. It's that good.<br />   --- (...)	2004-07-07

Tiger is the child of humanitarian aid workers living in a country torn by famine and war. When their government asks them to evacuate the country, the family must make a difficult trek across the mountains to make their way back home.<br />The day they leave their village, Tiger rescues a fish that is slowly suffocating in a mud puddle. As the family can only take what belongings they can carry on their backs, Tiger's choice to carry the fish seems absurd. But as the mud puddle is quickly drying up, Tiger is worried that the fish will die.<br />\\"'All the animals here have died --- and lots of the people,'\\" says Tiger's father. \\"'One fish is just one fish after all.'\\"<br />However, Tiger's parents, and the Guide who takes them across the border, help Tiger transport the fish. First the fish is carried in a cooking pot, then in a water bottle, and eventually in Tiger's mouth. The people who they meet along the way think what Tiger is doing is strange, but they are also impressed by the compassion the child has for another living creature.<br />FISH is L.S. Matthews's first book. The focus and simplicity of this tale make it appealing to a broad range of readers. Tiger narrates the book. It is never clear whether Tiger is a boy or a girl. This makes it easier for the reader to identify with Tiger and perhaps also with the adventures that Tiger and the fish encounter.<br />This book is a simple story about a child and a fish. It is also about trying to make a difference, even if it is just in the life of one being. What Tiger does for the fish is no different from what Tiger's parents do as aid workers. Each makes a difference in the world one life at a time.<br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah A. Wood	2004-07-07

The pace of the life there has a quiet peace that brings happiness to him. Despite missing his mother, he soon settles into the quiet but busy life that the small community offers. His grandmother, Alida, is really what is most important to him, and it is she who counsels, loves and is the female force in his young life.<br />During his stay with her, they go to his cousin Kristina's home, as she is ready to give birth. She and the other women who gather to help in this event weave a magic spell as he listens to their voices and watches as they work together. After the baby is born and the lovely quilt is brought out, he is aware of something most special happening. It is then that he hears all the family stories of the quilt, and he observes:<br />\\"The room grew quiet, breathlessly silent, so the boy could hear Kristina breathing as she slept upstairs, and he looked at the women's hands holding the edges of the quilt and none of them gripped hard but seemed instead to almost caress the cloth and he knew that he was seeing a sweet thing, a dear thing, like when his mother's face was there looking down on him as he awakened from a nap, or when his grandmother looked at him when she held him.\\"<br />This is not a book with great adventure, but is rather reflective and gentle in tone. Sometimes \\"the boy\\" seems more mature in his observations than most six-year-olds. Because of his life and the times, however, it all seems more plausible.<br />While this is considered a companion to THE COOKCAMP and ALIDA'S SONG, it is not necessary to read them to enjoy and understand the characters or story in THE QUILT. While younger readers (ages 8-12) can read this book with ease, the themes will probably find more appeal for teens and most definitely for adults.

The sickly sole survivor of a large litter, his eyes are open weeks too soon, he has very large ears and an unusually small stature for a mouse. Despereaux seems doomed to have a short existence.<br />Fortunately, this special mouse lives. He hears sounds that no one else can hear and he's able to read. These two special talents, the reader finds, can be dangerous for a mouse. One day Despereaux stumbles upon King Phillip and his daughter, Princess Pea. The mouse is drawn to the music the king plays for his daughter and soon finds himself talking --- and falling in love --- with the Princess.<br />Despereaux's brother Furlough watches the scene unfold with growing horror. A mouse talking to a human and allowing themselves to be touched? Such a thing could never be allowed or it could mean the death of the mouse community. Furlough scurries off and tells his father and the mouse council exactly what he saw. It is then that Despereaux's fate is decided.<br />Meanwhile, a devious rat named Roscuro lives in what is known as the deep downs with his fellow rats and prisoners of the King. What makes Roscuro different from all the other rats is his growing obsession with light and soup.<br />And Miggery Sow is a poor dimwitted peasant girl who lives in the kingdom with her uncle. Mig does not really have an uncle; she was sold to a man by her father for a tablecloth, a hen and a handful of cigarettes. Why would a father do such a thing to his daughter? The reader may never know. One thing the reader knows for certain is that Mig wants to be a princess.<br />What will happen to each of these characters, and how are they ultimately connected?

It was a name her father gave her, a name given to her with affection because she was such a tiny baby. Unfortunately, some of the boys in school latch on to her nickname and persecute her until she feels as small as small can be. She wishes she was big and tough and able to show those boys a thing or two. With every passing day, her lack of inches becomes more and more of a worry.

Surely, she isn't going to stay under five feet tall for the rest of her life.<br />Chig gets so caught up in her own problem that she almost misses seeing what is happening to the people around her and to her town. It all begins when Chig realizes that some of the children in her class have only one spread on their sandwiches for lunch. It had always been the norm to have two. Clearly, things are getting very bad indeed if the children's parents can only afford one spread. She then notices that there are more and more men sitting and standing around the stove at the store.

This time, though, they are really scraping the bottom of the barrel. Having very little money, they are forced to stay at Uncle Wes's house in the historic city of Cape May.<br />Lily, full of anger at her lot in life, discovers that something very strange is going on in the old house. Objects seem to move around by themselves, someone puts jam in her shoes, and she receives strange phone calls. Then there are the secrets about her mother's family. How did strange Uncle Max die and why doesn't her mother talk about her family at all?<br />It isn't long before Lily realizes that, even though Uncle Max may be dead, he isn't gone. There is something that his restless ghost wants from her, and the sooner she finds out what it is, the better.<br />Laura Ruby pulls you into her extraordinary story from the very first page. There are in fact parallel stories being told: Lily's story and the story of the ghosts who live in Cape May. Both stories are sad at times, with lost souls looking for something that will give their existence (or the end of their existence) some meaning. Ruby keeps the two tales apart until the end of the book when they collide, the ghosts and the living people coming together in a fitting finale.<br />Gripping and beautifully written with highly visual descriptive passages and a touch of black humor, LILY'S GHOSTS will alternately touch and amuse the reader. It also encourages thought about the afterlife, and there will be times when one might feel compelled to turn on a few more lights or get up to see if the doors are locked.<br />   --- (...)	2004-07-01

Girls have to wear dresses to school and can't do entertaining things, like have their own paper route. Being a girl means you're not supposed to climb on the roof, or dig foxholes in the yard, or spy on the neighbors. And you're definitely not supposed to like your new baby sister, or have a crush on a friend who's normally nothing more than a stickball buddy.<br />Right?<br />Twelve-year-old Carolyn has never thought of herself as a girl. She prefers to keep her hair short and wants nothing to do with dresses, ruffles, or anything that remotely could be considered \\"girly.\\" But when her baby sister Nancy is born, Carolyn's thoughts toward girls begin to change as she sees that she's not alone in her family anymore.<br />Lots of gross descriptions and hilarious adventures keep this book moving, though in the end Carolyn disappointingly fails to balance her tomboy nature with the \\"girly\\" feelings she experiences. Furthermore, the lack of a timeline is a source of confusion. Though the reader never knows for certain the year in which the book takes place, it seems as if many of Carolyn's anecdotes, such as having to wear dresses to school that aren't mentioned as part of a uniform or not being able to run her own paper route, are problems not usually faced by girls today.<br />Carolyn herself is smart and fairly likable, but not as inspiring as van Draanen's other major girl hero, Sammy Keyes.<br />  --- Reviewed by Carlie Kraft Webber	2004-07-01

It isn't often that we are lucky enough to learn about a man who had the curiosity of a child and the mind of a genius, who loved learning and was able to find humor in all types of situations. Benjamin Franklin was such a man.<br />Candace Fleming allows us to explore Franklin's extraordinary life in a new way. She has chosen to present Franklin's life in the form of a scrapbook or almanac, rather than a traditional biography. Franklin in fact gained a good portion of his original popularity by publishing an almanac himself titled POOR RICHARD'S ALMANAC. It is perhaps only fitting that his life be presented in the form of an almanac as well.<br />It is quite astonishing to discover within the pages of this remarkable book how much Franklin accomplished in his lifetime. In addition to his electrical experiments involving kites, Franklin organized the first real postal system in the thirteen colonies, printed the first paper money, and saw years before anyone else that the American Revolution was going to happen. He also recognized that slavery would be an issue that would not go away; he knew that one day it would be a problem for the people of the United States.<br />One of the wonderful things about this book is that you can pick it up and dip into the pages at random --- and once you pick it up, you cannot put it down. Resembling an almanac or scrapbook with an old-fashioned looking script, pictures, photographs, copies of letters and other documents, BEN FRANKLIN'S ALMANAC is a refreshing new look at the life of one of America's greatest men. We are able to marvel and sometimes smile at the things Benjamin Franklin did and said.

From accessorizing their sisters' drinks with bugs to hiding the fact that the family goldfish won't survive no matter what Joey does, they never run out of adventures.<br />All of their mishaps have one thing in common: Rusty always swears that he'll never breathe a word about anything that goes wrong, no matter how much it might hurt other people or how much it eats him inside. But when a tragic accident occurs, Rusty realizes that friendship, loyalty and secrecy are not always bound together, and that telling what appears to be a harmful secret might sometimes be beneficial in the end.<br />Wendelin van Draanen, author of the SAMMY KEYES mysteries, tries her hand at a new voice here --- that of a Southern boy. While the voice feels authentic, the plot tends to lag until the predictable end, where it rushes through some of the most emotionally important aspects of the story.

Lucy likes to have friends about her, someone to do cartwheels with and the like. The problem is that in France, the other little girls speak French. So, she rationalizes, she cannot have a friend. However, this does not stop her from finding friends for her brother and father. With simplicity that is so refreshing in the very young, Lucy cuts through all the nonsense that older people seem to build around themselves and quietly but firmly sets up her father and brother with two charming people.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt was born into a life of comfort --- one could almost say a life of luxury. He had a beautiful home, was tutored privately, had a pony to ride and a boat to sail, and went on European vacations. His mother had very definite ideas as to how she wanted her son to live his life, and her word was very much the law in the Roosevelt household. Franklin went to a prestigious boarding school and then on to Harvard, just as his parents wished.<br />It was only when he was in his twenties that he began to assert his independence. He decided that he wanted to marry the niece of the great \\"Teddy\\" Roosevelt, a relative and former President of the United States. \\"Mother\\" was not pleased with his choice but Franklin insisted.<br />Franklin had just begun his political career when he was struck down and crippled by polio. His mother wanted him to go to the family home where she could care for him. But Franklin was not going to let polio destroy his dreams, and he fought very hard to prove to the American public that he was strong enough to be a good candidate --- first for Governor of New York, and later for President of the United States. He was determined to show them that a person stricken with polio could still be a great leader; he was so successful in this mission that he was elected President for an unprecedented four terms. He helped pull the United States out of the dark years of the Depression and led the country through World War II. With a huge grin on his face, he cheered up the American public when few others could.<br />In addition to documenting his remarkable accomplishments as a leader, author Kathleen Kudlinski also touches on Franklin's private life. We learn that he was afraid of fire because he couldn't run from it, he exercised for hours so that he would be able to do what was required of him as President, and though his leg braces hurt him terribly, he never said a word or complained. Franklin founded the March of Dimes and his support helped hundreds of polio victims. By the end of his third term in office, Franklin grew tired and terribly ill, but he still chose to run for President again because his country needed him.<br />Kudlinski brings Franklin Delano Roosevelt to life, giving him a real face, heart and smile.<br />   --- Reviewed by Marya Jansen-Gruber (mjansengruber@mindspring.com)	2004-07-01

Jerry Spinelli's novel, LOSER, details the childhood of Donald Zinkoff, focusing on his life from the first through sixth grades. Most readers will relate to either knowing or being a Donald Zinkoff at some point in their lives. Zinkoff is usually the last person picked for athletic teams, his flute consistently hits the wrong note during concerts, and he is occasionally too eager at the wrong times.<br />First grade is when Zinkoff is introduced to school. He loves it, even though he is always seated in the rear of the classroom because his teacher sits students alphabetically. But Zinkoff hits his low point in fifth grade, when his team does not want him to participate in that year's field day because of his horrible performance during last year's proceedings.<br />Sixth grade is Zinkoff's first year of Middle School, where he reconnects with his former neighbor from second grade, Andrew. Andrew has changed his identity to become \\"Drew\\", a sixth grader who has confidence in the crowded halls and a cell phone in his book bag.<br />This chance encounter sort of clues Zinkoff in as to how much of a difference there is between him and his peers. Even though they consider him to be a loser, he's not; in fact, Zinkoff has a heart of gold. This is shown through his interactions with his parents and the lonely, elderly lady in his neighborhood, as well as the hours he spends looking for a little girl from his neighborhood who becomes lost in a snowstorm.<br />Readers will like Zinkoff and enjoy how much pleasure he receives from the simplest of activities, from spending the day with his dad pretending to deliver mail, to biking all over his neighborhood and checking on the waiting man. After seeing Zinkoff's consistently positive attitude and the level at which he tries, readers will want Zinkoff to become part of the in-crowd among his peers. While this does not happen, the book ends on an optimistic note, which seems fitting for Zinkoff's positive philosophy on life. LOSER may inspire readers to be a little more understanding towards the \\"Zinkoffs\\" in their lives.<br />   ---(...)	2004-07-01

I've never lived by the sea or been a fisherman, but Rodman Philbrick makes me feel the ocean spray in my face with his vivid descriptions of Skiff Beaman's adventures in Spinney Cove. The story of Skiff's memorable summer is told in the straightforward, humorous voice of Skiff himself.<br />Skiff Beaman is angry at the world, and he has good reason. After his mother dies, his father won't get off the couch or stop feeling sorry for himself. Skiff thinks that his dad will come to life when he tells him that their fishing boat, the Mary Rose, sank. But nothing short of a miracle will get his dad off the couch and out of the house.<br />With the help of the local fishermen, including old Mr. Woodwell, Skiff learns how he can raise the Mary Rose all by himself. The boat is badly damaged and repairs will be quite expensive. Skiff comes up with a plan to make money, but obstacles soon get in his way, his biggest one being Tyler Croft, the town bully. Tyler has it out for Skiff just because he's a swamper and therefore sabotages Skiff's moneymaking plans. But then Skiff gets a really \\"big\\" idea. If he isn't careful, though, this idea could cost him his life.<br />Skiff's determination is contagious, and I found myself rooting for him all the way, right up until the end of the story. If you want to find out if he can beat the odds and keep a promise he made to his mother, then you must read THE YOUNG MAN AND THE SEA.<br />   --- Reviewed by Renee Kirchner (...)	2004-06-17

Jack is a yellow Labrador retriever who has many adventures. He lives with his Packleader, Tom; his Pack Lady, Charlie; and their children, Terri, Pete and Mikey. Jack often likes to talk about his adventures, which include interpretive footnotes from the three cats that live with him. The cats' names are Remy, Maisie and Muskie. They call Jack \\"The Big Yellow Stupid\\" for reasons that are not always clear.<br />Jack's pack has new neighbors who move in next door. He's very excited to meet their girl dog, a pretty Samoyed named Petra. Petra is also excited to meet Jack, but her Pack Lady, Letitia, is not. Letitia's dislike for Jack creates a problem for Jack and Petra's new friendship; nevertheless, Jack soon finds himself thinking about Petra a lot.<br />Some time later, Jack is taken for Walkies to an old flour mill where his Packleader snaps pictures for a newspaper article about how important the mill is and why it shouldn't be torn down. Meanwhile, Jack decides to go for a swim in the pond around the mill, but has to be rescued by his Packleader when the pond proves too much for him. The next day, Tom stays in bed because of a cold, leaving Jack and his apepuppy friends, Pete and Mikey, to get into mischief. Jack is able to get through the neighbors' fence with Pete and Mikey's help; a romance soon develops between he and Petra, and they marry.<br />Unfortunately, our two lovebirds get into deep trouble when Jack's Pack Lady finds them scavenging for food. They decide to run off to the old mill; once there, Petra has Special Messages (puppies) and it is up to Jack to provide for them and keep them safe. But the pressure is on for Jack when his Packleader comes looking for him and ends up in an accident --- not to mention the unfriendly apedogs that seem to be visiting the mill at different times. Will Jack be able to save the day once again?<br />I think this is a good story for fans of Jack. New readers of Jack's adventures, like myself, may find it a little difficult to understand at first. Once you read the Jackspeak English glossary in the back of the book, though, the story becomes easier to understand.

There is no doubt that Houdini is a most unusual creature, for this is a hamster with an advanced vocabulary and a terribly immodest opinion of his own superior brain power. Houdini believes without question that hamsters are a higher form of life than humans. He is, however, a kindhearted creature (generally speaking) and tolerates the bumbling ways of humans well enough.<br />What is hard for him to tolerate is their tendency to want to lock him up in a cage. If there is anything Houdini does not like, it is to be locked up. It is in fact his amazing ability to escape his cage that got him his name. Houdini is an escapologist of the very highest order.<br />Houdini also tends to reap chaos in his wake, which makes him most unpopular with the father of the boys who own him. Father becomes enraged when Houdini first chews electrical wire, carpeting and a door, and then finally causes a flood in the kitchen. It is all too much. Even Houdini has to admit that Father has just cause to be upset. So Houdini decides to stay with a friend for a while, until Father has time to cool off. Ben has a hamster called Oggi, a female who humiliates Houdini dreadfully. Houdini is soon on the loose and makes the most amazing discovery --- he finds himself in the great Outside.<br />Never in his wildest dreams did Houdini imagine that the great Outside would be so wonderful. What he comes to learn is that Outside is also terribly dangerous and unpredictable. In fact, he could very easily become someone's lunch or dinner out there.<br />In this funny yet thoughtful book, Lynne Reid Banks takes us into the mind, and heart, of a brilliant and delightful character who has flaws just like the rest of us. What is endearing about Houdini is that he is willing to admit his imperfections and mistakes. Using rich and complex language, the author never talks down to her readers but expects them to know what she means and understand what her wonderful, often grandiose hamster is saying. We cannothelp but grow fond of this ambitious rodent, who discovers that there is a power far greater than even his own will to escape from every cage he is put into.<br />   --- Reviewed by Marya Jansen-Gruber (mjansengruber@mindspring.com) of Through The Looking Glass Book Review ([...]	2004-06-17

THE OUTCASTS OF 19 SCHUYLER PLACE is the follow-up to SILENT TO THE BONE by two-time Newbery Medal-winning author E.L. Konigsburg. Margaret Rose Kane tells the story of the summer when she was twelve, the same year that Sally Ride became the first American woman in space and Cabbage Patch dolls were popular toys.<br />Margaret is sent to summer camp while her parents travel in Peru. Shunned by the other campers, she decides to stop participating in camp activities. When asked why she won't participate, she quotes Herman Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener, \\"I prefer not to.\\" It is her uncles who must come to her rescue while her parents are away.<br />Margaret expects to have an idyllic summer with her uncles. She looks forward to helping them with the three scrap metal towers they have spent the past 45 years building in their backyard. It is only by chance that she discovers what her parents and her uncles have been hiding from her: the towers are scheduled for demolition.<br />Gathering a disparate group of adults who have an interest in the towers, Margaret organizes a campaign to save the towers and learns about the history of the neighborhood her uncles have inhabited throughout the years. While the outcome is not exactly what readers might expect, Konigsburg explores the dynamics and consequences of civil disobedience, and what happens when a girl decides to start participating in life again.<br />A summer crush and a well-planned revenge are the book's major highlights. THE OUTCASTS OF 19 SCHUYLER PLACE may not have the same whimsy as THE MIXED-UP FILES OF MRS. BASIL E. FRANKWEILER or the spirited competition of THE VIEW FROM SATURDAY, but it does share a theme common in all of Konigsburg's books: the self-reliance and resilience of young people facing the difficult task of becoming adults.<br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah A.

Because of a rare condition called xeroderma pigmentosum, sunshine and some artificial light have always been eight-year-old Lila's enemy. Sunlight burns her skin and can even cause her to go blind, so Lila lives in darkened rooms and is involved in many nighttime adventures. She sleeps during the day and attends school in her own dim kitchen. She waits each evening for sunset and darkness, when she can go outside to play and explore her neighborhood. Even at night, she must slather herself with sunscreen, wear sunglasses and cover up.<br />Lila doesn't lack for companions. Monk, Lila's older sister, calls the family \\"shadow people and proud of it.\\" Monk is Lila's co-adventurer, bundling her sister up at night to take her to coffee houses and on rides. After dark, Lila's dad accompanies her to the grocery store where they race shopping carts in the parking lot. David, a neighbor boy, brings Lila comic books and comradeship. Reading the comic books makes her want to be a super hero called the sun goddess/moon girl.<br />Lila's friends, Elizabeth and Alyssa, visit her only at night; somehow no one else has met them or even seen them. Her mysterious nocturnal visitors secretly plot with Lila to find a way for her to enjoy sunlight. In fact, they promise to help fill her sun bag. When it's filled, Lila will no longer have to live only in darkness. She can't wait until she's able to go outside during the day and dance in sunshine as a true sun goddess/moon girl.<br />As time goes by and her ninth birthday approaches, Lila begins to wonder why no one has seen Alyssa and Elizabeth --- even when she points them out. She also puzzles over the sun bag --- how can filling it with sun pieces \\"fix\\" her?<br />This is an intriguing, unusual story told in a graceful, childlike voice.

She had taken care of him since his mother died and they were close friends. Still, he was now almost grown up and ready for a change.<br />What Ben wasn't ready for was the work itself. It was grueling. He had to labor such long hours and his father was a hard taskmaster with exacting rules that must never be broken. After a sticky accident involving a lot of spilled molasses, Ben's father fired the other cook's helper or \\"cookee\\" who worked in the camp. So now it was just Ben and his father who had to feed the always hungry lumberjacks three times a day, seven days a week.

When Joan learned to read, she read like crazy! In her book she says, \\"From a very early age I understood that words could be put together in a wonderful way, then written down and kept forever.\\"<br />Before Joan was old enough to write, she dictated poetry to her mother, who then wrote those poems down for her. Later, she filled journals with poetry, stories, greeting card verses, descriptions and thoughts. At age ten, a magazine published one of her poems --- and when she saw her poetry in print, she knew she had to publish more of her writing.<br />There was no television set or computer in Joan's house. The children played games and listened to radio shows. One of Joan's favorite radio programs was called \\"I Love a Mystery.\\" The show's suspenseful stories were complete with creepy sound effects. Joan loved those tales, which led to her discovery of mystery books at the library. She swore she would become a mystery writer one day.<br />Joan began making up \\"what if\\" stories at a young age. She would ask herself, \\"WHAT IF this person was actually a prince? . . .WHAT IF he was a troll?\\" In her book she says, \\"What ifsare the keys that unlock the door to imagination.\\" Joan acted out her made-up stories with dolls and puppets for her neighborhood's children. She quickly learned to catch her restless audience's attention by starting each tale with action and suspense.<br />Throughout THE MAKING OF A WRITER we learn the ingredients for a terrific story.

Clarice knows that proving his innocence would also prove that she has learned to solve mysteries like Ruby Redfort. That would show that she has learned something important from the books.

As in the fifteen books preceding, LOAMHEDGE is full of mystery, adventure, romance, tragedy, and a myriad of characters we care about. In this book we are introduced to the wheelchair-bound hare named Martha Braebuck. More than anything, Martha would love to walk again, and this possibility comes to her through a vision/dream in which Martin the Warrior gives her some hints concerning the old abbey. If she can uncover these secrets, Martha should be able to lead a normal life.<br />When she shares her vision with other folks at the Abbey, they all work together to turn this miracle into a reality. This \\"quest\\" is helped along by the zany and loving characters of Braggon the otter and Sarobando the squirrel, best friends and former pranksters of the abbey who have been on their own world adventures and are ready and willing for yet another.<br />As always there are many layers to these stories, as interesting little characters weave in and out, creating subplots and more adventures. They include Martha's mischievous brother Horty --- who runs off with Sarobando and Braggon to help his sister, the evil searat Raga Bol (who holds the abbey under siege) --- and of course, all the fun \\"Redwallers\\" who are part of the colorful tapestry of the Redwall series.<br />Jacques's ability to create these wonderful personalities, evil and good, from animals is the height of skilled anthropomorphic writing. He has a huge following with a web site that is visited by many fans around the world ([...] Outstanding artists lend these books an even greater depth --- all the covers are beautifully done, including this one with Troy Howell's beautiful painting. Charming ink drawings by David Elliot introduce each chapter and are also often featured on the web site.<br />Even if you have never read any books in this series before, you will still enjoy this latest addition to Redwall.<br />   --- Reviewed by Sally M.

Sure, it's neat to live right in San Francisco Bay, but the neighbors leave something to be desired. You see, Moose and his family live on Alcatraz Island, where Moose's father has a new job as electrician and prison guard. At school on the mainland, Moose is a bit of a misfit. Not only do the other guys think living on Alcatraz is a little weird, they also don't understand why Moose can't stay after school to play baseball.<br />Instead, Moose has to head home to watch his sister Natalie. Natalie has autism, a condition that had not even been identified in 1935, when this novel is set. No one is quite sure how to deal with Natalie. Most \\"experts\\" tell the Flannagans to put her in an institution, but the family would rather try a variety of experimental therapies, which yield mostly disappointing results. Moose is the only one who can really reach Natalie, and he constantly clashes with his mother about the best way to work with her.<br />Moose and Natalie discover a new kind of community among the several families who live on Alcatraz Island, including bossy seven-year-old Theresa and the warden's manipulative, sneaky (but also kind of cute) daughter Piper. In the end, the kids cooperate --- with a little help from Al Capone himself --- to find a place where Natalie can finally belong.<br />Believe it or not, this novel's unusual setting is based on fact --- the families of Alcatraz prison guards actually did live on the island. The author includes a helpful note explaining the historical facts behind the story, as well as a brief note about autism.<br />What really makes this a winning novel, though, is not the setting but its main character. Moose, who narrates the story, is responsible and trustworthy in spite of himself. The love he feels for his sister despite the frustrations she causes him shines through all his words. The relationships among Moose, his hardworking father and his well-meaning mother are also rich and dynamic. Even without its connection to the famous mobster, AL CAPONE DOES MY SHIRTS would still be a real hit.<br />   (...)	2004-05-18

He has cured the Sleepy Plague by releasing a Nightsweeper and now is ready for some well-deserved rest. What else could he be needed for? Plenty, it seems, when the Will calls upon Arthur's assistance early Tuesday morning.<br />Arthur is told that Grim Tuesday has found a loophole in the Agreement and has laid claim to the Lower House and the First Key as payment for debts owed by Mister Monday over the last thousand years. The Will tells Arthur that he must come to the House and stop Grim Tuesday before he takes over Arthur's newly acquired position and the world. Arthur is furious at having to enter the realms of the House again so soon and is baffled when the connection to the red old-fashioned telephone the Will gave him is cut off because his credit is being revoked by the Court of the Days. He then observes two Grotesques of Grim Tuesday putting up a magical SOLD sign outside his family's home. Arthur learns that he must get to the House by noon before his life in the Secondary Realm is ruined.<br />Arthur discovers that getting into the House will not be easy this time around. While looking for a visible entrance, he notices some sort of Nithling lurking in a garden across the street. Arthur is wary of the thing and decides to look it up in the Atlas. He reads that the strange creature is not just any Nithling but a Scoucher that soon chases Arthur and tries to attack him with its deadly tentacles. Arthur hears his friend Leaf call his name and hides in her house when she notices the Scoucher following him.<br />The two friends hide in the garage while they try to find some silver to vanquish the creature. They are able to defeat the Scoucher with a medal but not before Leaf is seriously injured. As Arthur applies first-aid, Leaf tells him how to get into the House through a dream she has. Arthur is worried about Leaf's condition but she convinces him to leave,knowing that help is on the way. With only minutes to spare, Arthur heads over to the old mill that Leaf described.<br />Once inside the mill, Arthur sees that a Grotesque is up to no good and has to fight him in order to get inside the House. He manages to do so and notices that much has changed since the last time he was there. The Lieutenant Keeper of the Front Door helps prevent the boy from having an asthma attack and tells him that he must go to The Far Reaches in order to reach Grim Tuesday's domain. Arthur doesn't want to go, but the Lieutenant is persistent and helps disguise the boy as an indentured Denizen. All indentured Denizens work in the terrifying place called the Pit.<br />On the journey towards the Pit, Arthur meets a Denizen named Japeth, who tells him about the life of indentured Denizens and the system they work in. Arthur becomes anxious at the thought of having to work alongside Grim Tuesday's train as an indentured servant. He grows tired and Japeth stays behind to help him as the rest of their group continues traveling to the Pit. Arthur's friend Suzy Turquoise Blue shows up along the railway in a stolen wheel contraption. Suzy informs her friend that they have to use ascension wings to get out of the pit and climb across the ceiling of the Far Reaches in order to get to the spire of Grim Tuesday's Treasure Tower and find Part Two of the Will.<br />Suzy and Arthur arrive at the Tower but not without some frightening encounters involving Nothing and a meeting with one of Grim Tuesday's eyebrows named Soot, who only wants to get to Tuesday's treasure. The friends are wary of him, but with Soot's assistance they get into the Tower.

After all, how many kids have parents who encourage them to swing from the dining room chandeliers or eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with their feet?<br />Evangeline's parents, Merriweather and Magdelana Mudd, are not your typical mother and father. The Mudds are primatologists --- people who study apes and monkeys --- and their specialty is the golden-haired apes of the Ikkinasti Jungle. The Mudds are impressed by the fun-loving and harmonious way of life the golden-haired apes follow and decide to raise their own daughter Evangeline the same way --- with a few exceptions like playing the piano.<br />The Mudds are as happy as can be living in their New England bungalow until a phone call from Dr. Aphrodite Pikkaflee changes everything.

A new family of golden-haired apes was discovered in the Ikkinasti Jungle and the Mudds are needed to observe them for two weeks --- without Evangeline.<br />The Ikkinasti Jungle is a dangerous place to bring a nine-year-old like Evangeline. There are wormy things that crawl between your toes and enter directly into your bloodstream. There are mosquitoes the size of hummingbirds. And worst of all, there are giant spitting spiders whose spit can blind you!<br />Instead of exploring the Ikkinasti Jungle with her parents, Evangeline has to stay with her father's awful third cousin twice removed and his ex-ballerina wife.

Nothing strange has happened to the Grace children, and their uncle's \\"Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You\\" is still missing. Perhaps the attacks on them by the creatures of the Faerie world have stopped for good. In fact, things have been so quiet that it almost seems as if none of their previous adventures happened at all. Except of course that they have a griffin in their garage still recuperating from an encounter with some goblins.<br />Then the nightmare begins, and it is so strange that Jared wonders if he's losing his mind. While the fencing duels are taking place, Jared observes a boy rummaging through Mallory's bag. On closer inspection he sees that the boy looks like Simon and yet \\"his\\" Simon is still sitting in the stands with their mother watching the fencing. Are there now two Simons?<br />Jared goes to investigate and comes face-to-face not with a copy of Simon but with a copy of himself. And yet this duplicate is malevolent and clearly something from the Faerie world. Jared pulls out his knife in self-defense --- just as the Principal arrives. The Faerie creature, or shape-shifter, has in the meantime changed into a sorry looking little boy with blond hair. Now, all that the Principal sees is Jared threatening a terrified child. Jared is in the soup again and this time he knows he is in real trouble.<br />Then, to add to this already unpleasant situation, the twins discover that Mallory is missing. Clues that they find and an ominous message written on a rock that says \\"TRADE\\" make it clear that Mallory has been abducted by the Faerie creatures and that they will have to trade the Guide for Mallory in order to get her back. There is a problem, however: the Grace twins don't have the guide anymore.<br />The boys remember that the map they found sometime ago said that dwarves lived in the quarry that lies near the Spiderwick Estate. They are sure that the rock with the message on it was from the quarry as well. Clearly this is where they have to go to find Mallory. What follows is a frightening and remarkable adventure in the world of the dwarves, under the ground and far from the reassuring light of day.<br />Once again Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black have produced a gripping, somewhat scary, story in their series about Mallory, Jared and Simon Grace. Wonderfully paced, and with new insights into the character of Jared, THE IRONWOOD TREE is hard to put down once one has begun to read it. At the end we are left hanging and with a definite understanding of what the Faerie creatures want. Unfortunately for the Grace children, this desire sounds decidedly unpleasant.<br /> (...)	2004-05-18

Eleven-year-old Noi also longs to be an artist, and when her grandmother lets Noi add small designs to the umbrella, she seems to have natural talent: \\"The flit of the butterflies moved into her, then out into the brush, so the paint seemed to lay itself down.\\"<br />When Noi's family falls on hard times, though, and Noi's older sister Ting is sent to work making radios at the factory, Noi fears that she, too, will be sent to work when she finishes school in just a few months. When Noi sees the stifling environment of the factory, she grows even more desperate to avoid this fate and asks her grandmother to help her learn how to paint. In secret, Noi creates dozens of decorated umbrellas, inspired by the flora, fauna and colors of the landscape. When her grandmother grows ill, will Noi be able to paint umbrellas beautiful enough to help support her family?<br />Set against the background of preparations for the harvest festival of Loy Krathong, SILK UMBRELLAS is not only the story of the birth of an artist, but also a loving portrayal of Thai nature and culture. Careful readers will notice subtle commentaries on the changing economic conditions in Thailand. Electronics factories replace traditional crafts; Noi's father weaves fishing baskets, not for fishermen but for Western tourists.<br />SILK UMBRELLAS is a slim novel that can nevertheless be read on several levels. Younger readers will enjoy witnessing Noi's artistic development and learning about Thai customs, and older readers will also grasp the larger cultural commentary in Carolyn Marsden's sensitively written novel.<br />   ---(...)	2004-05-18

Sometimes her friend Max joins her. Max runs to escape from small town life, but Annie runs for its own sake. Running is the place where she can set her own pace and think about all the changes that are occurring in her life. Her mother is pregnant, her grandfather is forgetful and twelve-year-old Annie herself is changing, wondering:<br />\\"And what did I think/ when I was small/ and why did I forget?/ And what else will I forget/ when I grow older?/ And if you forget. Is it as if/ it never happened?/ Will none of the things/ you saw or thought or dreamed/ matter?\\"<br />HEARTBEAT is the latest book by Newbery Award-winning author Sharon Creech. Written in the same prosy free verse as her popular book LOVE THAT DOG, HEARTBEAT focuses less on poetic form and more on exploring Annie's different emotional states. Creech's poems are snapshots of Annie's feelings and experiences, an effective way of telling a story in short hand. But the impressions of the poems are fleeting, as Creech uses repetitive superlatives and abstract language rather than building images of Annie's world.<br />The most vivid images in the book are descriptions of color: the changing colors of the seasons around Annie as she runs, the changing color of an apple Annie is assigned to draw 100 times for art class, and the colors in the room where her mother gives birth to her new baby brother. These colors create a kaleidoscopic effect. Like Annie's moods, the colors in her world are always changing, making them both difficult to pinpoint.<br />Poetry is becoming a popular form for children's literature. HEARTBEAT does not have the same intensity as Karen Hesse's Newbery Award-winning book OUT OF THE DUST, but it does mark a new direction for Creech. It is a more mature book than LOVE THAT DOG, and Creech's descriptions of ordinary feelings in an ordinary life are a worthy subject for poetry. Readers accustomed to the transcontinental adventures of her previous books, which include WALK TWO MOONS, BLOOMABILITY and THE WANDERER, will have a chance to encounter another unexplored region: the inner workings of a twelve-year-old girl's mind.<br />(...)	2004-05-18

Now, it's up to Darren Shan, his mentor Larten Crepsley and a Vampire Prince named Vancha March to find the Vampaneze Lord and kill him before he brings about the destruction of all vampires.<br />Mr. Tiny tells them that they have five chances to rid themselves of the Vampaneze Lord. One passed when the vampires executed one of their Princes, Kurdha Smahlt, for being a traitor. While Mr. Tiny refuses to tell Darren and Mr. Crepsley what the four remaining chances are, he does tell them to \\"follow their hearts.\\" Following their hearts takes them to the Cirque du Freak by way of the dwelling of sorceress Lady Evanna, who makes a very disturbing prophecy about Darren himself!<br />While Shan never skimps on adventure or suspense, Darren's voice is stronger and more mature here than it has been in the past.

Shan leaves us in the end with many questions about Darren's future and the war between the vampires and vampaneze, promising an intriguing eighth book.<br />  --- Reviewed by Carlie Webber	2004-05-17

He is going to a new preparatory school, leaving his old friends and the village school behind. He suspects his father may be sick. The Cuban Missile Crisis is raging in America, threatening the entire world with nuclear annihilation.<br />He is also meeting new people. There is McNulty, a fire-eater and escapologist whose mind was unhinged in WWII. There is Daniel, the new kid in town, who looks down on Keely Bay's working class inhabitants. Then there are the cruel teachers at Bobby's new school, who resort to beatings when they feel children don't know their place.<br />Together, Bobby and Daniel mount a protest against the barbaric practice of strapping. The potential price of expulsion seems insignificant compared to the protests against nuclear war they see on television. When Bobby asks his father about the rioting, he answers, \\"That's just people doing what they should do, making their voice heard, yelling against what they know is wrong.\\"<br />David Almond's books often deal with themes of faith and redemption. THE FIRE-EATERS contains both of these elements, along with a reverence for even the most damaged lives. The night when nuclear war is averted, Bobby, his family, McNulty and the neighbors gather on the beach, eating, drinking and trying to spend time together with the people and places they love before the world ends, or changes forever.<br />THE FIRE-EATERS contains a powerful message of hope. The fear of nuclear war, which was at its height during the Cuban Missile Crisis, was for its generation what the fear of terrorism is for this generation. Not every disaster can be averted, as was seen during the tragic events of September 11th, but the FIRE-EATERS is a reminder that these moments of crisis can bring clarity to our lives and help us to treasure those things that are truly meaningful.<br />   --- Reviewedby Sarah A.

A paper origami butterfly stained with blood is their only lead.<br />Judge Ooka and Seikei begin to ask servants and villagers about the night of the murder. They all insist that they saw nothing and weren't involved. Then they ride to a guard's palace and capture Tinsuno, a ninja, and talk with him about the murder. The judge then asks Tinsuno to go with Seikei to see a papermaker named Bakkoro in Minnowa about the butterfly. Tinsuno agrees, and the journey begins.<br />When they get to Minnowa to see Bakkoro, they find out that the paper was made for the O-Miwa shrine at the base of Miwayama and that the shrine is forbidden; it has no shelter for the Kami to reside in because he lives on a sacred mountain. They next go to Etchu Providence to question Lord Inaba's enemies.<br />Upon their arrival, they find out that Lord Inaba had many foes. He murdered children and ordered farmers to pay full taxes on their crops, causing families to starve.

He escapes and goes to the governor's house alone.<br />While at the governor's house, Seikei and his father talk with the Kannushi about the murder. The Kannushi asks Seikei to perform one very dangerous task: to climb on Miwayama Mountain and confront the ninja who they believe committed the murder.

With CHU JU'S HOUSE, Whelan applies her same eye for detail to modern China, in the story of a young woman who must travel far away to find the self-respect she'll never gain at home.(...)<br />As Chu Ju travels throughout rural China, readers will learn about many traditional Chinese occupations: fishing, silk making and rice farming. Because of its focus on rural life and traditional work, the novel sometimes seems to be set in the distant past. But occasional references to city life (including a harrowing journey to Shanghai) and recent events such as the Tiananmen Square tragedy remind readers that this novel is indeed set in modern times.<br />CHU JU'S HOUSE touches on political issues in modern China, and it would be an excellent jumping-off point for discussions about politics, culture and gender roles. It's also an entertaining adventure story. Although the book is short, it covers several years in Chu Ju's life. Readers will enjoy watching this headstrong, idealistic girl grow into a strong-willed, responsible young woman.<br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl	2004-05-17

But as they enter sixth grade, their friendship changes. Kate continues to love reading, basketball and bugs, while Marylin dreams of kissing, boys and cheerleading. The friends periodically drift apart and then are pulled back together throughout THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF GIRLS.<br />As the girls hover between childhood and womanhood, and between being buddies and just acquaintances, their bond is tried again and again. Flannery, \\"the queen of eyeball rolling,\\" moves into their neighborhood, wooing Marylin with her siren song of seventh grade sophistication. Marylin, who is working on a \\"whole new me,\\" has changed her name's spelling (it used to be \\"Marilyn\\") and is wondering if her weird toes would improve with plastic surgery --- or, at least, a coat of nail polish. She goes out for cheerleading and starts hanging with the popular crowd. Kate, who does not yearn for romance, finds herself \\"in like\\" with a fellow basketball player.<br />Each chapter in this book is a perfect little story with the power to make the reader giggle or choke up. Early on, when Marylin and Kate rescue an orphaned baby bird, Marylin thinks Kate is \\"back in first-grader land.\\" Feeling compelled to motivate her friend to grow up, Marylin tries to educate Kate on the probability of the bird's death. She worries that Kate will be devastated when the bird succumbs. During the inevitable funeral, though, Marylin finds herself moved by the little bird's demise and afterward Kate amazes her by requesting toenail-painting lessons.<br />In another story, Kate learns an amazing lesson on how to connect with others, taught by a free-spirited new girl at school. In yet another, Marylin has a sleepover that goes bad from the start --- until it's redeemed by a flock of snow-angels.<br />This is a satisfying read with tremendous heart. I wholeheartedly recommend THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF GIRLS to any female who has a best friend, had a best friend, or wants a best friend. I do have just one question: How old is the author, Frances O'Roark Dowell? She knows sixth grade girls so eerily well, I swear she can't be much over twelve.<br />   --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (...)	2004-05-17
