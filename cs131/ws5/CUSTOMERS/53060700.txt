Wavelet theory is one of the newest branches of mathematics, originally  emerged from the broader harmonic analysis, but now making its own way  because of its multiple applications.<br />There are several possible  approaches to the subject, but maybe this one is both the easiest and the  best one. Modern analysis relies more and more on operator theory (linear  algebra in infinite-dimensional spaces) so this approach fits nicely in the  overall framework of modern mathematics.<br />This kind of introductory  expositions are essential for a subject to get widespread, and this one  really deserves full attention because by using these kind of techniques we  are now able to solve better a lot of problems involving pulses, signals,  oscillations, etc. Right, this is achieved normally using Fourier methods,  but mathematics has improved a lot since the times of Fourier, and now we  know that classical Fourier analysis is not always suitable for our  particular needs. Wavelet analysis provides a means for constructing a  specific Fourier-like method to solve our problem according to its  intrinsic nature.<br />Contents: Prologue: Compression of the FBI Fingerprint  Files; Background: Complex Numbers and Linear Algebra; The Discrete Fourier  Transform; Wavelets on Z_N; Wavelets on Z; Wavelets on R; Wavelets and  Differential Equations.<br />Originally intended for undergrads, but useful as  a more advanced reference. Includes full explanations and lots of  excercises. Extensive bibliography. Nice hardbound (as usual in Springer).	2000-08-04

I really expected more from such a title and such an author (group of authors as a matter of fact). The book does not cover the history of all important branches of modern mathematics, and those included are not  treated in a complete manner. Their major lacks occur in 20th century  mathematics. There's a lot of topics and names missing, for example:  algebraic geometry, coding theory, dynamical systems, harmonic analysis,  complex analysis, multidimensional complex analysis, hypercomplex analysis,  approximation theory,... ; Samuel Eilenberg, Norman Steenrod, Salomon  Lefschetz, Elias Stein, Alberto Calder√≥n, Peter Lax, Abraham Besicovitch,  Michael Atiyah, Wendell Fleming, Witold Hurewicz...<br />Eventhough the  Bourbaki group has made a great effort to synthesize and standarize a lot  of branches of modern mathematics the actual product of their work (the  Elements of Mathematics, the Fascicules of Results, etc.) may well become  obsolete and forgotten because of their limited perspective. Nevertheless,  the book contains some useful data that will prove valuable to those  interested in mathematics' history, above all, the first essay on the  foundations of mathematics.<br />Contents: Foundations of Mathematics, Logic,  Set Theory; Notation, Combinatorial Analysis; The Evolution of Algebra;  Linear Algebra and Multilinear Algebra; Polynomials and Commutative Fields;  Divisibility, Ordered Fields; Commutative Algebra, Algebraic Number Theory;  Non-Commutative Algebra; Quadratic Forms, Elementary Geometry; Topological  Spaces; Uniform Spaces; Real Numbers; Exponentials and Logarithms;  n-Dimensional Spaces; Complex Numbers, Measurement of Angles; Metric  Spaces; Infinitesimal Calculus; Asymptotic Expansions; The Gamma Function;  Function Spaces; Topological Vector Spaces; Integration in Locally Compact  Spaces; Haar Measure, Convolution; Integration in Non-Locally Compact  Spaces; Lie Groups and Lie Algebras; Groups Generated by Reflections; Root  Systems.<br />Extensive references (not common in Bourbaki writings); nice  softbound.	2000-07-31

This book is a good example of what can be done with the quaternionic formalism to improve some treatments of theoretical physics. However, it is not more than a formal improvement, of course taking advantadge of the  arithmetical properties of quaternions and their ability to represent space  rotations and other transformations needed in physics, for the author  misses the opportunity of using the full power of quaternions by ignoring  completely quaternionic ANALYSIS. He even says that this kind of analysis  is not useful for physics.

Judging from the publisher and the editors I expected to get a really outstanding book, but while reading it I got terribly dissapointed.<br />This book, with which the International Mathematical Union tried to emulate the  famous list of problems proposed by David Hilbert in 1900, together with  his description of the state of mathematics those days, totally fails to  survey the state of this science in the year 2000 and does even less to  present a comprehensive list of important problems in all branches of  mathematics that should be solved in the 21st century.<br />The editors - all  of them highly respected and renowned mathematicians - didn't make a strong  effort to collect the opinion of several other high-ranked colleagues;  instead they asked their buddies and pupils for contribution. I really  would like to read something about the topic from Elias Stein, Steven  Krantz, or Serge Lang, to name just a few. Also, the editors could have  done something to reach some kind of agreement among the contributors;  while some pose some problems of their own interest others claim that even  trying to imitate Hilbert is nonsense. Some dissert on the interaction  between mathematics and physics (there's even one who claims that  mathematics is a part of physics) but almost none pays attention to the  newer ineractions between mathematics and other disciplines. It seems that  they haven't realized that nowadays most of the motivation for difficult  and interesting problems comes from such areas as economics,  communications, military and computer science. Its surprising that almost  all of the contributors still think that theoretical physics is the main  supplier of mathematical problems.<br />And the worst: they didn't cover all  the branches of mathematics (true, it's a difficult task, but the AMS and  the IMU should be capable of doing that). There's nothing said about  operator theory, hypercomplex analysis, coding theory, commutative algebra,  wavelet analysis, and many other disciplines. Their major lack is applied  mathematics, I mean, probability, statistics, reliability, simulation,  operations research, etc. Most of the contributors blame Bourbaki for  having gone away from the actual sources of mathematical knowledge, but  they remain in the Bourbaki setting themselves!<br />Conclsion: better spend  your money in fine and focused reflections about mathematics and  mathematicians, like Hardy's, Polya's, Wiener's, von Neumann's, and even  Bourbaki's.	2000-07-18

Dirac operators on Riemannian manifolds are of fundamental importance in differential geometry: they occur in situations such as Hodge theory, gauge theory, and geometric quantization.<br />The book is based on a simple  principle: Dirac operators are a quantization of the theory of connections,  and the supertrace of the heat kernel of the square of a Dirac operator is  the quantization of the Chern character of the corresponding connection.  From this point of view, the index theorem for Dirac operators is a  statement about the relationship between the heat kernel of the square of a  Dirac operator and the Chern character of the associated connection. This  relationship holds at the level of differential forms and not just in  cohomology, and leads to think of index theory and heat kernels as a  quantization of Chern-Weil theory. The importance of the heat kernel is  that it interpolates between the identity operator and the projection onto  the kernel of the Dirac operator. However, the authors study the heat  kernel, and more particularly its restriction to the diagonal, in its own  right, and not only as a tool in understanding the kernel of the Dirac  operator.<br />The authors attempt to express allof their constructions in  such a way that they generalize easily to the equivariant setting, in which  a compact Lie group acts on the manifold and leaves the Dirac operator  invariant. They consider the most general type of Dirac operators,  associated to a Clifford module over a manifold, to avoid restricting to  manifolds with spin connections. They also work within Quillen's theory of  superconnections.<br />The book is not necessarily meant to be read  sequentially, and consists of four groups of chapters: (1) Chapters 1 and  7, the former giving various preliminary results in differential geometry  and the latter on equivariant differential forms; they do not depend on any  other chapters. (2) Chapters 2, 3, and 4 introduce the main ideas of the  book, andtake the reader through the main properties of Dirac operators,  culminating in the local index theorem. (3) Chapters 5, 6, and 8 are on the  equivariant index theorem, and may be read after the first four chapters,  although Chapter 7 is needed in Chapter 8. (4) Chapters 9 and 10 are on the  family index theorem, and can be read after the first four chapters, except  sections 9.4 and 10.7 which have Chapter 8 as a prerequisite.<br />The book is  intended for researchers and advanced graduate students; you need a very  strong background in differntial geometry, algebraic topology, harmonic  analysis, and hypercomplex analysis to read it. The style is definitely  French, so if you have had trouble with Bourbaki be prepared. The list of  references is adequately long. Very nice printing and binding quality.	2000-07-14

My comment refers to the third edition of this book, but I don't think the fourth could be much better.<br />First of all, this title shouldn't be included in the &quot;Graduate Texts in Mathematics&quot; series because  the material it covers is covered in introductory undergraduate courses.  Second, eventhough the author made a great effort to include as much topics  as he could, the treatment of most of them is highly old-fashioned. I mean,  he pays no attention to the most recent and elegant refinements of the  basic theory, so the student is not immediately able to understand the real  important ideas behind the subject. For example, nowadays the proof of the  Cauchy integral formula is presented as a more ar less easy corollary of  the general Stokes theorem. The Cauchy integral theorem is also obtained  easily following the same fashion. Incredibly, the author explores this  line in one appendix, but not well done, and apparently he doesn't realize  that there is the key idea.<br />Also, keeping in mind that holomorphic  functions are harmonic, most of the important results for holomorphic  functions should follow at once from the corresponding ones for harmonic  functions, but this old-fashioned texts don't take this remarkable  important feature of complex analysis into account, making the treatment  innecessarily complicated and leading the student to misunderstand both  complex and harmonic analysis. Eventhough the book includes a whole chapter  on harmonic functions, the author doesn't use their power as he  should.<br />I'm afraid there are few famous introductory texts that I would  suggest for first-timers. The best of them is Markushevitch, unfortunately  out of print.<br />There is also another serious drawback: The author pays no  attention at all to boundary value problems and therefore to the  Cauchy-type integral, maybe the most important tool of complex analysis.  The Hilbert transform is also not present.<br />If you have the opportunity  takea look at Muskhelishvili's &quot;Singular Integral Equations&quot; and  Gakhov's &quot;Boundary Value Problems&quot; and then you will understand  my point.<br />Lang's book could be used as a companion text and as a  reference for introductory courses.

Using a  modern and comprehensive language, the author exposes the most important  highlights of the theory, up to the numerical aspect, and puts the reader  in the track to current research.<br />The contents of the book are: Normed  spaces, bounded and compact operators, the Riesz theory, dual systems and  Fredholm theory, regularizations in dual systems, potential theory,  singular integral equations, Sobolev spaces, the heat equation, operator  approximations, degenerate kernel approximation, quadrature methods,  projection methods, iterative solution and stability, equations of the  first kind, Tikhonov regularization, regularization by discretization,  inverse scattering theory.<br />Includes motivation for each topic, excercises  for each chapter, and extensive references. Suitable for graduate students  and advanced undergraduates with a strong background in real and complex  analysis.<br />Please take a look to the rest of my reviews (just click on my  name above).	2000-05-23

Hypercomplex analysis is experimenting a &quot;boom&quot; nowadays, and the mathematical community waited for a long time before the first introductory text appeared. This is it.

This text includes material usually covered in mathematical physics courses, but its approach is somewhat different, and better, than most of the classics. The point is that the author felt not content with just explaining how to employ the most common mathematical methods to solve  physical problems. He, on one hand, presents full motivation from the  physical point of view, while on the other hand keeping high-level  mathematical rigor. Believe me: this is not usual in mathematical physics  books. By doing so, the author has produced a text valuable for both  physicists and mathematicians.<br />Its contents are: Hamilton's principle and  the theory of the first variation, representation of some physical  phenomena by partial differential equations, theorems related to partial  differential equations and their solutions, fourier series, self-adjoint  boundary value problems, Legendre polynomials and Bessel functions,  characterization of eigenvalues by a variational principle, spherical  harmonics, the nonhomogeneous boundary value problem.<br />Includes excercises  for most sections and references for each chapter.

This is a comprehensive introduction to one of the most complicated and difficult branches of analysis: complex analysis in several variables. The text begins at an elementary level with standard local results, followed by  a thorough discussion of the various fundamental concepts of &quot;complex  convexity&quot; related to the remarkable extension properties of  holomorphic functions in more than one variable. It then continues with a  comprehensive introduction to integral representations, and concludes with  complete proofs of substantial global results on domains of holomorphy and  on strictly pseudoconvex domains in C^n. The most important feature of the  book is the systematic inclusion of many of the developments of the last 20  years which centered around integral representations and estimates for the  Cauchy-Riemann equations.<br />Contents: Elementary local properties of  holomorphic functions, domains of holomorphy and pseudoconvexity,  differential forms and Hermitian geometry, integral representations, the  Levi problem and the solution of D-bar on strictly pseudoconvex domains,  function theory on domains of holomorphy, topics in function theory on  strictly pseudoconvex domains.<br />Includes full motivation, historical  notes, excercises for each section, and an extensive list of references.

The author accomplished the goal of presenting this broad and many-faceted subject in a thorough and comprehensive manner. Beginning from the fundamentals of ODE theory to the most sophisticated methods for solving important PDE's of mathematical physics, this series of three volumes  comprises all what a modern analyst must know about the topic and much  more.<br />The contents of volume 1 are: Basic theory of ODE;  Laplace and  wave equations; Fourier analysis, distributions, and constant-coefficient  linear PDE; Sobolev spaces; linear elliptic equations; linear evolution  equations. Appendices: Outline of functional analysis; manifolds, vector  bundles, and Lie groups.<br />Originally intended for graduate students and  working mathematicians, most of the material is suitable for advanced  undergraduate courses.

One of the most important and subtle features of mathematics is the great difference existing between linearity and non-linearity. One always tries to linearize whenever possible, because linear problems are easier to  solve, but unfortunately the world is not linear, and we have to learn how  to deal with non-linear problems.<br />This volume discusses thoroughly some  very important cases of non-linear PDE's which are important in  mathematical physics or that possess intrinsic theoretical interest.<br />The  contents are: Function space and operator theory for nonlinear analysis;  nonlinear elliptic equations; nonlinear parabolic equations; nonlinear  hyperbolic equations; Euler and Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible  fluids; Einstein's equations.<br />A little bit more advanced and speciallized  than the other two volumes, but still useful for a broad community.

It is an undeniable fact that every mathematician (at least in the American continent) has learned from this book. However, I totally disagree with those who regard it as the best calculus text available.<br />The style  of the text - light, slow, and even funny - is not what I would consider as  the most suitable for a college calculus course because it takes a lot of  precious time to read it all, and at the end the author comes up with a  &quot;surprising&quot; argument that is not different from those found  elsewhere (don't forget that calculus is a &quot;completed&quot;  discipline, so there's little hope to invent some new approach).<br />When I  was a first year student of course I loved Spivak, and read it every day,  but when I got a little bit more advanced, and later when I was a teacher,  I realized that those &quot;lovely&quot; features of this book were not  USEFUL for the student to understand better the subject.<br />Michael Spivak  is an intriguing author for me. I don't understand why he wrote this  fully-deatiled but unfocused book, and on the other hand he produced, to my  taste, the best available exposition on higher-dimensional calculus  (&quot;Calculus on Manifolds&quot;, also reviewed by myself) which was  written using a totally different style.<br />Nevertheless, the book is not  totally useless. You can easily find most of the important results stated  in a clear form, it's got a lot of excercises, and includes an extensive  list of references.<br />Classic books are frequently valuable, but they're  not always the best ones. My suggestion for a good, concise, focused, and  complete text for introductory calculus courses is Kuratowski (the finest  for me).<br />Please check my other reviews (just click on my name above).	2000-05-08

This thin book (175 pages) provides the newcomer or graduate student with an illustrated introduction to geometric measure theory: the basic ideas, terminology, and results. The author has included a few fundamental  arguments and a superficial discussion of the regularity theory, but his  goal is merely to introduce the subject and make the standard text,  &quot;Geometric Measure Theory&quot; by Federer, more accesible. This  second edition includes updated material and references, corrections, and a  new chapter on soap bubble clusters.<br />Its contents are: Measures,  Lipschitz functions and rectifiable sets, normal and rectifiable currents,  the completeness theorem, area-minimizing surfaces, the approximation  theorem, regualrity results, monotonicity and oriented tanget cones, flat  chains, varifolds, minimal sets, soap bubble clusters.<br />Includes  excercises, plenty of illustrations, and extensive references.<br />Highly  useful for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in analysis and  geometry.

If you get involved in analysis sooner or later you will have to read Elias Stein. Why? Because the core of analysis is harmonic analysis, and this man has been one of the leading experts in the field over at least 35 years, so, whatever branch of analysis you choose, Dr. Stein will be  there.<br />This thick book (695 pages) includes most of the topics in  harmonic analysis which have been researched extensively during the last 20  years. It should be taken as a complement to Stein's &quot;Singular  Integrals and Differentiability Properties of Functions&quot; (1970) and  Stein &amp; Weiss' &quot;Introduction to Fourier Analysis on Euclidean  Spaces&quot; (1971).<br />Its contents are: Real variable theory (covering  lemmas, maximal function, generalized Calder√≥n-Zygmund decomposition,  etc.), maximal functions (vector-valued max. functions, Carlesson measures,  etc.), Hardy spaces (characterization, atomic decomposition, singular  integrals, etc.), H^1 and BMO (sharp function, interpolation, etc.),  weighted inequalities (the class A_p, etc.), Fourier transform, almost  orthogonality, oscillatory integrals, maximal operators, maximal averages,  the Heisenberg group.<br />The style is concise and presents motivation for  each topic.

I should be surprised to be the first reviewer of this book, but thinking it again I see the point. Dieudonn&eacute;'s books are just being displaced by more accesible and focused texts, instead of these authoritative  Bourbaki-style treatises which are often too abstract to be useful.  Bourbaki mathematics accomplished the mission of unifying and standarizing  (more or less) the whole of mathematics, but once that was done, their work  now turns out to be useless. The point is that when we tackle a problem, be  it in pure or applied mathematics, we seldom need the high level of  abstraction used by Bourbaki authors. Moreover, what we need are specific  results to handle the details of our solututions, and Dieudonn&eacute; pays almost  no attention to them; he prefers to stay at the most general possible  setting, making his treatment perspectiveless because he misses completely  the goal of abstraction: To use its power when dealing with particular  situations. That's why no one has reviewed Dieudonn&eacute; before me: His books  are read no more.<br />Nevertheless, undergraduate and graduate students may  find it useful as a reference, but not as a course text because it presents  no motivation to the topics treated and includes only a very short  bibliography.<br />Its contents are: Set theory, real numbers, metric spaces,  normed spaces, Hilbert spaces, spaces of continuous functions, differential  calculus, analytic functions, existence theorems (for ODE's), and  elementary spectral theory.<br />&quot;Treatise on Analysis&quot; consisted  originally on this sole book.

I've read a lot of introductory and advanced books on analysis, and this one is maybe the worst. It gives no motivation at all to present the material; it's just stated there. And the selection is not the best I would  reccomend. I think mathematics teachers should stop using this book as  course text because it doesn't look in touch with modern trends in  mathematics, as nowadays teaching demands. Some features I dislike are: (1)  It does not move away from the real-variable case; (2) it remains in the  old-fashioned framework of metric spaces (we need NORMED spaces, evenmore  NORMED ALGEBRAS); (3) most excercises look very difficult not becuse they  really are so, but because the theory the book includes is not enough to  solve them all; (4) some of its constructions lack rigor and  completeness.<br />If you are a newcomer to analysis and want to get well  trained, better read first Apostol's or Bartle's introductory texts, and  then move on to really fine books like Lang's, Hewitt and Stromberg's,  Kolmogorov's, or Dieudonn√©'s.<br />Courious detail: Rudin's &quot;Real and  Abstract Analysis&quot; is a much better text.

It performs the construction of the same integration theory twice! I still wonder why. In the first part the author builds up the theory for the real-variable case, and in the second for the general Banach-space case. The first one is totally included in the second  one, so, why to do it? Perhaps to make the book thicker and more expensive?  It would be enough to point out the real-variable case as an observation  and even as an excercise. None of my teachers used it as textbook and I  have used it only as a reference, but not the most important of  them.<br />Other features I don't like are that some interesting results are  left for the reader as excercises, and that most of its notations are not  standard.

This meticulous text covers thoroughly just every topic from elementary set theory up to product measures. It develops  carefully all topics that should be included in standard analysis lectures  (set theory, topology, Lebesgue integral, Banach and Hilbert spaces,  differentiation, product measures) at such level of abstraction that the  book turns out to be suitable for introductory courses, advanced courses,  and later reference. The only one shortcoming I see is that the book  includes no bibliography.<br />Please check my other reviews at my member page  (click on my name above).	2000-04-04

This is the typical mathematics book intended for non-mathematicians. The author made a great effort to compile the most diverse examples of problems (better said MODELS of problems) that can be solved employing mostly ODE  and some PDE techniques. However, I think this kind of books fail to show  what mathematics is, and how mathematics should be used to solve problems  coming from other fields of knowledge.<br />First, the book does not cover  thoroughly the theory for the linear case, which could be carried out  without any effort up to the n-th order. Second, it does not tell  explicitly the great difference between the linear and the non-linear  cases. Third, eventhough it includes some material on systems of  differential equations, it doesn't exploit the fact that a n-th order  equation can be viewed as a n-th order system of of 1st order equations.  Fourth, everything is mixed up: in the same chapter you find elementary  concepts of linear algebra (that the student should be supposed to master),  some miscelaneous applications, and, if you are lucky, some theory on  differential equations. Fifth, it gives a wrong idea of the meaning of  solving an ACTUAL problem. The fact that we are able to give a nice  solution to a highly simplified model we have built does not mean that we  have found a practical solution to the problem we actually face up in the  real world, and moreover it does not mean that we will always succeed to  give a useful answer by employing these tools. When you try to solve a  problem that you don't know thoroughly you take the risk of building  castles in the air. I think that if you are interested in applying  mathematics you should start first by learning all the necessary theory and  then study carefully the problem you are interested in. And don't forget  the most important of all: the theoretical solution to an actual problem  must be confirmed by experimentation, something this book does not point  out.<br />To tell something positive about it let me say that you will find a  lot of challenging excercises, some of its &quot;application&quot; problems  are interesting, and if you are a teacher it will serve well as a companion  text for real treatises on differential equations like Coddington's or  Kaplan's.<br />Please check my other reviews at my member page (just click on  my name above).	2000-04-04

The  next step is the 2nd order linear equation and then the n-th order linear  equation. The most appreciated feature of this book is that the author  shows that the method (an explicit formula!) for solving the n-th order  equation is essentially the same as the 1st order one. After solving  completely the linear equation the author moves on to the non-linear case,  again up to the n-th order. The idea seems quite simple, yet no other  customary text introduces ODE's this way. All the other authors begin with  the 1st order equation mixing up the linear and the non-linear cases, and  continue their exposition following the same fashion, leading the student  to misunderstand a very subtle and important feature of analysis (and  mathematics): the great difference between linearity and non-linearity. The  way this book is written shows clearly this crucial phenomenon.<br />Another  valuable feature of this book is its complex-number approach which leads to  straightforward computation of explicit formulas for the solutions of  linear equations. Other texts give no more than the sketch of some methods  which have to be performed every single time, and most of them don't even  justify those methods rigorously.<br />Conclusion: Superb book. Excellent as a  course text.<br />Please read my other reviews at my member page (click on my  name above).	2000-04-03

Covers  more material than most of the old-fashioned classical references on the  subject.<br />A must-reading for the graduate student. Even undregrads will  find most parts acquaintable and useful.	2000-04-01

After reading many other books on the subject  now I'm sure he made a wise decision.<br />Assuming almost no strong  mathematical background, Bartle is able to build up the basic Lebesgue  integral theory introducing the fundamental abstract concepts  (sigma-algebra, measurable function, measure space, &quot;almost  everywhere&quot;, step function, etc.) in such an easy way that the student  is not only able to handle them but to UNDERSTAND them.<br />From the first  part of the book I appreciate specially chapters 6, 7, and 10, on L_p  spaces, modes of convergence, and product measures, respectively. These  chapters contain the most used results of the basic theory, and they are  stated exactly in the way one needs them, making the book very useful for  future reference.<br />I like the second part very much also, because it  stresses the importance of measure theory by itself and not only as a  requisite for integration theory. If you are interested in fractal geometry  or geometric measure theory you will find chapters 11 to 17 very  helpful.<br />Since I own this book it has never been lazy in my bookshelf.	2000-03-31

However, when one studies some problems on differential equations one needs to work with  unbounded operators.<br />This book constitutes a good starting point to get  acquainted with such operators, mostly with closed and strictly singular  ones. It includes some applications to perturbation theory and ordinary  differential equations, and gives some comments on the Dirichlet problem  for PDE's. Finally, its extensive list of references motivates you to  deeper study.	2000-03-31

The overall text of this book dates from the 1950's. When it was first published it became immediately a  best-seller, and today it continues to be so. Wonder why? It's easy. Dr.  Kolmogorov was one of the finest mathematicians ever, and moreover, he was  also recognized as an excellent teacher. So, the combination of first-line  expert and first-line lecturer produced this highly appreciated text. By  reading it you can see not only the author's capability to introduce  delicate subjects (set theory, normed spaces, linear functionals, Lebesgue  integral, Fourier integrals, etc.) but also his genius in understanding  where the trends of modern mathematics would flow. The more you read this  book the more you love it, and the more you love mathematics itself.	2000-03-29

If you have read other books by Lang you will notice that some material included in previous works appears reproduced  here word by word. Also, there are some inconsistencies in the notation of  different sections, making it obvious that different parts of the book were  written at different times, and perhaps by different persons.<br />All these  shortcomings don't mean that the book is bad. Quite the opposite: It is a  very complete survey on modern differential geometry, including from the  fundamentals up to recent results. The graduate student and the working  mathematician will find it very useful.	2000-03-28

Taking this into account you cannot expect to find a state-of-the-art exposition of the subject. However, the book is written in  a very concise and focused style, making it endurable. Its clear  introduction to many delicate topics (covariant derivatives, metric  tensors, geodesics, etc.) is still valuable even now when the differential  form approach seems to have won the battle. Also, the sections it devotes  to integral theorems look more in touch with current trends in mathematics  than most of the classical texts at this level.	2000-03-28

It covers everything from the most basic  vector space concepts up to the fundamental theorems of classical  mechanics, running through multivariate calculus, exterior calculus,  integration of forms, and many topics more, always keeping a very modern  and rigorous style.<br />The undergraduate may find it a little difficult, but  the effort is worth it.

Eventhough the book  doesn't tell anything about quaternionic analysis, it is helpful as a  reference when one has to deal with the algebraic features of these  systems.<br />I think most of the contents of the book are understandable by  second or thir year undergrads, after reading Feferman's &quot;The Number  Systems&quot;, for example.	2000-03-25

I appreciate books that remained useful through several  stages of my learning, and I cannot say Herstein's is one of them.<br />One  feature I don't like of this book is that it really doesn't move away from  the truly basic properties of the algebraic objects it studies, I mean, it  doesn't include really deep or recent results, making it a perspectiveless  book.

This book is just a collection of  formulas, EASY examples, problems, and references, and as such it is quite  good, but the indefense undergraduate needs more than that to tackle the  subject.<br />As a working mathematician I use the book mostly as a list of  formulas.
