Perhaps reading the book might have lead to a different experience since so many people do love the author. I did expect more, more heart-felt emotion, more drama, scintillating prose but no none of that. Stories that touch chaerters who seem to be going through great emotive periods but author just watches them from a distance describing their clothes instead of their motives. The stories seem to me to be written by a depressed English major who describes scenes but can not go below the skin of the character. Either from lack of understanding or fear, I cant tell.<br /><br />Previous to this, I had just finished reading David Sedaris. OK, he is known as a humorous writer but by Gosh, every sentence of his writing packs more punch than all stories in this book. He is not afraid to tell you ALL. I dont want to say that these stories are flat because I feel intimidated by all the accolades here but thats what they are. Uninspiring - to me.	2005-09-27

These are not books, these are miniature architectural masterpieces and Robert Sabuda is the Lenonardo of this art. He is an artist certainly but he is just as good of an engineer to construct these amazements.<br /><br />The first popup of the Golden Gate bridge uses a see-through plastic material which is something new in popup books, but why not, it works! Although I must say this book is a bit over the top in complexity.  Each new Sabuda book is such an extravganza that I worry that he will exhaust his bag of paper tricks. So I wish him a long life so he can keep producing these books one per every year.<br /><br />Ocassionaly the printing quality is not quite there (I bought 3) but I don't mind, all is forgiven.

This version is a huge improvement over the last one. This one covers all the new advances and adds emphasis on the use of coding to communications channels. A complaint I had of the last version was that it under-emphasized coding gains and Eb/N0 vs. BER performance figures. This book has overcome many of those difficulties. It is still a bit ponderous in places but then it is the only book that covers the material in this much detail, truly a Bible of the field.

I like many of the ideas in the book for supplementation. I have four children so it covers the gamut. I do not homeschool so it was helpful in identifying what else I should be thinking about.<br />I did not particular care for some of the recommendations however. Not all sources receommneded are good. One example is a phonics book I purchased to teach my son to read. My son is four years old and I found that book is not well targeted to this group. I found similar problems with a few other resources, so I wonder if the authors really examine their receommendations carefully. So when deciding to buy a book that is recommended, you need to be careful. Otherwise, the ideas are great and pointed me generally in the direction I should be going.<br />I am usually bothered by the religious emphasis in homeschooling type of books, but this book has a moderate tone and does not overdo the religious angle.	2004-03-12

Characters are NOT deep they are just overdone. Take for example Mrs. Singh. 99.99% of Indian women do not smoke, especially one who has a last name of Singh. Women with last name &quot;Singh&quot; and 99% of them are Sikh do not smoke. It is against their religion.<br />Take another character, the detective and infact take the whole amazingly stupid police department that he belongs to, a police department that never investigates the prime suspect's background, no finger prints, no searches, nothing. After watching numerous missing girls cases on TV, how believable is that I ask you! And then the murderer ups and goes missing easy as you please and does any one think that that might be a little strange! Does anyone go looking?

I told my husband who is a pediatrician that he needs to make this a required reading for every parent that walks in his door.<br />The book is a collection of essays, each covering a particular age, from daycare to preschool to tweens and so on. Each essay discusses the the pernicious effect of such venerable institutions as Sesame Street (sugar-coated fast pace pushing of empty movie and TV icons) on our children. In every essys, her analysis is so completely on the mark.<br />We are being manipulated and as parents we are not fighting. We buy tank tops for our tweens, high-cut bikini underwear and all sort of nonsense with out a whimper. We allow our baby girls to dress like Vegas show girls and are brainwahsed into thinking that it means nothing and has no effect on our girls' psyche.

You get no feeling of Botswana at all.

The book does a great job of providing a structure by offering mini-algorithms for solving common algebra problems such as mixtures, time and distance, coin mixes. Each problem is superbly explained with a system that child can at first use to solve the problem even though he/she is not actually &quot;getting&quot; it. However, they do get it soon enough. I did each chapter with my children and then had them do the test problems. The exercise problems are a bit tough and could have been simpler. In fact I ended up making supplementry problems to help them ease into the concepts. But no matter, I still consider this book heads above others.

The best part about this book is the language. It just sparkles with wit and humor. Even the cliches are used in fresh ways. The story is complex enough that you stay interested in the characters. The focus however is on the heroine and not the story. She (the heroine) is somewhat tarted up, and sex-hungry, probably because the author believes that gratitous and anonymous sex makes a book sell better and not beacuse it fits the character. This part of the heroine's personality does not ring true. It would have been more believable if the heroine lusted after the CEO with whom she has regular contact. But I think the writing makes it a worthwhile read, much better than higher rated Jennifer Crusie books in the same genre.	2002-01-07

I kept getting sidetracked by my daughter while trying to read it they way they suggest. Why all this regimentation? The pages are intimidating for a child. The stories in most cases are too long for child just starting out. There are better books out there. Look for them. I dont suggest this book, as you wont finish it.	2001-01-09
US	51296786	R3AP96MHGY11N2	0071347682	419287510	When the Dow Breaks: Insights & Strategies for Protecting Your Profits in a Turbulent Market	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	Another great book	I consider Mr. Cassidy's first book, &quot;Its when you sell that counts&quot; a classic. I have read this book at least three times and each time got something new out of it. This book is no different. It is equally masterful in conveying its message and has something significant to say.	2000-12-30
US	51296786	R3ENNO9ML1DBZG	0890065306	177227724	OFDM for Wireless Multimedia Communications (Artech House Universal Personal Communications)	Books	3	25	28	N	Y	Not your ultimate OFDM book	If you are looking for a book that clearly explains the mysteries of OFDM and COFDM then, you will have to wait. This is not that book. Much is left to &quot;as an exercise for the student.&quot; There is some generic stuff on coding but how it relates to multipath mitigation is not clear. There are no good pictures of spectrums. The effect of amplifier non-linearities is inadequately addressed. The concept of IFFT as applied to modulation is not explained in a way you can understand it quickly. The section on coherent and differential detection is uneven in the amount of detail and understandability. The whole book has in places either too much math or not enough. There is no section on performance that tells you what the end to performance might be. Good try but far from perfect.<br />Charan Langton	2000-12-04

Gives clear undertanding of how to create marginal advantage for yourself by understaning spreads  between bid and ask. I dont day trade but I have stopped buying stocks at  market and only buy at limit and otherwise try to take advantage of the  spread. This to me was the most important lesson and I have learned it  well. I would recommend this book to a thinking person.	1999-12-30

My dream, but looks like David Cohen and his family got to it first. What I like most about the book are the desctription of the children. One in particular about turning the back to  Grand Canyon to look at a chipmunk has become a family favorite.<br />I am  looking forward to an another book by the author.	1999-09-28
