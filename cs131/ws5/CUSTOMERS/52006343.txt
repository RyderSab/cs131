If you are familiar with this author's previous works you will find very little in this book which is new. He discussed the \\"new low\\" filter and the several variants of his original MACD indicator more than twenty years ago. MACD was then, and is now, a lagging indicator with dubious utility.<br /><br />The research that the author cares to share with the book's purchaser is largely stale-dated or inaccurate. For example, where Appel discusses a non-original indicator, such as VIX, he states that it gives only long-term indications and that it has not yet been determined how to use this working tool for shorter-term indications. In fact, VIX is one of the better intermediate-term working tools - you can prove this for yourself! Go to stockcharts.com, run a weekly Sharp-chart of $VIX with a five week RSI. This 5 week RSI indicates bottoms in the weekly $SPX at readings in excess of 60, and tops in the $SPX at readings of 40 or below. Run a comparable chart for the $SPX and compare the weekly swing highs and lows with the 5 week RSI readings on the $VIX. You will find a quite good correlation! (Also, the weekly new low indicator can be used in the same manner to test for market bottoms - simply construct a 5 week RSI and see how well the market bottoms are pointed-out at readings in excess of 60.)<br /><br />It is somewhat amazing to me how some authors repackage old stuff, which was only moderately useful when it was new, and sell it long after the point of diminishing returns has been passed. This is an OK book for someone just starting out in the markets - but I feel that there are many better ones available, such as by authors, John Murphy, Alexander Elder, and Van Tharp.	2005-05-29

As some other reviews of this book state, there are NO perfect mathematical formulae for selecting investments. No formula can consistently anticipate all of the myriad changes that can affect a particular issue in the highly fluid, dynamic universe of investments. All valuation formulae are simplistic constructs which are used in the place of an elusive, magical crystal ball to derive either the absolute or relative worth of financial instruments. And all such constructs must be based upon assumptions (which are subject to all sorts of errors)- all of them!<br /><br />Perhaps the most widely-used financial formulae today are based on some variant of discounted cash flow (DCF). But DCF requires selection of an appropriate discount rate, a forecast of future cash flows, and some kind of wild-eyed guess as to the investment's terminal value. Calculations which substitute earnings for cash flow are hopelessly flawed from the outset! Any calculation which uses a forecast is probably \\"in over its head\\" before any processing is done.<br /><br />Since we cannot find the perfect formula which will yield calculations of 100% certainty, perhaps we should base our investment philosophy on skilled analyses of financial statements. However, financial statements are also built upon (possibly flawed or outdated) assumptions and conventions, and are hopelessly backward-looking while markets are always forward-looking. Financial information is too stale and is often inaccurate (vide ENRON or WorldCom, etc.).<br /><br />Maybe following news releases would be better. However, because markets are discounting mechanisms, most of the financially important events are already incorporated into the market price before the news is released. Try an experiment: record the breaking news stories, both positive and negative, on any financial news network and see how well the companies and their stock prices perform 30, 90, 180, and 365 days after the news release. On many of the positive stories, you will find that the stock price will sell no, or only marginally, higher on the day of the release, and thereafter. You will often find the converse for negative news releases. Buying on positive- or selling on negative- releases is not likely the way to make consistent profits in the financial markets.<br /><br />Then there is technical analysis, which is often not very technical at all. Last week, a major bank group fired the entire staff from its 45 year-old technical analysis department because the bank's management could not find added value to its overall operations from this department. However, Andrew Lo, et. al., from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, performed a study on technical analysis over a 30 year period and found that certain indicators provided an incremental benefit to investment returns over the period studied. There may be some utility to be mined from this area.<br /><br />All the above said, Lee's book offers a simple method for selecting undervalued stocks from the universe of the Dow Jones 30 Industrials. Best yet, the raw data is available for free on the Value Line web site. The author uses past data to derive an average benchmark based upon how the issue previously traded against its book value. (Academic research has shown price versus book value to have some predictive ability.) I have performed sample testing on Lee's method and feel that it is useful in providing the average investor a fighting chance in: 1) safeguarding one's capital funds; and 2) earning a reasonable (if not superior) rate of market return. (Superior returns are possible, however I feel very strongly that such superior returns are often the product of sufficient capital, stringent loss control, the direction of the secular trend, selection of the appropriate vehicle, and L-U-C-K.)<br /><br />I believe that Lee's methodology makes sense and is workable for somebody wanting to manage one's own investment funds and understand the process of stock selection. While this method is not perfect and will probably lead to less than perfect results, it will likely provide satisfactory long-term results for the individual investor who doesn't mind crunching his or her own numbers.obably lead to less than perfect results, it will likely provide satisfactory long-term results for the individual investor who doesn't mind crunching his or her own numbers.	2005-03-02

This is a well-researched and well-written little book that largely demolishes the case supporting Will Shaksper of Stratford as the writer of the great poems and plays penned by \\"Will Shake-speare.\\" Although he advocates the recognition of Edward deVere, Earl of Oxford, as the true author, Ogburn simply lacks the hard evidence required to develop a sufficient argument to ensure the triumph of his thesis.<br /><br />The true writer of the plays is acknowledged by most authorities to have been intimately acquainted with English Court life, civil law, military procedures, and to have possessed more than a passing familiarity with Italian customs and geography. It is impossible to connect the man from Stratford with any of this. In his lifetime, Shaksper was never publicly connected with the authorship of any of the plays or poems. When Shaksper died, no obituaries were written which mourned the passing of a great author. There is no evidence that the people of Stratford connected Shaksper with any of the writings. No monument was constructed in Shake-speare's honor in Stratford until decades later. Many years after Shaksper died and the plays had become attributed to him, a local priest scoured the countryside trying to collect Shake-speare memorabilia but found - absolutely nothing: no books; no letters; or no diaries!<br /><br />Shaksper's will, written by him, mentioned all of his possessions in great detail down to the disposition of his second-best bed, but was totally silent about any books, plays, poems, or literary works of any kind. Neither books, manuscripts, works-in-progress, fragments, nor any but a single letter (written to him) concerning a commercial transaction  (there is no evidence that Shake-speare or Shaksper ever wrote a letter to anybody) have ever been found or referred to in any manner of surviving print. For an author who is estimated to have used more than 20,000 different words in his writings, as compared to the next most prolific wordsmith, John Milton (who used 12,000), Shaksper's school that he attended had only thirteen books in its library. Shaksper had no further formal education after leaving a remote public school which was hardly at the forefront of critical thinking. Shaksper's daughter and grand-daughter, whom he loved, died illiterate.<br /><br />In \\"The Tempest,\\" Shake-speare wrote: \\"We are such stuff/ As dreams are made on and our little life/ Is rounded with a sleep...\\" But Shaksper composed and had the following verse placed upon his headstone as an epitaph: \\"Good friends for Iesus' [Jesus'] sake forbeare/ To digg the dust encloased heare:/ Blest be ye [the] man yt [that] spares thes stones/ And curst be he yt moves my bones.\\" A comparison between these two passages leads to the same type of quandary which was encountered by such literary notables as Walt Whitman and Mark Twain. Whitman (who was gay) recognized that a large portion of Shake-speare's sonnets described an intense, passionate relationship between an older, notorious, lame man (the author) and a much younger nobleman. The author of the sonnets referred to both his and the young man's elevated social status several times. When the sonnets were published, the around 40 year-old Shaksper was neither as old as the sonnets implied nor hardly of an elevated social status - either the author was having a flight of fancy or was actually a nobleman, himself. In Elizabethan times, commoners did not socialize with or act in a familiar manner towards the nobility. Also, Shaksper's position as a commoner did not grant him the privilege to be notorious! Mark Twain felt that his research into Shake-speare's life uncovered serious irregularities in considering Shaksper to have written the plays. Twain wrote a humorous article detailing his research findings (some of which are inaccurate) titled, \\"Is Shakespeare Dead?\\" This article is available on the Internet and is worth reading.<br /><br />Through the years, other authors have been suggested as being the true Shake-speare: Marlowe; Bacon; deVere; etc. However, no further proof than supposition has ever been hurled against the edifice erected by the Stratfordians. Until such time as hard evidence is forthcoming - which is not very likely after the passing of four centuries, Will Shaksper's authenticity  will remain under a very small cloud to a small group of Shakespearean scholars. While I also entertain doubts about Shaksper, it should be duly noted that doubts aside, it is impossible to totally rule him out as being the true author! (If one studies the polished elegance, wit, and wisdom contained in the writings of Abraham Lincoln it is astonishing to realize that Lincoln was largely self-educated and developed his intellect far from the halls of established academia.) The Shake-speare authorship controversy is a fascinating puzzle which will never likely be satisfactorily resolved.-speare: Marlowe; Bacon; deVere; etc. However, no further proof than supposition has ever been hurled against the edifice erected by the Stratfordians.

On page 290 of \\"Wall Street Ventures, etc.\\" we find:<br /><br />\\"For many years there have been methods of transmitting secret advices by means of code letters and words printed in certain sections of daily newspapers. Formerly these advices were brief and simple, though quite effectively used among those who were 'wise.' They have since been greatly elaborated. If you have some knowledge of the subject, studying these signals, advices or forecasts, you can see that they emanate from the headquarters of important interests, and that they forecast the trend of the market in general, and certain stocks.<br /><br />\\"People may think this improbable; entirely too uncanny in this day of modern business procedure. But I know exactly what I am writing about!<br /><br />\\"However, I cannot advise anyone to search for this secret 'Open Sesame.' There never was a secret code which could not be changed on short notice.\\"<br /><br />Wyckoff penned this book containing the above drivel in 1930, several years after he suffered an almost fatal aneurysm in the brain. He never completely regained his health from the time of his stroke until the time of his death in the early 1930s. He had already lost control of his flagship company, \\"The Magazine of Wall Street,\\" after a bitter divorce. His career as the leading promoter of stock market advice, stock tips, books, and systems was effectively finished.<br /><br />The earlier Wyckoff was an excellent, engaging writer who wrote many well-crafted books on trading, the best of which was \\"Studies in Tape Reading,\\" last revised in 1924. Wyckoff's highly popular magazine articles effectively established the career of W. D. Gann, and made Jesse Livermore somewhat of a household name. His books were written largely in the manner of the stock market astrologer, Sepharial, in that the reader always needed to purchase one other book or service to clarify the author's message (this was not true of \\"Studies, etc.\\"). \\"Wall Street Ventures, etc.\\" is no different. It is a veiled advertisement for the author's (then) soon-to-be-released correspondence course on trading. The footnote on page 303 suggests the true purpose of this book: \\"Some of my friends have suggested that I undertake to teach say one hundred people the fine points of what experience has taught me so that they may be able to operate successfully in the stock market.\\" This statement, of course, implies that what he had written prior to the upcoming course had NOT prepared readers for operating successfully in the stock market!<br /><br />I have a 1934 edition of Wyckoff's course and, true to form, one had to subscribe to his market letter to find the volume-volatility characteristics on his \\"wave chart\\" that was his alleged, indispensable key to short-term trading! Although the author promised in the promotional literature that this course would develop stand-alone traders, and that full details would be given for constructing the wave chart, at the end of the course he blatantly recommended signing-up for his market letter so that the course graduate could keep current with the vital factors not disclosed in the course!<br /><br />(It should be noted that in 1929, \\"The Magazine of Wall Street,\\" then operated by Wyckoff's ex-wife, was totally blind-sided by the crash and its prelude. My copies of this magazine indicate only the rosiest of expectations for the economy and markets at the dawning of the 1930s. While I have no copies of the magazine's investor-service letters, I feel that the magazine performed a significant disservice to its subscribers in recommending that they remain fully-invested at the market's top [the level of which was not revisited for a quarter of a century]!)<br /><br />\\"Ventures, etc.\\" is the life story of a person who happened to be associated with Wall Street. If one reads this book with the expectation of gaining investment or trading pointers, he or she will be disappointed. However, Wyckoff had lost little of his entertaining, easy to read, writing style. If you are interested in gaining an understanding of the events that shaped the life of an early, 20th century writer and stock market service promoter, then you will probably like this book.<br /><br />While I can only mildly recommend \\"Wall Street Ventures, etc.\\" to readers who really like Wyckoff, I strongly recommend the author's \\"Studies in Tape Reading\\" for the student of historical stock market writings. It is full of good, timeless advice and interesting vignettes of a bygone financial era.

Nietzsche advocates social change in order for humankind to rise above its present deplorable condition. He says that God is dead and is no longer a model for moral leadership. He counsels us that redirecting our focus from the unknowable to the knowable will guide us towards the journey to humankind's next incarnation - the Superman. In order to begin this evolutionary journey we will first have to experience a great revulsion at the current human condition. In this \\"hour of great contempt\\" we will deny all of our previous, favorable conceptions concerning happiness, reason, virtue, justice, sympathy, and sin. Instead, we will embrace over-going, down-going, despisers, earth-worshipers, seekers of practical knowledge, workers, inventors, true virtue, altruists, achievers, and free spirits.<br /><br />Nietzsche believes that all of the present, negative social trends will culminate in the most contemptible of all beings - the last man - who is no longer capable of despising himself. This last man will live in a condition which he has helped create of fear, false happiness, pleasure-seeking, working as a pastime, over-concern for the feelings of others, egalitarianism, and cleverness without wisdom. Further, once the last man evolves, the social environment that has created him (and he has also, reflexively, created this environment) will be somewhat permanent because it will tend to absorb all differences of opinion, merge them into a consensus, and reflect them back into society through an opinion-shaping filter of egalitarianism voiced in politically correct terms. In a moment of irony, the crowd called-out to the sage, Zarathustra, to \\"make us into these last men.\\"<br /><br />It is arguable that the last man is alive and well in contemporary society, and that the intellectual, social, and regional diversities which once generated the rich and vibrant hues of the American canvas are being replaced with a drab, homogeniety of sterile sameness. Nietzsche feels that the ultimate, inevitable revulsion against and overthrow of the kingdom of the last man will give rise to its polar opposite - the spiritually elevating, authentic world of the Superman.<br /><br />The author has an almost compelling thesis, however, his bipolar construct ranging from the last man to the Superman seems to minimize the fact that objective reality represents only a small group of choices from an infinite pool of alternatives. The world will not long march to the tune of a single drummer, be he the last man or Superman, because of how unchanging human nature is constituted. A first constant of human nature seems to be that we are well aware of our own situation, but only remotely aware of others' concerns. A second constant seems to be that we will, on the average, tend to maximize our chances for immediate personal benefit over chances for potentially greater long-term gain. Therefore, we will, on balance, tend to act in ways which maximize our own short-term self-interest. We probably always have and likely always will. If history is any guide to the future, attempts to reshape the world modelled after the vision of a Superman (or even the last man) will be morphed to unrecognizable dimensions by the unfolding, collective self-interest of individuals in the day-to-day process of following their own, personal stars.<br /><br />Although I feel that Nietzsche's prescribed alternatives are distortions of reality through oversimplification, misdirection, and projection to a whole from a subset, his work is a highly-influential, excellent read.hat the ultimate, inevitable revulsion against and overthrow of the kingdom of the last man will give rise to its polar opposite - the spiritually elevating, authentic world of the Superman. <br /> <br />The author has an almost compelling thesis, however, his bipolar construct ranging from the last man to the Superman seems to minimize the fact that objective reality represents only a small group of choices from an infinite pool of alternatives.

I like this book. The documentation is solid and the logical exposition is nearly flawless. The authors build a compelling case for restructuring one's portfolio to include a large gold component. If one scans the charts, COMEX gold has made a huge, rounding turn from 1996 to 2004. The high price of this formation is 420 and the low price 260. A measuring implication on this formation suggests an upside target price of 580, which is a potential 32% gain. [420-260=160+420=580.] Gold has completed this formation with a bullish, upside breakout. In order for gold to reach this target price, the dollar has to continue its slide to oblivion. However, there are signs that the dollar index is stabilizing and trying to climb to 90 from its current price of 83.<br /><br />What makes me suspicious about the fruition of the authors' thesis is that there is too much company from other writers such as Richard Duncan, Ferdinand Lips, Jim Rogers, Peter Warburton, etc. It is arguable that this book presently represents the view of the crowd rather than expressing a contrarian worldview. In my experience, real, damaging crises arrive both quickly and unannounced. Seldom do we have the luxury of time for discussing the onset and progression of a crisis through the mass media in a calm, rational manner and have the year or more it takes to write and publish books about how to survive and prosper from the crisis. As a matter of fact, there is much evidence that when books about impending crises become available to the mass markets, the danger is substantially past. Irrationality - not rationality - is the ding an sich of financial markets!<br /><br />Financial markets are discounting mechanisms that make the best use of forecasts, from all information which is known, to augur the likely level and trend of profits from nine to eighteen months in advance. What we read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, Investor's Business Daily, or the Financial Times hardly qualifies as being news which can move the markets because the markets have already anticipated the impact of the events before the stories appeared in print.<br /><br />To make matters worse, if the authors' thesis is correct and comes to pass, it is not likely that the average investor would have the prescience, ability, or resources necessary for weathering the financial storm - even armed with this book! A financial panic of this magnitude would have the most dire geopolitical consequences. Playing with numbers would be futile. The only safe harbor would be a move of one's person and possessions to some island of stability, such as Switzerland.<br /><br />I personally believe that the severe decree can (and will) be averted. I feel that there is still resiliance in the western tradition. Most of the ills besetting the US today can be traced to a recent history of an overstrong dollar which gave rise to the Japanese and Chinese economic miracles, a highly-promoted culture of rampant consumerism, and the misguided, suicidal \\"free\\" trade agreements of the past twenty years. I think that the changing demographics in the US will encourage saving and investment over consumption, a rationalization of the current and capital account imbalances, and a total discrediting of and revulsion from the New World Order paradigm.<br /><br />Don't worry - be happy!being news which can move the markets because the markets have already anticipated the impact of the events before the stories appeared in print. <br /> <br />To make matters worse, if the authors' thesis is correct and comes to pass, it is not likely that the average investor would have the prescience, ability, or resources necessary for weathering the financial storm - even armed with this book!

Rawls defines human society as an association, guided by a common conception of justice, which attempts to advance the good of its members. He states that justice concerns the distribution of the greatest good over the broadest possible extent of the membership base. The author describes the principle of utility as holding that a society is rightly ordered and just when its institutions are organized in such manner that the greatest sum of satisfactions is realized. However, this utilitarian notion of justice does not prescribe any requirements as to how the sum of satisfactions is to be distributed among its members. Rawls notes that depriving some members of satisfactions so that a larger number may enjoy those satisfactions is not justified.<br /><br />Rawls says that the most rational alternative to utilitarianism is the Kantian theory of the social contract. A major problem with this social contract is the irrational assumption that the contractors will agree to limit their freedoms so that others may enjoy a greater amount of satisfactions. Utilitarianism is free from this irrationality. Rawls advocates the incorporation of two principles of justice into utilitarianism: 1) each person should have equal rights in institutional dealings (most likely a constitutional democracy); and 2) any institutional inequalities should be arbitrary and not directed at any specific individual or group. These principles will tend to minimize the structural favoritism of society to certain people over others which affect their life-prospects. The second principle, referred to as the difference principle, further states that any chronic inequalities are just only if they work to the advantage of the least powerful member. Adoption of this difference principle will benefit the larger society by fostering the widest possible distribution of natural talents and abilities through the minimization of the advantages of birth-fortune. A perfectly just society is an efficient society - the optimal distribution of resources, welfare, and justice will promote the greatest sum of happiness.<br /><br />The message contained in this modern classic is a fundamental building block in our quest for the creation of just, equitable, and good society.the optimal distribution of resources, welfare, and justice will promote the greatest sum of happiness. <br /> <br />The message contained in this modern classic is a fundamental building block in our quest for the creation of just, equitable, and good society.	2005-01-19

I am interested in Mill's contributions to utilitarian philosophy. Utilitarianism holds that morals should be based upon those acts which promote the greatest good to the greatest number of people. Human actions which foster happiness are held to be right, while those which yield the converse are wrong. Mill defines happiness as intended pleasure with the absence of pain. Also, he maintains that intended pleasure and freedom from pain are the only things desirable as personal ends. Pleasure which employs one's higher faculties tends to give more satisfaction than baser pleasures, or mere sensations. Few humans would exchange their limited, fleeting pleasures for the fullest ration of the pleasures of the \\"lower\\" animals. Since a noble character is made happier by its nobleness, utilitarianism can only attain its end towards the multiplication of happiness through a general elevation of the nobleness of the character of the larger population.<br /><br />Mill states that pleasures and pains have different values to the actor. Only the judgment honed by experience can assist us in assessing appropriate trade-offs in acquiring a particular pleasure at the cost of gaining a specific pain as well. This type of cost/benefit analysis advocated by utilitarians gives rise to the criticism that utilitarianism results in coldness and lack of sympathy towards others. However, Mill claims that the proof of the worth of utilitarianism, or any other moral system, lies in its ability to produce good results.<br /><br />Although it is sometimes difficult to wade through the dryness of Mill's rhetoric, it is truly worth it for the philosophical insights contained. This book is a good survey of Mill's thoughts on utilitarian ethics and many other subjects of value.	2005-01-18

At the back of the book is a chart showing wheat prices along with the corresponding planetary positions. Although there seems to be a weak-form correlation, visually, it does not appear likely that this method would be profitable.<br /><br />The second method presented uses two different-sized ellipse overlays to indicate the beginning, mid-point, and endings of trends. While this method seems to have merit, it will run into scaling problems if the relation of the length of the ellipse to the size of the graph does not maintain the appropriate Mercury-cycle dimensions. Two less-troublesome, modern-day equivalents are Bollinger bands and Wilder's parabolic system. Bollinger bands are useful in determining potential high and low points in trading markets, while the parabolic system functions as both an entry method and a trailing stop in trending markets.<br /><br />The third method presented is the \\"Polish ellipse\\" and is another overlay placed upon counter-trend reactions. With the instructions given, the \\"Polish ellipse\\" is in effect, a wave-counter which is useful for timing the five waves in an Elliott-wave expansion sequence. It also seems to handle wave extensions quite well. This method has some utility if scaling problems do not get in the way.<br /><br />The fourth method is an oscillator which aids in picking tops and bottoms. The construction presented by Bayer has a troublesome, built-in lag. However, if all of the factors are step-weighted and ranged in a 5-5-3-3 sequence, the oscillator becomes a coincident indicator and its utility is markedly enhanced.<br /><br />The fifth method is \\"squaring the circle\\" and is useful for projecting potential support and resistance areas from any given high or low pivot prices. However, where Bayer indicates \\"points,\\" it is better to use percentages.<br /><br />While some of Bayer's methods are clearly better than others, all are interesting and can be used as starting points for further research. The historical value of this book is three-fold, it: 1) is the first book (of which I am aware) to offer a complete methodology for trading; 2) shows the trail of reasoning of a market practitioner as trades actually matured; and 3) indicates that money and markets are no more than a very insignificant supplement to what is required for living a valued and productive life.ncident indicator and its utility is markedly enhanced.

This non-traditional book on trading methods is based upon geometric techniques (which are always subject to potential scaling errors), numerology, and stock market astrology.

However, Welles Wilder's parabolic system is more rational and not subject to scaling problems.<br /><br />It should be duly noted that in Mr. Bayer's final market letter to his clients (in 1939), he apologized for making a lot of wrong calls on the market's direction!	2004-12-15

Since cycles can extend, shorten, invert, and skip, Gann offers several trend-following methods to minimize damage from forecasting mistakes and to keep one on the right side of the markets. His excellent, 24 trading rules afford advice on money management, risk management, trend-following, trade entry, and exit techniques that are currently valid.<br /><br />Gann always openly hinted that the details for his celebrated forecasting method were concealed in his writings. This book, as is all others written by Gann, is written on two levels. The first level is expository and describes how to swing-trade. The arcana submerged in the second level can be approached by examining the recurrent themes about time, price, and geometry, and the dates which he feels are significant. Details for Gann's time and price model are contained in all of his books and major courses with the exception of \\"Tunnel Through the Air.\\"<br /><br />Strangely, the weakest part of this book is the final chapter with Gann's predictions for the early 1950s. Gann felt that 1953 was going to be a year of post-war depression rivalling the great depression of the 1930s. His cycle model indicated a strong down-turn which actually became a cyclical inversion where the market turned sharply upwards - such are the hazards of public forecasting! However, Gann followers should not have lost money during the 1953 inversion, because their swing-trade methods would have self-corrected this forecast error.<br /><br />Whatever level one chooses to tackle, this book is a worthwhile addition to anyone's trading library.<br /><br />Addendum, March 29, 2011, projected important stock market dates: 01/24/11; 03/18/11; 03/28/11; 04/25/11; 06/20/11; 07/07/11; 08/08/11; 09/06/11; 10/26/11; 11/21/11; 12/12/11; 01/17/12; 03/12/12; 04/09/12; 05/07/12; 06/11/12; 07/23/12; 08/20-23/12; 11/05/12; 11/26/12; 12/12/12; and 01/17/13.1/12; 07/23/12; 08/20-23/12; 11/05/12; 11/26/12; 12/12/12; and 01/17/13.	2004-12-11

If you like to read investment books written by in-your-face, stock market evangelists - this one might be for you! The late author rants and raves about evil insiders and the invisible-but-powerful \\"they\\" throughout the book. He seemed to advocate that his life-experience gained as a grade school drop-out, lumberjack, and stevedore gave him a unique perspective on viewing financial markets and qualified him as an investment authority. However, it is doubtful that this book will help you attain your investment goals.<br /><br />The major problem I have with this book is that its methodology is based upon a common scaling error found in numerous charting systems. The author suggests purchasing issues that have had a significant decline in price and have broken-out of a subsequent, multiyear accumulation base. This accumulation base appears as a quiet period where the price fluctuates in a very narrow area while it is passing from weak to strong hands. The author used M. C. Horsey's \\"Stock Picture\\" as a resource for discovering such issues. Unfortunately, the monthly Horsey charts are arithmetically scaled. Stocks that were once at 50 on the chart and have declined to 10 will have all the lower priced activity compressed or squashed by the nature of the arithmetic chart. A 10% advance beginning at 50 would take the price up 5 to 55, while a like advance beginning at 5 would take the price up by only 0.50 to 5.50. Therefore, what appears to be an ideal trade set-up for Mr. Warren totally disappears when a more correct semi-logarithmic scale, which is calibrated to indicate percentage movements, is used. The reality described by Mr. Warren may not be the reality one encounters in real-time trading. The arithmetic quiet period is often a semi-logarithmeic roller-coaster, since lower-priced shares can be extremely volatile - for example, EFJI's share price recently collapsed by 11% in a single day! After selecting and purchasing a stock (or commodity), the author would follow his trades by traditional technical analysis tools such as trendlines, etc. I feel that his description of the technical method is rudimentary and simplistic!<br /><br />Earning a superior investment return is hard work in a highly competitive field. Un- or inadequately-prepared dilettantes generally lose their capital sooner rather than later: the average futures account is bankrupt after only four months! There is much more utility and pre-packaged wisdom for the average investor in the standard works written by John Murphy, Martin Pring, and Alexander Elder - who all know what they are talking about and are excellent writers. I am certain that using the prescriptions outlined in Warren's book will disappointingly fall far short of \\"making the stock market make money for you!\\"<br /><br />Of special note - \\"A fool and his/her money is soon parted!\\"<br /><br />Investment Training Material Marketer Settles FTC Charges<br /><br />FOR RELEASE<br />March 24, 2003<br /><br />An operator who used deceptive claims to market commodities, stock, real estate and other investment courses has agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that his deceptive claims violated federal law.

Harold McKinley Gartley had a stock market advisory service in the mid-1930s that had a large public following. This service was one of the first to apply \\"scientific\\" methods and research to resolution of the stock market problems: 1)what to buy; and 2) when to buy. This correspondence course is a summarization of Gartley's findings through 1936. The original course was issued looseleaf, in a green, three-ring binder. Lambert-Gann, Inc. has reissued this course in a more convenient book-format along with a separate package of oversized charts for easy reference against the textual explanations.<br /><br />Gartley covers, in great depth, the Dow theory, market movements, bar charting, figure charting, volume of trading, price formations, relative strength, moving averages, oscillators, and breadth measuremants. He presents copious references to indicate from where he got his material and numerous footnotes for text clarification or expansion. There is very little that one finds in the literature of technical analysis today that was not covered in Gartley's work. The book is well-researched and well-written. Unfortunately, Gartley's idea of \\"scientific\\" study is somewhat primitive as measured against today's standards. His approach was more rational-intuitive than statistical. (A good example of the methods he employed can be found in Gartley's \\"Stock Market Probability Tables\\" published by the author in 1940.)<br /><br />While I feel that this is the best and most complete work on technical analysis ever compiled, the lack of apparent progress over the past seventy years in the theoretical underpinnings of the technical analysis field seems to cast a shadow of doubt over its basic methodology. Personally, I have never found much use in the Dow Theory (subjective and late signals); price patterns (one tends to see what one wants to see); etc. The core of technical analysis can be summarized as, \\"A price trend will continue until it reverses.\\" Problems arise in precisely defining what time period is relevant, what constitutes a valid trend inside the timeframe, and how a valid trend reversal is to be determined - all in such manner that result in an investment return greater than a buy-and-hold strategy. Current statistical evidence for the utility of technical analysis in generating profits in excess of buy-and-hold is not encouraging.<br /><br />If you are interested in technical analysis, you really need to become familiar Gartley's work and perspective.

In his biography of Livermore written in the 1960s, Paul Sarnoff interviewed a number of people who knew and worked with Livermore. \\"How to Trade... \\" was apparently written in 1940 at a low ebb in Livermore's life - he was soon to commit suicide. Livermore wrote this book to promote a stockmarket advisory service that he was starting, to supplement his declining income. That's why the book has several illustrations of Livermore's business coat-of-arms bearing the insignia, \\"The Livermore Market Key.\\"<br /><br />The book presents some good, general market advice. However, the trading workshop detailed at the end is interesting, but not very useful. The trading method is swing-based and requires move confirmation by another stock in the same sector. I attempted to test this method, as best as I could, but cut the test short when it became quickly apparent that the result would be suboptimal. The method Livermore presents here is vastly inferior to Gann's swing trading method published by Robert Krausz (GET THIS ONE!!!).<br /><br />Paul Sarnoff felt that Livermore's reputation was largely hyped and over-rated. He felt that Livermore was more successful at acquiring positive publicity than in trading stocks and commodities (Arthur Cutten bested him several times in major battles). Paul Sarnoff was the real thing! He was a successful broker-trader-author who was financial advisor to Billy Rose (then the largest private shareholder of AT&T common) and a host of other notables. That Sarnoff expressed doubts about the trading reputation of Livermore, is a fact that should not be lightly discounted.<br /><br />If you liked LeFevre's account of Livermore's life, you might find this to be an worthwhile expansion of some of those themes and ideas.	2004-09-01

This is an \\"ok\\" book that describes supposed trading methods of some \\"old master\\" traders in terms of an event-based trading model. This model requires buying upside breakouts from congestion areas on increasing volume during bull markets. This is a good method if one's disposition can withstand generally high-volatility trades. However, to claim that this mode of trading was actually used by Livermore, Baruch, or Loeb is perhaps claiming too much.<br /><br />Livermore was highly secretive about his trading. Although he discussed his psychology of trading in LeFevre's work, he did not go into much detail about his actual trading method. He later claimed that industry changes wrought by the SEC in the early 1930s made the markets less amenable to his brand of analysis. He made and lost four fortunes and ended his career and life by suicide in 1940.<br /><br />Baruch made a significant portion of his trading gains by means of London - New York arbitrage. There is further evidence that he traded, scalped, value invested, growth stock invested, etc. The trader, Baruch, described in this book is only a microcosm of this highly complex, and multi-faceted individual.<br /><br />Loeb was in, out, and sometimes back in again on a single day on a particular stock! He was a feverish trader! He seldom held a stock for the intermediate-term, and almost never for the long-term. To trade in his manner, one has to be correct a minimum of 30% of the time, and be capitalized enough to bear heavy trading expenses.<br /><br />Nicolas Darvas wrote two books, \\"How I Made $2,000,000 In The Stock Market,\\" and \\"Wall Street: The Other Las Vegas.\\" They are both must reads for the aspiring trader, and best exemplify the event-based model covered by this book under review. Darvas claimed that his trading account went into a nosedive when he continued to use this method during the advent of a bear market.<br /><br />All of O'Neil's works are excellent. Since he is well-known and active today, I will not comment upon the section of the book devoted to him.<br /><br />The method presented is useful if one: 1) is adequately capitalized; 2) exercises tight loss control; 3)has an effective selection filter; and 4) is psychologically equipped for active trading (not many people can successfully do this).

I really wanted to like this book. I've read it twice and spent some considerable time in revisiting the examples trying to become familiar with the author's methodology. However, there seems to be an operative disconnect between the espoused theory and the demonstrated practice.<br /><br />First - the negatives. The author's thesis is that it is possible to predict market turning points in advance by identifying a reaction swing, counting backwards to a prior turning point, and then projecting that periodicity forward to derive a reflective, future turning point. But the author does not precisely define how a reaction swing is identified, or how one reaction swing is to be considered while another is to be ignored. The examples in the book do not address the reasoning involved for practical application of this method. This theoretical shortfall diminishes the utility of the reaction swing concept.<br /><br />Second - the positives. Although this method was suggested before in Roger Babson's action-reaction theory (1910s), the Wetzel Market Bureau's \\"Course in Trading\\" (1930s), and Alan Andrews' course (1960s), it was not so thoroughly developed as it is in this presentation. Also, there are a number of interesting trading systems (set-ups) offered which might prove to be useful.<br /><br />All in all, this book is akin to the photograph of a holy grail as compared to THE HOLY GRAIL. It is an interesting book that presents some time-honored concepts - with a few unresolved issues. More interesting (and usefully profitable) are the Wetzel and Andrews courses.	2004-08-25

This book presents a clear exposition of his successful, break-out trading method. It shows how he was able to ride the winners by using his nested &quot;box&quot; system. Further, it shows how he used &quot;techno-fundamental&quot; screening to select only those issues which had the best chance for sustained rally after the break-out event. Event-trading is useful because it is real-time, gives definite signals, and affords minimal lag in response time. This book should prove to be of great utility to someone who wants to learn to trade or to improve his or her trading skills.	2004-06-14
US	52006343	R2MBLL5FLMS8NU	047084342X	979300097	The Psychology of Finance: Understanding the Behavioral Dynamics of Markets, Revised Edition	Books	4	13	13	N	Y	Make sure you get the first edition!	Tvede presents a good, intermediate-level overview of market trading from a trend-following perspective. He also describes several indicators which are useful in assessing the &quot;temperature&quot; of the trading environment. However, aside from the clarity of his writing and the logical development of his argument, he offers little which is new to the experienced market practitioner.<br />Also, please note that this book was published in two editions. The first edition successfully views the mechanics of trading through the emotional filters which affect our buy-sell decisions. The second edition is a complete rewrite which morphs the book into a nebulous psychology text that is only occasionally related to the trading process. You would be well-served to avoid this second edition! First edition - 4 stars; second edition - 1 star.	2004-06-14
