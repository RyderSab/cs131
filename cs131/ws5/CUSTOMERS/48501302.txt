If you ever get a chance to get this out of print book..please, by all means do so. Sybil Leek was truly a one of a kind person that'll be truly missed. All of her books should be in every wiccan/pagans book shelf for her down to earth and very well explained details about witchcraft..a true classic!	2005-05-15

This is as good as it gets, when dealing with Pagans who have childeren or starting to have them. This book deals with love and relationship not only with the Goddess, but, with \\"family\\" as a whole. Its very well detailed and the stories , songs, and crafts are really fun to do. If you are Pagan, have childeren..make this your \\"starter\\" book first. Highly recommend..well worth the time and the money.	2005-01-12

She has a very good flow into her words and great knowledge. I have to admit, i was sucked into her pages. Many were wonderful chapters that were written in ways i never heard of, but, well understood. Some topics were advanced (not a lot though), but, her \\"explaining\\" was very well detailed and her book didnt read like every other pagan or wiccan author. This book shouldnt be passed up and would have to say its one of the better books on the self this year.	2004-12-25

There are many subjects on the matter of ghosts the \\"what\\", \\"why\\", \\"where\\" and the \\"who\\". What i really like the most is that the author is very forward on filling what needs to be told which is very interesting.  <br />I really have to say, that this is one of the better books on ghosts that i like the most. However, what i didnt like is how the author disclaims that \\"graveyards are not \\"true\\" research\\"..which in my view is false cause ALL research is at value. Anyways, besides that he does make a point and i agree on some of what the author says. Worth the time and the money.	2004-11-25

There is a reason why you should take any words of Kaatryn MacMorgan with a grain of salt. Reason one, is that the author has some very good debate topics and has the research to show in each chapter, however, the author has a bad habit of either contraditing her words or she poorly explains them to the point of giving the reader a headache of mumbo jumbo that the average  person cannot understand. <br />Another reason, why are we still debating the Wiccan Rede?...there are no \\"breaking down\\" as the author puts it. However, to me she fails to put some kind of \\"mumbo jumbo\\" out to the public that they \\"cracked the code\\" from the decoder ring the author got from a craker jack box...nobody cares!. Everybody knows who is a wiccan see it as a \\"poem\\" and only use it as a \\"guideline\\"...thats all!..there should be NO breaking down the Rede in order to \\"understand it\\". The author also uses too much \\"scholar type\\" writing to bore her readers to death with. <br />On page 16 she truly misunderstood what Dion Fortune words of \\"All Gods are One God\\" ment. The author poorly explains this to only confuse the readers. She tells her readers on page 22 , \\"All paths lead to the same place is a good idea that fails in practice\\"...hold on!..she just told readers that not to long ago that \\"they were all different\\"...Is that a contradiction?.. because if we all ended up in the same place after death, that would pretty much explain all paths are equal. The author fails to explain this more. Then by adding fuel to the fire, she adds on page 23 \\"Believing all paths are one path can be seen as a sort of reaction to fundamentalism\\"...very, very untrue this is ONLY in her view. <br />However, even though the book gets a 3 from me, it isnt a bad book to be honest just poorly explained on the topics. However, there are some things she should rewrite on so other readers can understand it better. On page 59 the Tomas Timeline is very well done and very useful. However, the author's \\"run around\\" withnewbies on page 67 is very bad...and this person says she is a teacher?...thats very sad. However, she writes that \\"a smart question assumes nothing\\"...which is true, but, nobody should assume anything because that makes you an ass..which she fails to explain on what real \\"smart questions\\" truly is. Instead, the author plays \\"mind games\\" and not truly answer the questions from the e-mail that the person sent to her...again taking her \\"teaching\\" with a grain of salt. <br />The Celt part on page 72 was pretty good, however, the author has to understand that Wicca never claimed \\"Celtic tradition\\" as their own. Wicca however, uses the Gods and Goddesses they feel comfortable with and blend the \\"influences of Celt tradition\\"..that is all!..nothing more. Every wiccan knows by now that wicca is not Celtic..again she telling readers what we already know. <br />Anyways, I do agree on her chapters on Proselytizing, Facts about Satanism which was very well explained and Forming an Ethical code which was good too. Now, as i said i gave this a 3 because the author has a poor way of explaining things. Now as being advance..that is 50/50. <br />I would try to find something better than this book, in order to look for better advance books about wicca.	2004-08-18

There are so many herb books today, but, not one like this!. Hoodoo magick is interesting and the best way to get into it, is to learn what certain herbs do and why they do it.

Very easy read, not to complex and loaded with a lot of information. His exercises are truly great to do. Each chapter is filled with information that will want the reader wanting more upon subjects about past lives, which includes subjects about karma, soul mates (what they truly are and how you can tell), mysteries about birth and death, animals (Which Mr. Andrews seems to touch on the best) and reincarnation. I highly recommend this book, worth the time and money.	2004-06-30

There were some great info on each stone..however, it left you wanting more but you just couldnt find it and just left you empty. Now as for &quot;American Indian medicine&quot; with stones i just couldnt see it anywhere close, and some of her info were misleading. Anyways, readers looking for healing within the stones should pick up a better book like &quot;Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Crystal, Gem, and Metal Magic&quot; which is the best so far you'll get tons of info from that book than this one.	2004-06-27

I have always liked Frost/Frost and never read the &quot;bad reveiws&quot; about them because most of those &quot;reveiwers&quot; have no clue themself to be honest. However, if your not a fan of Frost/Frost then i say &quot;change the channel and go else where&quot;. Anyways, this book i wasnt truly impressed by. A lot of info in this book i see as &quot;dangerous&quot; not only to one self, but, also those like me who follow the Wiccan Rede and the Three Fold Law. Most subjects such as chapters 5, 6, and 7 are good. However, on chapters 8 , page 182 &quot;You can't afford anything but the best&quot;(which i truly disgree, you should afford what you can tolerate..but, not being snobish or &quot;steal&quot; would do any good), and page 232 &quot;Ann changes her husband's life&quot; (i truly had a problem with this one)..i truly disagree with this cause it truly kills any following of the Wiccan Rede and those who practice it. On page 232 is the worse advice anybody can write to pass on to readers and i truly would say this is very dangerous to one self based on ethics and beliefs. The best writings in the book are about money and how to have a better outlook towards magick and one self.However, i will tell readers to truly be careful when reading this book some of it is good, some misleading and some down right dangerous. So, please take the title of this book with a &quot;grain of salt&quot; cause you might not like what you read. Eventhough, i like Frost/Frost very much, i truly cannot recommend this book to anyone because they have better books than this one.	2004-06-25

However, this is not one of the best. I been making incense for many years..longer than the author has. This book has a lot of misleading stuff that is send out to his readers, including the &quot;so-called&quot; dangers of Saltpeter. Mr. Neal tells folks not to do this, however, when you look at Cunningham's Incense making book, he pretty much says you have to no matter what and he said that its the only way to burn loose incense. Mr. Neal suggests that you burn your loose incense on Bamboo Charcoal, which in my mind is the worst charcoal there is to burn loose incense, reasons...bring a pillow, because it takes that long to wait till it gets hot to burn your incense and sometimes it dies out...so, as you can see, its not the charcoal to use during Sabbats. This book is an OK book,  but, i would only buy it if your local book store doesnt have Cunningham's Complete book of Incense, oils and brew.

It does not make a difference which BOS you choose either Alex Sanders or Gardners cause they are pretty much the same, the only difference in Sanders BOS is that its a backward version of Gardners BOS.

Her books are informative and very, very useful. However, there are some things i agree and some things that i dont. But, with the book Natural Magic is from the heart of this great and very well missed author who went to Summerland not to long ago. I miss her, cause i know that there wont be another like her. I highly recommend this book on your shelf!.	2003-06-09

I love the book very much and found alot of things that are very useful. I liked the legends and the folklore and many stories that i already knew (i like hearing stories from a different side than i already heared). The only thing i had a hard time with is the use of EMF detectors. The reason why, is because they are so sensitive they are hard to use..i question it very much on the EMF detectors. Then i also have to debate the author on page 65, he asks the question &quot;i recently purched a house that is haunted, is there anything that i can do?&quot;. The author comes out of the wood work with such a poor answer of &quot;there is nothing that can be done to get rid of a ghost&quot;...Mr. Brandon thats bull..yes you can, cause i've seen it done many times. So, i think that Mr. Brandon better redo that question again with a better answer to his readers cause thats misleading. Other than that, the book is very good and well worth the time.	2003-05-28

Eventhough, there were some really interesting recipes, the book wasn't what i thought would be and i would tell readers, to stick with \\"The Complete book of incense, oils and brews\\" by Cunningham. I found some of the sources within the book sometimes misleading to the readers, such as, \\"never store herbs in plastic containers cause \\"they will bleed\\"?...huh?..have you ever hear of a \\"food saver\\". Well that depends, what plastic are we talking about?, cause not all \\"plastics\\" do that like the food saver and hard plastics. Then saying \\"herbs will last two to three years\\"...huh?..thats misleading too. Some of the best herb companys that sell their herbs have told me sometimes ten or more years are still good if kept well in dry place. Then, there is Musk Root?..answer no such thing, Musk oil..yes!, but, musk root..maybe on mars (if im wrong, then you tell me, cause that would be a first that i've heard of). However, i do think the book has some decent stuff..but, not worth the money nor the time.	2003-05-27

There are so many words that i can use to say how truly i miss Cunningham's work (because of his passing to summerland). There will never be another writer of the Craft such as he. This book is a true, true classic and another reason why beginners should always start with Cunningham books first. I dubbed him as the &quot;common sense witch&quot; because of his easy way of no B.S. within his books and for being so straight forward in his words. If you are in the Craft and truly love the great outdoors, then this book will boost your level in what you need to know. I highly recommend this book greatly.	2003-05-23

When i got the book the first parts of the book were very interesting, however, had problems of the author talking about the so called &quot;mainstream&quot; towards the craft, which was kinda sick, cause after reading books from authors that she interviewed its really hard to believe in what they say. The true interviews that  enjoyed the most were the ones by Trish Telesco (gotta root for the home town hero :) ), Raven Grimassi, Raymond Buckland, and Lady Sabrina and many others, cause these folks truly write in what they say in thier books.<BR>The ones that i had to roll my eyes up and say &quot;whatever&quot; were authors she interviewed like A.J.Drew (cause after &quot;wicca for couples&quot;, you cannot believe anything this guy says anymore), Phyllis Currot (which her book of shadows was a really great book, her lack of ethics in &quot;witch crafting&quot; were awful) and last, but, not least of the worst of the interviews Silver Ravenwolf (just read her books and you'll know why).These folks dont truly live by thier own words, instead, they either point the blame towards what is wrong with wicca..like the reader is stupid or something or they tell you how wicca &quot;should be&quot; and think that you should do it this way, cause thier way is the right way..thinking that the reader doesnt think for them self, this is what some of the interviewed authors (the worst ones she interviewed anyways) believe in the books that they write only in hopes that you will too. Anyways, i wouldn't bother with this book unless you want endless hours of &quot;how i found out that i was a witch..ummmm i lit a match!&quot; or something stupid like that, save your money and buy something better.	2003-05-05

When i first picked out this book, i thought i was picking up something informative and useful, instead, i got the bizarre and bad taste in the mouth. What can you say about this book, that doesnt stick to the subject \\"wicca for couples\\"?, when all you really get is four chapters of rant and rave.<br />I thought that the tribute to Tempest Storm was pretty good, however, i think that Drew overkilled it just a tad on the subject. I am always hurt to hear the tragic death of a child, but, i guess im one of those folks that say \\"where were her parents?\\". Also, i had to laugh when Drew says \\"would you like fries with your McWicca?\\"...reason i thought it was funny is that Drew is in the same category of the rest of the wiccans that sell thier books or items in thier \\"pagan\\" shops...go figure, and when Drew says look at other wicca books in what they are saying, but rather what they are not saying...i had to laugh, cause Drew as to look at this book and i say..yeah, tell me about it.<br />I still havent found anything on \\"wicca for couples\\", which i bought the book for, because, he hasn't gotten to the subject yet. Another thing, Drew talks about \\"how he wishes more love was in wicca\\" and yet cant return \\"love\\" when he bashes other wiccan authors. I found Mr. Buckland's name so many times in the book, i figure, why dont we just call the book \\"i hate Buckland\\" cause i swear its almost in every page, and when did Mr. Buckland called himself \\" the pope\\" of witches?...Drew did you fall and hit your head?. Yet still i dont see the subject \\"wicca for couples\\" yet.<br />Then Drew starts how he really hates \\"books with spells\\"...well no kidding Drew, we all do, but get use to it as long there is a market for it..its here to stay, however, Drew forgets his own little project \\"wicca spellcraft for men\\"...my how the mind forgets lol.<br />Then to make matters worse, he gets into the personal life of Farrar/Farrar...do i really want to know about someones personal life?...no not really, yet he still not talking about \\"wicca for couples\\". However, i did agree on one thing that he talked about by saying that too many folks are looking for covens, and too many wiccans have become solitary, which he cant see how wicca religion can become a \\"fertility\\" or \\"growth\\" religion and i truly agree, but, i think folks have the right to choose what comforts them, not everyone is into covens.<br />Furthermore, this book that i thought would be useful ..truly isnt at all. Chapters one through four are just wasted paper on how wicca is and how it should be and who is to blame. Drew, what i really want to know is where is \\"wicca for couples\\", you really dont get into the subject till chapter 5...geees. You know, the last four chapters could have helped people, but, instead we get your rant and rave.<br />As Dorthy Morrison said about Drew's book here is \\"this is A.J. Drew at his best\\"...it is!..dang!..then i say id hate to see his worst.he still not talking about \\"wicca for couples\\". However, i did agree on one thing that he talked about by saying that too many folks are looking for covens, and too many wiccans have become solitary, which he cant see how wicca religion can become a \\"fertility\\" or \\"growth\\" religion and i truly agree, but, i think folks have the right to choose what comforts them, not everyone is into covens.<BR>Furthermore, this book that i thought would be useful ..truly isnt at all.

The book is well rounded and most subjects are in complete thought make them easy to understand about Paganism. However, i have to disagree on the subject of what they would call &quot;diterminism&quot;, the book said that many pagans dont believe in the idea, however, i say they are wrong because of many pagans that i came across with that live over seas see it differently, because most of these countries live in certain laws that dont give them that choice because they dont have the freedom that we do and i didnt think the book went deeper in the subject. Also, i think the book goes into too many scientific subjects that are or maybe meaningless to pagans. However, i think that the exercises such as key to success, questions to discuss, my journal ect. are very, very helpful and i think that makes the book. Also, i do like the way the book speaks about magick, which i thought was strange, however, very understandable. However, i like the way they talk about the wiccan rede and the threefold law, which i thought it was about time someone stood up for it. Other than that, its a highly recommend book.	2003-04-25

Whats great about the book is that Gardner puts himself into the book. Also another note, this book is the first time he mentions his own BOS within the book. Whats hard about the book, is the wording of &quot;old world language&quot;, so, you'll have to read it slow.

The only problem about this book is that it was very hard to get into, and at times it had very complex subjects at times. Also, the book drags as well and Mr. Bonewits beats around the bush too much with way too many scientific terms at times, which i thought he should of gotten to the point. However, this book is very well worth your time.

I give you that this book is good, cause it has alot of info and rituals that i've never even read before, the text of the book is poor and with lots of spelling mistakes (what book isn't anymore).

This book is a huge must and it might be better than big blue?, cause of all the clutter thats in big blue, this book untwist it all for those that can understand wicca a bit more better. Yes!, big blue is very good book and one of the best, however, i think this book narrows it all down for you in a simple way. Remember before you rate it..please read it FIRST. Believe me, you will be impressed and will want more.	2003-02-28

While the author has some wonderful excercises in expanding and deepening your journey into Wicca, one can help but feel a little misguided. She talks about how the concept of the ThreeFold Law is outdated, inappropriate and inaccurate. Ok, that's the way that she feels. But it sounds like she's slapping people such as Gerald Gardner in the face. Is it outdated? Maybe. But it is no more outdated than the Qabalistic ritual that makes up most of Wiccan ritual. While it's true that the ThreeFold Law isn't Wiccan, that doesn't mean that it doesn't belong in Wicca. After all, isn't the Qabalah a part of Judaism and Hebrew philosophy?<br />Her idea of \\"What's wrong with the ThreeFold Law\\" is just not represented right. What's actually wrong with the ThreeFold Law isn't what it's about or what it represents, but the way in which people who aren't educated in that field interpret it and relate it to others. If you don't know what it is you're talking about or don't understand it, of course you're going to end up misrepresenting it. I just think she could have spent a little more time researching Judaic magickal systems and philosopy before she wrote those pages, and a little less time making those like Gardner and Valiente (after all, she did edit his Book of Shadows)look like utter fools. Yes, even they were prone to mistakes. But if they felt that something such as the ThreeFold Law were inappropriate to Wicca, I'm sure that they were intelligent enough to have left it out.	2003-02-22

However, there are some confusions that are made as well. In order to read this book, you must read it more than just once to truly understand what Anton Lavey is really talking about, and you also must have an &quot;open mind&quot;. Anybody that thinks the book is &quot;rubbish&quot; or &quot;BS&quot;..should look some where else to find a path they want to travel. The book also focuses that you DO NOT have to be Satanic in order to understand what is inside the writings of this book, just be aware what is around you as a whole and that is all.	2001-10-10
