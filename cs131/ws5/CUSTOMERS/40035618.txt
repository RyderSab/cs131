We have the power of life, but the fear of death; the potential for hope and the despair--thank you Soren Kierkegaard--of the eternal.  This book fleshes out the counterpoints to the talking piints of the current intellectuo-spiritual paradigm.<br />A new benchmark has been reached, but the question is always will we just merely consider the ideals or go foreward withe the fellowship?	2002-11-27

Bill does the same thing in his book.<br />McKeever founded Mormonism Research Ministry in 1979 out of compassion for those spiritually lost in the Mormon faith.his book is well written. Bill McKeever gives answers to many of the questions our Mormon neighbors ask. He does so in an easy-to-follow way and he expresses an attitude of respect.  The next book in line is Questions to Ask your Mormon Friend. But that's a different review!<br /> believe McKeever's main purpose is to help Christians to defend their faith in the face of Mormons' thought-provoking questions. However, his love and concern for the eternal destination of Mormons shines through in his answers to their questions, as he redirects Mormons back to Biblical truths. Each Mormon question is answered by a Christian response, quoting the appropriate Biblical references. I didn't find the book to be sensational in any way whatsoever. It dealt with the Mormon \\"errors\\" in a sensitive manner.<br />Christians should read this book to realize that there are answers to Mormons' questions and to avoid being tongue-tied in potential witnessing situations with Mormons. Mormons should read McKeever's answers to give them food for a thoughtful evaluation of their own beliefs.   This book should be the first book any Evangelical Christian should buy when it comes to the Mormon faith. It is true to the Biblical passage that says \\"Always provide an answer to everyone who asks\\" and it does it in a gentle and respectful way.<br />This was the book that led me out of the chains of Mormonism and into the Christian church. The majority of Mormon \\"doctrine\\" is not contained in the Book of Mormon.  Definitely a \\"must read\\" and necessary to any Christian's library!!!	2002-10-06

The key to any battle is information, and this book fits the bill.<br />And there is so much to know about them.  They have those temples, the Book of Mormon.  I didn't know this, but they have more books in addition to the bible and their Book of Moron.  It's called the Doctrine and Covenants, and something called the pearl of great price.  My goodness, these guys really do believe in a living and modern prophet.<br />But it's all wrong.  We don't need one.  We are happy with our Bible, and we don't need any more Bible.

It is one of the best-footnoted books-probably the only footnoted book-on the magic worldview of Mormonism.  It is marvelous that Dr. Quinn is doing all of this digging to find these gems in the dirt, and finely polishing them in the light of truth.<br />He has hit upon the key to Mormonism, fantastic growth: the magic worldview.  It is surprising after reading all 700 pages of this book that people have not hit upon this key sooner.  We have been deceived by the bogus Spaulding Manuscript, by the Sydney Rigdon Decoy, and by Fawn Brodie's \\"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill\\" psycho interpretation of Joseph Smith.  That goodness we have gotten to the bottoms of things.  And this finality was reached with all the scholarly assurance.<br />You can image that having magic would be key to everything that Mormons do.  I even heard that they have done one of their baptismal orgies for the dead for Harry Houdini.  What took them so long?<br />You can see why Mormonism has become the fastest growing religion in America.  You have the magic along with their pseudo-gospel.  If you have ever been to a boring service, the attraction is apparent, even to the blind.  You pull a rabbit out of the communion chalice, and we are quite impressed.  It's like what Bono said about the Catholic Church being the religion of rock and roll.  They certainly know how to entertain.  And now the Mormons are outstripping even them.<br />Kudos for D. Quinn in organizing and researching this book.  Everything makes perfect sense now!	2002-09-19

Shakespeer is nmot on trial--you are on trial becasue he is the best.<br />I think the key is that everyone rips him off--Ethan Hawke, Mel Gibson, stanley tucci, and Alley Mac Beel all copy him with their films.<br />SO buy this book and be edified.	2002-09-13
