Never having heard of Diana Cooper before, \\"A Little Light on the Spiritual Laws\\" came as a very pleasant surprise when I first came across it a few years ago. I have re-read it several times since.<br /><br />The book is divided in to 4 sections entitled \\"The Basic Laws Of Life\\", \\"The Laws Of Creation\\", \\"The Laws Of Higher Awareness\\" and \\"The Laws Of Higher Frequency\\". There is clear, practical advice on just about anything you can think of. The affirmations and aphorisms at the end of each chapter are spot on e.g. \\"The Universe arranges itself to bring you what you believe\\", \\"Our aim is to balance all aspects of our lives\\", \\"Count your blessings and watch them multiply\\". Even though I had come across many of the ideas and suggestions before, they are presented in a fresh and dynamic context here.<br /><br />Some of the suggested links between life events and illnesses and their corresponding spiritual messages, as in the style of Louise Hay, seem a bit too far-fetched. Similarly, Diana's style of belief in angels doesn't quite ring true for me. Almost, but not quite. Maybe I have something to learn?<br /><br />Overall, an excellent and uplifting book with a beautiful cover too.	2005-04-02

From the first few moving and thought-provoking pages onwards, Holden asks us to delve deeper into what the meaning of the word \\"success\\" really is.<br /><br />Unlike some of the more American approaches to self-improvement (of which I am also a fan), the author asks us and society to slow down and look into ourselves. With sections such as \\"Money Is Not Your Purpose\\" and \\"Insane Busyness\\", the crazy rush of the busy busy modern western consumer society is questioned throughout. Many real life stories of individuals adopting more intelligent and balanced strategies for success are scattered throughout the book. There are suggestions and exercises at the end of each section.<br /><br />The seven main parts of \\"Success Intelligence\\" are Vision, Potential, Wisdom, Relationships, Courage, Grace and Renaissance. At the end the reader is asked to say \\"yes\\" to life, yourself, your wisdom, relationships, a purpose, commitment and love. A book to read, re-read, ponder on and put into practice. Thank you Robert.	2005-03-25

There is insight and wisdom on every page. 25 years after someone first leant me a copy, it seems to have more relevance to life's fundamental challenges than ever.<br /><br />Kahlil Gibran tells the story of Almastafa's departure from the city of Orphalese. As he leaves, the prophet (Almastafa) shares his thoughts on just about every aspect of the human experience. \\"Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding\\", \\"Work is love made visible\\", \\"And think not that you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course\\".<br /><br />However \\"The Prophet\\" is much more than a few inspiring self-help quotes. More a case of some of the deepest Eastern wisdom, universally applicable to the human condition. Long may it continue to inspire countless numbers of people around the world.	2005-03-25

Books	5	7	19	N	N	Intelligent analysis of an important question	Written in response to the events of September 11th, this is a fascinating and deep exploration of America's position in the world today. It is worth re-reading several times to digest all the points made. How does America see other nations and cultures? How do they see America? How does America see itself? With an academic slant (due to the background of the authors), the origins and context of contemporary American political, economic and cultural power are examined.<br /><br />Chapters 5 and 6 explore the founding myths and narratives of America. The American hero has always been a man with a gun. The taming or removal of \\"primitive\\" Native Americans can be seen as the start of America's modern foreign policy. In the last chapter, four main objections to America are suggested e.g. \\"The US has simply made it too difficult for other people to exist\\". America alone defines democracy, justice, freedom, terrorism, fundamentalism, \\"In short, what it means to be human\\". The authors call on America to look critically at itself and its position in relation to the rest of the world. As many visitors to the US have experienced first hand, Americans are almost totally insulated from non-American cultures.<br /><br />This book is not about simplistic judgements or condemnations, the authors quote many Americans who of course express great vision and compassion. The issues are complex. The problems between America and the rest of the world are essentially the same as within America itself, and to some extent the whole of the developed world which continues a love-hate relationship with many things American.<br /><br />\\"Why Do People Hate America?\\" is potentially a very important book for our times. \\"The key to a viable and sane future for us all lies in transcending hatred\\". In the words of English songwriter Morrissey, \\"America, your head's too big... I love you\\".	2005-03-16

An absolutely incredible quantity and quality of self-improvement strategies are packed into this powerful inspirational book. This is one of those books that you can dip into over and over again for a quick mental or emotional boost. Just about every page contains an immediately applicable suggestion or strategy for changing your life for the better. Countless examples of famous and successful people who have used these principles are featured. There's also some great cartoons!<br /><br />On the other hand, if you have been exploring and attempting to live these kind of ideas through authors such as Anthony Robbins and Wayne Dyer for a few years, there may not be much new here for you. In fairness, Canfield does acknowledge the influence of such writers throughout this excellent book. He has combined the best of many previous (mainly American) self-development, success, and spiritual writers with original material to come up with a fresh contemporary package.<br /><br />Some may find this book a bit materialistic and a bit \\"me me me\\" in places. Personally, many of the ideas here have helped me in every area of my life, including my work as a nurse and musician, neither of which are chiefly concerned with accumulating massive material wealth.<br /><br />Grab hold of the stuff you can relate to, give it a try, and keep working at it! A brilliant book. Thanks Jack.	2005-02-26

Other topics include reincarnation in multiple lifetimes across the space-time continuum (Star Trek and science fiction fans will enjoy this), communication with spirits, and highly evolved civilizations.

The writing is of exceptional quality, his popular blend of scientific objectivity and poetic mysticism. It feels strongly as though the author was himself  undergoing a major personal re-birth while writing \\"The Book Of Secrets\\".<br /><br />Each chapter is given to a \\"secret\\" such as \\"The Mystery Of Life Is Real\\", \\"The World Is In You\\", \\"What You Seek You Already Are\\", \\"Evil Is Not Your Enemy\\" and \\"The Meaning Of Life Is Everything\\". At the end of each chapter Deepak gives some exercises and suggestions as to how one might accommodate the secret just discussed. Many of these boil down to simple honest and open awareness of oneself and others, together with practical advice of one kind or another. For example, in chapter 6 the author helps free you up from the fear of making mistakes. Right and wrong decisions are mental constructs, there is bad in the good choices we have made and vice versa.<br /><br />On the cover Deepak asks three questions: \\"Who am I?\\", \\"Where did I come from?\\" and \\"Why am I here?\\". He answers them clearly and simply in the last chapter. A great book to help you WAKE UP!	2004-12-27

The spirit of Bill Hicks lives on. Over ten years after his death, some may feel that we need his vision, sanity and humour more than ever. This book is a great reminder of just how brilliant and hysterically funny he was. Several recordings of live performances are also available on c.d.<br /><br />Relentlessly, Bill rips into the hypocrisy and ridiculousness of much of so-called civilization with astonishing wit and intelligence. \\"I am available for children's parties\\", quips Bill after another story involving topics such as pornography or drugs. Other targets include religion (\\"God, I pray the Christians get the message soon\\"), America (\\"There is freedom of speech to the highest bidder\\"), and global economics and poverty (\\"Take all that money that we spend on weapons and defence each year, and instead spend it feeding, clothing and educating the poor of the world\\").<br /><br />But however political or controversial Bill gets, you sense that here is a loving but troubled soul with an open mind and an open heart. A man who desperately wanted to see more truth, laughter, love, compassion and understanding in the world. God bless the Spirit of Bill Hicks.	2004-12-26

Although there is a practical bias towards the business world of advertising and media, this book is likely to appeal to any individual who is interested in creativity and thinking for themselves. It is beautifully designed and very entertaining.<br /><br />In the first few pages, Paul Arden encourages you to set your goals high and aim beyond what you believe you are capable of. Then there are \\"The Fundamentals\\" such as \\"Do not seek praise. Seek criticism\\", \\"Give away everything you know, and more will come back to you\\", \\"Don't promise what you can't deliver\\". My favourite is \\"It's right to be wrong\\", where Arden points out how anything is possible when you're not trying to be right. The risk is greater, you are in the unknown, but \\"there's more chance of it being amazing\\".<br /><br />A combination of \\"common sense\\", awareness, business advice, communication skills, positive thinking, a few presentation tricks and some quirky strokes of genius. Great stuff.	2004-12-26

Having read most of the subsequent Conversations With God series by Walsch and God over the last few years, I have just come back to this first in the series. It is still fascinating reading 5 years on. Profound, funny, intelligent, compassionate and deeply thought provoking.<br /><br />God here is the sanest, most honest, most credible God I have ever come across by a long way. Beginning in this book, the dialogue between Walsch and God deals with EVERY possible aspect of the human condition in an intelligent and constructive fashion. All of life and human experience is embraced, and I mean ALL OF LIFE!<br /><br />Although this book can definitely stand alone, I recommend \\"The New Revelations\\", \\"Tomorrow's God\\", and \\"Friendship With God\\" in the series, all of which explore the possible personal, social, economic and political implications of the ideas discussed. I am not in complete agreement with all of it, but its brilliant stuff. Sincere thanks again Neale.	2004-04-12

As the author journeys through the houses, there are profound psychological insights for both the beginner and the more experienced astrologer.<br />The format is straightforward. An introductory section (&quot;a person's reality springs outward from his or her inner landscape of thoughts, feelings, expectations and beliefs&quot;), a quick journey through the houses, and then on to the majority of the book which is given over to a &quot;cookbook&quot; treatment of all the planets and signs in each house. There are countless examples backing up the interpretations e.g. writers and communicators with Sun in the third house, a famous musician and a poet with Neptune in the tenth house and so on.<br />At the end of the book there is a handy summary of the key concepts for each house, and a look at the different house systems astrologers use. Sasportas finishes the main text with the question, &quot;Why don't you become what only you can become?&quot;. Why not indeed!? An excellent book.	2004-04-12

If you have heard or suspected that there is a great deal more to it than the newspaper columns, this book is a good place to begin finding out more. Rae Orion explains the basics and complexities of the birth chart (a proper horoscope is based on the exact time, date and place of birth) in a clear, straightforward manner.<br />In &quot;The Cosmic Cookbook&quot; section, Orion takes the reader through the basics of birth chart interpretation. Sun signs, Moon signs, the positions of all the planets in the various signs and houses e.g. Mars in Aquarius, Uranus in the sixth house and so on. Real life examples are scattered throughout the book. Other sections cover basic compatibility, both Sun sign combinations and more complex relationship astrology.

Having read nearly all the CWG series myself, and some of them several times, I am completely biased in their favour. They are spiritual sanity and hope in an often mad world.<br />Walsch and God's re-defining of God in the opening chapters is contemporary, clear, profound, spiritual wisdom, building on previous themes in the CWG series. Some possible social, economic and political consequences of embracing such a God are explored towards the end of the book. Much of this is brilliantly inspirational, even if you don't agree with all of it.<br />Some religious fundamentalists still seem to feel threatened by the CWG ideas. Yet again Walsch is quite clear here about us EMBRACING all that works in existing religions. &quot;Not a replacement for the old, but an enhancement of it. Not an abandonment of your present religions, but a revitalization of them&quot;. &quot;BE  THE  HOPE  OF  HUMANITY&quot;, say Neale and God at one point, inspiring this reader considerably!	2004-04-09

On the other hand there is a great deal of wisdom and insight on relationships and sexuality that almost anyone could benefit from. The first few sections in particular are full of profound and accessible psychological wisdom, this being augmented by an increasing number of examples and case histories as the book progresses.<br />Tyl draws on his obviously massively extensive practical experience as an astrological counsellor throughout this superb book. A whole range of happy and unhappy relationship case histories are explored. Every possible intimacy issue is covered, no stone is left unturned! How can we express our deepest feelings to one another without fear of criticism, rejection or abandonment? Tyl explores the ongoing disappointments and crises most of us experience, even in fundamentally healthy relationships, as expectations and dreams are shattered, or \\"bubbles are burst\\" as he puts it.<br />To his great credit, Noel Tyl includes his own chart and some of his own relationship experiences here. How could an author with  Sun conjunct Jupiter in Capricorn in 7th, and Mercury in Capricorn in 8th, do anything else but write authoritatively on the realities of relationships and intimacy!?	2004-04-01

This time the emphasis is on meaningful achievement and what it takes to be successful, what it takes to live out one's full potential while simultaneously enriching the lives of others. Depending on your personal definition of &quot;success&quot;, there are many inspirational role models covered here, financial success often  playing an important part.<br />Butler-Bowdon's style is balanced, intelligent and insightful. In the case of the few authors and books I had already read, the &quot;in a nutshell&quot; comments were precise and accurate e.g. &quot;Success leaves clues, but they must be acted on&quot; for Anthony Robbins and Unlimited Power. The biographical notes on a wide range of characters including John Paul Getty, Henry Ford, Michael Dell and Nelson Mandela make very interesting reading.<br />It could be said that this book deals more with the external aspects of personal fulfillment, with an American emphasis on business leadership and financial success as a path to fulfilling personal potential. By contrast Butler-Bowdon's  previous volume dealt more with inner fulfillment and spiritual values. I personally am drawn more to the latter, but there can of course be considerable crossover between the two, with Stephen Covey (The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People) and Anthony Robbins featuring in both books.

Well yes, reading this book does rather feel like that much of the time. \\"Das Energi\\" is a mighty powerful and inspirational read. A dynamic (VERY dynamic) mix of Zen ideas, taoism, positive thinking and maybe a bit of Christian morality thrown in for good measure. However, some of the language does place the book firmly in the late sixties and early seventies (man!). Its still brilliant.<br /><br />Paul Williams presents us with quick, sharp \\"blows to the head\\" such as \\"Beware means be aware.\\", \\"Vote with your life. Vote yes.\\", \\"Stop showing off.

The uneven format of the book (could be a sentence on one page, a short paragraph on the next, then a short essay on the next) helps you to think more consciously in itself.<br /><br />Having read the book several times over, I finally realized what was missing for me. A sense of humour! An inspirational classic such as \\"Illusions\\" by Richard Bach for example, has the same enlightening quality but gives you a good chuckle too. Still, this is an extraordinary book and I thank Paul Williams for it wholeheartedly. Read this and WAKE UP! ;o)	2004-03-21

Below each is a space for personal thoughts or whatever else the reader chooses to write. Breaking the wisdom down into small &quot;daily meditations&quot; means you can ponder on the ideas and insights without having to read the original book properly!<br />Since I first discovered the CWG books in the late nineties, hardly a month has gone by without me dipping into one or another of the series. Although I personally have not used this book in the way prescribed as I already keep a diary, I have folded the pages of my favourite quotes to glance at occasionally e.g. &quot;You call forth precisely what you think, feel and say&quot; (January 17th), &quot;The young people are destroying your way of life. The young people have always done that. Your job is to encourage it. Not discourage it&quot; (July 24th) &quot;All attack is a call for help&quot; (September 29th) and so on.<br />The Conversations With God books, including this one, are contemporary spiritual sanity, clarity and hope for the future. I am completely biased in their favour. If you want other perspectives on the books, have a read of the reviews by some religious fundamentalists who feel that the writings of Neale Donald Walsch are lacking or even some kind of blasphemy.<br />Thanks again Neale.	2004-03-21

The strength of this book is its powerful simplicity. Many of the ideas, suggestions and techniques can be found elsewhere in many other popular self-help writings, but Jinny Ditzler's approach inspires action almost effortlessly. Compared to other similar books, it is almost impossible to read this without making at least one or two of her lists which then empowers you to make positive life changes.<br />A criticism might be that it is fairly basic stuff that we know already, but answering the various lists of questions here brings new clarity and confidence about what is going on, or not going on, in one's life. Parts one and two are preparation for &quot;the ten best year yet questions&quot; in part three. These are basically all about looking honestly at your life, seeing clearly what works and what doesn't, then setting clear and specific goals in different areas over the next 12 months.<br />If, like me, you are someone who loves reading these kind of books but finds that it often seems to take rather a lot of hard work to put the ideas into practice, I recommend Your Best Year Yet! Inevitably I did not achieve some of my goals for the last 12 months, but the considerable improvements I did make (plus increased clarity about goals for the future) were partly due to getting a realistic focus from this book.	2003-10-10

Over 20 years old, this book still remains one of the modern classics that no contemporary astrologer can afford to be without. Just about every serious astrologer I've ever met has got a copy of this on his or her shelf.<br />For most of the book, Robert Hand explores the meaning of every possible combination of planets in transit to each other, this being one of the most commonly used techniques of astrological prediction. In addition to the planets, the ascendant and midheaven are also included but astrologers using Chiron will have to look elsewhere. The introductory chapters about the interpretation and timing of transits are well worth a read, and these are followed by a case study of Nixon and the Watergate scandals in the early 1970s. Then its on to a chapter for each planet and the transits it makes to all the others.<br />Hand's interpretations are full of psychological insights, but the nature of specific events that may occur are also covered. For the first few years I had this book I tended to focus on the more obvious long-term transits of the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) but eventually I became just as intrigued by the uncanny accuracy of the &quot;insignificant&quot; daily or even hourly transits of the Sun, the Moon and Mercury. The smallest and the largest life cycles have their part to play.<br />Buy this book and prove or disprove predictive astrology for yourself!	2003-10-08

Surely Neale and God had said it all, and the cynic in me noted that the print is larger this time i.e. there's less in it.<br />But Mr. Walsch and God strike again! The three sections on holistic living, relationships, and abundance and right livelihood are all full of excellent little anecdotes, stories, practical suggestions and a few corny jokes ;o) that derive from the wisdom of the previous books. Much is familiar but as the author observes, &quot;if even one comment opens a new window or throws wide a doorway to greater happiness, you will have been served&quot;. It more than did this for me.<br />The ideas and perspectives on relationships, money (&quot;money's only value is when it leaves your hand&quot;), sex, nurturing mind-body-spirit simultaneously and love are well worth repeated reading and add to the store of practical wisdom in the Conversations With God books as a whole.	2003-10-07

Although I had read many of the featured authors already, there is such a broad range in the chosen 50 that I suspect most other seasoned self-help readers would benefit as I did. For beginners and those curious about the self-help publishing phenomenon, this could indeed be &quot;the only self-help book you will ever need&quot; as they say!<br />The brief summaries of each book and writer are balanced, intelligent and insightful. The &quot;in a nutshell&quot; comments are invariably accurate e.g. &quot;When you are aligned with your higher self and your life purpose, miraculous things happen&quot; for &quot;Real Magic&quot; by Wayne Dyer. Butler-Bowdon also presents the case for and against each book and writer, being more obviously critical of some than others, but remaining open and balanced with his objective assessments.<br />The inclusion of the Bible, the Bhagavad-Gita and Benjamin Franklin's autobiography stretches the &quot;self-help&quot; genre beyond obvious modern writers and adds depth. 50 more books are recommended at the end. Excellent, thanks Tom!	2003-10-07

Although I discovered this after many years of involvement with astrology, I was immediately impressed by how much high quality information is packed into this one volume. There is a deep understanding and wisdom here that goes way beyond many other first class introductory texts. In fact it is as much for advanced astrologers as it is for beginners.<br />The very first chapter, &quot;The Horoscope: A Map of the Psyche&quot; lays some philosophical foundations that every astrologer could do well to take on board, especially in the area of personal choice and how we create our reality. From then on it's an inspired journey through all the features of a birth chart. Scientific, historical and psychological perspectives are all considered as Hand works his way through the planets, aspects, mid-points and signs of the zodiac, all in depth. The section on the houses is one of the most complete summaries I have ever seen in print, each house being assessed on internal, relational and external levels.<br />Like Hand's classic &quot;Planets In Transit&quot;, &quot;Horoscope Symbols&quot; will continue to make its mark for many years to come. I highly recommend it.	2003-10-07

And I for one still benefit hugely from the SANITY AND CLARITY of this writing, especially after September 11th.<br />After so many books in the Conversations With God series, thoughts of &quot;re-hash for a bit more money in the bank&quot; almost inevitably cross one's mind, but this is inappropriate and unnecessarily cynical. Yes the message is always basically the same, but as I am a big big fan of all the books I am completely biased in their favour!<br />In The New Revelations the dialogue with God revolves around the crisis of humanity on Earth today, with the underlying main theme being that a spiritual crisis is the fundamental cause of our individual and collective problems. God and Neale suggest that our deepest beliefs must be changed before our behaviour can change. Organized religion takes a bit of a hammering here, although as always in the CWG books there is an embracing of the best of traditional religion while suggesting some fundamental shifts that need to be made if humanity is to survive and prosper.<br />Virtually all the Big Religious Books (Bible, Qur'an etc.) are quoted to demonstrate how man has created God in his own image, a creation which is then used to justify condemning or killing others who hold different beliefs to one's own.	2003-10-07

There is minimal theorizing and a large number of day to day examples of how to deal positively with potentially difficult and stressful situations e.g. passing your driving test, arguments, insomnia, self-assertiveness, loneliness, and so on. Much of it we may know already but Vera Peiffer leaves you inspired by spelling out the positive thinking solutions and strategies so clearly.<br />Peiffer suggests that the quality of your thoughts determines the quality of your life and that whatever you send out to others comes back like a boomerang. With this in mind, long and short versions of affirmations are scattered throughout the book and every so often there are underlined notes such as &quot;never give up&quot;, &quot;things are meant to go right&quot;, &quot;a person who is interested is interesting&quot; and &quot;whatever you spend a lot of time thinking about will become bigger&quot;. After reading the last quote you suddenly get a lot more careful about what you are thinking about!<br />An excellent book full of useful reminders.	2003-10-06

The co-author of The Celestine Prophecy Experiential Guide has put together this excellent collection of suggestions, ideas and true life stories to inspire one to find one's higher purpose, and a jolly good job it does! It is interesting, well-written and entertaining throughout, with each chapter finishing with a few straightforward questions and exercises to move you on in the right direction. Part three, &quot;deep water&quot;, deals masterfully with the darker and more difficult experiences one sometimes has while trying to connect more deeply with the soul's purpose.<br />A major theme is developing an awareness of synchronicity (meaningful co-incidence) experiences as guiding posts for deeper personal development. There are a large number of interviews with people from a wide range of backgrounds, all of whom have come to find their unique purpose through such ideas. Quotes from the famous such as the Dalai Lama and Frank Zappa (!), and not so famous are also highlighted throughout the text e.g.&quot;intuition is the creative, universal intention expressing through you&quot; and &quot;either I am lost, crazy and screwed up, or I am found and on a difficult part of the path&quot;.<br />I found the chapter on &quot;the void&quot; particularly supportive, especially the section on &quot;holding your centre during confusion, chaos and fear&quot;. Carol Adrienne is not afraid to explore the sometimes harsh realities of the spiritual journey, but the book is essentially upbeat and positively inspirational.	2003-10-06

The message here is clear. Reclaim your power and creativity by actively embracing the sides of yourself you deny or dislike. Rather than waste time and energy condemning others, look at yourself for possible faults you may be finding in those around you. In this context, being a whole person is more important than being a &quot;good&quot; person. Being &quot;spiritual&quot; means being fully human, warts and all!<br />Many examples are given throughout of how judging others negatively is in fact a mirror for one's own perceived negative personality traits. Positive qualities are also often projected onto others and we can reclaim these too. By accepting the whole truth about ourselves we can move forward with a greater sense of self-worth and more love to give to others.<br />&quot;Do you really want inner peace?&quot; asks Debbie Ford, &quot;If you do its yours. Surrender. Stop fighting. Stop defending. Stop pretending. Stop denying. Stop lying to yourself&quot;. Overall this is a powerful read in the territory of the &quot;Conversations With God&quot; books by Neale Donald Walsch who contributes an introduction here. As with many books of this nature, the challenge is to consistently LIVE these ideas!	2002-07-17

There are so many psychological perspectives on relationships and life in general that I suspect everyone can find something here to inspire them. The layout of 366 statements with corresponding explanations and exercises is accessible and easy to dip into for a spot of inspiration or guidance now and again.<br />&quot;A Course In Miracles&quot; is acknowledged as a major influence by the author and many of his ideas have that flavour about them. As someone who struggled with A.C.I.M. I am always grateful to come across similar profound wisdom in a more digestible form. Thank you Chuck!<br />Some examples... &quot;Intimacy can heal anything&quot;, &quot;Forgiveness changes perception&quot;, &quot;Every fantasy is an expectation&quot;, &quot;A bad feeling is released by true giving&quot;, &quot;Everyone's actions reflect my choices&quot;, &quot;The ultimate goal is total dependence on the universe&quot;, &quot;I can be in heaven with every person I meet&quot;, &quot;Commitment means being true to myself&quot;, &quot;Every expectation is a fear of the future&quot;.

As in his other writings, Robert Anton Wilson entertains and challenges with intelligence and wit in The New Inquisition. Wilson takes the reader on a philosophical, scientific and linguistic journey, shattering expectations and preconceptions along the way, leaving one feeling that nothing is completely real and that everything is possible. Or something like that. What is this &quot;reality&quot; thing anyway!?<br />Wilson argues for creative agnosticism in all areas of thinking and ideology. Models are regarded as &quot;tools to be used only and always where appropriate and replaced (by other models) only and always where not appropriate&quot;. All forms of dogmatic thinking are cleverly undermined with irreverent humour and intelligence, Wilson continually pointing out the consequences of accepting limited perception.<br />The ideas of various 20th century &quot;heretics&quot; are explored to support Wilson's insights. Wilhem Reich, Velikowsky, David Bohm, Rupert Sheldrake and Jung are just some of the original thinkers touched on. Throw in some quantum physics, UFO sightings, all manner of reported strange phenomena, a bit of Zen, and you have some idea of what this book is about. Brilliant.	2002-07-16

Astrologer Neil Spencer has put together a first class comprehensive overview of the position of astrology in contemporary Western society. It is entertaining, balanced, intelligent and often very funny. \\"Believers\\" (I am a professional astrologer myself) and \\"sceptics\\" can both benefit from reading this book.<br />Early on there is a brief  guide to the basics of astrology itself, followed by a quick look at the history of the subject over the last few hundred years. Most of the book is taken up with considerations of every possible aspect (pun intended) over the last century. The rise of newspaper horoscopes, psychological astrology as self-development, statistical evidence or lack of it, the use of astrology by the likes of Ronald Reagan and Princess Diana, successes and failures in predicting the future.<br />Spencer does a good job of exploding many popular ideas that are held by many e.g. being born on the cusp (you are actually either one sign or another) and the ever-present myth of the Age of Aquarius (highly dubious as to what it actually is). Although Spencer's own astrological input takes a back seat most of the time, countless examples of astrology in action are scattered throughout. The chart comparison between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky is an entertaining example!<br />Read this book if you REALLY want to know what astrology is all about.	2002-06-09

Not having had a course of Alexander Technique lessons myself, I still managed to gain a considerable amount of physical and mental self-awareness through reading this book, helped by a partner of mine who was having regular Alexander sessions at the time. A course of lessons from a qualified practitioner is no doubt necessary  to gain the full benefits of the Technique, but many of the ideas and suggestions from this book still remain with me several years after first coming across them. They have helped me considerably with my posture as a singer and guitarist.<br />According to F.M. Alexander, &quot;You translate everything, whether physical or mental or spiritual, into muscular tension&quot;. The Alexander Technique is a deceptively simple way of becoming more aware of the balance, posture and co-ordination of our bodies as experienced in everyday activities. It begins with basic self-awareness of how we sit, how we stand, how we think, physical and mental habits we have, and so on. From there it may be a case of re-educating ourselves through daily awareness, helped by a number of exercises with particular emphasis on the neck and spine. The aim is to &quot;regain the natural grace and balance of a child&quot;.<br />These simple ideas and exercises (which to some extent are similar to other disciplines such as yoga or meditation) have played an important part in helping me develop and sustain a healthy mind, body and spirit over the years. I recommend them.	2002-04-08

I am reluctant to criticize such an extraordinary and highly influential work, but I personally got far more out of reading (and re-reading several times!) \\"A Return To Love\\" by Marianne Williamson, a book based heavily on \\"A Course In Miracles\\". This was some years after having attempted and failed to plough systematically through A Course In Miracles on my own. I know many people have had more success working with the text in a group.<br />Nevertheless I think there is much to be gained from these extraordinary writings, even if one doesn't have the patience or determination to work through all the text as is recommended. Years after attempting to read it, several quotes have stuck inside my head e.g. \\"Heaven is the decision I must make\\", \\"In my defencelessness my safety lies\\", \\"I am never upset for the reason I think\\". It is easy to see why A Course In Miracles has been acknowledged as an influence by so many great contemporary self-development and spiritual writers and speakers e.g. Neale Donald Walsch (Conversations With God), Anthony Robbins, Chuck Spezzano.<br />I remain uncomfortable with so many references to the Son of God, the Holy Spirit, and the sheer number of words in the volumes.

Although I found this a bit slow to get going, with the opening couple of chapters surely rather obvious to most of us in the Western world these days, this is an excellent book. The  Dalai Lama carefully puts forward universal principles that can inspire all humanity in the direction of fundamental personal happiness.<br />Some Buddhist terms are used (e.g. \\"nying-je\\" = the supreme emotion of love and compassion, \\"chi-sem\\" = universal consciousness), but the author is far more interested in embracing ALL religious and non-religious perspectives. \\"Whether or not a person is a religious believer does not matter much. Far more important is that they be a good human being\\". His approach is practical too. There are countless everyday examples of possible moral and ethical choices, with clear observations and comments on the consequences. An awareness of the fundamental interconnectedness of ourselves and those around us is a major theme.<br />Through the application of moral principles to a very broad range of human experiences, the Dalai Lama inspires a practical, intelligent, spiritual awareness and sense of responsibility in the reader. The approach is balanced, rational and compassionate. Great words to be absorbed and acted upon.	2002-04-06

A very large and absolutely fantastic collection of contemporary spiritual writing put together by Lucinda Vardey. If you are interested in modern interpretations of God from EVERY religious and spiritual point of view, this is a great, BIG, introduction to a huge number of authors. Apart from anything else, you could save yourself a huge amount of time and money by buying this book!<br />Lucinda Vardey has divided the writings into 6 sections: The Quest, Revelation, Trials, Surrender, Death And The Etrernal Life, Awe, and sub-divided each of these sections into another 3 or 4 sections. I was already familiar with a handful of the huge number of masterful contributors, such as the \\"non-guru\\" Krishnamurti, physicist and Eastern mystic Fritjof Capra, rebel priest Matthew Fox, Zen writer Alan Watts, Christian and Narnia legend C.

All the possible planetary combinations are worked through one by one, giving clear guidelines as to the corresponding kind of interactions between the two individuals concerned. I have often found it very handy to pull out an occasional quote from this chapter when presenting a chart comparison. I have not seen such concise, top quality, synastry information anywhere else.<br />Otherwise, great astrology but not so sure about all the relationship advice! Written in 1958, some of the attitudes towards relationships and partnerships inevitably seem a bit out of date and rather limited e.g. many comments about the leadership of the man and the domesticity of the woman in marriage. There is still much good common sense here, even though much of it seems rather obvious at the beginning of the 21st century.<br />Another criticism is the notable absence of ascendants and midheavens in the comparison of aspects, especially as the author states quite early on, &quot;most important in judging attraction is the aspect between the ascendant of one chart and the planets of the other&quot;.	2002-04-02

Any relative newcomer to astrology would do well to check out the deep psychological perspectives offered here, subtleties that are lost by more simplistic interpretations of Saturn in the chart.<br />Perhaps in contrast to some of her work, the depth and complexity of Liz Greene remains more accessible throughout this book. The layout is straightforward, a consideration of Saturn in each of the four elements (houses and signs) that combines intelligent astrology with fascinating and practical psychological perspectives. Aspects in the chart and synastry are also covered in separate chapters.<br />One of the main themes is the Jungian idea of embracing the dark and sinister side of Saturn as necessary for healthy, holistic self-development. &quot;It is only when the Beast is loved for his own sake that he can be freed from the spell and become the Prince&quot;. Saturn asks that we take responsibility through accepting limitations, learning to use our painful experiences for growth. The approach is balanced, highly insightful with many psychological and esoteric angles covered throughout. As someone with a strong Saturn myself, I highly recommend this book! Read together with &quot;Saturn In Transit&quot; by Erin Sullivan, and you have just about everything you need to know about Saturn in modern astrology.	2002-04-01

Boldt has put together a first class selection of quotes from a wide range of famous men and women, each of them known for some kind of exceptional human achievement. As Boldt says, &quot;the diversity of the sources highlights the timeless and universal nature of these principles&quot;, so there are many Westerners quoted aswell as more traditional Zen Eastern sources.<br />The book is divided into 25 different sections, each of them covering a quality associated with the Zen tradition e.g. Be Here Now, Beginner's Mind, Responsibility, Compassion, Joy, Discipline, The Game Of Life, Selfless Service, Letting Go, Everyday Zen. There is a brief introduction to each quality, then a selection of associated quotes.<br />Many readers of self-development books and spiritual ideas will be familiar with some of these sayings, but as befits the Zen emphasis, the quality and depth of these quotes really makes an impact.

It has been one of my constant companions over the last 10 years or so, both in my work as a professional astrologer and in following my own transits of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto.<br />The first section, \\"The Collaboration with the Inevitable\\", is an excellent summary of how astrology can be used as a tool for understanding ongoing personal transformation, helping to turn perceived crises into opportunities. Sasportas then moves on to look in great detail and depth at the transits of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto to each planet in the natal chart. A very large number of case histories are dotted throughout the transit interpretations, with a wide range of examples of how each planetary combination can show up in daily life. These possible events are considered in the context of the psychological development of the individual, Sasportas drawing on his extensive knowledge of many fields of psychology, mythology and spirituality.<br />Much of the astrological material here is similar to other classic transit books such as those by Robert Hand, Betty Lundsted or Stephen Arroyo (who Sasportas acknowledges), but Sasportas has masterfully integrated a huge number of additional psychological and spiritual insights from many sources. The Gods Of Change is a wise and compassionate conribution to modern astrology.	2002-03-20

The nature of the subject and the writing quality of the seven astrologers involved (the most famous being Robert Hand) make this a very unusual  book. A very, very, very broad range of astrological and non-astrological perspectives are very carefully covered in this assessment of the terrorist attacks on America and some of the possible implications for all of us.<br />Astrologically the main emphasis is on interpretations of the charts of the events in September, together with related charts such as those of the United States, George W. Bush and, to some extent, Osama Bin Laden. Many other charts are also considered such as the World Trade Centre bombing in 1993 and the national chart for Israel. Interpretations of the Saturn-Pluto opposition transit through 2001 and 2002 receive particular attention throughout the book.<br />The astrology is continually placed in a broad context, with extensive considerations of the historical, political, and economical background to the attacks, together with similar perspectives on the consequences. Many questions are asked. Did the perpetrators use astrology? Did the terrorists intend to crash into the White House? Where do we go from here? Very occasionally some of the views appear rather fanciful, but overall this is superb stuff that does intelligent justice to modern astrology.	2002-03-20

They all essentially say the same stuff of course, but in different ways that will appeal more to some than others in each case. In this guidebook, countless examples of everyday difficulties we all experience as human beings are specifically and clearly dealt with. Do you have a resistance to eating spinach? What do you most often think about world hunger? What is the purpose of life? Brilliant!<br />The text revolves around the 34 core concepts of Book 1 which Walsch defines in the introduction. These range from &quot;God is communicating with us all the time&quot; to &quot;You need no God&quot; to &quot;To want something is to push it away from you&quot; and so on. Each of the concepts are subsequently expanded on together with text references from the original book. What makes everything really interesting are the exercises, assignments and experiments scattered throughout the book and at the end of each section. Not only are these totally practical applications of Walsch/God's wisdom, some of them are also very funny. These are suggested as possible guidelines for CWG study groups.<br />The presentation of the material is quite different to all the main books. Visually, the text is broken up by the original text references, exercises, questions and suggestions for further discussion. Its easier to dip into now and again as a result.	2001-08-08

Being a huge fan of all the Conversations With God books, I am almost reluctant to offer any kind of criticism... but I will! &quot;Communion With God&quot; is a fitting conclusion to the series, but I personally prefer the more autobiographical approach of &quot;Friendship With God&quot;, or the powerful simplicity of CWG book one. I feel they speak to me more directly than this, but read them all and decide for yourself.<br />The text here is presented as a monologue, with God speaking straight to the reader. Many of the insights have of course been presented in the previous books, but Walsch and God do present further gems here. In fact it's almost worth buying the book for the first page of the introduction alone. As with all the Conversations With God books, the writing is exceptionally enlightening and of outstanding quality. There are three sections - &quot;The Ten Illusions&quot; (need, failure, disunity, insufficiency, requirement, judgment, condemnation, conditionality, superiority, ignorance), &quot;Mastering The Illusions&quot; and &quot;Meeting The Creator Within&quot;.<br />Walsch/God ends with a call to &quot;seize the day&quot;. &quot;Begin as you awaken, by seeing yourself as Who You Really Are, by praising all that you ever have been, and all that you have become. And begin by choosing, in this moment of grace, to become more than you have ever been or ever dreamed of being...&quot; :o) ;o)	2001-08-07

The complex subtleties of both astrology and psychology are clearly explained and interwoven throughout. The style is balanced, intelligent and imaginative.<br />A key theme is that what we meet in our external reality is very much a reflection of our inner life. Liz Greene draws on both the astrological symbols of the birth chart and psychological concepts such as projection, shadow and anima/animus to outline a path towards greater understanding and increased individual responsibility. This approach to life offers an alternative to blaming our parents, partners - or even astrological birth charts - for our problems! Wisely, there are no easy answers here, but there is a great deal of insight into the human condition. Example charts and case histories are used to great effect.<br />Not everyone is a fan of Liz Greene and her psychotherapeutic perspective on astrology, but &quot;Relating&quot; is one of many major contributions that Greene has made to the cosmic science. It is well worth a read, particularly if you are relatively new to astrology. Apart from anything else, there's plenty of general advice on relationships that just about everyone can benefit from!	2001-08-07

It confirmed and expanded many of my own views on such phenomena as ESP, psychic abilities, the relationship between logic and intuition and so on. Yes, we are in &quot;X Files&quot; territiory here!<br />There are a large number of case studies quoted by Vaughan but mainly he draws on his own experiences and over 20 years worth of teaching psychic techniques. A wide range of exercises to help you test and improve your own abilities are presented at the end of each chapter, many of these taking experimental form. Vaughan talks of &quot;tapping the blueprints of life&quot; but also points out that we may need to learn to distinguish between genuine guiding visions for our best future, and &quot;strongly held fantasies&quot;. Again there are exercises offered to help do this.<br />A very wide range of related subjects are intelligently explored or touched on in this book.  &quot;The inner self puts moral restrictions on psychic perception&quot; suggests Vaughan in relation to using predictive abilities to win at gambling. Do we have the power to change an unwanted future if we see it coming? What is the relationship between fate and free will? How much of our individual and collective future can be &quot;predicted&quot; by observing the continuation of current trends and patterns? Vaughan suggests that by understanding how our mind works, we can understand how we are creating our dreams and our future. Excellent.	2001-08-07

This modern classic is a deep and profound study of the twelve houses, including interpretation guidelines for each of the planets in each house, and an exploration of all the houses together as a complete cycle of experience.<br />However, this book may not be for everyone. Rudhyar has an extraordinarily universal perspective in his writing, covering a panoramic range of sociological, scientific, philosophical, political and spiritual perspectives as he describes the houses. This is genuinely consciousness-raising in the best sense, but it does sometimes feel a bit of a struggle as Rudhyar goes off on related tangents about individual or collective destiny in the Western world, or a summary of related perspectives from a range of religions. Sometimes it is as though he attempts to embrace the totality of human experience in every sentence!<br />Stephen Arroyo has acknowledged Rudhyar as a major influence on his writings, and I tend to feel that the essence of Rudhyar is perhaps more accessible through Arroyo's excellent books. Nevertheless this is still quality stuff and well worth a read for any serious astrological student. It does need a bit of effort to get your head round it all!	2001-08-02

This is a beautiful little book for anyone curious as to what real astrology is all about. Charles and Suzi Harvey have done an excellent job in presenting an extensive and clear overview, covering every basic question that newcomers are likely to have. What is astrology? Who studies astrology? How can it help me? Can it predict the future?<br />The history of astrology up to the present day is briefly covered, and the basics of the birth chart (planets, signs of the zodiac, houses and so on) are covered in detail. The resource guide at the back is a nice touch, including web-sites and addresses for established teaching bodies.<br />The layout and illustrations in this compact little book are absolutely first class, perfectly complementing the clear, informative and imaginative text. All of the sections manage to be brief and to the point, but this clear and simple style still does justice to the depth of the subject.	2001-07-24

Robbins' intensity and commitment almost physically jump out at the reader, urging you to wake up, take control and massively improve the quality of your life and those around you. I bought this 5 or 6 years ago and continue to dip into it every so often to shake myself up a bit. Just about every page contains an immediately applicable suggestion or strategy for changing your life for the better.<br />Is it all as straightforward as he describes? My view would be yes... and no! Sometimes no amount of focusing and mind control can change some of our deep-rooted patterns? But this book is still brilliant. Many of the ideas here have improved my life.<br />Some of the ideas and techniques are very simple, some far more complicated. The concentrated power of the writing is sustained throughout as Robbins continuously emphasizes the need to commit to lasting change. Early on he suggests the importance of decisions - your decisions about what to focus on, your decisions about what things mean to you, and your decisions about what to do to create the results you desire. He distinguishes between being those who are interested in personal change and those who actually commit to making things happen.<br />Raise your standards, change your limiting beliefs, change your strategy. Ask yourself empowering questions such as &quot;what is great about this problem?&quot; or &quot;what am I excited about in my life right now?&quot;. There is a brilliant chapter on &quot;transformational vocabulary&quot; in which the author suggests that merely by changing the words we regularly use we can profoundly change our reality. As with many of the suggestions in this book, I have tried this and it works, especially if you keep working at it.	2001-07-14

It has helped me considerably over the last few years. As with all of Wayne Dyer's writing, the style is easy to read, empowering, gentle and occasionally very funny. Many of the quotes and aphorisms are worth burning into your subconscious, ready for recall at times when one feels &quot;less than empowered&quot;, or as extra positive inspiration for when things are already going well!....<br />&quot;When you argue for your limitations, all you get are your limitations&quot; &quot;Did you ever notice how difficult it is to argue with someone who is not obsessed with being right?&quot; &quot;The more you let go of people and things, the fewer obstacles you will have on your life's journey&quot; &quot;Being self-actualized means being able to welcome the unknown&quot;<br />And there's plenty more where they came from!

Richard Bach's classic is one of the very first self-development/spiritual books I ever read, and 15 years later it still compares very favourably with the best of the rest. There is profound truth and subtle humour on  nearly every page, and I strongly recommend this beautifully written book to anyone who has not come across it yet.<br />The author meets stranger and fellow pilot Donald Shimoda and the story unfolds. About a third of the way through Richard starts reading the &quot;Messiah's Handbook&quot; which is quoted liberally from then on. It contains various pearls of  wisdom.... &quot;You teach best what you most need to learn&quot;, &quot;Argue for your limitations, and sure enough, they're yours&quot; and (one of my favourites) &quot;You are never given a wish without also being given the power to make it true. You may have to work for it however&quot;.<br />The chapter where Shimoda and Richard visit the cinema to discover the meaning of life is a high point and the twist at the end of the book is absolutely brilliant.

Marianne Williamson is writing with deep compassion and obviously has considerable first-hand experience of the principles she's writing about.<br />The basic message here is that we are all perfect expressions of love, and that the energy of love and God is all there is. Anything else is an illusion. All the judgments of oneself and others, feelings of superiority and inferiority and so on fall away if one chooses a path of unconditional surrender to God's will, that being the truth of who one is. Many practical examples of how to apply this approach are presented. I found the chapters on relationships and work particularly interesting.<br />As someone who struggled to get to grips with the original &quot;A Course In Miracles&quot; in the 1980s, I thank Marianne Williamson for giving us a more accessible version of the same powerful truths. As with the original text, some people (e.g. me!) may be a bit uncomfortable with some of the use of Christian terminology, but God and God's love are being re-defined here, in a similar fashion to Neale Donald Walsch's extraordinary &quot;Conversations With God&quot; books.

Some 15 years ago, a very similar volume by the Parkers was one of the books from which I learnt the basics of astrology. Their style is accessible, imaginative, and not too heavy.<br />Whether you are interested in basic Sun sign characteristics, basic chart interpretation, prediction techniques, or which sign rules mulberries and bilberries (Sagittarius apparently!), its all here. The book is divided into four sections, which includes detailed tables for drawing up charts. Beginners should not be put off by the long section on the complexities of chart calculation, even though this is useful information. It is of course very easy to get a copy of your natal chart done by computer, and start from there.<br />The often beautiful illustrations and pictures add considerably to the quality information in Parkers Astrology. It certainly makes the process of learning astrology easier on the eye! I recommend this book for the beginner, perhaps together with one of the more &quot;serious&quot; introductions, such as The Classic Guide To Astrology by Ron Davison.	2001-04-24

This makes sense, as &quot;Planetary Cycles&quot; doesn't really give the whole picture, even though there is much top quality astrology, psychology and information as to how the cycles of the planets operate.<br />The book is divided in to 3 sections, &quot;Planetary Cycles And How They Work&quot;, &quot;Crisis Years: Ages And Stages&quot;, and &quot;Counseling A Crisis&quot;. The first and last sections were the most useful to me. In the middle section, although a tremendous amount of hard work has been done to give a balanced picture, I feel there are too many attempts to be specific about the experience of individuals at different ages. The Saturn return, age 29, and the mid-life crisis, age 37-42, are obvious crises and easily identified, but many of the comments about having children, career success or failure, marriage and so on in relation to other ages, often seem rather old-fashioned. I suspect that this shows how much the previously &quot;traditional&quot; patterns have broken down since this book was originally written. It is up to the reader to read between the lines to get a feel of the unfolding patterns as they might relate to them in today's society. Observe them in your own life and other people's.<br />The basic astrology itself is excellent, but would indeed benefit from being absorbed in conjunction with one of the classic works on transits, such as the author's or &quot;Planets In Transit&quot; by Robert Hand or &quot;Future Signs&quot; by Maria Kay Simms.	2001-04-16

Having read or browsed through just about every astrological text available during that time, I can still recommend it as the most concise and comprehensive summary of the basics of chart interpretation available in one book.<br />Davison makes good use of a keyword system which helps in the clarity and accessibility of the information. Many  subtle &quot;esoteric&quot; snippets are also included throughout, insights and perspectives that are neglected by most more modern introductions to astrology. The treatment of the signs of the zodiac, planets, planets in signs, planets in houses and so forth is excellent. There is no waffle here. Philosophical, scientific, practical, historical, spiritual perspectives and others are all covered. The last few chapters bring it all together with some example delineations.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone starting out, perhaps together with some lighter reading such as &quot;Parker's Astrology&quot; or some of the other large and colourful introductions available.	2001-04-14

This is the easiest method of using astrology to look ahead and this makes the book accessible to those relatively inexperienced in astrology.  The opening chapters are a good overview of how transits work. There are many practical suggestions such as the importance of looking at your astrological past to help understand your astrological present and future. The author also gives an intelligent and balanced consideration look at the eternal question of whether our lives are fated or whether we have free will. Throughout the book Maria often refers to astrology as &quot;a tool of choice&quot;, and her attitude to fate is summed up by the following: &quot;The only thing that makes any sense at all is to behave as though what you think and choose and do... matters! You have free will! Believe it!&quot;.<br />Unlike some older books dealing with transits, the more powerful outer planets of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are sensibly featured at the beginning, gradually working down to New Moons and transits of the personal planets. Similarly, transits to the ascendant and midheaven are at the beginning of each planet's section.<br />For the more experienced astrologer, there is little in &quot;Future Signs&quot; that they won't have come across in previous definitive transit books such as &quot;Planets In Transit&quot; by Robert Hand or &quot;Transits: The Time Of Your Life&quot; by Betty Lundsted. But to those not familiar with such or other previous classics, I recommend &quot;Future Signs&quot; as a preferable modern alternative.	2001-04-14

It is clear, positive and uplifting, but it must also be said that some of the content is rather out of date compared to more modern authors such as Anthony Robbins or Dan Millman. Like many books of this nature, I suggest setting aside the 5 or 10 per cent you might not relate to, and concentrating on the excellent remaining 90-95 per cent here.<br />The author tells us that the book is based around a quote from the bible, &quot;as a man thinketh in his heart so is he&quot;. There are many strategies for positive thinking, creative visualization, getting yourself to follow through on intentions and so on. The title is a bit misleading, but early on Ben Sweetland asks us to examine what our personal interpretation of the word &quot;riches&quot; is. It soon becomes clear that money is a means to an end and not the end in itself. There are some good basic affirmations scattered throughout the book e.g. &quot;I am growing in influence and affluence so that I can be of help to humanity&quot;, &quot;I give thanks that I am rich in mind and in my affairs&quot;.<br />If you can cope with some of the old-fashioned language and attitudes, I highly recommend this book.	2001-03-27

One of the main points continually emphasized here is the importance of changing your addictions to preferences. It is okay to have preferred outcomes in life, but once we are no longer attached to results, we are set free to experience life more happily and fully in the here and now. Ken Keyes presents us with numerous ways of achieving this, based around &quot;The Twelve Pathways To The Higher Consciousness Planes Of Unconditional Love And Oneness&quot;.<br />These suggestions are entirely practical, and cover every area of human experience. &quot;You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offense as when you give offense&quot; is a powerful truth, as is &quot;to be upset over what you don't have is to waste what you do have&quot;. &quot;The Instant Consciousness Doubler&quot; of experiencing everything that everyone does or says as though you had done or said it is another winner.

Most astrology books written over the last 20 years, including many classics which I and many others rate very highly, interpret astrology primarily as the map of an individual's psychology. While this approach is not dismissed by Elwell, his perspective is much broader, and simultaneously more simple and more complicated. Astrology as a whole desperately needs the kind of vision and intelligence that are eloquently expressed here.<br />At the beginning of the book Elwell suggests that &quot;we have mistaken the nature of our reality&quot;. This is a theme that runs throughout Cosmic Loom. An astrology chart is not only an accurate map of the psychology of an individual human being, it is much, much more. Rather, it is more a set of instructions, revealing what the cosmos is up to at a precise moment in time. We are treated to fascinating chart interpretations of the birth of the United States, the publication of Darwin's &quot;Origin Of Species&quot;, and all manner of events from the most contemporary and mundane, to important moments in history.<br />Elwell expands the cosmic science and language of astrology in its own terms. His imaginative but also absolutely literal interpretation of  the chart opens up a whole new reality.  Internal and external events in our lives are linked as Elwell plugs directly into a universe where everything is connected to everything else, where the observer is inseparable from what he or she is observing, where everything has a part to play in the great plan of life.<br />I feel that even many experienced astrologers may be taken by surprise with this book and that it may be ahead of its time. Expect the unexpected!	2001-03-13

Millman's style is gentle and holistic, and reads a bit like a modern update of the excellent &quot;You'll See It When You Believe It&quot; by Wayne Dyer. This is very much a compliment!<br />Practical suggestions for physical, financial, mental, emotional and spiritual personal development are featured throughout. These are divided into twelve &quot;gateways&quot;, beginning with recognizing your self-worth and ending with living your daily life as a spiritual practice in itself. The chapter on managing your money I found very useful when developing my own business as an astrologer. His treatment of sexuality, an area not always covered so openly in books of this kind, was another highlight. &quot;Illuminating Your Shadow&quot; is a balanced consideration of the dark side of anyone attempting to live a more spiritual life. Compassion for ourselves and others is continually emphasized in this section, as elsewhere.<br />Millman has used a wide range of quotes to support his ideas, contributions coming from Aldous Huxley, Miss Piggy and St. Augustine to name a few. My favourite is from Christopher Morley:- &quot;No man is lonely while eating spaghetti; it requires so much attention&quot;.	2001-03-11

To anyone seriously considering practicing astrology as a profession, even if only part-time, this book is essential reading. It is another example of the exceptional and inspired writing of Stephen Arroyo, who covers a very broad range of often neglected issues here. Many of them will be familiar to anyone who has practiced, or attempted to practice, astrology for a number of years, but for those starting out, the observations, insights and suggestions will be tremendously supportive.<br />Arroyo uses many excellent quotes from a vast range of sources to discuss astrology and its position in the modern world. Is it a science, a language, or a healing tool? What can it show you? Can it inspire you? Can it help you understand what other human beings and you yourself are going through in this life? What are the skills and qualifications necessary to be a good astrologer? How much should you charge? What kind of one to one connection can we make with other people? Do we have the necessary listening and communicating skills?<br />Since most of this book was written, I would suggest that in some ways things have got better for anyone attempting to practice intelligent and genuinely consciousness-raising astrology. Most obviously, an increasing percentage of Western society are now aware that real astrology is not about newspaper horoscopes. On the other hand, some changes in society are mixed blessings. As discussed in chapter 7, widespread use of computers by astrologers has cut out lots of tedious calculations, but the valuable period spent pondering the birth chart may be lost, thus possibly lowering the quality of interpretation. Similarly, although not anti-technology, Arroyo observes &quot;there is a general degradation of standards in virtually every field that is widely promoted on the internet&quot;.<br />Overall, an absolute must if you are considering professional involvement.	2001-03-08

With the main emphasis on the planets, Donna Cunningham provides an excellent overall introduction to chart interpretation and transits. It is obvious that this book is based on a great deal of practical experience working with astrology, and her extensive background in social work and mental health is a strong positive influence.<br />The approach to astrology here is all about empowering the individual. The planets mirror back to us the truth of our lives, and armed with this self-knowledge we can begin to take more responsibility for ourselves. The chart can help by showing more constructive uses of our basic traits. Cunningham is keen to avoid any cop-out as in blaming our chart or the planets for bad things in our lives. &quot;Wrong thinking and wrong actions are at the root of most of our troubles&quot; sums up her approach.<br />One unusual feature are comments on the meaning of the symbols for some of the planets and signs e.g. the glyphs for Jupiter and Saturn being upside down versions of each other. There are many other interesting bits and pieces. The final chapter is a very touching and moving account of an evening with astrological students who are recovering alcoholics, and their trip to an astronomical observatory.	2001-03-07

Having read all of the extraordinary international best-selling Conversations With God books several times over, Friendship With God remains my favourite. The majority of the content is a reiteration of the first three books of the series, but as the title suggests, the tone here is more informal. This is, literally, how to have a friendship with God.<br /><br />Most of the book is in dialogue form. However, Neale Donald Walsch shares considerably more of his background and life history than in other books in the series. I found this added to my already profound appreciation of all the CWG books. Not surprisingly, Mr. Walsch has had a very, very wide range of life experiences, including working with the dying with Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, involvements with radio, television, advertising and a period of time spent virtually living on the streets.<br /><br />The last few chapters are particularly well written and build up to an enlightening climax that is well worth repeated reading. In Friendship With God, Walsch  has continued his mission to \\"give people back to themselves\\" superbly. The New Gospel of  \\"WE  ARE  ALL  ONE.  OURS  IS  NOT  A  BETTER  WAY,  OURS  IS  MERELY  ANOTHER  WAY\\" is yet another example of the deceptively simple, powerful, revolutionary truths presented in all the Conversations With God books.	2001-03-06

This is more factual and less occult than Cosmic Trigger I, and more easily understood than Cosmic Trigger III. For me, Wilson gets the balance just right in this one.<br /><br />Cosmic Trigger II is semi-autobiographical, presented mainly in short sections of one or two pages which can mostly be read separately from each other. It is a good book for opening up at random now and again, and pondering on one of these short chapters. You might get some sobering observations on the human condition, or a bit of enlightenment and a really good laugh! There are also however, many interconnecting themes running throughout the book. Along the way, just about every belief system in  human experience is called into question. A whole range of political, religious, scientific, and philosophical points of view are embraced and/or seriously challenged, not to mention the mechanical thought patterns of the reader as well. By continually shifting his and your perception, Wilson gets you to WAKE UP!<br /><br />A brief selection from the table of contents might give newcomers at least some idea of the range of this book: A Sociological Horoscope, Attack of the Killer Spider, Cosmic Economics, The Square Root of Minus One and Other Mysteries.  The author suggests that the important lesson of Cosmic Trigger II can be summed up as follows: \\"1. Never believe totally in anybody else's Belief System. 2. Never believe totally in your own Belief System.\\" Excellent. Read this book and free your mind!	2001-03-06

In some ways this attempt to integrate so much knowledge works well, but as my own interest is primarily astrology, I found some of the other content a distraction from her often original and insightful treatment of the major cycles of Saturn, Uranus and Chiron.<br /><br />For example, although I have practised various forms of meditation and am familiar with the chakras and kundalini, I don't know if the correspondences to the more extreme physical, psychological and spiritual crises described at the Uranus opposition \\"mid-life crisis\\" are as Clow suggests. Yes there are unexpected shocks, energy shifts, and major changes of life direction at around age 40 when the transit kicks in, but whether this relates to the unblocking of chakras and the rising of kundalini is another matter, for me at least. Perhaps she is ahead of me here.<br /><br />However, this book is packed with so many different perspectives, I would be surprised if many people could wholeheartedly embrace all of them! Shamanism, the end of the Mayan Great Calendar, scientific insights on energy fields, mythology, all feature. It is powerful stuff. There is some quality astrology and at times an unusual blend of \\"far out\\" cosmic ideas with a very firm grip on reality in the Western world. There are some interesting sociological observations on the pros and cons of different types of spirituality and a  large number of case histories to demonstrate the key life stages described. I keep coming back to sections of the book that I personally find useful, and suspect that many others would do the same.	2001-03-05

I have continued to read and re-read this over the last few years. In the best possible sense, it is a Saturnian treatment of the transits of Saturn. There is also a great deal of other high quality non-Saturn astrology here.<br />In addition to her obvious extensive experience as a practising astrologer, Erin Sullivan draws extensively on depth psychology and classical mythology to portray Saturn's developmental influence on our lives. The fourth section of the book, \\"The Personal Heroic Journey\\" stands out for me. Here the journey of Saturn around the birth chart is illuminated profoundly and accessibly. Sullivan begins the cycle at the midheaven and tenth house stage, \\"The Call To Adventure\\" as she terms it, in contrast to the more conventional viewpoint that places the ascendant and first house at the beginning of the cycle. From there on she comments on Saturn's movement round the chart and the various inner and outer lessons it has to teach us.<br />Countless practical examples are referred to throughout, with two contrasting case histories at the end showing how different but essentially similar each individual's \\"heroic quest for meaning\\" can be. As befits a book on Saturn it does all get a bit heavy going at times but is well worth the effort!	2001-03-04
US	49891672	R352X6TAU2R02B	091636058X	387083870	Exploring Jupiter: Astrological Key to Progress, Prosperity & Potential	Books	5	68	68	N	N	Yet another contemporary classic by Stephen Arroyo	This book is the very essence of Jupiter. From its apt title, to its generous use of many famous chart examples, to Arroyo's trademark insight and wisdom on every page, \\"Exploring Jupiter\\" is positively a  winner! The presentation of the astrology is clear, practical and  intelligent, making it a must for both newer students and more experienced  practising astrologers.<br /><br />While outlining a framework for understanding  Jupiter in chapter one, the author comments: \\"...I cannot help but  feel that Jupiter's bigness and broad vision is inextricably linked to the  perennial human search for a larger truth and for an experience of oneness  with the universe\\". The range of natal charts throughout the book  reflects this, each one accompanied by a brief biographical account and  astrological notes. Albert Einstein, Woody Allen, Eleanor Roosevelt,  Michael Jordan, Robert Redford, William Blake are just a few of the wide  range of Jupiterian characters covered.<br /><br />Unlike the majority of modern  astrologers, Arroyo refers to Jupiter's ancient rulership of Pisces as  being significant, and the book is written with this in mind. Otherwise  much of the book is built on the usual \\"cookbook\\" approach:  Jupiter through the signs, Jupiter through the houses (arranged by  element), Jupiter aspects in the birth chart and so on. As always with  Stephen Arroyo, it is the clarity and profound depth of these guidelines  for interpretation that is so striking. The chapter on transits involving  Jupiter is particularly good, building on ideas he has expressed in earlier  writings.	2000-03-21
US	49891672	R3JI45ZLP6X06L	0916360490	104797295	Chart Interpretation Handbook: Guidelines for Understanding the Essentials of the Birth Chart	Books	5	89	92	N	N	The most accessible and accurate book of its kind	Those familiar with Stephen Arroyo will not be surprised by the exceptional quality of this handbook which builds on his previous best-selling astrology books. In fact some of the content is directly lifted from previous work such as \\"Astrology,Karma and  Transformation\\", but the book is no less value for money as a result.  Step by step, Arroyo uses clear, modern language to reveal the essential  meanings of any birth chart. Wisdom and clear intelligent insights spring  from every page and even an experienced astrologer can benefit from  Arroyo's imaginative and precise use of language.<br /><br />Unlike some of  Arroyo's early work, the Chart Interpretation Handbook is expertly laid  out, due no doubt to the editing skills of Jerilynn Marshall who Arroyo  enthusiastically acknowledges. Its all here: the four elements and the  twelve signs, key concepts for the planets, the planets in the signs, the  ascendant and midheaven, the houses and planetary aspects. And, true to  Arroyo's sense of humour (always bubbling away beneath the profound depth  of his writing), there's even a couple of cartoons!<br /><br />I had been a  practising astrologer for several years when this came out, and after one  read through, the Chart Interpretation Handbook became my primary reference  for birth chart work. It still is today! Highly recommended.	2000-03-14

Just about every serious astrologer I've ever met has got a copy of this on his or her shelf!<br /><br />For most of the book, Robert Hand explores the meaning of every  possible combination of planetary transits, including those to the  ascendant and midheaven (astrologers using Chiron however, will have to  look elsewhere). The introductory chapters about the interpretation and  timing of transits are well worth a read, and these are followed by a case  study of Nixon and the Watergate scandals in the early 1970s. Then its on  to a chapter for each planet and the transits it makes to all the  others.<br /><br />Hand's interpretations are full of psychological insights, but  the nature of specific events that may occur are also covered. For the  first few years I had this book I tended to focus on the more obvious  long-term transits of the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune,  Pluto) but eventually I became just as intrigued by the uncanny accuracy of  the \\"insignificant\\" daily or even hourly transits of the Sun, the  Moon and Mercury. The smallest and the largest life cycles have their part  to play.<br /><br />Buy this book and prove or disprove predictive astrology for  yourself!	2000-03-14

Dr. de Bono distinguishes between two types of revolution, the  negative revolutions of the past and the positive revolution, which some  people might feel has continued to develop since this book was published in  1991.<br /><br />De Bono suggests that those who wish to create a more positive  future could do well to turn away from traditional \\"I am right - you  are wrong\\" thinking. In negative revolutions of the past (e.g. the  Marxist fight against capitalism) there is an enemy to be hated, this  hatred giving cohesion and energy to the revolutionaries. With a positive  revolution however, there is construction instead of attack, design instead  of criticism, change through awareness instead of change through violence.  A flexible sense of humour is proposed instead of an inflexible  ideology!<br /><br />Five basic principles are outlined: effectiveness,  constructive, respect, self-improvement, contribution. The proposed  positive revolution is certainly not a passive one. Self-improvement  suggestions include learning new skills (anything from learning a new  language to starting up a new business) and becoming better at anything you  are doing. The section on respect draws on the Chinese wisdom of Confucius,  who claimed that if everyone behaved properly towards other people,  civilization would work.<br /><br />Although some of the slogans and symbols towards  the end are a bit gimmicky for my taste, I continue to dip into this  deceptively simple book for positive inspiration, many years after I bought  it.	2000-03-14

On reading \\"You'll See It When You Believe It\\", it very quickly becomes clear that Wayne Dyer is actually living the ideas he is writing about. There are numerous suggestions as to how to  transform your life for the better, ranging from going beyond your  \\"comfort zone\\" on a regular basis, to meditation and other  self-awareness strategies. He also recommends being easy on yourself when  you slip back into bad habits! There is a gentle compassion throughout  Wayne Dyer's writing.<br /><br />The chapter on \\"Oneness\\" uses quotes from  Albert Einstein and Paramahansa Yogananda to help show the fundamental  inter-connectedness of all things. This theme is continued later in the  book when Dyer explores synchronicity. Beginning with obvious connections  that are easy to believe in, such as a car moving when petrol has been put  in it, Dyer ends up in the bizarre and mystical world of subatomic physics.  Here, particles make decisions in relation to other particles that may be  in a different galaxy but are still somehow intimately connected. Applying  this model to human life on earth, we may be a lot more responsible for our  collective reality than we had hitherto assumed.<br /><br />Wayne Dyer asks us to  wake up, forgive ourselves and each other, and transform our lives through  using our thoughts constructively. Excellent stuff!	2000-03-14

The depth of Stephen Arroyo's writing here is extraordinary, with perhaps the only criticism being that so much is packed in to one single book. But this is hardly a complaint!<br />The outer planets are covered extensively with many examples of aspects and transits to the birth charts of people with relatively \\"ordinary\\" lives. This makes a refreshing change from much astrological literature that deals only with famous people, or people with severe problems of one kind or another. The chapter on Saturn is excellent, particularly the journey of Saturn through the twelve houses. Show any 29-year old (with a bit of self-awareness!) the section featuring the Saturn return, and watch their reaction as they read!<br />This book is not only full of essential contemporary astrology; Arroyo also draws on his considerable experience of other tools for spiritual and psychological growth. He has a background in marriage and family counselling (chapter on \\"Karma and relationships\\"), and his many references to various spiritual teachers, eastern religions, western psychology and the Edgar Cayce psychic readings add to the spiritual power of Arroyo's writing. A modern classic.	2000-03-14
