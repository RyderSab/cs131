I did miss her mother and father and her fiance, Jack (no relation) Reilly.  It's a fun and fast read, especially enjoyable on a long car or plane trip. <br />The ending is a good one for all concerned, villains excluded. It's exactly what one wants and expects from Carol Higgins Clark. <br /> <br />That said, I must remark that, as a faithful viewer of the CSI and Law & Order franchises, I was appalled by the sloppiness of the police work.  The crime should have been solved before Regan landed in Hawaii.  A valuable piece of evidence, the lei, was returned to the museum instead of taken by the police to be processed.  The victim's apartment was NOT sealed and probably hadn't even been searched.  Regan found a valuable clue in plain sight and walked out with it with no trouble.  Dorinda's cousin was free to dispose of the contents as he chose.  This is so bad it's pathetic.  Gil Grissom would be holding his head in sheer horror, and Detectives Fontana & Green would be in shock.  Because of this gaping hole in the plot, I am subtracting a star.	2005-03-21

Last year every picture was in color and every dancer was in full costume.  This year, half or more of the pictures are in black & white and many are rehearsal shots.  These are not the pictures I bought the calendar to display.  I hope that next year they go back to the previous format and eschew black & white and rehearsal pictures.  Actual performance pictures would be wonderful.	2005-01-03

It is, however, quite forgettable once you've done reading.  Alvirah Meehan, the former cleaning lady whose life was changed when she won the lottery, and her husband Willy are heading to Stowe, Vermont, for a long weekend with their friends Nora Reagan Reilly, the detective novelist, her funeral director husband, their detective daughter Reagan Reilly, and her fiancee Jack (no relation) Reilly.  Alvirah invites her friend Opal, a lottery winner who gave her money to a con man and lost it all.  Besides skiing, they are looking forward to watching the cutting down of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree.  Packy, the con man who has been in jail for the last twelve years, and his two henchmen Benny and JoJo are also heading there to retrieve a flask of diamonds, his ill-gotten gains from his scam, from the giant blue spruce where he hid it before he was apprehended and sent to prison.  Naturally their paths cross and, of course, Alvirah, Reagan, and their families save the day. <br /> <br />This is a short book, which isn't bad for an evening if there are no good programs on television or a brief car trip.  I was not happy that we didn't see much of the Meehans or the Reillys. <br />Opal is a sympathetic character, as is Milo, the \\"poet\\" who helped Packy and his gang but didn't know he was doing anything illegal.  Packy is rather nasty, so it's good to see him get his comeuppance.  And the tree's owners are too obsessive about the tree and its fate.  That just doesn't ring true. <br /> <br />I'm not sorry I bought the book, and the Amazon price was right, but it's nothing that will stick with me over the long run.	2004-11-18

An Unofficial, Independent Guide with Critiques	Books	4	9	9	N	Y	Good Content But Mediocre Presentation	This should have been the definitive guide to Crusade.  From the point of view of content, it certainly was.  The plot summaries and critiques were well-written and comprehensive.  There was little left out that should have been there.  However, the book itself left much to be desired, beginning with pictures.  Most guide books to television series, as The Watcher's Guides of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel: Casefiles contain numerous pictures, usually in color.  There were NO pictures in this book; at least there should have been pictures of the cast and the basic sets.  The printing itself was too dark; spaces between paragraphs were too small, making the book less easy to read.  I feel that the publisher did not do justice to what could have been an outstanding book.  I actually give the book 5 stars for content and 1 star for publication.	2004-11-03

Most of the stories take place in 20th century  North America, 2 in New York, 1 in Chicago just before the onset of Prohibition, 1 in rural Pennsylvania, 1 in a small town in Nebraska, and 1 in Nova Scotia.  The other two are set in 1876 Ireland and 1981 Seville, during the Spanish Inquisition, which I found to be the most interesting of the lot.  The Grand Inquisitor Tomas de Torquemada makes an appearance in this one. <br /> <br />The stories have an interesting variety, considering that the subject of all of them is the same.  One girl is a pacifist, not wanting to be the Slayer any more.  Another is a carnival performer.  Two are Jewish and, for that reason, are probably less than beloved of the Watcher's Council.   <br /> <br />I found the story Survivors to be quite sad, as Dot's Watcher, who left to fight in World War I, has descended into melancholia and perhaps madness.  Dot virtually becomes his caretaker as he lapses into delusion.  Two Teenage Girls at the Mall, told by a 16 year old newly made female vampire, is also very sad, making the reader wish that somehow there could be a positive resolution for both the Slayer and Julie, the vampire. <br /> <br />The first story, It's All About the Mission, deals with Nikki Wood, who is pregnant with her son Robin, who will become the principal of Sunnydale High School one day.  We all know that she will eventually be killed by Spike, so the focus of the story is how she survives rather than if she will survive. <br /> <br />In the story Undeadsville, the Slayer Zoe Kuryakin refers to her cousin Illya, who is studying in Russia.  Could he become one of the Men from U.N.C.L.E., portrayed by David McCallum?  It wouldn't surprise me if it was meant to be a reference to the popular television show of the 60's! <br /> <br />In an earlier volume in this series, reference was made to \\"the doxy Darla.\\"  She is mentioned again as a friend of hers says, <br />\\"Has ever a Slayer met her end in such a delightfully slapstick manner?  I shall have to tell Darla about this when next we meet.  She's bound to find the tale uproarious.\\"  That was quite clever.  It's rather surprising that we see so little of the vampires from the Order of Aurelius--Darla, Angelus, Drusilla, and William the Bloody--in these stories.  Quentin Travers does make an appearance, and he was every bit as unpleasant then as he is in the present time. <br /> <br />These are interesting stories, fun and quick to read.  I recommend them.	2004-10-31

All but two of the characters we have come to know & love are there: Chakotay, new Captain of the Voyager, with Harry Kim as his head of security;  Admiral Janeway & Tuvok teaching at Star Fleet Academy, where Seven of Nine and the Doctor are members of a Think Tank and the Doctor continues his fight for Holographic Rights. Tom, B'Elanna, and their daughter are on the Klingon world Boreth searching for clues about why some think their daughter is a Messiah.  Neelix is still in the Delta Quadrant; Kes' whereabouts are unknown.   <br /> <br />On his first Starfleet mission as a Captain, Chakotay is ferrying some colonists back to their home planet, evacuated during the Cardassian War.  His sister, Sekaya, is along as a spiritual advisor to the colonists, helping to make their reintegration into the world easier.  Back on earth, Harry Kim's beloved Libby is combining her career as a musician with her other calling as a spy for the Federation, rooting out moles.  And several new characters are included, most notably Dr. Jarem Kaz, a joined Trill whose last host was active in the Maquis, the ship's physician, and Astall, the counselor from a race called the Huanni, who are even more empathetic than Betazoids.  Commander Andrew \\"Priggy\\" Ellis, a by the book officer, is his second in command. <br /> <br />The trip is uneventful until they near the planet, when things go horribly wrong. . . <br /> <br />It's good to see most of the old faces in a new Voyager adventure. I enjoyed this and am looking forward to the sequel. <br /> <br />One criticism: the book cover read Spirit Walk Book One.  It didn't specify one of two, one of three, one of six thousand.  It would have been helpful to know how many were in this series.	2004-10-26

There were publication delays which resulted in my finally receiving the book yesterday!  It was well worth waiting for.  Unlike Rachael's other books, this one is in full color with lots of interesting pictures and the names and addresses of all restaurants she visited for 55 shows.  There are some recipes as well.  The restaurants are grouped geographically rather than chronologically, in the order in which she visited them.  Evidently she read the message boards, because she explains why she tips 15%.  She does it to bring the show in on budget.  When she's not eating for the show, she tips 20% or more.  She was a little dismayed when numerous people said that La Madeleine, where she breakfasted in Dallas, was a chain.  She does not avoid quality chains, as this is, but rather does not go to fast food places. <br /> <br />All in all this is an excellent book and would be very useful for anyone who plans to visit a city where Rachael has spent her 24 hours.  I know I'll look at it before I travel.	2004-10-22

She reminded me very much of Lt. Anita Van Buren (S. Epatha Merkerson on Law & Order), and, in fact, I visualized her that way.  The denouement was a surprise and yet it was not unfair in the least.  The Santa Fe story turned me off a little because of Michael Weems' art.  I cannot believe the choice of subjects.  I wasn't as fond of the detectives in this story either.  However, as I said, the books are fast reading and good for passing time when you're stuck waiting.	2004-10-08

The plot was intriguing, teaching me a great deal about book publishing.  The characters were well-drawn and true to the television series.  If I had one caveat, it would be that there's a slight imbalance in the elements of the plot--instead of being 50-50 between the detectives and the district attorneys, it's maybe 60-40.  I found myself wondering when we'd see Jack &amp; Serena.  As we know so little about Serena's private life, the last chapter provided some refreshing insight.  I had been looking forward to this book for a long time, as it had appeared on Amazon with no publishing date.  Now I hope another one will be forthcoming soon.	2004-07-12

There were too many possible candidates for The Owl, and none of them were very well drawn.  I also found his motivation to be implausible for the havoc he wreaked and the number of lives he claimed.  I must admit to liking some of the peripheral characters, particularly Sam, but I didn't really care for Laura or even Jean all that much.  I realize the event in Jean's past was traumatic, but in 20 years she should have been able to come to grips with it better.  Perhaps the next book will have characters I can relate to better.  I hope so.	2004-04-14

In this case the stories are based on the novels of Charles Dickens.  Two of the stories are based on A Christmas Carol, including my favorite, A Stake of Holly, in which a dying Scrooge, 19 years after the events of the novel, charges Tim Cratchitt to discover the earthly identities of the three Ghosts.  As he investigates, he uncovers a diabolical murder.  Two are based on A Tale of Two Cities.  In Death in Dover the crime is solved by a well-known character from another novel.  Sidney Carton is the detective in Anne Perry's story A Tale of One City, in which Marat &amp; Robespierre play roles.  There are two Great Expectations Tales, two from the Pickwick Papers, one modern-day story revolving around an Oliver Twist manuscript, and two in which Dickens himself is the detective, once with his friend and fellow author Wilkie Collins and the other with his son-in-law (and Wilkie's brother) Charles Collins.  You don't have to know Dickens to enjoy these stories, which are to be read, re-read, and savored.	2004-03-31

She is a young wife and mother, 30 years of age, attending a weekend house party at the home of her friend Omegus Jones.  There Isobel Alvie, a young widow who is vying for the attention of an eligible bachelor, makes a cruel and cutting remark about Gwendolen, another young widow who would appear to be about to become engaged to him.  The next morning Gwendolen is dead, an obvious suicide.  Omegus proposes a medieval solution that could allow Isobel, who the guests find responsible for Gwendolen's death, to redeem herself.  It will be a long and bitter journey in the cold of early winter to deliver Gwendolen's last letter to her mother, who lives in the north of Scotland.  Vespasia, in friendship, offers to accompany Isobel.  The journey is longer and much more difficult than anticipated, but the women persevere and meet another remarkable woman, Gwendolen's mother.<br />The morals and mores of mid-nineteenth century England may seem strange and unusually strict to us, but Isobel and Vespasia must learn to live within those rules.  As they travel, they share their thoughts and develop a true friendship.  It is a journey of discovery for both of them, as they look deep inside themselves.  I do agree with another reviewer that Vespasia dwells too much on her affair with Marco in Rome, but I assume that it is still a very recent occurrence, so that is understandable.<br />What I do not understand, however, is Vespasia's willingness to leave her children, well cared for though they are, for long periods of time, first to go to Rome and again to travel to Scotland.  Again, I suppose it is customary for the gentry and nobility of that era to do so.  Nevertheless, it surprised and disappointed me.<br />However, this is an excellent book which I highly recommend to all who love Aunt Vespasia and wish a glimpse of the young woman who became a great lady.	2003-11-29

First of all, she is stuck in a dead-end life until she meets Jack.  Her boyfriend says he loves her but doesn't seem to want to commit; her day job is nothing to brag about; and her acting career is totally stalled.  Then she meets Jack, who opens doors for her, and feels guilty about the help she is getting.  Although her more successful rival for television roles and Jack's romantic rival David are taken out of the picture, neither of them are permanently injured. Then she begins to believe that he's the devil.  I can't understand her or admire her at all.  Jack has done nothing except show no remorse for other people's tragedies, and yet she's willing to run away from love, happiness, and success.  Unbelievable!  The ending isn't bad, but it seems to be something of a copout.  I did enjoy it, but it's forgettable.	2003-09-14

I was so wrong.  This book has no redeeming features whatever.  It would be a teen book (and not fodder for the [local store]) if not for the explicit sex.  It gives no clear picture of the university, supposedly a California Ivy.  Eve, the heroine, is poorly drawn and not terribly sympathetic.  She has no ambition other than to become head cheerleader and marry well.  Kendra, her roommate, is a far more interesting character.  There is no motivation for the Fata Morgana's choice of Eve for doom.  Even the cheerleading tryouts (for a major university!) are a farce, as is the size of the squad.  Do not waste your money on this book.	2003-07-20

In the hands of someone less skilled, it would deserve perhaps one star.  In the first place, I am aghast at the fact that Brad Evans, an attorney with two young children, would have no life insurance to protect his family!  A 26-year-old single female attorney, less than a year out of law school, told me she already has a quarter of a million dollars in life insurance.  Unbelievable!  (That is the biggest suspension of disbelief in the book!)<br />Secondly, you can see everything coming, and I do mean everything.  I realize The Glow was not a particularly best-selling book, but did no one else sense the \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" connection?  And The Glow was recently on television.  I read this only because I was on a long car trip with my in-laws and found this preferable!  <br />If you are at all familiar with some classic horror books or movies, don't bother to read this book.  Caroline is a twit!  Ryan is a holy terror (even if he's right).  The situation the family finds itself in is laughable.  Do not bother with this book!	2003-05-05

A new Pitt & Charlotte book is always a cause for celebration, and this one is no exception.  Pitt finds himself faced with a murder case that could have major national and international repercussions, while Charlotte and her maid, the intrepid Gracie, look into the disappearance of Gracie's friend's brother, a valet.  Gracie is a wonderful character, and her relationship with Inspector Tellman takes a step forward.  Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould plays a major role in both investigations and, as always, is a truly memorable character.  While Pitt's investigation takes him to the exotic Alexandria, Egypt, Charlotte's carries her to one of London's worst slums.  Of course both cases will dovetail into a most satisfying solution.  I must confess that I had suspected something slightly different from the actual solution, but Anne Perry's was far superior to mine!  I wish Emily Radley, Charlotte's sister, could have played a bigger role, but maybe next time!	2003-02-08

A truly excellent story was Lady Shobu, set in 10th century Japan; a lot of research went into this very well-written and exciting tale.  Another is a hard-boiled detective story of a married slayer and gangster Frank Nitti entitled Stakeout on Rush Street; I loved it.  I did not like Blood and Brine, partiallly because I'm not particularly fond of the time period, but primarily because I do not like dialect stories; however, I did like seeing the mention of the \\"doxy, Darla.\\"  Two stories, to remain nameless here, deal with slayers who must pose as men because of the particular conditions of the times.  Another features a stubborn slayer who just wants a normal life and an equally stubborn Watcher's Council, who denies it to her, with truly disastrous results; this story left a very bad taste in my mouth.  I found the homage to A Christmas Carol to be a little [poor], and The War Between the States badly titled and confusing, but, in the end, quite good.  But there are two good Buffy stories as well.  All in all, it's a good addition to the basic Buffy library.  Perhaps a third volume might deal with the two slayers Spike has killed in the past or with a slayer who has encountered Darla, Angelus, and/or Drusilla, and may or may not have lived to tell the tale.  Writers, just a humble suggestion!	2003-02-03

Kudos, applause, and a standing ovation for Anne Perry and this fantastic book of short stories.  There are so many truly unique and amazing stories that it's hard to choose which is best.  Some involve actual Shakespearean plots, including two of the funniest: Too Many Cooks, which is a hilarious take on Macbeth from the point of view of the three Weird Sisters, and The Fall of the House of Oldenbourg, which will assure that you never think of Hamlet the same way again.  Those Are Pearls That Were His Eyes combines characters from The Tempest with Portia & her husband Bassanio of The Merchant of Venice as the most brilliant and beautiful Doctor of Laws solves a murder with Caliban as the accused.  The beautiful Viola (disguised as Caesario disguised as Viola--shades of Victor/Victoria and Shakespeare in Love!) solves the murder of Olivia's brother in A Dish of Poison.  Even two of the lesser known plays, Cymbeline and Measure for Measure feature in the stories.  Some, like Anne Perry's excellent Ere I Killed Thee, deal with the players who perform these works.  The bard himself appears in several of the stories, including Exit, Followed. . .and All the World's a Stage, and his death is investigated in The Serpent's Tooth.  And Richard's Children can only be described as chilling.  I wish that there had been stories based on Romeo and Juliet, The Taming of the Shrew, and Midsummer's Night's Dream, but perhaps there will be a volume 2.  One can only hope.  This is a fantastic book for mystery lovers and for Shakespeare lovers, but heaven for those who, like myself, love them both.  Buy it, read it, and recommend it to your friends!	2003-01-30

In the first place, the book is highly slanted to some characters while totally ignoring others.  Amber Benson (Tara McClay) never appeared in the opening credits of Buffy, yet she rates 8 pages in the Cast chapter plus a large color picture and several large black &amp; white ones; Marc Blucas (Riley Finn), who did appear in the opening credits for two seasons, gets none.  Other recurring characters get little or no credit, particularly Lorne (Andy Hallett), Lilah (Stephanie Romanoff), Joyce Summers (Kristine Sutherland), Darla (Julie Benz), Drusilla (Juliet Landau), and my personal favorite, Lindsey McDonald (Christian Kane).  Christian rates one small picture, and the character's name is misspelled in the caption.  In addition there is a huge chapter about posting board parties and another about a fan, Little Willow.  This space could, and should, have been used for the overlooked characters.  The importance of Wolfram &amp; Hart, and particularly Lindsey, is largely overlooked in the Angel summaries.  In fact, Angel is given rather short shrift in the episode reviews as opposed to the Buffy reviews.  Its only saving grace is that it did include season 6 of Buffy and season 3 of Angel.  This could, and should, have been a much better book with a better focus on what was really important.  I am truly disappointed.	2002-11-11

However, I hadn't expected to enjoy it as much as I did.  Cruver writes with charm and wit.  His descriptions of the goings-on at Enron are very good; his tales of the duck-hunting trip (which included an explanation of what had gone wrong that even I could understand) and of his visits to the psychiatrist were wonderfully funny.  I feel as if I know him and that, if I did, I would like him.  I can definitely picture Brian Dennehey as the mysterious &quot;Mr. Blue&quot; and Mike Farrell as Kenneth Lay.  My only criticism is that there was little about his wife and their relationship.  Didn't they talk about the situation at all?  Maybe that will be emphasized a little more in the movie, as Shannon Elizabeth will be playing Courtney Cruver.  But I consider the book to be well worth the money.	2002-09-03

He writes with flair and with great humor.  It was a book I found hard to put down, and I look forward to more.  Unfortunately his holonovels won't be out for several hundred years, so we'll have to make do with the printed page.  Kudos to Picardo and his friend and illustrator Jeff Yagher.

Making things worse, she has not heard from her mother, the indomitable Lwaxana, or her two-year-old brother Barin, who are trapped on the planet, since the invasion.  The mysterious Commander Elias Vaughn, who has appeared in several other TNG & DSN books, has provided her with this chance to save the Betazed and possibly the Federation, as the withdrawal of Dominion/Cardassian control from Betazed would remove them from a position of proximity to other Federation worlds.  Deanna, along with Vaughn, Data, and Dr. Crusher, form a commando troop to carry out the mission on Betazed, while Riker, Geordi, and Miles O'Brien, have a mission of their own on the Cardassian space station orbiting Betazed.  Worf joins O'Brien in a welcome return to TNG from DSN.  This is an exciting book and, as a Deanna Troi fan from day 1, a book I highly recommend.  Even someone who does not enjoy the \\"science\\" in \\"science fiction\\" can follow this plot easily.  Buy it; you'll like it.	2002-04-01

It was the kind of book that, although you don't want to, you can put down easily because of the short chapters.  There's always a good place to stop and pick up again.<br />As for the plot, well, there was something that happened to one of the women that I did not care for at all.  I felt that was a cheap trick.  I also felt that the solution left something to be desired, but, as I do not want to spoil the book for anyone, I won't go on.<br />I did get this book ..., so I feel that I got a choice burger for less than a steak price.

However, I was somewhat appalled at Juliet for two reasons.  One, a pregnant woman does not have to be a slob, and she definitely was.  Two, her daughter, although bright and creative, is a brat.  I know this because she reminds me a great deal of my 6 1/2 year old granddaughter.  If you can't control a child when she's two, you can't control her at six or at sixteen.  Some discipline is sadly overdue here, but it's not too late at this point.  And dear Peter is an enabler. The whole family needs to get its act together quickly while Isaac (I can't possibly imagine allowing a 2 year old to choose her sibling's name--what were they thinking?) is young enough to be controllable.  However, I enjoyed the book and I do intend to purchase her new novel.	2001-08-21

I was very disappointed that this is the first of two or more and that the next book won't be out till spring.  Nothing on the jacket led one to believe that this wasn't the complete story.<br />Kirk, Spock, McCoy, etc, play very small roles in this story.  I assume they will do more in the following.<br />Finally, as a die-hard romantic, there was one more disappointment for me, but I refuse to spoil anything by saying more.	2001-07-31

However, the intrepid Gracie and her reluctant swain Sergeant Tellman more than take up the slack.  There is an intrepid Clark Kent type reporter, a Supreme Court justice with his own agenda, and, of course, a brief visit by Emily, who functions as a shoulder to cry on and a babysitter, which is something of a loss to those who remember her courage and resourcefulness in other books. Aunt Vespasia is a major figure, and we learn some secrets of her past. About halfway through the book, it began to remind me of a movie I had seen about 20 or so years ago called Murder by Decree, starring Christopher Plummer as Sherlock Holmes, James Mason as Doctor Watson, Susan Clark as a London prostitute, and Genevieve Bujold as an unfortunate young woman.  If it's available to you, watch it in conjunction with this book.  You'll see what I mean. It was good to see the Gracie/Tellman story unfold a little more. Anne Perry is outstanding at developing romances.  Long may she write!	2001-02-06

Geordi is  part of a romantic triangle with his dream woman Leah Brahms &amp; a very  interesting geologist.  Riker and Deanna are still a couple; she beams down  to a soon-to-be-destroyed planet to rescue him. Worf does not appear, as he  is probably on Deep Space Nine.  However, there is just too much  &quot;science&quot; and not as much plot as I would like, as there was in  one of my least favorite Next Gen books, Dyson Sphere, which is why I have  given this book four stars instead of five.	2000-08-29

On the whole, I enjoyed the six books that make up The Captain's Table.   However, the Janeway story, while quite interesting, was a disappointment  because the crew of Voyager hardly appeared at all.  I would definitely  have preferred the sixth story to have been a Chakotay adventure while he  was with the Maquis, with Tom Paris, B'Elanna, Tuvok, Seska, possibly Ro  Laren, and/or Tom Riker.  I think Chakotay and Ro Laren would have made  quite an interesting couple!  I didn't think Christopher Pike really  belonged in this series, although his adventure was a good one. I don't  really consider him a large part of the Star Trek universe.  Even Kasidy  Yates would have been a better choice for a novel. Therefore I took away a  star.	2000-08-28

Nina is at the top of her form as she struggles to defend Nikki, a  friend of her son's.  Nikki, although a sympathetic character, is not a  terribly likeable one, but her mother Daria, a total airhead, has driven  her to take over the household.  Uncle Bill, the victim, is a totally  reprehensible character; his widow Beth, Daria's sister, appears to have  some sort of hidden agenda.  I found Paul's investigation of the plane  crash which killed Beth &amp; Bill's only child, Chris, one of the most  fascinating aspects of this book.  The killer and the motive did surprise  me.  I wish there had been a little more of the courtroom action.  I  couldn't put it down.	2000-08-22

I was a bit disappointed that Ael was not the Romulan Commander of  TEI, but she was an unforgettable character (and the aunt of the original  Romulan commander, which does figure into the plot).  The book offers great  insights into the Romulan character and their views of honor which appear  to be similar to those of the Federation &amp; the Klingons.  I don't  really care for battle scenes, which is the only reason I deducted a star.   But it was a great read, &amp; I could not put it down.  I'd love to hear  more about Ael and some of her crew members that I came to know &amp;  admire.  The Horta ensign is a nicely done character, as well.	2000-08-07

Vir has always been my favorite character.  It is very sad to realize that he must lose his innocence and, yes, some of his soul, in hopes of saving  his world and his people.  Yet he does what he must with great courage and  fortitude and more intelligence than I had given him credit for.  I am a  little disappointed in some of the things he says to the other characters  (G'Kar, for instance), but it does ring true.  It's good to see Garibaldi,  G'Kar, and Galen (the 3 G's!) back in this novel and to learn a little more  about the Technomages. I could not put this book down and look forward to  reading the final volume in this trilogy (although I wish that, like the  Star Trek books, the next one would come out in a month).  I would also  like to see Vir take Senna as his empress.  How about it, Peter David?	2000-05-15

Also the issue of women's total subjugation to men and  their desire for freedom or at least for equality comes into play.  The  murder is almost a McGuffin to lead into these matters.  Caroline Ellison  Fielding, Charlotte Pitt's mother, plays a very prominent role, as does  Mariah Ellison, her hateful mother-in-law.  Charlotte and Gracie do not  appear except in Charlotte's letters to her husband and in Sgt. Tellman's  thoughts of Gracie, whom he has come to love.  Lady Vespasia makes a brief  but welcome appearance.  Tellman, Caroline, and even Mariah learn some  valuable lessons and continue to grow as human beings.  And Cecily Antrim  is a fascinating character.  All in all, one of Perry's best.	2000-04-08

It is weighted too heavily on the  Original Series.  Of course I expected more original series than Voyager, I  had thought there would be a better balance.  I faithfully watched every  episode &amp; every movie, but, to be honest, I now prefer the later  series.  The Next Generation, with 7 years of shows &amp; 2 1/2 movies, is  now the flagship of Star Trek.  Voyager, of course, is the only show still  in production.  There should have been more from Voyager &amp; Deep Space  Nine &amp; less of The Original Series, at least in my opinion.  But it is,  of course, enjoyable.  My favorite excerpt is from Q in Law.  Hilarious!	1999-08-01

Will Riker's clone Tom Riker is also seen between his appearances on TNG and his return as a Maquis on DS9.  They join forces to  help conquer a plague on a former Federation planet ceded to the  Cardassians.  The planet is almost entirely populated with genetic hybrids,  who practically worship B'Elanna, as she is a Klingon-Human hybrid herself.   Tuvok comes to an appreciation of Chakotay and the others, while Seska's  actions hint at the future betrayal to come.  I would love to see another  Maquis book in the near future.	1999-07-05

With the help of her Bajoran ex-husband, a dedicated Cardassian  doctor, and a few Starfleet medical personnel, she works to find a cure,  despite Gul Dukat's concern to protect his position.  Kira Nerys, at this  time a Bajoran freedom fighter, and Odo also take part.  Quark, Rom, &amp;  Nog provide a little comic relief, &amp; Picard &amp; Crusher appear  briefly.  Again, the science is not too difficult for someone with little  background to follow.  This novel does borrow from the previous one to a  small extent, but it can stand alone.  Red Sector, next in the series,  would appear to feature Ambassador Spock and Dr. McCoy.  I enjoyed this  book very much.	1999-06-03

Some stories continue plots from prior series; a Voyager story is a follow-up to an original series show, while  another follows one from The Next Generation.  Dr. McCoy makes an  appearance in a Next Gen story and a Voyager story, while Chakotay and the  EMH both appear in Next Gen stories. Fans of Deep Space Nine will be  disappointed, as neither of the stories ostensibly from that series really  deals with any of the characters.  Only Sisko &amp; Odo are even mentioned.  Reg Barclay makes two appearances; so do the Time Cops Dulmer &amp; Lucsly.  Lt. Saavik, Dr. Pulaski, &amp; Carol Marcus also appear. To me the best  story was Triptych, the second prize winner.  A Ribbon for Rosie &amp; I Am  Klingon (first &amp; third respectively) are also outstanding. I would  recommend this book for any Star Trek fan.  It is much more fun to read  than Dyson Sphere!	1999-04-27

I did not feel that Molly's amnesia was satisfactorily explained, but she herself was a very sympathetic character. Fran was the  typical spunky Clark heroine; I liked her a lot.  I agree that the ending  was a little weak, and I felt the ending was wrapped up a little too fast.   Nonetheless, it had its share of memorable characters.  I would recommend  it.	1999-04-25

Sergeant Tellman, his aide in investigating this case, &amp;  the Pitts' maid Gracie play major parts well.  I wanted their relationship  (reminiscent of the earlier one between Pitt &amp; Miss Charlotte Ellison)  to move on to the next level.  Aunt Vespasia Cumming-Gould also plays a  large part in spite of her age and her growing frailty.  General Ballantyne  and his insufferable wife Augusta are just as we remember them from two  previous books.  His fondness for Charlotte is touching and even sad.  My  only complaint would be that the other characters (aside from Commissioner  Cornwallis) are not as fleshed out as they might be.  I also was a step  ahead of Pitt, but that was because I knew what he knew and also what  Charlotte knew.  The identity of the murderer does come as a surprise, and  the underlying motivation reflects on one of the social ills of the time,  as do all of Perry's novels, Inspector Monk's as well as the Pitts'.  I  found it hard to put this book down and enjoyed it very much.	1999-04-02
