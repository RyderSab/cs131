Libby, the funky dresser turned designer, appears to be a friend--if you're interested in a one-dimensional, self-absorbed artist for a friend.  Dennis is the successful entrepreneur.  His store, Brookhoppers, caters to the affluent fly fisherman.  Dennis, their guru, is one of the town's few black residents, accustomed to near-offensive remarks and gestures meant to prove non-prejudice.<br />Because of the title I expected something about the courting routines of men.  But this was really the story of non-acheiving Melinda plodding along in life, hoping for a long-term, meaningful relationship.  It should be no surprise then that she and Dennis just kind of meld into one, without much strain or effort.	2001-01-08

According to this story, the woman loves her daughter and expects her new husband to do the same.  But she also expects him to keep his life with his daughter seperate from theirs.<br />Peter's daughter, Amanda, is deeply affected by her parents' divorce.  She despises both her mother and father and resents her new step-mother, Emma.  But resentment barely describes her feelings for Emma's daughter, Tess, who now lives full-time with Amanda's father.<br />For her part, Emma makes attempts to bring Amanda in to the family circle, but they are attempts on her terms.  For example, she decorates a room for Amanda, but it's decorated to Emma's tastes.<br />The main failing of this book is the weak characters.  I know nothing of what brought Peter and Emma together.  Why did they feel a second marriage could work?  Why did they feel their children would adjust and they could build a happy life together?<br />I also found the writing weak.  Each time a character was introduced, it was a programmed description of height, hair, clothes, etc.  &quot;Emma's mother, Aline, was also tall, but slightly stooped...Her eyes were blue, her cheeks full and pink.  She had a small bow-shaped mouth and fine light straying hair.  They [Emma's parents] were in their mid-sixties; both wore khaki pants, blue sneakers, sweaters.&quot;  Boring!	2000-12-10

Vangie Nepper finds they know her business before she does.  They know that her pharmacist husband, Henry, is fooling around with his soda girl.  They know that Olive Nepper, Vangie and Henry's daughter, lies in the community hospital, comatose and pregnant.<br />Life in 1952 is orderly and wholesome--at least for appearance sake.  But as told by its citizens, life is hardly pious and sedate in Limoges.  Adultry, wife-beating, false preachers, and of course, gossip color the town.<br />It is the gossip aspect that keeps the pace of the story.  Like the good people of Limoges, the reader yearns for more of the story.  Because the characters are so splendidly defined, the reader wants to know all motivations, all nuances.<br />Though more sexually explicit than I prefer, it's still a captivating story that the reader reluctantly lets go.  And the recipes are a deft touch.	2000-12-10

At 46 he's on the brink of losing his home and business and Sian is an unexpected bright hope.<br />For her part, Sian has had her share of tragedy.  She's lost a son and is trapped in an empty marriage.  Her release has been her poetry.  It is the latest volume that brings Charles back to her life.<br />The early stirrings of romance are light and teasing--a series of short letters traded back and forth.  The inevitable must happen though and Charles and Sian agree to meet.  Naturally the one meeting leads to a desire for intimacy.  They give in.<br />At the point where the two lovers decide to leave their respective marriages and forge their own, tragedy strikes (as it always will when innocents are hurt).  In a Romeo and Juliet moment, one lover dies thinking they've been discarded by the other.  And of course, things have moved beyond the possibility of restoring previous relationships.

Johnnie Mae is a natural-born swimmer: sleek and graceful, as powerful in her strokes as the water around her.<br />But water also brings tragedy as the mighty Potomac lays claim to her young sister, Clara.  Feeling responsible, Johnnie Mae struggles with life.  It is unclear, however, whether this struggle is due to Clara's death or coming of age.<br />Because this is a snapshot, we see the people in the picture, but we don't know much about them beyond what we see.  The story lacks connectedness.  The incident of Clara's drowning is simply an episode in each character's life.  The feeling that Clara's death had an impact is lost--even on Johnnie Mae.

But the year profiled in this book provides her with little order.  Rue moves from death to staff changes to disruptive children to personal and professional dilema.<br />Each chapter of the profile is told in seasoned detail (though the constant point of view shifts are distracting and annoying) but they each seem to be their own story.

Twelve-year-old Natalie accepts the challenge and eventually infiltrates the exclusive Inn.<br />And if that was the end of the story, it really wouldn't be much of a story.  But the author lets a series of minor details build to a coincidental turnabout.<br />Natalie's entry to the Inn is through Robin Fife, a dull fellow summer camper.  She accompanies Robin's family on their annual trip to Lake Devine.  Natalie searches for understanding from the owners and befriends the husband and alienaates the wife and daughter.  She finds tolerance masks unfounded prejudices.<br />Over the years Robin drops from Natalie's life until the promise of a camp reunion brings back the memories.  In the delightful twist of details, the reunion is cancelled for lack of participation.  But this is the detail that puts Robin back in Natalie's life.  The cancelled reunion results in a directory that indicates that Robin works in Natalie's neighborhood.  They meet up and Natalie once again gets herself invited to the Inn--to attend Robin's wedding to one of the owners' sons.<br />Though tragedy cancels the wedding, Natalie remains at the Inn--part-guest, par-chef--and strikes a friendship that ultimately leads to the Inn's closing and new ownership.<br />This is a funny, yet touching, book.  And it's all set up so wonderfully--in real-life moments that you think don't matter.  Until you reflect on the big picture and see how it was crafted to fit together.

Their mother and grandmother lean on the teachings of the Catholic Church.  And their father reinforces unyielding opinions of masculinity and women's roles.  The children retreat: Abby to a dark breakdown and years of living in the &quot;third person;&quot; Sam simply disappears.<br />As her pregnancy progresses, Abby forces herself to face the life in the past, hoping to find keys to better parenthood and to resolve the mystery of her brother's disappearance.  <br />This isn't a book of deep revelation.  It's more of an intellectual journey as Abby searches for truth in the past.  She knows Sam was not simply a misguided teenager--he was troubled and capable of terrifying deeds.  This sensitive study of family dynamics ends with a powerful statement on faith.

Right from the start it drew me in and held me spellbound as young Chiyo was sold to the Kyoto geisha.  The meat of the novel is the early years--the time spent as a virtual slave to the mistress of the geisha house.  Though she is beautiful, it is determined that Chiyo will never become a geisha.  She is cunning, and her attempts to escape cost her &quot;house&quot; much.  Chiyo will never be able to pay her debts.<br />But the inspiration of a gracious businessman and the intervention of a mentor-geisha (bent on revenge toward a competitor)change Chiyo's bad fortune.  The beautiful geisha, Mameha, proposes a business offer to Mother, Chiyo's housemother--a bet that Chiyo, under Mameha's tutorage will pay her debts by age 20.  The greedy Mother accepts the bet and Chiyo becomes a geisha apprentice.<br />There is a love story here as Sayuri, nee Chiyo, strives to win the affections of the kind businessman, the Chairman.  The trials of war and the rebuilding of Japan nearly ruin the geisha trade, but Sayuri makes a come back, along with her country.<br />In the beginning I feared the cultural differences would cause me to lose interest.  Quite the opposite!  I was fascinated with the geisha culture.  I'd assumed that geisha were high-class call girls.  While they did strive to be &quot;kept women&quot;, geisha were so much more.  They were trained entertainers, party hostesses, and escorts.  They were welcomed in businesses for the clientele they'd attract.  Very rarely did they sell themselves for sex--except to their danna (their benefactor).  <br />I loved the economics of geisha: who got paid by whom, who owned what, and oddest yet, the value of kimonos.  The art of dressing the geisha, the training, the discipline and obedience--it was an enlightening look at a culture I'd know nothing of.  So glad I do now.	2000-11-01

My mother gave them to me.  They are too small, but I am running out of things she touched to put next to me.&quot;  &quot;I have started my period and I am alone...I lay my hand across my stomach, feel the outline of the belt.  Just making sure.  It's always that way with the biggest things: they never feel real.  You have to keep on checking them forever.&quot;<br />The contrast of child-to-adult thinking sears the story of a young girl who can't connect with her surviving, sometimes abusive, parent.  She is left to find her own way.  She is durable.	2000-10-28

The place is spiced up when vagabond Vena Takes Horse appears (followed shortly by another refugee, Bui Khanh), but the story needs more than a dash of seasoning.<br />The flyleaf reads, &quot;the characters who drift in and out of the Honk...&quot;  That aptly describes the characters: they drift in and out.  It makes for a jumble of a story and leaves the reader constantly wondering how their circumstances tie together.  Other than the restaurant, there seemed to be no common thread. It's hard to avoid comparison of the solid, passionate characters of  WHERE THE HEART IS with the stick figures of THE HONK AND HOLLER.

The connection through the years is the apartment monstrosity Stefan built in small-town New Hampshire,  a symbol of his success in America. The Wasserburg is built with money borrowed, but never paid back, from his wealthy in-laws.  It is this conflict that sets the story in motion--a story of a house destined to bring pain to succeeding generations of Blaus.  Using the house to cheat others is the only theme I could find.  Stefan's third wife, Helene, cheats her step-children of their inheritance.  Helene's son, Robert, cheats his half-brother and sister.  Robert's daughter, Emma, cheats her mother and brother.  As interesting as this sounds, it was quite dull because it lacked drama.  And there was no drama because the characters were not developed.  Unlike the memorable characters of STONES FROM THE RIVER, the ensemble of VISION fails to stir compassion from the reader.	2000-10-27

While the others may refer to an episode, the reader only gets one person's perspective of the incident.  A perplexity pervaded as to how the story tied together.  By the end of the book, the conclusion was that the story is how the time in the Congo affected the futures of the Price women.<br />Recently it was suggested that this is more of a literary work--the richness of the words and the pictures they paint are the story.

The crushing blow is the betrayal of her husband, Luke, a man she's come to love though she knows the feelings are not reciprocal.<br />It's a compelling story, but disappointing.  Unfortunately I smelled the trap of the &quot;romance novel&quot; as it was set.  And sure enough, when it was sprung, it was a dull snap.  <br />This book lacked the surprise twists that mark Sandra Dallas' other novels.

I felt deeply for the main character, Florida &quot;Grace,&quot; as she moved through a troubled childhood of religious fanatacism, to marriage and children, to walking out on the marriage to take up with a stoned painter.  It's a book of self-discovery and forgiveness.<br />Grace grows up in a home of mixed-up worship.  Her mother, Fannie, worships her father as her savior.  And her father, a serpent-handling evangelist, worships himself.  Jesus gets all mixed up in it, leaving Grace to doubt her fundementalist upbringing and subsequent marriage.  She turns to a total opposite--a godless self-indulgent handyman.  She learns of drugs and alcohol, and of course, that life fails her too.<br />The ending left some questions.  It was very easy to read suicide into the scenerio.  Grace was called to join her dead mother.  But I believe it was actually a re-birth.  She joined her mother in the body of Christ.  It was His call she heard and obeyed--a relationship that wouldn't fail her.	2000-10-15

Knowing little about motorcycles and even less about biker bars, it was a great introduction to that world.<br />This book screams for an editor--someone to put the Thesaurus back on the shelf, someone to suggest more natural turns-of-phrase.  However, the story doesn't need much work.  The many twists did not lead where I expected--except the last turn.  The ending was contrived.  The suspense ended with a laugh.	2000-10-14

Taking place in the early 60s, it's supposed to paint a picture of these pampered young women and the dilemma of a changing society--one where polished social graces and charm are no longer required or respected.  Tragic, huh?  <br />It's actually the story of spoiled, self-absorbed teenagers.

She is distracted by family (husband and two children) as well as the characters of the novel.  These interruptions show the proces of writing as the characters question and argue with the writer.<br />There is a story told---Megan, the young mother is bored and/or overwhelmed by her life.  She walks away from it for a rest, a re-examination.  There is no great conclusion reached though.  It is the intrusions that carry the story.  The intrusions are life, because life does not proceed along a well-defined track.  Things always obstruct the track.  And Megan learns that no matter how well she plans ahead and imagines outcomes, intrusions will alwaus change and direct the outcome.	2000-10-13

Significant capsules of the lives of women who influence her life (her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother) are woven in.  <br />This is a British novel, told in a British voice that is at times difficult to understand (not knowing the jargon and the &quot;mixed up&quot; quotation marks) that moves from turn of the century (20th) through two World Wars to the 60s and then present day.<br />There is a secret in Ruby's family--one involving Ruby, but kept from her.  There are hints from cousins, overheard remarks from aunties, but Ruby dismisses then as &quot;confusion&quot;--people mixing up the events of her family history.  But following a bitter accusation, she searches for the shoeless shoebox in her mother's closet, she knows she has confirmation of an evil deed.<br />When the secret is revealed, she confronts her dying mother: why was it never spoken of? Ruby then learns of her mother's sorrow and protective love.	2000-10-13

It's a good book, though difficult to read at times--it really requires concentration through sometimes dull narrative.<br />I liked that the heroine, Lidie Newton, was a plain, less-than-extraordinary-looking young woman.  Not the beautiful, chaste, virginal character dependant upon a man to solve life's problems.  Quite the opposite.  In fact, Lidie displays incredible strength when she poses as a man in an attempt to find her husband's murderer.<br />There are times when this story drags, but stick with it...we need to be reminded of the struggles against oppression that most of us have never experienced.	2000-10-11

The foot-journey &quot;east of the mountains&quot; allows him to reflect on his past--his family history, his one true love Rachel, his medical career.<br />And the turning point comes with a birth.  Called upon to assist with a difficult delivery, he witnesses the struggle for life.  His efforts save both the mother and infant.  &quot;Things looked different now.&quot;<br />A great story of self-discovery.  And the reminder that self-discovery is a life-long quest.	2000-10-11

You knew the people who lived around you; you knew their schedules; you knew their idosyncrasies.  All because these people were so much like you.  It was a predictable and comfortable life.<br />But if that safety net was ripped apart, you found how completely different your neighbors were from you.  <br />And this is what 9-year-old Marsha discovers the summer a boy is murdered in her neighborhood.  Suddenly crime and betrayal surround her.  The unfamiliar invites invention and Marsha creates a murder scenario that falsely accuses the neighborhood's newcomer.<br />This is a good story, but the style of telling it denies the reader the thrill of suspense and discovery.  Events are introduced not to foreshadow, but to tell the outcome.  Early on, page 8 to be exact, we learn that the murder is never solved.  Though this is not the story of a crime, this detail spoils the underlying story of Marsha's invention.	2000-10-11

It is a tale of healing: physically and mentally, human and animal.<br />Fifteen-year-old Grace is a victim of a horrific accident involving a semi and two horses (the best descriptive of an accident, though quite gory).  Grace witnesses the death of a friend and the mutiltaion of her horse.  She is changed.<br />Her mother, headstrong Annie, seeks healing for both her daughter and the injured, scarred horse.  She learns of the traditions of Horse Whisperers--talented men who see into the soul of a horse.  She learns of such a man, a western man, Tom Booker.  She packs up her daughter and horse and trailers across the country to meet Booker.  Should also menton that she leaves her loving husband, Grace's father, to make this journey.<br />The story of the healing of Grace and her horse, Pilgrim, is very touching.  But it is ruined by the silly love story that develops between Booker and Annie.  Despite antagonistic presonalities, they fall in love and follow their hearts because &quot;if it feels right, it must be right.&quot;  This storyline is so predictable.  Anyone who's seen an episode of any soap opera could tell you that opposing personalities eventually end up in bed.	2000-10-11

War, fame, marriage, and love came and went.  What never changed was the bond she shared with her two best friends, Effa Commander and Whippy Bird (what names!).  When scandal, murder, and betrayal made a legend of Mae Anna, only her friends could set the record straight.<br />Told by Effa Commander, the story weaves personal details of the other lives into the &quot;story behind the legend.&quot;  Though Effa Commander and Whippy Bird remain hometown girls, the code of their friendship marks them as the real heroes of the story--not the beautiful Mae Anna, Hollywood's Marion Street.<br />This is an extremely touching book.  The simple characters, Effa Commander and Whippy Bird, are of course the richest.  They humbly live through their own personal tragedies and still find the courage to remain steadfast to their &quot;weaker&quot; friend.	2000-10-11

Convinced that Ethan is the perfect father candidate (if not the perfect husband candidate), she talks him into sleeping with her just one more time.

Gene admired Finny--almost to the point of worshiping him.  Over the summer session at school, though, he realized that Finny felt threatened by  him.  Although Finny was the gifted sportsman, he knew that Gene also had  athletic talent.  And he knew that Gene was the superior intellect.  Finny  knew that Gene was &quot;one better&quot; than him.  This set up a conflict  that I expected to build to explosion over the summer.  Instead, an  innocent prank turned the course of the story and it was difficult to tell  where the author was going.  Clearly Gene was responsible for the accident,  and because he didn't confess, I expected the new course to follow the  tension that was bound to build until he was exposed.  Instead, the story  was more a chronicle of the school year--friendships formed, subjects  studied, and plans for military enlistment.	1999-03-08

Divorce makes her different; none of the other Hemlock Street  mothers even know a divorced person.  There is an unspoken fear that  accepting her will accept the change that is certain to happen in the  neighborhood. We assume that life was tidy in the '50s.  This book reveals  what we know is really true.  Life never moves unendingly on the same  track.  Change is always a part of life.  Even though the '50s were sedate,  change happened throughout the entire decade.  The Hemlock Street neighbors  fought unsuccessfully against the threat of change that they perceived Nora  would bring.  In truth, they each formed a monumental change in their own  lives and, of course, in the life of the neighborhood.	1999-02-25
