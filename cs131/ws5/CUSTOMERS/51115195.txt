We are a long way from the &quot;life on any terms&quot; message of the  later works.  Otherwise, this second novel by Zola contains many of the  themes that were to come to fruition in his great masterpieces and is a big  improvement on his first as far as character portrayal is concerned.  &quot;Madeleine Frat&quot; is a proper book, rather than a movie script.  As a purely naturalist work it is a step backwards, because the characters  are not really playthings of their environment in the way that those in the  first novel are - not to mention the creatures in the Rougon-Macquart  cycle. Nowadays, the story's ending must seem far-fetched and dated, though  it may well have seemed very moving up to the end of, say, the 1950s. The  shame felt by the heroine at marrying her first lover's best friend is  understandable up to a point, but despite Zola's efforts it is too  inconsistent with the strong-mindedness he has given her in the earlier  chapters. It would be interesting, too, to hear what modern feminists think  of his theory that a woman bears the indelible psychological and  pathological imprint of her first lover. However, this book is a rewarding  read because it shows Zola still seeking an artistic direction for his  literary career, and for this reason alone it deserves to be better known  than it is. Worse stories than this have found their way on to the screen,  and in his own writings Zola was to get worse before getting better and  finding the niche that brought him lasting fame.	1999-12-29

A series of lightweight, romantic fairy stories written in a very fluid and pleasing style but with very little substance, other than a prophetic (to  our eyes) warning of the importance of China and some cynical and  perceptive remarks on running a country - both in the longest of the tales  - and certainly no hint of the gritty, down-to-earth dramas to come in the  years ahead. Good of their kind but they follow a path well trodden by  generations of earlier writers and their main interest is in showing just  how much Zola developed during his career as a writer.	1999-12-28

It has in fact been a great favourite with film makers over the years: versions were made in  1928, 1953 (with Simone Signoret and Raf Vallone), 1965, 1980 (both as  serials for TV) - and there is apparently a new film in production due for  release next year and starring Kate Winslet, no less. The book has a  doom-laden plot line that may remind many readers of an early Hitchcock  film, but it is quite short for a Zola work and fairly pacy most of the  time. The alternate titles for the 1928 film give you an idea of what to  expect: &quot;Shadows Of Fear&quot; and &quot;Thou Shalt Not Commit  Adultery&quot; The psychological motivation side is sometimes a bit weak  and contrived and reads more like a set of instructions for actors, but  this was the guy's first attempt at a full-length novel and people did  think differently in 1867. A good introduction to Zola if you're curious  about him and can't face the thought of the usual 500-page epic.	1999-12-09

After 30 years of scientific and genealogical research,  a doctor in his late 50s decides his life is meaningless without children and accepts his 25-year old niece's offer to have his child. He dies of a  heart attack, and his mother manages to destroy all his papers except his  family tree diagram. This, the last in the 20-book Rougon-Macquart cycle  was described by Zola himself as the summary and the conclusion of his  work. Intellectually, it is highly adventurous in parts, even by today's  standards, but it seems to fall flat at the end with its implication that  the whole point of life is simply to breed and pass on your genes. You  could say this book is the ultimate hymn to occupational therapy. However  lofty a view human beings may have of themselves and their activities, they  are really no different from any other form of life.	1999-12-06

Ideally suited for the big screen, though in fact never filmed, the story's  epic sweep and tragic ironies have been much copied by later writers and  are now all too familiar to twentieth century readers of war novels.  Unfortunately, most modern readers will not read this book as it is about  the French, and many French people won't read it because it is about their  country's defeat and the chaotic military disorganization that preceded it.  A pity really, because this novel helps explain the French attitudes  towards Germany that dominated their thinking for the first half of the  twentieth century and helped lead to the First World War and the rise of  Hitler.	1999-11-11

Nothing has really  changed since it was written over a hundred years ago. Read it and you may  avoid losing your life savings in some scam or other, or you may find some  ideas for a scam of your own. You would not be the first, if some recent  scandals are anything to go by. If you're Jewish you may not like some of  the remarks made by the book's main character, Aristide, but remember  Zola's honourable role in the Dreyfus affair only a few years later.

A thousand years later Zola took some 250 pages to update the story and add a wealth of naturalist and  spiritual detail, which still makes it only half the usual length of his  offerings. &quot;The Dream/Le Rve&quot; is a fairy story written in  response to outraged criticism of the &quot;bestiality&quot; of &quot;The  Earth/La Terre&quot;. So, it is the one Zola book that it is safe to read  to children at bedtime, especially if they have trouble going to sleep. As  an introduction to the legends of the saints and a guidebook to the stone  carvings on church doors it is first class. Pure in heart, morally  uplifting and barely a whiff of hereditary vice, the book concocts for  itself only the most tenuous of links with the Rougon-Macquart family,  whose doings dominate this 20-novel saga, and then promptly buries the  connection for the tale's duration. If nothing else, &quot;The Dream&quot;  proves that Zola is a versatile writer. Try reading it after &quot;The  Earth&quot; and before tackling &quot;The Beast In Man/La Bte  Humaine&quot; and then think about Shakespeare's famous remark about what a  many-splendoured work is man (meaning human beings in general).	1999-10-08

It may sound corny, but if ever a book was &quot;earthy&quot;, this one certainly is. Many people, including Zola's fellow naturalists, have been disgusted by the scenes of rape, murder and  general bad behaviour in it, but in fact none of them are included solely  for their shock effect. The characters are all too true to life, and  although they may be brutish, they are not all stupid, as is shown in the  cafe discussions about the agricultural market and the threat from cheap  American grain imports (remember, this is in the 1860s). One of the few  Zola books where the member of the Rougon-Macquart family in it is not one  of the main characters, and in fact his role in the action is almost  accidental. For him, and perhaps for most readers, the farmers are aliens  from another world but this book is an excellent work and one of Zola's  best, though it may make you think twice about buying that nice little  house in the country, especially in France.	1999-10-07

But gradually the doctor comes  to love the widow for her calm and dignity and turns away from his society  hostess of a wife - with ultimately tragic consequences. A well-crafted  story with short chapters and leaning heavily on character portrayal for  its effect. Very untypical Zola, the novel seems to be written as a  breathing space between &quot;L'Assommoir&quot; and &quot;Nana&quot; to  cash in on Zola's new-found fame, avoid being typecast as a muck-racker and  to show that even respectable, well-off people living in a prosperous  neighbourhood and minding their own business can be waylaid and thrown into  turmoil by love's passion. The story also ties up a loose end in a minor  branch of the Rougon-Macquart dynasty, though the heroine ultimately  receives less drastic treatment from the author than her two brothers. The  impression from this book is more that of the &quot;stiff upper lip&quot;  than the &quot;blood and guts&quot; you normally expect from Zola and it is  probably the best of this type in the 20-novel cycle.	1999-10-07

It is also interesting to see what became of Claude, the carefree  painter glimpsed briefly in &quot;Le Ventre De Paris/The Underbelly Of  Paris&quot; and contrast his fate with that of his younger brother,  Etienne, from the previous Rougon-Macquart volume, the blockbuster  &quot;Germinal&quot;. Zola's cameo role in the plot as the writer, Sandoz,  helps provide stability as the various characters inevitably break down  under the pressure and anguish of artistic creation or compromise their  ideals for worldly riches. However, the ending tends to undermine the whole  book. The story goes on for too long (even beyond the end of the Second  Empire itself, which Zola gave himself as the time-span of the  Rougon-Macquarts' activities). It seems as if the writer did not know how  to end his tale, so after several false build-ups we are left with a  suicide by hanging as in the twelfth volume in the series. A good read on  the whole, but this book could have been even better.	1999-10-07

Take John  Steinbeck's &quot;The Grapes Of Wrath&quot;, multiply it by ten or twenty  and you won't even come close to this book. Deeply moving, shocking, but  ultimately uplifting, for in the wreckage of the miners' crushing defeat  after their strike Zola, for once, offers a glimmer of hope.

In a way, you could say it's a forerunner of &quot;Lady  Chatterley's Lover&quot; with the sexes reversed. A young and very devoted  priest is nursed back to health after illness and has his sensual passions  aroused in a big way by a teenage girl living virtually alone in a huge,  century-old abandoned walled garden. Add to this a fire-and-brimstone  friar, an intellectually-challenged younger sister, a kindly doctor of an  uncle and the earthy animal spirits of southern French country life as a  background to it all and you have something special, even if the final  outcome of the love affair is unbelievable. Full of poetry, passion,  symbolism and Zola's usual intoxicating powers of description, but not the  book you'll find serialized in your local church magazine. Well worth  reading as it shows that Zola's craft as a writer has fully matured but he  has yet to find the subject to hit the big time sales-wise.	1999-10-06

The book is a non-stop catalogue  of the blows that life hands out to a sweet orphan girl sent to live with  distant relatives in a seaside village. Even the servant of the household  feels obliged, in the end, to commit suicide because of the treatment  suffered by the girl, who is without doubt Zola's most sweet-natured  creation and sails through the whole story with her caring instincts  completely untouched. Everything is well described, as always, but for me  the story is only interesting if you want to find out what happened to  Pauline, the daughter of Lisa in &quot;Le Ventre De Paris/The Underbelly Of  Paris&quot;, and in the Rougon-Macquart saga this book is like the low  point on a suspension bridge between the twin towers of &quot;Au Bonheur  Des Dames/The Ladies' Paradise&quot; and &quot;Germinal&quot;. Fans of  Monty Python's Flying Circus who have seen the film &quot;The Life Of  Brian&quot; might well recall the song sung on the cross by Brian  &quot;Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life&quot; and that just about sums  up what I felt after reading this gloomy tale.	1999-10-05

It shows the hollowness and shabbiness behind the glittering  facade of state power and the motives that drive people to go into politics  - in France at least. But as the main character has no other aim than  simply to wield authority over others and is perfectly willing to  contradict all his previous declarations of principle to retain this  authority, the book tends to leave the reader in a depressed and cynical  state, and this may be why its sales were among the lowest of Zola's  Rougon-Macquart cycle. One might expect the main character, as the eldest  son of the legitimate Rougon line, to have something more to offer, but the  dryness of the subject chosen is too much for even Zola to overcome.

This book breaks new ground in its portrayal of the lives of the &quot;little people&quot; of Paris, its detailed descriptions of food and, most of all,  its use of a city district - rather than human beings - as its main  character. Zola himself had great affection for it. You feel his nostalgia  for his difficult early days in the capital. But ultimately the book  doesn't quite gell. The famous descriptions, while being jewels in  themselves, actually get in the way of the action. The plot could have been  more sharply focused and, perhaps the most curious thing of all, the main  human character, Florent, is only a member by marriage of the  Rougon-Macquart family which the cycle of novels is about. The  &quot;real&quot; member of the family, Lisa, has a remarkably peripheral  role. Also, the book could have been made a lot shorter. But it is still  rewarding for the reader because, after dealing with provincial intrigue  and the capital's fat cats in his first two novels, Zola takes his first  stab at portraying the people that were ultimately to make his reputation:  the &quot;lower orders&quot;.	1999-09-03

Read one of two of the &quot;masterpieces&quot; first to get an idea of the man's true worth. Then come back to this book. Its main interest is as a  &quot;who's who&quot; of Zola's characters, a family tree, a quick  refresher when you read later novels in the Rougon-Macquart cycle. Compared  to the later works, it seems to be written too much to a formula. Very much  a &quot;warm-up&quot; exercise for the author's social and historical  project. Chapters and descriptions are far too long and the effect of  environment on human character - a favourite theme of the naturalists - is  often unclear. The shallowness of those who seize political power is fairly  well portrayed, though less skillfully than in Zola's later offerings. His  main themes are all here but in embryonic form. He's groping his way.  Fortunately, he didn't give up and battled on until he hit the jackpot with  lucky number seven. Frankly, the book is only for hardened Zola nuts, who  know where the man's heading. But it was intended to be an introduction to  a cycle, and if you read it on those terms it's just about OK. A sort of  boot camp. The Z-boy does show some promise here, and there's already a big  improvement in book number two. So grit your teeth and stick with it.	1999-08-27

People may wonder nowadays whatever led to the temperance movement and the prohibition experiment. Look no further than this book. It catapulted Zola to stardom and so impressed the public that, after moving pictures were  invented in 1895, three film versions of the story were made before the  First World War, and even Hollywood borrowed the basic plot for &quot;The  Lost Weekend&quot; in 1945. Don't think it just describes French society.  Next time you drop into your favourite bar, look around you and imagine  where your fellow customers will be in twenty years time. Then go out and  buy some liquor stocks, because people never learn, so why not get your  hands on some of those booze profits. If you only read one French novel in  your life, read this one. You'll never be the same again.	1999-08-19

They are all here: loss leaders, careful product placement to  prompt &quot;impulse&quot; buying of unnecessary items and all based on the  flightiness of female nature learnt by the store owner in the previous  volume &quot;Pot-Bouille&quot;. And to round it all off, we have the  classic message &quot;money can't buy me love&quot;, though the ending  hints that the male and female lead may yet &quot;come together&quot; in  the future. After reading this, and indeed any Zola novel, two thoughts  remain: &quot;it's all been done before&quot; and &quot;there's nothing new  under the sun&quot;. Readers gain an insight into the social forces that  led to so many people supporting trade unions and &quot;left wing  socialist&quot; political views. The book is contemporary to the First  International and Marx's &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. It's not Zola's best  work, but you do realise why Warner Bros thought him worthy of a biopic in  1937.	1999-08-18
