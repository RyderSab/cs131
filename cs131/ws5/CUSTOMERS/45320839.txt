While I did agree with some of the things she had to say such as the need for better daycare for our children.  Another thing I agreed with her about is the fact that most &quot;women&quot; jobs such as teachers and child care providers are underpaid.  But it sounded like she was complaining a lot about how mothers do a lot of the work when it comes to childrearing and housework.  She also discusses how much it's worth for a mom to do all the tasks she needs to do which includes caring for her own children.  I was laughing as I was reading that section because for one, why do think it called household chores? And caring for your own children should not be seen as a task to accomplish but a gift in seeing them grow and become responsible citizens. Another thing she doesn't mention is how about the people who live on their own or couples who are childless?  How much is their &quot;jobs&quot; worth such as doing laundry and cleaning dishes etc. worth yearly?  She doesn't mention too much about the role of Fathers in children's lives.  While I do agree they don't do as much as the mothers, they are getting better about it.  My final note on this book, while I do believe we need to do more for moms, dads, and children, I didn't find this book interesting to read because everyone has do household chores including yardwork etc.  wheather they hire someone or not to get it done.	2002-01-13

In my opinion, a good time to encourage your baby to fall on a routine is around 2 months of age when baby and you are settled in.  I think she does a good job of explaining on how to read your baby's cues.  One of her programs E.A.S.Y. is about getting your baby on a structured routine from day one. (E-Eating, A-Activity, S-Sleep, Y-You)  I do agree with her on how a baby needs to sleep in his/her own bed.  She also mentions that a mom is and should have some &quot;me&quot; time without feeling quilty.  <br />In the book, there are tips throughout the book.  Her other program which discusses your baby's cues is S.L.O.W. (S-Stop, L-Listen, O-Oberve, and W-What's Up)  There is also a chart included which explains a baby's language and facial expression,  <br />In the book, the author also discusses in detail on breastfeeding and bottlefeeding, a section on childproofing and wheather or not to use a pacifier.	2002-01-12

Some activites may require adult supervision while others don't. I recommend this book for children between the ages of 6-18 years. While some activites may be appropriate for a young child, there are activites that are more appropriate for a teenager. While this book has lots of ideas and activities, I felt this book would have been better if the activities were seperated by ages and categories instead of one long list. A sampling of activities includes: learn CPR, illustrate your wall calander, write down your hopes and dreams, make a suggestion to the mayor, make a tower of disposable drinking cups, make up a new card game, cultivate an ant farm, make a salad with 5 ingredients, start a diary you'll really enjoy keeping, make a map of the town, make a &quot;guess the number of&quot; jar and many, many more activities to choose from. While I thought this book was great, I found some activites would be difficult or almost impoosible for a child or teenager to accomplish or some activites that were listed were similar. I also felt some of the activites may be geared to what your child(ren) may be interested in. At the end of the book, it gave a supply list a child may need to accomplish an actvitiy. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for ideas/activities for their child(ren).	2001-12-04
