By this many accounts he begins to end the tradition of oral transmission in the Greek culture, a powerful tradition which was responsible for the preservation to posterity of works of such caliber as the Odyssey and the Iliad, from Ulysses. In Herodotus view, the written report of the many different points of view would adduce credence to the histories. <br />   <br />The main focus of The Histories is on the battles of the Peloponnesus war, and the chapters revolve around the feats of the Persians and Greeks for the supremacy of Europe and Asia Minor. His is a 360 degrees analysis of customs, culture and habits of war and peace of the most variegated people, being him eyewitness to many events reports. Above all, and part of the merit must be given to the excellent translation to English, Herodotus is an expert with words and narrates many pretty interesting tales in a way reminiscent of Arabian nights: the dialogues between Solon the legislator and Croesus, the richest man in the world, the customs of some people who ate their deceased kin, but not if they died sick, the battle between the cavalry of Croesus and the camel riders of Cyrus, the detailed descriptions of the customs of Egypt and the supposition by Herodotus that the Greeks inherited much of their pantheon from them, the origin of the myth of Cyrus having a bitch as a suckling mother (paralleling the myth of the foundation of Rome), and many etceteras.     <br /> <br />I was quite surprised with the overall quality of the book and, mostly, by the many excellent ideas Herodotus gives for each and every act of the likes as Cyrus, Darius, Croesus and many more. His geographical descriptions of each and every territory he interested on, adds luster to his narrative and are not all boring, quite to the contrary, serving always as a background to some historical events he analyses. His demystifying of Greek ideal of being the center of the earth, his projection of the fulfillment of the Red Sea by the Nile water flow in the next 20.000 years gives a vague idea of the man that lies behind the book and who has a lot to teach, even if he does not say so, to future generations, also to our.  <br /> <br />I think that every reader interested in the ideas of great thinkers of the Humanity, should take a look upon Herodotus and his Histories. I am sure he/she will not be disappointed, being the Histories, in my humble opinion, one of the 100 best books to be read.              <br /> <br />  <br />	2004-11-02

The credentials of Walter Kaufmann are impressive, being he one of the most renowned translator of the works of the XIX philosopher, who died in his middle age in a German asylum for insane persons. <br />   <br /> Nietzsche was essentially innovative and a great polemicist in everything he did; the  aphoristic style which permeates all his major works is in the tradition of Socratic minimalist philosophy, never willing to build a philosophical system (like the ones conceived by the likes of Thomas Aquinas and Karl Marx), and then falling prey to the dogmatism of first principle (Creator, First material, past infinity etc.), but trapping himself, it seems rather intentionally, in the ambiguities of language and style. He was accused of being against Jews, in favor of National Socialism, for the supremacy of the Germans as a race and against intra racial marriages, essentially anti-Christian etc.   <br /> <br />The task of the author is to put the record straight and go trough all the maze of documents that constitutes his extensive documented legacy, which, following the author, unfortunately fell in the hands of the most unqualified person to pursue the work of the thinker, his sister, with links to anti-Jewish movements and married to a proto Third Reich supporter. Besides all that, all his major ideas (the overman, recurrent reality, the will to power, just to name a few) are reviewed and collated with the ideas of some of the great philosophers or artists to whom he owns a lot in terms of contributions to the development of his philosophy. Men like Schopenhauer, Hegel, Kant, Socrates, Goethe, Wagner and many more. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, I could think of no book better than this as a means to try to intrude into the life and way of thinking of one of the most prolific and polemical man as Nietzsche was.   <br />             <br />	2004-10-28

I explained her that the Septuagint must be seen rather as a very important historical document, being not, even at the time of its first appearance, circa 170 B.C, subject to any type of such approval, because it was mostly the work of Jewish wise men intent on providing its dispersed people with the sacred content of the Holy Book, being Greek the language of choice even among dispersed Jews, not enough familiar with Hebrew.       <br /> <br />Also worthy of notice is that Septuaginta is a misnomer for 2 reasons: first of all, there were in fact 72 and not 70(then Septuaginta) wise men charged with the task of translation; and secondly, they were devoted to the translation of the Pentateuch (285 BC) , the first 5 books of the Bible, who forms the core of Creationism, being the rest the work of countless people from various origins, as is conveniently explained by the multilingual and very interesting (in Modern Greek, Latin, German and English) prefaces and history of the Septuaginta that initiate the book. The prospective buyer has to take notice that this is only an Old Testament edition. <br /> <br />I would say that this is not standard Greek and you will need sometimes an ecclesiastical Greek dictionary due to the lack of standards in the Greek language. Regarding myself, I am truly satisfied with this Septuagint version, which allows me to compare the Latin texts of the Vulgate edition to this Greek rendition, and for that matter I am not at all disappointed, being given what I exactly asked for in order to practice both ancient Latin as ancient Greek. <br />      <br />	2004-10-05

The book from da Cunha got immediate accolades from critics and public alike, despite the intricacy of da Cunha's vocabulary. Vargas Llosa is said to be fascinated since he was a youth by da Cunha's report of the Brazilian regional intestine war that almost completely disrupted the newly born republican government, given the many battles its powerful army lost to a rag-tag counterpart of thousands homeless people, who obdurately followed a lunatic visionary called Antonio Conselheiro, who tried to revert Brazil to Imperial rule, dark ages style, and, after many years on the run, finally settled down with his poverty stricken retinue in the village of Canudos.  <br /> <br />Almost 90 years after the end of the conflict who claimed thousands of lives in both sides, Vargas Llosa frequently visited the site and cities in the 80's, familiarizing himself with the geography of the place where it all happened, one of the most arid regions of the world, with less than 200 mm of yearly rainfall, to collect personal reports from the poor people who live there and who head the stories told by their ancestors who managed to survive that bloody civil war. Vargas Llosa managed to add a lot of interesting points to the central story by either inventing interesting characters which added weight to the novel: a mysterious English man who shuttle to and from the battle scene as a correspondent to a newspaper, or by portraying in the most faithful way the hard personalities of war commanders who thought from the very first time that war was to be over in a matter of days. Some of them would never return home, their headless bodies being exposed by insurgents throughout theroad that led to Canudos.  <br /> <br />One of the key points of Vargas Llosa's novel is that he adds also a lot of information as background to the conflict and to the book, portraying very acutely the hidden interests of a rural Brazilian aristocracy that had more to lose than to gain with the Republican government. Also of importance, the author writes a book as if he was born in the region, his style (purposefully) being pretty much akin to some famous modern Brazilian authors like, for instance, Jorge Amado.         <br />         <br />         <br />	2004-09-26

Due to the many readings that I do in Latin with quite frequent references to Latin sentences in the Holy Bible, I bought this \\"Biblia Sacra Vulgata\\" to assist me whenever occurred a biblical quotation in Latin. I am presently reading the monumental Suma Teologica, by Thomas Aquinas, some 3.000 pages of Middle Ages Latin and fully populated of biblical references. So, a few hours after receiving the package from Amazon, I got down to business: making a parallel reading in the Biblia Vulgata of  all the sentences in Latin quoted by Saint Thomas.  I was exhilarated by the outcome!!. Ok, this edition is not  exactly the one Saint THomas had to peruse and quote, but all in all, the thing is much better than I thought at the first time and it is worth all the money I invested on it. The sheer pleasure of reading a text translated by Saint Jerome, of reading the prefaces in German, French, English and Latin is something difficult to be equaled by any other opus. Besides all that, this richly printed edition is full of adequately placed footnotes by the editor, with many (all?) references to differences between the many different editions of the Bible. To top it all, the Latin Prefaces by Saint Jerome (c.347-420 A.D.) are purveyors of the strong intensity of the Saint religious passion and thoughts, having the value of his many comments on doctrinal points.<br /><br />The Biblia Vulgata is one of the most important documents of all times, being the all important media that made it possible to Christianity to prevail throughout centuries to come, be it in the form of Roman Catholicism, be it trough the many denominational religions that sprung up as Christian creeds and sects.<br /><br />Written in Latin, it rivals in importance with the Septuaginta, the Tora and the Arabic Coran, and tells the Creationist view of the formation and development of the world.<br /><br />It is mostly the output of an indefatigable man, Saint Jerome, who translatated into Latin many Hebrew texts of the Old Testament, a gigantic task in itself, if we consider that its Greek counterpart, the Septuaginta, was the work of 70 wise men, who, divinely inspired according to tradition, translated Hebrew biblical texts into Greek.<br /><br /> If you are deeply interested in the Latin language, and have good dictionaries that followed the evolvement of Latin since its inception, this is one of the (holy) books you must have.<br /><br /> Valete!!exts of the Old Testament, a gigantic task in itself, if we consider that its Greek counterpart, the Septuaginta, was the work of 70 wise men, who, divinely inspired according to tradition, translated Hebrew biblical texts into Greek. <br /> <br /> If you are deeply interested in the Latin language, and have good dictionaries that followed the evolvement of Latin since its inception, this is one of the (holy) books you must have.    <br /> Valete!!        <br />  <br />	2004-09-25

I did not read yet the book, but I will as soon as I can. For the moment, I would like to share this news with people who loves Latin. Valete.<br /><br />The other day a friend asked me how potato was written in Latin. Yes, Latin, that ancient language that is taken for dead now and was the language of the Roman Empire when Rome conquered the world, some 2.000 +  years ago. I asked the same question to an acquaitance of mine who happens to be an expert on such type of foodstuff and the answer was « sorry, there is no sense in that question : potatoes were first brought to Europe when the Spaniards first settled in America after 1492. Even the etymology of the word is of Centro-american Origin » . He was right !! As happened with syphilis, potato was one of the things the Spaniards brought back home when returning from their conquers. There could not be a word for a thing that did not already exist at the time of the Roman Empire when Latin was at its heyday, not to mention many other things that were not yet discovered, invented or even supposed to exist. Sure, potato was not at all alone in this type of category. The same happened with things or words like astronauts, motorbikes, top-models, typewriters, and many others, just to name a few.<br /><br />To mend the situation and to give a hand to the people that still has to use Latin as it were still a living language, like people from the Vatican bureaucracy that have to write a lot of cannonical stuff in Latin, The Libraria Editoria Vaticana, hired a bunch of scholars, led by the recently deceased great latinist, the Italian Carlo Ergg (Carolus Egger, in Latin). After years of difficult work they constructed this 15.000-word beautifully printed dictionary and formed, out of what seems to be strict Latin rules of formation of words, this very rich (but intrinsically weird) book of what can be called modern Latin words. The edition that I have in my hand is for German speaking enthusiasts of Latin, a sequel to the original one, which was (sure) Italian/Latin. The importance Latin has in German, Austria and some other German language countries is paramount, where it is part of the regular curriculum of any student in his/hers teens for at least 6 years. I have been told that in Italy, all the Exact Sciences students have Latin for some 4 or 5 years, which helps them a lot in the build-up of their logical thinking.<br /><br />Ok, but how is potato to be written in « modern Latin » ? The answer is « tuber solani ». And typewritter ? « mensa scriptoria ». Sex shops ? \\"Rerum obscenarum taberna\\". Astronauts? \\"Nauta sideralis\\". Soccer is \\" folle pedibusque ludo\\".<br /><br />So, besides the seriousness of such a kind of stull, there is some jocular aspects of it, given the gymnastics the word inventors had to perform in order to have their job done. To sum it up, this is one of the weirdst, although pretty much serious word stuff that I have got in my hands in the last years, and I would like to congratulate the people who made it possible to have Latin reinvented and still useful today.

Jeremy Bentham is the father of the doctrine called Utilitarianism, and John Stuart Mill (son of the second-rank philosopher James Mill and a kind of mouthpiece for Jeremy) is his most known disciple. Utilitarianism and other Essays  presents the reader some of the most important and exciting excerpts texts written by the two thinkers, who, despite outwardly embracing the same doctrine, had to do a lot of theoretical gymnastics to accomodate each other points of view under the same ideological umbrella, thus demonstrating that sometimes the battle is fiercest, albeit muffled, inside than outside ideological headquarters. In hindsight , it seems that John Stuart Mill, who ran the rudders of the Economic doctrine of England until the 1860's, had some scores to settle with Jeremy, who was many years his senior and had ben, by some, the person behind the culturally sophisticated (although stripped of any emotional and religious overtones) education John received as a boy,  learning Greek at 3, Latin at 8 and revising at 15 (in French) the first volume of the book  Democracy in America , by Tocqueville. The outcome of all this is that Mill developed a type of melancholic character who almost pushed him to the depths of  depression, only rescued by his second marriage in his mid-life, when he embraced a lot of libertarian and anti-establishment proposals. <br /> The writting styles of the two are blatantly different, James being the pragmatical dogmatist who accepted no exception to his utilitarian praecepts, Mill, on the contrary, the soft-minded scholar who diligently tried to mend the many defficiencies of a theory so rigidly framed and which was supposed to answer to all demands of human action. This dogmatism by Bentham, forced Mill later in life to abscond that doctrine, althoug never converting himself to any religion creed. Worthy of mention if the superb introduction by Alan Ryan, being a book on utilitarianism in itself.     <br />          <br />	2004-09-11

No, my friend. You are not schmuck; in fact, to read in Greek is not among the simplest things in life. So, how could anyone know that letters in Greek, for instance `Y' (gamma) , are not what they seem to be, standing for our roman `G' and being the third letter in the alphabetical sequence ?; or , that the letter `P'  is not what we think it to be, standing in Greek for `R' in English (which uses the roman alphabet, which derived from the Greek a long time ago) ; and so on.  <br />2) The fonts or types used are difficult to differentiate and understand in what seems to be an inordinate jungle of confusing letters, grouped in the worst possible visible way. If this is modern Greek, think about ancient Greek, with all its diacritic accentuations !! <br />3) A great opportunity was missed by the author in not making the Greek language more pleasant to the reader.

The seventh son of a wealthy family, he could have opted instead to follow (rather lamely it must be said) a militar career as his brothers did, or to take hold of a bishopric in a rich countryside in northern Italy, supported by his family wealth and pedigree, being closely akin to the most important men of his time (he was nephew to Frederick II, privy to Saint Louis, king of France, and many others potestates of his epoch). But he decided instead to be a humble Dominican friar , sloughing of all the perquisites of wealth, to be totally devoted to settling down the most intricate points in the Catholic doctrine, to be equaled only by Saint Augustine in doctrinal preeminence, his rulings being adopted as authoritative enough to be perused by popes and religious scholars inside and outside the Church for the next centuries. His access to the 500 volume library of the University of Paris, where he silently studied for many years and where he got the nickname \\"the Dumb Ox\\", due both to his body constitution as to his enormous appetite for intelectually heavy cargoes, was instrumental to his reading of ALL that had to be read at the time, being his mastering of the Greek language a plus he had against Saint Augustine, who never got familiar enough with that language, and got always a second hand view of the texts written by the founders of philosophy.  <br /> <br />The importance Plato had for Saint Augustine, Aristotle had for Thomas Aquinas, who respectfully called him \\"The Philosophus\\" (sic) or the \\"Commentator\\" (sic). The Summa Theologica is an attempt by Aquinas to solve the most troublesome points in doctrine, a monumental task tried before by many, who attempted to conciliate the Greek Church cannons to the Roman Church rulings, to the then powerfulphilosophical Arabic influence, being the Arabic philosophers the first who rescued Aristotle from the ashes of Augustianism, to the efforts of Albertus Magnus - who was Aquinas' master and  first tried to evolve science from Alchemy, etcetera.   <br /> <br />Using primarily an Aristotelian toolbox and terminology, but always faithfull to the Holy Scripture - and thus entangled in a rather wry explanation of the existence of things trough creationism - being the Bible authoritative enough to him as the own word of God, Aquinas establishes a rather apt hierarchical order in the world between all being (ens) and creatures (creaturae), some of them only possesed of material substance, some immaterial (angelus), and some with intermediate properties, being both material and immaterial (man).

US	36402156	R168J3ZW314F07	0870610635	418679639	The Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas (Five Volumes)	Books	5	45	50	N	N	Uni  versus, god as the ultimate end of all creation	The Summa Theologica is the masterwork of an indefatigable outstanding man who, having what is reputed to be the most prodigious mind of his time, pursued the mind of God (mens Dei) as his philosophical goal. He could have opted instead to follow (rather lamely it must be said) a militar career as his brothers did, or a bishopric in a rich country in northern Italy near the state of his rich father, supported by his family wealth and background, being akin to the most important men of his time (he was nephew to Frederick II, privy to Saint Louis, king of France, and many others potentates of his epoch). But he decided to be simply a humble Dominican friar , sloughing of all the perquisites of wealth, to be totally devoted to settling down the most intricate points in the Catholic doctrine, to be equaled only by Saint Augustine in doctrinal preeminence, his rulings being adopted as authoritative enough to be perused by popes and religious scholars inside and outside of the church for the next centuries. His access to the library of the University of Paris, where he studied for many years and where he got the nickname the Dumb Ox, that was to be his personal trademark for eternity, was instrumental to his reading of ALL that had to be read at the time, being his mastering of Greek a plus he had against Saint Augustine, who never got familiar enough with that language.     The importance Plato had for Saint Augustine, Aristotle had for Thomas Aquinas, who respectfully called him The Philosopher (sic). The Summa Theologica is an attempt by Aquinas to solve the most troublesome points in doctrine, a monumental task tried before by many who attempted to conciliate the Greek Church and Roman Church rulings (cannons), the then powerful philosophical Arabic influence, being the Arabic philosophers the first who rescued Aristotle from the ashes of Augustianism, the efforts of Albert Magnus - who was praeceptor of Aquinas - to evolve science from Alchemy etcetera. It is interesting to note here that the name science(from scio in Latin) , as happens with many others names used in the book , had a very different meaning then , as compared with the meaning it had since the beginning of the development of modern sciences.     Using primarily an Aristotelian toolbox and terminology, but always faithfull to the Holy Scripture - and thus entangled in a rather sly explanation of Creationism - being the Bible authoritative enough to him as the own word of God, Aquinas establishes a rather apt hierarchical order in the world between all being (ens) and creatures (criaturae), some of them only possesed of material substance, some immaterial (angelus), and some with intermediate properties, being both material and immaterial (humans). To him, the soulless (sine animae) material being was always oriented to the soulful material being and then  to the immaterial as its superior, e.g., stone to plants, plants to irrational animals and the latter to the rational ones, that is, to human beings, who by means of his intelect could reach na understanding of God trough His output (effects), that is, the created world.   Being both material and immaterial, homo naturaliter orientatur ist ad superiorem in the hierarchical order (ordo) that is, the angels, who were the supreme creatures of God. But what is God? Sorry, but there is no answer to this question: according to Aquinas, we only know that He is (quid est) trough His works, but will never know what He is (qui est), being the final contemplation of God the Supreme Good (sumum bonum) and the final goal of man. His explanation of good (bonum) as created by God and evil (malum) as a deprivation of good instead of its antipodal opposite, thus making man responsible for his acts via liber arbitrium, and quenching Manicheism - who affirmed that God created the immaterial beings and the Devil the material one - is magistral and is worthy the effort of reading a so difficult and voluminous book.   His explanation of God as an ens composed of three coeternal persons in just one substance and living out of time (per se subexistente, a tempori non mensuratur)  gives the reader sheer ecstasy in getting contact with one of the most prodigious philosophers of all times, no matter what the reader's creed. The sheer independence (but not indiference) of God as regarding human beings, because God loves himself preeminently (quia Dominus seipsum amat) is also notewhorthy.  To sum it up, what you have in your hand is the work of the most genial man of his time, who sent rippling waves of influence troughout the world as no other philosopher (or ox) did for many centuries to come.	2004-09-03

But I must confess in hindsight that the authorship was necessarily second in importance to the subject himself, The Dumb Ox, also known as Doctor Angelicus, who, along with Saint Augustine, were the most prolific and untiresome champions of the Catholic doctrine.  <br /> <br />After engaging myself in the difficult reading of  Thomas Aquinas masterwork Summa Theologica, an opus some 3.000 + pages long, written in Middle Age Latin, the book from Chesterton serviced me as a respite from the intricacies of Aquinas uneventful vocabulary and Aristotelian terminology, with never ending  contras, praeterea, seds, respondeos, et cetera , when approaching some difficult points in doctrine.  <br /> <br />It is an agreeable but necessary contradiction that a so gigantic man like Aquinas is portrayed trough a so small and unpretentious booklet, although it could be also said that notwithstanding the size of any Aquinas' biography, such a towering subject would always remain as elusive as ever, winning over any attempt to reduce him to human proportions or contours. But what the reader has in the end is a thorough view of Aquinas in what is now known as the most important biography of the Doctor Angelicus.   <br />	2004-09-02

Fedon is one of the most important dialogues from Plato and the prime goal of the interplay is to explain Platos views upon the important subject of the immortality of the human soul. The place where the dialogue happens is the cell where Socrates lived after being condemnened to death by a jury, and is carefully chosen to provide the ambience of rival philosophical thought, i.e., the northeast region of the Peloponesus, a region traditionally attached to the Pythagorean doctrine, as Fedon himself and Cedras, his companion in the last hours of Socrates life. <BR>In the dialogue, Fedon later reports to many important listeners what he himself heard from the greatest of all philosophers, Socrates, about the immortality of the soul and what one could expect when crossing the threshold of life and death. Socrates was to die in that very day and was gulping down the venom that was prescribed for him. While dying, he calmly kept talking to his friends about what would he expect in the next life. His mood was not somber at all ; he was in fact eagerly waiting to meet at the other side of death, the spirits and souls of already deceased friends, and more still to share the company of the gods who were his guardians in his earthly life. The concept of anamnesis, remembrance of things past illustrates the whole of the theory of Socrates that was inherited somehow by Plato, and is one of the highest points of the text. <BR>I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	2004-06-07

Also, besides being essentially Russian and universal at the same time, it is  auto-biographical at its core, where the protagonist Raskolnikov is easily identified with the man Dostoievsky not only for the Oedipus complex open ajar to the reader discretion.<br /> In my opinion, this is one of the 10 best prose books of the Occidental Classical Literature ever written and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	2004-05-23

Saint Augustine of Hippo was born in 354 A.D. in the city of Thagaste, in the Roman North African province of Numidia, near nowadays Algiers. He died in 430, witnessing both the Fall of the glorious Roman Empire to the invasion of the Vandals in North África, and the immediate following of his ideas by maverick African Catholicism, ideas for which he fought all his life in the most passionate way. He was a giant in its own right, being the prodigal son of the feverishly Catholic Saint Monica and of Patricius, a nondescript and abusing father who was to be thrown out by Augustine to the corners in his many works, the same fate destined to his prematurely dead son Adeodatus (Latin for \\"Given to God\\"), his elder brother and his concubine, the woman he lived with for many years, according with the local tradition of the times, and whom he sloughed of in the most unabashed way. It is only in the Confessions that he seems to scourge himself on this issue, wryly acknowledging the evil done. <br />He was one of the most prolific writers of all times, and the mature man who wrote Confessions in his mid-life is a sharp counterpoint to the points-of-views adopted by him in his early life, when he avidly followed Manichaeism against the will of his devoted mother. He had traveled intensively trough the foremost cities of the Roman Empire and had many patronizing influent men, and ended up, one thinks, against his will, as priest and later bishop of the city of Hippo, near Thagaste, where he had the responsibility of counterbalance the powerfull influence the Donatist (after Donatus) sect exerted upon his flock, who argued that human perfection was possible and attainable in this very life and the chaff elements of the Church having to be erased in the most cruel and quick ways by bands of brigands that descended from the mountains to attack whomever opposed their doctrine. But, that was not the last time he had to combat ideas different from his, and we see Augustine again holding the sword with fierceness against resurgent Paganism and in his final days, against Pelagianism and Julian Eclanus. It is strange that such a combative man died a natural dead, escaping the atrocities inflicted by the Vandals of Genseric upon his many friends and followers.<br />In Augustine´s view, to earn the eternal salvation, one had to confess all his past sins in the most unabashed and vocal way, and that is precisely the purpose of Confessions, to lay down all his many past sins, in order to be among the few who would be chosen by God Almight to enter upon the Eternal Kingdom. The book, originally written in Latin by a man who had little familiarity with the infuential Greek language, introduces a new style into the Literature of the time and is judged as one of the most influential autobiographies ever written . Along with his magnificent City of God, it erected the scaffolds of early Catholicism, and must be listed among one of the 100 most literary works of all times.	2004-05-23

For my part, I dont quite agree at all with this assertion, having already read many dense, enjoyable and full of meaning biographies. When crisscrossing biographies as \\"low-grade\\" literary accomplishments, critics should remember that one of the two most relevant textbooks from Augustine is his celebrate Confessions, written probably c.397 and listed among the most momentuous texts ever done. Should we follow the expert´s advice and scrape it into the trash bin of unimportant works? I don´t think so.<br />Getting back from this digression, I am not at all ashamed to affirm that \\"Augustine of Hippo - a biography\\", by Peter Brown, is a pretty elegant account of the life and work of one of the two most important philosophers of Catholicism of all times, the other being St.Thomas Aquinas, the writer of Summa Theological. \\"Augustine of Hippo\\" first published in 1967 was recently revised and republished , in 2000, with a new and fascinating epilogue, accouting for the whole new breed of  archealogical evidence that cropped up in between the two dates.<br />The book is not just a factual and competent account of the life of the man Augustine, being also a ponderous sketch of his unsurpassed work and contribution to the erection of the scaffolds and edifice of the Catholic Church, in a time of the decline fortune of paganism and of the Roman Empire itself. \\"Austine of Hippo\\" is a dense text, some 500 pages long, and dulcissimus to read, all the subjects and issues related to his life and work, being presented on good schematical order, supported by clear-cut tables and maps. The issues are well-chosen and give a full scope of the somewhat tumultuos life of the philsopher saint, son of Saint Monica, a towering figure over his son, much more so than his father Patriciusand his prematurely dead son Adeodatus. Many potentially mind boggling issues like Manichaeism, Neo-Platonism and the Trinity Dogma are written with simplicity, withouth the loss of inner coherence. <br />As a minor defect, I don´t quite agree with the extensive use of page footnotes, which makes the reading of the text somehow tedious.But, despite this irrelevant fault, I can think of no better way of addressing such unsurpassable subject as Saint Augustine and his contribution to world affairs.	2004-05-18

The likes of George W.Bush and his father, sarcastically named George Bush I and George Bush II by the author, as to denote a political autocracy in the States, are accompanied by Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, just to name a few American presidents of the XX century, all, in the authors radical view, banded together on a common ground of arrogance of and defiance to international established law (World Court, the United Nations, etc..), in order to secure to the United States and the goals established by the elite, the access to the strategic world resources demanded by the American collosus, oil primarily. The recent war in Iraq is in this way analysed as less recent wars in Middle East, Latin America and Africa, all of them occasioned and motivated by the power greed of the American government. It seems that from the radical perspective taken by the author, it makes no difference to world balance whether power is exerted by a Republican or Democrat, all of them adopting a political posture most convenient to American strategic interests. Traditional political allies of the USA like Britain, Israel and Turkey are portrayed on a very debasing light, given the knee-jerk posture they adopt vis-'a-vis the Americans.  <BR>   <BR>  Still following the authors view, the only power strong enough to counterpoise the ravages perpetrated in the world by American arrogance, is world public opinion, specially outside the USA, given the exposure of the latter to what Noah Chomsky calls the &quot;manufacturing of consent&quot;, attained via rigid media internal control. The book is a sharp rebuke to the posture adopted by sucessive generations of American political leaders, but unfortunately does not address ways or presents realistic proposals to get America and the world out of the mess we are all in, being, in any way, a good reading to anyone interested in the making of of international power politics of the supreme power and world politics of the second half of the XX century.

According to legend, it was due to the reading of a French version of the book from the Chinese philosopher turned general Sun Tzu that the great Napoleon had all the credits of his many victories. Whenever he did not apply the books precepts, also according to legend, he lost his bet and paid in human lives and shame. An English version was only available in the beginning of the 20 century, now digested, commented and explained by the James Clavel, author of the famous book Shogun and Gaijiin, just to name a few of his works.<br /> It is also said of this wonderfull small book that very few texts like it had so overwhelming a power to change things on human affairs, be them wars or business battles for competitive turf. But the conciseness of the text is fully intentional, alluding to the objectiveness Sun Tzu demanded from orders given by commanders to troops. A word less or a word more, and victory is in jeopardy and many lives were to be lost. In my opinion, the most important chapter of the book is the one covering the importance of the use of spies, something that is prevalent in world politics and in the business world. I liked also when he somehow alludes to a certain solitariness in victory, something akin to managerial solitude.<br /> This is certainly one of the best books ever to be written on the subject and I hope you enjoy it.	2004-04-23

Saint Augustine, for instance, one of the doctors of Christianity, is pillored as a forerunner of the Holy Inquisition in Spain and all his positive personal traits are read upside down by Paul Johnson, who sees everything in him with a tainted sight, portraying Augustine as a devilish person with no morals whatsoever.       <BR>A file of martyrs and saints is defiled due to this distorted vision and the reader is almost convinced that nothing is left out of the catholic church tradition which deserves praise, being the catholic institution just the natural heiress of an opressive and bureaucratic (Roman) empire only intent on controlling human beings and their properties for the sake of attaining material wealth and indiscriminate power. But all the prejudiced efforts of the author crumble  to the ground when one has the feeling  that the bias with which he treats all religious matters is only the sheer inheritance of someone with a puritanical view intent on demolishing the liturgy of the catholic church, thus sacrificing the ceremonial aspects inheritedby modernity and leaving nothing on its place. The absence of a complete bio of the author is conspicuous (who is him?, what is his personal creed?, in what he believes in?) and demonstrates that the authors goal is the sheer destruction of the catholic building, leaving nothing in its place.	2004-04-23

Faust, his   masterwork, portrays the inner struggle of a man who had everything on earth but who was profoundly disillusioned by the rigid limits imposed upon human life and creation, that in the search for the infinite of possibilities, sold his soul to the devil in order to grab with both hands whatever might come from the struggle between Good and Evil. Much of that human fight and quest is anticipated in the &quot;Sorrows of the Young Werther&quot;, one of Goethe´s first works and his very first romance, and a truly good one. Here the theme of the quest for the infinite and meanings in life is ever present and is beneath all the impossible interplay of Werther (Goethe himself), Lotte ( a feminine Lot, always looking backwards to face doom?) and her nondescript husband Albert.    <br />As in Faust, the protagonist (Werther) had it all with books, and the only one he carries and reads is Homer, where, in his own words, no limits were yet established for human growth and expansion. As in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, his is an impossible love, a human triangle that had to be bisected by a voluntary and violent farewell to his beloved Lotte - and to his life, something he finally accomplishes with the full knowledge of his beloved friend. The romance has a magnetic force upon the reader, who follows attentively the protagonist trough his epistolar via crucis with his friend Wilheim, untill the dramatic end.  In my opinion, the romance is directly antipodal to Flaubert´s Madame Bovary and as good as Madame Bovary, the latter being an ode of form against substance, the primacy of form against substance, while Goethe´s romance is sheer substance (love, hate, etc...) at its height, and, along with Madame Bovary, must be reckoned on the list of the 100 best romances ever written.

The first three books, elegantly featured on a velvet green cover and boxed together in picturally attractive white cardbox, cover the decline and fall of the so-called Western Empire, seated alternately in Rome or Verona in Italy in the end of the V century A.D., and I read it with respect and awe in no more than a month (see the pertinent review). The sequel, again presented with all the elegance the opus deserves, is composed of three voluminous books, totalling again some 2.000 pages and covering the period after the fall of Rome to the barbarians of the Visigoth Allaric and others, where the power and the Empire has moved its see to Constantinople (Byzantium) in the East. The Crusades and the likeness of the prophet Mohamed are there, although from the preconcept and biased view of a retrograde XVIII English colonizer who likened the Arabs to savages and women to a second class position in society. <BR>  This second series of book is as good and lenghty as the first series, something which is in itself an almost unattainable goal to any sequel such as this, and Gibbon has  once again the readers attention suspended on a perpetual state of anxiety, always looking forward to read in the next sequence of words a point of view or a descriptive text magistrally written about human boldness and courage in the event of victory, or else the picture of the frailties of human soul when facing impending danger. His polemical portrait of  Empress Theodora (according to him a former prostitute) is unequaled  to anything written before or after him, specially the part where it was to her that the fleeing emperor Athanasius owe the maintenance of his wavering will and his imperial rule.        <BR>  The erudition of EdwardGibbon is unparalelled and he unassumedly cites many ancient writters in Greek, Latin, French and other languages, letting solely to the reader the not so easy task of translating it into English. His English is elegant and unexpected and the avail of a handy good English dictionary of archaic words will be a helpfull tool to the reader. His sources are profuse and diversified and whenever he has the opportunity, he traces the parallel of ancient history with contemporary and imperial England in the making.<BR>  In my opinion, the misconcepts of some of his views notwithstanding, this is one of the most important works concerning the fall of Rome ever done and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	2004-04-06

May be this is ascribable to the relatively recent (less than 200 years) deciphering of the intricate Egyptian hieroglyphic script by the French mathematician Jean-François Champollion, a feat which expanded in more than 3.000 years the horizon of humankind, or maybe this is a kind of perverse and doctrinarian boomerang effect of old English colonies against its colonizers, demonstrating that whatever be the powerfull cultures - and armies - behing the colonizing Western powers, they would never attain the magic and the glory Egypt did at its apogee. The names of Cleopatra, Tutankhamen, Ramses, Champollion and many others somehow associated with Egypt culture and its glorious history are almost household names to many of us, demonstrating the intimacy Western and even Eastern (mostly specially Japanese, keen not to accept the supremacy of Chinese over them) readers have vis-'a-vis Egiptology. Sure, beneath all this there is a kind of \\"who first?\\" contest between the peoples, and most especially some governments, vying for the primacy of scientifically establishing who was the first craddle of civilization in the planet. See, in this regard, the recent efforts of the Chinese and even the Israeli government to find the earliest traces of civilization in their territories, thus displacing the Mesopothamia as the incumbent craddle of civilization.   <br />\\"Akhenaten and the religion of Light\\", written in the 1990´s by the German scholar and Egyptologist Eric Hornung, and magnificently translated into English, is a very small booklet about the cultural revolution brought about by the pharaoh Akhenaten (son of Amenophis III) , who during his 30 + years reign changed many of the religious creeds and cult practices of the time, being referred to by many as the first true monotheistic ruler of the world. To some scholars, he was the first individual of the Planet Earth, in the sense that he made a giant step in the dark in order to advance human understanding about oneself. If this was exactly not so, given that many others scholars point out that Egypt was first and foremost monotheist in its origin before adhering to polytheism, at least the pharaoh Akhenaten was the bold founder of a new religious and cultural movement which sent rippling waves trough years to come, given the huge impact his reforms had in almost every aspects of the daily life of his time. In his view, the only and sole God was the god Aten, represented by the sun rays, being in its essence Light, the creator of all existent creatures of the world.  The religious revolution set by Akhenaten (who was called Amenophis IV when ascended to the throne but changed his regal name to Akhenaten, thus dismissing the importance of the heretofore powerfull god Amen) had even a big impact in the concepts of the Egyptian Afterlife, almost debunking Osiris as the god of the heretofore important Egyptian netherworld.<br />Despite all the hoopla that surrounds the very attractive theme of monotheism, being even used by Sigmund Freud in his invenctives against Judaism and Christianism in his book Moses and Monotheism, the life and the death of the pharaoh Akhenaten is shrouded in mistery and secrecy and not too many details of his life and of his royal family are produced out of the excavations made in the territory in Middle Egypt that he designated to be his future home and temple to the God Aten, where he settled with his family and famous first wife Nefertite and harem, living a reclusive life dedicated foremost to religious affairs, almost foregoing important aspects of Egyptian external affairs with its neighbours. In fact, his relics are virtually non-existent and many of the information gathered are collected from burial grounds of his followers in the Egyptian bureaucracy.<br />Despite the conciseness of thetext, this is a very invigorating approach to the life of this important pharaoh, who by many was compared with the likes of Saint Paul, Saint Francis and even Albert Einstein, this latter due to the importance both men put in light as an inspirational power to the creation of life on Earth.

In this regard, the Frenchman mathematician Jean-François Champollion, the decipherer of the Egyptian hieroglyphs in the Rosetta Stone (the name Rosetta derives from the place Rashid in the North of Africa), the most well known block of stone in the world. Alongside with him is the British amateur archeologist and linguist Michael Ventris, who in 1953 broke the code of the so-called Minoan Linear B tablets.  COntrary with what happened in the case of the Rosetta Stone, where alongside with the text to be deciphered (in demotic Egyptian and in hieroglyphics), there was not a base text (in Greek) to be confuted with. It is so not surprising that the great majority of decipherers attained its goas before reaching 30 years of age.<br /> The feats of these two men, who depended upon the previous work of many others who trod the same paths before them, is detailed narrated in this very good book, richly illustrated with many ellucidative diagrams, graphs, drawings and pictures of alphabets, sillabarys and hieroglyphs, Egyptian inclusive. Andrew Robinson, the author of this excelent book, is in this regard extremely well equiped to present difficult subjects in a very easy manner to the lay reader like myself, who is only looking for the big picture and do not care about the multitude of details present in this type of work. The chapter on the deciphering of the Maya script by a Russian scholar is also a very informative one, in fact overflowing the reader with a lot of pertinent graphic information.      <br /> The scripts still waiting to be broken (Linear A among others and the scripts of the Easter isle) are very fascinating chapters of the book and one almost feels the urge to quit everything immediately and jump right away into the arena of deciphering dead languages. <BR>In my opinion, this book is as good as it could be on the important subject of the decoding of the dead languages of humanity.    <br /> This edition of the book is indeed a very rich one and this is the kind of book one feels pretty much comfortable to give as a gift to friends and relatives. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. <BR>________________________________________________________________________	2004-03-15

Many were the obstacles imposed on the many scholars who ventured to crack down the code, to no avail to the great majority of them. The most conspicuos hindrance was the fact that, contrary to what happened in the case of the deciphering of the Egyptian hieroglyphs by the French mathematician Jean-François Champollion, there was not a handy Rosetta Stone with bilinguals, that is, with texts  to be confuted both in the language to be decoded as in an already known language (Greek, in the case of the Rosetta Stone). To add to the difficulty, the discoverer of the first tablets, Mr.Arthru Evans, was not the team-work type of man, preferring to work alone and hiding from the others scholars almost all the pertinent tablets. <br />So, the deciphering of the so-called Minoan Linear B scripts was a task compared in its difficulty to the first escalation of Mount Everest and to the discovery of the structure of DNAs, all of them happened in the very same year the professional architect and amateur scholar Michael Ventris announced having first cracked the Minoan code, in 1953. The fundamental enigma was what was the language beneath the Linear B sillabary (different from an alphabet, a sillabary represents pictorally sometimes in just one design syllab sounds, e.g, me, fe, ra, etc.). To everyone´s amazement , and even to Michael Ventris himself, who had for a long time contended that the hidden language was Etruscan, a Greek ancient dialect was there all the time, masquaraded by a somewhat similar Cypriot sillabary. <br />The book has all the ingredients of a best-seller and it is a case in point for the preponderance of group work as against the work of mavericks as Arthur Evans. It is also a proof that Natura non facit saltum and that the Eureka cry not always comes from the ones who are in the front line of research, coming instead from people at the second rank as was the case of Ventris, an architec by formation and practice, who now and then made a dive in that type of reserch. His mixture of intuition and knowledge of the many areas involved proved to be the right one to the cracking of the code. Also, the premature death of Michael Ventris at the age of 34 is a mysterious event that to some people repeats the death by suicide of his depressive Polish and beloved mother ; one has also to remember that the Greek alphabet used today was only used since circa 800 BC, surrounded by the many uncertainties regarding the oral background of Homer works like the Odissey and the Illiad. Was the discovery of such material in Crete and afterwards in mainland Greece to expand the range of research of Greek antiquity?<br />This is a very good book to anyone interested in the peculiarities of genial men like Michael Ventris and in the origin of languages.	2004-03-15

The Hour of Decision was written by the German thinker Oswald Spengler and first published in 1933, the year National Socialism took over power in German. The book is a fizzled and sad sequel, despite foreseeable, to Oswald Spengler's major opus, The Decline of the West, first published in 1918 and one has the feeling that he seemed to grab with both hands the historical window of opportunity to jump into (mainly) Mussolini's autocratic bandwagon, frequently quoting the italian dictator as incorporating many of the qualities of a would-be imperial autocrat, in the shadows of Julius Cesar, Napoleon and a few others, thus fulfilling the natural whole autocrats should have in the History of the West, as per the Decline of the West.<br />In my opinion, Oswald Spengler's The Hour of Decision is a racist pamphlet against Jews and all minorities, and deserves all the censure for its backward racist points-of-view.<br />________________________________________________________________________	2004-03-15

The barbarians hordes were already knocking at the gates of Rome and many other important cities and eventually got there invadind Rome  trough the auspices of the Germanic barbarian Alaric, who, along with Atila the Hun, was one of the cruelest of his kind. The \\"Civitatis Dei\\" was written a few years after the first sack of Rome, a thrilling background to and the starting point of many of Saint Augustine ideas concerning God's attitude toward the city and its citizens. Despite the impending fall of the Western Empire, Christianism was steadily gaining ground as the official religion vis-à-vis Paganinsm, which began to suffer all the burden of (unofficial) persecuted by some Roman emperors. But Paganinsm still had strong adherents in many important places, specially in the Senate,  and the purpose of Saint Augustine was to counterpoise the ascending fortunes of Christianity.            <br /> Augustine, born in the north of Africa in the city of Hippo, was one of the most important theoreticians of Christian doctrine of all times, a great thinker in his own right, who could be compared to great Catholic thinkers as Saint Thomas Aquina and Saint Paul, being one of the true founding fathers of the Catholic tradition and religion along with the Gospel four Evangelists. His written output is impressive, even outstanding, both from the point of view of its quantity as from the point of view of its inner quality. His most important works, written in Latin as usual at the time, are \\"The City of God\\" (Civitatis Dei) and \\"Confessions\\", the former an impressive bookof 1,100+ pages of teachings concerning various aspects of the lives of Christians and pagans in the V century he lived. <br /> The book's lenght notwithstanding, it is a very pleasant and easy reading, not losing the elegance it should have in Latin, with all the quotations necessary for the full understanding concerning some allusion of Augustine to the recent or remote history of Rome, ROman and Greek mythology and philosophical citations from authors renowned at the time but almost unknown today. A good introduction to the life and work of Saint Augustine is also provided.<br /> TO sum it up, the book is a very good one and an essential reading to anyone interested in the importance of the philosophical thinking before the Middle Ages, most certainly influenced by Plato instead of Aristotle. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	2004-02-13

Terrific!!	\\"Faust\\" is the masterwork of Goethe, the most important German poet and writer of all times, a giant in his own right, to<BR> be compared with the likes of William Shakespeare, Dante Aligheri, Miguel de Cervantes and the Portuguese Luis de Camões. To some, he is the most bright and intelligent of all 80 billion Homo Sapiens Sapiens creatures who live or ever lived in this world of ours since the genetic split from the first Eve and the first Adam some 130.000 years ago in North Africa (see in this regard, the works of the Italian geneticist Luigi Sforza). Goethe´s IQ is  in the range of a breath-taking 205, some 30 points ahead of \\"lesser\\" genius like Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton or Karl Marx. Despite not being a philosopher in the strict sense of the word, his many folded ideas were bold enough to place him in the companionship of the greatest philosophers of all times, like Plato, Socrates or Aristotle. In fact, many lesser philosophers took the bait of his thinking, gulped it down and digested it to form a brand new full-fledged philosophical thinking. (See in this regard, for instance, the work of the German Oswald Spengler, specially \\"The Decline of the West\\"). Goethe was a giant who surpassed all established standards. His work influenced Western thought in many fields.<br /> \\"Faust\\", written in two parts, is a theatrical play about the eternal fight between Good and Evil and about a man (dr.Faust) who sold his soul to the devil (Mephistopheles). Faust was the prototype of a bright and most successfull man of his time, being a professional doctor and a man of polymath genius (like Goethe himself), but deeply bored by a routine life, only broken by the plenty of access he had to the western literature of the time. He seems to be drowned in a sea of books, but that was not enough to make him happy with himself. But Dr.Faust wanted more and, at last, he gave his soul to the devil in exchange for a life full of immediate, long-lasting and unexampled sensuous pleasures. Wasn´t he in this respect a bit like you and me? <br /> What it is at stake is the supremacy of Evil or Good upon its contrary, an object of all philosophers and religions and the German poet does not take it lightly: he calls the powers and the names of Greek and Roman mythology, along with all the hierarchy of the Catholic tradition, specially the Virgin Mary and a constellation of angels, to help dr.Faust in his battle against the dark forces of evil. Who is to succeed? Evil or Good? Also, the battle can be seen as occurring inside Dr.Faust´s mind and body, which opened plenty of room to the argument that what was at stake was in reality the struggle between the Rational and the Irrational (or Unconscious) side of ourselves, an argument taken by, among others, Carl Jung and his followers.                          <br /> To sum it up, what you have in your hands is one of the most interesting and thrilling stories of our civilization, narrated by a man well ahead of his time and space, a book that can change one´s life if read with the appropriate attention and in the adequate circumstance.   I am sure you will not be disappointed, and after having read it , you will get back to the book many times to get another glimpse of such and such situation or to fix some point. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	2004-02-11

The importance of the debate is big, nothing less than the influence this type of cult had on the formation of the Jewish religion (Jews were held captives in Egypt at Akenaton´s time) and later on Christianism and Catholicism.   <br />&quot;The Conceptions of God in Ancient Egypt - The One and the Many&quot; was written in German in the 1970´s and translated into English in the 80´s. Dates are of the utmost importance here due to the archeological material available to the researcher, which has in his hands much more pertinent information than a writer 50 years ago. Both writer and translator are eminent figures of modern Egyptology who has in German and in France many of its most important researchers. The task they face is gigantic, nothing less than trying to interpret the meaning of abstract religious concepts, the concept of God being the foremost.  <br /> Religion is one of the most important aspects of a Culture, if not the most important aspect, and has to be interpreted by its own sticks and standards and not by the stick and measures of any other Culture, and this is the essential point which shows the true hardship of managing this subject and then avoiding the acceptance of standars of Western theology. Thus, many questions appear which ask for the most excruciating analisys from the part of the author : what was the meaning of God for the Ancient Egyptian? Is the word God equivalent to the (consonantal) word for god in the language of old Egypt, ntr? Was Egypt first polytheist and later monotheist or the other way around? What is the rule syncretism played in the religion? Was there a people´s religion parallel to a cultured religiosity? How the representation of Godevolved in time from fetishism (the representation of gods trough not animated things, an staff for instance) to representation of gods trough animals (hawks, ibises, crocodiles etc) and, in the later stages, trough human forms or anthropomorphism and even in a triad of mixed forms (staff, hawk and human)?<br /> &quot;The Conceptions of God in Ancient Egypt&quot; is a challenging book but it is not an introductory book targeted for the lay reader, who must be familiar with a difficult vocabulary; wadi, ostraca, papyri, nome, ennead are some of the words in English that crop up in the text and are not conveniently explained by Erik Honnung neither easily found in a good English lexicon. Also a good old Egyptian glossary is missing, thus making the understanding of the texts a real nightmare to the common reader. Finally, also is lacking a good map of ancient North Africa to better locate the cities and geographical accidents cited in the book. As a good add-on, there is a good cronological map of the dynasties of Egypt and a much interesting glossary of the names of the many gods quoted in the book with some paralel with their Greek counterparts. <br /> To sum it up, the book is a pretty good one but could not be taken as an easy read for any one not familiar with things of old Egypt.	2004-02-02

The treatment of other families of languages, like Altaic and Uralic is quite adequate and there the reader has an almost graphic depction of the origins of modern languages like Finnish, Turkish and Corean, for example. The Semitic family of languages, from where comes Hebrew and the Arabic languages is also treated there but, in my opinion,  in a way very insufficient way. Much attention is given instead to the languages of Oceania (Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and Australia) where the great majority of the languages of today are spoken.<BR>Also of importance are the charts that portray in a very easy manner the relationship of all the most important families of languages to the primitive family of unwritten languages spoken some 8.000 years ago!!!

It is a good book indeed and the maniacs are its principal characters, its protagonists as we learn when we read it (you will learn about the debate that raged for decades  on the plural of this very special word protagonist). The Madman of the title is the American war surgeon W.C.Minor, the most secretive and prolific word voluntary individual contributor to the work of Mr.James Murray, the Professor of the title and a linguist who worked almost a quarter of a century in the design and in the making of one of the most important human literary achievements of all times, The Oxford English Dictionary, a project so complex that it took seven decades to be fully completed and to be known to posterity as a watershed event in the field of English literature. The numbers involved are astounding and there is also a good book by Simon Winchester, called The Making of the Oxford English Dictionary, with every relevant aspect involved in its completion.   <br /> The Professor was an extremely humble man of very poor rural extraction, fundamentally religious in all aspects of his family life, deeply attached to the women he married (his first wife died soon after marrying him) and to his children, and a real giant in the field of linguistics, already polylinguist when a 15 year old boy, asking cows and oxen questions in Latin, knowing more than 25 different languages in his adult life and always eager to learn more and more, and to become famous trough his masterwork; he was a real polymath, a man of many different aptitudes in Mineralogy, Botanic and Geology, just to name a few, with an impressive personal network of acquaintances throughout the Victorian world he lived in, including the father of the notorious American inventor Graham Bell.His participation in the making of the most important dictionary of the English language was an watershed event both for him as to the dictionary itself, and, in the end, all of them both made a lot of difference to solidify English as a world language. <br /> When the Professor finally got to know the person with whom he corresponded for more than two decades, withouth personally one knowing each other for a long period of time, W.C. Minor being an always elusive correspondent as possible, James Murray  ingeniously but naively anticipated he would meet an educated country nobleman with a cultured background, mild mannered and polite, an English gentleman in his own right. But the man he at last met was completely different from what he had anticipated and the venue of their their meeting was not a noble courtyard in the countryside as avidly expected, but a rather dark room in the most famous Asylum for worst case lunatics in rural England. <br />  Dr.W.C.Minor, born in Ceylon to an American congregationist preaching family and later educated in the prestigious Yale Faculty of Medicine, was a totally crazy man, arrested years before for having murdered a British man he didn´t know and mistook for a phantastic Irishman in a district near London, but acquited by the jury as inimputable due to his pretty bad mental condition; he was sentenced to end his final days in the most reclusive Asylum to the mentally deranged and the origin of his lunacy was never truly attested or certified but was most probably atributable to the hell years he voluntarily spent as a field surgeon in the American Civil War when, in this capacity, he was obliged, so goes the legend, to brand the letter D (for desertor) in the face of a Irishman he did not know, according to the terrible treatment dispensed to war desertors, specially of foreign extraction. This brutal episode had a lasting effect in his mind and from that moment on he began his descent into his personal hell, always paranoidabout the impending danger of Irishmen chasing him to revenge the pain he inflicted in their comrade countryman. But W.C. Minor had among his virtues a kind of monomania, a deep attachment to every thing he did and liked, and among his many fields of interest, languages was of the utmost importance to him, who, raised in a very challenging environment for an American boy, learned many exotic languages when a child.      <br /> The book is a very good interplay of many human frailties and noble intentions and a good one indeed. It has all the ingredients of a good novel and the author ingeniously keeps the reader attentive to the end by means of a very ingenous narrative, sprinkled with many details about the epoch, the necessity of such a dictionary and the rationale, if any there is, behind the behavior of Mr.Minor.	2004-01-27

By the fierce argumentation the author does in favor of the use of a Russian/English frequency dictionary - even asking for a kind of primacy in this regard - it could be imagined that we are in the threshold of something brand new and that what it is at stake is equivalent to the Inauguration of a New Age in the very important field of Lexicography, the Art of Designing and Making dictionaries, which would put the effort of Mr.Nicholas in the same level as the effort taken by world famous lexicographers as Mr.James Murray (Oxford English Dictionary), Mr.Noah (Webster), Monsieur Larousse and a few others diligent and oustanding men and women of letters. Mr.Nicholas argumentative stamina notwithstanding, and despite his undoubtfull proficiency in this very difficult subject matter, his views are not at all convincing and not at all free from the burden of proof of its real useability, and in the end what the reader has in his/her hands is a very weirdly listed dictionary or lexicon, absolutely no more useful than the traditional ones already available in the market, and most probably of less efficiency than the author thinks it has and the reader expects it to be. What is worse, it increases and stresses the need for a traditional type of lexicon.<BR> <BR> In my opinion, the balance between pros and cons  for such a type of lexicon is heavily tipped in favor of the Cons instead of the Pros:<br /> Cons:  <BR>  1- there is not enough explanation of the meaning of the Russian words listed, thus not eliminating the need or utility of a traditional lexicon. This kind of over simplification does not do any good to any one keen on learning a new language, and should not be the apanage of any dictionary. Why not more meaningfull explanations in each entry? Simplification is not a concept that should be introduced in the field of Lexicography which grows trough diversification.  <BR>  2- absence of the difficult Russian cyrilic alphabet listed in its alphabetical order with corresponding sounds of vowels and consonants in English; every traditional dictionary has one for just one reason: it works and it helps the reader´s life a lot. It would be a plus also here!. A good historiography of the Cyrilic would also be a handy tool, specially for the readers acquainted with its parent but narrower modern Greek alphabet. A short history of the Russian language and its Slavic and Indo-European origins would also be a bonus.<BR>  3- absence of a Russian Grammar  (even a unsophisticated one would do a lot of good!!) with a due explanation of the system of declensions, present too in a synthetic language like Russian.  <BR>  4- absence of list of conjugations of verbs (paradigms) in Russian, present in every good traditional lexicon. <BR>  5- lack of the important sinergy between each and every development in language and also between difficult or literary words and common ones, which means that the words beyond the 10.000 threshold do not leverage the knowledgeability of words within that limit, and vice-versa. We know by the history of the development of the languages that they evolve trough intimate contact, both external and internal. The formation of the English language is a major example of this, both from the point of view of borrowing and lending to and from Latin, French, German, Nordic languages, etc. Russian would be no exception, given the historic interchange between the slavs of early time and the Romans and, more recently, with French and German.  <BR>  6- in such a dynamic world of today things change very fast, and the first 10.000 words with more frequency of use of the last 50 years  will certainly not be the same in, say, 5 years. Add the communist bias present in many of the texts of the last45 years and it will compound the problem.    <BR>  7- Why 10.000 words? 3.000 would be enough. 3.000 words is the amount of words of a reasonably argumentative person. The statistics for the use of each additional 1.000 words in the frequency vocabulary, shows that the percentage points of significance fall abruptly from one bracket to another. In fact, the rationale behind such type of dictionary, if there is one, prevails more for less than for more words.  <BR>  8- The final product is a bit cumbersome, phisically much bigger and difficult to handle than a traditional Lexicon.  A 10.000 word traditional dictionary would weight much less with much more content and useability. <BR>  9 - Also a good add-on would be a walk trough the influence some Russian words had on our occidental culture recently,  \\"perestroika\\" and \\"glasnot\\" being the most conspicuos examples.

The Swiss Carl Jung and the Austrian Sigmund Freud are the annointed fathers of Psychanalisys, with due precedence to be ascribed to Freud, some 25 years Jung´s senior and who broke loose with early tradition who saw the manifestation of the unconscious as unmeaningful. Both were men of the XIX century but their achievements changed the face of earth in the XX century . The excelent book \\"Man and his Symbols\\" is in all respects emblematic of many important facets of Jung´s thoughts and ideas on the unconscious, being one of the last books he wrote and/or supervised before his death in old age, which ocurred many years after Freud´s passed away in 1939 in London. In fact, the deaths of the two most important figures in Psychanalisys are emblematic of their lives, Freud dying an agonizing death to throat cancer and asking for the final shot which would take him to the depths of eternity (whatever this may be in Freud´s mind) whilst Jung died naturally of old age and wholy mystical, almost religious. \\"Man and His Symbols\\" is quintessential Jung, with plenty of his vigor and energy, even if he did not write himself all the six essays of the book, but only a very important one concerning the fundamental role Dreams play in our life as a whole. It is in fact the only book by Carl Jung originally targeted to the non-professional reader and devoid of almost all psychanalytic jargon, thus making the reading of the book a pleasant experience to the non-professional reader like myself; all the five essaysts are bona fide Jung followers or adherents to his ideas. The idea of having a book targeted to the layman drew a lot of personal energy from Jung, always keen on having the right word for the right psychical situation (the same could be said of Freud). But, in the end, he gave in and agreed on the project´s idea which was to popularize Jung´s ideas throughout the world. <br /> The book is an important document of Jung´s thought in the final days of his long and prolific life and stresses the many differences in important points of view he had vis-'a-vis Sigmund Freud, who, in the beginning of their relationship in 1906, was almost a father figure to the younger Jung and to whom Jung was supposed to be the heir apparent in the field of Psychanalisys. But Jung and Freud splitted apart their relationship on very personnal matters, due to Freud´s lack of confidence in anyone but himself. The  acerbic and bitter feud between the two, is documented in the many letters they exchanged for almost a decade and, in my opinion, Freud is the only one to blame, being a man of extremely bad temper and all too skitishy, with an overpowering ego with no admission of any wrinkle in the front of his followers scouts . There is a pretty much good medium sized book who documents the increasingly acerbic correspondence between the two, called \\"The Freud-Jung Letters\\" and which is also a good read, even in the available abridged version. In the same vein, see the quasi autobiographic essay by Jung and Anne Jafet, \\"Memories, Dreams and Reflections\\", where Jung (hesitatingly) talks about having reached in his last days the equilibrium between conscious and unconscious life, something he said to be one of the most important achievements of his.          <br /> In Jung´s view, symbols are important archetypal manifestations of man´s powerfull unconscious and occur in each and every human society, primitive or advanced, and could not be simply dismissed or ruled out, as always civilized societies do, as only belonging to ancient backward peoples. According to Jung, symbols are archetypal manifestations of our innermost unconscious mental life and have an important role in balancing our waking life as long as we let them play unscathed and don´t see them as something that we must be scared of. But, exactly from where symbols come? How do they get formed? In Jung´s view, nobody will never know a precise answer for that question, which is to be placed inthe dominion of the perpetually Unkown, and all societies seem to think that they were formed many aeons ago in the time of their ancestors, an always wrong assumption when we know that even ancient Greeks and Egyptians thought this way. Symbols, as many other things, simply do Exist and Are and play an important function in helping men by balancing their acts and lives, having although a disruptive influence whenever not correctly interpreted and unduly repressed. As Jung remembers, Goethe said in Faust: In the beginning there was the ACT. Symbols may be a timeless representation of things to be done and not to be thought out. But what are they? Couldn´t they be messages from God? Different from Freud, a very irreligious man and who bashed even Jewish religion in his magistral books \\"Moses and Monotheism\\" and \\"Totem and Taboo\\", the open-minded and mystical Jung thinks that symbols can even be messages from an upper entity. Civilized men, betting all their chips in Reason as supreme, that is, in the primacy of a conscious (rational) attitude towards life, have increasingly attached an \\"off-limits\\" tag to the unconscious, thus spliting the psyche into two entities apart, not benefiting from the positive influence the unconscious may and should have on our being as a whole. <br /> The many black and white pictures and images profusely portrayed in the book help the reader a lot in understanding the jungian message about the significance of symbols and this paperback amazingly lightweight edition is agreeable to handle and flip and to carry along with one self. \\"Man and his Symbols\\" is a pretty much good book and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	2004-01-27

Wheelock´s Latin is simply the best available Latin Grammar written for the English student in the States and abroad. You will get all your money´s worth back in the form of a concise but precise history of the Latin language, from where it comes in the Indo-european family of languages, and its parenthood to the so-called Romance languages (as an add-on, you can learn some Italian, Spanish and French, too), its presence in modern English, and also four very interesting black and white maps of Roman expansion trough Europe, Africa and Asia Minor, additioned to the original book by Mr.Richard LaFleur, the editor of this 6th and pretty modern and elegant edition. Wheelock´s Latin is, in fact, a phenomenon and a landmark not only in terms of its sales numbers but also as a basis for the creation of a Latin true book market, given the huge quantity of books and books of exercices that were created or inspired and have developed since the book was first published, in order to fulfill the amazing demand created by it. <br />At Wheelock´s you learn Latin step by step, having as your teacher, an attentive master, who knows the best path to the learning of the language of Horace, Cicero and Virgil and others (sure, they and many others are all there, with texts progressively adapted according to the level of proficiency of the student). Latin sentences to be translated into English and the other way around abound, with all the necessary vocabulary listed before the exercises. If more is needed, the student is helped by a very good glossary at the end of the book, where all the words are listed in alphabetical order and according to Latin use of the nominative and genitive cases in the case of nouns and adjectives, and, in the case of verbs, with verbs listed in alphabetical order, in the Latin way, e.g., (amo, as, are, atum). Keys to the exercises are also presented in the end of the book, thus facilitating your doing of your Latin homework  workload.<br />The book begins with the conjugation of the verbs in the first regular conjugation and proceeds till the 4th regular conjugation and then the student is presented to the passive forms of the regular conjugations, the irregular ones, the semi-deponents and , finally, the deponents verbs, a very Latinian form of conjugation. Along the way, he/she is presented to the  important concept of declensions, used in the so-called synthetic languages (Greek, Russian, German, for instance) being gradually introduced to the &quot;conjugations&quot; of nouns, adjectives and numerals in Latin. All this, as I said, nice and easily, learning a lot of useful things along the way. <br />I could imagine of no better Latin grammar for the student of English nowadays and I hope you enjoy its reading and exercises as much as I did. Valete!!	2004-01-13

Maybe that was exactly the purpoted goal of the author, that is, to write the book as a factual and precise account of what happened in the XX century to generations to come, thus coronating a professional career of that most brilliant historian, but which, as a necessary counterpoise of his strategy, lessens the impact of its narrative to baby-boomers and Second World War survivors.<br /> The idea presented by Hobsbawn is that the XX century is a brief one, where one hundred equals 87, the exact number of years between 1914, when the century began, and 1991, where it ended. It had its formative moments in its first phase, called by him<BR>as the &quot;Age of Catastrophe&quot;, and which elapsed between 1914-1945, and was marked by two major global conflicts, that acted as a relay of powere to the Soviet Union and to the United States as the two contending global forces. Sure, a number of interesting facts considerations does appear, like the one where is stressed the almost paranoid preoccupation of Josef Stalin in preserving the Soviet Union as a solid state, bluffing almost all the times against foreign menace and at the same time eager not to have the United States accepting his threats as real ones. This bluff politics was latter to be magistrally also adopted by the show-man Nikita Kruschev, who &quot;shoed-down&quot; the United States in the United Nations General Assembly.<br />  The second period, called the Golden Age, and which spans 1946 trough 73, is the period where the capitalist system learned the lessons it had to learn from every part, inclusive from the communist practise of government controls, and reached the peak of its economic boom; that was also the period where the United States and the Soviet Union made the nuclear threat a major obstacle to anyone happines, especially in Europe, and where many proxy-wars were fought in the Third World. <br /> After this almost quarter of century of progress and expansion and paranoia, the impulse loses its momentum and the word, following Hobsbawn, immerses itself in gloom and lack of alternatives, due to the crumbling down of the Soviet Union into many nationalistic states, and where, also acording to him, the road ahead is not clear and necessary a good one for us survivors. <br /> If Mr.Hobsbawn, always a good reporter of the world he lived in, is right or not, the answer will be given by the children of your grand-grand-children. Make them a favor, buying the book, enclosing this message of mine, and answer, please to my grand-grand-children in the year 2.100. Me? I will be in heaven (I hope) watching out what is happening here in earth down below.	2004-01-13

Born in Athens circa 470 BC, in the time of its apogee, Socrates lived a poor life, not paying any tribute to the so-called frivolities and luxuries of life, thus irritating his many foes, which took monetary advantage of their philosophical practice. The great Socrates had Plato as his most dedicated disciple, among others, who set himself to write down all Socratic discourses, thus preserving to posterity the very special way of thinking Socrates had, known as &quot;maieuthics&quot;. Socrates did not leave to posterity any written document of his handwriting, and that is why that the dedication Plato had to him was important to us. It is something like the work of a match who kindles a very beautiful candle. <br /> Socrates was the son of a midwife and a sculptor and his very particular philosophical method was performed by means of very well-formulated questions, that showed that the answers to the questions asked were already there at the very first time, and only had to be delivered out of the inner self by means of philosophical questioning, something akin to the help a mid-wife does to a pregnant woman in her labours prior before the baby is born.<br /> In my opinion, the most important part of this small booklet is the Apology of Socrates, where the wisest of all men shows to the tribunal that the only superiority he had over his accusers was that he did not pretend to know anything at all, while his accusers boasted a knowledge they did not have. The ideals formulated or used by Socrates (&quot;Know thyself&quot;) were later adopted by the Christian religion and evidenced a man in a inner struggle with his internal &quot;daemon&quot;, a word which originally had quite another meaning than the modern one, and showed a man with a great coherence in life and, as Nietzche said, most important, a coherence in the face of death, cause to death he was sentenced by his accusers, who were, as predicted by Socrates, to be ruined after his death. <br /> Plato is the apparent heir of the socratic tradition and in this small opus pays his tributes to the master of his youth. <BR> I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did.	2004-01-07

Latin is known to all as a difficult language to learn, and difficult it is, specially due to its synthetic language character, contrary to the character analytic of the modern English language, which, coming from the Germanic family of languages, in its evolution stripped itself from many synthetic features, what adds difficulty to every student of Latin who speaks English as its mother tongue. Due also to the common Indo-european heritage both languages have, we could call Latin an Uncle of English, as if in a type of patrilineal relationship that happened in some primitive peoples. And this uncle-ish character is fully preserved in the exercise book &quot;38 Latin Stories&quot;, by Anne Groton and James May, and this is a pretty much good surprising characteristic of it.<br /> The book is designed for English speaking students who are using the famous and good &quot;Wheelok´s Latin&quot; as its Latin Grammar. I bought the two books together but jumped rigth away to &quot;38 Latin Stories&quot; and was not disappointed at all. I got in fact a lot of fun out of it and all the pleasure and satisfaction I was expecting, which means the authors did a good job.  Each of the 38 stories presented are famous texts of Latin or Greek ancient authors adapted to a modern reader, and the lessons are increasing in difficulty, according to the corresponding chapters of Wheelok´s. The texts are at the left side of the page, with some remarks on the level of difficulty presented and at the right side there is the corresponding and explained vocabulary. At the end of the book, there is a very good glossary with words that are also important to the understanding of the texts, all this according to strict Latin way of presentations of verbs, nouns and all types of words. <br /> The texts are somewhat small but very interesting, both from the point of view of the stories written, all of them taken and adapted to prose from very well-known Latin or even Greek writers (Cicero, Homer,Julius Cesar etcetera). Given the idiosyncracies of the extreme irregular conjugation of verbs in Latin, and this specially from the point of view of the English speaking reader, it is advisable to have as an add-on any of the many good book of Latin verbs, as, for instance, 501 Latin verbs, by Richard Prior &amp; Joseph Wohlberg, which has also a good verb locator.<br />  38 Stories is a very good help to any one interested in the Latin language, but it supposes some prior knowledge of the language. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Good reading and Valete!!	2004-01-02

Given internal religious strife in Europe, and England was in no exception mood, these were pretty much dangerous times and many heads rolled and were to roll, More&quot;s included, due to the persecution by Henry VIII. Whatever was to be said about the nettlesome religious matter had to be done with extrema caution in order to avoid the perilous verdicts of the Holy Tribunal. <br />Along with Thomas More, Desiderius Erasmus was one of the most important representatives of the Renaissance literary movement in northern Europe and what was casually presented by Erasmus as a booklet inspired by a casual play of words with the surname More (which is almost equal to Moriae, madness in Greek), was in fact an attempt to salvage what should be rescued of the Classical Greek Antiquity in Erasmus' opinionated argument and incorporated in the Christian thought of the time. Beneath an almost non-descript façade was an issue of utmost significance to the evolution of the so-called Natural Sciences, that were to benefit from advances of recent discoveries in Physics, Chemistry and later on Biology, but which were hindered to evolve by the so-called aristotelian taint   inherited by the Scholastic medieveal tradition so dear to the traditionalist Catholic Church, a task difficult in itself but which Erasmus easily outdone with a satyrical style that offended no one, preserving all the respect to the Church hierarchy and its dogmas and, most importantly, the figure of Jesus Christ.<br />The book is in fact a small one but the reader is much rewarded by the richness of its content, where the author takes him by his hands and strolls with him trough ancient Greek and Roman mithology in a verbose prose at the same time easy, vigorous and stimulating, where oneis impressed by the author's astounding erudiction, as if he was a northern true inheritor of the Tuscan Dante Aligheri (the Divine Comedy) in this purpose. This is certainly one of the best literary works of late Renaissance and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	2003-12-29

It is a small booklet, something to attest to the economy of  its design; in fact, what the author had in mind was to achieve the strongest impact in the mind of his master and owner of his life while using a minimum of words. And impact it had, not only on the prince's mind - thus lightning the Machiavelli's burden at his hands - but also all over the rest of the world since its publication. <br /> Machiavellian became an adjective of daily usage, almost always with strong negative overtones, and many of the crude advices listed at the book were  eventually adopted by many rulers in the whole world who had as their only one goal to preserve civil calm and obedience, a necessary condition to civil progress, whatever the means used for attaining that goal, torture, rape and death included, whoever were the enemies, which were to be regarded not only as enemies of the prince but also as enemies of Florence. <br /> This is a very good reading to anyone interested in the instruments politicians have at their hands and the sensation you have is one of reading, as previously said, one of the 10 best books ever written.

The centennial of the first publication of the book was commemorated in 2002 not only in Brazil but also abroad, where there are many intellectuals who are keen of everything related to the book, the so-called euclidians. &quot;Os Sertões&quot;, the Brazilian Portuguese name of the book, is an epic and was inspirational to many ancient and modern films run in Brazil about the conflict, and also to a book by  the Peruvian celebrated author Mario Vargas Llosa (&quot;The War at the End of the World&quot;), who had Euclides da Cunha as idol since his childhood. <br /> Euclides da Cunha, then a war correspondent of the very famous southern Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo,  wrote the book with a view to the conflicts ocurring in Bahia, after the so-called Proclamation of Republic, in 1889, thus ending 72 years of monarchical rule, something which upset many powerful landowners tied to imperial interest to raise arms against the new republican order. The revolt, known as the War of Canudos, as a historic fact, was eventually lost and the insurrects had to put down their arms, and the battle was won by government troops, but the War of Canudos was to enter Brazilian history as one of the cruelest ever fought in Brazil, and the government had to spend much more money than at first foreseen, losing its face in the end: how come a so strong army had so much difficulty to conquer a bunch of illiterate misers?. All this to kill the dozens of thousands of insurrected who amassed themselves in the poor village of Canudos, in the northeastern region of Brazil, the poorest region of a poor country.<br /> From the side of the mutinees, the revolt had (almost unwittingly in the beginnin) a leader, Antonio Conselheiro, a mystical man who wandered for years in the hinterlands of Brazilian Northeast, followed by growing multitudes of disposessed, who saw in him a religious man to rescue Catholic fundamental religious values of medieval importance, and to whom they follow as sheeps follow their sheperd.<br /> To sum it up, the book has all the ingredients of a good historic novel, despite its characters being non-conventional.

The Divine Comedy&quot; was written in Toscan by the Florentinian Dante Aligheri 700 years ago and is one of the most important texts ever written. Dante Aligheri is, along with Miguel de Cervantes, Willian Shakespeare and the Portuguese Luis de Camões, one of the most important writers of History, but we have to remember that Dante Alligheri was born some 250 years before each one of the latter.<br />&quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; was first published in the beginning of the 14th century and narrates a vision Dante Alligheri had of his visit to Hell (Dante's Inferno), the Purgatory and to the Heavens (Paradiso), where he is guided by the Latin poet Virgil and later on by his muse, Beatrice, deceased some years before. His narrative is full of devout catholic sentiments and he spares no expenses in narrating the torments perpetrated in Hell, described in details, where each ring or level is reserved for each different earthly infraction that the penitent has commited when alive. The company of Virgil, a permanent resident of the first hell ring, the Limbo, is a magistral coup by Dante Aligheri and adds lustre to the text.<br /> Virgil leads Dante too through the Purgatory, where, contrary with what happens in the Inferno where there is no salvation, the souls are suffering with a view to a future life in Heaven. Dante is the first and only human being that put his feet into this after life regions, and things get increasingly intense and sometimes dangerous to him. Also to be noted is the disposition of Dante to here and there sting his earthly political opponents, which were not few, banning them to hellish confines.<br /> The final visit to the supreme heavenly region, where he meets Beatrice, is suffused with catholic symbology, fully explained by Dante, who embroiders the descriptions with all the richness of his language. You end the book asking for more, and sensing intensively the powerful richness of Dante's vocabulary. I hope you enjoy the Divine COmedy as much as I did. Good reading.much as I did.

It is a bedside book, a kind of magical book, because it changes every time in your life that you get back to it, keep coming back in a total different way and perspective, adding new content to your reading and, most important, to your life.<br />The text is exquisitely rich and it seems that Cervantes always choose the right word for the right situation, something which makes the task of the translator simply phenomenal in its scope, because translating Cervantes is a contradiction in terms. It is impossible to translate him or transport the reader to the sense meaning in each Spanish word, its flavor, its colors, and so on, but the English text does the best it can be done, given the impossibility of the task.<br />In a way, the life of Cervantes was to be compared to the life of Luis de Camoes, the most important Portuguese poet and the author of &quot;The Lusiads&quot;, who, as happened with Cervantes, fougth for his life in colonizing battles. Camoes lost his eyesight in one of such battles and Cervantes lost his left arm, as he says, &quot;to the glory of the right (arm)&quot;.  But whilst The Lusiads celebrates the saga of the Portuguese people, Dom Quixote ridicules the medieval tales of European ancient knighthood, characterising Dom Quixote as a windmill stormer, which he thinks are giants trying to assail his muse Dulcinea del Toboso.<br /> Cervantes became famous in his lifetime due to the publication of the first volume of Dom Quixote, but was always assailed by the ghost of a apocriphal sequel, which delustred himself a lot, were not to the publication of the second volume of the book some 10 years later, where he gives a terminal end to Dom Quixote so he could not any more bother him with fakes. He died in poverty but was to be known by generations to come as the father of the Spanish language, the man who gave it its contours and shape, a phenomenal task in itself.e man who gave it its contours and shape, a phenomenal task in itself.	2003-12-15

The Decline of the West\\", first published in 1917, is the major contribution of the German Oswald Spengler to Western thought. And what a contribution it was!!! First of all, the work, which this edition is an abridged version, is tainted by accusations of being pro nazi and amiable to fascism in general and to Mussolini in particular , something that tormented the author all trough his reclusive life.<br /> But, polemics apart, \\"The Decline of the West\\" is a major opus, indeed a masterwork, with a dense text full of a very Spenglerianian terminology and new concepts, which added lustre to the difficult task the translator faced and settled in the best possible way. After reading the first pages, the reader realizes that he is facing the work of a man of genius, of a man endowed with a polymath knowledge and with appetite for solving the puzzles of Western History, which he revisited and intended to set to a new course. His thinker of choice is Goethe, to whom he acknowledges the foundations of his thinking, being Goethe, in Spengler's view, the first and the only one who, despite not being a philosopher in the strict sense of the world, truly understood, via the mechanism of analogies, how the Western world ascended to its present condition and would eventually fall, in the way it happened earlier with the Classic antiquity of Greece & Rome. <br /> The myth to be atacked is that Civilization is a step forward in the development of the human race, being Civilization a word that, in Oswald Spengler's view is synonimous with decadence or rather absence of Culture. The idea that the Western world is a development of things happened in classical antiquity is, again in Spengler's views, fallacious, because the Classical Antiquity vanished altogether in the collapse of the Roman Empire and our Western World began circa 1.000 A.D. One of the important tools to be reckoned with is analogies and it is used all the time to illustrate similarities in the rise and fall of earlier cultures and ours, which is to collapse after the exhaustion provoked by the money devotion present in our Western World. As it happened earlier in this final stage, some signs are important to be noticed, being the creation of so-called megopolis, or big cities, one of them, along with the surging of a quasi mythical personnage (Napoleon, Julius Cesar, Alexander, etc...) who was to be welcome by the peoples as a leader. Exactly here lies the intersection with the figures of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. It is up to the reader to judge by his own parameters if this interconnection is only ideal or was something transported into the real life of nazi German or Italian fascism. <br />Without any exageration, I should say that this is the type of book that jump-starts you in many fields of knowledge and, specially of interest, is , in my opinion, the exgese the author does of the Theory of Mathemathics as a way of explaining the different Cultural environments of Ancient Greece, Egypt and Arabian regions.         <br /> Despite this being an abridged version, I think that the present edition preserved in the best possible way the thinking and polemic points of view of the author.	2003-12-15

The British effort to build the Suez Channel, and the American on the turn of the 19th century to build the Panama Channel, are good examples of such gigantic steps the human race took in order to bridge distant lands and to easy communication between peoples of distant lands. The same could be said of the making of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), a fenomenal task both by the ample range of its scope, which was to solidify and market English as the leading language of the world, and by the number of people involved in the project. Editors? Eight. Number of pages? More than 20.000. Number of entries? More than 400.000, and so on.  The task , which initially was estimated to take some 10 years, did not reach its end before many decades passed. <br /> The Meaning of Everything, by Simon Winchester, is a detailed account of the making of the OED, and the reader is entitled to a full range of the most interesting narrative concerning the idiosincratic personalities of each and every successive editor of the dictionary, specially of the legendary Scottsman James Murray, with whom the dictionary is most commonly associated, due to the maturity of purpose the project acqurired in his experienced hands. By the way, Murray was a polymath, a man grown up in poverty but with a keen curiosity and many different interests and who spoke/read more than 25 languages. The many photographs of him and of the many editors are a good add-on to the book.<br /> The expert author guides the reader trough the intrincacies of the project, beginning with a very adequate explanation of the origins of the English language, as viewed from Victorian Britain, and its evolution trough the maze of influences the language received from Old English, Old German, French and Latin.

Behind the greatest economist of all there was the philosopher and man of culture and this phenomenal book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, shows the philosopher in his prime, portraying as the subject of his inquiries man as is, be it in the pre-vitorian time Smith lived, be it today or in ancient Greece.<br />To approach the book trough the right angle, one has to remind that one of the fundamental Principles of the Smithianian economic doctrine, as portrayed in the Wealth Of the Nations, is the one that says that when each one of us exerts himself to his utmost in order to achieve his own egotistical ends, he does good not only to himself but also to the whole community or nation in which he lives, by means of  the division of labor and specialization required in the proccess of competition. But that is not to say that Adam Smith recommended egotistical behavior to each and everyone, an economic free for all. What he only meant was to stress the importance of specialization to the incipient division of labor of his time. To add some salt in the debate, it is suficient to say that one can have many motives to exert himself in any work to attain personal goals not the least egostitical, like buying  a new home for his family, or enrolling his children in a private school. <br />But, where man feels not only for himself but has a kind of reflex feeling for the feeling or sentiments of other human beings, it is the  purpose of the book to show by what mechanisms does it happen and, sometimes, why. A good example is, to use a expression used by Smith, the different human reactions by two different men, one condemned to the scaffold, where he will sure find death, and the other punished with the scourge in the pillory. The former faces certain death but can save hisface by adopting an aloft posture in the scafold, no matter what his faults were, earning praise and respect from the multitude. The latter, comdemned to whipping and public ignominy, faces a future life of ignominy and shame , specially if he communicates via his cries to the onlookers the severity of the punishment inflicted. <br />The book is extremely rich in the narrative of many such examples of human behavior in the face of felicity or distress, and the way the spectators (to use a favorite expression of Smith) react to the suffering and blessings on others. IF you are interested in know better your human nature, and the nature of your fellow acquaintances, this is the book to read.	2003-12-03

His goals were breath taking: nothing less than to discuss the philosophical basis of the Mathematics, something of the utmost importance for men like Bertrand Russel, G.E.Moore and Norton Whitehead, the most important philosophers at the time. To all of them, and to some important Austrian and German philosophers in Wittgestein's circle,  the work of Wittgestein was to be known as a watershed event. Almost at the same time, still a youth, he was the pupil and master of Bertrand Russell, to whom he later exerted an almost opressive power, even of determining what was right or wrong in Russell's train of tought. Whenever it happened, Russell got depressive almost in a childlike manner, discarding what he did in order to attain a more solid ground. To Russell, Wittgenstein was the heir presumptive of his thinking, due to both his genius and to the vigour Wittgenstein had as a brilliant youth. <br /> But Ludwig Wittgenstein himself was a troubled soul, deeply tormented by the ghosts of three elder brothers who comitted suicide and who did not resist the pressure exerted on them by his authoritarian father, who wanted his sons to pursue a business career in the family company. Ludwig was of Jewish ascendancy but, with all his family, had to hide/disguise his Jewish background in order to be accepted in the Austrian aristocratic society where his father prospered as a businessman; Ludwig later gave up all his immense wealth to family and friends, trying to dismiss himself with all associations of his noble birth, working many years as a teacher in a fundamental school in rural Austria and later trying to work as a simple workman in Soviet Union; he enlisted voluntarily and fought for his country in the First World War, getting many medals for heroism in the battlefield, lived many months secluded from theworld in a rural cabin in Norway, and was reclusive to the point of  depression, etc..Concerning money, he was determined not to beg anyone's money (Keynes included) in order to pursue his philosophical objectives. His bisexuality was hidden, due to his propensity to hide his emotions from others.    <BR>   <BR> Despite all the peculiarities of Ludwig's life, the book does not attain the same level of the other biographies Mr.Ray Monk made on Bertrand Russel, but this maybe due to the fact that Bertrand Russell was a much more complex man, with many wives, lovers, children and friends, in my opinion, a much more popular and media attractive subject than Wittgenstein. Despite everything, the book is a pretty much good one, and guides the reader trough the intricacies of philosophical thinking.	2003-11-26

Also , the book was unfinished in his lifetime and had to be edited by his wife, who was also deceased before the full completion of the giantic task. Even so, the book has some 1.300 pages and covers the full range of all the relevant economic thougth until the time of its publication.<br />A warning sign of caution must be addressed to the non-professional readers not not fully interested in the magnitude of such a scope, that is, of addressing the formative ideas of each and every important concept in economic analisys in a so complete way. This can be an overkill for you. But if you are interested in Medieval thought, the concepts exposed by , for instance, Saint Thomas and many others, this is a very good reading. Enjoy it	2003-11-10

Keynes activities, both as an active participant of the economic life of his country and  continent, and as an icon to the cultural life of his epoch and to his many friends and groups of interest, is impressive. To define him is an elusive task: philosopher?, economist?, historian?, linguist?. He was all this and much more, but he was above all a man of a very practical mind and, notwhidstanding his immense philosophical background, deeply attached to the  theories of his contemporary G.E.Moore and others, he had the feeling of having a mission to accomplish, given the immense superiority his intellect had over the rest of the mortals. <br />What was to become of Europe after the end of the First World War was foreseen by him in many essays and primarily in his book The Economic Consequences of the Peace. The task which lays ahead for him, and only him, was to warn politicians and thinkers of the impending dangers of the years to come, specially in regard to a lack of theoretical analisys to support the transition from the old economy (classicist in his jargon), which ended with the death of the great Alfred Marshall, and a new one, which he purpoted himself to establish and then save the world. And save the world he did!!! Keynes is one of this towering figures who had the opportunity to mingle himself with daily facts and change them for the better. Amid a lot of controversy and polemic regarding the originality of his ideas, he published his major opus in 1937, which was to be used against the vagaries of rampant unemployment and inflation. His General Theory of Interest , Employment and Money is a sort of tribute he pays to his father , Malthus and G.E.Moore. <BR>In the personnal side of his life, if this can be said of Keynes for his personal life was eminently devoted to cultural interests i many areas, the book portrays some important changes in his personal atitudes towards homosexuality (he abandoned) and his new life marrying the russian ballerina Ludmila.	2003-11-07

King James was a Scottish who, by the accidents of death ascended the throne, and inagurated a new era of religious belief and persecution, principally heralded by the edition of the bible who carries his name, and was to substitute all its many famous predecessors. <br /> Amid rampant misery and plague, of London and its outskirsts, the death toll reaching sometimes 4.000 thousand persons a day, King James, a very astute and cultured man, who loved to enjoy to the fullest all the attributes of his royal position, mantained and extended his immense powers using all the handy tools at his disposal, treason, murders, lies and spies included. A man of bad temper, whenever he lost it, someone faced sudden death in the scaffolds of popularity, evading all due judicial proccess of the time.  His mind was refined and he spoke more than 10 languages (Greek and Latin included), and he personally assembled the groups in charge of the translation, designing the rules to be strictly followed, the scheme of work rotation, personally supervising much of the workload.

Democracy in America&quot; , in the abridged version of the quite voluminous full work which totals something like 2.000 pages of texts, is worthy all the money the reader spent in search of a good content and which  fully conveys the inteligent writting style and the penetrating innovative ideas of one of the most brilliant thinkers of all times, the superbly bright French nobleman , Alexis de Tocqueville, a household name in America's schools. I would be at a loss if I had to name the area of knowledge where the author impresses me most: as an historian?, as a sociologist? as an economist? as an anthropologist or a philosopher? In all of these fields of knowledge his approach is innovative, his style vivid, and his ideas spring from the seemingly endless source of his mental apparatus, certainly one of the best of his time.  Getting in first contact with such a cornucopia of new ideas and thoughts is very estimulating, specially if one has in mind that Alexis' work is not a panegeric of his condition of nobleman(after the French Revolution). Quite to the contrary, his open mindedness is revealed in the futurity he ascertains to the United States as the new economic and social power of the world, leaving behind all the decadent fashion and way of style of ancient nobility, English or French. All this in the 1830's!!!  He analyses the formative concepts of the social and economic life in the States and many of the concepts and aspects of day-to-day life of Americans are to be found even nowadays, there cemented in the social and economic life of that country.  The reader , even in this abridged edition, which very adequately compacts the two voluminous full editions, will be at in a very gainfull position to get in contact with one of the most important thinkers who has given its precious mind to study what is behind the success of the United States as a nation. As a minor flip-side the book, in a very poor paperback edition, is very difficult to handle phisically and to peruse. But, as a bottom-line, the book is so good that I will order the unabridged version to read it in totum.	2003-11-06

The quite voluminous &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; is one of the most important books of all times, and is of special interest to the reader who wants to go the extra mile in search of the reasons why the Empire collapsed after almost 1.000 years of existence. Is also a good reminder to everyone of us that, no matter what, all things pass and one world leader is followed by another in a sequence of falling cards. The book, first publishe in 1776, the same year that the &quot;Wealth of the Nations&quot; was published, and the same year the United States declared its independency,  is one of the first serious attempts to relate history in a context of sequenced facts where social, political and cultural movements were much more important than the play of personalities. Edward Gibbon lived in Geneva many years and was familiar with the most important intelectual developments of the age, being acquainted with Voltaire and his ideas, reading and writting in many languages but mainly in French. The bibliography he consulted is extensive and, even some 15 centuries after the facts he reports, his is one of the most comprehensive and authoritative analysis of the reasons behind the fall of Rome.<br />To begin with, he does not list how it all began, that is, it is not his purpose to narrate how the Empire was built. He begins with the Empire as a &quot;fait accompli&quot;, with a narrative in the rule of Julius Cesar , the philosopher ruler, and analises with endless detail all the rationale of lack of in each and every ruler's mind, the background of his ascent and the reasons behind the fall of each one of them. The vast majority of Rome's ruler was killed by people who was akin or intimate to the ruler or by members of the Praetorian guard. Also, all the meanings of the empire's hierarchy is explained with a lot of detail, what was the function of a Caesar, what meant to be a senator at the time of Rome apogee, of consulship, etc... Each one of the 3 books, totalling some 2.000 pages, has a very interesting map of Europe, Africa and Asia at the time. A lot of factual information is there to astound the reader with the polyhistoric knowledge of the author. His privileged mind does not permit him to understand that not all the readers speak the languages he does and the text is full of footnotes quotations in Latin and ancient Greek, with no translation whatsoever.<br />The portrait of the barbarians kings and people is superb and the reader has the opportunity of a face to face contact with Allaric, the king of the Goths, and with Atilla, the king of the Huns.

Not being an apologetic text, quite to the contrary, the author wants to demonstrate that what is behind the dominion of West over East is assigned to factors well beyond the control of any given human race, but mainly attributable to the play of factors not the least imputed to any race supremacy. Notwhidstanding all this, he ascertains that the earlier the domestication of animals and some varieties of staples and cereals, the more prone are human beings to be innoculated against the vagraries of some virus or disease.	2003-11-06

The concepts he developed, which is not the same to say that he discovered the fundamentals of these concepts, are of such working capability, that they can be used even today on a daily basis, some 200 + years after the first publication of his seminal and most important book, certainly one of the most important texts of all times. His name turned itself into an important adjective, malthusian, sometimes associated to a lot of misconceptions and misuse, mainly due to undue interpretations of things Malthus did not said, or did write with a different manifest meaning. Troughout his lifetime, Malthus, already a recognised and famous man, had to revise a lot of editions of his works in order to precise what he meant to say.   <br />Dipping down into the original malthusian fountain is, in this way, a pretty much refreshing and inspiring experience, shunning aside the many bad interpretations attached to his original thinking by second hand reading. As a plus, the book presents at the end two extremely beatifully written chapters on the philosophical reasons behind Good and Evil, a necessary explanation in a revolutionary theory that could be interpreted as intrinsically evilsome. To add content and lustre to all Malthus wrote, one has to remind that the greatest economist of the XX century, John Maynard Keynes, felt himself philosophically and theoretically affiliated with Malthus in a very great scale, to the point of saying that, if Malthus had been better understood, the world would not had to suffer the weaknesses of David Ricardo's theories.	2003-11-06

In Hobbes mind the most efficient form of government was monarchy, but he takes a lot of time to analyse also Democracy and Aristocracy. One has to keep in mind that the time the book was written was one of internal revolt, a civil intestine strife in England, and the objective of Hobbes was to lay the foundations for human actions conducive to an equilibrium within the state, ending war.<br />His book can be also be taken as one where many important aspects of Right and Laws are aprehended, from the perspective of a deeply religious anglican man, that tried his best to separate, in his words, the Kingdoms of men (where civil laws are imperative) from the Kingdom of God (Naturall Right). He does extensive analysis of God's Laws and its importance to the balance in the relationship between men.<br />The edition is a very good one, with a good introduction and is a copy of the text as written in the 17th century, exhibiting an archaic English sometimes difficult to understand. Also, some quotations in Greek and in Latin are not translated, despite all the effort the author makes to turn them inteligible to the reader.<br />The book could be understood as antipodal to Machiavellian's The Prince, because power is not taken here as something good in itself, but only as a means of carrying the security and hapinnes the kingdom subjects deserve.	2003-06-23

The Economic Consequences of the Peace was written in 1920 by Keynes, who was not already recognized as the most influential economist of the 20th century, a condition he would only attain when he wrote his famous General Theory some years later, and can be interpreted as a personal outburst against the heads of state of the four countries who participated in the Group of Four (France, Italy, UK and the USA) and decided the fate not only of the defeated countries (Germany and Austria) but also of the whole world, in a way that Keynes was adamantly against and which led to his resignation of his capacity of an important negotiator in the British delegation. One has also to remember that Keynes had always been against the war and lost some important friends in the conflict. <br /> The portrait he gives of the different negotiating abilities of French's Clemenceau, United States' president Wilson and British Prime Minister Lloyd George is a devastating picture of the different motives each one of them had at the time: the aim of Clemenceau was to exact revenge to French's traditional enemy and to debilitate Germany as much as possible, thus postponing her return to prosperity and to menace again France. WIlson's, portrayed as a good man but lacking any negotiating feature a man of his stature should have, was a frail man only to save his face in the moral stances he took in his preliminary 14 points Armistice proposal, which led to the initial surrender of the Germans to the Allied forces. The British Lloyd George was only worried about upcoming elections in his country and was playing all the cards (good or bad) he had to save himself from an humiliating defeat to the Liberals.       <br /> The outcome of it all was a Peace Treaty who despised each and every point of reality, representing a burden Germany would not be able to pay, thus leading to the dismantling of an economic European system that led famine, social disturbance and finally to the World War II. <br />The book is a best-seller ever since and very easy to read and should be also recommended to every one interested in the power broker skills one has to have to succeed (Clemenceau) or fail (Wilson) in negotiation as hard as this one.	2003-06-20

His father John Neville Keynes was a famous economist of his time and had many other intelectual atributes which he didn't want to put up to test in the academic arena, despite a lot of incentives by the famous economist Alfred Marshall, the most proeminent thinker of the neo-classics school of thought. Neville Keynes was determined instead to follow closely and have influence upon the professional careers of his most inteligent son. To anyone who whished to compare this situation to the education the philosopher James Mill gave to his son John Stuart Mill, I would warn he/she to be cautious cause the result is very much different than could be foresaw. <BR>What the book shows is the fascinating formative years of one of the most influential men of all times, who had a strong appetite for getting all the knowledge he could get and who didn't hide  behind his geniality. Quite to the contrary, Keynes was up for everything he could grab, be it different sexual male partners, a lot of trips to Italy and a lot of academic prizes, estimulated by the spirit of competion his father tried to assert on him, at the end to no avail. Also, the pace of his intelectual output is outstanding, being Keynes almost always pushed to the limit to do a lot of different things at the same time.  <BR>Some crude aspects of Keynes sexual life are also all there via the transcriptions of the many letters he exchanged with his male lovers and friends of the many different intelectual cycles he was part of.        <BR>His education at the noblest institutions in England (Eton and Cambridge)where he got the opportunity to intermingle with the likes of Bertrand Russell, Virginia Wolf, Whitehead and the philosopher Moore, the latter certainly the most fundamental influence he had in these formative years, provided the social and intelectual backgrounds needed to awake the geniality of the most brilliant economist of the last century.	2003-05-27

The story is of a genius who had to prove to himself that he had not lost his intelectual vigour in the ageing proccess and at the same time , balancing his mundane needs trough popular texts written to readers not specialized in philosophy and mathematics, and many other areas where he was proficient. <br /> He marriages now for the second time in his life, with Dora, with he would generate a son (John) and a daughter (Kate), began for him a new era as an educator and as a mass-comunicator, where he approached all the available means (newspapers, magazines, radio panels and lectures) in order to make money thus providing the material means for his special ideas on how to educate his  children. He wrote many books on the subject and even inaugurated a special school where his two children where educated along with the children of some upper-class Englishmen and Americans.<br /> He was two be married again twice and to have more children with Peter (yes, a very special nickname of his third wive). In terms of the outcome he got, it was nothing anyone could foresee at the beginning. <br /> To sum it up, the book is a faithful portrait of a tormented  man, surrounded by all kinds of people who loved/hated him, and who seems to destroy every  inch of happiness one could have before  getting to know him. Strange as it seems, the man who was trying to save the world with his pacifist stand against nazism, and later comunism, and all forms of totalitarianism, was incapable of understand the human nature of all people who lived with him. <br /> This is a good book to read to everyone interested in philosophy and in the life of the greatest philosopher of the 20th century.	2003-05-16

Baudolino is a very interesting book and follows the tradition of the historical italian novelist Umberto Ecco, who sprinkles the reader with a lot of erudiction and historical facts. When writting this book , he even invented a very particular language, which is used in the very first pages and which is an admixture of Greek, Latin, German and many languages the author is acquainted with in his capacity as a renowed linguist. <br />What makes this book diferent from almost everything else is that everything written comes out of the mind of the very prolific book character Baudolino, who, if we take him solely by his words, had met all the relevant/important historical characters of his time and was present at all the relevant places where History develops. Constantinopla, The Holy Grail, Popes, Emperors and Heroes, weird creatures, are all some of the many ingredients of this fictional story and in the end one has a feeling that what happened did happen only in Baudolino's mind. Or was he telling the truth from the start? Read the book and make up your mind for yourself!! You will not be let down.	2003-05-02

Also to be taken into consideration is that Keynes was especially keen of linguistics and got all the opportunities to present a very refined text with big literary value. What Keynes had in mind was to discard the useless precepts of free-hand economics, in the very tradition of early British neo-classical economists like Alfred Marshall and Stanley Jevons, and to energetically recomend state intervention to secure full-employment policies.<br /> Keynes was instrumental in many important policies adopted in the first half of the last century and along with Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Karl Marx, deserves to step to the pantheon of the most influential economists of all times.	2003-05-02

This way of addressing disturbing social questions is an Alfred Marshall trademark. <br />In this sense, his motto could well be the oft quoted \\" Natura non facit saltum\\" , which is Latin for \\"Nature does not evolves in leaps and bounds\\", and all things are going to be all right in the future but it will take some time untill they consolidate themselves into a coherent whole, where everyone in this world will have an opportunity to fully develop his natural propensities for love, companionship and free will. His view is helped by the many mathematical formulae he uses to illustrate his points of views, using differential calculus, due to his mathematical background. But the reader has not to worry if he/she is not proficient with this type of mathematical tools, because they are used only as a side-line to the text, which is dense and full of logical thinking in itself. Marshall, despite his mathematical background, didn't judge Mathematics as a fundamental tool to Politcal Economy. <br />Alfred Marshall is the most influential representant of the minimalist movement called Neo-Classics Economics (Stanley Jevons, Vilfredo Pareto , Karl Menger) and in this capacity is the most notorius proponent of what today is taught and learned in all Economics Schools over the world as Microeconomics, or the economics of particular competitive or non-competitive markets. In some way, he is both the inheritor of the Utilitarian theories of Jeremy Bentham, as of the economics doctrines of David Ricardo and Adam Smith. Also, one of the interesting facets of Marshall is that he had both John Neville Keynes (the father) and John Maynard Keynes (the son) as one of his pupils in Economics.<br /> His knowledge of History and Mathematics is astounding and if he has not reached the status of Keynes or Adam Smith, this is more due to the constraints of the Victorian era in which he wrote this book, and the influences he received, than to any lack of deep understanding of economics realities, which were indeed recognized by John Maynard Keynes himself as fundamental to the latter development he gave to the so-called Dismall Science.	2003-05-02

First of all, his name was not originally Benedict but Baruch, which is Hebrew for Benedict(\\"the blessed one\\").<BR> Second, he was the son of a well-to-do Spanish or Portuguese family who had to imigrate to the then United States of the Netherlands to escape the persecution of the Catholic Holy Inquisition, which was at its heyday in Spain and Portugal. It was in the famous tradition of Holland's liberal thinking that he grew up and began his philosophical studies, which were latter to be the foudation for great philosophers like Hegel. Third, as soon as he could, he abrogated the Jewish religion and his Jewish origins and was then anathemized ever since by the Jewish community and by his own family, to the point of being barred to share his fathers' inheritance. He appealed to court, won the case, and voluntarily did not take possession of the money. Fourth, in the tradition of a few great philosophers (Rousseau among them), he disdained all the luxuries and prestige his intellect could bring him and prefered to work as a shoemaker , devoting much of his time to his philosophical thinking, particularly targeted to some tenets of the Jewish and Catholic religions. Sure, there is many more to tell from this unique philosopher, but the reader can be sure that this is the very appeal of the book and is mirrored all the time in his reflexions. His lack of a superior knowledge of Latin, the language in which the text was originally written in the very tradition of the time, allows the reader an easy understanding of the content Spinoza tries to convey, whithout in any way jeopardizing the strenght of the philosopher's arguments. <br /> In the book, which was never his intention to be published in his lifetime, he addresses many religious and philosophical questions and one is appaled by the apparent easiness with which the philosophers runs down a lot of religious dogmas, both Jewish and Catholic, whithout any possiblity of being considered heretic. Take, for instance, the logic with which he approaches  miracles, and the reader will be astounded by the clearness of his arguments, originally developed in Latin (one of the more than 8 languages he was able to read or read/write). Also of importance is the characterization of the differences between apostles and prophets, and many more. His vision of the best way politics should be conducted - he favored his concept of democracy - is less strong but none the less interesting.<br /> This is a seminal book for everyone interested in the foundations of the modern philosophical thinking where Spinoza occupies a very important place.	2003-04-30

In this regard The Interpretation of Dreams is a prior reading which will give substance for the later reading of The Ego and the Id.<BR> <BR>Some concepts already presented in earlier books are developed more soundly in this opus, despite some confusion between the terminology, a situation acknowledge by the editor and even by the author. <br />The Ego and the Id was written in 1924 and, contrary to some earlier books by Freud which could be read by the lay person (\\" The Interpretation of Dreams\\" , \\"The Psychopathology of Every Day Life\\" , \\"Jokes and Their Relations with the Unconscious\\" , \\" Totem and Taboo\\" and many others), this one was not written for the non-scientific person, due to a lot of psychanalitical lingo he uses in the text and the difficulty faced in the conceptualization. <br />Despite all this, I think it is an useful reading to everyone interested in the history and theory of psychanalisys. The figth between the Id (which equals the Unconscious plus some conscious departments), the Ego (mainly inputed by senses perception) and the Ideal Ego (or Super-ego), who represents a kind of moral agency who reviews and criticizes all the actions by the Ego, is of special beauty and are quintessential Freudian. A pretty much intereting reading for anyone interested in the history of psychanalisys and in concepts already of working value.	2003-04-30

Moses and Monotheism was published in totum in 1939, the year Freud died in London, where he got residence along with his family to scape the Nazi persecution against Jews in Austria, where he thought he was safe.<br />The hypotheses raised in the book are polemical, and this seems to be a kind of a Freudian trademark, and they are nothing less than:<br />1- Moses was in fact Egyptian and worked as a general in the staff of the Egyptian pharaoh Ikhenaton, who urged the untill then polytheists Egyptians to adore Aton as only God and to adopt monotheism. When the pharaoh died, Moses tried to convince the Jews working at the northeast region of Egypt that they were the chosen people and to follow him. Many of the theories present in this book are in fact development of a hypothesis already raised by Freud in his earlier book \\"Totem and Taboo\\"  and represents a serious attempt at demolishing the foundations of both the Mosaic religion as Christianity. The idea is that a band of brothers opressed by the father in fact killed him, and out of a guilty feeling payed tribute to him in a series of disguised primitive rituals to honor him in group.  <br />2 - The circuncisiom was already practise at Egypt and was not something invented by Jeovah as a sign of the alliance (covenant)between Him and the Jewish people. Also, in Freud's hypothesis, Jeovah was a demi-god of the Volcanoes and many of his later  carachteristics were later adoptions of Egyptian religious tendencies by means of the Levites, who, again in Freud's view, were not the son of Levi (one of the ten tribes of Israel) but rather were also of Egyptian origin and followers of Moses, who in fact was killed by the Egyptian jews, etc...<br />If you think this is all the book portrays, you are pretty much wrong. There are still a lot of pretty much original and polemical hypotheses raised by Freud which would astound anyone unprepared for such a reading, specially the Jewish andCatholic community . One has to remember also, that Freud was of Jewish origin, and this, to say the least, adds salt to the whole story.<br />The book follows Freud trademark, not exactly a surprise for the man who said that he was \\"to disturb the nights of the humankind.\\" Good reading.	2003-04-22

In fact, one would not expect that such a type of bad development would occur between the two most important figures of psychoanalisys. It is as if Marx and Engels had broken their friendship for life and began to fight for fame and glory in front of everybody. The spoil was huge: nothing more than the primacy for fame and glory in the first steps of psychanalisys. <BR><BR>Sure, the letters span a pretty much limited space of time of no more than 8 years (1906-1914) but the reader has to keep in mind that what was at stake was the establishing of the foundations of psychoanalisys all over Europe and also in the whole World. <BR>What began as a cordial friendship and evolved into an almost father (Freud) to son (Jung) relationship, deteriorated into the most depressive fighting of personal primacy on many subjects. In this regard, it seems that the feud was initiated by Freud who considered Jung a type of his personal assistant to market the developments of his findings<BR>THe fact that this is a abridged edition does not mean nothing except that here the common reader will find the most important material exchanged by the two great men and will be saved from some meaningless material of more burocratical tone.<BR>Also of value is the introduction that ilustrates all the effort made by the two family sides to publish the letters, in spite the view by Jung that the ideal time for them to be published would be 20 to 30 years after his death.<br /> THis is a must reading for anyone interested in the history of psychanalisys.	2003-04-22

He does also adequate coverage of the oral tradition of the Iliad and Odissey, the foundations of Western literature. <BR> From Ancient Greece, to whom it devotes the greatest part of the book covering the ideas of Plato, Socrates and Aristotles, he goes to the heiday of the Roman Empire and the first steps of Christian Philosophy, to the period of the Arab conquest, Religious thought at the Middle Ages, the Scholastics thinkers, the rise of the Scientific thought in the 18th century, until the year where the book was written (1945). The at the time raging World War II gives special scope to Bertrand Russel, a notorious/contradictory pacifist, to show some philosophical schools as a spring board to Soviet totalitarianism and others to Nazism. It is interesting to note that, as happened also with other subjects in which Russell deep dived, socialisma and communism were of such issues where he many times changed his mind in the course of his long and fruitful life.  <br /> This book (836 pages)is a serious effort to portray the best minds of Western civilization in a very clear and precise light, trademarks of Lord Bertrand Russel. There you will know that Nietszche, besides praising as semi-gods persons like Napoleon, Frederic II and Julio Cesar, great men who deserved to use all the means available in order to perpetrate their indidual ends, ended his shrot life mentally insane. Also, some very negative facts of the life of the great French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau are there, like, for instance, the lightness with which Rousseau had himself disentangled from robbery accusations by fingerpointing a woman servant he knew was not guilty. Sure, despite being a very devastating malefic influence to everybody around him, Lord Bertrand Russel had a high opinion of himself, never seeming to undertand that evil doing was a two-way road, that is, that he did evil to others as they did him. <BR> In my opinion, this is a very good reading for anyone interested in Philosophy, rational thinking, theories of origins of God, theories of the State, etc..Strange as it seems, not only one woman appears as a great thinker, one thing it would not be the same if the book was written today, where the general masculine bias would be pretty much diminished. Regarding Russell, he manifestly had a clear disdain for every thought emanated from women, something Mr.Ray Monk says was determined by the fact that Lord Russel lost his mother very early in his childhood.	2003-04-17

In his Dreams book, which a very good collection of many of his dreams experiments, he is after demolishing some Freudian's dreams concepts, mainly the one which asserts that the purpose of dreams is to fulfill infantile sexual wishes repressed in the unconscious, which don't find adequate outlet trough conscious activities. <BR>To add content to this dispute, one has only to have in mind that Jung was a very ardent disciple of Freud in the beginning of his career, but the relationship turned sour after 1914 in the figthing for prestige at the foundation of the Psychanalisys in the beginning of the 20th century. <BR>In Jung's view, dreams are not only wish fulfillers, but they are also compensatory vis-a-vis our daily conscious life. So, the purpose of them is to balance our conscious and unconscious life. So, if life is good, dreams are bad and vice-versa. At the end of his life, Jung said in one of his testimonials that by means of a very representative dream he closed a circle, which meant he got a balanced mental life between unconscious and consciousness.     <br />Also, dreams should be taken not as isolated entities, but rather as a series of concatenated manifestations of the unconscious, something which could be represented by the ancient mandalas (Sanscrit for circle) of many peoples from the ancient world (mayas, hindus, polinesians, etc...), where the ultimate end is to attain a balance mind. Jung's theory of the unconscious is, in my opinion, pretty much more attractive than Freud's, specially in what it regards the timelessness of the unconscious and the unconscious collective. <br />Reading \\"Dreams\\" after reading Freud's \\"Interpretation of Dreams\\" is a magnificient experience and the winner is surely the reader, who gets the most of two of the most proeminent and polemical psychanalysts of all times.	2003-04-07

And amazing as it seems, Charles in no way was against his father decision. Were not for the help of his beloved uncle, brother of his father, who was very much in favor of the trip and convinced Charles'father to revert his earlier decision, the world would wait some more time for his revolutionary theory of the evolution of the species trough Natural selection of the fittest.<br /> A very interesting book, which has value added to it by the many letters included as appendices that treat on many interesting issues of Charles' life: the so-called Butler controversy, the letters refering to the first refusal of Charles Darwins father to his Beagle voyage and many others.

And this time trough those primitive manifestations performed by that very primitive peoples like aborigenes from Australia, North and South America indians and many others discovered by colonization european, manifestation that we are used to call by Totem and Taboo. This is the standard Freud's view on the subject and to understand this book is a necessary step to proceed to other important Freud's work like Moses and Monotheism, The Future of an Ilusion and many others, where he approaches with reluctance the idea of religion as an offspring of early animism.<br /> The prior standard way of seeing these types of primitive manifestation was to see them trough the amount of dread the primitive men have against the manifestation of some praeternatural agency, to use a term used by Mr.Thorstein Veblen, a contemporary of Freud, in his magnificent book on the leisure class (The Theory of the Leisure Class). It is worthy to note that nobody can be sure on the origins of this type of tradition and that adds substance to Mr.Freud's arguments. <br /> Sigmund Freud goes a step further to the classical view and says that totemism and taboo as animism are the manifestation of something not outside ourselves but rather inside human minds of the primitive people, where the unconscious played a good part to the forming of this kind of culture manifestation and where there is an intricate and unconscious and almost mathematical calculation in order to attribute to the priest-king, who typifies the carrier of this tradition, both the pleasures and the burden of the function. In Freud's view, both totem and taboo are traditions that have to find their origim in the unconscious of that primitive folks and not in the concurrence of fear to the dead, following the tradition of his many other books on the latent manifestations of the unconscious.

What George Orwell had in mind when he sketched this book, was to portray the big difference there is in the political world in what regards political intentions and political deeds.<br /> The story is in fact a very original political fable, where the animal characters are in a disguised way impersonating key political figures of the late USSR.<br /> The optimism of the beginning of the Russian revolution, with a lot of colorfull overtones inherited from the works of Marks, Engels and even Lenin, subsides later into sheer persecution of the characters not fit for the revolutionary task, in a shadowy remembrance of the blatant persecution Stalin engaged himself against people suspected of being dangerous to him.<br /> This book along with 1984 immortalized Orwell as a creative and preocupied man of his time against the danger of totalitarianism.	2003-03-19

No doubt he is one of the most important scholars on this very difficult subject. This does not mean that one has to agree with his very particular and innovative vision of the original place where an indo-european language was spoken. He is the first to acknowledge to arrive at any non-controversial answer.<br />  The innovative approach he brings can be summarized by his adoption of many procedural modells to approach what really happenned in terms of social and cultural interchange, and  movements in time and space. His style is convincing and his prose easy to follow despite the weighty issues he raises.<br />  In my view, I find to be pretty more convincing the hypothesis which ascribe to the Caucasian region the origin of the indo-european people, but I think that Mr.Renfrew's main contribution is to put in the forefront of the debate the tree model almost automatically adopted by all the proponents of an Indo-european people who spoke a proto language, and so exploring with major emphasis the trade-offs ocurred between the brethen inside this tree. Also, the radio-carbon datings presented are amazing and fascinating at the same time.<br />  To summ up, the book is a must to anyone interested in this fascinating issue.	2003-03-19

All the verbs I look for are there in all the available tenses. Besides, the additional 800 verbs listed in alphabetical order and related to the paradigms already estatablished in the book are also a good idea, which makes almost impossible not have All the necessary verbs one is looking for. <BR> One point is necessary to stress: what we must have in mind is that this is not a book for students of Classical Greek , only for Modern Greek, which is at the origin of the only one &quot;fault&quot; of the dictionary: sometimes it trades X for K and vice-versa, which is not the usual way I learned Greek. See, in this regard all the verbs initiated by Kata (Xata) or Kate (Xate). But, that maybe this is not the fault of the book itself, but rather of the very recent stantardization of Demotic as the official language of Greece in the 70's.  <BR> Also, as a plus, there  is sufficient explanation of the most important meanings in English of the verbs, which is not a standard in this type of book. Sure, you will still need a good dictionary to jump into more difficult meainings.

He lived a good part of his life outside Geman, due to the persecution of the Nazi regime, in Los Angeles and afterwards in Switzerland. It seems that he never felt too much comfortable to move back to German, and may be to this, he never accomplished anything which could be compaired to the stature attained by his most celebrated book, which was deeply ingrained with the German burgeois way of life of his time. Some people say that is a kind of autobiographic novel , where many of the aspects of Thomas Mann's social sourroundings and family life were portrayed in the book, with an accuracy and sharpness of a genius, who lived life sorrounded by all kinds of problems one could imagine (homosexuality, drugs, family disputes on genius primacy) but who, at the other hand, was, in his own ways, deeply affected by burgeois values and familly affection.<br />When the book was written Mann had only 25 years, which adds content to some theories that mathematical and other type of geniuses minds are in their prime when one reaches 30 years of age, thus explaining the exclamation of sir Bertrand Russel, that got fame long after he hit his intelectual prime.	2003-02-20

Think about the actual dictatorships regimes in North Korea, Irak and Cuba and you have an idea of the portrait given by Orwell. In 1984 the world is divided in three super-powers, each one of them exerting total control of the lives of its inhabitants via all the means avaiable, turning the lives of them into real nightmares. The mechanisms of control are the total repudiation of love and its demonstrations between human beings, the incentive to finger-pointing, specially among family members, etc... The politics is based upon a permanent state of war againt external enemies, with alliances alternating themselves almost in a mechanical way. Thus, power has to be exerted with its utmost potency.

This is the most important book written by Sigmund Freud and is in the Freudian tradition of writting some books which focus on difficult issues with a rather simple to understand language and fine style. The purpose of the author, in his own words, was to disturb the sleep of mankind. <br />This is the kind of book that will help you a lot in understand the mechanisms behind one's dreams and all the relationship between what Freud calls your \\"waking life\\" and your \\"dream-life\\". Before going on interpreting a lot of his and his patients dreams, something that took a lot of personal sacrifice to someone so jealous of his private life as Freud, the author introduces us to the then (1899) accepted theories of dreams, which basically took the dreams as irrational and confuse manifstations that didn't have nothing to do with our real or waking life. <br />The rationale Freud uses to demolish the anti-Freudian myths  is powerful and convincing and he even suggests that reading the book will have some effect on our immediate dream life (it happened to me). Despite quite voluminous (700 pages) it deservs the attention and the effort of all of us who want to understand what dreams are all about. Here also, one reads the first paragraphs Freuds devotes to the Oedipus complex, and one has the opportunity to explore along with Freud the mechanisms of the UCS (unconscious) and of our Conscious activities, which some decades latter would lead to the concepts of Ego, Super-Ego and Id.<br /> As a trademark the text is always polemical, remembering this same quality one faces in Marxists texts.	2003-02-10

The 1% left which is found in Collins is for me justifiable enough for having bought the Collins Unabridged dictionary, but I don't know if anybody would feel the same as I do, given the fact that I love to study words and its minimal variations. <BR>Also, some more explanations on the meaning of the words would be helpfull, but, in all, is a pretty good dictionary.	2003-01-07

The help it provides goes much beyond the one found in good and traditional Latin dictionaries, focusing on ALL the tenses of some of the most important Latin verbs, passive voices included, although it should be remembered that the purpose of this book of verbs is not to substitute a dictionary, given, for instance, its narrowness of scope when translating verbs meanings (in fact , just one meaning, which in a language like Latin may be misleading).  <br />Why 501 and not more? It seems there is no true reason behind  the number except to compete with some 201 book of verbs; in fact, there is a lot of important verbs not listed and some repetitive verbs from the so-called regular conjugations in Latin. <br />The latin sentences avaiable on the end of the page adds content to the book and help readers to better understand the meaning of the verb and are in fact a true trove of good traditional latin sentences. I just think that translating them in to English would be a plus. Don't know why some verbs are not accompanied by latin sentences (no more than 10% of the cases).<br />The verb locator is a very good idea, but it should be expanded to additional irregular conjugations. Also, the extensive listing of co-related and compound verbs in the very same page of the fully conjugated verb is a good help.<br />A table with all the so-called paradigms of regular conjugations would be helpful, the same being valid for a table with depoents and semi-depoents verbs.<br />In all, the book is a very good one, and I use it as a precious tool to help me decipher the beauty and the intrincacies of Latin. I hope you feel the same.	2003-01-06

I was totally mistaken.<br />This is in fact a book that lets you deep-dive in the ocean of the English words and everyone can use it many ways. You can read it all the way to the end, flipping ramdomly all the pages, or you can utilize it whenever you want to search for the very early origin of some English word you just read about.<br />It is amazing! To go beyond Latin or Greek in the search of the meaning of a word, and almost never be let down by the dictionary, which even includes a English word index to facilitate your search? Yes, and a lot more.<br />This is one that I truly recommend for everyone interested in learning a little more on the origins of English.	2003-01-02

But &quot;On War&quot; is one of a kind and useful to, and readable by, both the war strategist as the common reader as myself, who will gain a good insight on some  strategical and tactical points present on the decision making process a general commanding a war planning and operation has to take. Even when the author treats specific warfare matters, he wins our attention trough the richness of simple concepts, which could also be applied on a lot of human decisions, mainly business ones.<br />Cause, as Clausewits notes, after all war is a human enterprise, indeed a very brutal one, where humans are tested to their limits both in the physical exertions war demands as in the psychological level associated with it. So, it is natural that war demands some very special human physical and psychological characteristics, be them from the general who commands and plans a war attack or defense and has to keep his troops with a high morale, be from the split soldier who is alone on the front-line and , to prevail over the enemy or in order to survive, has to retain the &quot;esprit de corps&quot; the commander infused on him. <br />This in fact is not a book for reading just one time. Keep with yourself after reading, you will return to it to from time to time.	2003-01-02

But this is the beauty of it all, seeing a respected scholar paving the path to the truth with sound work and plenty of patience.<BR> <BR>  If you like to know a bit more about the origins of many languages like English, this a good book to buy.	2003-01-02
