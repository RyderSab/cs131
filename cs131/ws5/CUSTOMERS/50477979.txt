I read this book some years ago and was more impressed then than now. Unlike most authors, Mc Call actually admits that he was a an active participant in a gang rape. To actually have such a violent and humiliating crime published in one's own autobiography, the author would have to be very honest, insane or a liar.<br />As hideous as some parts of this book, I still gave this book to my nieces, daughters and other young Black impressionable females who seem to mindlessly believe anything a Black man tells them. Some months after my adolescent niece read McCall's works, she confessed that she completely broke ties with a young man she had been dating because he showed a lot of Mc Call's tendencies. Some years later, this same young man has impregnated several different women, 3 of which gave birth to his children in the same week (while he was unemployed). Today, he is doing a life sentence in prison for violent crimes.<br />As disturbing as Mc Call's work is, I have used it for good. Every mother should know where her son is at night. Also, blaming white people for your problems is no reason for McCall commiting the same sins (color casting, rape and robbery).<br />Finally, if Mc Call committed all the crimes he claims, he should now publish a NEW novel covering his efforts at some form of victim restitution to the individuals, businesses and others he has violated in his past. Well, how about it, Mr McCall?	2004-05-27

I was one of those women who opposed the concepts of this book years ago when it was first published. (...).<br />Well, here it is some years later and to my pleasant dismay, I've discovered that MOST (not all) of the concepts have been quite helpful in my social life. I have weeded out some REAL losers and weirdos among the male population. <br />Too much critcism was placed on the rather lightweight rules, for example the phone calls. But credit was not given to the authors about refusing to date married men, playing house (shacking) and liking oneself -- all three are very GOOD rules. <br />Even if you don't agree with everything (I didn't), overall this books is good. Mothers with pre-adolescent daughters should keep a copy of this book for eternity. At the very least, a young woman will NOT waste her precious time, money and emotions on WORTHLESS males.	2004-04-24

Those of you are not familiar with her, read her semi-fiction autobiography, also available on amazon.com. (Search hint: sometimes the author uses her middle initial as in Debra J. Dickerson, sometimes she doesn't.)In her previous book, this mulatto boot-licking author was raped in the military while sucking up to a bunch of White males -- tragic poetic justice, I suppose.<br />As for this book, the author's writing ability is a joke. I can't believe she sells herself as a college graduate. As to content, she describes every negative image of African Americans that we are ALL familiar with -- nothing new. The book title, is nothing more than a marketing ploy to maximize profits from White readers. Next, the author is a hypocrite for she attacks the hair maintenance choice of Black women yet she recently appeared on the 10 pm news here in southern Calif (to sell this same book) wearing a straight (aka caucasian hairstyle). <br />Here's the REAL clincher -- Debra Dickerson is married to an UNDER-EMPLOYED, lesser-educated white male and bred two children by him. He rarely appears in public with her. The author writes books like these to financially support her husband. She is little better than a well-dressed WELFARE mother. To you non-Blacks who seem to like what she says so much I ask you &quot;Would you like someone like Debra J. Dickerson to marry into YOUR family?&quot;<br />Finally, based on 2 books by this author this is my conclusion: the book is nothing new and poorly written. Ms. Dickerson really needs professional help to overcome her hideous childhood problems which motivated her to write this book. <br />Comedian Richard Pryor said it best: &quot;A Harvard education has ruined the minds of more Negroes than bad whiskey.&quot; Here's to you, Ms. Dickerson! Say hi to your husband for me -- if you can find him.	2004-03-13

This book is so much like all her others. Like most contemporary African American writers, Ms. Roby needs to write ONLY when she has something ORIGINAL to say. It seems like she and many others are simply writing to make a living. I can still recommend this book if you are into these &quot;soap opera-like&quot; plots. But for me, a pretty cover does NOT make the story more exciting, Ms. Roby. Good luck.	2004-03-07

This book like other books by Baisden is nothing more than gangsta rap in amateur book form. Any reader would come out a lot cheaper buying a CD by Snoop Dog than this poorly written excuse of a book. <br />This book is nothing more than movie plagarism, a poorly crafted rip-off of the movie Fatal Attraction starring Michael Douglas &amp; Glenn Close. In fact, the author should be sued for every penny he made off this book.<br />A good friend recommended this boring, predictable, over-priced book to me. I struggled just to get mid-ways through, then I quit reading. I didn't care at all about Julian, his daughter, or the stalker characters. <br />I felt like a purchased a lemon car by reading this book. I kept the book and returned it for a refund. My explanation was that due to the author's mispellings, laziness in character development, etc., this is a fault product. The store manager agreed. <br />All the $$$, that Baisden makes off this book, videos, tv appearances, etc. he should now spend on refining his talent in writing. I am STUNNED at this middle-aged man writing such an immature and illiterate novel. He is like a lot of &quot;A-Americans&quot; who are born and raised in the U.S. and can barely read or write. Obviously, Mr. Baisden graduated from one of the least academic public school systems in the U.S. The BIGGEST tragedy is that he has found enough &quot;mentally challenged&quot; readers to spend time and $$$ on this. <br />The good news is that if bad writing like this sells, I am becoming a writer too so I can make money off the mental patients (aka readers), as well.	2004-03-01

I just happened to be browsing through a Christian bookstore &amp; noticed the discount table of merchandise. Amidst the scores of large books with showy, attractive covers, I was attracted to this very small book with a very plain cover. Never had I heard of the author before. After glancing through this book, I purchased it and have been enlightened ever since. It's my next most important book next to the Holy Bible itself.<br />To my fellow believers in Christ, I say, &quot;Powerful truths are published in small, plain covers.&quot;<br />This book gets you back to the basics of holiness of God and deliverance through the blood of Christ Jesus. Here the author covers the foundations of our faith and hope. When was the last time you heard a sermon or even a weekday bible study on the power of the blood of Jesus?? <br />Think about it. Then purchase 3 or 4 copies of this book and mail/give it to your family, friends and yes, the pastor/teachers of your church. This is my first reading of this author's works but it won't be my last. Please buy, read and mail several copies of this book.	2003-11-08

I know this author is commercially successful & I am politically incorrect but I don't care. Somethings must be said.<br />This book is wonderfully written and sounds very, very good on the surface.

So I went purchased the book. Silly me!<br />It does not take a lot to wonder why this author remains anonymous.<br />Like most readers, I enjoy a well-placed, creatively described sex scene in any book. In this book, the sex scenes were like what a child might write on the bathroom wall in an elementary school. Really! I mean this book isn't good enough to be called porn or erotica.<br />Also, it doesn't take a lot of imagination to figure out that this author is a MALE! Yep, that's right! I just \\"know\\" Zane is a man. Messing with the small minds of sexually deprived, Waiting-To-Exhale sistahs!

I watched the movie version of this book and cringed in my seat from embarassment! To think Forrest Whitaker (an African American producer) directed this rather sexually childish movie is a complete disgrace.<br />The book version, however, was much better than the movie although that's not saying much since the plot is the same:<BR>LORETTA DEVINE'S character is a sexless, fat, loud Black woman with no life of her own (Hattie MacDaniel in Gone with the Wind).<BR>WHITNEY HOUSTON'S mother actually encourages Whitney to sleep around -- even with an obviously married man (horrible).<BR>ANGELA BASSETT'S character was in love with her marital status more than her husband & blamed her husband's White mistress for the breakup (childish) and Angela decides to destroy his possessions (what, instead of him?. Go figure.)<BR>Oh, and LELA ROCHON'S character -- she equates sex with love, a surefire way to be on the losing end with ANY man.<br />So there's both the book and the movie. Is there any wonder these characters had the lives they deserve? While the author's writing is breathtaking, this book comes off as degrading to Black women and negative on Black males.<br />I am sure Ms MacMillian made a lot of money off this depressing stuff.

Every church should have this book, especially those in fields of counseling, psychiatry and healing.<br />The author, Neil T. Anderson, has a refreshingly concise and clear approach in his writing. He doesn't just use Scriptures as mere footnotes. He states the power of Christ and the enslavement of sin and the reality of Satan. I use the word &quot;state&quot; instead of &quot;preach&quot; because preaching, as it is seen in today's churches,  doesn't even begin to touch the power of this book. <br />Hey, do yourself a favor.

The enemy includes brainwashed, confused, educated idiots who are \\"African Americans\\" by nothing more than ancestral procreation. <br />What is the 21st century warning of an MLK event which happened in 1958?

D. Jakes. It was only because so many sistahs were talking about how good he and it is. Yes, it's a good read, with some valuable tidbits. In reality, TLHL&HL is really an Oprah-like \\"self-help\\" book with biblical scriptures as nothing more than mere footnotes. <br />I believe this book appeals to so many female readers because women fail to meditate on the REAL Word (Holy Scriptures) every morning and night as they are commanded by God. <br />Think about it. Don't you think it's strange how Jakes objects to women preachers yet if you watch TBN women are constantly around him? Why do nearly all of his books have pictures of him on the cover OR the bookcover is shiny, metallic, etc? Have you ever listened to his \\"Sacred Love Songs\\" CD? (Disgusting!) Did you know that at Jakes' church in Dallas most of his members are \\"paupers\\" while Jakes and his wife enjoy great luxuries? Why is Jakes so popular that he appeared on the cover of Time/Newsweek magazine a few months ago? Did he really support the then-Presidential Republican candidate (also of Texas) with generous financial support?<br />No, I am not being critical.

These same men would end up madly in love with or marrying an unattractive, total b----! Thanks to this book, I realize being &quot;good&quot; meant being a doormat for a man to wipe his feet on. This book has helped me recently screen out a date who turned out to be very dangerous. In the beginning, he appeared perfect but then he called me far too much (3 times a day, at odd hours) and inviting himself to my home (he never learned where I lived, thank God!). When I stopped calling him, he went into a rage and left me. Just days later he began dating another woman who let him into far too much of her personal life. He stole her identity and threatened violence against her and her family. He is now incarcerated. This could have easily happened to me had it not been for &quot;The Rules&quot; about phone calls, not letting him know too much too soon, etc.<BR>I don't care about what the critics (especially men) say.

Every author I've  known who self-published was very sure to utilize a professional  proofreader/editor prior to sending the manuscript to press. By not doing  so, Baisden has demonstrated to me that he is lazy, greedy, insincere, and  disrespectful to his readers by publishing a faulty product.<br />Also, the  author needs to do his homework and research the subject(s) he is trying to  write about. It is very obvious that he is writing from his imagination  about affluence. Baisden has a credibility problem and I would never call  him a real &quot;writer.&quot;<br />I guess I heard to much publicity about  his book. Then I read it. I guess this type of writing is great for the  young, hip-hop, gangsta rap, inner city adolescent. Escapism. I wish the  author and his audiences well.	2000-05-25

This book has helped me where I am most weak in my walk in Christ -- my prayer life. Until this book, I just couldn't quite get it together. This book on Praying the Scriptures is simply wonderful. By the power of the  Holy Spirit, I can begin to worship the LORD with due reverence to His  holiness. My thanks to Evan B. Howard for a job well done!	2000-05-21

I accidentally ran across this book in a bookseller superstore here in southern CA. Once I saw the cover, I VERY slowly opened it as I sat on the floor in the aisle. I can only guess that I sat there on the floor at least  30 minutes.<br />There are no words ...<br />A couple of weeks later, I took a  friend to the same bookstore. On the way there, I told him nothing about  the book. When we arrived, I simply handed him the book, still telling him  nothing. He, too, could have sat on the floor 30 minutes. The only reason  he didn't was because a white female customer kept trying to distract him  by recommending an &quot;excellent&quot; book on Black history (other than  Without Sanctuary). He said little to her. As she kept babbling, other  people in this huge bookstore began to look curiously at him and her. I  became very nervous. <br />There are no words ...<br />What  I can say is that I wondered why someone would publish a book like this.  How did the authors obtained SO MANY horrible photographs? And the authors  found NAMES for the victims. I wonder about the survivors -- NOT of the  happy, White onlookers and participants, for we Black Americans know and  see such people everyday. Instead, I wonder about the survivors of the  VICTIMS, especially of Laura Nelson and her young son hanging by their  necks from a bridge while scores of murderous Whites looked on  indifferently or with glee. Perhaps someone, anyone, might find the   murderers and bring them to justice. Many of them are still alive, I am  sure.<br />There are no words ...<br />I am profoundly saddened, angered and motivated by this book. The  only reason I gave the book 4 stars was because I feel so awful for the  victims and their families.<br />There are no words ...<br />This books should be  in every African American household. Parents, grand parents and other  elders  need to sit down with their children and discuss their firsthand  experience. The hip-hop generation should especially be taught by their  elders. This book underscores the debt we young Black Americans owe people  such as Dr. Martin Luther King.<br />Yeah, I know, I keep saying, there are no  words ..  yet I am still writing. Sorry for this long review. You need not  publish this.	2000-05-20

I believe the sick publicity surrending Simpson murder case played by the media to overshadow the Rodney King case.<br />Also, I did NOT pay for this book. I borrowed it, thank goodness. The author (along with MANY others)  have earned &quot;blood money&quot; vice profit from this murder case.  Anyone who writes a book about this bizarre and ugly case should be  ashamed.	2000-05-20

She was so busy marketing this &quot;sensationalism&quot; that she forgot to get an editor or better yet a ghostwriter.<br />Now to the content and themes of this book. I will not be as angry as other reviewers because that is the primary intention of the author -- sensationalism, instigation, controversy, etc. between black men and black women. She simply wants financial gain. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if &quot;she&quot; is in fact causasian and/or a male. Why has no one ever heard of her? Why is she in hiding? My goodness, this girl is illiterate!<br />This could have been a great book. Instead it read an awful lot like KKK writing to me, based on gender instead of race. If you want a good expose on the misguided thinking of Ms. Ali and her cohorts (masquerading as an Islamic religion), check out Frederick K. C. Price's tapes and/or books on Race, Religion and Racism and what this Christian pastor has to say about the Quran.  If nothing else, at least his book reflects some professionalism and basic education. (Hint, hint, Ms Ali.)<br />By the way, readers, have you ever noticed that most relationship authors like Mr., oops!, Ms. Ali never disclose any aspect on their own marriages/ relationships? Food for thought.	2000-05-19

I will not be as emotional as others who denounce this pseudo-literary attempt by this relatively unimportant &quot;author.&quot; She is nothing more than a continuation of Carlyle, Bell Curve, Shockley, etc. Again, nothing more and nothing new. This false research paper of a book is nothing more than anti-Afrocentric -- with little to no evidence presented to support her claims. .... <br />If you desire to be semi-objective, start by reading Return to Glory by Joel Freeman and pay careful attention to his footnotes. .... <br />Now, I've gotten all that off my chest. I feel a lot better. I hope AMAZON.COM places my review along with all the others who praise Ms. Leftkowitz' efforts.	2000-05-17

The author basically brainstormed many facts to the reader. Nearly all were fascinating and interesting. <br />However, Sharp, fails to provide an adequate bibliography,  footnotes or other sources for her facts and quotes. Also, she included too  many sarcastic captions (via comic book fashion) which were very degrading  to Black Women (and the crass language was not appreciated either). For  these 2 reasons, I give this book only 3 out of 5 stars. <br />The author has  wonderful information but did not treat the subject of Black Women in world  history with the respect and sacredness it deserved. Nevertheless, the book  is a good start. I recommend with hesitation. For immediate follow-up: a  better, more scholarly book is Ivan Van Sertima's Black Women in Antiquity.	2000-05-14

Notice I refer to the cassettes and the companion book as an EXPERIENCE as I both listened to and read the REVEREND King! Although the media focused on the visible part of his ministry, the civil rights movement, his sermons  are profound and awesome in their implications for today as well as their  in their powerful delivery during the mid-1950's through 1960's. Although I  will cherish both the cassette series and the book, it is through hearing  the SPEAKING of Dr. King that really made me breathless! Thank you LORD God  for sending us your messenger Dr. King to give us a wonderful earthly  ministry for a brilliant and brief time (much like Jesus Christ). Simply  awesome!	2000-05-04
