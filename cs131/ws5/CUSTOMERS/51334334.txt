US	51334334	R1NHL3CHA9DA99	0151010749	382155161	The Ghost Writer	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Almost perfect ghost story	If artist M.C. Escher wrote, he might have written The Ghost Writer by John Harwood, a wonderful mystery/ghost story that I read over the last few days. The book is evocative of old gothics - Wilke Collins with a smattering of Henry James  - Turn of the Screw thrown in as well as references to James by the author.  <br /> <br />The novel is a rich tapestry, layered, complicated and (my only quibble) just a bit too confusing,  It's not a fast read, but is an absorbing one. The author is extremely good at building a compelling tale that twists and turns upon it self mirroring itself as it goes.  <br /> <br />Iif you like \\"old fashioned\\" ghost stories - this is a fine gothic tale that I highly reccommend, though I wish his editor has pushed him a little bit more at the end. In keeping with the subtle way the tale was told the reader is left with a few too many questions and no hint to how to figure them out. It needed one damn line of explanation. (I went back and reread the last 30 pages three times but never found that one line.)  <br />	2004-08-15

Luch and evocative, it manages both to tell a tale worth telling and to keep you turning pages. Dunant captures the 15th century world of Florence and steeps you in its history without ever getting bogged down. The perfect blend of emotion, plot, description and delight. The art is described as lovingly as the relationships. A treasure.	2004-06-11
US	51334334	R1P99DT7OPHAGU	0374103909	198993018	After	Books	1	7	10	N	N	Disappointing	One wonders if the author of this book acutally has ever spent any time with victims of the kind of tragedy she writes about. The very concept of the book is bizarre at best and insulting at worst. <br />Additonally the  novel  - which isn't erotic  despite the hype - does not seem to come from a place of great caring but rather a place of self importance.  The writing, while tight, is minimalistic to a fault and makes too great an effort to be &quot;well written&quot; rather than get to the heart of the characters. It reads like an short story experiment rather than a strong work of fiction.	2004-05-22

I read this novel on my vacation in Paris and on the day I finished it I went to the Cluny Museum to see the Tapestries for myself. I'd seen them ten years ago, but seeing them again, after reading Tracy Chevalier's book brought them to life in a way that was utterly magical.<br />As she did with The Girl With the Pearl Earring, (but even better this time since she has matured as a writer) the author takes a classic work of art and artfully spins a tale inspired by the original which becomes an original itself.<br />That the actual art work exists adds to the magic. The magic adds to the actual art work.<br />Chevalier's imagination, her grasp of history, her attention to the senses, to details, to the soul of both artists, artisans and lovers are all as lovely  as the tapestries.<br />Not a stich is missing, not a word is extraneous or misplaced. Bravo.	2004-01-11

Her sensitive portrayal of a birth mother and an adoptive mother and the tragedy and escasty of what brings them together and then drives them apart is an outstanding accomplishment. Managing to never dismiss or diminish the emotions of any of the so true to life characters in this novel, Leavitt keeps the reader engrossed and caring, and at least for this reader, occassionally crying.<br />Leavitt, author of seven previous novels, wings her way effortlessly through a laybrinth of emotion that never gets cloying as it illuminates the conflicts of the human heart.<br />Well done.

That alone makes Weber worth reading. So many novelists write the same book over and over, rehashing their own discoveries --   when I find a novelist who doesn't --  its worth noting.<br />Weber's writing is always spare and pared down. Nothing excessive. But still full, rich, and in the case of this novel, funny and even sweet. <br />Weber always makes an effort  to look depper and unearth some truth in her fiction.<br />In this case, it is amusingly, the line between fiction and fact, and the way novelists use reality. The novel succeeds in doing that admirably and I personally found the marginalia one of the most interesting and charming parts of the novel.<br />I'm guessing that this book will become part of many college classroom reading lists for what it says about literature and how we are meant to read between the lines of what an author chooses to tell us.	2003-10-01

Stan Pottinger's book kept me turning pages, kept me guessing,  kept me up at night, and kept me desperately hoping that what happens in the book can not and will not happen in real life. <br />What makes it so good is that is yes, this book has a stunning plot that twists and turns, and yes, it has a stunning female heroine and a stunning fiend at the helm, but more importantly: <br />All too often suspense or thrillers have only one premise - good vs evil -- THE LAST NAZI has that too, of course -- but it has more. This threat is not just to society at large but is played out on a very personal scale with the main characters so that you - the reader - feel it and respond to it in a far more immediate way. <br />Nothing about this book is a disappointment. And everything about it sheer excitement from the very first page to the last.<br />Note to the author: This book demands a sequal. And I can't wait.	2003-08-04

Tired of &quot;important&quot; books that this magazine or that one tells me to read. <br />Instead I've started spending more and more time browsing in the library. I take an hour or two off and wander through the shelves just picking up books that look interesting, starting them, putting them down, or checking them out.<br />Friday yielded a treasure. The title is The Cabinet of Curiosities -- by Douglas J. Preston, Lincoln Child. It's a science-based thriller about the hunt for a seemingly immortal serial killer at work in New York City.<br />It caught my eye but I can't even tell you why since was spine out on the shelf. And I just spent the next two days totally engrossed in this completely engaging book. <br />Great detail, amazing research and crisp scary writing that is still giving me chills even though I returned the book to the library this afternoon.<br />How is it that I've never heard of Lincoln Child &amp; Douglas Preston? If I had to describe their writing I'd say there's a bit of Jules Verne, a bit more of Edgar Allen Poe, some of the sensibility of Thomas Harris crossed with - no never mind the comparisons. This is a books that gives you goosebumps and shivers and keeps you up all night saying to yourself, &quot;Just one more chapter and then I'll go to sleep. Just one more.&quot;<br />The Cabinet of Curiosities is one of those wonderful novels that makes you so very thankful that there are still story tellers out there who care about delivering one very difficult thing - a great page turner.	2002-10-08

Yes, but Brian Howell's The Dance of Geometry is as different as Chevalier's Girl with A Pearl Earring is from Weber's The Music Lesson and as different as Vreeland's Girl in Hyacinth Blue is form the other two.<br />Here, in The Dance of Geometry we have for the first time Vermeer as the central figure - not seen through another character's eyes. From his childhood and apprenticeship in 17C Holland, Howell deftly takes us into the painter's world - both the physical and the two dimensional world of the paintings.<br /> How the artist's vision grows and how his obsession with geometry develops is as fascinating how the man Vermeer lives his life and the drama that unfolds in these pages. <BR> <BR>Howell has painted a luminous story about the master of light.
