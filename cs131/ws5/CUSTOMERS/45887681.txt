As always, his characters are always working against time, his pace is fast and his plot wrenches back and forth--his story turns are almost impossible to pick. Deaver loves closing a chapter vaguely, letting you *think* you know what happened, then suddenly changes direction when you pick the thread back up a few scenes on. You realise that what he wrote *was* entirely accurate, but that it was some assumption of yours that caused you to jump to a conclusion. He also loves leaving the reader off-balance, dying to know what comes next. <BR> <BR>The Stone Monkey is a very good cat and mouse tale, with (for once) the bad guys just a step or two behind the good guys. Just when you think one is going to outsmart the other,  something happens to ratchet the tension up another notch. His prose is terse yet eloquent, with no unnecessary flab, just razor-sharp observations and great scene-sketching that disclose a superb authorial eye. <BR> <BR>There were a couple of things I found niggling, but not enough to put me off. One was a habit he picked up in the Blue Nowhere which I find annoying and hope he stops--Deaver goes a bit over the top in trying to salt the novel with little bits to add verisimilitude (here, dividing chapters into \\"the hour of the rat\\", \\"the hour of the rooster\\" to add a bit more supposedly authentic Chinese flavour) which I found a bit forced and hollow. It's like he consciously hunts for little gewgaws to stash in his prose, but they just feel ... fake. The other is that it became a little easy to pick the Ghost towards the end--his general motivations weren't all that clear, and a few confusing sequences needed to be explained, but it suddenly became clear what Deaver still had stashed up his sleeve, and, sure enough, it let the book down a bit to see I was right. <BR> <BR>That said, the Stone Monkey still has Deaver's trademark suspense--the underwater sequence in particular will have you white-knuckled, and you can really feel the tension mount in some beautifully-written scenes. Great stuff, and glad to see the Blue Nowhere was just a bit of an aberration. 4 1/2 stars. <BR> <BR>If you like this, you will like his others, and also check out his \\"location scout\\" series--some of the most gorgeous prose I've seen in a thriller, as well as a great plot.	2002-09-29
US	45887681	R29R2ZD2R9R4IQ	0316154059	817062475	City of Bones	Books	5	5	6	N	N	This book ROCKS	Connelly is one of my favourite story-tellers and I always look forward to reading his latest. This was no exception. City of Bones is a superb book, one of the few that I get so absorbed in that I lose track of everything else that's going on. <BR> <BR>In Harry Bosch, Connelly has created a detective who will become a modern classic, a tortured, all-too-human man who is also a gun gumshoe. Connelly's two biggest strengths are his dialogue--he is the Joss Wheedon of novelists--and his prose: concise, hard-boiled, gritty, observant, detail-oriented and Raymond Chandleresque. When you add in that he is a pretty mean plotter, too, it's easy to see why his books are so great. <BR> <BR>City of Bones opens in a fairly unremarkable way, and everything seems to unfold in a logical and believeable manner. It's only when you look back at the end of the book that you realise just how ingenious and incredibly well-told the tale is, how the events just fit together and take on a life of their own. It is proof that you don't have to invent the fantastic to tell a good story--properly approached, even the most banal &quot;real life&quot; can contain some amazing ideas. <BR> <BR>This book was a sheer joy to read and, as always, I look forward to the next. I won't spoil it, just grab it and read. If you haven't read any of his others, I highly recommend reading them in order and saving this for last, like a great dessert at the end of a sumptuous meal.	2002-09-29

I read &quot;The One That Got Away&quot; by Chris Ryan, who escaped this mission, and then &quot;Storm Command&quot; by Sir Peter de la Billiere, who commanded the UK forces in Desert Storm and who formerly commanded the SAS. <BR> <BR>At the time, &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot; seemed to confirm my view of the SAS as the world's premier elite unit, up there with the US's Delta Force and Israel's Sayeret Matkal. The tale that Andy McNab tells shows how training, guts and determination could overcome botches like being dropped too close to a hive of Iraqi soldiers with faulty intelligence and poor radio gear. The story of how the unit adapted to adversity was inspirational. <BR> <BR>There's only one problem. Much of it is not true and I feel kicked in the teeth by the betrayal. Pick up a copy of &quot;The Real Bravo Two Zero&quot; by Michael Asher, published by Cassell &amp; Co, ISBN 0-304-36436-3 in May 2002. The author is a former SAS trooper who has spent many years travelling in Arab lands. He read Bravo Two Zero and The One That Got Away and felt there was something wrong with them, apart from the fact that they flatly contradicted each other in many places. So he went into Iraq with a film crew and did some detective work.  <BR> <BR>Amazingly he found the original drop zone and all of the other significant sites in the book. He met the Iraqis who were on the other side and finds artifacts of the mission. The Iraqis (who were ordinary farmers and who, as we see, have no reason to lie) confirm the basic details of what the book says, but they (together with Asher's GPS) show up that many of the really heroic parts were exaggerated or plain made up by McNab!  <BR> <BR>For example, McNab exaggerated the distances they covered (journeys he says were 70km were actually 2km) and made up whole incidents (most of the combat scenes, the brutality of the Iraqis apart from the interrogators). Far from causing hundreds of Iraqi casualties, the whole patrol appear to have caused none. And, most importantly, Asher clears the soldier who McNab and Ryan blame for much of what went wrong.  <BR> <BR>Ryan's book, Asher concludes, was much more accurate except for three incidents: what Ryan said the wrongly-blamed soldier did; and the two combat incidents he lists. Ryan's story was epic and amazing, and it is a shame he had to make up some parts unnecessarily to make himself seem more glorious and brave than he was. His treatment of the poor soldier seems to be ex post facto justification of Ryan's own failure. McNab's story, too, would have been great if he kept to the real details, but he appears to have embellished it to sell copies of his book, sure in the knowledge that no-one could ever show him up. Well, Asher has.	2002-05-19

This book caused a stir among anti-gun activists when it was released. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately for those who would support Bellesiles' argument, the book is based on fabricated and falsified \\"data\\". (See eg New York Times, December 8, 2001, story by Robert Worth). As that article notes, to use but one example of many glaring flaws: \\"in his book, Mr. Bellesiles writes that of 186 probate inventories from Providence, R.I., recorded between 1680 and 1730, \\"all for property-owning adult males,\\" only 90 mention some form of gun, and more than half the guns were \\"evaluated as old and of poor quality.\\"  <BR>At least three scholars have independently examined the same archive and found that 17 of the estates in question were owned by women; that some estates lacked inventories, and that of those that had them, a much higher percentage than Mr. Bellesiles reported contained guns; and that only 9 percent of the guns were evaluated as old and of poor quality.\\" <BR> <BR>The only utility of this biased, flawed polemic is to show how easy it is for a weak mind to succumb to an ideological agenda and be motivated to commit academic fraud. True scholarly studies show that--whatever revisionists would now like to be the case--there was a high rate of gun ownership in colonial and later times, and the gun culture and second amendment permeated American life perhaps more than even now. Anyone who wants to argue about this area in modern times, whatever their views, must accommodate--not deny and falsify--this past.  <BR> <BR>Do not buy this book new, as you will be rewarding fraud. If you must obtain it (and it is worth reading to see what is out there in this debate) buy it second hand.	2002-05-19
US	45887681	R33SQ1XM3DBC38	0446602612	243715630	The Poet	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A very good book	I have just re-read &quot;The Poet&quot;, which is the book that got me onto Michael Connelly, and I see again why I liked it the first time around. I remember thinking at the time that the ending was &quot;Hollywood&quot;, in that it seemed that the author wanted a film made out of it. Not necessarily bad; just different. You can't expect an author to bring out perfection every time, and the variety you get from trying out these sorts of things is usually a good thing.<br />What's good about the book? Great gritty descriptions; interesting characters; great dialogue; very interesting plot. It's the sort of thing that will captivate you if you're interested. And you have to pay attention. Some reviewers have bitched about the book, saying &quot;people can't kill or hurt someone else while under hypnosis&quot;. That's true. But, if you read carefully, no-one in the book does. Other people complain about the ending being totally &quot;fake&quot; or &quot;unpredictable&quot;. If you pay attention as you read, you'll notice a number of subtle clues that point the way. Probably too subtle for some. Re-reading this book is like watching &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; or &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; a second time; you get a lot more out of it. And some people complain that the plot has holes -- on reflection, I can't agree. I thought it was very tightly (and very well) plotted. Things pull together at the end, not apart.<br />The bad parts? There aren't many. ....<br />All in all, grab this book. If you like it, or even if you like most of the book but not the ending, you will like Connelly's others.	2001-05-17
US	45887681	R2Z2EZPG2ARUD9	0553583298	392561776	Hard News (Rune)	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Quite good fun	One of the bonuses of Deaver's current success is that some of his previously out-of-print books have been put back in print and are now accessible to a wider audience. I  thought that &quot;Hard News&quot; was very entertaining, even though I don't find Deaver's earlier work as good as his more recent, nor his Rune series as good as Lincoln Rhyme.  Deaver has depicted Rune expertly, making her personality so vividly clear that her ditzy behaviour actually grates as it would in real life (the restaurant scene is particularly memorable).<br />Rune's adventures are always fun; Deaver seems to let himself go more and throws out some immensely amusing one-liners that do not seem to appear as often in the more sober Lincoln Rhyme series. Several had me chuckling out loud. He also manages to throw in his signature snippy/school-marmy grammar lesson, this time quite early on in the book. And as with all his works, you can't guess the ending unless you throw in at least three major surprises/plot changes -- a device still fun even after reading nearly ten of his books.<br />All in all, good fun reading for a plane or train trip.	2001-03-18
US	45887681	R8FTPC5IUV2SQ	0380978954	476581890	The Truth: A Novel of Discworld	Books	5	12	12	N	N	A superb book	&quot;The Truth&quot; is up there with Pratchett's best. I don't know if it is because I enjoy the Guards series most or because Pratchett did something special for the 25th Discworld novel (can you believe it?!) but this book just rocked ... (it was a book with rocks in, even).<br />&quot;The Truth&quot; is another social semi-satire, like &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; or &quot;Soul Music&quot; but one which does not set out to preach a social message as much as just create plain good fun. All of the favorite Ankh-Morpork characters are in there but there are some great new ones, particularly Otto von Chriek, a reformed vampire hired as an iconographer for the Discworld's first newspaper, the book's namesake. Once you recall Pratchett's favoured method of creating flash photography and the effect this may have on said vampire, (not to mention the general nature of vampires) you should start to glimpse the boundless humorous possibilities.<br />As always, Pratchett's knowledge of the human psyche (headology) is superb and his characters are a joy to watch (er, read?). The dialogue and behaviour of the Patrician, in particular, is a study in mastery of human psychology and behaviour. Many of this book's passages made me laugh out loud, (as always, embarrassing on an aeroplane), and this is always a good yardstick -- I laughed more than I could remember than for any other book in the last 2 or 3 years.<br />If you are a Discworld reader, grab this book and dive in. If not, read a few of the Guards series and those with a similar theme (&quot;Guards, Guards&quot;, &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, &quot;Soul Music&quot; should do it) in order to best appreciate this one.	2001-02-18
US	45887681	RKVB7NP1KL23V	0061020710	181852028	The Color of Magic	Books	5	7	8	N	N	A modern classic	I always feel a little upset when an author that I thought of as my own personal discovery suddenly makes it big and becomes a best-seller. Often (eg Patricia Cornwell) it is a prelude to disaster for the books and characters you have come to love. Thankfully, Pratchett has only gotten better since he rocketed to stardom. As a British paper's headline read in 1999 about (I think) the Booker Prize, &quot;just give Pratchett the award and be done with it&quot;.<br />Terry Pratchett is an amazing man. He is phenomenally funny. In person (if you can ever see him give a speech, go -- he had the Oxford Union in stitches); via computer (he used to lurk on alt.fan.pratchett and write hilarious comments under his own name, gracefully accept adulation, answer questions (cf Robert Jordan!!), engage in discussions and accept input(!)); and, most importantly, on paper.<br />Simply put, the Discworld is one of the best humurous series ever written. It's not because of the milieu (fantasy) or the slapstick/satire in the books. It's because Pratchett has such a great insight into human nature: his humour comes from putting believable people with familiar traits in outrageous situations, and watching their reaction. His puns, wordplay and accurate satire of society are only icing on the cake.<br />The Colour of Magic sets this in motion with perhaps the most beloved wizard in fiction apart from Harry Potter - Rincewind, an inept, bungling, proudly cowardly almost-failed wizard who bumbles his way into and out of all sorts of danger. Although Pratchett's style is slightly rawer in his first couple of books (in my opinion, reaching full maturity around &quot;Small Gods&quot;) he is still outrageously funny and already possesses his scythingly accurate view of people and society. <br />If you read this book you will be in grave danger of getting hooked on the most addictively and uproariously funny series ever. Don't worry, it's well worth the ride.	2001-02-10
US	45887681	R16ATE3MIJ0BF1	1875998667	429997645	The Coroners' Conscience	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A very enjoyable book	&quot;The Coroner's Conscience&quot; is a very well-crafted and enjoyable book. Uniquely for a legal thriller, it is  predominantly character-driven: the story is not propelled by action but driven by a  juxtaposition of  the experiences of complex and very believable characters. There is no true hero and no true villain but a procession of ordinary, every-day characters dealing with a coroner's inquest.<br />The story is well-told in a mixture of present action and flashback style, hiding the story's main question: who killed the victim? As events unfold, a number of suspects become more, then less, then more likely  to have done it, as motive and opportunity appear and recede.  I could never be sure of the ending up until the last couple of pages, a sure sign of a well-crafted mystery.<br />The courtroom dialogue is brilliantly portrayed, which is unsurprising as the author is a veteran of the Queensland and Australian bars. His ability to capture the legal process is uncannily good, leaving Grisham in the shade. The psychological portraits of each character are also superbly drawn, matching many traits of people you know in real life. Finally, as a bonus, Callinan captures the character of eastern and inner Sydney in the 50s-70s superbly well, a snapshot of a bygone age.<br />Most interesting of all, however, is that Callinan is a Justice of the High Court of Australia - the equivalent of the Supreme Court of the United States. As such, this book is a near-unique entity: a work of fiction penned by a sitting judge of an ultimate court of appeal. This makes the book even more fascinating.<br />I really enjoyed this book and recommend his other, &quot;The Lawyer and the Libertine&quot;. A thoroughly enjoyable read, really worth getting hold of. Five stars.	2001-02-10

Pratchett hones the entertainment from the interplay between cynical Rincewind and naive but advanced Twoflower, his travelling partner.<br />We follow the heroes getting into and out of all sorts of messes and enjoy the sheer briliance of Pratchett's wit and wordplay (better if not as good as Oscar Wilde) along the way. If you haven't read &quot;Colour of Magic&quot;, get it, and then get this book too. You'll likely go the whole series -- hours of enjoyment.	2001-02-10

Although he always has some fairly deep and philosophical messages in his writing, they are usually so well hidden by the humour that you don't realise they are there. In &quot;Jingo&quot;, I found there to be a bit less humour than normal and, as a result, the political undertones to the book rather stood out sometimes.<br />Don't get me wrong -- Pratchett's message (at its most basic level, without spoiling any of the plot, that war is silly) is quite profound, but it is rather jarring when it appears, uncovered, in parts of a book that is ostensibly a comedy. I usually love the Guards series of books the most (&quot;Guards, Guards&quot; is possibly one of his best books), but I feel that this is probably the weakest of them. It  is most like &quot;Feet of Clay&quot; but does not have as much suspense.<br />Still, a worthwhile read and a good book for a rainy day.	2001-02-10

Pratchett has singlehandedly created his own genre and has garnered himself a huge following -- and it's easy to see why. &quot;Small Gods&quot; has to be one of the wittiest books ever written, with incredibly sharp one-liners, in-jokes and pratfalls. Great names and clever words hide subtle parodies and satire, which are a bonus as the plot is entertaining enough on its own.<br />I tried to read this book in contracts class when it first came out and kept on getting busted for laughing out loud, no matter how much I tried to hide it. The only other author able to do this for me is PJ O'Rourke. If you read it on public transport, people will look at you and think you're kinda strange, unless they too know who Pratchett is, in which case they will envy you reading and try to catch furtive glimpses of the text over your shoulder.<br />This is one of my favourite books of all time -- read it and love it too. If I could award it 6 stars, I would.	2001-02-10
US	45887681	R1D60DT9I902EV	006105691X	114801696	Maskerade (Discworld )	Books	3	2	6	N	N	The weakest Pratchett so far	I have to confess that, although I love Pratchett's books and the Discworld generally, I found this the weakest book of the  series. Maybe it's because I'm not an opera buff,  maybe because the story is not a quintessentially Discworld one (apart from the names and histories of the main characters, the story could take place almost anywhere),  maybe because I prefer the Guards to the Witches, or maybe it's just my taste but I just didn't find this as funny or enthralling as his previous books. <br />Pratchett certainly picked up again later and his most recent books are brilliant, but I found the series ebbed a bit here. If, like me, you're reading them all in order (I have, since &quot;Colour of Magic&quot; first came out), then stick with them. If not, make sure you have &quot;Pyramids&quot;, &quot;Small Gods&quot;, &quot;Guards Guards&quot;, &quot;Mort&quot; or &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot; around to read after this one.	2001-02-10
US	45887681	R32LN7EOQWBC3Z	0061059072	199937184	The Last Continent	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Quite a fun read	Being Australian, I was a little worried that non-Australians might not get many of the Aussie-themed jokes and cultural references -- fortunately, this seems not to be the case. (Although, having met Terry at a book-signing for &quot;Last Continent&quot;, he was at pains to find out if I had picked up all of the Oz-references, and was delighted that I had, so he obviously took a great deal of care and did much research for them).<br />Last Continent is an interesting mix of Pratchett's usual style, with slightly more characters and slightly fewer clear plot points than normal. As a result, there is less of a &quot;story&quot; to follow but more fun people and more scope for one-liners. I found it slightly less enjoyable than, say, &quot;Hogfather&quot; (roughly of the order of &quot;Jingo&quot;, which had more of a moral and political tinge to it) but still a very fun read. <br />Readers new to Pratchett should probably read the other Rincewind books (particularly &quot;Colour of Magic&quot; and &quot;Light Fantastic&quot;) to get a feel for the main characters, as knowledge of their personalities adds a great deal to the enjoyment of this book. Reading it cold would probably give a bit of a distorted feel for the series. And remember, if RIncewind is not your bag (baby), there's always the Guards series (my favourite -- try &quot;Small Gods&quot;) or the witches (try &quot;Equal Rites&quot;).	2001-02-10

It's easier to do so when the book itself is brilliant. &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; is a fabulous story, well-told, intelligent, gripping, thrilling and downright disconcerting in parts. It's a compulsive read, one of those books in which you truly spin the pages just to see what lies ahead.<br />The book's use of an antihero (and, wow, what an antihero) is jarring and gives the story a foreboding feel, but is also one of its greatest strengths. You feel caught up in Lecter's mindgames and empathise strongly with Starling.<br />Even if you haven't seen the film, you really should read this book. It is sheer entertainment. Five well-deserved stars.	2001-02-09

I thought this was the best of them, but several of the others (mainly the others in the Lincoln Rhyme series) were also good, solid reads.<br />The first thing you note about Deaver is his precision -- he is a master of the English language and he knows it. (Some of his teaching, almost preachy, asides as to grammar are quite funnily snippy). This makes for distinctive and accurate descriptions, which in turn give the book a great visual feel. The second thing you note is that he loves his plots twists and turns -- his trademark is a number of  *big* shifts in the action (not just one, that'd be too prosaic!). No-one is quite who they seem, and just when you think you know what to expect, the story bucks and shakes and takes off in a wholly different direction. I feel I am pretty good at picking plot direction but Deaver had me stumped almost every time.<br />Overall, this is a really enjoyable novel -- believable characters, great plot and lots of action. Its technical details are overwhelming in their accuracy and comprehensiveness. If you like crime fiction, you have to give this book (and the other Lincoln Rhyme books) a go.	2001-02-04

As always, it is full of twists and turns, and the scenery is well-described and believable. You will be steaming in your seat from the brutally accurate descriptions of the Tar Heel State.<br />The only cons -- I found the characters a little too thin and harder to visualise or empathise with than normal. In a couple of places, this sticks out and jars the reader. This may be because of the literary/philosophical focus on the &quot;empty chair&quot; which underlies the various strata of the story -- it is a more complex book psychologically, and slightly less of an &quot;action&quot; book than its predecessors, which may have detracted from characterisation. (In other books, the characters would walk out right off the page). However, Deaver really spins out more detail on Amelia Sachs' character, which makes for very thought-provoking reading and mostly makes up for the lack of detail on other characters.<br />Typically, for a Deaver novel, you won't quite know whom to root for or what is going to happen next. Just sit back and be taken for a great ride. You should definitely read his first two novels in this series (Bone Collector and Coffin Dancer) before tackling this one, to get the most out of it.	2001-02-04

Although it wasn't as good as his Lincoln Rhyme series, it was still a little page-turner. Deaver has done very well, as the heroine of the story is one of the most unusual in any genres -- a homeless, semi-dysfunctional romantic who works in a video store and survives by squatting in an empty apartment. Her flights of fancy with fairy tales wear a bit thin in places but there is enough fun, suspense and action in the tale to make up for it.<br />As always, the story twists and turns and no-one is who they seem. The ending feels slightly pat but probably explained by this being one of his early works. This book is great if you want to get inside his mind and compare how it has matured and changed  since.<br />Definitely worth a read -- and if you haven't already, go and read the Lincoln Rhyme series. It's up there with Michael Connelly in my opinion.	2001-02-04

That, however, is like saying that a painting is one of Da Vinci's weakest -- the guy is so good that even his earlier, poorer stuff is still worth reading. I found this book fun and gripping, but it has the same flaws (hard to empathise with the characters enough to really get into the story) as his other earlier work. <br />This is quite fast-paced (not as fast as his later work) and quite chilling in parts. He really knows how to get inside peoples' heads, particularly loonies, and describe their thought processes scarily well. Good for a rainy day or when you're sick at home, once you've read all of his others.	2001-02-04

He handles the inner dialogue and thought processes of his villains so well that you feel almost voyeuristic about their twisted, bent world. <br />This book spawned the incredible Silence of the Lambs, and it shares many of the same elements. Eery, dark, foreboding scenes. Chilling evil barely hidden behind the banality of everyday life. Courageous investigators who are not &quot;superhumans&quot; but mortals, with whom the reader can identify.<br />&quot;Red Dragon&quot; is captivating, a real page-turner of a book. Four and a half stars.	2001-02-04

In it, Deaver simultaneously creates a sub-genre (master criminalist as detective), introduces some terrific and unique characters and sets up a wickedly exciting chase, full of suspense.<br />On the technical side, this book really shows up writers like Patricia Cornwell. It's obvious that Deaver has done a tremendous amount of homework and you come away feeling like you've just completed a NYPD forensics course. On the character side, Deaver has created as enjoyable and interesting pair of investigators as anyone. You feel like you could reach out and shake their hands.<br />But it is on the plot side that Deaver shines most. His style can only be described as wrenching -- just as you think you know where the book is going to go, it turns and runs full-tilt in a completely unexpected direction. The book is full of surprises and suspense -- you can feel your palms dripping in a couple of the scenes.<br />Grab this book and read the next two, they are just great.	2001-02-04
US	45887681	R2E0XXP1VGTR65	0684871262	791325639	Speaking in Tongues : A Novel	Books	3	3	4	N	N	A good, pulp novel	Deaver is an excellent author and his recent work is superb. &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot; is one of his earlier works. As such, it shares many of his later trademarks (fast-paced, plot twists and bucks, full of suspense) but is also a little less mature. I found the characters a bit flat and the book hard to get into, though still enthralling -- so you keep flipping through the pages, waiting to see what happens, but not registering that much connection with the story.<br />Overall, it's better than any recent Grisham book and still a good read, though I'd shelve it in favour of a Michael Connelly or one of Deaver's more recent works. It's worth a read if you really like his later work or want something to while away the time while travelling.	2001-02-04
US	45887681	R44IVN538EWAE	0671038443	79347454	The Devil's Teardrop	Books	3	1	1	N	N	A good fun read	Jeffrey Deaver is a very good writer who can usually be counted on for a fun read. This book is no exception. Although it doesn't display the brilliance of his Lincoln Rhyme books, this is a solid and quite well-plotted story. It's a fun, easy read, good for an aeroplane or bus ride (I read it going from Oxford to Cambridge in England, where it made a horrible 3.5 hr ride bearable, but that is a longer story ;-)<br />Only two minor criticisms: It contains the usual Deaveresque plot twists, revelations &amp; surprise turns, but is a little too easily-guessed -- my guess is that the formula is wearing a bit thin, so that those who have read all of his other works know what sort of thing to expect. (This obviously won't apply to new readers.) Secondly, Deaver's main characters tend to be a little too omnipotent &amp; powerful -- this is evident here, in both heroes &amp; villains. I tend to find his stories more engaging when you know that neither a good nor bad guy can simply waltz out of a problem situation.<br />Three and a half stars.	2001-02-04

The editing is tighter, the focus more detailed and the pace faster. Still, the writing remains accessible to kids, as it is simple, economical and visual.<br />Rowling's imagination is first-rate, literally conjuring up all sorts of magical creatures and aptly-named people (each with their own personality). She also creates some delightful plays on words, particularly in her use of Latin morsels of words for spell names.<br />&quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; is not just longer than previous instalments but is more serious (dealing with themes of love, death, friendship and betrayal), darker (with more liberal and graphic violence, particularly towards the end), and sinister (evil on the upsurge; no simple &quot;good wins&quot; ending). It is much like the &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot;, a darker, more intricate and more severe part of the series that fills out the backstory and provides many new plot twists. The next few books promise much.	2001-01-27
US	45887681	R2Z2W73IZN4VYI	0446606243	58879561	The Tenth Justice	Books	4	15	17	N	N	I enjoyed this	&quot;The Tenth Justice&quot; is a very good first book. The pros: Meltzer weaves an interesting and reasonably believable plot from an inspired premise. His characterisation and dialogue are very good, and he has a fantastic sense of humour. Some of the exchanges and one-liners will make you laugh out loud. Most importantly -- he knows what he's writing about, and this comes through clearly.<br />The cons: There are a few major twists and turns that stretch credulity (unfortunately, they can't be mentioned without spoiling the book). In parts, the editing has been scrappy: some of the dialogue gets repetitious and bits could have been cut. If you are a legal insider, you'd know that the first rule of being a Justice's clerk makes parts of the book's premise a little unlikely -- but Meltzer knows enough real-life law to work around this. And the hero tends to be a little too super-human -- a flaw Meltzer shares with Grisham. <br />However, these criticisms are more snipey than structural. All in all, the book is an excellent first effort and is well worth reading. It's much better than Grisham's recent offerings.	2001-01-27
US	45887681	R3KXPQNIM3V6VI	0439136350	667539744	Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A jolly, rollicking read	You really have to like Rowlings' style: although she nominally aims at a young audience, it's easy to see why she appeals to an older folks too. She has a great imagination and dreams up interesting, realistic characters, and describes them so well that you feel you could reach out and touch them. What you don't always realise is that her descriptions are very economical: short and succinct. Her descriptive style is vivid and very visual, almost willing you to create a mental picture of what is transpiring. Her insights into people, their motivations, descriptions and mannerisms are acute and accurate. Rowling also has a great feel for words, and her puns and names are usually delicious.<br />&quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; has all of this and more. The sheer fun of the writing hides the fact that the book is actually extremely skilfully plotted, better and tighter than most adult fare. It also hides the fact that there is some serious grown up vocabulary and grammer; it all fits together so well and is so accessible that the craft is unnoticeable. I have to admit that I was expecting a lower standard when I started the series, thinking nothing this hyped could be that good. But it is, especially this book. I hope it gets more kids to read.	2001-01-22

These are great discoveries that are to be savoured: I get a shiver and my heart races with excitement each time it happens. The book cries out to be read slowly and enjoyed, but you just want to rip through it to see how it ends. Then you read the book again and again, just for the sheer enjoyment. &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; was one such book; &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; another. &quot;The Black Echo&quot; is a third. Michael Connelly's debut effort has to be one of the very best books I have ever read, and certainly one of the best detective fiction books out there.<br />Connelly has an excellent eye for describing real life: his scenes are gritty and intoxicatingly detailed and his ear for dialogue is superb. His characters are memorable; writing with the benefit of hindsight, the Harry Bosch series has proved to be a modern classic. The old adage is &quot;write what you know about&quot;. Connelly knows crime (he was a newspaper crime reporter) and he knows LA; like the back of his hand. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story. Stick through his next, &quot;The Black Ice&quot;, which is very good but not as good as this, and then move into &quot;Concrete Blonde&quot; and &quot;The Last Coyote&quot;, which are also superb.	2001-01-20

Having acquired an expertise in identifying the authors of texts, whether anonymous or wrongly-attributed, he has turned into a sort of one-stop expert for tracking them down. The story is a vivid and entertaining account of how he acquired that skill and some of the academic, civil and criminal cases -- some, high profile -- in which he has since used it.<br />There's nothing worse than a &quot;I know how to do it&quot; book whose author doesn't actually tell the reader how he does it. Thankfully, Foster reveals enough tidbits -- banal on their own, but collectively incredible -- to get a good feel for his scientific, forensic method.<br />My only gripe is that the introduction, particularly, and scattered parts of the text display a teasing attitude (&quot;I've done this but I can't tell you about it ... yet) in respect of certain cases (such as the JonBenet Ramsay case). It would be better to state this in one sentence and not harp on it -- but to save it for a later book. Still, a fascinating read.	2001-01-14

It sets the pattern for the remainder of her work to date (Jan 2001): flimsy plots, poor/non-existent characterisation, awful dialogue and plain bad writing. The first two Scarpetta books showed signs of planning, thought, research and effort. None has since. This is dashed-off tosh, written too quickly with an eye on the bank balance and not on the story. Holes abound and description is poor. The pacing is usually glacial but then, just when it matters, too quick. It is not plausible as a thriller or mystery as the culprit is obvious from the get-go. Skip this and pick up Michael Connelly or John Connolly.	2001-01-13

After that, each book has gotten successively worse, roughly linearly, except for this one. &quot;The Street Lawyer&quot; was terrible; &quot;The Brethren&quot; just barely passes muster. It's not that it is unrealistic -- I work in a court and can suspend disbelief for most legal books (which, unfortunately, is invariably necessary) -- but that it is plain &amp; simple a bad read. No real plot to speak of. No characters to which to become attached. No empathy with the story at all, in fact. Stale ideas, stale prose, awkwardly plotted and badly told. Skip this one unless you have absolutely nothing better to do; go back and read a much earlier Grisham or try Brad Meltzer's &quot;The Tenth Justice&quot;. Or go for a brisk walk; anything.	2001-01-13

Thankfully, it tends to have escaped the notice and zeal of restitution lawyers, perhaps because its nature is too equitable to be understood or re-explained in common law terms. <br />In this book, the final product of an Oxford DPhil thesis, Spence has gone back to roots of equitable estoppel and sought to tease out its subtleties. He has succeeded in demonstrating that equity, by use of estoppel, seeks to protect a party's reliance loss at the hands of another. Spence reconciles this with, and explains why, the relief ordered may range from the nominal to a full expectation loss. He also offers useful guidance as to possible future directions of the law. &quot;Protecting Reliance&quot; is a thoughtful book and a good work of scholarship.<br />The only pity is that this book was -- just -- too early to include Giumelli. It is an essential text for academics and practitioners.	2001-01-13

Cornwell finds her feet and dashes out a good story, one that is evidently well thought-out. This and her next are very readable. Take a chance on her third (a silly, shallow plot) and pass on all the rest. The later books magnify the faults in this to the point of overwhelming all else -- evident narcissism and confused sexuality (have you read her true-life escapades? more interesting than her fiction, but I digress) and a fascination with the seamier side of life that becomes distressingly morbid and dank to the point of nihilism. I stopped buying her books and borrowed them only from a library, unwilling to finance her vanity, hoping all the while that Cornwell might have regained her feet. She hasn't yet. Somewhere in all of this some good characters slipped through the cracks. A pity.	2001-01-13

It hasn't started up again. The plot-line has become glacially slow and RJ only seems interested in: (a) drawing out the nuances of the tiniest of inter-personal relationships between his main good characters that NO-ONE cares about (braid-tug, sniff etc); (b) creating new characters no-one will ever remember; (c) forgetting about those existing characters that one does recall (hello, RJ, there's one called Mat); (d) laughing up his sleeve at fans puzzling to work out the Adeleas/Asmodean/Demandred threads that have been happening for, oh, 3-4 books now &amp; badly need to be cleared up. And only spiced up at the end after the publishers realised that nothing had happened in the book. I'm waiting for someone to write a 100 page summary of books 7-9. Shouldn't take long.	2001-01-07

Martin is a gifted storyteller with a fabulous imagination, great flair (particularly for capturing dialogue) and a very, very good sense of humour. This trilogy is easily the best SFF series out there and each book is a contender for the best SFF book too. If anything, the books just keep getting better. Brilliant, vast, epic, original, breathtaking, quirky -- yet very humorous in parts. [Robert Jordan should sit down, read this series, compare his own work to it and re-think his game plan]. If you fail to like this book I'd be very surprised.	2001-01-07

The book is full of contrivances that serve to keep the action becoming derailed but they ring very hollow. Lots of cliches; lots of impossible escapes. In a few scenes, you skip ahead because what you are reading is just so embarrassingly awful. Reilly can't write and is trying to turn an overambitious screenplay into a book and, ultimately, a movie. Just not fun. Skip this and his others; try Clancy or Coontz or Patrick Robinson instead.	2001-01-07
