It's an epic that borrows more than a little bit from LORD OF THE RINGS, but the differences are more interesting than the similarities. <br /> <br />Of course, there's a mismatched band of heroes on a quest, with the threat of impending war hanging over everyone's heads. But even as the stakes are raised to colassal proportions, author Ryo Mizuno manages to keep the focus on the characters, instead of generic armies going into endless generic battles. It was a good choice to make, because in that regard I found GREY WITCH to be far more enjoyable than the 3rd Rings movie, RETURN OF THE KING. <br /> <br />The artwork is awesome, very American comics influenced. The dialogue is crisp and to the point, and the overall narrative is straightforward. <br /> <br />If you're only going to read one LODOSS manga, I'd recommend GREY WITCH.	2005-08-29

Think DR. WHO with boobs! <br /> <br />Every story features lots of sexy outfits, or sexy outfits falling off of our heroine as she meets all kinds of historic figures.  Although it's kind of risque at parts, overall it's all in good fun and there's certainly nothing hardcore or offensive about it. <br /> <br />Ultimately TIME TRAVELER AI is a good fun read, suitable for fans of HEAVY METAL comics. <br />	2005-08-29

SEXY PIRATES is pretty rambunctuous throughout, although there's not quite as many bouncing boobs as in Book 1. <br /> <br />Regardless, this is a very fun title and a quick read.

So this hybrid of American-style storytelling with insets by the original Japanese artist (Koichi Ohata, for those of you who DON'T already know!) was something truly original. <br /> <br />The action is virtually non-stop, and the art is crisp. There are some great scenes of violence, and a bodacious chick as well.  <br /> <br />However, the REAL treat is in the bonus materials in the back of the book, chock full of Koichi Ohata's original concept drawings. You hardly ever see this stuff in manga titles, so this was a real treat. <br /> <br />Worth checking out , especially if you're a fan of Marvel & DC comics.	2005-08-19

Heroic knights Spark and Parn battle to free those on the shore near Marmo, while the other members of the cast, scattered about Lodoss and having various related adventures, really give the story the epic sense of scope that one of these fantasy tales needs to be successful. <br /> <br />As you might expect in the penultimate chapter, there is a lot of wrap-up of plot threads from Books 1-4, plus a bit of set-up for the conclusion in Book 6, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it keeps things moving right along, and I felt a sense of impending doom as things became more bleak for our heroes. <br /> <br />A few other notes: The bonus pages with character profiles & such were very well designed, and served as a quick primer to get the uninitiated up to speed.  The cover design is eerie, kinda sombre, which fits the mood of this part of the story. Also, the artwork prints nice & clear throughout the whole book. <br /> <br />A good, fun read.	2005-08-08

As such, Book 4 really turns up the heat! <br /> <br />Jiba the Dark Elf has claws reminiscent of Marvel's Wolverine character, and is just as adept at using them. The story really picks up as Spark begin to lose his confidence after suffering a few brutal defeats in a row. Fortunately, he's more like his old self again by the end of the book, which is exactly what he needs to do if he's ever going to rescue Neece from Jiba's grimy clutches.   <br /> <br />The Leif character also has a larger role to play in this book as Spark's guide, and he also serves as the comic relief.  However there's still the question of where the other characters of Spark's entourage have gone after their disastrous shipwreck in Book 3.   Another added bonus are cameo appearances by Lodoss mainstays Parn the Free Knight and King Kashu! <br /> <br />This is a great title to check out, regardless of whether or not you've sat through the entire anime. It has action, comedy, and tremendous art. Recommended!	2005-08-08

From the first page of the first volume, I've been engrossed with the mythology & characters of Lodoss Island, and now that things were coming to an end, I was kinda sad. <br /> <br />But what a way to go! This volume is basically an extended battle, and some of our favorite characters don't make it to the last page of the book. (I won't spoil it for you, though!)  Each of the main characters gets at least one moment to shine, which is certainly fitting as we wrap things up with such broad, sweeping strokes. <br /> <br />This volume is huge...over 250 pages, which again gives this last adventure a special feeling. I felt like this was the end of some biblical epic like Ben Hur, or Tolkien's Rings saga...that's how dynamic and explosive the entire world author Ryo Mizuno has created. <br /> <br />Of course, there are certain things that MUST happen in all fantasy tales, however, Mr. Mizuno always manages to put a new twist on even the most familiar of fantasy archetypes, keeping them fresh and inventive. <br /> <br />If you haven't read this series, I suggest you get all six volumes and wait for a rainy day. Get under a thick blanket, a cup of hot tea by your side, and savor all 1200 pages of this amazing fantasy epic in one sitting. <br /> <br />Lodoss War is VERY recommended!	2005-08-08

This second volume of DEEDLIT'S TALE really picks up the pace, now that all of the set-up has been gotten out of the way. <br /> <br />We pick up in the middle of the story, things are really dangerous, and on top of everything else, Deedlit has the pesty elf Estas vying for her romantic affections while she's trying to rescue her lover, Parn the Free Knight.  Throw in the invading hordes of the Marmo army and a whole bunch of helpless refugees making a mass exodus through the eerie Forest of No Return, and you've got the makings of a fantasy epic. <br /> <br />However, with all of this heavy, somber stuff going on, DEEDLIT'S TALE remains primarily a story about our lead character...Deedlit...and how she must overcome these seemingly insurmountable obstacles.  This volume is a terrific blend of mysticism, romance, and epic fantasy all spun together into a compelling narrative.  <br /> <br />Sure, the subtext about  prejudice (The Elfs don't like the Humans, and vice versa) is a little heavy handed at times, but this is a fantasy book, after all, not a sociology text.  However, props up to the author Ryo Mizuno for trying to get his point across, as the parable really can be applied to practically anyone.   <br /> <br />There was also the flashback of when Deedlit first set out to leave the Forest of No Return. This was the meat & potatoes of the book for me, as I'd been wondering for years about Deedlit's \\"secret\\" origin. <br /> <br />Last word: Pick up Book 1 first, then slam through this one.  They're both good, quick reads that you'll revisit...and enjoy...over and over again.	2005-08-02

However, once I got past that, I was actually drawn into the story. <br /> <br />DEEDLIT'S TALE is the classic fantasy archetype, wonderfully melded with the romantic overtones that you'd expect to find in Shoujo-fare.  Parn loves Deedlit. She loves Parn. But her old flame from the Elfen World, a troublemaker named Estas, is trying to split up our lovers so he can have Deed all to himself.  Of course, we have to have evil villains, and a quest to flesh things out.  <br /> <br />The artwork is much different in this Lodoss War series than in other books. DEEDLIT'S TALE is presented in a much softer style than GREY WITCH or LADY OF PHARIS, but considering this one is really aimed at a female audience I didn't have an issue with that. <br /> <br />Ultimately, it was nice to see Deedlit on her own for a while, outside of the gigantic LODOSS mythology.  We get to really know how she thinks and why she chose to go outside the Forest of No Return in the first place. <br /> <br />If you haven't read the first Lodoss series (Grey Witch), DEEDLIT'S TALE will still stand on it's own, whether you're a LODOSS expert or a novice.	2005-08-02

And, although this particular volume has its serious moments, the humor, when it finally does poke it's head out like a turtle, explodes off the page! <br /> <br />And don't get thrown by the subtle use of  flashbacks and flashforwards, either ... just hold on for the ride, especially since the jokes usually pay off rather well.  Best of all, the humor generally springs directly from the plot or characters, and isn't just shoe-horned in for a cheap laff. <br /> <br />What can I say? If you liked the anime, you'll probably groove on the manga.  <br />	2005-08-02

However, the drama works on a personal level at the same time planets are exploding.  It's a tricky task to pull off, but Asamiya does so with charm. <br /> <br />Very recommended! <br />	2005-07-29

If you don't think this is going to end in anything other than a catfight, you aren't familiar with Midnight Panther! <br /> <br />The most compelling thing about the Panther series is the way it exudes such quiet sensuality. Unlike the straight-forward nudie pin-ups of Satoshi Urushihara, You Asagiri's art conveys a subtle sexiness that hits you between the eyes as opposed to between the...well, you know where I'm going. <br /> <br />Once again, You Asagiri's artwork is the real star, and you'll find yourself flipping through the pages to admire the art again and again.	2005-07-29

As such, NADESICO is a pretty easy manga to pick up, read, and absorb. And hey, comics should be fun to read, right? <br /> <br />In NADESICO 4, the epic conclusion of this space adventure, things comes to a close with an eerie ending that effects each of the major characters in the piece.  Stakes are raised for each cast member, and the fate of the world...plus their very lives...all depends on how thier combined decisions will weave together into the ultimate outcome. <br /> <br />Sounds like heady stuff, I know, but it's actually quite fun, and an easy read at that.  Of course, I have to mention the art, which is a terrifiic blend of the usual manga-mecha stuff, a few buxom babes, and the classic Asamiya heroic archetypes. <br /> <br />Ultimately, NADESICO is a great manga to start with if you're a longtime comics fan but you've never  given manga a try.	2005-07-29

Not only that, but author/artist You Asagiri  expands the storyline and characters into a whole new area that you wouldn't expect. <br /> <br />While we, the readers, already know about a few of the characters' background we've yet to see Sonya's real background-and that is what we're finally treated to in Midnight Panther 4.   <br /> <br />There's a short story in the beginning taken place what appears to be feudal Japan, and we get to know about Sonya and what type of man she's attracted to.  The second half of the book we get to understand her past a bit better. The end was well put together as it ties everything up without a lot of loopholes. <br /> <br />All in all, this may have been my favorite of the 4 Panther volumes.	2005-07-28

JOE, one of my all-time favorites. So I felt compelled to give this book a second look, and I'm glad that I did. <br /> <br />VOTOMS is jam-packed with action, mecha battles and stuff blowing up. The characters are rather hard edged, and you get a sense that the stakes they're fighting for are pretty high.  <br /> <br />The art is done in a more American style than an actual manga, and the full-color print job keeps everything looking slick. It'd be interesting to see an actual manga version of this story. <br /> <br />However, the real treat for me was the bonus materials, which offered some interesting insights into the history of the anime show, the characters, and their world.	2005-07-28

I wasn't disappointed!    Our heroine, the nubile vixen Lemnear, is on the usual fantasy quest, seeking revenge/validation/self-awareness, etc. She meets a variety of travelling companions and dukes it out with a number of bad guys.  Best of all, her flimsy barbarian-wench costume is reduced to tatters early on, so she appears topless for the majority of this volume...EXCELLENT!    Its the abundance of nudity (nothing extreme, though...(...)) that earned this book the mature rating, but the overall fantasy storyline isn't adult in nature.  The narrative is crisp and chugs right along, never lingering too long on any one point.    Of course, the best selling point about this book is Urishihara's artwork...dynamic and incredible in every way.  If you're a fan of HEAVY METAL magazine, then you should give LEMNEAR a try.	2005-07-28

It was quite interesting to read how Funk would have to separate himself between the two sides of the business whenever he had to make a difficult decision. He also goes into detail about his many retirement matches, and how his love for the business makes it hard for him to stay away from it for very long. <br /> <br />The road stories of travelling with Dick Murdoch, Dusty Rhodes and Mick Foley are fantastic, and well worth the price of admission. Best of all, the co-writer really captures Funk's unique diction, so it feels as if he's telling these tall tales over a beer rather than in a 200-something page book. <br /> <br />One particularly nice thing about this book is that Funk doesn't spend whole chapters knocking other talents, as has been the vogue lately. Generally, he focuses on the positive side of his peers, and stays away from overly criticizing other wrestlers. It's a nice change of pace after the controversy surrounding the Mick Foley, Bret Hart and Ric Flair squabbles from 2004 surrounding Flair's WWE book. <br /> <br />Ultimately, I've yet to read a wrestling book that tops Mick Foley's HAVE A NICE DAY, but I'd put MORE THAN JUST HARDCORE very near the top of my \\"Best\\" list.	2005-07-28

From a woman who can turn into a cheetah, to a woman with a sword, and a woman who simply strangles people with her hair.  And it just so happens they are a pop idle group by day and assasins by night. However all these girls have a past behind them which carries good plot development. <br /> <br />Like a lot of fantasy stuff, you can't take the plot too seriously, but the light-hearted tone that the characters' personalities exhibit keep the otherwise morbid storyline moving quickly, which more than makes up for any logical gaps. Plus, there are quite a few comedic moments (that I won't spoil for you)! <br /> <br />Ultimately, the artwork is really the star in this volume, and Ms. Asagiri's renderings of the women are quietly haunting.

This is a pretty fast-paced volume with an extended fight scene in which the heroine's clothes are reduced to shreds when she uses her explosive telekinetic powers...OOOPS! <br /> <br />Things calm down a bit once our heroes return home to Japan, and it's mostly set-up for the next series of erotic adventures which feature a busty new professor who takes a shine to our lead character. <br /> <br />All in all, MAXION is light-hearted and fun, with plenty of hot chicks to keep you turning the pages.	2005-07-21

With that said, it's easy to see why NAMBUL 1 reads like the intro to an overall greater work, because it is. <br /> <br />NAMBUL is the tale of a (semi) ficticious war between Japan and Korea, and although it isn't set in any definite time period, it certainly echoes many of today's global issues...particularly issues surrounding fossil fuels and what oil-hungry nations will do to procure them.   <br /> <br />While it is based on various historical turning points, it creates its own war-like atmosphere from a civilian point of view.  The characters hold very distinctive personalities and some with strong views on nationalism, which will draw you into the story.  As we get to know them better, they become more realistic, and as the entire plot plays out we see how the story works simultaneously on a personal level and on a global scale.  <br /> <br />As always, the artwork by Mr. Lee is fantastic.	2005-07-13

I loved the Geobreeders anime because LOTS of stuff blows up and the chicks are all well-endowed and jiggly, so I had high hopes for the manga. Although you can't actually SEE the girls jiggling, the art is still top-notch. <br /> <br />For lovers of Tenchi Muyo you have to check out Geobreeders, which follows poor Yoichi Taba, a regular guy who simply wants agood paying  job.   When he's hired by the bizarre Kagura Security, he has no idea what he's getting into. Taba, like the readers, is in for an extremely outrageous plot  and insanely cute girls. <br /> <br />Y'see, Kagura hunts down the Phantom Cats (bizarre otherworldly shape-shifters) with high-tech devices that lock them on a computer disc...sorta like they did in GHOSTBUSTERS.   This story is one of those insane comedies where you want to laugh and stay confused.    <br /> <br />Though majority of the characters are girls who seem a bit off, they know what they're doing-even if their methods are a bit extreme.  The action scenes in particular are more like what you'd expect to find in a big Hollywood movie than in a manga.  <br /> <br />All in all, an excellent story if you want to veg. <br /> <br />	2005-07-12

This book is interesting as it is a compilation of a bunch of Korean myths that seem to all fit together, as well as including plenty of archetypes from Western culture.<br /><br />Like many of Mr. Lee's works, the total story runs in multi-volume arcs, so much of this first tome is set-up for the apocalypse to come.  Still, there's much entertainment to found, especially if you like murderous primatives, nude buxom heroines, and fantastic illustrations of wild animals.<br /><br />Book 1 revolves around a man who would do anything to become the ruler of the land, and the unholy price he'll have to apy to acheive it.  There's loads of symbolism, way too much to get into here, and it's all very shocking and intriguing.<br /><br />The artwork is simply stunning with all the detail in shadow and figures.  And although well over 300 pages, Mythology is a quick read,  as the illustrations tell most of the story.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-07-12

Reading this one will have mixed emotions whether to be angry at the characters or sympathize them, which just goes to show the complexity of Mr. Lee's storytelling and characterizations.    <br /> <br />Overall you will not be disappointed. <br />	2005-07-12

We get to know more about Ha's past and why she became a cop in the first place.  The third story combines the humor of the 1st story and the  dark creepiness of the second.  It's all very tragic, and yet there is a very strong pro-feminist message throughout all of the work, which I found very, very interesting. <br /> <br />This book continues to be action-packed with suspenseful adventure and definitely a must read.	2005-07-11

This is an amazing book with just the right amount of dialogue, and if you've seen any other books by Hyun se Lee, you'll know that his pictures speak louder than words.   <br /> <br />Although the entire book revolves around the lady cop, the individual chapters are like little, self-contained detective stories.
