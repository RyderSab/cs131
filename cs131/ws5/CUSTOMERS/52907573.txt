We follow the life of Rosa, who is a master cook growing up on a prosperous Sicilian farm.  At 18, her lover is murdered and Rosa in her grief cooks and cooks.  Her first person account of this is absolutely hilarious.  Eventually, Rosa goes to Palermo and becomes a staid librarian for a quarter century.  Then an English gentleman and chef comes to the library to do research and both he and Rosa are smitten.  Their following affair is really something to read--spicy but not lurid.  Throughout the story, author, Lily Prior, throws in some magical realism that ups the pleasure of this yummy read.  Recommended for when you want something fun but not flat and ordinary.	2005-07-19

As a left wing Christian, Lamott understandably has trouble with the war and George W. Bush.  As if that weren't enough, she is also turning 50 and her son is becoming a teenager.  Lamott writes of all these things with great candor and humor.  She is breathtakingly honest, but not in a way that makes me cringe or think \\"too much information.\\"  She also writes of friends and loved ones with great affection and compassion that manages to avoid sentimentality.  Lamott has the ability to be very funny and very wise at the same time, which is always a pleasure.  As a person who more and more searches for straight forward honesty, I find Anne Lamott a welcome breath of fresh air.  I highly recommend this book.	2005-03-08

I read it in a day while home with a cold.  The dialog is glib and sometimes witty and things sail along pretty well, but there are some aspects that leave one feeling flat when all is said and done.  I finished the book, with a \\"that's it?\\" feeling.   <br /> <br />The transposition of the Pride and Prejudice plot and characters to 20th century Yorkshire worked for me.  The Bennet contingent consists of the town locals, and the Darcy/Bingley group are the film company and cast who are in town to shoot the outdoor location shots for a television remake of P&P. Kate Fenton  reverses the sexes of all the major characters.  This worked for some but not for others.  Mr. and Mrs. Bennet become the owners of the pub in the Yorkshire town.  Bernard is behind the bar, not too swift, sometimes annoying, and lacking in tact.  Sarah his wife runs the attached restaurant which serves gourmet, not pub, food.  She is very sharp and isn't above making fun of her husband.  I had no problem with them, nor with the Bingley sisters becoming the two lead actors in the film.  Caroline Bingley's character becoming a narcissistic actor who thinks no one is as clever or attractive as he is, is quite good.  Even Charles Bingley becoming Candia, the beautiful, flighty, but good tempered lead actress of the film was a successful switch.   <br /> <br />The Darcy-Elizabeth reversals were a problem.  Darcy becomes Mary, the film's director, and Elizabeth is Nick, a critically acclaimed, but not best-selling, novelist.  Fenton tries to swing the Darcy pride onto Mary while keeping her likable enough to accept as the hero, and I didn't buy it.  Mary is driven as a director for her art by her ambition, and that is why she treats people like dirt, but yet that's OK because it was for her art.  Well, it wasn't OK; she was just a pain, and not even an interesting pain; nor does she ever see the light and mend her ways as Austen did to Darcy.  Nick, could have been a genius in the newspaper biz, but he left for a more relaxed life as an author.  He's funny and sharp-witted, but but basically just wants to drink with his mates and write enough to stay afloat.  How Mary and Nick are ever supposed to be interested in each other as a couple I could never figure out.  There's no chemistry, I mean zero chemistry, between them.  And therein lay the fatal flaw of the book for me.  Fenton's writing was fine, her minor characterizations were fun, and the Charles Bingley/Jane romance worked in Fenton's hands, but the Elizabeth/Darcy romance was a bust.	2005-02-11

Leon is a very good writer, and she has made an admirable character in Brunetti, but this is not a typical mystery novel of the \\"whodunit\\" variety.   <br /> <br />The story centers upon the newly discovered body of a young nobleman who was kidnapped two years previously.  After two ransom demands, the kidnappers made no further contacts with the young man's family, and so the case remained a mystery.  Now with the body discovered buried on a rural farm, Brunetti of the Venice police department, reopens the case as a murder investigation.   <br /> <br />Other than Brunetti and his family, most of the characters were not very interesting.  What did hold my interest was the life and attitudes of the Venetians and how the European world of commerce works with the opening of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Bloc.  The murder case was rather secondary to the actual story of the young man's family's business and not much of a puzzle.  Leon's strength as a writer is to make the reader really see the story through Brunetti's eyes, which is no small feat, especially when she uses third person narration.  I just wish she could give Brunetti a more complex mystery to unravel.	2005-02-04

It is as enjoyable as the first two of the series (How to Murder a Millionaire and Dead Girls Don't Wear Diamonds).  I read the entire book in an evening, as it reads very fast and is difficult to put down.  Nora Blackbird, the middle sister and narrator of the story, is an engaging amateur sleuth.  A former socialite fallen on hard times, she now works as a society page reporter for a Philadelphia newspaper.   <br /> <br />In Some Like it Lethal, the holiday season is just starting with the Hunt Breakfast, which Nora attends in order to cover it for the paper.  While there, the body of Rush Strawcutter is found bludgeoned to death in one of the horse stalls along with Emma Blackbird, Nora's younger sister, who has been beaten and is nearly dead from alcohol poisoning.  The police finger Emma as the murderer, and that leaves Nora to find out the truth.  A subplot of a blackmailing scam comes to the surface, which Nora also needs to deal with.  <br /> <br />Nancy Martin writes great dialog for her characters and the plot moves along well.  I was able to figure out who the blackmailer was early on, but how everything intertwined and came together in the end, I was not able to discover in advance. <br /> <br />Nora is a delight to spend time with and it is easy to see why Michael Abruzzo is back in this third story to woo and court her.  Nora is a young widow whose first marriage ended in tragedy when her doctor husband became a cocaine addict and was shot to death.  Therefore, Nora is wary about the whole dating scene, and Michael's family's association with organized crime (he claims he has nothing to do with them) adds to her concern.  On the other hand, Michael is very considerate of Nora and she finds him very sexy.  Some Like it Lethal continues their story with some surprises. <br /> <br />The addition of Spike, a very small dog of extremely murky heritage, provides for some great fun and dialog, as does Libby Blackbird, the eldest sister, who is embracing her inner goddess after the recent birth of her fifth child. <br /> <br />If you are new to the Blackbird Sister mysteries, Some Like it Lethal, can be read on its own.  Martin gives enough background for everything to make sense; however, for full enjoyment of all the characters and situations, I recommend reading the first two books of the series.  They are all worth the read.	2005-02-04

Judge Dee is an actual historical person, a magistrate of the seventh century during the T'ang dynasty, who was renown in China for his ability to solve crimes.  In Judge Dee at Work, van Gulik presents us with eight short stories each of a single case (the novels, in the Chinese tradition, involve 3 intertwined cases) that take place throughout the judge's long career (magistrates were usually moved to a new post every three years).  A table at the back of the book, places each case and all the novels within the timeline of Judge Dee's life.<br /><br />I have read about half the novels and this book of short stories, and I have enjoyed them all.  Early on, Judge Dee employs three different men to be his lieutenants, and they do much of the legwork for him.  However, Dee is also very hands-on, going to the crime scenes and sometimes even going about in disguise.  In some of the short stories here, he solves the mystery on his own.  van Gulik has created a good detective in Dee; he is very, very smart, fair, compassionate to victims and stern with criminals.  The cases are varied and interesting, and difficult to solve. I especially like the setting of ancient China.  van Gulik really seems to know the era he is writing about, and he brings it alive through the actions and dialog of the story.  There is no exposition here.  If we need to know the differences of Taoism to Buddhism, we find out through a conversation of Dee with a monk or other character.  That really makes the stories glide along.  Sometimes a choice of phrase seems a little odd or modern for the setting, and I assume that arises from the fact that van Gulik was Dutch writing about China in English.  In any event, these quirks become rather fun and don't detract at all from the stories. van Gulik also made illustrations in the traditional Chinese style of the time, and they add to the stories.  I am very glad I have found the Judge Dee mysteries, and Judge Dee at Work is an excellent way to meet the judge and his world.  You will be glad you did.made illustrations in the traditional Chinese style of the time, and they add to the stories.

At a beading retreat held at a summer camp, one of the bead designers ends up murdered.  Since Kitzi had just found out that the designer was having an affair with her best friend's husband, who is also a bead designer at the camp, she sets to work to prove that her friend isn't guilty.  The police think Kitzi is a prime suspect, so she is working on her own, trying to snoop around while not looking guilty herself.  Kitzi is fun to be around, and I enjoyed her first person narration of the story. Smith does give Kitzi a lot of beading info to tell us in exposition rather than character dialog or plot development, which is a slight weakness in the writing.  Kitzi does get the \\"bad guy\\" in the end, but it isn't a classic solving of a whodunit; she more falls into the conclusion. I had suspicions but not certainty of who the murderer was, and I found the killer motive and method believable. Smith didn't \\"cheat\\" and leave out a lot of info; we're told all we need to know to get as far as Kitzi does.  All in all, Bead on Trouble was a fun read, and I look forward to Kitzi's next case.	2005-01-19

Very little happens in this book, far less than the happenings of a real Austen novel, and the book club characters don't even discuss Austen's novels that much.  Fowler can be witty here and there, but her characters are flat or at least flatly written.  We learn ancedotes from their pasts, but it is not clear how these memories have shaped the characters into who they are in the story.  Fowler fails to convey any of the real pain or happiness of the characters; she tells us when they are happy or unhappy, but I certainly didn't feel it.  She writes about the book club members letting Austen into their lives to look around and influence them, but in this I could see no connection between what the members discuss about the books and then what they did in the story.  I was hoping this would be much better.	2005-01-19

He travels on a budget that leads to many interesting scenarios, such as crossing the Atlantic on a cargo ship with a handful of other passengers, that have little to nothing to do with coffee.  Much of his info on the history of coffee in Europe is a recitation (although amusingly told) of more staid histories of coffee.  He spends most of his travels looking for either the best or worst cup of coffee.  After I finished the book, I felt like I had read several good anecdotal stories and legends about the origins and history of coffee, and had also read a rather crazy, but interesting, travelogue that loosely related to the spread of coffee from Africa to the rest of the world.  It was a fun read and worth reading, but I am still looking for a more focused and complete history of coffee.	2004-11-16

One of the qualities of her writing that I most enjoyed is that she expresses her intricate love of nature with a joy that lacks sentimentality.  She spends her time determining what she is seeing and hearing and writes about that rather than looking inward to how she feels about everything.  Therefore, her joy and feeling come through in the words she chooses to describe her subjects, and not in a list of subjective feelings.  For me, that made her poetry universal and a communication that I could share in.  I highly recommend this book for both the poetry and nature lover.	2004-11-16

I found the story very enjoyable.  Darcy's relationships with his male friends and his dog and horse shed light on Darcy and his humanity.  His relationship with his sister, here expressed in letters, shows that the turnaround in his character that Elizabeth provokes in P&P is not far-fetched.  Aidan presents Darcy as a bit of an introvert who has learned how to function in society by using his wealth and prestige as armor, contrary to Elizabeth's impression that he is cold; and it is Elizabeth and his feelings for her that show him the inadequacy of his ways.  However, his first solution is to run away, and that is as far as he gets in this first installment.  Aidan starts at the beginning of P&P, with the Bingley's and Darcy settling in at Netherfield and progresses to their return to London, where Darcy is hoping to forget Elizabeth.  All in all, a well written and fascinating redo of the first third of Pride and Prejudice.	2004-09-01

On working several of the projects, I found the instructions quite clear, and these were the first time I had done brick stitch. Several pluses put this book on a level above many beading books: the history of brick stitch with pictures of traditional uses; the inclusion of single-stack, double-stack and triple-stack brick stitch graph paper to copy; many different photos of each project as made by the author's friends to demonstrate variations; and a well-done gallery for inspiration. I have found that this book has been able to answer all my brick stitch questions so far, and I have found it one of the best books in the beadworks &quot;Beading with&quot; series.	2004-08-03

The book is divided into twelve chapters, one for each month, and takes us through the Mayles adjusting to life in France and getting their old farmhouse renovated.  Mayle writes with self-deprecating wit and genuine pleasure for his new home.  He is clearly bemused and captivated by his new friends.  For example, before the cherry harvest (his land has 30 cherry trees), natives warn him repeatedly of the coming migrant &quot;gypsies&quot; who officially come to harvest the cherries but also have a habit of thievery.  The stories are so overblown, that Mayle can't wait to meet these horrible gypsies; the results are hilarious.  He and his wife also learn to contend with the Mistral, a harsh wind coming from Siberia, which their plumber informs them is getting stronger year by year, which can only mean that somewhere between Provence and Siberia the earth is getting flatter.  In addition to all the home repairs are descriptions of excellent meals in perfect little restaurants around Provence.

He writes of the catastrophe with great verve, and the book becomes quite a page-turner.  From there he moves forward through time to the present showing the changes in climate and habitat, and then how the advent of humans in North America impacted its ecology.  I grew up in Wisconsin, and I had no idea what a distinct climate and ecology the central portion of North America has compared to the other continents.  Because the major mountain ranges (Sierra Nevada, Rockies and Appalachians) run from north to south compared to east to west (the Alps, Urals and Himalayas), North America has a &quot;climatic trumpet&quot; where hot air comes up from the equator in the summer producing near tropical summers even in Wisconsin, and then cold air comes down from the arctic in winter producing a sub-arctic winter.  I hadn't realized that Europe and Asia don't have areas with such major swings in temperature as the norm.  Flannery also explains how this trumpet will cause global warning or an ice age to be most severe in North America compared to the other continents.  Flannery presents and explores in the latter portion of his book many theses on how he thinks North Americans need to take care of their continent so that life as we know it is not jeopardized.  Many may think his predictions more dire than need be, but all are worth some careful thought, and many are new ideas (such as the need for large carnivores) that most people would not have thought of.  All in all, The Eternal Frontier is a thoughtful, well-written and surprisingly exciting book.	2004-04-14

I had heard they were very different, and they are.  The movie has turned her memoirs into a narrative and taken several liberties with her life and friends, but I must admit that I enjoyed both.  The book is a memoir and not a novel, and it mainly covers the purchase and renovation of an old villa near Cortona that Mayes purchased.  Much of the charm and &quot;action&quot; of the book is how Mayes learns to do things the Tuscan way, inevitably by trial and error.  Her delight in Tuscany and the people of Cortona make it easy to see why she was so accepted by the people.  Mayes writes with warmth and a poetic sense of the sites, sounds, tastes and customs of Tuscany.  This is a great book to curl up with and while away an afternoon.	2004-04-09

Tagore, a Bengali Hindu, writes with great beauty, emotion and simplicity.  Reading the poems in order (there are 157 poems, each about a page or less long) shows the waxing and waning cycles of Tagore's spiritual life.  Sometimes God is present to Tagore, only to leave later.  A Christian spiritual seeker myself, I could easily relate to the pendulum swing that Tagore writes about: the joys, frustrations and patience.  Tagore himself made an English translation of these poems for which he won the Nobel prize for literature in the early 20th century (the first non-European to win the literature prize).  Here the translation is by a Catholic monk who spent most of his adult life in Bengal, and many scholars think his translation is better than Tagore's, due to his absolute fluency in both languages.  I have read beautiful poems by many spiritual writers, and I found Tagore's Gitanjali the most approachable and meaningful.  Highest recommendation.	2004-04-09

First, Bruteau discusses the concepts of leisure and silence (they are not what we normally think!) as necessary attributes for meditation.  In her chapter describing meditation itself, she gives an example that I have found very useful.  After discussing meditation, she moves into the both the mysticism and metaphysics of the human condition in relation to the divine.  She brings her treatsie to a close by showing how a trinitarian God (One and Many in the same being) allows for the greatest of loves and the salvation of the individual human person and humanity as community.<br />Dr. Bruteau writes with amazing lucidity and concreteness.  Her arguments follow logically and very analytically.  I am a scientist, and although I appreciate the need of metaphor for describing the transcendent and love mystical poets like Rumi and Tagore, I really appreciated Dr. Bruteau's down to earth writing.  For such complex subjects, Dr. Bruteau's style proved refreshing and easy to follow without ambiguity.  Highly recommended.	2004-03-31

The death of the prince's new groom under mysterious circumstances and the definite homicide of a nobleman prompts Bertie to enlist the detecting powers of Sir Charles Sheridan and Kate Ardleigh, both guests for the weekend.  The life of Daisy plays a significant role in the story, and the authors have done thorough research into this real person, and they bring her to life so that we can see the charm she must have had to attract the prince. The morals and mores of the Marlborough Set, as the friends of the prince are called, drive the action of the story and provide unexpected motives.  The relationship of Charles and Kate deepens, and Charles' responses are particularily delightful.  All in all, another winner from Robin Paige.	2004-03-09

The few I have tried have turned out well, but there are some caveats to the book.  First, Madison relies heavily on very fresh and hard-to-get ingredients, which is great but not very practical if you don't have a big herb and vegetable garden in your yard.  Second, although the directions are complete, she does assume that she is writing for &quot;intermediate&quot; or advanced cooks.  Beginners might be confused as to appropriate end points to some of the steps.  Third, this is not the cookbood for you if you are new to vegetarian cooking or simply cooking a lot of vegetables.  For example, there are only two recipes for fresh asparagus and no instruction on the basics of cooking any vegetable (I'm sure that is her other cookbook).  If you want some specialty, delicious vegetarian recipes for any meal or course, this is a good cookbook.  For basic vegetarian cooking, you should look elsewhere.	2004-03-08

It is even more delightful than the first.  Kate Ardleigh meets Beatrix Potter at a house party and invites her to Bishop's Keep for a visit and adventure.  They certainly have an adventure when a police constable is found murdered, and subsequent inquiries try to blacken his name which would deny his young wife and daughter a pension.  The daughter, Betsy, is a remarkable little girl and a delight, as is the characterization of Beatrix Potter.  Bea knows Sir Charles Sheridan, who arrives to help solve the murder, and she realizes that Kate and Charles have strong feelings for each other.  Sir Charles believes Kate has two other suitors whom she prefers, and Kate is unsure of Charles' regard, or the advisability of becoming involved with a man at all when she wants to remain a mystery author.  The two do a much better job of solving the mystery; Sir Charles with new forensic science (very well depicted by the authors) and Kate with her keen intellect and ability to sense motivations.  They are a perfect partnering, and Paige handles there characterizations with a loving and light touch that are a pleasure to read.  As mentioned above, the advent of forensic science is a major theme in the Victorian Mystery series, and the authors (Paige is a husband-wife writing duo) have researched the field well.  They present not only the the implementation of these new techniques but the dubious responses they received by the general public and juries.  All in all, a delightful and engaging mystery.	2004-03-08
US	52907573	RMXZSKOMILV5R	0373835639	506396617	Devil's Cub	Books	3	5	8	N	Y	Devil's Cub	Devil's Cub is the sequel to These Old Shades and concerns the son of Justin and Leonine, Vidal.  While These Old Shades is my second favorite Heyer, after Frederica, I was disturbed by the character of Vidal in Devil's Cub.  At the book's beginning Heyer shows us two scenes from Vidal's life, in both of which Vidal kills a man (a highwayman and another aristocrat in an impromptu, drunken duel) with no regrets or even concern.  Unlike his father in Shades, who is converted by love into being a better man than he thought possible, Vidal remains a spoiled, little boy on the inside.  That his love interest likes that about him is unfortunate.  I give this book 3-stars for the scenes with Justin, Duke of Avon, which are witty and wonderful.  I just wish more of the father had found himself in the son.	2004-03-08
US	52907573	R2IIW5IVW5GAI3	1581803176	19258691	Creative Correspondence	Books	5	24	24	N	N	creative correspondence	This book truly has some creative ideas for fashioning folded notes and letter sleeves.  The authors start by teaching the basics of measuring, scoring, creasing and cutting paper so that corners are true and lines straight and smoothly cut.  Few tools are needed for this: a bone folder (&lt;$5), a metal ruler, 2 exacto knives and a paperclip (one exacto knife handle is formed into a creasing tool with the paperclip).  The authors give a couple of ways to decorate plain paper, give the post office's size regulations for not incurring extra postage (very handy!), and then it is on to the projects.  I have tried several and the directions are quite clear and easy to follow, and there are several variations for each project depending upon what the purpose of the correspondence (ways to send pictures, booklets, inserts, etc.).  For several projects you can make use of old mail and junkmail, transforming it into beautiful pieces of correspondence.  This book teaches ways to make letters as artful and creative as greeting cards.	2004-02-19

Albom presents a &quot;heaven&quot; without a God and without joy.  I found it trite and depressing.  As far as I can figure, Albom thinks heaven is a way to create closure and explanation for one's life that is not possible in this life.  That makes far too little of both heaven and life on earth.  If you are at all introspective or a believer in any kind of loving god, this book won't get you any farther along the road.	2004-02-18

She starts the book with a large chapter on beaded beads, both seed beads covering a supporting wooden bead (she also teaches you how to paint the wooden bead properly) and beaded beads made entirely of seed beads. None of the projects here are cute and cuddly, but all carry impact.  I am relatively new to beadweaving and I found her instructions very clear.  Her illustrations, as other reviewers have rightly mentioned, are the best in the business.  I tend to learn audibly better than visually, so I need clear illustrations, and hers are the easiest to follow that I have seen.  She also gives several possible vaiations in pattern and bead sizes that will change the look and texture of a technique she has demonstrated.  These variations are very clear, especially as she explains why changing a bead size will increase or decrease a twist for example, and they also then engender a lot of creative thinking.  The inspirational gallery pictures are actually quite inspirational.  I have found this along with her other book, the two best books on beadweaving I have seen.	2004-02-18

For me, the best part of the mystery is seeing how Owen puts together all the pieces of the puzzle to solve the crime; for the reader the mystery isn't that difficult to solve.  Detective work is still new to Archer, and he is a reluctant sleuth.  How he develops the skills to solve the crimes is part of the enjoyment of the series.<br />Candace Robb does a good job of conveying the atmosphere of medieval York, and she is very good at avoiding psychological anachronisms.  Her characters don't psychoanalyze each other, and feelings and motivations are described metaphorically not analytically.<br />The Lady Chapel continues to develop the working relationship between Owen and Thoresby, Archbishop of York.  Owen and Lucie are adapting to married life with some difficulties. This book introduces us to Jasper, a young boy, who witnesses the first murder and then must go into hiding, fending for himself.  He is such a sweet, yet tough, kid; I cheered for him throughout the entire book.  The Lady Chapel should be read after The Apothecary Rose in order to understand the relationships of the characters.  Readers of Rose will enjoy this second installment of the series.	2004-02-17

Kate Ardleigh, an independent American woman who secretly writes \\"penny dreadfuls\\" to pay the bills, accepts an invitation by an English aunt to work as her secretary.  Although she has some trepidations concerning such a major move, she is delighted when she arrives to find that her aunt is willing to buy a brand new Remington type writing machine, and that a murder has occurred in the neighboring town (she hopes she will be able to use the murder as research for her penny dreadfuls).  Her aunt has joined a spiritualist cult group, and the murder victim is found wearing emblems of the cult.  Sir Charles Sheridan, amateur sleuth and photography pioneer, is staying with friends in the area and decides to help the police with their murder investigation.  Sir Charles is fascinated by the new field of forensic science, and he knows much more than the local country police (the police are decidedly ambivalent about Sir Charles' help) about it.  He goes about applying his methods, only to find Kate asking questions and disconcertingly informed on subjects such as fingerprints.  Sir Charles is torn between admiration and exasperation for Kate's intelligence and interest.  Life would be so much more comfortable were Kate a \\"normal\\" Victorian young woman, but on the other hand, Sir Charles is pretty certain that it would be more dull.  Kate has access to inside information on the cult, and Sir Charles has forensic evidence the police don't know how to interpret; and in this first outing of the series, they each race to find the killer, wanting to be the one to solve the case before the other.  Definitely worth reading to find out who wins.	2004-02-17

This edition has both the Spanish and the English translation on facing pages, and knowing very little Spanish, I had to read them in English.  Machado's poems are achingly beautiful when he writes of his native Castile in Spain; I can't judge how good the translation is to the original, but the poems are certainly beautiful in English.  Selections from his proverbs require quite a bit of reflection, and here I felt at a distinct loss at not being able to read the Spanish.  This collection contains poems from throughout his career, so the reader can see where his feelings changed or remained constant over time.	2004-02-17

I can often figure out &quot;whodunit&quot; when I read mysteries, and I appreciate a book where I am unable to do so, as happened here.  Yet when the truth was revealed, I realized that I had been given all of the clues.<br />I thought the character of Inspector Ian Rutledge was very well drawn; I was really able to sympathize with his struggle with shell shock, self-doubt and lost love.  Although his shell shock contributed a lot to how he dealt with the murder case, it didn't distract from the mystery.  His shell shock manifests as the voice of Hamish, a soldier under his command, who Rutledge had shot  for desertion on the front in France.  Some of Hamish's comments were obscure, but I didn't think he got in the way.<br />The story held me in a pretty good grip, accelerating to the end.  It was hard to put down in the last several chapters.  All in all, very well done, and I think deserving of a spot on the top 100 mysteries.	2003-10-31

The directions are impeccable.  I've made cakes, cookies, pies, quick breads, yeast breads, frostings and sauces from this book.  Each one has worked every time.  The hot fudge sauce is spectacular as are the gingersnap cookies.  When I bought this book several years ago, I knew how to make chocolate chip cookies; I was not an experienced baker.  I followed Ms. Cunningham's master recipes to learn how to bake, and now I have a reputation as a great baker.   You can't go wrong baking with Marion Cunningham as your guide.	2003-06-25

They emphasize the origins of cacoa in the New World, and the Spanish conquerors' response to their &quot;discovery&quot; of cacoa.  The story fascinates, and I liked how the authors presented all the options when historical records were scarce or contradictory.  The text is interspersed with clarifying illustrations, some are in color.  The 19th and 20th centuries are covered in brief.  The book ends with the resurgence in deluxe chocolates that use the rarer yet better tasting cacoa beans, and explains why these chocolates are so much better tasting than the supermarket candy bar.  All in all, an excellent read.	2003-06-25

The fairy tales, which are the best parts of the novel, don't really bring about many changes in the main character, Benedick Hunter.  Finding a copy of his mother's fairy tales, he finds himself curious to know why she commited suicide when he was six. So he starts to search for answers.  He continues to read the fairy tales, but after sparking the initial curiosity, they simply become curiosities themselves.  The end is resolved in an overly tidy, quick and improbable manner that disappointed me.  Read the fairy tales and the rest is easily skipped.	2003-05-28

In &quot;Cordelia Underwood&quot; he has created each character (and there are many of them)with wit and insight.  His characters understand the importance of kindness and respect.  They are also, with a couple necessary exceptions, game for adventure, especially when that concerns helping a friend or rescuing a &quot;damsel in distress&quot; (who turns out pretty good at helping herself).  There are stories within stories and intersecting adventures, and I found each a delight.  They all fit together into as pleasurable a novel as I have ever read. You won't regret reading this.	2003-01-24

The print quality is also excellent.  However, I was a little disappointed to see this selection not include some of my favorite poems from Stevenson's work, most notably &quot;The Pleasant Land of Counterpane.&quot;  What is included is exceptionally well done, but this is not the complete Garden of Verses.	2001-11-21

The omniscent narrator sets the epic tone, and this more than the plot or character development carries the story along.  Lucilla's work to bring order to the chaos of Carlingford social life causes her mostly success with a few small failures thrown in, but she doesn't seem to ever grow in awareness as do the heroines of Jane Austen's or Anthony Trollope's novels.  This lack of character development and absence of a strong plot made this novel less satisfying than those of Trollope, Austen, Fielding and the like.  But the narration is amusing and makes the book readable and moderately enjoyable.	2001-11-21
