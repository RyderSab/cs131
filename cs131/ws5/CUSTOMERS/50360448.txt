Second in the Crimson City series from Dorchester, this book takes us into the heart of the underground world of the werewolfs. Again, racial prejudice rears its ugly head when wild child Keeli Maddox hooks up with Vamp outcast Michael. And no one is very happy about it.  <br /> <br />There is a satisfying emotional thread to this book that so many sci-fi writers seem to miss, but on the same note Liu doesn't seem to mind a little blood and guts. The fight scenes are incredibly well done in my eyes. <br /> <br />And to the reviewer who thought the cover was too romance-y... Are we looking at the same book? I see a man in a black leather jacket pulling a sword out as he walks down a street. A full moon dominates the background with a wolf's head imposed over it. What's romance-y about that?	2005-09-24

I don't know about you, but I am not impressed with characters who never feel pain. Fleur feels pain. She gets it in spades in this book. In the heart because of past decisions and present company. In the body when she learns that her training needs to be stepped up a bit after she almost loses her life to a mech.    In this first book of the Crimson City series, you are introduced to the idea of an alternative Los Angeles where demons, werewolves, and vampires exist along side of humans. There is ethnic prejudice galore. For me, Maverick makes a good case of how racial stereotyping makes us look.     If you enjoy this series, I highly recommend the 2176 series that Liz Maverick and Patti O'Shea both participated in. Well done futuristic romances that feature the kind of heroine I like.	2005-09-24

What it doesn't say is that he could have been earning his living teaching others to do the same thing. This book is his effort to share his knowledge and passion for communicating with your psychic self. And he does an amazing job of it. <br /> <br />The chapters flow very well except the last three. I might have been tempted to switch the order so that \\"Cleansing Yourself Of Pain And Negativity\\" came second to last simply because it is a very important lesson for anyone who wants to exercise their own abilities. And Mr. Wands makes it very clear that anyone can do what he does. In fact he encourages people to explore this part of themselves by offering simple things to do. He emphasizes the idea that all you have to do is pay attention. <br /> <br />I have over 20 years of working as a psychic both intuitive and in conjunction with the Tarot cards. Even I learned quite a bit from this gentle book that relies on anecdotes and compassion to relay a message of hope and communication. I highly recommend this book if you are even the slightest bit interested in what it takes to open up your own psychic self. Even if you don't care about that, the stories alone are worth the book. He also gives some excellent tips on how to avoid being scammed by a fake psychic.	2005-09-10

If you like Harry Potter and you like chick lit and you like books that make you LOL, then you must read &lt;u>Enchanted, INC.&lt;/u> by Shanna Swendson. Ballantine Books is her publisher and they made a really good choice with this book. <br /> <br />I just finished it. It is the best chick lit I've read and that includes Jenny Crusie whom I think ROCKS! But this one uses a great idea of there being fairies and pixies and elves and OH MY in New York City. Most can't see them but those that can are very valuable to a company by the name of Magic, Spells and Incantations, Inc AKA MSI,Inc. Throw in one small town Texas girl who sees things for what they really are and you have the recipe for a captivating book. <br /> <br />She's hung up on the cute, but shy, guy who happens to be the most powerful wizard on board. Her mundane friends start dating frogs because of her but she can't tell them! There are layers and twists and turns in this book that kept me ribbeted.... sorry, riveted! I am eagerly awaiting her next offering. Anyone who can make me laugh this hard is on my must-buy list and don't even think about borrowing this one! Get your own. I am going to reread it!	2005-08-09

I meant to bring the book in to quote one paragraph that sums her voice up, but left it at home.    This was my first book by Ms. Armstrong. A friend told me I had to read this one. She was right. Well-written in a strong, stand-alone voice, _Dime Store Magic_ will go on my keeper shelf once I buy my own copy. I will also order her backlist and am heading to the store today to look for _Industrial Magic_.    The relationship between 20-30 something Paige Winterbourne and her 13 going on 40 year old ward is almost too real. I found myself sympathetic to both sides. Armstrong masters the teenage angst and doesn't make it laughable at all.    If I had to quibble then I would say her mocking Wiccans with one broad brush is a bit much. I am Wiccan though and I found most of the comments really funny. Although, most Wiccans wouldn't do the hysterical ritual in the backyard. But it's fiction! And if I can't laugh at myself, who can I laugh at, right?    The concept is fresh. The relationships are built slowly and tightly. The plot is character-driven. The characters make mistakes and grow from them.    I can't say enough good things about this book!	2004-09-16

Only from the mind of Sherrilyn Kenyon would this be even remotely possible.  <br /> <br />I swallowed this book whole last night. Bought it and finished it within six hours. Fantastic read! I loved the attraction between Bride and Vane. I knew in Sunshine's book that we would have to see more of Bride and of Vane. They were obviously those type of characters that leap off the page at a writer and demand their own story. <br /> <br />There was more humor in this book than some of the others. I had the feeling that the fairies were at play while Ms. Kenyon typed away. Fury's mashed potato experience had me laughing out loud. Hope I didn't wake the neighbors. <br /> <br />And the tenderness. Oh the tenderness! I wept for joy at points in this book. And I identified with Bride in more than one way. She is a heroine you can definitely love! And the moment Vane put a bigger slice of cake on her plate, ... well, let's just say that was a deal sealer for me.  <br /> <br />If you haven't read anything by Sherrilyn, pick this one up. This book is a sheer joy to read. Definitely goes on the keeper shelf for me.	2004-09-01

Roxanne St.Claire manages to weave a sexy, fast-paced race across the continent. She builds not just believable characters, but characters that you want to be, to meet, to sit down and have a drink with. <br /> <br />Janine is not your \\"spunky\\" heroine cliche. She is someone who conquers her own fears and exhibits flaws. Luc struggles with guilt and remorse both from his past as well as his present attraction to Janine. <br /> <br />Their subsequent travels across the continent force them to face not just fears but feelings of attraction as well. There is danger and you feel the tension that comes from a well-drawn villain as well. <br /> <br />The ending surpassed \\"happily ever after\\" for me and transcended into \\"yeah, that's the way it should go\\".  <br /> <br />Thanks to Ms. St.Claire for a book that offered twists and turns that kept me up at night. I will be buying anything with her name on it from now on.	2004-08-22

We meet Kevla as a girl without a father working the marketplace seeking customers for her mother's wares. When she is found by a great uhlah, you will remember what it was like to be a little girl or boy who had fantastic dreams of far-away places that contained princes and princesses. Only Kevla's come true. Sort of...      And it is that sort of that the entire book hinges on. She does go live in the palace, but her life there is not exactly what she thought it might be. Her very existence is based on lies of omission and half truths until one day her dreams bring her into the vivid nightmare of reality. People die. People she loves turn their backs on her. She is betrayed by her own dreams.      Rescued from certain death by a power she has only been toying with, Kevla must undertake a journey to reunite her country that has been split into warring clans for decades and more. Without her, her country will fall to the Shadow. But her own fear of her power leads her up a mountain into the waiting jaws of the Great Red Dragon. She sacrifices all that she is to this God of her land. The outcome will surprise you and shock you as well as delight you.      Christie Golden is a multi-published author, but this is her first book in the Luna line. Luna promises to deliver a \\"new face in fantasy\\" and Christie has certainly held up her end of the bargain. If you love fantasies that wrap you up and pull you in like Mercedes Lacky or Stephen Donaldson or Charles DeLint, then this book is for you. Take a chance and travel to Arukan where you will meet a little girl whose destiny will lead her to love, despair, and triumph but she can't stop there.      This is the first novel in a series. The next will be about the Stone Dancer. You can also follow Luna and Christie at eharlequin.com's Luna community \\"The Lorekeepers' Loft: The Elements and Beyond with Christie Golden.

I picked this one up because I am working on a kick-ass heroine of my own. (yes I write but I am not published)<br />The back blurb promised a helluva a ride and the author totally delivered. I will look up other books in the series, but I will most definitely search for other books by Liz Maverick. <br />Jenny Red instantly engages you. She grabs you by the heart and thrusts you into her world. Then when Deck hits the scene or the scene hits the Deck, all hell breaks loose. It's a wild ride from that time forward. The story gripped me by the throat and didn't let go. <br />I highly recommend this as the perfect book for anyone who doesn't like to be bored when they read.	2004-07-20

She has written a transitional book that will move a beginner down the path and out of the plethora of basics books.  I have already recommended this book as a reading choice for a group I am with.  But I am also recommending this book to students basic as well as advanced. <br />I started down this path when Venecia was 8 years old. I absorbed much from this book nonetheless.  Of course, I don't think you can't teach an old b!tch new tricks. :-)  One of the more interesting experiences that happened to me was reading her words about learning to pay attention to symbols. As I was reading I realized I was ignoring a robin just outside my balcony. He was singing his good morning song and I had my nose stuck in a book. <br />I could go into details about this book, but suffice it to say that I think it is an important piece of work.  You will gain from it what you put into it.<br />She takes a four pronged approach exhorting her reader to LEARN, THINK, QUESTION and DO.  If you can really absorb what she is trying to say, you will, in fact, advance. Even if you have been pagan for over twenty years.	2004-07-02

Learn how they got to be who they are.<br />Then you will learn how to use the Archetypes to Create Characters. As most writers understand, great characters are not one-dimensional and flawless. It is their layers that make them truly intriguing. Indiana Jones' fear of snakes made him believable.<br />Finally play with Archetype Interactions and see how the Waif might react to the Professor type. What if the Waif were layered with the Librarian and the Professor had a bit of the Swashbuckler in him. What would these two encounter? Where would they take your story?<br />Tami et al's book is invaluable to me. If I had no other book on characterization, I would be fine. My only quibble is that we didn't get the Villains, but Tami teaches a Villains Archetype class online as well as face-to-face.

I never got it back so I had to go on a search to find it again. It begins with a Burmese python who is taken from her native home and winds up in a pet store. There she meets a rattlesnake, a parrot, a coatimundi and a lemur. One of them has heard about a place that is a haven for animals. The five animals decide to embark on a quest to find this Sandeagozu. <br />I must admit that I didn't get the title until I had read several chapters into the book. But Jenner's first novel captures what animals might feel in unpleasant situations. The Macaw is a plucker which I can identify with since I own several large parrots one of whom is a plucked Blue and Gold macaw. She gets into the whys of the bird's plucking that really worked for me.<br />The novel does have some bumps that could have been smoothed out, but it was a first novel. If you enjoy animals and feel that they have personalities and lives beyond what is the normally accepted POV, then I recommend this book.	2003-12-08

The night I got them a group of us drew from the deck and passed the book around to read the meanings of the cards we had drawn. They are not like some oracular devices where nearly anything you read can be applied to you. These really struck at the heart of each and every person there.<br />I put them away after that and really didn't use them much until last night. That is what prompted me to come here to write a review. I have read Tarot since 1988 (professionally since 1993). These are not Tarot, but if you are familiar with Tarot, then you will see the similarities.<br />One of the major challenges of this (and any round deck) is the tilt aspect. Up or down is simple. But when the card has the image flying to your right or left, then you have to stop and really apply yourself to the reading at hand.<br />I don't know that I would use this deck to do readings for others (I still read professionally), but as a meditation tool for myself, I find it very useful.<br />If you are looking for something a bit different to give that Tarot addict you know, do consider this deck.	2003-12-08

Wandering the roads with the hero. Wondering just who Rabble could be (I never guessed the ending so so much for predictable endings). This book did more than just offer a good read. It built a world I could easily live and breathe in. Each time I opened the pages I stepped into the world of Lindskold's making.<br />This book landed on my keeper shelf.

She offered hysterical characters that didn't devolve into caricatures. Her sensitivity to gay and lesbian issues was very much appreciated by me as well.<br />I happen to love neat wrap-ups. Everyone was taken care of by the end except for our Mr. Bryon. I am actually hoping that her next book will be the woman that conquers him and puts him in his place. <br />Liz Pemberly and her gang will go on my shelf of keepers. First chick lit book to do that!

Thank you to Julia Quinn for a very entertaining read. Sophie and Benedict had my heart from the start and never let go!	2002-07-16

What a mistake! It is without a doubt one of the worst books on stones I have ever read. <br />One of the more amusing things it says is that black tourmaline is useless other than perhaps for helping potted plants grow. Aquamarine is good for getting your energy up and amethyst as well.<br />I have worked with stones in a metaphysical way for over 20 years and laughed my way through most of this book once I got over the fact that I had actually spent money on it!<br />Said to be channelled by a group from the Pleiades, I truly think that the writer needed to change the channel.	2002-01-05

You can learn exactly what she thought of certain BNP (Big Nosed Pagans).<br />Overall the book is very well-written and is a fast read, but my one quibble would be that there was too much gossip and not enough introspection on her part. I would definitely recommend it though.	2002-01-05

And if you rehome a bird, then it gives you some fabulous information on how to overcome old habits.  I have many birds, some rehomed and some not, and I use this book for all of them.	2001-10-02

When I was driving 7.5 hours one way on a Friday and then back again on Sunday, I needed something that went beyond music. I stopped in a truck stop and perused the audio books. The Destroyer series looked fun. <br />It has been sheer pleasure to listen to! I even (now that I am no longer driving so much) listen to them in the car for the shorter commute.<br />Cheesy? Campy? Silly? Sure! That is exactly what makes them so much fun. I was a huge fan of the old Green Hornet series and these books remind me of that. They are graphic in description for sure, but listening to Richard Sapir read them is marvelous. He is very talented.<br />I will be buying more of the audio books.	2001-08-20

Ok, so the title is catchy, but what about the inside? Is there meat inside?<br />You bet. Francesca writes from the gut and the heart and balances it with a practical \\"do the work\\" attitude. This is one little book that is a must on my shelf. <br />In my 20+ years I have read a lot of books. Some were stinkers and some were fabulous. This is one of the fabulous ones and one I hand to all my students at some point in their path and say \\"Read it.\\"<br />So to you, I say \\"read it\\". You will like it.	2001-07-29

If you are thinking of joining a coven, read this. If you are thinking of starting and/or leading a coven, use this book to beat yourself about the head and shoulders with! <br />Seriously, Judy's contributions to the pagan community are many. She has a counseling website that is amazing, but this book is hands-down the best on this subject. She has absolutely &quot;been there, done that&quot; and I am sure her T-shirt is old, too.<br />Running any group is difficult, but when you throw religion into the mix... it is threetimes as difficult. It hits you mentally, spiritually and physically. Harrow's book is like having an elder friend to turn to when times get rough. She goes into group dynamics and interpersonal relating as well. <br />My copy will probably have to be replaced because I know I am wearing it out.	2001-07-03

Mr. Kunz is a bit on the dry side, but his information is superlative. Many of the pagan books of today don't give enough resources... Mr. Kunz does. I realize he is not a pagan author, but this is a useful resource for pagans interested in stone work. Here is where Scott Cunningham got much of his lore!	2001-06-15

And I loved the biker character crossover from Yarrow. I have read nearly every book by Mr. De Lint. This is one I had, loaned, lost and repurchased in Trade format. Lyrical and dreamy on one hand and then harsh and clear-eyed on the other. I liked the juxtapositions.	2001-06-15

It is futuristic and, truth-be-told, when I saw the film \\"Johnny Mnemonic\\", I thought that show was based on this book. Fabulously entertaining and a fast ride from start to finish.<br />Take one \\"Claver\\" who is a descendant of the American Indians who withdrew from the overpolluted 21st century. Add one \\"rat\\" who is a girl living on her wits in the slums. Toss in one unique piece of technology that the Yakuza from the \\"Props\\" are after. Now you have one wicked book.  But don't stop there. Let's add in a coyote who might be a Trickster God and then again might be just a coyote. <br />De Lint does urban fantasy like no one else. This is the only futuristic one of his that I know of (but that isn't saying much). He casts believable characters in a frighteningly real \\"what if\\" future. I have read this book time and time again.	2001-06-15

This book's only flaw is that it expects you to understand body shapes of birds. Still, you can't get by in the field without a guide and Peterson's is one of the best. Its size makes it perfect to stick in a backpack next to your binoculars or ride on the floor of your car which is where mine is quite often!	2001-06-15

I am not so impressed with all the vampire-wannabes so the fact that this was werewolves intrigued me. Truthfully, I expected to waste my money.<br />I didn't. This is a taut fiction that has been very well written. Donna Boyd is now on my list of authors to look for and the first in this series (I hope it is a series... I want more)_The Promise_ is on my wishlist now.<br />From the first moment to the last I was captivated by the werewolves among us theme. That they felt themselves above humans was part of their arrogant charm. Do buy this one!	2000-12-16

I heard Ms.Thordis Simonsen speak in Bowling Green, OH some years ago. She spoke about Miss Sara Brooks with such tenderness and love that it made me think of the woman who raised me. I bought a paperback copy for myself and a hardcover for Thelma.     We both enjoyed the book. It is a backdoor peek into the times that were.  If you think racism is overwrought white liberals and selfish black radicals seeking more than is theirs, think again. This narrative will bring it to your front door and you will not be able to look away.	2000-12-16

I picked it up while shopping with a friend and her 4 yr old. I was watching him play in the kids' area so I wanted to be occupied. I never put this back on the shelf. I expected to pick it up and laugh because I am a witch.<br />Boy was I wrong and I am very glad that I was. L.T. Samuels should be commended for not trying to convert anyone with these simple spells. Every spell is designed to encourage the child to be imaginative and inventive. I was particularly taken with the Spell to Cheer Someone Up. Of course, chocolate-dipped strawberries will make me happy everytime.<br />I do not have kids, but my friends with kids will be hounded to buy this one. You could buy this for any child who wants to dream and be a kid for as long as possible. <br />It says for ages 7-12, but I think you could use some of these spells for younger ones with adult supervision.<br />A must-have on my bookshelf!	2000-12-16

He has some excellent parts to his book as well as some that may make you giggle. I have to admit that the  foil helmet of the God caused me to laugh until I cried.

It is not a bad book. It just stumbles in some pretty entertaining places. The mixing up of the Deities is droll if you think about it. Confusing Frigga with Freya? :-) A minor mishap on the road  to life, y'all.  Overall the book does teach the beginner if the beginner  is willing to learn. But to learn you have to question and to question you  certainly need a broader base than one book. No, it will not make you a  Wiccan by going through all the steps. That is simply not possible. You  must do the work in your heart and continue to do it to grow.<br />She is a  bit dogmatic at spots and tends to overemphasize her *rightness*, but hey!  This was her first book. The others show her growth as a writer. Again, I  recommend this to my own students with the caveat that ALL writers write  from their own personal slant. Why else write? Take your salt cellar and  enjoy.	2000-01-01
