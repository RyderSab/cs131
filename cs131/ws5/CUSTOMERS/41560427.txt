Wood published in 1997 sometime to check the Table of Contents on pages 85-90, and compare it with Kant's original Table of Contents from 1781 on page 125, to observe how many parts of this book have become so well known that scholars consulting this monument to philosophical thought feel a need for 132 page references to find whatever interest in Kant they might have at a particular moment.  Such a summary might have been open before Nietzsche when he wrote in section 110 of THE GAY SCIENCE that \\"Over immense periods of time the intellect produced nothing but errors. . . .  Such erroneous articles of faith, which were continually inherited, until they became almost part of the basic endowment of the species, include the following:  that there are enduring things; that there are equal things; that there are things, substances, bodies; that a thing is what it appears to be; that our will is free; that what is good for me is also good in itself.\\"  Kant was concerned with transcendental philosophy, the general problem of pure reason, but in I, Transcendental doctrine of elements, Division one, Book II, Chapter II, Section III, 3, A on \\"principle of persistence of substance\\" can be found on page 299;  Division two, Book II, Chapter II, Section IX, III, \\"The possibility of causality through freedom\\" can be found on page 535; and in II, Transcendental doctrine of method, Chapter II, Section II, \\"On the ideal of the highest good\\" can be found on page 676.<br /><br />Kant's practice of using large heavy type in the text for key terms makes his points much easier to locate in the Cambridge University Press edition, which features some of the heaviest type I ever saw in a book.  Page numbers for the A (1781) and B (1787) editions are located in the outer margins, making it easy to locate quotations by later philosophers who frequently invite their students to read the original work.  Schopenhauer, in particular, was adamant that Kant spoiled the 1781 edition when he removed pages 348 to 392 and \\"introduced a number of remarks that controverted it\\" (THE WORLD AS WILL AND REPRESENTATION, translated by E. F. J. Payne, Vol. 1, p. 435) in 1787.  This part of the Second Book of the Transcendental Dialectic, First Chapter, The paralogisms of pure reason, was originally intended by Kant to illustrate forms of reason which imitate logical thought, and appealed strongly to Schopenhauer as a basis for his own philosophy, which he declared had placed Will in place of Kant's thing-in-itself as claimed in the 22nd chapter in the second book of WWR, vol. 1, pp. 110-112.  Kant was not trying to make things easier for the philosophers who followed him by providing an easy platform they could use to proclaim their own views, as even Schopenhauer discerned when he complained that Fichte had \\"succeeded in turning the public's attention from Kant to himself, and in giving to German philosophy the direction in which it was afterwards carried further by Schelling, finally reaching its goal in the senseless sham wisdom of Hegel.\\"  (WWR, Vol. 1, pp. 436-437).<br /><br />Schopenhauer does not appear in the index of the Cambridge University Press edition of Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON, but the index can be used to locate a few notes on Swedenborg.  In Gregory R. Johnson's Introduction for KANT ON SWEDENBORG, Kant's knowledge of Swedenborg's writings are linked to some of the key ideas in Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON.  \\"Finally, Swedenborg claims that his visions of the spiritual world do not show the spirit world as it is in itself.  Instead, his visions are spatio-temporal representations of a non-spatio-temporal reality.  Spiritual realities take on this spatio-temporal garb to accommodate themselves to the requirements of a finite intellect.  These teachings presage such central tenets of Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON (1781, 1787) as transcendental idealism and the ideality of space and time.\\"  (KANT ON SWEDENBORG, p. xviii).  The notes about Swedenborg on pages 731 and 753 of Kant's CRITIQUE call attention to his \\"ironic attack on Swedenborgian spiritualism in DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER (1766)\\" and spiritual qualities lampooned then which reappear in Kant's elucidation of the limits imposed by the general conditions of experience:<br /><br />\\" . . . or a special fundamental power of our mind to intuit the future (not merely, say, to deduce it), or, finally, a faculty of our minds to stand in a community of thoughts with other men (no matter how distant they may be) -- these are concepts the possibility of which is entirely groundless, because it cannot be grounded in experience and its known laws, and without this it is an arbitrary combination of thoughts that, although it contains no contradiction, still can make no claim to objective reality, thus to the possibility of the sort of object that one would here think.  As far as reality is concerned, it is evidently intrinsically forbidden to think it in concreto without getting help from experience, because it can only pertain to sensation, as the matter of experience, and does not concern the form of the relation that one can always play with in fictions.\\"  (CPR, A 222-223, B 270, p. 324).<br /><br />For example of Kant's always already unthink fictions, I would like to suggest the experience of a rock concert, in which a crowd knows the most popular song of the evening.  It could be Liz Phair, doing a recent song, `stars and planets' in which \\"You know it's just the same old story.  Stars rise and stars fall.  But the ones that shine the brightest aren't stars at all.  They're the planets just like us. . . .  They're the planets that unite us.  And from big to small.

Friedrich is dated October, 1949, prime time for those who expected Kant to appear as a mighty mind proclaiming the need for world government by delivering mighty propositions.  Kant's IDEA FOR A UNIVERSAL HISTORY (1784) is concerned primarily with its Seventh Principle, \\"The problem of the establishment of a perfect civic constitution depends upon the problem of a lawful external relationship of the states and cannot be solved without the latter.\\"  (p. 123).  To put it mildly:<br /><br />That is to say, wars, the excessive and never-ending preparation for wars, and the want which every state even in the midst of peace must feel--all these are means by which nature instigates attempts, which at first are inadequate, but which, after many devastations, reversals and a very general exhaustion of the states' resources, may accomplish what reason could have suggested to them without so much sad experience, namely; to leave the lawless state of savages and to enter into a union of nations wherein each, even the smallest state, could expect to derive its security and rights--not from its own power or its own legal judgment--but only from this great union of nations (Foedus Amphictyonum) and from united power and decisions according to the united will of them all.  (p. 124).<br /><br />The attempts which have been made to date are hardly encouraging, and when a global superpower sees the need for a revolution somewhere, it is hardly surprising that the world is approaching a situation in which *I*was*of*three*minds*like a tree*in*which*there*were*three*Iraqis.  Among three alternatives considered by Kant, be mindful of his inability to ultimately predict:<br /><br />. . . that all these effects and counter-effects will in the long run result in nothing, or at least nothing sensible, and that things will remain as they always have been and therefore one cannot predict that the discord which is natural to the species is in the end preparing us for a hell of evils, evil in an ever so civilized state because perhaps nature will destroy, by barbaric devastation, this entire state and all advances of culture (a fate which one may well suffer with the government of blind accident which is indeed identical with lawless freedom if no wisely conceived direction of nature is imputed thereto)--these three alternatives . . .  (p. 125).<br /><br />Among the reasons advanced by Kant for his Eighth Principle favoring an enlightened constitution, is, \\"Eventually, even war will become a very dubious enterprise, not only because its result on both sides is so uncertain and artificial, but because in its aftermath the state consequently finds itself saddled with a growing debt the repayment of which becomes undeterminable.\\"  (pp. 128-129).  Kant's suggests lamely that other states might \\"offer themselves as arbiters and thus start a future great government of which there is no previous example in history.\\"  (p. 129)  His Ninth Principle favors a philosophical history of the world which is primarily concerned with \\"what nations and governments have contributed toward world government or how they have damaged it.  We may be concerned with this and may also consider (that) the ambition of rulers and their servants (should) be directed toward the only means which could secure a glorious reputation for them in later ages.\\"  (p. 131).<br /><br />This volume ends with Kant's \\"Eternal Peace\\" from 1795.  Almost everything in this volume, The Modern Library 1949 edition of THE PHILOSOPHY OF KANT, was translated into English by Carl J. Friedrich, who manages to smooth Kant's sentences to produce the minimum amount of verbal whiplash.  The CRITIQUE OF JUDGMENT is based on the translation of James C. Meredith, but is somewhat simplified from what I have in the James Creed Meredith translation in GREAT BOOKS volume 39, KANT, which starts:<br /><br />Philosophy may be said to contain the principles of the rational cognition that concepts affordus of things (not merely, as with logic, the principles of the form of thought in general irrespective of the objects), and, thus interpreted, the course, usually adopted, of dividing it into theoretical and practical is perfectly sound.  (GREAT BOOKS, 39, KANT, p. 463).<br /><br />As edited by Carl J. Friedrich, this becomes:<br /><br />Philosophy contains the principles for rational knowledge that concepts afford us of things but not as Logic does, which contains merely the principles of the form of thought in general, irrespective of objects.  Hence the usual course of dividing philosophy into the theoretical and the practical is perfectly sound.  (THE PHILOSOPHY OF KANT, p. 265).<br /><br />The GREAT BOOKS edition also includes the Preface to the First Edition 1790 and Contents with Roman Numerals in the Introduction for I through IX; First Part, Critique of Aesthetic Judgement, consisting of Book I and Book II within Section I; and a Section II.  The Second Part has First Division (Analytic of Teleological Judgement) and Second Division:  Dialectic of Teleological Judgement.

US	41560427	R32YLOXL7OEWJN	0520069781	899788292	Philosophy as Metanoetics (Nanzan Studies in Religion and Culture)	Books	5	19	26	N	N	Let "the Old Testament prophet Jeremiah show us the way"	Tanabe Hajime wrote his Preface for PHILOSOPHY AS METANOETICS in October 1945, a year after delivering his final series of lectures on which this book is based at Kyoto Imperial University.  Though he fell ill in November 1944, he left his sickbed just long enough to deliver lectures until \\"It was with a great sigh of relief that I completed the final lecture in December, after which I spent the rest of the winter in bed.\\"  (p. lix).  The book uses some Greek words to describe the kind of change involved in religious experiences that parallel the philosophy which gave Tanabe Hajime the strength to complete his final year before retirement in the midst of \\"the hunger and poverty of the vast majority of the people in sharp contrast with the luxury enjoyed by a very few owing to the maldistribution of food and goods,\\" (p. lxi), notably, \\"Since metanoesis implies remorse and sorrow, it is necessarily accompanied by feelings of shame and guilt.\\"  (p. lx).<br /><br />The Japanese Ministry of Education sent Tanabe to study in Europe in 1922, where he spent a year in Berlin before going to Freiburg to study with Husserl.  Heidegger tutored him privately in German philosophy.  Numerous thinkers familiar from this tradition are mentioned in this book, including Walter Kaufmann, who did not get a Ph.D. until 1947, a year after the Japanese version of the book was published.  Kaufmann's English translations of THE WILL TO POWER, ECCE HOMO, and THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA by Nietzsche were used for the University of California Press translation of this book into English in 1986:  \\"that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity\\" (p. 298).<br /><br />The first paragraph of Tanabe's Preface states an extreme condition about which philosophers have frequently had a desire to complain.  \\"All public opinion, except for propaganda in favor of the government's policy, was suppressed.  Freedom of thought was severely restricted, and the only ideas given official recognition were those of the extreme rightists.\\"  (p. il).  In a democratic society, a similar complaint is heard whenever rightists feel they have some mandate from the last election or public reaction to events such as 9/11.  While I did not play a large part in the movement opposing the Vietnam war as an undesirable aspect of American foreign policy, I was subject to what Tanabe called \\"a radical self-awareness\\" (p. l) of how weak the American position in Vietnam as a global superpower desiring peace with honor fit the dialectical basis for a religious situation, where \\"anything I achieve apart from true zange can only be immediately contradicted by reality itself. ...  This is in fact the basic principle that shapes history.  In terms of its concrete content, metanoetics is a radical historicism in that the continuous repetition of zange provides basic principles for the circular development of history.\\"  (p. lii).<br /><br />Bitter experience is the basis for the insight, \\"Quite by accident I was led along the same path that Shinran followed in Buddhist doctrine, although in my case it occurred in the philosophical realm.\\"  (p. lii).  Chapters 6 and 7 are based on the three stages of religious transformation of the Pure Land Shin sect established by Shinran (1173-1262).<br /><br />Tanabe Hajime was originally a student in mathematics who discovered that he did not have the ability to solve problems in mathematics at a university level.  He turned to philosophy, only to end his career with `a philosophical method of \\"destruction\\" more radical than even the methodical skepticism of Descartes.  It cannot be treated on the same level as philosophy up to the present inasmuch as it is a philosophy achieved through a death-and-resurrection process of transformation.'  (p. lv).  \\"In the radical self-consciousness of being driven to the extreme, reason can only be torn to shreds in absolute disruption, after which such self-affirming reason is no longer of any use to us.  Absolute criticism means that reason, faced with the absolute crisis of its dilemma, surrenders itself of its own accord.\\"  (p. lvi).  Basing everything on \\"a relationship of reciprocal mediatory transformation between the absolute and the self\\" (p. lvii), the only possibility of irony is that a rightist campaign identifying flip-flops always works to put together a democratic majority of voters who can't figure out the message.  Nevertheless, anyone interested in advanced oriental thought in a world dominated by superpower politics should find plenty of food for thought in this book.y use to us.

US	41560427	R2MG8EG94BF0Z	0804742928	305994198	Kant's 'Critique of Pure Reason'	Books	5	5	15	N	N	Get a thorough understanding the easy way	Taking an interest in philosophy in an attempt to characterize the elements of cognition that drive an entire society in directions that it would never contemplate going, if only the always already unthunk could control events as thoroughly as groups maintain strict limits on the options they are willing to consider, I'm having trouble identifying an element of irony that could make my review of KANT'S CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON by Theodor W. Adorno suitable for the comic times in which we live.  First of all, the book is not about politics, however much Adorno wishes to characterize Kant's philosophy as seeking a form of enlightenment that served the interest of \\"bourgeois resignation,\\" (p. 6) in opposition to the authority of other absolutes while expressing \\"the enthusiasm of the youthful bourgeoisie which has not yet started its never-ending complaints that reason cannot solve anything, but which still feels confident of its ability to achieve things by virtue of the power of its own reason\\" (p. 54).  At the top of this heap of ideas is autonomy, a situation in which \\"the judge and the accused are one and the same; that the authority that is free and independent simultaneously represents the law.  This is the founding conception of his entire universe.\\"  (pp. 54-55).<br /><br />Then the tradition of bourgeois rationalism forms a contrast with \\"the irrationality of the whole, that is to say, the blindness of the forces at work, and with that the inability of the individual to determine his own life in accordance with reason, remains intact.\\"  (p. 64).  Because Kant desires to rid metaphysical thinking of mythologies that have typically been adopted as absolutes, this form of certainty as the ultimate foundation for cognition is blocked.  \\"In this sense Kantian philosophy is one that enshrines the validity of the non-identical in the most emphatic way possible.  It is a mode of thought that is not satisfied by reducing everything that exists to itself.\\"  (p. 66).  Comedy might be more emphatic with some *Excuse*me* regarding offensive pretensions, but this book, with lectures delivered from 12 May 1959 to 30 July 1959, translated from the German by Rodney Livingstone, with Editor's Notes (pp. 238-281) by Rolf Tiedemann, provides a philosophical context for evaluating how well Kant's book, THE CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON can be understood in our own times.<br /><br />The English translation of CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON by Norman Kemp Smith (1928) has been used to match the quotes by Adorno, but after mentioning the KANT-LEXICON (ed. Rudolf Eisler) in Lecture Six, notes 7, 8 and 11 for that lecture distinguish which sentences in some quotations \\"are Eisler's summary of Kant's position.\\"  (p. 248).  The translation by Norman Kemp Smith has been identified by Raymond B. Blakney in AN IMMANUEL KANT READER (1960) as being literal, which \\"reproduces the original, as exactly as possible, idiom and all, in the vocabulary of the receiving language.\\"  Adorno's lectures are much easier to read than the J. M. D. Meiklejohn translation of THE CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON at the beginning of Great Books volume 39, Kant.  The sections numbered 1 through 23 of the First Division of Transcendental Logic were the easiest to locate for comparison with comments in the lecture.  Philosophy is a field that benefits from having many points of view, but Kant is rarely clear when he attempts to use terminology which combine them all in the same sentence.  Adorno attempts to explain what Kant was trying to say, \\"the central concept that his critique of reason is based on, the concept of the transcendental\\" (p. 16).  Other translations might seem to miss the point, or perhaps Meiklkejohn merely paraphrased all of section 16 into this single paragraph:<br /><br />*The manifold content given in a sensuous intuition comes necessarily under the original synthetical unity of apperception, because thereby alone is the unity of intuition possible (Section 13).  But that act of the understanding, by which the manifold content of given representations (whether intuitions or conceptions) is brought under one apperception, is the logical function of judgements (Section 15).  All the manifold, therefore, in so far as it is given in one empirical intuition, is determined in relation to one of the logical functions of judgement, by means of which it is brought into union in one consciousness.  Now the categories are nothing else than these functions of judgement, so far as the manifold in a given intuition is determined in relation to them (Section 9).  Consequently, the manifold in a given intuition is necessarily subject to the categories of understanding.*  (GREAT BOOKS, 39, KANT, p. 52).<br /><br />Maybe that is just missing a Note that was added to the second edition in 1787, from which Adorno stated that Kant \\"maintains in one of the decisive passages of the book that it (namely the synthetic unity of apperception) is the highest point to which he has `attached' his entire philosophy.\\"  (p. 16).  The 2001 note on the 1787 note states:<br /><br />\\"Adorno has in mind here the Note to Section 16 of the Transcendental Deduction in which Kant states:  `The synthetic unity of apperception is therefore the highest point to which we must ascribe [heften = attach. Trans.] all employment of the understanding, even the whole of logic, and conformably therewith, transcendental philosophy.'  CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON, p. 154, B 134.\\"  (n. 6, p. 242).<br /><br />Reading Kant is not likely to be a pleasure until the reader has some reason to think that we know what it means, but the comic view of all this might be far more advanced than what most readers will find in these lectures.  One joke in this book is originally by Nietzsche, with \\"the pun on the American expression `backwoodsman' when he described Kant as an `otherworldsman' [Hinterweltler].\\"  (p. 109).  Another note says Nietzsche might have been thinking of someone else and THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA in The Portable Nietzsche has a less specific, \\"On the Afterwordly.\\"  TPN, p. 142).  Adorno ought to get credit for besting Nietzsche's joke.hat act of the understanding, by which the manifold content of given representations (whether intuitions or conceptions) is brought under one apperception, is the logical function of judgements (Section 15).

In CARL SCHMITT'S CRITIQUE OF LIBERALISM / AGAINST POLITICS AS TECHNOLOGY, John P. McCormick reiterates a few themes which tie Schmitt to now-familiar conservative thoughts of ten years ago, when those who were seeking for ways that America could distinguish itself from all others as a superpower exhibiting technological powers excelling all other forms of thought could look to Schmitt for ideas that would transcend Max Weber's categories of modernity by employing emergency powers to establish absolutely new political conditions that would be more appealing than the flip-flops of liberalism.  The collapse of the German fantasy with which Schmitt is most closely associated for supporting the use of emergency powers in Germany is the single most compelling argument frequently mentioned as an aside by McCormick to discredit Schmitt as a theorist of effective politics, but McCormick was writing far too long ago to make reference to the forms of confusion that dominate the news in 2005:  Katrina was a natural disaster that made pre-storm evacuation look like the best policy, while voters in Iraq are preparing to vote on a constitution which has already missed a deadline for the Parliament to determine what Iraqis would agree to state in their constitution.  This book is philosophical enough to associate Hegel, who was mentioned in the longest footnote in THE CONCEPT OF THE POLITICAL, with what the importance of any particular moment might be, and Chapter 1 of this book will satisfy those who would like the contrast of Schmitt as a student of Max Weber to a Marxist who was also devoted to \\"secular messianic Judaism\\"  (p. 35) and was denounced by Schmitt as a Jew and a Marxist during the years of National Socialism in Germany.  Among the things that I did not previously know about Carl Schmitt, note 12 on pages 35-36 reveals:<br /><br />Schmitt was certainly a believing Roman Catholic in the early twenties, writing frequently in the Catholic press but never officially joining the Catholic Center Party.  He was excommunicated by the Church in 1926 because of the complexities of his marital situation.  He apparently grew quite bitter toward the Church in the late Weimar Republic, publicly feuding with the more moderate Center party.  His antipathy reached its peak under National Socialism, as he is quoted to have said in 1938:  \\"If the Pope excommunicates a nation so therefore does he only excommunicate himself.\\" ...<br /><br />Chapter 2, \\"Myth as Antidote to the \\"Age of Neutralizations\\":  Nietzsche and Cultural Conflict as Response to Technology, manages to quote a page of section 373 of THE GAY SCIENCE by Nietzsche, but it omits Nietzsche's conclusion arising out of an understanding of music:<br /><br />But an essentially mechanical world would be an essentially meaningless world.  Assuming that one estimated the value of a piece of music according to how much of it could be counted, calculated, and expressed in formulas:  how absurd would such a \\"scientific\\" estimation of music be!  What would one have comprehended, understood, grasped of it?  Nothing, really nothing of what is \\"music\\" in it!<br /><br />Political existentialism in this book might be associated with realizing that anything people respond to is more mythological than reasoned thought.  The Antichrist appears in the index with the note, \\"see also devil, Mephistopheles, Satan\\" (p. 343), and associating Nietzsche with the Antichrist works as well for McCormick as his note 85 to support the memory of Carl Schmitt \\"as the Mephistopheles of Weimar Germany.\\"  (p. 116).<br /><br />My Senator Norm Coleman (R-WH) was able to win an election by picturing liberals as standing in the way of whatever progress the United States might still be capable of achieving.  Schmitt is portrayed as leading the way for such ideas in Part II of this book, Liberalism as Technology's Infiltration of Politics.  Chapter 3, Emergency Powers, probably applies to locking people up right now about as well as when, \\"to address a large-scale political rebellion in the American Civil War, Abraham Lincoln was forced to stretch the traditional means of suspending habeas corpus far beyond reasonable limits,\\" (n. 38, p. 151), but when Schmitt supported it, it is seen as \\"the opportunity to those like Schmitt who would use this particular liberal deficiency as a ruse to scrap the whole legal order.  In this sense, Schmitt's leading sovereign can be seen as the violent return of the prerogative repressed by scientific liberalism.\\"  (p. 152).<br /><br />Viewing America as a global superpower has a certain dignity that hardly relates to the kind of dignity associated with Representation in Chapter 4, where, `If one grants to Schmitt the point that multinational corporations as the representatives of economic forces have less \\"dignity\\" than the Catholic Church as the representative of Jesus Christ and the whole of humanity, he still seems to glide over a major important difference between modern and medieval concepts of representation.'  (p. 165).  Political theology continues in Chapter 5, Law, in which, `But the peculiar situation of modernity that encourages what he calls in POLITICAL FORM \\"the antithesis of empty form and formless matter\\" results in a jurisprudence that has ultimately become form for form's sake.\\"  (p. 209).  \\"Even if the norms reflected in a formalist scheme of jurisprudence were to have some ethical resonance, Schmitt demonstrates that the system would nevertheless rob these norms of their substance in the process of application.\\"  (p. 217).  This is the kind of thing that only a fool would admit, or a deep thinker; take your pick.<br /><br />Chapter 6, The State, is a philosophy clear to Thomas Hobbes.  `As Hobbes remarked, \\"The Passion to be reckoned upon, is fear\\" [Leviathan I, 14]' (pp. 249-250).

It has a fill in the blanks approach to problems that frequently calls for writing in a journal to provide participants in this activity with sufficient space for sustained reflection.  Psychology gets kicked around a lot on an intellectual level by people who would like to think that some other thinker has all the answers, but this book modestly subtitles itself as Simple, Effective Techniques for Overcoming Traumatic Stress Symptoms.  The book was being compiled when the events of September 11, 2001, gave the authors a sense of urgency that the civilized world needed to have this particular road to recovery spelled out more clearly than ever.  My first impression is that the attempt to summarize various steps in the recovery process has produced some surprisingly poetic statements.  The best example:<br /><br />\\"An Aside about Suicide\\"  (p. 143).<br /><br />That is well placed after the \\"Emotional Boundaries\\" section which starts on page 141.  Pithy little thoughts that are meant to elicit extreme reactions are actually called for in the section called \\"The Trigger Mapping Ladder.\\"  (pp. 62, 64).  Get ready for \\"Exercise:  How I Numb\\"  (p. 71).  Pages 79-84 cover \\"Techniques for Sleeping.\\"  Philosophers who seem to lack experience in practical matters should try working through Chapter 7, Dealing with Associated Symptoms of PTSD:  Guilt, Survivor Guilt, Shame, and Loss (pp. 106-122).  I was particularly struck by the belief, \\"I am not allowed to be seen or heard.\\"  (p. 117).	2005-08-14

Scott Fitzgerald	This book illustrates one facet of F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing, which is based on his sensitivity to his family's financial situation, which was not quite what the top social strata in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Chicago, Illinois, New York City, or at Princeton University considered enviable.  In August 1916, the summer after Fitzgerald left Princeton, he saw Ginevra King in Lake Forest, Illinois and someone there told him, \\"Poor boys shouldn't think of marrying rich girls.\\"  (p. 61, 62).  The subtitle describes Ginevra as his first love, but they rarely saw each other, and the major literary contribution to this book by Ginevra is a story on pages 51-56 in which they can finally get together for a perfect hour after she has already married a Russian count and he remarks, \\"My wife ought to be home directly!\\"--  (p. 56).  Among the parallels to THE GREAT GATSBY pointed out in this book, I was most impressed that \\"Fairway Flapper\\" Edith Cummings, who won the U.S. Women's Amateur tennis title in 1923, was a friend of Ginevra with an identical pinky ring and obviously the original for character Jordan Baker in THE GREAT GATSBY.<br /><br />Fitzgerald wrote a tremendous number of letters to Ginevra, but we don't have them.  Before he destroyed the letters Ginevra sent him, he had a typed transcript made, 227 double-spaced pages, and kept it in a ring binder.  After his death, the transcript was returned to Ginevra King Pirie after she had married John T. Pirie, Jr., who would become chairman of the department store, Carson, Pirie, Scott & Co.  Surprisingly few original sources are actually quoted in this book, THE PERFECT HOUR, by James L. W. West III.<br /><br />They knew each other about a year before Ginevra wrote to Scott on January 31, 1916, \\"Honestly and truly, it would be wonderful to have that perfect hour, sometime, someday and somewhere.\\"  (pp. xiii, 50).  Ginevra's diary entry for Monday, January 4, 1915, when they met.  (p. 21, 22).  Place cards from a party, preserved by Scott in his scrapbook.  (p. 23). Her diary entries for January 5, 14 and 15.  (p. 25).  Draft of a telegram written by Scott on a train with a shaky hand.  (p. 26).  Diary entries for January 23, 28, and February 6 and 12, and letter she wrote him on February 7.  (p. 26).  Her first letter, written on January 11, and letter of October 13.  (p. 27).  Her letter of January 11 and 25.  (p. 28, 29-30).  By January 29 she wrote, \\"I want you to apologize for calling me a vampire.  (p. 31).  Letter of January 20 and telegram of February 6.  (p. 31).  Letters of January 25 and February 8.  (p. 33).  Letters of January 29 and April 4.  (p. 34).  Letter of February 8 and diary on February 20.  (pp. 35-36).  Letter of March 10.  (pp. 36-37).  Letters of February 25 and March 12.  (p. 37).  Letters of March 12 and 25 and diary for March 16.  (p. 38).  Letters of March 25 and 26 and April 26.  (p. 39).  Diary for June 8 (pp. 40-41) and letter of August 25 stating, \\"I told you, didn't I, that I figured out that we have seen each other for exactly 15 hours.\\"  (p. 40).  Letter of May 14 and \\"She would turn seventeen in November;\\"  (p. 43).  All of this has been about a high school girl?  So she could go to the Yale-Princeton football game in New Haven in November 1915, so the next letter of January 27 must be 1916.  (p. 44).  Fitzgerald had written a Princeton University Triange Club show with future literary critic Edmund Wilson, and Ginevra saw two performances in Chicago and sent him a letter on January 17, 1916.  (p. 45).  She also wrote a letter May 22 about getting kicked out of school for leaning out the windows of the dormitory to talk to boys.  (p. 48).<br /><br />The remainder of the book furnishes details about stories by F. Scott Fitzgerald, after her wedding march to Rolls-Royce to large grand piano story.  After Scott sent her a story, she wrote him on May 24.  (p. 61).  The \\"Poor boys shouldn't think of marrying rich girls\\" in Scott's ledger is on page 62, with \\"It would be slick to have you write a story about me,\\" she told him on November 3rd.  The romance was over by the end of January, 1917.  (p. 64).  She announced an engagement to the son of a bank president who was an ensign in naval aviation on July 16, 1918.  They were married September 4, 1918, just a few months before she was twenty.  An exciting robbery during a dinner party on the evening of Saturday, November 21, 1931, involving four armed thieves (p. 81) was thwarted and most of her jewelry was recovered inside the pockets of an overcoat that had snagged on a wire fence.  (p. 82).  She lived until 1980.<br /><br />There are a few times in the book when privacy issues are raised, but most of the events in the book take place when Ginevra King was too young to be allowed to get into trouble, and the thrill is all about trying to get things down on paper.  There are so many people in modern society that few of them ever develop much sense of who they are talking to.  Scott had Ginevra's attention long enough to help define who he wanted to address and why.  But he could never write for enough money to put him in her class.  Scott and Zelda were spending as fast as it came to them and never could have caught up.  There is an intellectual problem here, but it looks more emotional than economic.age 62, with \\"It would be slick to have you write a story about me,\\" she told him on November 3rd.

A key word is prion, a protein that might form part of the membrane of a normal cell.  Originally in this book, prion was defined by Stanley Prusiner, winner of the Nobel Prize in 1997, in 1982 as the carrier of the infection for TSEs.  \\"Prions are small proteinaceous infectious particles which are resistant to inactivation by most procedures that modify nucleic acids.\\"  (p. 100).  Forming rods in a polymer structure, ultimately doctors, \\"when examining brain tissue from kuru patients, had been able to recognize what they called amyloid plaques\\" (pp. 101-102).<br /><br />Assuming that any cow in England which showed signs of bovine spongiform encephalopathy was an indication that the entire herd had been fed contaminated meat and bone meal, (from \\"forty-six British plants that until 1988 had converted a total of 1.3 million metric tons of meat and bones into animal feed\\" p. 147), \\"the total number of cattle affected by the disease from the beginning of the epidemic until the end of 2000 was nearly two hundred thousand in Great Britain,\\" (p. 151).  Since the cow form of the disease and the sheep form act differently in mice who are infected, a grand experimental test was performed to see if any sheep have picked up the BSE form:<br /><br />\\"In the summer of 2001, rumors began to circulate to the effect that the BSE agent had been found in sheep; the official outcome was to be announced at the end of the year.  Europe's health authorities were in a state of red alert.  If the results were positive, drastic steps would have to be taken in the sheep-farming sector.  Then, just two days before the outcome was made public, there was a dramatic announcement:  The researchers had made a mistake.  They had mingled samples of sheep brains with samples of cattle brains--and thus there are still no data on the possible transmission of BSE to sheep in natural conditions.\\"  (p. 188).<br /><br />I have noticed that when people try to assign unique numbers to anything, there is always someone who fails to notice that two of those numbers are not the same.  I have even worked with a computer that had so few consecutive numbers in a field that it was not able to tell the difference between numbers that had more than the number of digits in the field.  There are forty million sheep in Britain, few of which look like cows, even in that night in which all cows are black, but worse than that: the brain samples might look a lot like brain samples from a cow.  This experiment was more than double blind if no one kept tract of how samples were mingled.<br /><br />I love the word epizootic:  \\"Why was an epizootic--an animal epidemic--declared at one particular time, the early 1980s, and only in the United Kingdom?\\"  (p. 189).  It must be related to \\"the death of six white tigers from the Bristol zoo between 1970 and 1977; they died of what was then diagnosed as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, but no one knows what became of the corpses. . . .

Nietzsche expressed a contrary view, possibly more ancient than modern, which applied far more accurately to the pre-Platonic Greeks, that there is no philosophy, only philosophers.  For those whose idea of meaning depends mainly on context, Schopenhauer must now be evaluated primarily in what he was able to learn from Kant, how he reacted to his contemporary Hegel, and whether he deserved the repudiation which Nietzsche eventually expressed as a sign of triumph over the denial of will lying in the heart of Schopenhauer's philosophy.  I have the big major volumes of Schopenhauer's philosophy, but I was hoping to find more when I checked the shelf in a used book store and found something tiny by Michael Tanner called SCHOPENHAUER / Metaphysics and Art (1997, 1999).<br /><br />There is too much of Schopenhauer's work to expect a short explanation of all of it.  He wrote at such great length on so many topics that the 54 pages of Michael Tanner's book would only be valuable as a summary of a particular aspect that is important for distinguishing Schopenhauer from the other thinkers with which he has become inextricably entwined in the minds of readers whose approach to philosophy has not been as systematic as the great books approach.  My own interest would be more perverse than usual because I would like to find, somewhere in the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860), some indication that his interest in music was in some way on the upskirts of rock 'n' roll, even when he is writing, \\"No one has kept so free from this mistake as Rossini; hence his music speaks its own language so distinctly and purely that it requires no words at all, and produces its full effect even when rendered by instruments alone.\\"  (pp. 48-49).<br /><br />Schopenhauer playing flute by himself for several hours a day is probably the opposite of the kind of music appreciation of modern youngsters who expect to hear, \\"Let's party, let's get down.  Turn the radio on, this is the meltdown\\" as in Sheryl Crow's \\"There Goes the Neighborhood\\" song.  Schopenhauer was not even a seminar type thinker, as Michael Tanner seems to expect whenever a universal truth stated by Schopenhauer does not conform to our modern reduction of philosophy to a group discussion format in which individuals take turns expressing points of view.  Since Plato, philosophy has been adept at condemning the poets and trying to think in ways that speak with more validity than music, so what do you expect?  I think Michael Tanner blames Schopenhauer for indicating that music says more than philosophy, when Schopenhauer's main point of view would then be foolish:<br /><br />This tiresome need of art to be `truthful', when the truth is disgusting, is what Nietzsche only came to free himself from -- granted his general outlook -- late in life when he wrote (and then only in a notebook):  `We have art in order that we may not perish of truth.  Truth is ugly.'  Why didn't Schopenhauer say the same?  (p. 47).<br /><br />I must say that I was highly impressed by the first page of this book, which mentioned THE WORLD AS WILL AND REPRESENTATION and Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON with \\"he espoused some of its key doctrines, and it is necessary to grasp them to see how Schopenhauer moved on, as he saw it, from them to his own highly idiosyncratic position.\\"  Pages 2 and 3 trace the fundamental problem back to David Hume, and the beginning of THE WORLD AS WILL AND REPRESENTATION is quoted on pages 5-6.  Pages 9-11 quote the second chapter of Book IIfor the inner nature of the individual for whom \\"The act of will and the action of the body are not two different states objectively known, . . .\\"  At the end of the second book, Schopenhauer has a position of \\"Eternal becoming, endless flux, belong to the revelation of the essential nature of the will.\\"  (p. 16).  In Volume II, in a chapter called `Characterization of the Will-to-Live', most unfortunately, \\"everyone perseveres in such a mock existence as long as he possibly can\\"  (p. 18).<br /><br />Finally Richard Wagner, Tolstory, Thomas Mann, Hardy, and Conrad are mentioned as having \\"a strong satisfaction in having what they regard as the necessary, inescapable misery of life so lucidly conveyed.\\"  (p. 19).  Book III gives us:<br /><br />\\"Thus the subject of willing is constantly lying on the revolving wheel of Ixion, is always drawing water in the sieve of the Danaids, and is the eternally thirsting Tantalus.\\"  (p. 20).<br /><br />Then a discussion of earthly happiness and pain quotes pages with particular sentences examined to find \\"this is more of the registering of a tendency than the statement of a universal truth, and it is certainly not a necessary or conceptual truth.\\"  (p. 28).<br /><br />On the upskirts of rock 'n' roll, Michael Tanner observes \\"that the way in which we usually appreciate music, when we are concerned with it from the point of view of emotional expression, is something that we value because it, at best, takes us into the deepest recesses of our empirical selves, the selves which maintain a constant attempt to remain sharply individuated.  So whatever the truth about music, how and even if it is expressive, it can't be expressive of ultimate reality.\\"  (p. 51).

His references to Vietnam only produced three entries in the index, for \\"Over the next five months, I traveled to South Korea, Vietnam, and Indonesia to report for Pacifica.  When I got back to the United States in January 2004, I talked to my editors about the possibility of returning to Iraq.\\"  (p. 88).  My Freudian interest in such reality makes it a prelude for nightmarish hallucination, as in  \\"Sitting on my balcony, drinking beer, I looked out past date palms and the Tigris River toward the Green Zone.  I saw an American helicopter take flight.  Suddenly, I was transported in my mind back to Vietnam in the mid-1970s.\\"  (p. 222).  Reality returns with  \\"The next day, U.S. Marines launched a fresh assault on Fallujah, sending in air strikes and tanks.

Iraq might have been a great civilization at some point, but recent reports make it sound like a river of raw sewage runs through it.  Certainly Glantz reports fresh bomb craters already full of raw sewage in Fallujah.  If I ever saw muddy water in a bomb crater in Nam, I assumed the rain was to blame.  I thought American strategy in Nam was:  let the kids handle it.  Median age of American troops in Nam was nineteen for years because of troop rotation policies that let the Army pretend that a two-year draftee obligation could provide the necessary manpower.  Bernard Fall thought it was like a comic book war, with \\"Charlie zapped a slick\\" vernacular matching the mentality of a generation raised on entertainment fantasies, never prone to observe we were ending UP with very little reality to show for it.<br /><br />Iraq seems more like a grown-UP war in the worst possible sense.  Making the spread of democracy the political policy hardly matches the complaints of Iraqis that America has tried to maximize the amount of oil pumped, but has not managed to provide things like jobs, clean water, electricity, and suitable wastewater treatment for maintaining a civilized existence.  Sanctions were perverse because they were supposed to keep the amount of oil being pumped to a minimum, and the authorities monitoring how sanctions worked, the U.N., France, and Russia, were able to find ways to restrict contracts to benefit themselves, as my senator, Norm Coleman (R-WH), soon discovered when he was given the power to investigate.  Saddam had air defenses which were capable of locking in radar on American and British planes which could bomb whatever military installations they found to be threatening, a much more grown-UP situation than in Nam, where even Robert McNamara never (Yes, Bob, I'm talking about August 1964) asserted that North Vietnam's PT-boats had locked in radar on American destroyers.  Stop loss orders for American troops who might be needed until terror ends has the potential to make American forces the aging group of jacked-UP warriors that the young people who did not want to go to Nam in the 1960s could picture staying away from by listening to Jefferson Airplane's song \\"Good Shepard\\" on blood stained banners and long-time liars.<br /><br />I mention Jefferson Airplane because I am trying to be nice in leading into what I would like to say about the democratic intellectual activity level of former heroes (people loved `White Rabbit') who are barking up the wrong tree.  My idea of an UP-dated spelling rule would be:<br /><br />i before e except after c<br /><br />and when pronounced like weigh<br /><br />as in neighbor and McVeigh.<br /><br />Tim received a bronze star for shooting an Iraqi (at 1000 meters with a .50 caliber machine gun) in our first gulfwar.

I was reading a book by Hannah Arendt at the beginning of July, when I went to a Bo Diddley concert in which his song \\"Shut Up, Woman\\" ended with \\"You know I love you, and I would love you twice as much if you put that razor away.\\"  I was primarily interested in what Arendt could say about Nietzsche, but her observations also included Marx and Kierkegaard.  Arendt was a member of the last generation that was well-read.  Since then reading has become an individual hobby for some, but books are no longer a context within which meaning advances, and her observations shaved off the B.C. comic suggestion for males proving their superiority over females by scratching them with our beards.<br /><br />Do we all remember this comic?<br /><br />We're going to catch the women and prove the innate superiority of men over women.<br /><br />Curls:  How do you plan to do that?<br /><br />Peter:  We'll scratch them with our beards.<br /><br />Hannah Arendt might be a good example of how modern exercises in political thought think very much like Nietzsche, but use Nietzsche as the philosopher most responsible for ending the authority which thought itself, as a superfluous product of human mental aspiration, assumes in her book, BETWEEN PAST AND FUTURE.  Its index of names does not include George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans, 1819-80, dead now these 125 years), an English author that Nietzsche heard about from his friend, Helene Druscowicz, and mentioned in section 5 of the \\"Expeditions of an Untimely Man\\" in Nietzsche's book TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS with the disavowal, \\"let us not blame it on little bluestockings a la Eliot.  In England, in response to every little emancipation from theology one has to reassert one's position in a fear-inspiring manner as a moral fanatic.\\"  People being what they are, morals ought to assume an awe-inspiring place in the expression of anyone's individuality.  For Nietzsche to assume that \\"it possesses truth only if God is truth - it stands or falls with the belief in God\\" applies religious presumptions to a matter that holds no water, \\"For the Englishman morality is not yet a problem . . .\\"  I tried to find something about Marx in Nietzsche's books, and instead I found an English novelist who might be familiar to anyone who reads.<br /><br />To let Hannah Arendt state the matter in her own way:<br /><br />\\"Kierkegaard, Marx, and Nietzsche remained Hegelians insofar as they saw the history of past philosophy as one dialectically developed whole; their great merit was that they radicalized this new approach toward the past in the only way it could still be further developed, namely, in questioning the conceptual hierarchy which had ruled Western philosophy since Plato and which Hegel had still taken for granted.\\"<br /><br />George Eliot did not get mentioned when Hannah Arendt considered the way in which modern society functions:<br /><br />\\"Values are social commodities that have no significance of their own but, like other commodities, exist only in the ever-changing relativity of social linkages and commerce.  Through this relativization both the things which man produces for his use and the standards according to which he lives undergo a decisive change:  they become entities of exchange, and the bearer of their `value' is society and not man, who produces and uses and judges.\\"<br /><br />Considering the common element of self-defeat in Nietzsche, Marx, and Kierkegaard, Arendt suggests, \\"In complete independence of one another--none of them ever knew of the others' existence--they arrive at the conclusion that this enterprise in terms of the tradition can be achieved only through a mental operation best described in the images and similes of leaps, inversions, and turning concepts upside down:  Kierkegaard speaks of his leap from doubt into belief; Marx turns Hegel, or rather `Plato and the whole Platonic tradition' (Sidney Hook), `right side up again,' leaping `from the realm of necessity into the realm of freedom'; and Nietzsche understands his philosophy as `inverted Platonism' and `transformation of all values.'\\"<br /><br />Freedom is a neat theme because it allows everyone to participate as liberators.  Even the CIA is still looking for a slam dunk way to make it happen, but the future is never a cakewalk.  Education has been trying to produce people who can reach some consensus on things that have to be done, but the methods which lead in that direction are incredibly boring to anyone who has access to the feelings of those who produce and perform art.

NUTRITION FOR LIFE admits that being overweight can be a big problem, and that high blood pressure (defined on page 214 as greater than 140/90mmHg) is one problem that is directly related to having a body mass that overwhelms the cardiovascular system often enough to make cardiovascular disease the number one killer in North America.  I am old enough, heavy enough, male and interested enough in the future to notice that whole grains, nuts, seeds, and dry beans are supposed to be good for this condition.  The word \\"Potassium\\" appears five times on page 220, which also has a chart showing serving sizes, like three and a half oz. (100g) cooked meat, for The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH).  Sticking to this diet is supposed to be effective enough to reduce \\"diastolic blood pressure (the lower measurement of blood pressure, taken between heartbeats when the heart is relaxed) by up to 5mmHg,\\"  (p. 220).  The DASH diet is effective for people with high blood pressure that ranged from 140/90 to 159/99mmHg.  If I exercised more, my blood pressure might drop to that range someday, right?<br /><br />The Food Analysis charts at the end of the book start with grain, and a cup of cooked bulgar has only 151 kcal but 8.2 grams of fiber, so making a bowl of Tabbouleh according to the recipe on the whole grain bulgar cracked wheat package (keeps best refrigerated or frozen) I bought today seemed like a nice experiment, using my imagination and baby spinach leaves because I did not have 3 cups finely minced Parsley.  I'm sure people eat this stuff because I have gone to restaurants that had a bowl bigger than any of mine in the salad section.  Even Parsley, freeze-dried, is on the food chart with 4 kcal, though a quarter cup does not have a gram of anything tabulated.  The index on pages 328-335 helps locate foods in the chart.  Trying to find why bananas would be my ideal food is not easy just using the Index, unless I look up blood-sugar levels, which is also a problem for me, and the glycemic index does not say anything about bananas.  I want the next page, about soluble fiber, gut flora, and the feeling of fullness caused by fiber-rich foods.  This tells me what page to look for to learn how a high-fiber diet helps prevent diabetes.  The Diabetes Meal Planner on page 249 suggests half a medium banana at breakfast, yogurt for a snack in the morning, but \\"If you would like a small glass of 100 percent juice, skip the fruit.\\"  As a final try, the index has a few entries for potassium (K).  Men and women need 3,500mg per day.  Good sources include potatoes, spinach, and red meat, but bananas might give me enough potassium to help lower and control blood pressure.  Bananas also have chromium (Cr), which \\"helps insulin bind to its receptors on the membrane of body cells, which then allows for the sugar glucose to move into the cell where it is used to produce energy for the cell's needs.\\"  (p. 65).<br /><br />In the section of the book on vitamins, there is a picture of bananas with the caption:<br /><br />\\"Bananas  A particularly good source of vitamin B6, bananas also provide folate, potassium, and soluble fiber.  They are best eaten ripe--when the skin is speckled brown.\\"  (p. 55).sing the Index, unless I look up blood-sugar levels, which is also a problem for me, and the glycemic index does not say anything about bananas.

US	41560427	R3UPOGKC6EZARJ	0520220579	684018913	Hannah Arendt in Jerusalem	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Very satisfying on an emotional level	HANNAH ARENDT IN JERUSALEM has 21 chapters, plus a preface and introduction, which provide papers from a conference held in Jerusalem between December 9 and December 11, 1997, 22 years after her death.  Notes on the papers on pages 347-420 contain information which has not been included in the index on pages 425-428.  Scholars have multiple points of view on how well she managed to tune in to the issues which made the twentieth century so exciting.  I appreciate Arendt for her ability to derive lessons from Nietzsche that exceed my own powers of observation, but the middle of this book has 180 pages between mentions of Nietzsche, though these pages contain a chapter on The Intellectual Background by Hans Mommsen (an expert on German history and literature) called \\"Hannah Arendt's Interpretation of the Holocaust as a Challenge to Human Existence\\" (pp. 224-231).  She was prone to emphasize what she had already written in THE ORIGINS OF TOTALITARIANISM when she went to Jerusalem for the Eichmann trial, a politically inept location for observing that \\"the Nazi machinery of destruction successfully turned the criminal activities involved into routine procedures that suffocated any moral protest, either from bystanders or from those who were induced to become perpetrators,\\" (p. 231).  Hans Mommsen was afraid that this context \\"inevitably created the erroneous impression that she intended to express contempt for the court itself.\\"  (p. 230).<br /><br />Other contributors to this book who spent countless hours reading the books of letter to and from Hannah Arendt have no difficulty documenting that, as Walter Laqueur admitted, \\"The animosity toward Jews as a group was of long standing, and it was by no means restricted to Israel and the Israelis. . . .  Perhaps she had read too much anti-Semitic literature for her own good.\\"  (p. 58).  Walter Laqueur's comments on Hannah Arendt as political commentator and \\"the greatest female philosopher of our time, perhaps of all times, which she might well be\\" (p. 49) find \\"a fascinating discrepancy between Arendt the political philosopher and the poverty of her judgment concerning current politics.\\"  (p. 50).  Comparing Arendt to Raymond Aron, \\"As a political thinker, he was at least her equal, and his political judgment was infinitely better than hers.  He was usually right, and she was often wrong.  The list of alleged fools in Hannah Arendt's letters is truly enormous.\\"  (p. 62).  A review by Raymond Aron in 1954 picked the element of her work that has become so dominant, \\"without being aware of it, Mrs. Arendt affects a tone of haughty superiority regarding things and men.\\"  (p. 61).<br /><br />The final four chapters of HANNAH ARENDT IN JERUSALEM examine her relationship with the philosophers Karl Jaspers and Martin Heidegger.  The chapter by Anson Rabinbach is mainly about a book by Jaspers in 1946 which appeared in English as THE QUESTION OF GERMAN GUILT.  Germans did not embrace the idea.  Arendt's husband complained, \\"despite all beauty and nobility, the guilt brochure of Jaspers is a damned and Hegelized, Christian-pietist-sanctimonious nationalizing bilge.\\"  (p. 300).<br /><br />Peter Baehr considers Arendt, Jaspers, and the appraisal of Max Weber primarily in the context of a letter on January 1, 1933, in which Arendt wrote:<br /><br />\\"But I am obligated to keep my distance, I can neither be for nor against when I read Max Weber's wonderful sentence where he says that to put Germany back on her feet he would form an alliance with the devil himself.\\"  (p. 308).<br /><br />Finding some theological applications, Arendt wrote a moral evaluation:<br /><br />\\". . . it is not so certain that those who have lost their belief in Hell as a place of the hereafter may not be willing to be able to establish on earth exact imitations of what people used to believe about Hell.\\"  (p. 319).<br /><br />As Peter Baehr concludes, something strange about the mixture of issues involved in communication iscomplex:<br /><br />\\"That some of the most profound forms of expression and dialogue do not conform to norms of transparency, `sincerity,' and consistency may offend some philosophers.  But it may also add weight to Arendt's suspicion that philosophy and human experience are constantly at war.\\"  (p. 324).<br /><br />Steven Aschheim, in the Introduction, quotes a letter Arendt wrote to Jaspers on April 13, 1961, in which she complained about Jerusalem:<br /><br />\\"Everything is organized by a police force that gives me the creeps, speaks only Hebrew and looks Arabic.  Some downright brutal types among them.  They would follow any order.\\"  (p. 7).<br /><br />The contribution by Susan Neiman, called \\"Theodicy in Jerusalem\\" (pp. 65-90), coincides quite closely with an entry in the index for Immanuel Kant, 68-84, and illustrates Arendt's mix of ideas quite vividly:<br /><br />\\"In other words, you don't have to be a student of Heidegger to be ambivalent about philosophy.  Arendt's strongest expression of revulsion toward the subject occurs in discussing the intellectual embrace of Nazism:  Precisely the capacity to use well-trained wit to provide interesting rationalizations of Nazism made philosophy permanently suspect.  But in just the discussion in which, for these reasons, she most vehemently rejects her interviewer's inclination to call her a philosopher, Arendt undercuts her own position.  Defending her claim to have bid farewell to philosophy, she appeals to what she calls philosophy's essential hostility to the political--from which she immediately excepts Kant (Gaus, V, 45).  Later she would generalize to describe Kant as `so singularly free of all specifically philosophical vices' (T, 83).  Be that as it may, this is fairly respectable company to keep for one who insists she has said farewell to philosophy.\\"  (p. 73).<br /><br />Heidegger is such a giant in philosophy that Arendt is able to see his escape from concrete politics into a more philosophical approach than the \\"interesting rationalizations of Nazism\\" in 1933 which have become such a large part of Heidegger's reputation.

The text was created by a few people who got together on a number of occasions.  Things that are numbered have a lot of firsts on a single page, particularly on page 47, where the topology of being is imagined with three aspects:<br /><br />Three terms which succeed one another and at the same time indicate three steps along the way of thinking:  MEANING -- TRUTH -- PLACE . . .<br /><br />First, truth. . . .<br /><br />First, what does \\"meaning\\" signify?  Meaning in BEING AND TIME is defined in terms of a project region, and projection is the accomplishment of Dasein, which means the ek-static instancy in the openness of being.  By ek-sisting, Dasein includes meaning.  The thinking that proceeds from BEING AND TIME, in that it gives up the word \\"meaning of being\\" in favor of \\"truth of being,\\" henceforth emphasizes the openness of being itself, rather than the openness of Dasein in regard to this openness of being.<br /><br />This signifies \\"the turn,\\" in which thinking always more decisively turns to being as being.<br /><br />The statements above are taken from 23 lines of text.  I have omitted a Greek word for place and a German word for instancy.  The ek- form of words pops up so frequently that I noticed a Greek instance on page 54:<br /><br />What for Aristotle was a development [Auseinanderfolge] (the result of an emerging out of; ek-eis), becomes a succession [Aufeinanderfolge] (through the determination of the result as sequential) -- this due to the fact that the first idea is only an \\"occult quality,\\" brought into disrepute by the Cartesians, though nevertheless rehabilitated in a certain sense by Leibniz.<br /><br />This book does not have an index or translation of most Greek terms, but glossaries (pp. 113-118) of German-English and English-German correspondence allow those who are sure of a meaning in one language to check for which word this corresponds to in the other translation.  The seminars in 1966, 1968, 1969, and 1973 took place in French, and the German translator, Curd Ochwadt, provides an Afterword with a poem by Martin Heidegger in German which is translated in a note on page 112.

Having purchased the Great Books Volume 39 on Kant earlier this year, which was an economical collection that included his three most famous volumes as well as Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals (1785) and Preface and Introduction to the Metaphysical Elements of Ethics translated by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott, which are works that Kant's THE METAPHYSICS OF MORALS in the Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy does not include, it is interesting to see how these two books still manage to overlap.<br /><br />The Great Books Kant includes a translation (1887) by W. Hastie of Kant's 1797 works General Introduction to the Metaphysic of Morals (pp. 383-394) and The Science of Right (pp. 395-458).  This book contains Mary Gregor's translation of the same text on pages 1-124.<br /><br />Since Abraham Lincoln was President of the United States in 1861-65, Americans have tended to think that everybody who was important to us would be living in the same country, and democracy would allow the majority to dictate the basic laws which everyone would have to adhere to.  Kant has to come up with rules for wars between states that need to maintain a balance of power, but his result is to deny economic motives.  \\"The reason there cannot be a war of subjugation is not that this extreme measure a state might use to achieve a condition of peace would in itself contradict the right of a state; it is rather that the idea of the right of nations involves only the concept of an antagonism in accordance with principles of outer freedom by which each can preserve what belongs to it, but not a way of acquiring, by which one state's increase of power could threaten others.\\"  (section 56, p. 117).  A written constitution ought to be more powerful than treaties \\"which can be dissolved at any time, not a federation (like that of the American states) which is based on a constitution and can therefore not be dissolved.\\"  (section 61, p. 120).<br /><br />Somehow Kant lacked the idea that heads of state would regularly be deprived of their rule and punished for official acts.  \\"The sovereign can also take the ruler's authority away from him, depose him, or reform his administration.  But it cannot punish him . . .; for punishment is, again, an act of the executive authority, which has the supreme capacity to exercise coercion in conformity with the law, and it would be self-contradictory for him to be subject to coercion.\\"  (section 49, p. 94).  If the ultimate weapons wipe out life on the planet, we would find ourselves in a condition already imagined by Kant:<br /><br />\\"Accordingly, every murderer--anyone who commits murder, orders it, or is an accomplice in it -- must suffer death; this is what justice, as the idea of judicial authority wills in accordance with universal laws that are grounded a priori. -- If, however, the number of accomplices (correi) to such deed is so great that the state, in order to have no such criminals in it, could soon find itself without subjects; and if the state still does not want to dissolve, that is, to pass over into the state of nature, which is far worse because there is no external justice at all in it (and if it especially does not want to dull the people's feeling by the spectacle of a slaughterhouse), then the sovereign must also have it in his power, in this case of necessity (casus necessitatis), to assume the role of judge (to represent him) and pronounce a judgment that decrees for the criminals a sentence other than capital punishment, such as deportation, which still preserves the population.  This cannot be done in accordance with public law but it can be done by an executive decree that is, by an act of majesty which, as clemency, can always be exercised only in individual cases.\\"  (section 49, pp. 107-108).<br /><br />Kant died over 200years ago, unaware that economic interests could become so powerful that even the media would act as a single unit and find itself dedicated to perpetuating a power elite that could always, in each and every instance, join with leaders committed to mindlessly militaristic politics that used statistics on gross hyperconsumption to make itself fiscally worse than worthless, deporting jobs, cutting government programs to prepare for a lean and mean future in which worthless i.o.u.s would compete with other countries that still possessed natural resources and productive capacity, as if nothing could be better than to make democratic government as powerless as possible.<br /><br />In a reply to a reviewer of Kant's book, Kant pointed out, \\"that there is a categorical imperative, Obey the authority who has power over you (in whatever does not conflict with inner morality) -- this is the offensive proposition called into question.\\"  (p. 136).  Part II of this book, called Metaphysical First Principles of the Doctrine of Virtue (pp. 139-232), has a Preface in which, \\"Hence all doctrine of virtue, in lecture halls, from pulpits, or in popular books, also becomes ridiculous if it is decked out in scraps of metaphysics.  --But it is not useless, much less ridiculous, to investigate in metaphysics . . .\\"  (p. 141).  Maxims and duty are discussed in the Introduction, along with \\"a categorical imperative of pure practical reason, and therefore an imperative which connects a concept of duty with that of an end in general.\\"  (p. 149).  There are 53 sections and a conclusion on religion being beyond pure moral philosophy.  The index on pages 235-241 has few names, but suggests a few pages to check for topics like hypocrisy and ridicule.over 200 years ago, unaware that economic interests could become so powerful that even the media would act as a single unit and find itself dedicated to perpetuating a power elite that could always, in each and every instance, join with leaders committed to mindlessly militaristic politics that used statistics on gross hyperconsumption to make itself fiscally worse than worthless, deporting jobs, cutting government programs to prepare for a lean and mean future in which worthless i.o.u.s would compete with other countries that still possessed natural resources and productive capacity, as if nothing could be better than to make democratic government as powerless as possible. <br /> <br />In a reply to a reviewer of Kant's book, Kant pointed out, \\"that there is a categorical imperative, Obey the authority who has power over you (in whatever does not conflict with inner morality) -- this is the offensive proposition called into question.\\"  (p. 136).

US	41560427	R3NL9F5LYIQLDQ	1561632155	945732440	My War With Brian	Books	5	2	5	N	N	True enough to be theologically astounding	Ted Rall is so outrageous that I would consider him the political writer whose comic supernatural powers allow him to do things that I can only talk about.  Until we get to philosophy, of course, where the intellectual death wish sweepstakes rears its ugly head in ways that are as intense as the feelings described in the 66 pages of MY WAR WITH BRIAN, an episode in junior high school that reflects American politics so well, you can forget the adults.  They haven't got a clue about anything.<br /><br />The theme is MY WAR WITH BRIAN is bullies, but Ted Rall seems outraged that Americans live in a society in which others rarely have the opportunity to do anything to help victims.  Close to the end of the book, Rall summarizes the situation with, \\"Actually, most conflicts are stupid and pointless, but they're impossible to avoid.  Given that hard reality, I figure that pacifism is impossible.\\"  And on the next page, \\"I guess I still believe in God.\\"  It establishes his opposition to hyper-masculinity so effectively, that his young age hardly subtracts from the wisdom of a supreme being allowing the right people to get revenge on the haughty, which might be the highest ideal our society will ever achieve.<br /><br />One of the characters who was under the most pressure is only in the introduction, shortly before Rall admits \\"reading the newspaper at age 5, Sartre at 8\\":<br /><br />\\"He had troubles with bullies, but his biggest problem in life was his father.  Dad was a Protestant minister, and he insisted that Bill follow in his footsteps.  Unfortunately, Bill thought . . .\\"<br /><br />You really don't want to know that part, and the most exciting part of the intellectual death wish sweepstakes was the awareness on the side of young people who have questions that no one can answer of all the things Bill and Ted Rall would be willing to put down on paper and publish, especially after Bill ends up in the one dead buddy category, which certainly seemed queer to people who thought that killing other people made more sense than self-destruction.  My dad was also a Protestant minister, but American society had made that such a simpleton's role that being \\"doomed to a life in the clergy\\" seemed a bit lame for anyone who was capable of accomplishing anything.  Like most intellectual death wish sweepstakes observations, this attempt to clarify the nature of American society is unlikely to be considered a major accomplishment, but it magnifies my admiration for Ted Rall.  He has paid his dues at the hemlock for Socrates altar, and all you have to do, to see how he did it, is to buy this book.ple who thought that killing other people made more sense than self-destruction.

With imaginary docudramas filling in the blanks of the lives of so many famous people in ways that fulfill the fantasies of millions of TV viewers, as well as the readers of historical novels, those who watch movies about Samson, and theologians who wonder what Adam and Eve ever saw in the forbidden fruit, it is a relief to be getting some actual documents from a famous romance.  Heidegger's fame was growing rapidly at the beginning of this book, and Hannah Arendt was bound to become known for paying attention.  The fiftieth item in this book, \\"Martin Heidegger for Hannah Arendt:  Five Poems,\\" ends with the short poems:<br /><br />Correspondence<br /><br />Godless is God<br /><br />alone, and no<br /><br />other thing--<br /><br />death first<br /><br />corresponds,<br /><br />to the ring<br /><br />of Being's poem,<br /><br />the first.<br /><br />DEATH<br /><br />Death is, in the world's own rhyme,<br /><br />Being's mountain chain.<br /><br />Death will evade what's yours and mine<br /><br />in the falling weight<br /><br />falling toward silence's tor,<br /><br />star of earth, nothing more.<br /><br />For the friend's friend (pp. 63-64, prior to a letter dated Febr. 15, 1950).<br /><br />Hannah Arendt responded in item 127, twenty years later, a few weeks after Heidegger sent her a poem about time, but trying to quote the earlier poem, from New York, on November 27, 1970:<br /><br />Dear Martin,<br /><br />For days, weeks, I have wanted to write to you, at least to tell you how much good your letter did me, your sympathy, the time poem as an aid to reflection.  Together with the other from many, many years ago<br /><br />Death is, in the world's design,<br /><br />Being's mountain chain.<br /><br />Death will evade what's yours and mine<br /><br />In the falling weight.<br /><br />Falling toward silence's tor,<br /><br />Star of earth, nothing more.  (p. 173).<br /><br />British users of the English language might know that tor is a hill.  Heinrich Blucher had died and a memorial service was held at Bard College on November 15.  Like soldiers in a time of mounting casualties, people of different ages often have unsettled feelings about death because which will survive is not obvious.  Hannah Arendt died in December, 1975, a few months before Heidegger's death in May, 1976.  The `Romeo and Juliet' ending of fifty years of being German, Jewish, or American thinkers, bound together by an interest in the years that offered multiple lessons to be learned on both sides, makes this a bit more interesting to me than the other collections of Hannah Arendt's Letters with Karl Jaspers, Mary McCarthy, Hermann Broch, Kurt Blumenfeld, and Heinrich Blucher.<br /><br />This book mentions Nietzsche or Heidegger's book about Nietzsche about a dozen times, but the interesting comments are in Hannah Arendt's tribute, \\"Martin Heidegger at eighty\\" on pages 148-162, and a brilliant short description of Heidegger as a fox in July 1953 which ends with:<br /><br />But the fox living in the trap said proudly:  So many fall into my trap; I have become the best of all foxes.  And there was even something true in that:  nobody knows the trap business better than he who has been sitting in a trap all his life.  (p. 305).<br /><br />Most of us could apply the trap business view to everything in life that requires our involvement.  Longing for a few ideas, we can pick up a book like this as the inside and outside view of an intellectual trap.  Lacking the ability to read this book all at once, I had bookmarks in several places for weeks at a time as my ability to comprehend was expanding to get a grip on what this book has to offer.  The Index is helpful for those who have particular interests.  Minor items like Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 32 in C minor are not to be found in the Index, however much it might have been on Heidegger's mind when he wrote his letter of April 12, 1950, listing Beethoven, opus 111 Adagio, Conclusion as an addressee on page 74 and thanking Hannah for the opportunity to listen to it:<br /><br />\\"And now, Hannah, you have, on top of everything, and with a loving word, also given me Beethoven's Opus 111.  Its sound has already become kin to the light I mentioned at the beginning of this letter.<br /><br />\\"Elfride returns your greeting and kiss with a happy heart and is glad you returned home safely.  Say hello to your dear husband from me.\\"  (p. 76).<br /><br />The index does not have an entry for Elfride Heidegger on page 76, but it did list page 74, where Heidegger wrote about \\"what is loving about love that cast its light into my room when Elfride and you embraced.  We will need time to make what has become of us our own:  That you came, that what grew close in us became the closest closeness; that Elfride was helpful with all of it, that our love needs her love; that everything, including your safe return home, is reflected, clarified, and validated in everything else.\\"<br /><br />I'm sure that Nietzsche wrote that a married philosopher, like Socrates, ought to be cast in some comedy, as Aristophanes did with Socrates in `The Clouds' in 423 B.C., a comedy which placed last in the competition with Cratinous and Ameipsias at the Great Dionysia in the month of March, 423 B.C.  Fortunately, Aristophanes revised his comedy, so \\"The Clouds' that we have today, \\"as purely farcical as the presentation of the philosopher himself suspended in a basket betwixt heaven and earth\\" in the notes for the Rogers translation, might be much better than running through it the first time.  Heidegger's opportunity in these LETTERS to get himself right all over again after five half decades had passed has a miraculous quality, to say the least.n he wrote his letter of April 12, 1950, listing Beethoven, opus 111 Adagio, Conclusion as an addressee on page 74 and thanking Hannah for the opportunity to listen to it: <br /> <br />\\"And now, Hannah, you have, on top of everything, and with a loving word, also given me Beethoven's Opus 111.

US	41560427	R2RHO9NZM2BTJ4	0972869298	478278145	Bacacay	Books	5	12	20	N	N	Like a fine punch; you might like other parts better	This 2004 translation from the Polish by Bill Johnston (Director of the Polish Studies Center at Indiana University) of the early stories of Witold Gombrowicz (1904-1969) begins with seven stories written between 1926 and 1932, which were originally published in 1933.  The other stories appeared in a collection published in Krakow in 1957.  After a scholarly edition appeared in 2002, as the first volume in a definitive edition of Gombrowicz's collected works, this fresh English translation based on that version is the most logical book to have for English readers interested in the literary beginnings of the great Polish novelist.  The Afterword by Bill Johnston provides enough background, revealed by Gombrowicz in POLISH MEMORIES, to picture Gombrowicz already trying to write novels, but only pleased with some brief pieces that \\"gave birth to some scene that was truly crazy, removed from the (healthy) expectations of mediocre logic, and yet firmly rooted in its own separate logic.\\"  (p. 271).<br /><br />Comedy is a poor excuse for claiming intellectual bondage to a thinker who died during an early stage in my lifetime, when I was totally preoccupied with other thinkers.  He studied law at Warsaw University and philosophy in France long before I was born, but the sequence seems to be appropriate to the subject matter of these stories and to the nature of my outlook as well.  Philosophy is a step in a peculiar direction for anyone who comes to the conclusion that justice is unlikely to be obtained in any matter in which the government has an interest, and this book starts with stories that make such an outlook something like an obsession.  The psychological compulsion which determines the activities of Gombrowicz's characters tops any other meaning that readers might attempt to find in these stories.<br /><br />The first, \\"Lawyer Kraykowski's Dancer,\\" certainly captures the motivations which made me decide that I wanted to attend Harvard Law School in 1968 before receiving my draft notice, so that two years later I would have no trouble returning to the first year classes with \\"a letter of recommendation from your commanding officer in the military, or the warden of your prison\\" as the Dean of students put it in his address to entering students who were not entitled to draft deferments as first-year graduate students in 1968.  As a prospective information looter and shooter, it seemed noble to me to allow the government to have the first few years in which I would be forming my opinions about government policies to put me wherever there was the greatest need for someone who had the intellectual capacity to observe what was going on and make a few guesses about what it was all about.  Having learned the military manner of shouting, I am particularly struck by the humiliation suffered by the narrating character in his first encounter with the Lawyer Kraykowski:<br /><br />\\"Was it you who did me the honor?\\" I asked in a tone that might have been ironic, perhaps even sinister, but since I suddenly came over weak, I said it too quietly.  (pp. 3-4).<br /><br />The plot has some cosmic moments, \\"as if all the forces in the world had gathered within me in a great frenzy\\" (p. 16), that people who are slaves to normal sensations might not recall.<br /><br />The second story even has a military element:<br /><br />Suddenly an artillery shell flew over, burst its sides, and exploded, blowing off both of Uhlan Kacperski's legs and tearing open his stomach; and Kacperski was at first confused, not grasping what had happened; then a moment later he also exploded, but in laughter; he was also bursting his sides, but with laughter!--holding his stomach, which was gushing blood like a fountain, he squealed and squealed in his comical, loud, hysterical, farcical high-pitched voice--for minutes on end!  How infectious that laugh was!  You have no idea what such an unexpected sound can be like on the field of battle.  I barely managed to survive till the end of the war.--And when I returned home I realized, my ears were still ringing with this laughter, that everything by which I had lived until then had crumbled into dust; . . . (p. 31).<br /><br />The third story, \\"A Premeditated Crime,\\" has an unexpected:<br /><br />\\"My husband,\\" she said dryly, turning to me, \\"died last night.\\"--What?!  So he was dead?  So that was it!  (p. 39).<br /><br />The first few hundred copies of Gombrowicz's stories included an explanation that in this story \\"the family loves the father, and he has not been murdered; and that in `Dinner at Countess Pavahoke's' the soup is not actually made from the runaway boy, but that the association is purely linguistic, and that `the point of the story is that the hunger and suffering of poor Bolek Cauliflower make the cauliflower-vegetable taste better to the aristocrats eating it.' \\"  (pp. 274-275).<br /><br />Readers of the novel FERDYDURKE might remember the stories \\"Philidor's Child Within\\" and \\"Philibert's Child Within,\\" which are freshly translated into English in this book \\"in an atmosphere of nail-biting tension and with endless spontaneous rounds of thunderous applause.\\"  (p. 212).<br /><br />The story \\"On the Kitchen Steps\\" is described as \\"written earlier but omitted from RECOLLECTIONS OF ADOLESCENCE out of consideration for the author's father, who Gombrowicz was afraid might read an allusion to himself in the story.\\"  (pp. 273-274).<br /><br />With so much \\"Mucky tricks!\\" (p. 224) and \\"Hee hee hee, hey diddle diddle, hey diddle diddle!\\" (p. 225) near the beginning, imagining his father shouting such things in his sleep and having his mother tell his father \\"And then you shouted--it was awful--about some sort of hey diddle diddle\\" (p. 228), only to find out:<br /><br />\\"Perhaps it was some recollections from my youth.  You know, I'm already growing old, and as one ages one recalls one's youth, like soup one had once, thirty years ago.\\"  (p. 229).<br /><br />So Gombrowicz wrote that in Polish once and finally had it published.

The circles which are the most obvious features of the design look like the eyes of needles made of concrete.  The concrete aqueduct which carries passenger boats through these circles are supported only at the outer edges, so it is possible for a camera to capture pictures of the sky or a distant hillside through the arc under the canal.  This is described as \\"the high-level Union Canal.\\"  (p. 62).  The Falkirk Wheel allows boats to be lowered to a basin leading into the Forth & Clyde Canal, part of a continuous waterway link between Scotland's east and west coast.  The visitor center at the lower ground level has windows that allow spectators to look up as the wheel rotates, observing a gear system that keeps each caisson containing water and boats level during the fifteen minute drop or lift.  Anyone expecting to see a lot of pictures of bridges and stadiums is likely to be surprised on pages 5-6 to see a shallow arched canal ending in mid-air, with the boat suspended in a container of water so close to the slanted windows of the building below that the shadow of everything is the most ominous clue that whatever is going on is not ordinary.<br /><br />People who have learned to work with computer aided design programs that figure out all the angles and lengths for unusual shapes might appreciate the number of calculations required for the Yokohama Port Terminal built in Japan in 2000-2002.  The index lists pictures on pages 13, 15, and 56-59.  On page 13 it is described as \\"a whole `landscape' of passenger concourses and external terraces has been created with a structure of folded steel beams.\\"  A ceiling that could be flat plates welded together is described as \\"Interior ramp with folded-plate beams above, typical of the complex, fluid spaces inside the building.\\"  (p. 59).<br /><br />The best roller-coaster pictures I have seen show the Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point Resort, Ohio, 2002-2003.  The tubular tower of yellow cylinders supports a red sectional steel trusses track that climbs 400 feet and twists 270 degrees as it falls vertically.  This has a snowy backdrop in the pictures on pages 159 and 164-165.

Sharpe, Inc., 2004) as RPE, and compare it to the free market in which everyone expects to get something for nothing due to the oversupply of expired patents, shared technologies, and the tendency of everything financial to expand to the point of collapse, which I shall call The Subversive Morbidity.<br /><br />RPE's Chapter 1 is about Marx.  It includes formulas for determining the total value of production.  Also, \\"Marx analyzed four tendencies that produced economic crisis.\\"  (p. 16).  Common today is what Marx called \\"the relative impoverishment of the working class.\\"  (pp. 17-18).  The Subversive Morbidity still rushes \\"to embrace a rich cultural being that included our artistic, intellectual, and spiritual abilities.\\"  (p. 18).<br /><br />Chapter 2 starts with \\"Radical political economy (RPE) consists of a particular methodology, theoretical analysis of capitalism, and vision for the future.\\"  (p. 24).  Figure 2.1 shows a Holistic View of Society, four intersecting circles, about 300 million fewer than the richly Subversive Morbidity.  The big dig at capitalist oppression shows up in Chapter 3.  \\"Once they go to work and go through the factory or office doors, they enter the world of work, . . .  In fact, under capitalism the world of work is regulated by command not voluntary exchange.  Many U.S. Constitutional rights held by citizens in the larger society, such as free speech and assembly, are not recognized within the factory or office where the rights of private property are sovereign.\\"  (p. 61).  \\"The social organization of the labor process in RPE is determined to a significant extent by capitalist strategies to control workers in order to extract as much work from them as they can.\\"  (p. 65).<br /><br />Chapter 4 goes further in the global dimension.  \\"Capitalist domination over workers would be incomplete if capitalists did not also dominate culture and use existing cultural creations to their advantage.\\"  (p. 79).  \\"Capitalist domination of the media, together with education, ensures that the dominant ideology propagated in society will legitimate capitalist domination of production and the labor process.\\"  (p. 84).  Things that government can do find an evaluation in Table 4.1, Government Policies and the Rate of Profit (p. 95).<br /><br />Chapter 5 examines income inequality and the usual daily economic news item, \\"Capitalism and Cyclical Economic Crisis.\\"  (pp. 111-116).  Everyone hopes we can expect \\"Long-Run Dynamics\\" (pp. 117-128).  The liquidity pump which provides the money and credit needed for the Subversive Morbidity to drive demand and keep such a process going is considered in a concluding subhead on \\"Fragile Financial Structure.\\"  (pp. 127-128).  Here we find, \\"Capitalist financial structures are fragile and have a tendency to overextend credit during periods of long-range expansion, threatening financial collapse and economic crisis, and offer too little credit during periods of stagnation stifling economic expansion.\\"  (pp. 127-128).  Radicals tend to notice how shaky the present situation is, but rarely extend the analysis to a future society in which a lot of The Subversive Morbidity lapse into pure subsistence, generating no demand and making further \\"long-run capital accumulation\\" (p. 128) highly unlikely, if not totally a thing of the past, such as it was.<br /><br />Chapter 6, Radical Alternatives to Capitalism, offers a discussion of capitalist reforms which, \\"Although these reforms fall far short of democratic socialism, such reforms are seen as transformative, moving the United States along a path that might eventually lead to a democratic socialist society.\\"  (p. 133).  RPE offers a bright vision of hope:<br /><br />\\"In order to ensure social priorities, radicals propose that many critical industries such as steel or banking and natural monopolies such as utilities be nationalized.  Public enterprises would be subject to the same rules of democratic decision making as worker-managed enterprises and subject to the same efficiency criteria as market-based enterprises.  Government-owned enterprises give government control over the commanding heights of the socialist economy, further enabling it . . .\\"  (p. 151).<br /><br />Except that in our society, I would expect such a proposal to be adopted only when The Subversive Morbidity could use it as a device to turn in 292 billion dollars of declining value in General Motors bonds for government bonds that might not decline in value as fast.  Maybe that level of financial catastrophe was not approaching as rapidly in the years when this material was first taught to college students, but RPE seems like mild social science compared to the financial situations those students are likely to face in their lifetimes.a discussion of capitalist reforms which, \\"Although these reforms fall far short of democratic socialism, such reforms are seen as transformative, moving the United States along a path that might eventually lead to a democratic socialist society.\\"  (p. 133).

Twenty-seven books of the Bible and the Ten Commandments are listed in the index, along with the poems of major poets compared to Dylan's work.  The Sins, Virtues, and Heavenly Graces used to list the Contents of the book are classical concepts that are not explicit subjects like adultery, death, friendship, war, and race, hardships which are so popular in modern psychological studies.  On Charity, most people don't get interested until the topic is Love, and that concluding chapter starts with a song called `Watered-Down Love' from the album `Shot of Love' which was \\"unlovingly shot down by the reviewers.\\"  (p. 468).  I know what song he means, but I'm not sure I can figure out what happened when it was recorded:<br /><br />`The studio out-take (which is the performance that was released but with a final verse that was edited out when released) ends its assurances not with the rising delight felt in the confidence that love that's pure \\"Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning\\", but with a further verse that would have demeaned the song into the self-serving, the self-pitying, and the self-praising:<br /><br />Love that's pure is not what you teach me<br /><br />I've got to go where it can reach me<br /><br />I've got to flee toward patience and meekness<br /><br />You miscalculate me, mistake my kindness for weakness<br /><br />`I don't mean that we would have had to take this as autobiographical; not that it would . . .  Whereas the song as released, and as blessedly released from its final verse, does not have even once any of the words \\"I\\", \\"me\\", or \\"my\\" . . .' (p. 469).<br /><br />\\"The studio out-take\\" is four lines longer than the song we already knew.  The personal is assumed to be stupid for hundreds of fans who might be unfamiliar with the psychological standards which allow Ricks as critic to proclaim, \\"For the move out from the large love that is charity to a love-affair about which one of the parties now feels uncharitable, this move is in itself a false move artistically.\\"  (p. 469).  Such theological judgments are likely to be unfamiliar to those people who are most familiar with Dylan's songs, limiting the appeal of this book to a narrow segment of the educated reading public.  Intellectual fanatics with a philosophical interest in religious issues might marvel at how well a modern professor can combine promoting religious interests in a pop culture without offending any readers except those who expected a book about Bob Dylan to be easy to understand.<br /><br />The Index of Dylan's Songs and Writings for this book is on pages 508-511, but it only lists a few pages for most songs.  Which Album a Song is on (pp. 512-517) is inclined to list just the first time a song appeared.  The exception which proves the rule is \\"Positively 4th Street:  Greatest Hits [1], Biograph, and The Essential Bob Dylan.\\"  That list does not include \\"Man of Peace,\\" a song mentioned on pages 158 and 449, (where the first line is quoted without mentioning the song) according to the Index of Songs, but which is also quoted much earlier, \\"You know Satan sometimes comes as a man of peace.\\"  (p. 43).  It is from the album Infidels, but according to the words I have, the final line of each verse starts with:<br /><br />You know, sometimes Satan . . .<br /><br />You know that sometimes Satan . . .<br /><br />I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.<br /><br />People who have learned the song well enough to sing it without having to look for the words of any of the eight verses might wonder how tired an author would have to be to write the words down in the wrong order when writing about songs by someone who is as popular as Bob Dylan, but this kind of thing is an occupational hazard for professors who write books and philosophers who wonder if the error was beneficial in any way.  Knowing Satan might be an approach that could draw on a lot more of our culture than just Dylan's songs, and the great song \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" by the Rolling Stones could be a wonderful start for that project.<br /><br />Christopher Ricks is extremely knowledgeable about critics, and those readers who are looking for new literary angles ought to gain a lot from his insight into the Dylan interviews that are also discussed in this work.  In a song with an `I -- You' framework, any mention of `he' is likely to apply more to the critic than to the singer or an audience, particularly in the lines:<br /><br />With the one who tries to hide<br /><br />What he don't know to begin with  (p. 66).<br /><br />This makes more sense in the song it's in, and in the section about envy:<br /><br />I know the reason<br /><br />That you talk behind my back<br /><br />I used to be among the crowd<br /><br />You're in with<br /><br />Do you take me for such a fool<br /><br />To think I'd make contact<br /><br />With the one who tries to hide<br /><br />What he don't know to begin with  (p. 66).<br /><br />This is `Positively 4th Street.'  The most positive thing this book has to say is about rhymes.  In another song,  \\"And the rhyme in this refrain is beautifully metaphorical, because it's a rhyme of the word `end' with the word `again':<br /><br />Oh, Mama, can this really be the end<br /><br />To be stuck inside of Mobile<br /><br />With the Memphis Blues again? (p. 31)<br /><br />\\"`End' and `again' are metaphorically a rhyme because every rhyme is both an endness and an againness.\\"  (p. 32).azard for professors who write books and philosophers who wonder if the error was beneficial in any way.

US	41560427	R2A1CPKMAJNANF	0631175350	842377039	A Kant Dictionary	Books	5	4	12	N	N	A learning tool, or intellectual underwear ?	In the area of pure intellectual thought, Kant occupies a unique place near the beginning of modern philosophy that shows to an amazing extent how much we have discarded his immediate predecessors, Leibniz (1646-1716, mentioned in 35 topics in this book) and Christian Wolff (1679-1754, mentioned in 44 topics).  For comparison, consider my favorite expert on Kant, Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860, who is mentioned only in nine topics, some of them quite small words, like: \\"drive, duty, force, will\\" per page 443) who studied Kant intensely and produced an \\"Appendix:  Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy\\" on pages 413-534 of THE WORLD AS WILL AND REPRESENTATION, Translated from the German by E. F. J. Payne in Two Volumes, Volume I.<br /><br />Those who have no need to learn Kant for the college credit to be gained by passing courses in philosophy might still consider how useful A KANT DICTIONARY by Howard Caygill will be for them as intellectual underwear.  Our modern world looks askance at anything that claims to be more absolute than underwear, but still allows revolutionary claims to be made for Kant by philosophers.  The scope of thought included in A KANT DICTIONARY might be cited as support for the idea that Kant was great.  However, he mainly placed himself on the political sidelines, far from ruthless political currents of the modern world, and staying close to home, much as Kris Kristofferson parodied the 20th century mainstream political mentality in his version of \\"Okie from Muskogee\\" with its humor about those patriotic heroes who don't shoot deadly marijuana, \\"and all we ever drop's our B.V.D.s.\\"  The comedy version of what goes around, comes around might seem more out of place applied to Kant than to anyone else, but this says as much about Kant as about our prime comedians, few of whom have the time to attempt to be as serious as those who teach Kant seem to be whenever they write a book.<br /><br />As a serious work, A KANT DICTIONARY does offer information  about the Copernican revolution in philosophy.  This book is clearer than Kant on the importance of key words in this explanation, `revolution,' `Revolutions,' `revolved around the spectator,' \\" `tried whether he might not have better success if he made the spectator to revolve and the stars to remain at rest'.  Yet while Copernicus's revolution\\" (p. 135) was found to conform to scientific laws, \\"Kant maintains that his CPR will go further than Copernicus by proving . . . that objects conform to knowledge, not knowledge to objects.\\"  (p. 136).  This is a nice bit of knowledge to have, also available in the Preface to Second Edition of Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON, pages B vii to B xliv as the pages of the standard edition are designated, running from Kant's discussion of the intuition of the spectator in metaphysics on page B xvi through a footnote on page B xxii, which made the claim, \\"The change in point of view, analogous to this hypothesis, which is expounded in the CRITIQUE, I put forward in this preface as an hypothesis only, in order to draw attention to the character of these first attempts at such a change, which are always hypothetical.  But in the CRITIQUE itself it will be proved . . .\\"<br /><br />The \\"List of abbreviations of Kant's published writings\\" on pages 5-6 is a key to understanding why letters like CPR and CPrR keep showing up, as well as \\"and the `Analytic of the Sublime' in CJ.\\"  (p. 348).  What sustains interest in this book is the idea that these are all great works, as basic for philosophy as the medical kind of CPR is the immediate response necessary to revive patients who need to be brought back to life when vital signs cease.  In the main section of A KANT DICTIONARY, the entry for death merely says \\"see Fear, Finitude, Immortality, Punishment, Time,\\" (p. 151) but there is also an interesting comment in the account of Kant's life, \\"after the death of Frederick the Great in 1786.  Frederick's successor, Frederick William II, initiated a counter-Enlightenment which sought, by means of censorship, to curb the freedom of the press and to extend obedience to precisely those arguments concerning Church and State permitted by his predecessor.\\"  (p. 10).  Kant was not in trouble until he published RELIGION WITHIN THE LIMITS OF REASON ALONE in 1793.  There was a time when Kant promised not to publish what he thought, but he was sensitive to who was likely to read his work.  \\"Kant considered himself released from his promise with the death of Frederick William II in 1797\\" (p. 11).  A KANT DICTIONARY is not afraid to devote a page to \\"church [Kirche] see also God, State, Theodicy, Theology.\\"  (p. 110).  But \\"Kant's ecclesiology has had relatively little impact upon modern theology.\\"  (p. 111).

But it might be wiser to suggest that almost everyone is already wise enough to see how THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA is the book in which Nietzsche fought for philosophy's right to party until it pukes.  Irony in philosophy ought to be compared to the mathematical technique of refuting some hypothesis by showing that an analysis of its logic leads directly to a contradiction of itself or some cherished principle.  In THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA, Nietzsche shows that mastery of philosophy includes a strong sense of when life has reached the desire to toss its cookies.  Socrates set the most striking standard in philosophy for when hemlock might be the drink best suited for making an example of one's belief.  Deadly party techniques have not disappeared in the 2400 years that have passed since the ancient Greeks let jurors decide the fate of individuals who had their own ideas about religion.  Nietzsche has a series of sections in the first part of THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA \\"on the Preachers of Death\\" and \\"On War and Warriors\\" (THE PORTABLE NIETZSCHE, pp. 156-160), but embraces the paradox of free death wholeheartedly in \\"On Free Death\\" (TPN, pp. 183-186) while suggesting that it was not quite right with Jesus:  \\"and for many it has become a calamity that he died too early. . . .  Would that he had remained in the wilderness and far from the good and the just!  Perhaps he would have learned to live and love the earth--and laughter too.  Believe me, my brothers!  He died too early; he himself would have recanted his teaching, had he reached my age.\\"  (TPN, p. 185).  As far as age goes, Nietzsche considers Jesus, who was once like a twelve-year-old in the temple, was not yet mature enough to be the sacrifice we need.  \\"But in the man there is more of the child than in the youth, and less melancholy:  he knows better how to die and to live.  Free to die and free in death, able to say a holy No when the time for Yes has passed:  thus he knows how to die and how to live.\\"  (TPN, p. 185).<br /><br />THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA challenges the notion that things happen in their proper time, and reading this book is hardly the most appropriate way to understand any particular moment, but the combination of ideas might help us understand how violent changes can occur when the mass of people feel \\"Would that a storm came to shake all this worm-eaten rot from the tree.\\"  (TPN, p. 185).  Pious platitudes are the cookies that get thoroughly masticated and swallowed with \\"sour apples, to be sure, whose lot requires that they wait till the last day of autumn:  and they become ripe, yellow, and wrinkled all at once\\" (TPN, p. 184), beer and potato chips, or whatever yellow party food Nietzsche got down before he found the logical conclusion:<br /><br />\\"Verily, Zarathustra had a goal; he threw his ball:  now you, my friends, are the heirs of my goal; to you I throw my golden ball.  More than anything, I like to see you, my friends, throwing the golden ball.  And so I still linger a little on the earth:  forgive me for that.\\"  (TPN, p. 186).is more of the child than in the youth, and less melancholy:  he knows better how to die and to live.

Highly modern societies have identified forms of oppression which make it easy for young people to turn against traditional values by identifying with entertainment personalities who can make opposition to mundane social norms entertaining by holding the creeps who end up on top up to ridicule.  Of the fifteen chapters in MIKHAIL BAKHTIN by Katerina Clark and Michael Holquist (Harvard University Press, 1984), the emphasis on comic themes increases as the book approaches Chapter 14, Rabelais and His World (pp. 295-320).  Halfway there, Chapter 7, Freudianism, set in the 1920s, includes the idea that Freud could attack dominant philosophies because his science had \\"an ambition to locate a world beyond the social and the historical, a search for this world precisely in the depths of the organic--these are the features that pervade all systems of contemporary philosophy and constitute the symptom of the disintegration and decline of the bourgeois world.\\"  (p. 176).  The revolutionary soviet society of Mikhail Bakhtin's lifetime (1895-1975) included perverse efforts to direct intellectuals to exalt the lowest of the people, on the one hand, as the secret police also tried to stifle any enemies of the ultimate power of the ruling system of ideas, on the other hand, based on building an advanced industrial society that exalted superpower values over other global values.<br /><br />Reading Freud as an ideology that didn't seem like any scientific description of nature, Bakhtin was smart enough to think that balance was not revealed by \\"mutual hostility and incomprehension and the endeavor to deceive one another.\\"  (p. 178).  Bakhtin assumes the doctor who tries to treat anyone must stand in for a society that can't allow idiosyncratic individual views.  The language of Freud can be seen politically because \\"This opposition between official and unofficial politicizes categories that less global thinkers would have felt were far from politics of any kind.\\"  (p. 181).  Bakhtin's science of ideologies tried to apply different idea systems to each other, joining a clash of ideas that is likely to last, for, \\"As Bakhtin never tired of saying, the last word is never said.\\"  (p. 196).<br /><br />Chapter 10, Marxism and the Philosophy of Language, makes the messiness of history a large part of the meaning of any utterance.  Concern about understanding the past has been the basis of the sciences of language.<br /><br />`Linguistics was the child of philology, and as such, it had always taken \\"as its point of departure an utterance that was finished, monologic:  the ancient written monument, considering it the ultimate realism . . .  Despite the vast difference in cultural and historical characteristics, from the ancient Hindu priests to the modern European scholar of language, the philologist has always and everywhere been a decipherer of alien, `secret' scripts and words . . .  The first philologists and the first linguists were always and everywhere priests.  History knows no nations whose sacred writings were not to some degree in a language foreign and incomprehensible to the profane.  To decipher the mystery of sacred words was the task meant to be carried out by the priest-philologists.\\" '  (pp. 222-223).<br /><br />The modern emphasis on entertainment values is in line with the amount of attention devoted to novels, an individual author's attempt to provide pleasure to individual readers.  Chapter 11, Dostoevsky's Poetics, brings up melodramatic similarities.  \\"Even at the level of personal experience there were affinities between them.  Both were arrested for political crimes, and just as Bakhtin's sentence to certain death in Solovki was changed to exile in Kazakhstan, so was Dostoevsky's death by firing squad on Semyenovsky Square commuted to exile in Siberia.\\"  (p. 239).  Bakhtin enjoyed finding characters in Dostoevsky's novels who were \\"capable of not agreeing with him and even of rebelling against him.\\"  (p. 240).  \\"Characters in a novel are not like flies, immobilized in the objectlike amber that surrounds them.\\"  (p. 243).  \\"Extralocality describes a position which can be known only through the most complex triangulation of interpersonal relations.\\"  (p. 246).  This is great for big themes.  \\"For instance, death is more often than not forced on characters in Tolstoy.\\"  (p. 247).  Christ is discussed as a \\"theological trope.\\"  (p. 248).  Similar work in \\"the most radical overturning of authority\\" (p. 250) is leading to comparison with carnival activities. \\"This juxtaposition of the Gospels and menippean tradition was also made by another philologist, Erich Auerbach, who, like Bakhtin, did some of his finest work in exile.\\"  (p. 250).<br /><br />Chapter 13, The Theory of the Novel, includes some discussion of the chronotope, a concept derived from Kant on space and time \\"in the sense of the total integration of neurological and psychological forces into a characteristic pattern that shapes our perception of the world.\\"  (p. 279).  Anthropologists have pointed out `the importance of the middle or betwixt-and-between stage called \\"liminality\\" which in a rite of passage separates the initial state of identity from the identity achieved at the conclusion of the rite.  This cultic aspect of the chronotope is present in Christian hagiography as well, where metamorphosis is encountered as conversion experience.'  (p. 283).<br /><br />Rabelais is appreciated for \\"carnival, which is a social institution, and grotesque realism, which is a literary mode.\\"  (p. 299).  \\"Carnival and the grotesque both have the effect of plunging certainty into ambivalence and uncertainty, as a result of their emphasis on contradictions and the relativity of all classificatory systems.\\"  (p. 304).  The Stalinism which celebrated workers as superheroes runs into the same contradictions, or their opposites, which might be even more absurd.  Their \\"Folk bards were set to writing epic songs and ditties glorifying the new age, . . .\\"  (p. 310).

US	41560427	R17OAND9NAJTXJ	0374519374	631839841	The Land of Ulro	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Compare Ulro, a realm of spiritual pain, to Gombrowicz	There are particular paths in the field of intellectual history that are so famous, after years of study, anyone is likely to expect certain names to appear in a certain order.  For those familiar with the work of William Blake, Czeslaw Milosz's title THE LAND OF ULRO suggests an explanation of a particular vision in some obscure prophetic and poetic work.  A scholarly approach would include an index in which all the pages mentioning Ulro could be identified and checked sequentially or by particular topics to clarify how Ulro is understood in this book.  But actually, Czeslaw Milosz is a poet, winner of the 1980 Nobel Prize for Literature, who summed up the twentieth century in a book called ROAD-SIDE DOG (1998) by remembering a slow trip by two-horse wagon.  \\"And always we were barked at by a dog, assiduous in its duty.  That was the beginning of the century; this is its end.\\"  (NEW AND COLLECTED POEMS (1931-2001), p. 645).<br /><br />Rather than being an intellectual history, this is more like a memoir of intellectual roots that was written in Polish (ZIEMIA ULRO) in 1977, and a Preface in English by Czeslaw Milosz dated 1984 apologizes for \\"too many allusions to poets and critics unavailable in English translation.\\"  (p. vi).  The translator Louis Iribarne provides notes on pages 277-287 for many of the names in the text, and seems particularly knowledgeable about Witold Gombrowicz (1904-69) on pages 277-278 and characters from his novel FERDYDURKE Professor Pimko and Miss Youthful on page 279.  The poet Adam Mickiewicz (1798-1855) has a ballad \\"The Romantic\\" on pages 97-99, translated into English by W. H. Auden.  Considered \\"The first in Polish literature to bear the title of a *wieszcz*--a vatic bard endowed with the properties of a charismatic national leader\\" (p. 282) Mickiewicz is also explained with reference to his major works, including a play in which \\"its poet-hero Gustav [is] reborn as the rebel Konrad.\\"  (p. 283).  People who have already read FERDYDURKE as a comic romp on the Polish pride in Polish poets might approach THE LAND OF ULRO as a more serious contemplation of the same theme by someone who deserves the respect that comedy lacks.<br /><br />Gombrowicz and Czeslaw Milosz were both educated in law before achieving fame as authors who spent much of their lives in the West.  THE LAND OF ULRO attempts to explain how the study of literature is so much like a dog chasing its own tale that legal studies seem closer to reality.  The ultimate state of our culture is suggested by the reflection in this book on seeing a photograph of Albert Einstein on the wall of a restaurant.<br /><br />\\"I stared up at the face, recalling how moved, how humbly respectful I had been, when many years ago I had made his acquaintance at Princeton.  To me he was not only a scientist; he had stepped quite suddenly from the pages of ARS MAGNA and LES ARCANES.\\"  (p. 226).<br /><br />That observation is from the end of section 35 of this book.  Section 31 begins with the observation, \\"In 1924 a small book by Oscar Milosz was published in Paris under the Latin title ARS MAGNA.  It consisted of five chapters or, as he called them, `metaphysical poems,' the first of which was written in 1916.  LES ARCANES, written in 1926 and published in 1927, is both a sequel to and an expanded version of the first book.\\"  (p. 187).  \\"Both make fiercely difficult reading, exasperating . . .\\"  (p. 188).  Section 16 began with the identification of \\"my distant cousin, Oscar Wladyslaw Milosz, who wrote under the name of O. V. de L. Milosz.\\"  (p. 61).  Skipping over section 34, I noticed a mention of Milton that I had long expected to find during the book's many references to William Blake:<br /><br />\\"The rebellion of the angels, which begot the power of evil, was, in effect, a catastrophe affecting the whole of creation, even if it did not produce another, equally powerful extreme opposed to good.  The first catastrophe is closely related to the second, the sin of our parents.  In Dante's DIVINE COMEDY the earth's center is occupied by the fallen (literally, headlong from heaven) angel, Satan.  Milton's PARADISE LOST treats the rebellion of angels as a cosmic catastrophe.  William Blake, though poetically indebted to Milton, `corrects' him by exonerating Satan, because, said Blake, he rebelled against a false God, the autocratic Jehovah.  For Blake, as I have said, the catastrophe occurred with the breakup of the unity of the human-divine family.\\"  (pp. 214-215).<br /><br /> Section 26 begins with, \\"To speak of Swedenborg is to violate a Polish taboo that prohibits writers from taking a serious interest in religion.\\"  (p. 135).  For one thing, his books were in Latin.  \\"But a reading public of enlightened, philosophically minded ladies and salon wits, either ignorant of Latin or deficient in it, now had to be addressed in the new international language of French.\\"  (p. 141).  Near the end of section 26, summarizing his visionary style, \\"The tension between Swedenborg's pedestrian style, stripped of poetic fancy, and the substance of his message conceals a richness difficult to name, before which we stand as before Escher's geometric drawings exploiting the paradoxes of three-dimensional space.  Despite the cloying repetitiveness and manifold tautologies, Swedenborg makes profitable reading, even if one is in no way moved to become a Swedenborgian.\\"  (p. 147).  Section 28 reveals, \\"Blake was born in 1757--the year of the Last Judgment, according to Swedenborg--and the significance of his birth date was not lost on him.\\"  (p. 158).  Blake's THE BOOK OF THEL (1789) is like:<br /><br />He who has never tasted bitterness<br />Will never taste sweetness in heaven.  (p. 163).<br /><br />Blake's great poem \\"Milton\\" is quoted on pages 172-174, compared to a Swedenborgian maxim, and quoted again on pages 179-180, without specifically mentioning the poet Milton, except as Northrup Frye binds \\"when Blake and Milton elaborate theories of history\\" (FEARFUL SYMMETRY, p. 195) (Milosz, p. 182).COMEDY the earth's center is occupied by the fallen (literally, headlong from heaven) angel, Satan.

This book from 1995 fueled scores, if not hundreds, thousands, or millions, of jokes which showed how ludicrous and infantile our feelings are when the basic situation of \\"millions of women everywhere\\" (dedication, six pages before page 1 starts \\"a chain of events that would forever alter the course of my life\\") is subjected to the nightly descent into entertainment values in an effort to show the American alter ego who we are, really.  The book has no index, so people who did not want to miss important themes were bound to read every page or guess if the chapter called \\"Baring It All\\" was what they wanted.  People who doubt that anything in this book actually happened might try paying more attentions to the Romans who had seen a statue by Bernini and proclaimed:  Truth is only at Bernini's house.<br /><br />Books have been an individual art-form that generally say more than any patient could expect to cover in therapy sessions.  In a culture which places more emphasis on money than on enduring relationships, it is not surprising to find Gennifer Flowers admitting, \\"I intended to relax and have fun.  I had always been a free spirit who liked to have fun, but now I intended to really pursue it.\\"  (p. 57).  So she was hired as a membership director at the Cipango Club in Dallas, and when \\"Finally someone yelled, `Gennifer, it's time for you to get up on that bar and dance.'  I didn't hesitate for a second.  I climbed right up, high heels and all, and danced through two complete songs.  Everyone was applauding and egging me on, and I was in heaven.\\"  (p. 58).  Moving from there to Branson, where \\"I would look out over the audience and see acres of white hair\\" (p. 59) and Roger Miller had to apologize for saying a word that happened to be in a joke he was telling.  \\"You'd have thought he slapped their mothers!\\"  (p. 60).  Then \\"I needed Bill to work his magic and recharge me again--I needed a `Bill fix.' \\"  (p. 60).<br /><br />Entertainment has become so much like an addiction that it is no wonder politics seems more closely related to the behavior of stars and fans than to maintaining a decent foundation for mutual trust in the future.  Entertainers need to make a lot of money when they are young because trends go out of style, and privacy has never been big when a society becomes as dominated by its communications media as the modern global world.  \\"The security guard would walk around the building and see Bill coming in through the side door, and the guard had a real loose tongue.\\"  (p. 63).  Soon she was concerned with \\"the reports and rumors that had begun to surface about what happened to those who tried to cross or become a threat to that all-powerful Arkansas power structure that stood behind Bill Clinton.\\"  (p. 84).  After Bill announced that he was running for president, \\"the possibility that my actions might have dangerous consequences for my mother scared me to death.\\"  (p. 93).  An attorney named Gary Johnson placed a video camera \\"so that it had a view directly out his front door and down the hall.  Because our doors were close together, he also got a very clear view of my apartment door.  When rumors began circulating that Bill and I were having an affair, Gary let it be known that he actually had a videotape of Bill coming to my apartment.  Big mistake.  Not long after that, some large men forced their way into his place, beat him senseless and left him for dead.  According to Gary, they kept asking where `the tape' was.  Sure enough, the videotape with Bill on it disappeared.<br /><br />\\"Gary, it seems, was a double threat because he was also acting as counsel for Larry Nichols, the man who filed the lawsuit against Bill Clinton.\\"  (pp. 93-94).<br /><br />Later, \\"my whole apartment had been ransacked\\"  (p. 96).  \\"Thank goodness I had put the tapes of our conversations in what I thought was a safe place, away from my apartment, a few days earlier.\\"  (p. 97).  Soon she had the opportunity to read about her troubles in the Star supermarket tabloid.  \\"Next to that was a picture of the apartment manager, who said in a caption that he had seen Bill visit me there ten to twenty times.\\"  (p. 103).  On a personal level, \\"What about all those people who had been hurt or killed when they became a threat to Bill Clinton and his circle of power?\\"  (p. 105).  So she spent two weeks talking to the Star reporter Marion Collins in New York \\"to make sure I had the chronology of events correct.  She was insistent I not slip up on dates and give anyone the opportunity to discredit my story on the basis of a factual error.\\"  (p. 108).  Also on a personal level, \\"I had spilled my guts so thoroughly to her that she almost seemed like my personal psychiatrist.\\"  (p. 109).<br /><br />The shrink business is not what it used to be, what with so many mental people being thrown into prisons where the authorities refuse to give them their medications, and the most effective personal drug preferences are likely to be illegal or considered contraband.  Dodging other reporters even became an adventure, as \\"Meanwhile, I was thrust into a cloak-and-dagger existence in New York.\\"  (p. 110).  Watching Bill and Hillary on Sixty Minutes following the 1992 Super Bowl \\"was sensational and they had a built-in audience. . . . It was all hype, and Bill took advantage of every opportunity to make himself look good.\\"  (p. 111).  Gennifer still thought it was possible that \\"Bill would have been a hero!  He would have created the appearance of a politician who could tell the truth, even if it was painful.\\"  (p. 111).few days earlier.\\"  (p. 97).

It is unlikely ever to be more famous than Lenny Bruce, who had the honor of Dustin Hoffman playing him in the movie \\"Lenny,\\" but it also devotes much of its attention to the difference between Jewish and goyish.  Chapter 5, \\"Jewish Jokes and the Acceptance of Absurdity,\\" ends on page 68 with a joke which starts:<br /><br />\\"Once a perverse Jewish young man in a small village in Poland enjoyed his role as apikoros [see appendix].<br /><br />The joke ends with:<br /><br />\\"I see,\\" said the older man.  \\"Let me tell you:  I'm an apikoros; you're a goy.\\"<br /><br />The last five years have not been kind to public intellectuals who share the annoying attitude of the people observing modern life who \\"have the stance of an outsider, and the soul of a critical student.  A tendency to laugh at absurdity and to traffic in jokes exploiting this tendency are constituents in American laughter generally, I think, and may well have their own sources there, but surely they have been abetted by the infiltration of Jewish humor.\\"<br /><br />Philosophically, I find that modern life generally ignores the ability of philosophers to refute common assumptions, but people have their own form of upmanship which consists of flipping out epistemic modalities like September 11, presidential leadership, or the triumph of free economies to justify their lack of awareness of any long-term consequences of grandiose missions and dubious crusades:  to the moon, to Mars (the god of war beacons), to Baghdad, to the Chinese embassy (was May 7-8, 1999 in Belgrade too recent to get a joke in this book?).  As the system works, people who know a lot of jokes are sure to guess the profession of the guys walking past a woman who say:<br /><br />\\"Man, Id like to screw her,\\" said one of the *******.<br />His companion answered, \\"Yeah?  Out of what?\\"<br /><br />Given the nature of professional ethics, the second of the two men might be considered more professional, more interested in the economic possibilities for financial rewards, than the first, while the first is merely reflecting years of absorbing modern entertainment values or male chauvinist pigishness (take your choice).  Since impeachment proceedings in 1999 were dominating the jokes which the public were hearing at the time, this book was riding on a crest of awareness that some professions need complicated rules about what you can say after you swear to tell the truth.  The president would have surprised everyone back in 1992 on \\"Sixty Minutes\\" after the Super Bowl if he had said,  \\"If I had to choose between telling the truth or lying my ass off, I'd pick Gennifer Flowers.\\"  That is easier to understand than all the is meanings in the world of doubletalk that professional mindbending encourages when faced with specific questions about allegations of infidelity.<br /><br />The 24 hour day puts strains on everyone's relations with each other, best illustrated by the line in \\"Get Off My Cloud\\" by the Rolling Stones in which an anonymous voice on the phone complains:<br /><br />\\"It's 3 a.m., there's too much noise.

The first hundred pages are on comedy, with a theory of operative fields for understanding the different levels that spectators use to keep track of plot twists in a multidimensional flow of ideas.  The serious part of the book is on artistic development of dramatic tensions, but I am not sticking to the unique terms used in INSIGHT AND OUTLOOK.  The last time I picked this book up was to compare it with something recent by Authur Miller on politics and acting, a much smaller book based on an article Miller wrote for `Harpers' that only had 19 lines per page, but which provided the information that recently the category *music and films* ranked fourth in US exports, after airplanes, which was third.  Koestler managed to get 35 lines per page on the copy of INSIGHT AND OUTLOOK that I was looking at.  The books were similar in outlook, considering the role that anyone who would attempt to lead thinking in any area of modern life would be stuck in a particular role that people could readily understand if performance was to be meaningful for the media that form the conduit between what goes on and whoever might be interested in knowing.  Koestler had written DARKNESS AT NOON before this book, and seems to be fascinated with thinking about how he did it.  Books used to be so serious.  The more you get the hang of this one, the more entertainment values will seem to be the ultimate criteria used by modern society to evaluate everything.  It is difficult to believe that a publisher could make any money on a book this big in the current market which forms such a defining part of our comic society.	2003-12-10
US	41560427	R6X9O38A850QI	0521446678	596362906	The Cambridge Companion to Early Greek Philosophy (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)	Books	3	0	1	N	N	A bit bland	This mix of the views of modern professors on the first steps into a field which started growing wild explanations when writing was not common, covering some authors who are known mainly for what Aristotle and Plato thought of them, though Diogenes Laertius was the source of 65 passages also considered, now available in English with little need for study of the original language in which a love of wisdom seemed to be a high ideal proper for those who would like to teach, attempts to locate the major ideas which started growing in this field up to and beyond the time of Socrates without trying to define the meaning of philosophy for that particular individual.  The scholarly division of labor makes it easy to suppose that knowledge in this field is sufficiently broad and diffuse enough to allow any student who specializes to become more of an expert than his teachers on some particular questions.  The Index of Passages on pages 399-413 includes a range of authors, in addition to the listings for Plato and Aristotle which were so numerous I didn't count them.  Undoubtedly this information will be helpful to students who are primarily concerned with learning what the professors of philosophy generally think about the Greek aspect of the roots of this tradition.  Those who are more interested in lively questions about the nature of Socrates as an individual devoted to a more public practice of philosophy might be disappointed in the slight treatment he receives, compared to the more scholarly Greeks considered in this book.<br />The summary section, Lives and Writings of the Early Greek Philosophers on pages xvii-xxviii includes twenty major names, but not Aristotle, Plato, or Socrates.  The twenty have life timelines on the Chronology on page xxix, but ten others, not all of whom were as late as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, are shown on page xxx.  The reason for the split between those now considered truly great and the topics considered in this book was made explicit in the first chapter:<br />\\"Given the sources at our disposal and Socrates' remarkable afterlife, it would be irresponsible to treat him simply as one among other thinkers of the fifth century B.C.  He must be viewed in association with Plato, and hence he is scarcely discussed in this book (but see Chapters 14-15).\\"  (p. 6).<br />Just to acknowledge that some major figures are included in this book, the chapter titles mention the Pythagorean tradition, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Zeno, Empedocles, and the atomists.  Professors from a number of countries have contributed to this book, but each seemed to be preoccupied with searching for explanations that might seem valid.  Evidence that we have now learned a bit more about chaos than Aristotle could admit in his time is provided in the observation, \\"Aristotle (Phys. II.8) criticizes Empedocles for assigning too great a role to chance in the production of natural kinds, but in this Empedocles is closer to modern science than is Aristotle.\\"  (p. 161).<br />There is not much emphasis in this book on individual character of a kind that make Heraclitus, Socrates, Nietzsche, and Freud such monumental thinkers among Germans who wanted to attempt something great in poetry or philosophy.  Perhaps the most psychological point is a note on Empedocles' claim that he has been treated like a god as \\"the claim so bizarre that he feels driven to assume that Empedocles is ironically criticizing those who adulate him excessively.\\"  (p. 361, n. 30, citing `Hermes' III (1983) pp. 170-79, with a title that appears to be in German.)  Since thousands of years have passed, \\"To what extent Empedocles' claim that he is honoured as a god is realistic, to what extent wishful thinking, we may never know (though the former is likely to have been larger than some modern readers might expect); in any case, there is a lack of embarrassment in his acknowledgment of his divinity which no parallel hitherto cited from epic or mystery cults makes less remarkable.  Not only does Empedocles tell us he is a god but he also explains elsewhere why he has been temporarily exiled from the gods so that he might come to speak to us . . .\\"  (p. 355).  A fragment designated DK 31 B112 in the Diels/Kranz numbering system used in the book, which was the beginning of the poem \\"Purifications\\" by Empedocles, clearly claims, \\"They follow me in their thousands, asking where lies the road to profit, some desiring prophecies, while others ask to hear the word of healing for every kind of illness, long transfixed by harsh pains.\\"  (p. 355).<br />As inspiring as some of the things in this book are, much seems odd.  Those who believed in atoms were quick to argue, \\"for instance that the number of atomic shapes must be infinite, because there is no more reason for an atom to have one shape than another (Simplicius, In phys. 28.9-10).\\"  (p. 183).  Soon enough, philosophy produced \\"the distinction that Sextus immediately attributes to Democritus between `bastard' knowledge provided by the senses and the `genuine' knowledge provided by the intellect (B11).\\"  (pp. 191-192).  \\"As a result, if the senses are altogether unreliable, there are no reliable data on which to base the theory, so, as the senses say to the mind in B125, `Our overthrow is a fall for you.'\\"  (p. 192).  The attempt by Aristotle to sort out claims by Democritus \\"that either nothing is true, or it is unclear to us\\" (p. 194) is called \\"a very puzzling passage, for a number of reasons.\\"  (p. 194).

Map 2 on page 24 shows locations where objects in an exhibit that was shown in New York at the Asian Society Museum in 2001 and in Palm Beach, Florida in 2002 were originally found.  There was not much jade in the collection, but the reclining ram shown on page 75, about six inches long, has some interesting color variations.  A jade hairpin, less than an inch wide and about three inches long, is shown on page 115.  A smaller jade hairpin is shown on page 262.<br />This book documents many unique features of this area of China, including a picture of the face of a massive seventy-five foot Tang Buddha in Dunhuang's Cave 130 (photo on p. 35 by Annette L. Juliano).<br />The most interesting natural feature in the book is Maijishan Mountain, near the city of Tianshui at the southeastern end of Gansu, shown in a picture on page 118 and described as Cornrick Mountain on page 119, with a line drawing showing the features on the outer face of the lower part of the mountain on page 135.  The photo on page 134 shows the bottom side of steps, platforms, and railings built into the smooth wall of the mountain, with no supports coming down to the ground below.  In fact, the picture on page 118 shows the ground so far below the connected platforms that a zoom lens must have been used for the picture on page 134 even if the picture was taken from the top of a tree.  The description in the book is apt:<br />&quot;Fig. 14.  Maijishan is a stunning haystack-shaped mountain that rises 142 meters and is honey-combed with caves filled with sculptures, stelae, and paintings, of which 194 survive.  (photo:  Annette L. Juliano).&quot;<br />There are at least two sculptures in this book of Buddhist disciple Kasyapa, a sandstone statue with a large round head, shown on page 200, and one from Cave 87, Maijishan stone grottoes (object number 62), an old man with drooping eyebrows and deep creases in his forehead, shown on pages 14, 137 and 180, &quot;marked here as a foreigner by the beaklike nose.&quot;  (p. 137).  The bronze figure in a dervish dress on the back cover, shown and discussed on pages 254-255, also has a nose that a parrot might identify with.<br />The bronze horses shown on pages 38 and 39 are both showing their teeth and looking sprightly.  The clay figures shown on pages 65, 88-93, 102, and 106-110, look a bit lumpy and don't show much spirit, but the conglomeration is a great preparation for the clay hens and chicken coop found in a tomb in the western suburbs of Guyuan, Ningxia, of a man and wife who died in 569 and 547, shown on page 111.  The same tomb had a glass bowl that had been made in a mold in Sasanian Persia, shown on page 97, found with a silver ewer that is discussed on pages 98-100.<br />Chapters 6 and 7, The Merchant Empire of the Sogdians, and The Sogdians in Their Homeland, covers an area east of the Aral Sea including Samarkand and Tashkent, far west of China.

The book praises those that it can describe as liberal in their attitudes:<br />\\"An extreme example of fully conscious anti-stereotypy is 5046, an executive secretary in the movie industry, in her late thirties, actively engaged in the labor movement. . . . When given the check list, she laughed and said:  `Of course, one can't generalize . . . these are the stereotypes used by the anti-Semites to blame the Jews for certain faults . . . I don't think one should label any group like this . . . it is dangerous, especially in regard to the Jews,' \\" (p. 646).<br />Examples of the checklist items begin to appear on page 63, in Table I (III) Anti-Semitism Subscale \\"Offensive.\\"  Table 3 (III) Anti-Semitism Subscale \\"Attitudes\\" even has the suggestion, \\"II-24.  It would be to the best interests of all if the Jews would form their own nation and keep more to themselves.\\"  (p. 65).  Then there were wars in 1948, 1967, 1973, and an occupation in Lebanon in the 1980s or 1990s that begin to look like Israel and the United States were not seeing this situation in the same way as the rest of the world.  Opinions are not totally antagonistic to some form of sanity throughout the entire book.  Part IV, Qualitative Studies in Ideology, starting on page 601, includes Chapter XVI, Prejudice in the Interview Material, in which subjects of this study had the opportunity to express themselves in whatever manner best accentuates their own characters.  Though this book was published in 1950, it has some comments that seem perfectly capable of looking ahead to the kind of policy that America is pursuing today.<br />\\"Sending them to Palestine is silly because it is not big enough.  A good idea to have a country of their own, but big enough so that they can go ahead with their pursuits in a normal way, but the Jews would not be happy.  They are only happy to have others work for them.\\"  (p. 631).<br />The first suggestion on page 631 was called \\"mental perversion,\\" and the authors are quick to label \\"this subject's pseudorational statement on Palestine:  while apparently willing to `give Jews a chance,' he simultaneously excludes any prospect of success by referring to the Jews supposedly unchangeably bad nature:\\"  (p. 631).  This seems to be particularly cruel to Jewish anti-Semites, who treat being Jewish as a family imperative which individuals attempt to escape:<br />\\"I have a cousin who was in love with me and wanted to marry me.  He was more Jewish than I.  I loved him, but wouldn't marry him.  I told him why--because he's Jewish.  He is now married to a Gentile with two children.  He's more anti-Semitic than I.  That's true of so many Jews--like they were lame or hunchback.  They hate it or resent it.\\"  (p. 639).<br />I wouldn't have picked this book up if I didn't expect to find a lot of perverse mentality relating to authoritarianism.  As you might expect, the authors of this book had a fit or funk whenever they had to write about anyone who expressed sympathy for Hitler in this book for being able to discipline most of Europe in a manner that might be considered punitive by people who did not share his ideals.  Scoring of their psychological tests was most concerned with identifying people who were high in ethnocentricity and fascism.  The references on pages 977-982 has 121 numbered items, mostly used as they were intended, as:<br />\\"83.  Morgan, C.D., and Murray, H.A.:  A method for investigating fantasies:  the Thematic Apperception Test.  `Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry' 34:289-306, 1935.\\"  (p. 981).<br />Psychological testing does not have the same reputation in the 21st century that it was trying to project in 1950.  The Unabomber might be the most famous example of someone whose views were shaped by being involved in psychological experiments as an undergraduate at Harvard University, possibly for secret research being conducted for the CIA, though without LSD.  The book HARVARD AND THE UNABOMBER by Alston Chase has an attitude about some professor Murray and the undergraduate curriculum in disillusionment that is quite a contrast to the presentation contained in THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY.  Mainly due to television, I'm afraid that social scientists failed to achieve a humane society, and the greatest mental perversion maintains its hold on public opinion in spite of those who planned to work with humanities viewpoints to educate Americans out of their attitudes, like \\"57.  Most people don't realize how much our lives are controlled by plots hatched in secret by politicians.\\"  (p. 250).  Having access to actual information about how often the system has been abused has fostered an anti-political attitude that rigidly associates politics with bloodshed, particularly in and around Palestine, that may ultimately be more likely to bring out the worst nature in peoples than American missiles being able to put a thermonuclear weapon into the men's room at the Kremlin.<br />For people who are interested in what scales particular psychological questions are graded on, there are a number of examples given in this book, which are now considered merely prejudices of the bigoted:<br />\\"I-12.  The Jewish problem . . .\\" (p. 65).<br />\\"II-20.  Jewish millionaires . . .\\" (p. 66).<br />\\"5.  The Negroes . . .\\" (pp. 105, 110).<br />\\"8.

The map of Tibet and its border with northern India is shown inside the front cover, with a line marking Harrer's route from Dehra Dun near the Ganges River in India, up into the Himalayas far northwest of Mt. Everest.  After escaping from a prison camp in April, 1944, and climbing for 18 days to Tibet, then stuck in Traduen until December, 1944 while they waited for permission to travel further, they waited in Kyirong on the border of Nepal until November, 1945, when they escaped again.  \\"To avoid large cities, we decided to move even farther north, into the Changthang region--the famous Tibetan Plateau.  Here we would see only nomads and brigands; government officials avoided the area.\\"  (p. 43).  Walking into Lhasa like starving beggars on January 15, 1946, \\"We thought of our adventures and of our comrades still in the internment camp at Dehra Dun.\\"  (p. 47).<br />Heinrich Harrer is famous, now, as the author of the best-selling book, SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET, which told the same story.  LOST LHASA was not published until 1991, when the 2000 negatives which he had kept became the best reminder he had of the years he had enjoyed most.  There is a lot of writing in this book to tell the entire story again, and in places where there aren't many pictures, the people are still fascinating.  A young couple, who had given Peter Aufschnaiter and Harrer each a dried apricot on a 20,000-foot pass two months before, had much to complain about after they reached Lhasa.  \\"They were surprised that they had to work for daily necessities, even if it was only a place to spend the night or a cup of tea.  They felt that people in Lhasa were greedy, demanding things that in the Changthang you wouldn't think about. . . . We invited them to our modest home, where we had lots of barley, rice, and butter, and we supplied them for their return to the Changthang, their nomadic home, where they had plenty of meat, butter, cheese, milk, and where nature would provide for all their needs.\\"  (p. 65).<br />Picture captions are jumbled together.  The caption under the picture on page 116 explains \\"Noblemen and women . . .\\" with everyone in winter clothes \\"in front of the Kumbum monument in Gyangtse [above].  The girl [right] sits behind three fancy teacups, complete with stands and cover.\\" also explains the picture of a young child on page 117 with very short hair and a necklace of beads sitting behind a table with four teacups.  My first clue that it was a picture of a girl was the covers on the teacups.  The 7-inch-square picture on page 116 shows plain cups and saucers.  I did not realize that four teacups with stands and covers were on the table in front of the kid until I tried to measure the height of each cup to see if they were taller than the kid's head in the picture.  Allowing for perspective, it might be possible for a knob on top of the fourth teacup to be mistaken for an earring, just below one of the kid's ears, but the earring pictures are elsewhere in this book.<br />Several trips to Lhasa are described in this book, including \\"When I returned in 1982, I found that the Chinese had destroyed the medical school that perched atop Chagpori and replaced it with a radio tower.\\"  (p. 208).  A Glossary on pages 218-219 explains terms like Dob-Dob (monk-police) and Tsampa (parched barley flour, the Tibetan's staple food).  Notes on the pictures on page 220 identify two of the people in the picture on page 116 and explain that the picture following it is of the daughter of Surkhang Wangchuk, the governor of Gyangste.  Harrer had fled Lhasa and was staying with the governor of Gyangste when the Dalai Lama with a caravan that contained more than a thousand animals came through on the flight from Tibet to the Chumbi Valley.  Harrer left there in March, 1951.  \\"Meanwhile, the Dalai Lama returned to Lhasa to find posters of Mao plastered against the walls of the Potala.\\"(p. 207).  Among the brighter aspects of the nostalgia in this book is the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to the Dalai Lama in 1989 because he \\"opposed the use of violence.  He has instead advocated peaceful solutions based upon tolerance and mutual respect, in order to preserve the historical and cultural heritage of his people.\\"  (pp. 216-217).  This book is a monument to that tradition.(p. 207).

US	41560427	R1DGGCOOVIHVGE	0393312925	505602720	Peddling Prosperity: Economic Sense and Nonsense in an Age of Diminished Expectations (Norton Paperback)	Books	5	4	11	N	N	Very professional and witty	Published in 1994, PEDDLING PROSPERITY by Paul Krugman establishes the intellectually substantial foundation of the current political economy columnist for the New York Times.  Today he has a name as a leading critic of the tax cutting fiscal policies of a younger President Bush, but this book is proof of his ability to outwit nonsense in the political arena whenever he is sure that the mainstream university professors of economics will back him up.  Reading this book was like a roller coaster ride for me, bringing back that sense of uneasiness that I never escaped as long as Nixon was alive.  The best evidence that this book was finished before Nixon's death in 1994 is the footnote on page 260 about computing overall productivity according to `a recent study by Robert Lawrence of Harvard University and Matthew Slaughter of MIT:  &quot;Trade and U.S. Wages:  Great Sucking Sound or Small Hiccup&quot; (forthcoming).'<br />In this great roller coaster ride, Chapter 10 at the end of the book was the sudden dip in total darkness near the end, when a strobe flash and digital camera took a picture of each car in the instant of weightlessness that looks like shock in the prints available where riders exit from the roller coaster cars.  There was a warning in Chapter 9 that we were heading in this direction:  &quot;So there won't really be a race to see who gets the global jackpot.&quot;  (p. 242).  It just gets funnier than I remember it being at the time.  Sudden drops began happening even before this book was finished for the political movement of those `who came briefly to be known as &quot;Atari Democrats,&quot;  . . . (The label was dropped after Atari moved its production to Asia in 1983.)'  (pp. 249-250).<br />The American economy continues to grow, as is usually expected, and the big story in this book is how those who absorb an idea or two from economists promote political remedies when economic problems become too obvious.  I like the charts in the book, particularly Figures 1 (p. 25), 2 (p. 42), and 3 (p. 46), which are explained well in the text.  Figure 2 has data from 1961 to 1969 showing a clear line, the Phillips curve, with a tremendous increase in inflation for unemployment rates less than 4 percent.  Assuming that the 1960s reflected economic reality, &quot;This conclusion was actually written into law:  the much-ignored Humphrey-Hawkins bill of 1978 in fact requires the U.S. government to seek to achieve a 4 percent unemployment rate.&quot;  (p. 43).  A larger chart in Figure 3 shows how the events spiraled out of control, with unemployment over 8 percent in 1975 and inflation exceeding 12 percent in 1974, 1979, and 1980.  I think Robert Mundell called this moving the Phillips curve in his Nobel Prize Address in 1999 on international currencies in the twentieth century, but Krugman's label for &quot;Figure 3 . . . But that tradeoff fell apart, just as Milton Friedman had predicted.&quot; (p. 46) would seem to imply that the curve was fictitious all along.<br />Political economy seems to be more like generating enthusiasm for a particular thing.  University economists are so entangled in maintaining their overall big picture that people engaged in a single task are likely to become far too eccentric to suit the professors.

A GRAND GUY THE ART AND LIFE OF TERRY SOUTHERN does not have anything about Mark Twain or printing, but it reveals a lot about the entertainment business in the second half of the 20th century.  I was interested in how Terry Southern put in some time in World War Two as a young man.  He was so young, he didn't get into combat until the Battle of the Bulge, a winter offensive by the Germans after D-Day, June 6, 1944, when the guys in the 435 Quartermaster Platoon were so close to the action that a buddy standing beside Terry was killed.  (p. 18).  That might account for Terry's appreciation of William Burroughs, which might be a high point in the irony in this book:<br />\\"Then Chuck Barris, the mercurial producer of such TV shows as `The Dating Game,' took out an option on NAKED LUNCH and sent Southern and Burroughs first-class plane tickets to talk story at his Bel-Air mansion.  The two literary outlaws were picked up by a chaffeur-driven Daimler at the airport and taken to their audience with Barris.<br />\\"Barris was just all-out insanity,\\" says Burrough's longtime assistant, James Grauerholz.  \\"The story is that he said, `I finally read the book last night.  Can you take out the sex and drugs?'  Terry and Bill looked at each other and said, `We'll try,' \\"  (p. 201).<br />This is such a perfect reflection of the state of entertainment values; the people in this book kept betting their lives on being able to come up with something that will draw big at the box office.  On the same page, Jerry Schatzberg remembers how much fun he had writing a script with Terry Southern of `A Cool Million' by Nathanael West:  \\"He was brilliant with dialogue.  And we had a lot of fun.\\"  (p. 201)	2003-11-17
US	41560427	R5CL1KWA8PJ4J	1892941945	524817533	A Philosophy of War	Books	2	2	7	N	N	The prose is overwhelmed by the ideas	Much of this book depends on the economic views of Mises and Hayek, in which government expansion is often an enemy of pure economic activity, and cooperative exchange forms the basis for a free society.  In the Conclusion of A PHILOSOPHY OF WAR, the most basic form of this idea is attributed to philosophers, but then modern complications set in:<br />&quot;As trade increases, the desire for war should decrease.  This is an argument deployed by Hume, Kant, Cobden, and a series of pro-market economists in the 20th century, but the pacification of the market is not a necessary development.  Against free market optimists, we may recognize the benefits of cooperative activity over non-cooperation, of the international division of labor over the parochial, yet rationally such beliefs may be confused or countered by competing visions of the self and other, especially if the other is foreign:  rhetoric may fall back on the atavistic language of prejudice to produce highly complex theories rationalizing isolationism or aggression, some even using economic analysis to explain the ostensible economic rewards of war.&quot;  (p. 246).<br />I might have read half this book, but the further I went, the more I questioned how well I could keep reading it.  Chapter 11, Rationalism and War, has a section on &quot;The Failure of Realism:  the Vietnam War&quot;  (pp. 188-195), which was not a good place for me to start.  The first sentence, on &quot;all attempts by man to impose an ideal state of affairs or balance of power on the world,&quot; (p. 188) had a note quoting Mark Twain on his own progress from &quot;When I was a boy of fourteen, my father was so ignorant . . .&quot; (p. 202, n. 81) to illustrate how &quot;utopias are often the product of immature minds.&quot; (Ibid.).  The next note seemed incomplete:<br />&quot;82.  Bismarck, German Chancellor, certainly proved a capable&quot;  (p. 203).<br />If this book was meant to be published lecture notes, as some books undoubtedly are, a professor might prefer to finish such an aside with some grand strategy balance of power play that would have some appeal for students taking classes that year.  Perhaps the author meant to fill in more ideas as publication approached in the year 2002, but sent it to the press without a final read-through to see if readers would have any idea what he was trying to say.  On Nam, he imagines that the Americans were in cahoots with both sides.  &quot;In effect, America had bank-rolled the French defense, but America had also undermined Western efforts to control Vietnam by sponsoring a coup led by Ho to overthrow the pragmatic Vietnamese emperor.&quot;  (p. 194).  Usually, Americans give credit to Diem for winning an election against the emperor in 1954, like it was the South Vietnam primary and practice ballot box control exercise to prepare for the 1956 re-unification of Vietnam vote that never took place.  Then &quot;Eisenhower acquiesced in realist fears, side-stepped democratic obligations to set up elections, mumbled about defending freedom, and finally committed America to defending South Vietnam.&quot;  (p. 194).<br />A few generalities in this book are worth knowing.  Reasons can be important, because &quot;Man chooses war, and by this is meant that each individual participant chooses war (or has to choose differently, if war is thrust upon him through invasion or conscription).  The individual is a volitional being, whose cognition is free to use and direct; and in group activity such as a battle, each individual must contribute his thought and effort -- even if only accepting the orders of others.&quot;  (p. 39).  One of the big questions in any war is whether anyone knows what everybody else is going to do, and the intellectual overview misses the big picture as often as anyone else does.  As warfare becomes more modern, five-man teams, like those which hijacked American airliners on September 11, 2001, might be ideal, and the fact that only 19 hijackers have been identified, instead of 20, is a good sign that five percent of people who want to do this stuff will not end up on crashing planes, whatever their intentions were.  What can be done against such groups is considered in this book:<br />&quot;Tightly organized groups of soldiers, cooperating, whatever the nature of their tactics, more often than not overwhelm the loosely organized, . . . :  such becomes the menace of the guerrilla or the terrorist (the more advanced guerrilla, who employs civilian cover for his tactics and who deploys total or unrestrained war against civilians).<br />&quot;. . . Waging war against terrorist and guerrilla groups invalidates tactics that are useful in the classic pitched battles of the modern era, yet, as with all armies, such cells need supply bases and directing leaders to sustain them.  These become the targets for those having to wage war on an apparently amorphous enemy.&quot;  (p. 113).<br />People who live in the area of such attacks can be expecting soldiers to break down their door in the middle of the night, looking for weapons and explosives, for years to come.  Such small groups are capable (5,000 equals five times a thousand) of causing trouble, collective aggression, and &quot;wars are likely to be sustained or re-invoked, even when a culture has apparently settled upon a peaceful life.&quot;  (p. 114).  Most of the book is about ideas, beliefs, the influence of our animal nature, and culture.  The animal instinct is supposed to make everyone gather tightly together in a herd, all think alike, and repel any outsider.  There is not much in the index, pages 263-266, not even a Freud, though an attempt to quote &quot;Why War&quot; in note 49 on page 118 turned into a quote of the quotation itself:  &quot;Indeed it might well be called the ` . . . &quot;death instinct&quot;, ' &quot;.kers have been identified, instead of 20, is a good sign that five percent of people who want to do this stuff will not end up on crashing planes, whatever their intentions were.

There is no entry in the index for historicity, but the idea of historicity, which is so important in understanding arguments about right and wrong, could teach us more than the index, which has the names of lots of philosophers in unusual conceptual combinations: Hegel and truth, Hegel and Kuhn, Hegel and Bloom, Nietzsche and James, Kant and James, and names that only appear in the notes at the end of the essays in this book.  Published in 1982, the final note for Essay 3, &quot;Overcoming the Tradition:  Heidegger and Dewey&quot; contains an acknowledgement, thanking &quot;my late colleague Walter Kaufmann for helpful comment on a draft of this paper.&quot;  (p. 59, n. 73).  Essay 3 was originally read at a conference in 1974 and published in `The Review of Metaphysics' in 1976, a few years before Walter Kaufmann's death in September, 1980.  Overcoming tradition might be a small accomplishment, compared to living in a time so comic that laughter might be considered an important cause of the death of an arguer.  Having many philosophers and no Philosophy, as much of this book implies, might be as funny as the fatal truth that hardly anyone could believe any of this stuff before, during, or after its historicity.<br />I would prefer to review this book as if the particular philosophical questions which it collected in the essays (set in the subtitle in the timeframe 1972-1980) serve as a better example of the comedy which was popular in the field of topical humor about politics in a time of turbulent opinions during those years after the death of Lenny Bruce from an overdose of narcotics and before we could watch &quot;South Park&quot; and, unfortunately, of more interest to us today than what Truth or Philosophy might mean.  The Introduction, in particular, which attempted to tie the essays together in a manner which suggests that Rorty would prefer some intellectual position that defines the nature of his self, but admitting that a thorough reading might convince us that he had not yet achieved an understandable consistency, fades into insignificance when we readers confront such statements as &quot;Even if I were thinking, which I am not, that would not show that I exist.&quot;  (p. 7).  Ha?  Ha?  Ha?<br />Is a title like &quot;The World Well Lost&quot; (pp. 3-18) even decent?  Does humor form a barrier to understanding the title &quot;Keeping Philosophy Pure:  An Essay on Wittgenstein&quot;  (pp. 19-36) when a key theme of the essay is &quot;Yet Wittgenstein came in the end to mock his own creation,&quot; (p. 19) &quot;vapid imitation&quot; (p. 22), and that philosophers' attempts to understand Wittgenstein involve &quot;the same paradoxes elaborated by Wittgenstein himself (who cheerfully tosses out half-a-dozen incompatible metaphysical views in the course of the INVESTIGATIONS).&quot;  (p. 23) ?  Moving right along, Essay 4, &quot;Professionalized Philosophy and Transcendentalist Culture&quot; (pp. 60-71) begins with the suggestion that &quot;Santayana saw us as one more great empire in the long parade.  His genial hope was that we might enjoy the imperium while we held it.  In a famous essay on American philosophy, he suggested that we were still spoiling our own fun.&quot;  (p. 60).  Our society produces a fine mix of &quot;joy in business itself&quot;  (p. 60), &quot;We can afford to smile at this,&quot; (p. 61), &quot;the contempt the successful feel for the shabby genteel.&quot; (p. 61), &quot;pointing with scorn to the low level of argumentative rigor among the competition&quot; (p. 62), and ultimately:<br />&quot;American sociology, whose early stages had been satirized as the expenditure of a five-thousand-dollar grant to discover the address of a whorehouse, came to be satirized as the expenditure of a five-million-dollar grant to plot the addresses of a thousand whorehouses against a multidimensional array of socio-economic variables.&quot;  (pp. 63-64).<br />Now that home computers make this much information readily available to millions of curious web surfers for study at a level that could be used to see how the number of credit card transactions at the whorehouses compared with the rate of personal bankruptcy in the area around each whorehouse, we are closer than ever to &quot;the highbrow and the academic philosopher viewing each other with equal suspicion, each harping on the vices of each other's virtues.&quot;  (p. 65).

Then he was.  Then, after he died, he seemed to be more useful than Karl Marx to anyone who was interested in how modern economies actually operate in the best times, when statistics actually reflect the level of some real activities.  Two earlier biographies by Robert Skidelsky cover the years in which Keynes gained in stature and wrote his General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936), described by Joseph Schumpeter as \\"the dying voice of the bourgeois crying in the wilderness for the profits it dare not fight for.\\"  (FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM 1937-1946, p. 4).  This final volume starts with the problems with his heart that, after ten years of making Keynes an invalid, deprived the world of his advice at a time when situations continued to change at a pace which needed someone to keep applying different aspects of the General Theory in time to keep most elements of society from feeling that they were being swindled.  He never had enough power to make a miraculous demonstration of anything, but the spread of American wealth after World War Two made many professionals think that it was possible, if not already proved, that happy days could keep reappearing here again far more optimistically than Joseph Schumpeter's dour statement.<br />Economics has become a science which is widely taught at a college level.  Robert Skidelsky seems comfortable with writing about the political struggles involved, the nature of intellectual controversies in the field, and he is generous in his comments about Friedrich von Hayek, author of THE ROAD TO SERFDOM, and Milton Friedman, who emphasized other aspects of political economy.  The years 1937-1946 had major problems of their own, and there is far more attention in FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM paid to the people that Keynes had contact with and responsibilities to.  The Preface to the American Edition is dated 6 October, 2001.  Already the author was prepared to apply a lesson of this book to our life and times:<br />\\"To be reminded of the realities of alliance politics, even in the case of such close partners as Britain and the United States, is timely in the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September, when the United States is working to construct a global coalition against terrorism.  In 1940, it was British vulnerability which threw it into the arms of the United States.  America did not fail its fellow-democracy; but also used the occasion to settle old scores, and secure pole position in the post-war international order.\\"  (p. xv).<br />A major episode in this book recounts how an economic genius approaches the United States of America on behalf of a bankrupt country at the end of a big war to get debts pushed far enough into the future to be able to convince himself `If we don't make it by then, we're sunk anyway,' only to be asked why he didn't bring along the trade representatives.  Countries which did not get involved in the current endless war might have leaders who read the British edition, which was published in 2000.  Even at the beginning of this book, Keynes thought a government was foolish to commit itself to a war before the overwhelming mass of its people were convinced that the war was absolutely necessary, even after he felt that the Munich Agreement had been a pathetic trick.<br />This book describes Keynes as being conservative, and the picture it paints of his legacy continues the tradition of maintaining a bias in favor of economic stability.  The Truman-Eisenhower years had a durable mix.  \\"Setting tax rates to achieve an employment target consistent with a low rate of inflation was properly Keynesian; . . . It was to keep inflation under control by methods which did not bring about the collapse of the secular boom.\\"  (p. 505).<br />\\"However, U.S. fiscal restraint broke down in the 1960s.  In 1962, the second-generation Keynesian economists who came in to office with President Kennedy were convinced that the long-predicted slump was at hand.  A further stimulus to action was the quite unwarranted fear that the Soviet Union would win the Cold War economically and politically, without any need for a hot war.  So the scene was set for the big Kennedy-Johnson tax cuts and `Great Society' programmes.\\"  (p. 505).<br />Economists might be familiar with the description of what followed, but the attempt to maintain a coherent theory is admirable when we get to:  \\"Friedman's own attacks were launched from within Keynes's own macroeconomic citadel, but, by ruthlessly applying the maximizing logic to individual behavior, he gave two of the Keynesian `functions' -- the consumption function and the demand for money function -- properties of stability which they had lacked in their Keynesian form.\\"  (p. 506).<br />The picture of the doctor responsible for treating Keynes's heart, James Plesch, is labeled \\"the doctor who brought JMK `back to life', and whom he called `the Ogre'.\\"  (facing page 166).  This is a typically British nickname for a Jewish Hungarian who left Germany in 1933 and settled in England.  (p. 40).  The author and I suspect that he was more thorough than British doctors.  \\"There is no reason to doubt Keynes's own view that it was Prontosil which had brought about his dramatic improvement.  Unfortunately, it was subsequently discovered that Prontosil was effective against the green streptococci lodged in the throat but not against those already firmly established in the valves of his heart.\\"  (p. 43).  He lived through World War Two.  He was losing money in the stock market before the war, as some people must have realized that weird things were about to happen to the economy.  Keynes died before some of the big changes that were afoot.

Eventually, I even thought of a song, \\"Catfish\\" by Bob Dylan (Words by Bob Dylan and Jacques Levy) recorded on July 28, 1975, an outtake from the album \\"Desire\\" that was finally released in a three-CD package called \\"The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 [rare and unreleased] 1961-1991.\\"  There was once a pitcher called Catfish Hunter, million dollar man, and Dylan's chorus said, \\"Nobody can throw the ball Like Catfish can.\\"  I have had the words since \\"The Songs of Bob Dylan\\" was released in 1976, but I didn't hear the song until 1991.  Having an English translation from 2001 of a feminist biography of a political scientist of the mid-twentieth century captures the intellection activity that interests me about as well as \\"Catfish\\" captures the action of a baseball game.<br />Lazy stadium night, Catfish on the mound,<br />\\"Strike three\\" the umpire said,<br />Batter have to go back and sit down.<br />There are three chapters in HANNAH ARENDT, and the third has 219 notes.  Basic statistics on how much Julia Kristeva is merely educating herself in public by providing a reading from Arendt's books might be obtained by counting the Ibid.s.  Counting backwards, I found 133 Ibid.s in the notes for Chapter 3, including my favorite note:<br />\\"99.  \\"Letter to the Romans 7:21, drafted between 54 and 58 a.d., cited in ibid., p. 64.\\"  (p. 268).<br />A lot of the books I read lately keep trying to tell me when the Bible was written, but I never noticed it in a note before.  Usually my favorite notes are about Nietzsche, like:<br />\\"123.  Ibid., p. 165, citing Nietzsche, THE GAY SCIENCE, no. 310\\"<br />\\"126.  Concerning the `forgetting' that Nietzsche revives see p. 237; and Paul Ricoeur, paper presented at the Hannah Arendt Conference at the Grande Bibliotheque de France, December 6, 1997.\\"<br />\\"128.  Ibid., pp. 169-70, citing Nietzsche, THE WILL TO POWER, no. 585 A, pp. 316-19.\\"<br />`131.  LM, \\"Willing,\\" p. 172, citing Nietzsche, THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA, pt. 3, \\"Before Sunrise.\\" '<br />`187.  Ibid., citing Nietzsche, \\"The Use and Abuse of History,\\" pp. 6, 7.'<br />\\"189.

Ibid., pp. 63, 72-73 (\\"even in old Kant:  the categorical imperative reeks of cruelty\\").'<br />Nietzsche wrote such things about Kant, and it is a bit difficult to imagine that Kristeva and Arendt would associate such ideas with the great weight of the past if Nietzsche hadn't made this connection first.  Understanding philosophy is a process that can be compared to intellectually building a rehash of old, familiar plays, as if it is about something like a baseball game, which has an umpire who gets to decide when an easy pop fly is an infield fly rule call that makes the batter out, but the umpire does not have time to say anything until after it is all over when a triple play picks off the runners before they have a chance to tag up if the pitcher ducks under a line drive that gets caught right on second base before anyone has time to react, but a quick shortstop snagged the ball out of the air and flipped it to first in the only instant in which that could happen.  Kristeva is capable of interpreting political science as an activity best understood in terms of the philosophy of Nietzsche:<br />\\"To the `identical will' that forges the solidarity of a group, Arendt contrasts the way men who are connected to one another through a mutual promise `act in concert.'  These men dispose of the future as though it were the present, and they live together in the miraculous enlargement of what Nietzsche called the `memory of the Will,' which is what distinguishes human life from animal life.  As Arendt evokes Nietzsche's concept, she hears only the joyful touches of the superman and denotes not a trace of Nietzsche's disdainful tone.\\"(p. 236).<br />Still counting backward, I find 102 Ibid.s in the notes for Chapter 2 and only 52 Ibid.s in the notes for Chapter 1.  The Introduction only had two notes, on a wide variety of topics, but both related to the nature of \\"genius.\\"  When political opinion surveys offer a few sample views to encompass the political orientation of the great mass of the population, only a genius could be expected to have a ready answer to questions like \\"Will mothers become our only safeguard against the wholesale automation of human beings?\\"  (p. xiii).

His belated defense of Osip Mandelstam's poem about Stalin was that &quot;He simply could not resist crying out like a child.&quot;  (p. 265).  The Prologue starts with a telegram to Comrade Brezhnev in August 1968, when Yevtushenko was 35 and had written the poem, &quot;Do the Russians Want War?&quot; which became a popular antiwar ballad.  As an author maintaining his belief in his work, he wanted Brezhnev to know that the Soviet tanks which rolled into Prague on August 21, 1968 had created a moral duty for him to express an opinion based on his personal reactions.  &quot;For me, this is also a personal tragedy because I have many friends in Czechoslovakia and I do not know how I will be able to look them in the eye, how I will ever dare to face them again.&quot;  (p. 3).  Short, as most telegrams are, it is followed by &quot;Speech at the First Congress of People's Deputies (June 1989)&quot; (pp. 5-11), which shows Yevtushenko as a representative from Kharkov, a university city in Ukraine,  &quot;where there is an intelligent working class and a truly working intelligentsia&quot; (p. 8), trying to amend the Constitution to state:<br />&quot;Citizens of the USSR, independent of their party, state, or social position, have only equal rights with all the other workers in the sphere of consumer services and health care.  The existence in open or hidden form of privileged special stores, pharmacies, and hospitals should be considered an anticonstitutional violation of the principles of socialist equality.&quot;  (p. 8).<br />Trying to convince the Party members that their exercise of power had been far too self-serving, he told them that they represented only &quot;close to twenty million Party members in our country.  But we have close to one hundred million adults who are not Party members!&quot; (p. 9).  Insisting that the Party's majority in the Congress of People's Deputies was far too proud of itself, Yevtushenko told them:<br />&quot;Wasn't there that haughtiness, comrades, that Party self-congratulation and self-glorification, when the portraits of leaders, and the slogans &quot;Glory to the CPSU&quot; and so on contrasted with the killing of millions of workers, with personal corruption, with the collapse of the economy, with the death of our boys in Afghanistan?&quot;  (p. 9).<br />War is not the major topic in this book, but it has been a factor in the transformation of some individuals.  I like the post-Chernobyl repudiation of &quot;The criminal amateurishness of overblown authorities, who united in a mafialike conspiracy,&quot;  (p. 68), like recent attempts to impose some lawful control seem to dominate most political thinking about that part of the world so far in this century.  There are ten pages of Index for this book, and only 12 lines in the index are devoted to topics between walruses and the Warsaw Pact.  My interest in his views on the Vietnam war are subordinate to his understanding that &quot;Part of our youth does not believe the adults -- and we deserve that.  The insufficient participation of young people in today's revolution is also our fault.&quot;  (p. 28).  I would blame it on a society which only instills entertainment values, so that any person who is not pleased with a present activity is expected to opt to do something else.  &quot;Some young people leave in the middle of the movie `Repentance.'  As if to say, what does it have to do with us?  But real culture requires a people to accept all its country's history, all its guilt. . . . The best segments of American society created a public outcry at home so that their troops had to get out of Vietnam.&quot;  (pp. 28-29).  This praises free world ethics, not our economics.  There is a real danger of being overly hyper and having a fit, if too sensitive to incriminating outrageousness.  &quot;Many young people are embarrassed to show their feelings.  They are afraid of being accused of sentimentality. . . . We hear more and more frequently about the inexplicable pathological cruelty of adolescents.&quot;  (p. 29).  The army is the perfect example of where any kid might want to escape from Yevtushenko's logic.<br />&quot;Here's my hypothesis:  if our self-genocide had not destroyed so many thinkers and harvesters, there might not have been the Chernobyl apocalypse, or the accident with the Nakhimov, or the explosions in the Arzama, or in Sverdlovsk, or the train fire near Bologoi, or the destruction of the Aral Sea.  All this destruction was caused by the destruction of professionalism.&quot;  (p. 68).<br />It is extremely difficult to believe how careless people become when they are responsible for doing things 24 hours a day while most of the world has far too little to do.  The great part of this book is about the Russian cultural heritage.  Tolstoy is described as hopelessly the same as his character Anna Karenina.  &quot;The deeply religious Tolstoy became anticlerical and he was excommunicated from the church for `heresy.'  The religious Anna is choking on disgust for religious hypocrisy.&quot;  (p. 270).<br />&quot;Tolstoy had elevated the concept of `family' to a personal moral church, but became disillusioned in it, too, because under the scenery of so-called mutual respect he saw the death of love. . . .  Almost all the faces that pass before her eyes irritate Anna before her suicide:  `Why are they talking, why are they laughing?  It's not true, it's all a lie, all deceit.'&quot;  (p. 271).  &quot;Tolstoy's rebellion began apparently right after the Crimean War, which transformed him.&quot;  (p. 271).eal culture requires a people to accept all its country's history, all its guilt. . . .

US	41560427	RTHRJP7JHRIZ6	0791432726	505337486	Novalis: Philosophical Writings	Books	4	16	42	N	N	Not another Nagasaki	Early in the Introduction, Margaret Mahony Stoljar proclaims, &quot;In his original, unprejudiced, and undogmatic questioning of any issue that interests him, Novalis displays to a remarkable degree the kind of innovative thought that will characterize the Romantic movement throughout Europe.  Being a practicing scientist and creative writer as well as possessing a comprehensive approach to theoretical inquiry that in his time was what was meant by `philosophical,' Novalis engages with a wider spectrum of questions than do most of his contemporaries.  But it is his readiness to subject any philosophical concept to radical interrogation that marks his published and unpublished work as of enduring interest.  For contemporary readers accustomed to the critique of the categories of reason that has followed in the wake of Nietzsche, Novalis's writings can seem uncannily pertinent.  They address issues that in recent years have continued to expand the parameter of our thinking on truth and objectivity, language and mind, symbol and representation, reason and the imagination.  In form and style too, Novalis's manuscripts demonstrate the associative fluidity of thought characteristic of Nietzsche.&quot;  (pp. 1-2).  There are no entires in the index for Nietzsche and Derrida.  In this translation, Novalis sees philosophy as a progression from passive thinking to magical idealism, at least in number 33 of the Teplitz Fragments:<br />&quot;An empiricist is:  one whose way of thinking is an effect of the external world and of fate--the passive thinker--to whom his philosophy is given.  Voltaire is a pure empiricist and so are several French philosophers--Ligne tends imperceptibly to the transcendent empiricists.  These make the transition to the dogmatists.  From there the way leads to the enthusiasts--or the transcendent dogmatists--then to Kant--then to Fichte--and finally to magical idealism.&quot;  (p. 107).<br />There is not much of a story in what happened to Novalis because he died young, in March 1801, while Kant (1724-1804) was still alive.  By the time Novalis published POLLEN in the winter of 1797-1798, Kant had accepted a ban on publicly speaking or writing about religion, but he was about to declare that he did not consider the ban binding after the death of King Frederick William II in 1797.  Novalis's first fiancee, Sophie, died in March 1797 at the age of fifteen.  &quot;King Frederick William III and Queen Luise of Prussia ascended the throne at the end of 1797.&quot;  (p. 16).  Papers were eager to publish anything that would make this look like a great event, and soon thereafter &quot;Novalis had already achieved a degree of notoriety as a political thinker with his second published collection of fragments, FAITH AND LOVE OR THE KING AND QUEEN, which appeared in July 1798 in the Berlin journal `Yearbooks of the Prussian Monarchy.'&quot;  (p. 16).<br />Frankly, the attitude I find most clearly in FAITH AND LOVE OR THE KING AND QUEEN reminds me of the works of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772), who had a doctrine of correspondences that arose from a spirit similar to a selection on the first page of this work by Novalis:<br />&quot;4.  One finds what one loves everywhere, and sees similarities everywhere.  The greater the love the more extensive and manifold is this similar world.  My beloved is the abbreviation of the universe, the universe is the extension of my beloved.  To the lover of learning, all its branches offer garlands and remembrances for his beloved.&quot;  (p. 85).<br />Finding ourselves in a modern world, in which shock and awe have become the standard tactic for dealing with anyone who has claimed kingly powers for too long, and a people who have always been promised perfect innocence are often driven to wipe the slate clean after observing the monster which has been created since the preceding last act, thinking about royal situations, we are apt to remember the incineration of Nagasaki, near the end of World War Two, as a gift to the emperor of Japan, which would allow him to openly advocate unconditional surrender without any loss of face, because atomic bombs represented a power superior to anything that a mere royal highness might possess.  Most readers might leave such thoughts unthunk, but this book is a blend of political thinking with poetic power that stumbles mainly because it can no longer be our book.  Death is in the index, and mentioned early in this book's first selections, MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS:<br />&quot;11.  Death is a victory over the self--which, like all self-conquest, brings about a new, easier existence.&quot;  (p. 24).<br />This might not be true for people who try to talk about it.rld War Two, as a gift to the emperor of Japan, which would allow him to openly advocate unconditional surrender without any loss of face, because atomic bombs represented a power superior to anything that a mere royal highness might possess.

US	41560427	RSKY92HN50XFH	0521599644	196007348	Kant: Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason: And Other Writings (Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy)	Books	4	10	18	N	N	An interesting combination of concepts	The first essay in this book, published in a scholarly journal before many of Kant's key works had been written, established that Kant wanted to have his views on reason and truth considered by his age when controversial matters were being discussed.  As he became more famous, the censor became an obstacle to having Kant's ideas published in such a popular vehicle.  While religion can be a topic that is generally written about in a safe manner, it is possible to imagine Kant breathing fire into the final parts of this book as a direct result of restrictions, which then resulted in an order for his silence on the topic of religion for several years.<br />According to the Chronology on pages xxxiii-xxxiv, the works that are included in this book were originally published in 1786, 1791, 1792, 1793, and 1794.  Also important were the death of Frederick the Great in 1786 and a royal letter in 1794 objecting to Kant's writings on religion, which Kant obeyed at least until, after he retired from university lecturing in 1796, he felt his situation had changed after King Frederick William II died in 1797.  The first text in this book, &quot;What does it mean to orient oneself in thinking?&quot; was in response to a pantheism controversy published in the `Berlinische Monatsschrift.'  Part one of RELIGION WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF MERE REASON was published in the same journal in 1792, but the second part was rejected by the censor in Berlin.  The book as a whole had to be published as philosophy instead of theology.<br />Part One started with the evil in the world, with Kant's first footnote a Latin verse by Horace that is translated:  &quot;The age of our parents (who were worse than our forefathers) brought us forth yet more dishonest, and we are now ready to issue an even more vicious progeny.&quot;  (p. 45, n. g).  By the end of the first part, Kant was willing to say some good things about Christianity, but only if it could conform to his moral principles.  &quot;According to moral religion, however (and of all the public religions so far known, the Christian alone is of this type), it is a fundamental principle that, to become a better human being, everyone must do as much as it is in his powers to do; and only then, if a human being has not buried his innate talent (Luke 19:12-16), if he has made use of the original predisposition to the good in order to become a better human being, can he hope that what does not lie in his power will be made good by cooperation from above.&quot;  (p. 71).  The original Part Two starts on page 77, but the book had four parts, and by the time Kant got to the second half of Part Four, I'll bet he was steaming.  Every time he called something the second part, he had an overwhelming urge to belittle the forces of religion which were imposing restrictions upon him:<br />&quot;Second Section, The Christian Religion as a Learned Religion.&quot;  (p. 160).<br />&quot;Second Part, Concerning the counterfeit service of God in a statutory religion.&quot;  (p. 164).<br />&quot;Section 2, The Moral Principle of Religion Opposed to the Delusion of Religion.&quot;  (p. 166).<br />After RELIGION WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF MERE REASON, the final text in the book is called &quot;The end of all things.&quot;  (pp. 193-205).  This is not the ultimate picture of fire and brimstone.  When Kant quotes Revelations 10:5-6, his interpretation is &quot;that henceforth time shall be no more.&quot;  (p. 200).  Kant attempts to be comforting, though he is still sure that human activities will always be found wanting by any rational evaluation.  &quot;The end of all things which go through the hands of human beings, even when their purposes are good, is folly, i.e. the use of means to their ends which are directly opposed to these ends.  Wisdom . . . dwells in God alone; . . . Hence too the projects - altering from age to age and often absurd - of finding suitable means to make religion in a whole people pure and at the same time powerful, so that one can well cry out:  Poor mortals, with you nothing is constant except inconstancy!&quot;  (p. 202).  This was good enough to be published in a scholarly journal in June, 1794, but &quot;In October Kant receives a royal letter, signed by Woellner for the King, objecting to Kant's writings on religion and ordering him to avoid offending in this area in the future&quot;  (p. xxxiv).  He had no need to force everyone to agree with him, so he agreed not to speak or write publicly on religion.  He was familiar with the New Testament, but his tendency to declare, &quot;Here now appears a remarkable antimony of human reason with itself, the resolution of which - or, if this is not possible, at least its settlement - can alone determine whether a historical (ecclesiastical) faith must always supervene as an essential portion of saving faith over and above the religious one, or whether, as mere vehicle, historical faith will finally pass over, in however distant a future, into pure religious faith&quot; (p. 123) is a bit much.rful, so that one can well cry out:  Poor mortals, with you nothing is constant except inconstancy!&quot;  (p. 202).

Few people would be able to produce a coherent consideration of our fundamental emotional states with so many references to Aristotle, Edmund Burke, Charles Darwin, Immanuel Kant, Plato, Shakespeare, Sophocles, Spinoza, and William Wordsworth.  My favorite part of the author index was 21 lines devoted to H-names:  Hegel, Heidegger, Albert O. Hirschman, Hobbes, Homer, and Hume.  Hegel is barely mentioned, for &quot;Hegel's famous parable of the master and the slave, a parable of fear in which, to save his life, one combatant surrenders and becomes the slave of another, constituting the other as master.  With this act begins all of human culture and history.&quot;  (p. 124).  Modern readers might think it had far more important economic consequences, enabling the mindless rich to forget all that whenever it suited them, once things started to go smoothly enough to enable popularity to be determined by entertainment values in a society in which being fab counts for a lot more than being productive.  This book is heavy with what the people who keep trying to imagine the world solely as the home of billions of shoppers don't know.<br />Economic considerations get an early jab in this book's consideration of how an early poem, Homer's ILIAD, shows how &quot;leaders goad, insult, or create anger in the fighters so that something stronger than fear will block fear or make it less likely.  This important feature by which the passions can be controlled by preemption has been elaborated in an extraordinary way by Albert Hirschman in his classic study of thirty years ago, THE PASSIONS AND THE INTERESTS.  Political society, Hirschman observes, has a deep interest in becoming, first and foremost, an economy, because avarice is the single one of the passions that requires conditions that block out the interruptive, short-term episodes of anger, grief, falling in love, or any other disruption of the smooth unfolding of the predictable future. . . .  Episodes of passion within the individual resemble the state of war or a natural disaster in public life.  Normal life is suspended for a time, and the pursuit of individual and common interests is set aside.  Hirschman has described how our modern political life that identifies each person or group with his, her, or their interests, rather than with passions, permits a brushing aside of the passions and their disruptive effect in social life, while ultimately honoring the one remaining passion of avarice with its link to a stable world of effort.&quot;  (pp. 33-34).<br />Mortality plays a much larger role than comedy (and Nietzsche is not mentioned at all) in this book.  Humor is reduced to being a reaction to harmless variations of the usual comic bits, far removed from our normal expectation that evil can be gleefully destroyed.  &quot;The scale that I have evoked here extends from comedy and laughter at harmless evils, evils without consequence, to evils that have consequences on a familiar scale where we feel pity, sympathy, and fear, to, finally, the shudder of terror we feel at the larger unraveling of the world in cascading consequences, unique in their severity and finality, and so disproportionate to the initial cause that the subsequent events terrify us about causality itself.&quot;  (pp. 38-39).  The Stoics get credit for being at the beginning of our intellectual tradition in this field.  &quot;But Stoicism was at war with the passions and viewed them as suffering rooted in false belief.  The Stoics contrasted passions with actions, bending an earlier history back against itself.&quot;  (p. 5).  Our intimate familiarity with gothic novels and frightful movies &quot;or any other fear-based form uses most of the inner details of the fear experience, among them suddenness, surprise, dilated experiences of time, and nearly unbearable suspense in the moments of pause before the dreaded thing at last happens.&quot;  (p. 9).  Consideration of the emotions that readers and spectators feel help create sophisticated expectations for &quot;the shape of time . . . the familiar arc and pace of time within the vehement states themselves.  Wonder, anger, grief, and fear reveal different ways that time is rushed, dilated, ordered, and used up.  Works of art modeled on those states follow distinct recipes for the use of time.&quot;  (p. 9).  &quot;Literature's reliance on moments of experience, rather than summary, generalization, or long perspectives of time, gives to vehement states an important position as one central matter for literature.  This includes the fact that the duration of such states and their consequences, the time span of rage and its immediate consequences, the time span of falling in love and its immediate consequences, of grief and its immediate consequences, happens to match the particular kind of timescale on which literature operates best.&quot;  (pp. 21-22).<br />Chapter 2, Paths among the Passions, includes an intellectual assessment.  &quot;No topic in our culture shows such persistence and self-identity even in passing through the phase of Christian theology as the account of the passions of the soul from the time of Homer, Plato, and Aristotle to the edge of modernity with Descartes, Spinoza, Hobbes, and Hume, and then continuing in the later reprise of this work in Darwin and modern scientific psychology.&quot;  (pp. 32-33).  By the time the book gets to Chapter 6, Rashness, &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; gets to share the stage with &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; on page 95.  Chapter 7, Mutual Fear, finds, &quot;The ultimate usefulness of fear for a theory of political life increases within modernity.&quot;  (p. 113).

US	41560427	R18W7SW873C24Z	0802224369	212112265	The Will to Doubt	Books	3	8	15	N	N	An old example of modern thought	Published in 1958, reprinted in 1986, THE WILL TO DOUBT by Bertrand Russell has a great analysis of Fichte's &quot;Addresses to the German Nation&quot; of 1807 on pages 93-98 in an essay called &quot;The Ancestry of Fascism.&quot;  Still, this book already shows some capacity to outlive its moment in time.  Jokes have a short life span, but the underlying incongruities that make some concepts funny keep cropping up, whenever a comedian looking for new material in current events casts an eye back to the classic approach for undercutting pompous views that Russell frequently referred to as religious.  There is certainly no indication in THE WILL TO DOUBT that the concept *Jewish settlements* was considered funny in 1958, but the approach which Russell recommends for thinking through spurious attitudes seems to work just as well as any jest against the idea that *Jewish settlements* will ever settle anything.<br />First essay:  &quot;Can Men Be Rational?&quot; (pp. 9-16).  After stating &quot;I have a very high respect for psycho-analysis, and I believe it can be enormously useful,&quot; (p. 12), Russell suggests:  &quot;A closely similar method can cure the irrationalities of those who are not recognized lunatics, provided they will submit to treatment by a practitioner free from their delusions.  Presidents, Cabinet Ministers, and Eminent Persons, however, seldom fulfil this condition, and therefore remain uncured.&quot;  (p. 13).  Jewish settlements might be considered a symptom of whatever Russell would like to have cured in this case, as Jewish settlements only seem to become an issue when they exist someplace where they are set in the midst of their enemies.  Having Jewish settlements is a reminder &quot;that in such matters it is impossible to be objective, and that no method is possible except a tug-of-war between classes with opposite bias.&quot;  (p. 14).  Russell would like to crumble this cookie by writing, &quot;Education, the press, politics, religion--in a word, all the great forces in the world--are at present on the side of irrationality; they are in the hands of men who flatter King Demos in order to lead him astray.&quot;  (p. 16).<br />Second Essay:  &quot;Free Thought and Official Propaganda&quot;  (pp. 17-37).  By considering the Blasphemy Laws, Russell tells people what each country would like people to believe.  &quot;In America no one can enter the country without first solemnly declaring that he disbelieves in anarchism and polygamy; and, once inside, he must also disbelieve in communism.&quot;  (p. 18).  Russell must have been feeling like he had been deported on those very grounds himself, after having a few too many ideas, wives, and sympathies with enemies foreign and domestic.  Adding to the confusion:  &quot;There was a time when Protestantism seemed as wicked as Bolshevism seems now.  Please do not infer from this that I am either a Protestant or a Bolshevik.&quot;  (p. 19).  Russell is ready for a world in which &quot;War would become impossible, because each side would realize that both sides must be in the wrong.&quot;  (p. 22).<br />History is awful enough that certain people are sure to try something new to escape it, but this book has no way to keep people from forming Jewish settlements, if that is what they think will change things in the way they want them changed.  Russell thought Einstein was lucky to come up with ideas in science instead of religion.  &quot;What would have happened if Einstein had advanced something equally new in the sphere of religion or politics?  English people would have found elements of Prussianism in his theory; anti-Semites would have regarded it as a Zionist plot; nationalists in all countries would have found it tainted with lily-livered pacifism, and proclaimed it a mere dodge for escaping military service.  All the old-fashioned professors would have approached Scotland Yard to get the importation of his writings prohibited. . . .&quot;  (p. 23).  Russellmanaged to mention &quot;Zionist plot&quot; without asking whether the Bible might have any evidence on what a plot by Zionists could accomplish.  Even Russell's look at economics provides similar instances.  &quot;The tendency, which exists wherever industrialism is well developed, for trusts and monopolies to control all industry, leads to a diminution of the number of possible employers, so it becomes easier and easier to keep secret black books by means of which any one not subservient to the great corporations can be starved.&quot;  (p. 32).<br />Intellectual servitude has such a long and distinguished history, it hardly takes a monopoly employer to impose uniformly servile views on employees when it comes to information about anything which does not pertain to making big bucks.  Anti-discrimination law has stepped in to protect Americans from &quot;The habit of considering a man's religious, moral, and political opinions before appointing him to a post or giving him a job&quot; which Russell called &quot;the modern form of persecution, and it is likely to become quite as efficient as the Inquisition ever was.&quot;  (p. 33).  On this point, Russell is afraid &quot;even the most orthodox of us may find himself in a minority some day, so that we all have an interest in restraining the tyranny of majorities.&quot;  (p. 34).  Any point of view that hurts both sides might be &quot;due to moral defects as much as to lack of intelligence.  But the human race has not hitherto discovered any method of eradicating moral defects; preaching and exhortation only add hypocrisy to the previous list of vices.&quot;  (p. 35).  Knowing how much the world can now be fooled, all for the worse, leads Russell to the conclusion:  &quot;Credulity is a greater evil in the present day than it ever was before.&quot;  (p. 35).  &quot;Hence the increase in the circulation of newspapers.&quot;  (p. 36).  The less people are capable of paying attention to who really uses their weapons of mass destruction, the more Russell begins to seem a bit quaint with his complaint:  &quot;The results of science, in the form of mechanism, poison gas, and the yellow press, bid fair to lead to the total downfall of our civilization.&quot;  (p. 36).managed to mention &quot;Zionist plot&quot; without asking whether the Bible might have any evidence on what a plot by Zionists could accomplish.

They were secretly engaged for seven years, until Jenny was 29, before Karl Marx had a position with a newspaper that promised to pay him enough that he could afford to marry.  A single sentence in the first paragraph of the Introduction provides the information that the rest of the book confirms in great detail:  &quot;She shared the misery of his refugee existence, copied his illegible manuscripts, fought off his creditors, prepared his meals and bore him seven children.&quot;  (p. xiii).  The book furnishes many examples of her devotion to Karl Marx.  She wrote letters, many of which are quoted in the text, and the ten pages of notes following the Bibliography do little more than provide page numbers in works that are mostly in German.  Even the citations for reviews by Jenny of Shakespeare's plays, published anonymously in the Frankfurter Zeitung in February 1877, are to a German source.<br />Newspapers had an odd appeal to Karl Marx as a source of income, as a medium for spreading democratic ideals, and he was often frustrated by authorities who would not allow them to be used as a rallying cry for communism and uniting workers in revolution.  While Jenny and the shareholders who might provide money for a newspaper could agree with Marx getting money for writing articles that supported freedom of speech, Karl's interest in overthrowing the capitalists in general was often enough reason for the Prussian authorities to shut down his newspapers and force him into exile.  Even his job as a foreign correspondent, writing articles for an American newspaper, could not be depended upon, &quot;because Karl lost half his income in 1857 as a result of the American economic crisis.&quot;  (p. 119).  After spending some early years in Paris, Chapter 6, Exile in Brussels, and Chapter 8, The Hells of London, emphasize how tough the situation at home was for Jenny, who was usually stuck at home or visiting her mother.<br />The situation of the rest of Jenny's family tends to show that Karl Marx was not the only person who had trouble finding a steady source of income.  Jenny's father was a Prussian civil servant who was transferred to Trier when Jenny was two.  He enjoyed the culture that a town of 12,000 could provide, but he hardly offered any solutions to their problems.  &quot;In his reports to Berlin her father frequently pointed out that there was `great and growing poverty among the lowest classes' of Trier and the surrounding countryside, but when Berlin asked him what caused it, he failed to provide an answer.&quot;  (p. 11).  Though Karl Marx was younger than Jenny, he impressed her as being more interested in such serious matters than the other young men she had contact with.  Karl dedicated &quot;his first publication, his PhD thesis&quot; (p. 15) to Jenny's father.  Jenny had a brother, Edgar, who pondered the same problems.  Unable to find a position in Germany that coincided with his views, Edgar went to Texas and failed in a typical fashion.  Later Jenny wrote, &quot;He has taken part in the war in Texas for three years and has suffered beyond description; he lost everything, everything, including his health.  He is now here to recover a bit; he will then go to Berlin to my brother and his relatives and try his luck there.&quot;  (p. 142).  He seemed to have a great need for food.  Marx wrote about his expensive guest to Engels, &quot;this Edgar, who never exploited anyone except himself, and who was always a workman in the strictest sense of the word, endured a war of, and with starvation for the slaveholders.  Ditto that we two brothers-in-law are being ruined momentarily by the American War.&quot;  (p. 143).  The American Civil War and its aftermath had become the sole interest of newspaper readers in the United States, and Marx could no longer get anything by writing for Americans.<br />Even for the great masterpiece on Capital, when a publisher was found, &quot;The manuscript had to be written up, of course, then copied into legible hand by Jenny and that always took longer than planned.&quot;  (p. 122).  Marx was still complaining about his situation in a letter to Engels.  &quot;'Since my wife cannot make Christmas preparations for the children herself, but is bothered instead with unpaid bills from all sides, has to copy my manuscript and in between run downtown to the pawnshops, the mood is extremely gloomy'.  Engels answer was 5 pounds sterling and a Christmas basket, filled with bottles of port, sherry and champagne.&quot;  (p. 122).  Money from the textile business of the firm Ermen &amp; Engels, originally owned by Engels's father, was often used to rescue the Marx family, until Engels sold his shares and retired.  Other family matters discussed in this book are typical for politically active people who suddenly achieve fame, as Karl Marx did as the defender of the workers of Paris who formed the Commune in March 1871, after Napoleon III had been taken prisoner in the battle of Sedan on 2 September 1870.  (pp. 154-155).  One of his daughters lost her job as a tutor for the Monroes, an English family, and the International was condemned in France, but Jenny struck back by writing an obituary for Gustave Florens.

After three Marx daughters were arrested in France, Jenny wrote, &quot;I am afraid that we, we older ones, won't live to see many good things.&quot;  (p. 158).sher was found, &quot;The manuscript had to be written up, of course, then copied into legible hand by Jenny and that always took longer than planned.&quot;  (p. 122).

This book fails to live up to any comic potential that might be created by the title, THE IRONY OF REFORM.  Our past is presented as merely a small episode in an almost unpopulated nation having a federal government with a tiny budget and few domestic programs just a century ago, suddenly pushed into the position of a global superpower whose economic potential seems to strip meaning from the activity of anyone who would dare to become part of its political system.  Along the way, a few court decisions were considered significant, but the number of cases has grown so drastically that even the judges can't keep up.  Though the federal judiciary was only 262 in 1945, &quot;The number of judges then grew to more than 500 in the early 1970s, to 657 by the end of that decade, and 875 by 1990,&quot; (p. 142) most of the opinions are produced largely by those at a lower level.  &quot;Judges now do little of their own research, and many judges do little original writing.&quot;  (p. 143).  Putting words on paper has become a chore best assigned to &quot;people who have less political and practical experience than even the judges themselves. . . . In some instances, it is to be feared, they are indeed invisible judges, for there are appellate judges whose literary style appears to change annually.&quot;  (p. 144).  With life tenure, federal judges don't have to worry about the constant running for re-election that House members with two-year terms face.  &quot;With terms so short, every vote a legislator casts becomes a kind of minireferendum on her or his electability--or at least fundability.  There is virtually no latitude for representatives to think in broad national terms.&quot;  (p. 187).<br />The economic changes which are deemed important in THE IRONY OF REFORM are fundamental to understanding how so many people can be involved in activities that depend so much on cash flow.  Combining this consideration with the drop in popularity that most presidents have experienced since Roosevelt and Truman exceeded 75 percent approval in 1944, kind of hard to imagine since Johnson made the big slide from 1964 to 1968, as shown in Figure 5.3, Presidential Approval, Gallup Poll, 1938-1995, clearly supports the statement:<br />&quot;The postwar presidents have typically lost support as their terms wore on.  The majority of them, in fact, have lost so much support that they were forced from office--by resigning, declining to seek reelection, or losing to electoral challengers.&quot;  (pp. 124).  The difference in popularity on that chart between Kennedy and Clinton is astounding.  Truman's drop after 1948 was almost as bad as Nixon's ratings after 1972.  Eisenhower was popular, but Kennedy started so high people must have been thinking he was better than Eisenhower had ever been.  Truman and Johnson were at the highest points on the chart when they took over after the deaths of Roosevelt and Kennedy, and hope must have been a major component of their approval, because nothing they ever did was capable of making them as popular as they were in the beginning.  Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan all started so low that Clinton should not have to feel bad about barely being more popular than where the original President Bush ended up.  I would blame Johnson, for getting votes in 1964 from people who would not even think about voting for anyone for president after what he did, and then letting people think that he would run for reelection in 1968, not announcing that he was not a candidate until March 31, 1968, and almost backing Nixon instead of Humphrey in the 1968 campaign.  The outrage of Democrats who opposed that kind of political power caused the reform in &quot;Presidential Nominations&quot; covered on pages 44-50, and Congress after the 1958 election was already changing in that direction, as described in Chapter 4, The Congress We Love To Hate.  (pp. 67-95).  Control of Congress is such a second-order effect, possibly an issue for individual voters who know how parties make decisions in Washington, D.C., but rarely important enough to think that the American Constitution will ever be changed to produce a system in which &quot;In each house, 20 percent of the members should be appointed on the sole authority of the president.&quot;  (p. 185).  Mackenzie thinks this might bring in a few &quot;former presidents, former secretaries of state, distinguished former civil servants or ambassadors, policy experts, former governors, business leaders, intellectuals.&quot;  (p. 186).  I would not expect the intellectuals to be any higher on the president's list.  How many days was it, after the special election October 7, 2003, in California, until the president had a public meeting with the movie star governor elect from Austria?  Even if California needs money, that might be easier to manage than an intellectual.<br />Published in 1996, this book still maintains the possibility of some changes.  For those of us who think things might be worse with a single party in the White House, controlling the Senate, and having a strong majority in the House of Representatives, the biggest irony might be in considering whether this is a train wreck waiting to happen or already stalemated by the economic reality which uses weakness in the system of government to impose its bias in favor of uncontrolled economic growth whenever it is threatened, as when &quot;Someone has to run the show, and in Congress, for most of the period since 1970, no one has.&quot;  (p. 192).

The idea that philosophy is merely a professional field in which rivals compete over who has a rationally systematic form of competence within a political system that bears little relevance to the world as it usually is, full of events that hardly maintain any notion of classical forms of reality, and often producing thoughts that stray far from rational systems, personal principles, or helpful advice, offers the novelist with some knowledge of this void a fertile field in which ideas can advance in unexpected directions.  The novel COSMOS by Witold Gombrowicz was published in Polish in 1965, translated into French and German, and Eric Mosbacher managed to produce the English version from the other translations in 1967.  It took me a long time to discover Witold Gombrowicz, and after reading that his modern viewpoint was much more comic than Sartre, I read PORNOGRAPHIA, which is a brilliant novel, originally published in Polish in 1960, first.  I was impressed by its picture of individual wartime strategies set in Nazi-occupied Poland, but I was slow to appreciate how COSMOS might offer a better appreciation of how society makes personal demands on many levels.  In the years that have passed since I finally read it, I have often thought that it could be a bitter lesson for young people who face the problem of shaping an individual personality to fit whatever job seems most appropriate for them in our society, which is becoming far too comic for this question to be answered seriously in a philosophical manner.<br />The beginning of COSMOS, with its hanged bird, \\"Its little head was bent and its mouth wide open,\\" (p. 10), was set in journalistic hyperbole.  The world could hardly search for significance in a scene in which \\"the bad road, and the ruts and lumps of earth and heels, trouser-legs, stones, and all this vegetation, all culminating like a crowd genuflecting before this hanged sparrow--reigning triumphant and eccentric over this outlandish spot.\\"  (p. 10).<br />Taking the title literally with such an opening scene suggests a work that will slog through a tremendous amount of irony on its way to some poetic justice.  In a comic society, the last laugh has to be what works best, and ultimately COSMOS is a guide to the nature of the character most likely to have the last laugh.  Though there are more people in this book than I can describe, I find that the comic elements can be traced with a few.<br />\\"Fuchs tramped on ahead and I followed behind.\\"  (p. 9).  Two men, described as \\"And so you two gentlemen are working for exams\\" (p. 15), looking for a good cheap place to stay, find a notice of rooms to let on a fence shortly after they saw the hanging sparrow.<br />\\"Mr Wojtys, a retired bank manager, complete with signet ring and gold cuff-links\\" (p. 14).  His daughter, \\"Lena was married.  Her husband appeared after we had started dinner.\\"  (p. 22).  They had been married two months and were living with her parents until their house was ready.<br />Director Krysinski, described by Leo Wojtys as demanding \\"incongruence or contrariety which, he maintained, every candidate for high position must have at his fingertips.\\"  (p. 40).  When Lena's husband Louis suggested \\"Rational organization of society and of the world,\\" (p. 46), Leo \\"splayed his fingers like the claws of a beast of prey, advanced them across the tablecloth, and then opened his hand and blew on it.  `One puff and it's gone, don't you see?' he said.  `Gone, just like that.' \\"  (p.46).<br />The narrator admits to \\"feeling pleasure as well as dismay, pleasure at having brought off a coup\\" (p. 70) after one surprising episode.  The entire household gathered to discuss what was going on.  \\"What a kettle of fish. . . .  He had no need to say any more to make us feel like a couple of pitiful beggars scratching about on a refuse heap.\\"  (p.76).<br />The key characters take an excursion to the mountains, joined by two other newlywed couples who were friends of Lena.  Finally the fun starts:<br />\\"Gradually things livened up in the carriage.  The newlyweds, who were called Lolo and Lola, grew more animated, and after a bout of preliminary exchanges such as `Oh, Lolo, have I forgotten the thermos?' and `Lola, take this bag, it's in my way,' they gave themselves up completely to lolery.\\"  (p. 95).  When they get to the mountains, the carriage picks up a priest who got lost on an excursion.  \\"He climbs into your carriage and you are confronted with sin.\\"  (p. 103).  A fine discussion of baths and washing on pages 110-111 is ended by a single comment which \\"cut right through the loloing of the Lolos,\\"  (p. 111).<br />Lena's mother does not approve of Lena's friends.  \\"Have you ever seen such a hussy?  She can't even leave a priest alone.\\"  (p. 134).  The pattern of the scattering of jokes was \\"the sticky honey of that triple honeymoon.\\"  (p. 136).  \\"The Lolos were going for Fuchs, but of course Jadeczka was their real target, Fuchs was only the cushion off which the billiard balls bounced, and he knew it, but he was delighted at being bombarded with their jokes;\\"  (p. 136).<br />It is the comic nature of society that makes the reader most likely to sympathize with those who find a way to enjoy themselves, and eventually feel relieved that the more serious elements of the plot do not involve them at all.  Something deeply disturbing is going on in this book, but social life takes place on another level, which seems to be difficult for the priest to enjoy.  Events of a darker nature form a \\"series like a, b, c, d or 1, 2, 3, 4.  What consistency, what subterranean logic.

Humboldt had been put in charge of sweeping reforms of the educational system, though he had been educated mainly by tutors &quot;at home, and he studied less than two years at two German universities.&quot;  (p. 86).  He devised entrance examinations, and &quot;Humboldt appears to have ignored the question of the education of females altogether.&quot;  (p. 87).  The reforms by Prussia at the time of Napoleon, in which Humboldt took part in seeking new intellectual advances by German society as a whole, governed by philosophy in a way that had not been officially true before, is subject to a broader look at the same topic in the section &quot;Idealists as University Reformers&quot; on pages 646-650 of THE SOCIOLOGY OF PHILOSOPHIES by Randall Collins, who gives much more credit to the philosopher Fichte, who did not get mentioned in A PICTORIAL HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGY.  There is more fun in A PICTORIAL HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGY than in most books on philosophy: the last section in Part I on the topic, Thinking Animals, has a &quot;Caricature of Krall and his school for horses.&quot;  (p. 81).  Also, see the picture of &quot;Henny Jutzler-Kindermann chatting with her dog Schlump by means of a letter board (ca. 1938).&quot;  (p. 82).<br />The Subject Index has a single entry for feminism, in the section on Lou Andreas-Salome:  Feminist and Psychoanalyst (pp. 406-412).  As an author and psychoanalyst, her views on the people she met in her life remain vivid and interesting.  She is not included in the &quot;Caricatures of nine psychoanalysts&quot; on page 414, but four of those pictured at an International Psycho-Analytical Association meeting in Salzburg, Austria, in April, 1924, were women.  There is a section on Maria Montessori on pages 326-328.  Also, &quot;Martha Muchow's Concept of Lifespace&quot;  (pp. 337-341) is before the section on Jean Piaget (pp. 342-347).<br />People who have little appreciation for Europe and its intellectuals might still be interested in reading about Georg Groddeck on pages 420-423, who is introduced as &quot;a passionate opponent of the medical science of his day.&quot;  (p. 420).  &quot;His excellent skills as a public speaker and persuasive writer led to the publication of his provocative psychoanalytic novel, THE SOUL SEEKER (1921), and his classic BOOK OF THE IT (1923).&quot;  (pp. 420-421).  The novel expresses an intellectual quest that Lawrence Durrell called &quot;the Groddeckian system.  I can see what a tremendous effect it will have in the future--for the future belongs to Groddeck.  Freud's part is the calculus, Groddeck's is the attitude.  Ah!  If only we had known about him in Paris! (letter [to Henry Miller], February 28, 1946).&quot;  (p. 422).<br />Those who are interested in how much philosophy has influenced psychology might want to know that A PICTORIAL HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGY has a section in Part I on &quot;Brentano:  Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint&quot; (pp. 61-65) and a section:  &quot;William James:  America's Premier Psychologist.&quot; (pp. 66-70).  Attempts to link philosophy to psychology in the more modern sections of this book appear to be most apt at the beginning of the section &quot;Antipsychiatry and Antihistory:  `Nailing Jelly to the Wall' &quot; (pp. 545-462).  Foucault and Szasz are &quot;associated with what has been termed a social movement of the 1960s.&quot;  (p. 454).  Believing &quot;Critical thinking has its greatest effects in producing change when its proponents come from within theirown circle,&quot;  (p. 455), leads to &quot;Laing used schizophrenia as a metophor for late 20th-century society--specifically the paranoia and hysteria informing every aspect of it. . . . we are more sick than those we diagnose as schizophrenic because we are completely cut off from a large part of ourselves.  In fact, we may actually make those we diagnose as schizophrenic into scapegoats for our unconscious feelings of paranoia.&quot;  (pp. 459-460).  Modern philosophy has become a way of expressing such views on intellectual singleness of mind, but don't expect to find any quotes of Emerson about foolish consistencies in this book to prove it.own circle,&quot;  (p. 455), leads to &quot;Laing used schizophrenia as a metophor for late 20th-century society--specifically the paranoia and hysteria informing every aspect of it. . . . we are more sick than those we diagnose as schizophrenic because we are completely cut off from a large part of ourselves.

There are a few pictures, but no index.  I could not find the name of Aldrich Ames anywhere in this book, but if the book had been written a few years ago, I feel sure that Rosario Ames and Vitaly S. Yurchenko could have been pictured as great friends, equally disenchanted by CIA activities, with Rosario fulfilling his need for some female companionship.  And Aldrich Ames and Vitaly Yurchenko could have framed Ronald Pelton (\\"convicted of espionage on June 5, 1986.\\"  p. 210) and Edward Lee Howard (\\"granted political asylum by the Soviet Union on August 7, 1986.\\" p. 210) for providing the KGB with information that the KGB had been receiving from Ames without knowing who was the mole.  This book is an older history, but those times were no less complicated.  A case officer is not usually pictured as being so jumpy that an American author would attempt to describe his state of mind like this:<br />\\"But he was aware of something else that had happened that the CIA did have control over--a violation of Yurchenko's rights that was so unthinkable, so shocking, so outrageous, that it must rank as one of the major scandals in the history of the CIA.\\"  (p. 7).  This book does not say that it must be something he heard on TV while he was trying to sleep.<br />Up to that point in the book, the most shocking reports were that Yurchenko had spent ninety-three days with the CIA (p. 3), \\"there had been 125 newspaper and wire service stories reporting Yurchenko's defection.\\"  (p. 6)  And a \\"new story detailed some of the damaging information he had divulged to the CIA.\\"  (p. 7).  What made his case more like Yuri I. Nosenko's (mentioned on pp. 13, 19, 63-64, 92-93, and 136) was that the CIA kept assigning guards who did not want to let him out of their sight, and had a TV on all night while Yurchenko was trying to sleep.  (pp. 122-125).  Feeling that security was as concerned about keeping him from escaping as it was about protecting him seemed to make staying in America a dubious solution to whatever problem he was trying to avoid.<br />The most American part of the book starts on page 9 and resumes on pages 21-44, with reports of an FBI agent and Yurchenko in 1975 through 1980 going to fancy Washington restaurants for lunch and a string of drinks.  Officially, \\"They met to discuss threats against the embassy from demonstrators or nuts.\\"  (p. 9).  FBI agent \\"Joyce knew the KGB officer so well that when he heard he had defected, he accurately concluded that Yurchenko's mother must have died.\\"  (p. 10).<br />Another FBI agent thought his return to the Soviet Union could be blamed \\"largely on the CIA's coldness, the scandalous incidents that had happened, and the CIA's failure to keep his defection a secret.\\"  (p. 11).  In a press conference at the new Soviet embassy compound, Yurchenko explained that \\"the CIA had drugged him, kidnapped him, and then incarcerated him.\\"  (p. 16).  That isn't what Chapter 3 said happened in Rome on Thursday, August 1, 1985.\\"  (p. 45).  The problem is described as being at the head of the agency.<br />\\"Casey lived by coups, and he could not imagine a greater success than being able to debrief one of the other side's top spies.  Over the coming months, the seventy-two-year-old DCI would play it for all it was worth.  In the race to glory, Yurchenko's only condition to defecting--that there be no publicity--would be ignored.\\"  (p. 52).<br />For debriefing Yurchenko, the FBI picked the son of a Chicago policeman who attended Catholic schools and Southeastern Illinois Junior College, while the CIA picked a Yale graduate whose father was an editor for Life and Smithsonian Magazine, and his only brother was editor-in-chief of Reader's Digest from 1976 to 1984.  Earning about $54,000 a year, he thought that he ought to be able to convince the guards \\"making $21,804 a year\\" (p. 64) not to act like they were \\"holding Yurchenko captive.\\"  (p. 64).  But perhaps more shocking, \\"Beyond his bellyaching, Thompson thought that Yurchenko had a morbid sense of humor.\\"  (p. 66).  Sometimes this is difficult to distinguish from great spy-craft.  \\"Typically, the film was concealed in fake rocks or dog droppings containing secret compartments ingeniously fashioned by the CIA's Office of Technical Services.\\"  (p. 70).  The KGB had its own tricks, including \\"umbrellas that shoot poison pellets.\\"  (p. 74).<br />Chapter 5 starts with a furniture buying expedition to fill a house.  There are insights into the character of the people involved in spying, and \\"Somehow, Yurchenko managed to convey to him that $1 million would be an appropriate figure.\\"  (p. 101).  In addition to the furniture and a salary, of course, but he never figured out where he wanted the CIA to deposit his money.  Chapter 6, about events in Montreal, timed \\"to make sure that when Yurchenko wanted to see her, Alexander--now the Soviet consul general in Montreal--would not be around\\" (p. 105), has the most action.  After many pages in which newspapers are hardly mentioned, on September 26, 1985, suddenly the Montreal Gazette had a page one story on the same day \\"Hurricane Gloria was moving up the East Coast.\\"  (p. 114).  Then in October, Yurchenko had a poached salmon dinner with Casey in the director's dining room at the agency.  (p. 120).<br />Chapter 7, has information (based on nothing but a rumor) about a trip of Nicholas Shadrin to Vienna on pages 134-140 which ended him due to too much chloroform.  Chapter 8 starts with the 705-word story on Shadrin in the Washington Post, October 30, 1985.  (p. 141).

US	41560427	R1S4BFZM89ZLG6	0836925351	457070413	Economic Basis of Politics (Essay index reprint series)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	A small book for big thinkers	This book was originally four lectures delivered by Charles A. Beard at Amherst College in 1916.  The fourth lecture was revised when the book originally appeared in 1922, to try to keep up with events.  If anything, the relationship between economic interests and the ability of governments to reflect the general will of the governed suffered an agonizing setback after World War One, when constitutions which provided universal suffrage, soon to include women in many countries, were abrogated by fascist forms of totalitarian political control leading up to World War Two.  In 1945 a long chapter was added to attempt to relate events to that point to our understanding of the political possibilities which still remain open to those who might support some new constitutions.<br />Economics used to be much more stable than governments, and the early philosophers who had opinions on the role of the governed in systems of government assumed that the components of the system would represent various economic interests.  Aristotle gets credit as ` \\"the father of political science\\" because he took it out of the sphere of utopian idealism where Plato left it and placed it on the strong foundation of natural history.'  (pp. 4-5).  For an ideal society, even then, \\"A city ought to be composed, as far as possible, of equals and similars; and these are generally the middle classes.\\"  (p. 20).  A father of the United States Constitution, James Madison, wrote in Number Ten of the Federalist, on `the protection of the different and unequal faculties of men for acquiring property.  \\"From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results.\\" ' (pp. 16-17).<br />There is a lot to be said for systems which can combine representatives of different interests and produce results which would be considered satisfactory to a majority.  The form of political theory tending to demand this result most strongly is Rousseau's SOCIAL CONTRACT, which proposed giving a majority the power to impose \\"the general will.\\"  (p. 51).  The French Revolution is considered an example of the inability of a vast number of people with no economic interests to run a society.<br />\\"Then followed the Revolution of violence and terror in which radical readers inflamed the disenfranchised by appeals to the gospel of Rousseau and to the proclamations of the bourgeois.  To save themselves the latter had to resort to that other great source of authority, the sword.  This instrument was wielded by Napoleon Bonaparte, a man who understood the relation of property to political power, and who, through his constitutions based on checks and balances, gave stability to bourgeois institutions.\\"  (p. 55).  We still have some terror and proclamations of the bourgeois, but there seems to be little evidence than anyone is about to write a constitution with the checks and balances that can defeat the gospel that inspires those who are no longer fired up with zeal by the doctrines of Rousseau.<br />The United States was in a *nice country, if you can get it* category at the time of the American Revolution, with fundamental equality through land ownership available to those who were not involved in productive activities or being enslaved.  Jefferson's choice of \\"the free-and-equal doctrine\\" (p. 58) was easier to proclaim in America because \\"There was no established clergy here.  There was no titled aristocracy.\\"  (p. 57).  Those who pictured themselves governing themselves in America had no reason to worry that \\"Jefferson, while justifying the revolt against George III, in fact challenged the rule of property which was guaranteed by the state constitutions drafted by his fellow revolutionists in that very epoch.\\"  (pp. 57-58).<br />This book is small, but there is some question if the simplicity with which it begins can lead to any enlightenment in the face of the complexity which we face.  Chapter IV,The Contradiction and the Outcome (pp. 62-70), only leads to \\"In other words, there is no rest for mankind, no final solution of eternal contradictions.\\"  That idea comes from 1922, shortly before \\"No less drastic than its consequences has been a transformation in the functions of government, particularly in those which call for wholesale intervention in economic operations.\\"  (p. 71).  Looking back in the spring of 1945 might have been more comforting than facing the end of 2003 with economic sanctions still in force against some political regimes which displease the global superpower more than any form of economic activity or illegal substance ever will.  But the gross distortions of political economics in this book hardly extends beyond the restrictions which communism imposed on itself.<br />The first page of Chapter V, Economics and Politics in Our Revolutionary Age, mentions Lenin and Trotsky, \\"the early leaders of the Russian revolution.\\"  (p. 71).  The problem they faced, representing a party which predated the vanguard of the economic system they intended to run, seems similar to the United States trying to establish a constitution for Iraq, a country in which people have interests which are not economic, the lack of security there now extending beyond the concern for property rights.  Beard was even fearful.  \\"But military men have, necessarily, a set of values which differ in many respects from civilian values; and the military interests, enlarged by universal conscription, will constitute a powerful influence in American affairs, with all that may involve amid the domestic and foreign contingencies of coming ages.\\"  (pp. 102-103).  It is not likely that Beard was then worried about how long it might be before Iraqis act like civilians.  Some might be wondering how long it will be before electricity will even allow economic activity.The Contradiction and the Outcome (pp. 62-70), only leads to \\"In other words, there is no rest for mankind, no final solution of eternal contradictions.\\"  That idea comes from 1922, shortly before \\"No less drastic than its consequences has been a transformation in the functions of government, particularly in those which call for wholesale intervention in economic operations.\\"  (p. 71).

I am hardly a practitioner of any of the forms of meditation mentioned in this book, but it is quite convincing that many aspects of the Hindu religious experience have found an important place in the modern world.  The index is small but useful.  It can be found after the picture of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi with Paul, George, and John of the Beatles on page 125.  Designed by an educational publisher in London, it was printed in China and manufactured in Singapore with colorful pictures on slick paper, with pages that are smaller than a typical magazine.  The print often appears on portions of a picture that is in a single color, as on page 45, which has a caption:  &quot;BACKGROUND Shiva is an ascetic, the only one of the godhead who is forever in deep meditation.&quot;  The head, with a jewel in the position of the third eye, is above the printed text for that page, but only an arm and naval can be discerned clearly in the area where his body is obscured by the text.  On page 15, by fading out where his leg runs into the text, the knee of a Brahmin at a lakeside in Pushkar seems to disappear.<br />Though the Introduction starts on page 6 with a tiny Chapter 1 designation, there seems to be a new title each time the page is turned.  The Quest for Inner Peace (p. 8), The Indus Valley Civilization (p. 10), etc.  Holy Writings are described in Chapter 2 with some emphasis on how ancient the sacred hymns were.  The Upanishads are called a &quot;slim collection of Sanskrit verses . . . called the Vedanta, meaning `End of the Vedas.'&quot;  (p. 25).  This page introduces maya, Brahman, atman, karma, and samsara, with simple explanations.<br />Continued interest in The Mahabharata Epic is indicated by a picture of an Indian television costume drama on page 32.  &quot;Like Shakespeare, the Mahabharata is a linguistic storehouse that has been raided by writers and poets.  Its plotlines were retold for centuries by traveling storytellers and puppeteers, and now feature in countless television dramas and Bollywood epics.&quot;  (p. 33).<br />On the next page, the Bhagavad Gita explains the form of enlightenment offered by Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu.  Later Krishna is shown as a baby on page 50.  In Avatars on page 56, Buddha is mentioned as the ninth appearance of Vishnu, before &quot;Kalki, the avatar yet to come.&quot;  In the first appearance, &quot;As the Fish, Vishnu warned Manu (the equivalent of Noah in Judeo-Christian tradition) that a universal flood was coming, and pulled the boat he built to safety.&quot;  (pp. 56-57).<br />The transition from philosophy to practice begins with Subtle Energy on page 70, locating seven chakras &quot;at the points in the astral body where the nadis meet.&quot;  Basic information is provided about Yoga in the classical form of practicing meditation, and the variations:  Hatha Yoga (p. 76), Laya Yoga (p. 78), Mantra Yoga (p. 80), Tantric Yoga (p. 82), Jnana Yoga (p. 84), Karma Yoga (p. 86), Bhakti Yoga (p. 88), and Kundalini Yoga (p. 90).  Those who are familiar with a few positions might wish to study the other possibilities and the dangers that this book says are involved in advanced forms before going further.<br />Chapter 5, on Hindu Society, provides a picture of religious life in India today.  Chapter 6, Hinduism in the World, tries to account for the spread of the Hare Krishna movement, founded in the United States in 1966 (p. 120), and the related religions, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism.

US	41560427	R3BMK9L1QZ5J51	0674010248	109277338	Coming of Age as a Poet: Milton, Keats, Eliot, Plath	Books	5	13	20	N	N	Poems worth knowing, and why	This book might deserve a wider audience than it will receive, though it seems unlikely that readers of this book will find themselves better prepared to avoid any great catastrophe.  I find myself looking for great themes that would make knowledge as a progression from century to century worth sustaining, but the themes of the poems in this book are only a small part of the analysis the poems are subjected to.  I still do not know enough about poetry to find this book easy to read.  At a lecture, I might absorb the points that are most obvious, but I like being able to refer to the main poems in print, reading slowly enough to actually be learning these poems, along with enough lines of other poetry in the text to serve as examples showing some kind of progress.  It takes awhile to allow familiarity to develop gradually from an examination of the poems in conjunction with the comments of Helen Vendler about the level of mastery shown by the creators of these poems.<br />These lectures are highly informative for people who have some interest in poetry, but who have not mastered technical aspects of rhyme and verse that are particularly important in the analysis of the sonnets of Keats.  Pages 68-70 show types of sonnets written by Keats, with dates of individual sonnets provided on pages 71-79.  Helen Vendler shows an interest in phonic similarities like rhymes, taking ten lines on page 111 to line up words in the &quot;reduplicative semiosis of the close&quot; which starts eight lines from the end of &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; by T. S. Eliot to show multiple parallels of words associated with the mermaids singing.  I am far more interested in themes than in methods of the poets, and the final chapter on Sylvia Plath is of interest to me primarily because the selected poem, &quot;The Colossus,&quot; contains the line, &quot;It's worse than a barnyard.&quot;  (p. 124).<br />I find Milton difficult but important.  Criticism of Milton is such a large field that the choice of a poem by Milton seems to be the obvious way to start a book like COMING OF AGE AS A POET.  The poem selected as Milton's first masterpiece, &quot;L'Allegro,&quot; is not as well known or well written about as some others, and I would like to offer a theological reflection on our position in time very similar to Milton's line, &quot;This must not yet be so,&quot; (p. 15) from the Nativity Ode, &quot;On the Morning of Christ's Nativity.&quot;  Vendler prefers &quot;the effortless ease of `L'Allegro.'  The Nativity Ode aims at more, but strains at its ambitions.  In it, Milton covers all of recorded time, . . .&quot;  (p. 13).  &quot;This must not yet be so,&quot; is a line that limits &quot;those ychain'd in sleep&quot; to keep waiting for &quot;The wakefull trump of doom&quot;  (p. 15) to signal their salvation.  I would not know nearly as much about that poem if I had not read Vendler's explanation.  &quot;The time-scheme of these ten lines (the last two of stanza XV and the eight lines of XVI) takes on the following journey:&quot;  (p. 15).  Failure to understand what Milton is about seems to be the norm, but Milton also might have had a feeling that catastrophe could easily be described, but that catastrophe always ought to be kept waiting for some more modern poet to contemplate.<br />There is a great line within the 152 lines of &quot;L'Allegro&quot;:<br />&quot;The melting voice through mazes running;&quot; (p. 22).<br />That is eleven lines from the end of the poem, describing the music available in cities, where, in the final line:<br />&quot;Mirth with thee, I mean to live.&quot;  (p. 22).<br />The poem is addressed to Mirth, which Vendler finds superior to, but in conflict with the kind of &quot;contemplative pleasure in `Il Penseroso,' the Christian context immediately troubles the values earlier examined in `L'Allegro,' so much so that one can't simply view these poems as presenting the same person alternately and equably participating in mirth one day and contemplation the next.&quot;  (p. 25).<br />Such a controlling idea of self is fundamental to the type of voice which Vendler pictures great poets achieving in their mature work.  As much as we may disagree about the fixed nature of any form of maturity, I was glad to see the following evidence that she had noticed my favorite line:<br />&quot;The Renaissance protagonist, with characteristic Miltonic competitiveness, will outdo Orpheus, since `the melting voice through mazes running' will produce such `streins as would have won the ear / Of Pluto, to have quite set free / His half-regain'd Eurydice.'&quot;  (pp. 25-26).<br />&quot;The intrinsic qualities of high art are evoked, one by one, as Milton emphasizes, with respect to music, its emotionality by the verb `pierce'; its sweetness by the participial adjective `melting'; its complexity in the image of `mazes'; its power in the strength of the participial phrase `untwisting all the chains' and its headiness by the unexpected oxymorons in the `wanton' nature of its `heed' and the `giddy' nature of its `cunning.'&quot;  (p. 35).<br />&quot;Needless to say, the m's and n's of this exquisitely `melting' passage are intuitive if not deliberate.&quot;  (p. 35).<br />Ten lines of the poem, in which &quot;The melting voice through mazes running&quot; is line eight, are printed as an example of &quot;the superbly unfolding hypotactic syntax that closes the poem:&quot; (p. 38), followed by an attempt to explain the poem by spacing the words differently,<br />&quot;If we graph this sentence, we can see its enchained nature:<br />With wanton heed,<br />and<br />giddy cunning, The melting voice<br />through mazes running,<br />Untwisting all the chains<br />that ty the soul.&quot;  (p. 38).<br />&quot;Milton has learned to slip from one compartment of his mind to another without strain, and with temperate pleasure--until he capitulates to a final intensity, the ecstatic feeling that arises when verse and music are combined.&quot;  (p. 39).icipating in mirth one day and contemplation the next.&quot;  (p. 25).<br />Such a controlling idea of self is fundamental to the type of voice which Vendler pictures great poets achieving in their mature work.

But this book is about a theological sense, in which the grace of God makes justification a gift to sinners.  The argument is old, springing from the author's examination of the concept of justification in CHURCH DOGMATICS by Karl Barth, a multi-volume work published in English in the years 1936-62, according to the Bibliography (p. 304), from original German volumes dated 1932 to 1955.  (p. 303).  The American edition of JUSTIFICATION by Hans Kung has a Preface dated August, 1964.  Barth is accused of petrifying the teachings of the Catholic Church (p. 103) because he picks an argument with the Council of Trent that condemned Martin Luther as heretical on this issue.  Adolf von Harnack, in a book published in 1910, wrote of the decree which was issued on January 13, 1547, &quot;Although it is a work of artifice, the decree on justification is in many respects admirably worked out.&quot;  (p. 105).<br />A number of languages show up in this book.  Titles in the Bibliography tend to be in German, Latin, or French.  Discussions of scripture sometimes include the Greek and Hebrew terms which appeared in the earliest versions.  Using the list of Greek words in the back of YOUNG'S ANALYTICAL CONCORDANCE TO THE BIBLE, I was able to find that the Greek words associated with Catholic in this book approximate a Greek word in Acts 4:18.<br />&quot;In fact, Catholic teaching is too Catholic (kappa alpha theta' omicron lambda omicron nu) to be readily spotted in any one place, for it still lays claim to all truth.&quot;  (p. 111).<br />If the last letter had been upsilon, which looks much like nu, the word would be the same as AT ALL used in the decree in Jerusalem against the teaching of Peter and John in Acts 4: 18:  &quot;So they called them and commanded them not to speak AT ALL nor teach in the name of Jesus.&quot;<br />The author of this book is a priest who is a German theologian, but in 1980 the Vatican declared that he could no longer be considered a Catholic theologian.  The history of this kind of conflict, from the time of the Reformation, is the main topic of JUSTIFICATION:  THE DOCTRINE OF KARL BARTH AND A CATHOLIC REFLECTION.  The English translation includes a letter from Karl Barth dated 31 January, 1957, acknowledging how well this book accords with his own views.  Anyone who has a solid foundation in religious thinking ought to be able to appreciate the situation of the author, who is free to embrace as much thought as his mind can hold, only to be warned in 1980 that such thinking does not reflect Catholic theology simply because it appeals to him.  What does he know?  Part Two of this book is called:  An Attempt at a Catholic Response.  Considering Holy Scripture as the principle source of Catholic theology in Chapter 20, Christocentricity in Chapter 21, Creation in Chapter 22, forbearance and grace in Chapter 23, the incapacity of every form of self-justification in Chapter 24, Grace as Graciousness in Chapter 27, and embracing Essential change in Chapter 31, it is not difficult to see how the Vatican might question which side the author was on.  This translation was published in 1964, long before the Vatican made its declaration in 1980 that its author was not totally committed to church doctrine.<br />I consider this book highly scholarly.  It is prone to lose those who are not familiar with each element of its argument.  There are only 17 entries in the list of Abbreviations on page xvii, before the main explanation, &quot;Karl Barth's CHURCH DOGMATICS is cited with volume and page numbers thus:  IV/1, 355.&quot;  That does not explain what LXX means in Chapter 28, The Declaration of the Sinner's Justice.  Possibly it covers a ten-year period, 70-79 A.D. or even 61-70 A.D., in which Paul was writing Romans 3.20, obviously the subject of the following comment:  &quot;It is significant, as Zorell says, that [delta iota kappa alpha iota omicron upsilon nu] in the LXX generally means forensic justification.  On this cf. the Pauline citation in Rom. 3.20 with Ps. 143.2.&quot;  (p. 209).  If that does not ring any bells for you, consider the following comment, in a list of &quot;some hints as to what can be said in favor of the forensic meaning of the word DIKAIOUN, especially in Pauline usage: . . . (3)  The forensic character of the LXX citations in Paul (cf. Zorell).&quot;  (p. 210).<br />Zorell does not appear in the index, but the Bibliography for Part C. of this book reveals that F. Zorell published a LEXICON GRAECUM NOVI TESTAMENTI GRAECI in Paris in 1931.  There is also an entry in the Bibliography for Part D, &quot;Zorell, F.  See under C.&quot;  (p. 321).  Most people seem to have so much justification nowadays that we don't argue about the finer points of this doctrine, but you might read this book so that thereafter you can be amazed by how many people seem to assume this kind of thing willy nilly.<br />The argument in this book is not overly philosophical.  It sticks to theology.  There isn't even an entry in the index for Kant, but Hegel is mentioned on four pages.  As you might know, &quot;Barth has assimilated, especially through the theology of Schleiermacher, the whole development from Kant through Fichte and Schelling to Hegel.  He has also drawn upon later Protestant theology, particularly that of Overbeck, Feuerbach, Strauss, and especially the theological existentialism of his own teacher, Herrmann.&quot;  (p. 3).

I have fond memories of being in the presence of three of the authors mentioned in this book, usually for readings from a book that I had not read.  Just knowing that such people exist is part of the omniscience of our journalistic age, but I have read books by more than a dozen, most of which were pretty funny.  Comedy skits are becoming a fundamental part of the way in which many people develop an understanding of the world.  At the cutting edge, the raw material which the world provides is more mysterious than the nature of jokes.  Entertainment values can skewer select lives in ways that are most amusing when the punishment is self-inflicted, and education can become an effort to addict people to reading with this kind of expectation.  My life is as prone to this addiction as any, with several movies adding to the knowledge that I have of a few more creative efforts.  Comedy is a habit that has become widely admired as the nature of reality has become so skewed that a major reason everybody is not equal has to be because we know different jokes.  Parody is a pretense which allows J. B. Miller to make obvious how difficult any effort to produce a meaningful reflection of our times became in a century which followed the great minds, Freud and Jung, joking about polymorphous perversity.<br />You ought to be curious about what is in this book, if you have any appreciation for how funny people's thinking has been lately, but you can't depend on anything that it says because the disclaimer on the page before the Contents says:  &quot;Don't believe a word of it.&quot;  With 44 selections in the 235 numbered pages, at an average of 5 pages per author sampled, selected, folded. spindled, or mutilated, which were preceded by a ten-page introduction dated May 2002, in which the satirist claims he was nine when he pocketed pages from Virginia Wolff's journal dated 1936, which could mean J. B. Miller was born before 1928, and might have been 74 when he produced these reflections on &quot;these ink-stained wretches&quot; (p. xi) who supposedly &quot;entrusted these pieces to me on the understanding that I would never share them with anyone.  So here they are.&quot;  (p. xii).<br />Was rock funny?  In the &quot;Rabbit Rocks&quot; by John Updike, Harry Angstrom is in a man band, leaping and tripping on a speaker cable, falling off the stage for a compound fracture of his right leg.  Janice tells him, &quot;You're a joke.  They're calling it Lame Rock.&quot;  (p. 100).  Then in the List of Works by Joyce Carol Oates, there's &quot;I'm a Believer:  Musings on the Monkees.&quot;  (p. 112).  That's more like a reminder than a joke, coming after &quot;Whodathunkit (I did)&quot; (p. 111).<br />People don't always plan to get old, but &quot;Harry Potter and the Rolling Stone&quot; by J. K. Rowling describes Keith as something worse:  &quot;The heap coughed and then closed its eyes.  Harry assumed it had gone back to sleep.&quot;  (p. 223).  The theme is how quickly things get old in this culture.  &quot;Even Harry was getting a little long in the tooth for the kids these days; every six months they were on to a new action figure or boy band.  He was thinking of retiring himself--after all, who wanted a nineteen-year-old boy wizard?&quot;  (p. 225).<br />There is something great about freedom:  a culture which allows so much to be going on that none of it fits together.  The ideal moment in the book, THE SATANIC NURSES, for me, was in a set of rules by Norman Mailer on meeting women, designed to avoid the problems he had, and learning from his mistakes.  Try to picture the dating scene from Norman Mailer's point of view:  &quot;How was I to know?  I had two tickets to the Timothy McVeigh Lethal Injection, which the press had made out to seem like the hottest event in town.&quot;  (p. 32).  This did not turn out to be a great date for Norman Mailer, however much it reminds me of the old-fashioned procedure by which someone might be pictured dancing upon the air in the great poem by Oscar Wilde, &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol.&quot;  The wit in this book is like the wry verse from this poem by Wilde:<br />It is sweet to dance to violins<br />When Love and Life are fair :<br />To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes<br />Is delicate and rare :<br />But it is not sweet with nimble feet<br />To dance upon the air !<br />The J. R. R. Tolkien parody, &quot;Lord of the Strings,&quot; has a brilliant idea about string which was magic, so when a string was tied around Balbot Biggins' finger, &quot;he found that he was able to remember things.&quot;  (p. 38).  Evil Knitting Needles and The Return of the Yarn finally result in a &quot;(Big battle with string.)&quot;  (p. 39).<br />The song parody in this book, &quot;penned by an evidently irate Cole Porter,&quot; (p. 40), reversed the idea of the famous song, &quot;You're the Top.&quot;  Typical ideas:<br />&quot;You're a fiend<br />I'd say more but it'd be obscene.&quot;  (p. 41).<br />That idea might be quite common, now, as everything becomes more uninhibited.  The wit is in being able to say things that take some thinking to figure out what it sounds like, not just how it looks.  &quot;You're an ist that's Fash&quot;  (p. 41).  In the song, it might be twisted around like that so it would rhyme with &quot;You're the stock market crash,&quot; but I suspect there is a deeper meaning.  Normally, it would not be polite to say some of the things in this song, or this book.  I shouldn't even tell you what line rhymes with &quot;A stupid joker.&quot;  (p. 42).d not turn out to be a great date for Norman Mailer, however much it reminds me of the old-fashioned procedure by which someone might be pictured dancing upon the air in the great poem by Oscar Wilde, &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol.&quot;  The wit in this book is like the wry verse from this poem by Wilde:<br />It is sweet to dance to violins<BR>When Love and Life are fair :<BR>To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes<BR>Is delicate and rare :<BR>But it is not sweet with nimble feet<BR>To dance upon the air !<br />The J.

US	41560427	R2XUWNCJ4Z2A68	0805069186	842224277	Courting Disaster: The Supreme Court and the Unmaking of American Law	Books	4	6	10	N	N	On famous judges mucking up the law	Martin Garbus is the kind of liberal, idealistic protector of constitutional rights who is not afraid to criticize the direction that the U.S. Supreme Court has been taking most recently.  One of the things which seems clearer to me than to Garbus is how the Chief Justice can use his power to select himself to write an opinion, whenever the Chief Justice votes with the majority, to fill the law with criticisms of itself that would seem to be empty remarks if filed in a dissent.  In the affirmative action cases, Garbus hardly knows what to call this.  \\"Brennan managed not only to pull together a winning coalition but also to have the chief justice on his side.\\"  (p. 234).  That was in the case of Fullilove V. Klutznick (1980), in which Chief Justice \\"Warren Burger, writing the majority opinion, said, `We reject the contention that in the remedial context the Congress must act in a wholly color blind manner.'\\"  (p. 234).  Actually, this book has `matter' instead of *manner* at the end of that sentence, but if the case had been about a matter in which Congress had acted totally color blind, it would not have been charged with reverse discrimination, a concept which this book calls \\"part of the Right's sleight of hand to disguise and obscure the varied purposes of racial preference programs.\\"  (p. 227).<br />Recently, in the 2003 decision on the undergraduate admission system at the University of Michigan, Chief Justice William Rehnquist was able to write an opinion for six justices, a majority who believe in affirmative action where necessary, but who found that giving minorities an extra 20 points on a scale of 0 to 150 was far too concrete as a form of preference, like having quotas for a certain number of minority students was improper in the case filed by Allen Bakke against the University of California Medical School at Davis, decided in 1978.  Compared to some states in which social class might seem determined by birth, what California and Michigan were attempting to do for minorities might seem advanced, in the way in which this book, with the subtitle, \\"The Supreme Court and the Unmaking of American Law,\\" clearly assumes that constantly harping on the legal principles which tend to benefit the overly ruling majority more than any other claimants can thwart such advancing policies.  The book's index is helpful for people who have particular questions about what is at stake in recent cases, though many abuses of constitutional rights that are no longer widely noted in the media are not mentioned.  There is no entry for *war*, *drug war*, *confiscations*, and the Private Property Rights Bill listed in the index, \\"passed by the House of Representatives in March 1995, called for compensation if government actions caused a property's worth to decline by 10 percent or more.  The proposal has not as yet been enacted into law, although a bill with those provisions is submitted each year.  But what Congress refuses to do through legislation, the Court may do through decisions.\\"  (p. 175).  With a major monetary crash on the horizon, many people are alarmed, but most are alarmed about different things, and it seems most likely that those who have been most successful at grabbing all the money now will do almost as well as those making a bundle on illegal substances in the future, if it resembles the past.  There is no entry in the index for cocaine, but it would be between:<br />Clinton, Bill<br />Women Against Violence Act of, 140<br />and<br />color blindness, defined, 227.<br />Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the decision in the Morrison case (May 2000) which held the WAVA unconstitutional because \\"Rape did not have sufficient economic effects to allow the federal government to step in.\\"  (p. 144).<br />This book is about trends.  Judges have power to make decisions in ways that most people could hardly consider without having their heads begin to spin, so the full title, COURTING DISASTER/ THE SUPREME COURT AND THE UNMAKING OF AMERICAN LAW, already says something as ominous about how the attempt to control the courts by appointing judges who serve only a narrow political spectrum, definitely including the innocence of those who are unborn, as specific observations like, \\"One more reactionary like Scalia or Thomas would assuredly end abortion and reverse even those few recent cases in which the minority bloc won.\\"  (p. 5).RICAN LAW, already says something as ominous about how the attempt to control the courts by appointing judges who serve only a narrow political spectrum, definitely including the innocence of those who are unborn, as specific observations like, \\"One more reactionary like Scalia or Thomas would assuredly end abortion and reverse even those few recent cases in which the minority bloc won.\\"  (p. 5).	2003-06-27

Is it so typical that philosophers are so high up in their ivory tower that their hypothetical situations lack any substance?<br />This book has no idea how often it is wrong about fundamental things like law; like how real people who have problems is not at all the same as how people have legal problems.  Americans should realize:  they live in a country where even their legal problems have legal problems, and people who want to count ballots better watch out that the Supreme Court does not get in their way.  Strange cases might involve something more unusual than \\"two persons arrested for stealing money.\\"  (p. 22).  If one of them is younger, it might be assumed that the other \\"is a hardened criminal, arrested and convicted many times for various offenses.  His stealing is a part of a pattern of behavior.\\"  (p. 20).  Judges might expect to consider that a young person hasn't had time to get caught as often, in imposing their sentences, but this book expects [wrongly, I'm sure] the jurors to be informed of everything the defendants ever did, and then argue about giving more punishment to whomever is worse.  \\"In the cases of the two thieves, we can imagine a debate among the jurors, some of whom might argue that, independent of the histories of the accused persons, equal crimes should be treated equally, and some of whom argue that background factors should be taken into consideration in dispensing justice.\\"  (p. 22).  If an attorney is effectively representing the thieves, all the extraneous information about a pattern of behavior will be excluded as prejudicial beyond the weight of its probative value, but this book, like most philosophy, would totally boggle everyone's mind if it tried to realistically describe how attorneys can complicate things.  Sentencing guidelines now take much of this out of the hands of judges, so any defendant who is not treated according to a standardized chart could become an obstacle to the judge advancing in federal courts, where confirmation hearings harp on odd behavior.  Pickering is not listed in the index, but the Democrats in the U.S. Senate are unlikely to confirm him for an Appeals court because of the case of Daniel Swan, who seemed to Pickering to be too young and drunk to serve six years for burning a cross in the yard of the interracial couple in his neighborhood.  Causing trouble in his neighborhood was something that even his neighbors didn't seem too concerned about, if you can guess which state he lived in.  Whole vast crowds of people have been burning crosses in movies that I have seen, set back in the days before television, when people got out and did things together, and everybody had some sense of what kind of consequences, like arson or bombing, was sure to follow.  Daniel Swan might have been released from prison in less than two years, sentenced for a lesser crime than whatever Timothy McVeigh was convicted of for an actual revolutionary bombing, but McVeigh was old enough to know better, as anyone who ever went to Waco, Texas to try to help David Koresh must be by now.<br />I'm far too extreme to read a whole book that considers anything which is perfectly clear an extreme.  \\"The extreme right-to-life position advances the following considerations in support of its position:  First, it argues that from the moment of conception, a human fetus is a human being, and that all human beings are persons.  Second, as mentioned above, it states that such persons are innocent of any crime.\\"  (p. 23).  The second step is necessary because we already know that people who have been born are part of a society that constantly kills, sometimes counting the dead, but considering the production of meat an agricultural item that is easier to replenish than 90 percent of the large fish in the ocean, now that we have almost saved the whales.  If there is anything people haven't killed, I am not sure if I have heard of it, though I know that in section 125 of THE GAY SCIENCE, Nietzsche wrote, \\" `Where is God?' he cried; `I'll tell you!  We have killed him -- you and I!  We are all his murderers. . . . Do we still smell nothing of the divine decomposition? -- Gods, too, decompose!  God is dead!  God remains dead!  And we have killed him!\\"  For real Christians, it is communion that makes this kind of thing a ritual participation in who we are, body and blood, and if killing millions is what we do, it seems likely to continue regardless of anything this book might say about protecting the innocent.w that we have almost saved the whales.

The total Vietcong in central Vietnam had grown from a thousand at the end of 1959 to five times that number by mid-1961.\\"  (p. 102).  President Kennedy had authorized an increase in American troops that jumped from hundreds to thousands as the years went by, but with little sign that, merely seven years after JFK took office, more than a thousand troops per week on each side might be losing their lives in Nam early in 1968.<br />As a professor in history with a year off from teaching, Howard Jones had the opportunity to examine documentary sources and the Oral History Interviews at presidential libraries, and he even talked to a few of the remaining participants.  Daniel Ellsberg is not a major character in this book, though Jones talked to him on March 27, 2002, concerning a meeting in which President Kennedy asked Lansdale about getting rid of The Nhus, \\"But if that didn't work out--or I changed my mind and decided to get rid of Diem--would you be able to go along with that?\\"  Lansdale ended up in a limousine with Robert McNamara after the meeting, where McNamara told him, \\"When he asks you to do something, you don't tell him you won't do it.\\"  (p. 365).  Actually, the source of this story is a book by A. J. Langguth, a New York Times correspondent in South Vietnam who claimed \\"Ellsberg's unpublished memoir, Langguth asserted, contained this account of Lansdale's clandestine meeting with the president.\\"  (p. 365).  \\"Ellsberg likewise considers the story valid.  But in an interview of McNamara conducted by Langguth years afterward, the former secretary alleged that he did not recall the meeting.\\"  (pp. 365-366).  I checked the index of SECRETS by Daniel Ellsberg, finally published in October, 2002, and found no mention of President Kennedy on the pages of the only entry for \\"Lansdale, Edward G.: McNamara's meeting with,\\" though it included a page on which \\"high Vietnamese officials who met with General Lansdale regarded him warily but with awe because of his reputation as a kingmaker.  They assumed he was there to pick the next Diem.\\"  By the time Ellsberg was on the Lansdale team, LBJ was president, Diem and Nhu were dead, and the Vietnamese could only hope that another government like Diem's would be better than a bunch of generals.<br />America clearly considered a coup against Diem at a time when it was trying to be as neutral as possible, because Diem could have asked American diplomats to leave Nam if he had any evidence that the Americans were actively engaging in plots against a government that it was supposed to be supporting.  The index is good at sorting out who was involved, though it isn't until page 280 that Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., a brigadier general in the Army Reserves who spent 1962 writing policy papers on Vietnam, was given the opportunity to become the American ambassador to Saigon.  In the photo section, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson's trip to Saigon on May 12, 1961, established that Frederick Nolting was ambassador then.  President Kennedy is shown talking with Henry Cabot Lodge on August 15, 1963, just a few weeks before JFK's CBS television broadcast with Walter Cronkite on September 2, 1963.  As usual, \\"Lodge's appointment, the Kennedy administration insisted, ensured bipartisan support for its Vietnam policy.  These statements were true, but they did not reflect reality.  The White House believed that Nolting had become too close to Diem,\\"  (p. 281).  The note supporting this information adds, \\"Nolting learned of his removal over radio while on vacation.\\"  (p. 501).<br />While this is a history of policy that led to the Vietnam war, there is little sense that any possibility, other than a result which might be considered a victory for American policy, was ever considered.  The only use that the Vietnamese had for the Americans was for creating the illusion that somehow America could win a war there.  By September 18, 1963, Lodge was trying to get Nhu to leave the country, and reporting back to Washington, \\"one feels sorry for him.  He is wound up as tight as a wire.  He appears to be a lost soul, a haunted man who is caught in a vicious circle.  The Furies are after him.\\"  (p. 371).<br />This is history on an emotional level.  I have no doubt that Jack Ruby pulled the trigger of the pistol that shot Lee Harvey Oswald in the stomach, resulting in Oswald's death, and it might have been because of a cancer that would take the life of Jack Ruby before the end of the 1960s, when we had learned enough from Lenny Bruce to let just about anybody swear, if they felt like it.  For President Kennedy to remain on good relations with the C.I.A., after news started coming in on how bad the situation in Nam really was, is like expecting Americans to believe that Ruby and Oswald were friends, or even knew each other.  Oswald and Ruby do not appear in this book.  For that side of the story, see OSWALD TALKED by La Fontaine.  This book has no news on who took part in the JFK assassination, which is officially still more of a mystery than anything that happened in Nam.formation adds, \\"Nolting learned of his removal over radio while on vacation.\\"  (p. 501).<br />While this is a history of policy that led to the Vietnam war, there is little sense that any possibility, other than a result which might be considered a victory for American policy, was ever considered.

US	41560427	R2RX65ODFLLHP1	0312181450	351369961	Nietzsche in Turin: An Intimate Biography	Books	4	6	16	N	N	Sometimes chatty, a very human effort	Subtitled \\"An Intimate Biography,\\" NIETZSCHE IN TURIN by Lesley Chamberlain might be considered a new age treatment of a life dominated by the urge to write, as exhibited by someone torn by his appreciation of the power of music to make things clearer in a far more artistic fashion, driven by a personal rivalry with Wagner that assumed more importance than his personal relationships, and suffering from a disease which would deprive him of his ability to behave.  Big philosophical issues are avoided as thoroughly as Nietzsche is pictured trying to avoid having contact with anyone who would want to discuss Hegel as he takes his daily walk in a city which \\"has a long reputation for magic and a disconcerting number of writers, from Tasso to Rousseau, J.M. Symonds to Primo Levi, have become depressed or gone mad there.\\"  (p. 211).  The final chapter, \\"Collapse into the Beyond,\\" is close to \\"The role syphilis played in heightening his pronouncements may be glimpsed through a comparison with his fellow sufferer, and ultimate madman, the French writer Guy de Maupassant.\\"  (p. 201).<br />I frequently wished that the book had an index.  There is some discussion of Nietzsche's appreciation of the artists of his time, but the names show up as substitutes for some picture, as when Nietzsche, in his autobiography, ECCE HOMO, mentioned the autumn of 1888 as like \\"a Claude Lorrain thought of into infinity, each day of equal, unbounded perfection.\\"  (p. 187).  This is so similar to a comment in his letters of October, 1888, about \\"the leaves on the trees are a glowing yellow, sky and great river a delicate blue, the air of supreme purity - a Claude Lorrain in a way I had never dreamed of seeing him\\" (p. 167), with a note that only specifies \\"18.10.88, 19.10.88, 30.10.88\\" (p. 244), that I wonder if searching the web might give me more information about this artist, and more quickly than looking through the rest of this book.<br />NIETZSCHE IN TURIN ends with a Bibliography, pp. 253-256, which provides the sources for much of the information in the book and its notes.  An American professor has written a biography called YOUNG NIETZSCHE, but NIETZSCHE IN TURIN cites a book from 1912, THE YOUNG NIETZSCHE by Elisabeth Foerster-Nietzsche, which must have at least 330 pages, as the more recent book does not.  Page 330 recorded that \\"Fritz knew only too well how characteristic it was of all three of us in the first flush of our indignation to say and write sharp and unpleasant things which a day or two later we scarcely remembered having thought or written.\\"  (p. 239, Chapter 8, note 18).  THE SCIENCE OF JOY is also used as the title of a book by Nietzsche known by other translations into English, and THE SCIENCE OF JOY makes so much sense in a new wave understanding of the world that it might lead readers to the conclusion that all of Nietzsche could be understood best in that way.<br />Nietzsche originally moved to Turin in April, 1888, but this book provides a comparative chronology for philosophical breakthroughs from 1819 to 1930, when Sigmund Freud wrote CIVILISATION AND ITS DISCONTENTS.  A far better translation of Freud's title is given somewhere in the text, but not in the Bibliography, and Freud appears offhandedly in the notes often enough that even an index might not clarify how much this book depends on how Freud is affecting new wave thinking recently.  Names of people that Nietzsche wrote to in 1888 often appear without any explanation of who they were, and events in 1882 involving Lou frequently appear as explanations for the major forces driving Nietzsche's thoughts as he attempted to turn himself into the culmination of all history, drama, and the ultimate music critic.  Even closer to perfection, Nietzsche is described as \\"delighted in 1888 when Carl Fuchs, well placed in Danzig to know Polish, told him that the name Nietzsche could mean `man of nothing.' \\"  (p. 123).  Trying to be Polish, in the April '88 outline of his life thathe sent to Brandes, who had begun to lecture on Nietzsche's work, \\"gave him strength against the world which rejected him.\\"  (p. 123).<br />NIETZSCHE IN TURIN is so sympathetic that it is no surprise to find, \\"Here is the moral underside of life, in which the good are destroyed by their own goodness:  an excess of sympathy.\\"  (p. 105).  Self-reflection predominates so much that the author pictures herself writing in Turin in the autumn of 1994, hardly modernized by the 106 years which had passed since Nietzsche was putting himself into an autobiography with unusual glee.  The world could hardly appear more sane to Nietzsche now, though I think he could have found much better examples of music now, if he was willing to look beyond operas, musical comedy, and what anyone considers classical music.  Chamberlain seems more concerned about how \\"Psychotherapy has become incorporated into the Welfare State.  How Nietzsche, with his sensitivity to language, would have baulked even at that name, which might be translated back into German as *der Mitleidsstaat,* and given a Nietzschean reading as the state that killed God.\\"  (pp. 105-106).<br />I read this book looking for things that could remind me of \\"Harold and Maude,\\" a movie about age and youth in which the young man had an uncanny ability to fake death.  What was not even suggested by the plot in that movie was a comic ability to fake the death of God, an accomplishment that Nietzsche might be given credit for, if anyone could figure out precisely how that could be done.  This book did not apply itself to that problem, and most readers might not be surprised that such an attempt is missing, but something might still seem to be lacking.he sent to Brandes, who had begun to lecture on Nietzsche's work, \\"gave him strength against the world which rejected him.\\"  (p. 123).<br />NIETZSCHE IN TURIN is so sympathetic that it is no surprise to find, \\"Here is the moral underside of life, in which the good are destroyed by their own goodness:  an excess of sympathy.\\"  (p. 105).

Near the middle of the book is an essay, \\"The Originality of Machiavelli,\\" which shows how well Berlin could categorize intellectual activities into various kinds of significance.<br />\\"His distrust of unworldly attitudes, absolute principles divorced from empirical observation, is fanatically strong - almost romantic in its violence; the vision of the great prince playing upon human beings like an instrument intoxicates him.  He assumes that different societies must always be at war with each other, since they have differing purposes.  He sees history as an endless process of cut-throat competition, . . .\\" (p. 318).<br />The index is great, and even has an entry for \\"Pasternak, Boris Leonidovich . . . conversation with Stalin.\\"  Pasternak wanted to talk to Stalin, but the question which Stalin put to Pasternak, \\"whether he was present when a lampoon about himself, Stalin, was recited by Mandel'shtam\\" (p. 533) was not what Pasternak wanted to talk about.  Pasternak wanted to talk to Stalin \\"about ultimate issues, about life and death.\\"  (p. 534).  After Stalin put down the receiver, \\"Pasternak tried to ring back but, not surprisingly, failed to get through to the leader.\\"  (p. 534).  Stalin had been quick to decide where that conversation was going, and cut it short by observing, \\"If I were Mandel'shtam's friend, I should have known better how to defend him.\\"  (p. 534).  It is not obvious that Stalin would have appreciated a defense which asserted that the poem about Stalin was more true than anything else that Pasternak had ever seen, read, or heard, and any decent country would have comedians that would constantly broadcast such ideas on the radio 24/7 until the invention of TV would allow people to watch movies like \\"Forrest Gump\\" in the comfort of their own homes.  Stalin has been rightly condemned for being hopelessly authoritarian when judging humor that was aimed at his sorry self, and Isaiah Berlin sees the pattern as one that Russia was particularly prone to suffer indefinitely.  \\"Whatever the differences between the old and the new Russia, suspicion and persecution of writers and artists were common to both.\\"  (p. 537).<br />Berlin's account of his conversations with Anna Akhmatova strive to reflect what culture means for people who actively create work like Heine's comment, \\"I may not deserve to be remembered as a poet, but surely as a soldier in the battle for human freedom.\\"  (p. 537).  We are now such a comic society on a global level that pop mock rap on the internet can pick on the soldier's mentality in a hilarious way, but it is good to be able to read Isaiah Berlin to account for how much such humor matters.humor that was aimed at his sorry self, and Isaiah Berlin sees the pattern as one that Russia was particularly prone to suffer indefinitely.  \\"Whatever the differences between the old and the new Russia, suspicion and persecution of writers and artists were common to both.\\"  (p. 537).<br />Berlin's account of his conversations with Anna Akhmatova strive to reflect what culture means for people who actively create work like Heine's comment, \\"I may not deserve to be remembered as a poet, but surely as a soldier in the battle for human freedom.\\"  (p. 537).

I know that disinformation is a large part of any secret circus stunt, and everything that happens at a circus might be more convincing than any of the parts of the world that allegedly existed before and after the momentous events that are summarized on the back cover of this book as times when the C.I.A. \\"participated in the assassinations of . . . literally millions of ordinary people in Indonesia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Vietnam, East Timor and many other countries.\\" I've been in one of those countries on a U.S. government project that was not quite secret enough to suit some people, and it seemed like the C.I.A. was there long before I was, and even William Colby couldn't convince LBJ that hundreds of thousands of American troops shooting people there might get into the newspapers more often than he would like.  I like reading this book on places I have never been, like Germany, whose famous Hitler employed General Reinhard Gehlen as \\"Hitler's intelligence chief for the Eastern front\\" (p. 6) before he had the opportunity to help form the C.I.A. pursuant to a \\"secret treaty, his spy organization--which came to be called the Gehlen Org--would work for, and be funded by, the US until a new German government came to power.\\"  (p. 6).  I have searched for other information on the web about Reinhard Gehlen, which corresponds so well to the information in this book, that it is possible that the secret treaty also required Gehlen to teach the C.I.A. everything it knows.<br />Hit number 38: Crooked Banks, on BCCI, which had a London branch that was shut down by British bank examiners in 1991, managed loosely \\"Roughly $20 billion of BCCI's assets remain unaccouted for,\\" though \\"Before collapsing, BCCI managed to facilitate a host of CIA covert operations, notably George Bush's efforts to pump weapons to Saddam Hussein's Iraq (see Hit #40) and Edwin Wilson's `unauthorized' arming of Libya (see Hit #30).\\"  (p. 81).  Some people might still believe that BCCI was a Pakastani bank, and Mark Zepezauer seems to be dubiously relying on a rumor that it was the work of \\"Director Richard Helms in particular, actually started the bank, and that it `wasn't a Pakistani bank at all.'\\"  (pp. 80-81)rized' arming of Libya (see Hit #30).\\"  (p. 81).

Burke is remembered mainly as a conservative, old enough at the time of the French revolution to be appalled that anyone thought an attack which left the queen's bedchambers in Versailles full of mayhem and dead bodies could advance civilization.  The revolutionary freedom which America is currently attempting to bring to foreign portions of the world by demonstrating air superiority might be considered as deranged as the situations examined in this book, which was published in 1977, when hardly anyone had reason to suppose that the form of freedom offered by American military conquest was similar to the acts of Medea conjured by Edmund Burke into a description of the nature of rebellion in his REFLECTIONS ON THE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE, quoted in this book as an instance in which \\"Burke might well have sensed the relationship between his own radical streak and his enduring hatred towards his father.  Guiltily, however, he recoiled from the bloody horror and emphasized the loving and caring son.  The good subject, he insisted,<br />should approach to the faults of the State as to the wounds of a father, with pious awe and trembling solicitude.  By this wise prejudice we are taught to look with horror on those children of their country who are prompt rashly to hack that aged parent in pieces and put him into the kettle of magicians, in hopes that by their poisonous weeds and wild incantations they may regenerate the paternal constitution and renovate their father's life.\\"  (p. 64).<br />Other major figures mentioned in this book include Bedford, James Boswell, Charles James Fox, Warren Hastings, Tom Paine, Joseph Priestley, Rockingham, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Richard Shackleton, and Mary Wollstonecraft.  The beginning of the book emphasizes the role that religious dissenters in England played \\"in scientific and political innovation.\\"  (p. 13).  Joseph Priestly, \\"founder of the modern Unitarian movement,\\" (p. 13) opposed the \\"Poor Laws, which for the bourgeoisie were one of the most onerous of the old order's interferences with economic liberty.\\"  (p. 14).  In those exciting times, a mob \\"burned his laboratory and home in 1791, sending him to finish his days in dissenter's paradise--America.\\"  (p. 13).<br />Freud is mentioned well a few times in this book, showing that it is possible to take a modern view of times that were shaking the foundation of everything that was not America.

My favorite part of this book is the word *guitar*, which is closely associated with the name George Harrison in the George Harrison Discography on pages 212-231.  The Discography actually starts on page 207, with his solo albums in 1968, 1969, 1970, &quot;The Concert for Bangladesh (1971),&quot; 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1987,  &quot;Traveling Wilburys:  Volume One (1988),&quot; 1989, 1990, and &quot;George Harrison Live in Japan (1992).&quot;  There was no need to mention that he played guitar on those albums, or in the famous Beatles group before that, because almost everybody thought that mainly he was there to play guitar.  There were a few surprises for me after that:  &quot;James Taylor (1969)  George sang harmony on the song `Carolina on My Mind,' GOODBYE Cream (1969) George co-wrote and played guitar on the song `Badge.' &quot;  (p. 212).  Somehow I never noticed that on DONOVAN RISING (1973), &quot;George wrote a verse for the song `Hurdy Gurdy Man' that was not in the original version of the song.&quot;  (p. 220).<br />Most of the things that I remember from the book BEHIND SAD EYES were events in the personal life of George Harrison that I hadn't thought much about before.  The thing about George and Pattie, Pattie and Eric, with George thinking, &quot;I thought that was the best thing to do, for us to split, and we should have just done it much sooner.  But I didn't have any problem about it.&quot;  (p. 110).  In a society that tunes in mainly to the psychological needs of each individual, that kind of thinking is much easier for a writer to identify and portray than the kind of temper exhibited by Ringo after George started singing love songs for Maureen one night, when Ringo and Maureen invited George and Pattie to their home for dinner, and &quot;Pattie, totally mortified at this latest embarrassment, burst into tears and locked herself in Ringo's bathroom.&quot;  (p. 121).  There is no index, and the chapter titles are not much good at locating particular incidents that you might be interested in, but the book is a guide to how certain people see life, and the media have grown on a need to find this kind of information.at locating particular incidents that you might be interested in, but the book is a guide to how certain people see life, and the media have grown on a need to find this kind of information.	2003-05-05
US	41560427	R1IMUCWNPJOU36	0195070194	134748274	Aristocratic Liberalism: The Social and Political Thought of Jacob Burckhardt, John Stuart Mill, and Alexis de Tocqueville	Books	3	6	18	N	N	A history, really stuck in its time	This book is about the shape of intellectual perceptions in an era which was much more unsettled than the present, with preparation for a major war dominating the form of politics that were commonly perceived as getting along by going along.  The index, pp. 215-228, covers a range of topics, and is good on the correspondence and works of Burckhardt, Mill, and Tocqueville, the major writers on the political situation of their era that form the basis for this book.  The notes, pp. 167-206, are as expected for a book which began as a doctoral dissertation at the University of Chicago.  Note 5 on Chapter one admits, &quot;Burckhardt left hundreds of pages of lecture notes on the Revolution, but his own opinions are so enmeshed in unattributed quotations and paraphrases that determining from the notes which thoughts are his has proved impossible.&quot;  (p. 169).  Reading the text of ARISTOCRATIC LIBERALISM with an eye on the notes in the back soon leads to sources that are from multiple authors.  Note 33 is pretty clear that it is setting up a context.  `For a few of many references, see Burckhardt . . .  See also Mill, &quot;De Tocqueville on Democracy in America&quot; [II] (1840), CW, 18:167; Tocqueville, L'ANCIEN REGIME, OC, 2, pt. 1:47, 53;' etc.  (p. 170).  Note 34 cites both Tocqueville and Burckhardt in support of the statement, &quot;The result was its destruction and the encouragement of a passion for unity and uniformity, for the elimination of special privileges and of independent groupings within society.&quot;  (p. 16).<br />This book was published in 1992, long before 9/11/2001 became the dominant symbol of destruction that is such a contrast to the situation faced by Tocqueville, Mill, and Burckhardt due to &quot;the social and cultural leveling carried out by the Old Regime gradually weakened and even destroyed all the bonds that had formerly connected individuals in a society of orders.&quot;  (p. 16, citing note 33).  This situation was taken seriously, but associated with &quot;Individualism, in this negative sense, was intimately connected with political centralization.  The destruction of political liberty--that is, of a political system based on local self-government--was the worst result of the Old Regime in Tocqueville's eyes.&quot;  (p. 17).  Calling a belief in any established order ARISTOCRATIC LIBERALISM, as this book does over and over, is almost quaint.  Consider the choices faced by intellectuals of that time.  &quot;Too many of the ideas of the Revolution and the Enlightenment could easily lead to despotism, whether by a party or by a military dictatorship, for the aristocratic liberals to be comfortable.&quot;  (p. 33).  Perhaps we who regularly demonstrate and vote against such dictatorial tendencies have escaped the need to confront such fears, now that society is organized mainly for work and pleasure, so that now, the only form of order more important than entertainment values is the form of corporate hierarchy which people expect to submit to on the job.<br />Chapter 2 of ARISTOCRATIC LIBERALISM, with its emphasis on the hegemony of the middle class, the commercial spirit, stagnation, and mediocrity, comes close to a description of the current situation, though it doesn't consider how popular the link of home entertainment could make such modern adaptations as movies and sports, typically ersatz activities which create the illusion that localities have some grasp on the attention of the people living in a particular area.  On a national level, it is easier to believe that those carrying out policy are not quite following orders as much as they are following Donald Rumsfeld, an old man who could be replaced any minute, like the Secretary of the Army, who didn't have to give up his job because of anything he did at Enron.

US	41560427	R331614ERK6FVZ	0877229074	420319999	The Heidegger Case: On Philosophy and Politics	Books	4	2	5	N	N	A large topic, considered in small doses	These 18 selections, by 17 professors and one Research Director (in the Hegel Archives at the University of Bochum, Germany), while within the realm of thoughts \\"On Philosophy and Politics,\\" offer an education in Heidegger far broader than how his unique place in philosophy and support for the NSDAP (you should know who I really mean) are now topics subject to debate. I have read far more on Nietzsche than about Heidegger, and tend to be disappointed that the thought of Nietzsche looms like an already settled metaphysics of will to power in some of these selections, but the evaluation of either individual thinker seems to require an openness to how other philosophers are making their interpretations. Since this book was published in 1992, the overwhelmingly negative consensus about Heidegger's embrace of what is German, as an inner truth about some level of greatness in his esteem, has been the major objection to anything which he thought.<br />As a consideration of alternatives, philosophy offers thinkers the opportunity to discuss ideas in a manner which does not commit the speaker to an absolute commitment, one way or the other. I find this particularly true of the use which this book makes of the comments of Rudolf Bultmann, who was about five years older than Heidegger, studied and taught at Marburg, and who gets mentioned in this book more often than the listings in the index:<br />31, 106, 128, 317, 265; Heidegger's correspondence with, 15-16.<br />The correspondence had not been published when this book was written. The first page listed, 31, mentions a conversation between Bultmann and Heidegger after World War II, not a time when Heidegger was open to suggestions about what other people thought he ought to do. The source of this information was a biography of Martin Heidegger by Hugo Ott, published in 1988. This book, THE HEIDEGGER CASE, also contains an article by Hugo Ott, \\"Biographical Bases for Heidegger's `Mentality of Disunity,' \\" which starts with a description by Heidegger of an inquisition, \\"in December 1945, when I was brought before the faculty in the inquisition's cross-examination to answer the twenty-three questions and I broke down completely, Dean Beringer of the Medical School (who had seen through the whole charade and the intentions of the accusers) came to me and simply took me away . . .\\" (p. 93). Ott explains that \\"Martin Heidegger was in need of very intensive medical care\\" (p. 95), which I tend to see as politically motivated, but \\"the medical care came from Professor Beringer himself, who was then the director of the University Psychiatric Clinic: Heidegger was placed in the sanatorium Schloss Hausbaden . . . from February to the end of May 1946. After that time, the psychotherapeutic treatment continued with Gebsattel.\\" (p. 95). Even Archbishop Conrad Groeber was interested in his care, and sent a report to a priest in Rome. Ott is interested in the religious connection, even including a few lines in latin of famous Bible verses. \\"We should bear in mind the Twenty-third Psalm in discussing Heidegger.\\" (p. 96). But Heidegger found more salvation in Luther than in the system which he considered \\"the essence of Catholic faith.\\" (p. 106). Having seen the choice that Luther made, \\"After this, Heidegger came to be considered the Protestant who had come from Catholicism, . . . as Rudolf Bultmann wrote at the end of 1923 after participating in the St. Paul seminar that Heidegger offered following his call to Marburg.\\" (p. 106).<br />The following selection, \\"Heidegger, Nietzsche, and Politics\\" by Otto Poeggeler, includes a portion of the letter from Bultmann, dated December 23, 1923, about his seminar on the ethics of St. Paul. \\"This time the seminar is especially instructive for me, due to the participation of our new philosopher, Heidegger, a student of Husserl. He comes from Catholicism, but is entirely Protestant. . . . The older generation is unable to participate, as its members no longer evenunderstand the problem to which we are lending our efforts.\\" (p. 122). Though the title for this subsection is \\"Decline and Destruction,\\" the scientific advances of the century \\"which vastly lengthened the time of the origin of the universe,\\" (p. 122) seemed to bring philosophy to a new consideration of time.<br />As an example of reading philosophy, the tenth selection, \\"A Comment on Heidegger's Comment on Nietzsche's Alleged Comment on Hegel's Comment on the Power of Negativity\\" by Leszek Kolakowski, checks out a comment in \\"Der Siegel\\" just after Heidegger's death, in which \\"Heidegger asserted that whoever had ears to hear knew that he had criticized the Nazi regime in his Nietzsche lectures.\\" (p. 255). On the contrary, this selection is intended \\"to suggest, on one small point, that Heidegger employed his peculiar reading of Nietzsche to express--obliquely but clearly--his commitment to German imperialism.\\" (p. 255). At this point, people who have been hearing anything about the Committee on Social Thought, University of Chicago, might not be surprised that Leszek Kolakowski is listed in this book as a Professor there. The questions that are considered tend to be murky, even before Heidegger, and the philosophical attempt to come up with something positive, in spite of it all, ends with the conclusion that Heidegger \\"was not the only thinker whose work could have been employed for evil purposes without distortion, while at the same time it actually advanced in a seminal way the work of civilization.\\" (p. 262).understand the problem to which we are lending our efforts.\\" (p. 122).

Americans have come to think of war as an exceptional situation which is subject to being *over* at some point, and it is a rare professor who can convince them that war is so typical that even a religious system might consider The Bhagavadgita, or Gita for short, a sacred scripture in which Krishna urges Arjuna to fight because it is a surefire way to acquire knowledge.  \\"Therefore fight, O scion of Bharata!  Whoever thinks that this slays and that that is slain, lacks knowledge.  He is never born, nor does he die; nor having been once, does he cease to be.  He is unborn, eternal, changeless, primeval.  He is not slain when the body is slain.\\"  (p. 240).<br />People who consider this kind of experience somewhat mystical usually have gotten more of an education from reading newspapers and policy journals than in school.  Top policy experts who might expect religion to furnish little in their search for snappy intellectual comebacks which are decent enough to use in public, as well as those who crave world responsibility with an inflated sense of their own respectability, ought to see how these elements combine in this book.<br />RELIGIONS IN FOUR DIMENSIONS by Walter Kaufmann, published in 1976, with 250 photographs taken by the author, was the product of a life of pondering a world in which America seemed to hold so many of the answers, but the rest of the world, as could be observed in the pictures, had many more people.  As a professor of philosophy at Princeton University, Walter Kaufmann also had a background in American military intelligence during World War II, and a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1947.  This period, and the pattern of government psychological preparation of American citizens for world responsibilities, is part of the background information covered in HARVARD AND THE UNABOMBER by Alston Chase.  The effort to produce a general understanding of the situation is undercut by the research on the cutting edge of a sense of the concept, \\"the Dyad,\\" which is explained in HARVARD AND THE UNABOMBER as \\"in fact a personal concept,\\" (p. 243) that might be about as personal as what anyone would expect impeachment proceedings to be about, if another president is impeached like Bill Clinton was in 1999.<br />RELIGIONS IN FOUR DIMENSIONS does not claim to be about any secrets, but it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that secret weapons and deals have been one of the main factors in the triumph of anything which is successful on such a vast scale.  Comparing beliefs in particular doctrines is similar to evaluating the stability of various houses of cards.  While none is judged on how well it might hold water, Walter Kaufmann is particularly able to point out differences in the scriptures of the religions which claim a common source.<br />\\"According to tradition, the Prophet was illiterate, and the Biblical material in the Koran shows that he had not read the Bible nor had a Bible at hand.  His knowledge of the Bible was plainly second-hand and oral; he knew what Jews and Christians had told him, but not necessarily what was actually in the Scriptures and what was later Jewish or Christian lore.  Moreover, Jews and Christians have often charged that he also made simple mistakes and, for example, confused Miriam, the sister of Moses, with Mary, the mother of Jesus.  Muhammad, in turn, accused the Jews and Christians of having falsified their scriptures.\\"  (p. 164).<br />It is no wonder that tradition can accept illiteracy as furnishing a more substantial basis than the state of scripture as we have received it, tattered and possibly torn by competing efforts to translate and interpret unfamiliar languages, as none of these originally appeared in the standard English of Americans today.  Trying to find a real hero, Kaufmann attempts real comparisons.<br />\\". . . the contrast between Muhammad and Jesus is great, if not nearly so vast as that between Muhammad and the Buddha.  Among the great Christians, Muhammad may seem to resemble Calvin most of all because Calvin, too, was the ruler of a city and therefore confronted with practical concerns; both made much of the sublimity and sovereign power of God, who had predestined some for salvation and others for damnation, and both demanded submission to God's sovereign decree.  But Calvin was very much a northerner, icy rather than ardent, severe and ascetic, while Muhammad was in all of these respects his diametric opposite.\\" (p. 165).<br />For a really great comparison, Moses is the match for Muhammad.  \\"Both impressed upon their followers that they were not divine but merely messengers of God.  God was so great that by comparison they themselves were essentially like their fellow men, distinguished only by their mission to serve as God's mouthpiece.\\"  (p. 165).  But some distinctions were to last a long time.  \\"Truly, the sinners are immortal in the torment of hell.

US	41560427	R1XP3ERPZCET3V	0940262266	733074273	Hermes the Thief: The Evolution of a Myth	Books	5	5	12	N	N	This starts with wars fought for cows	I know more about the very beginning of this book than about the rest of it, but I consider it a fundamental approach to understanding the nature of war as it is understood in ancient cultural situations.  Hermes is one of the earliest figures that we might associate with such struggles, being described as an infant in comparison with his older brother Apollo, in early versions of a myth about Greek gods that forms a theme of this book.  There might have been a number of scholars who knew what the basic scheme of references cited in this book when it first appeared in 1947 were all about.  I assume that today, people may be vaguely aware of a few themes that the book inspires, but not much else.  When Homer wrote, cattle were assumed to be the reason for going to war:<br />\\"Cattle-raiding, as depicted in Homer, was a public enterprise, led by the kings and participated in by the whole people.  It is described as a war--a resort to force, and open force.  The institution appears to have been a common heritage of all the Indo-European peoples and to have had everywhere the same general characteristics.  To cite one illustrative detail:  the Sanskrit word for `war' means literally `desire for more cows.'  Coexistent with this institution of warlike plundering, or robbery, and terminologically distinguished from it in the Indo-European languages, was another type of appropriation, called theft.  Theft is appropriation by stealth; robbery is open and forcible appropriation.\\"  (pp. 5-6).<br />I do not have a \\"Homeric Hymn to Hermes\\" to see how well it departs from this distinction.  \\"Side by side with occasional terminology suitable to the raider appear terms suitable only to the thief.  The cattle-raid described in the `Hymn' is not the usual resort to open force, but a peculiarly stealthy operation.  There is no more incisive delineation of the contrast between the cunning trickster and the fighting hero than in the `Hymn,' where Hermes, a helpless infant relying only on his phenomenal cunning, challenges Apollo, the embodiment of physical power and the majesty of established authority.\\"  (pp. 7-8).<br />Much modern drama is based on traits ascribed to the god Hermes.  \\"That gift was not merely `stealthiness'; it was `stealthiness and skill at the oath.'  `Skill at the oath means guile or cunning in the use of the oath and derives from the primitive idea that an oath was binding only in its literal sense; a cunning person might legitimately manipulate it in order to deceive, as occurs often enough in Greek mythology.  In the `Homeric Hymn,' when Hermes uses just such an oath to deny that he has stolen Apollo's cattle, he is said to show `good skill.' \\"  (pp. 8-9).<br />I have a translation by Richmond Lattimore of works by Hesiod, which confirms that Hermes was responsible for giving Pandora \\"lies and deceitful words and a stealthy disposition.\\"  (p. 9).  As Lattimore renders the Greek myth, \\"but to Hermes, the guide, the slayer of Argos,/ he gave instructions/ to put in her the mind of a hussy,/ and a treacherous nature.\\"  Also:  \\"But into her heart Hermes, the guide, the slayer of Argos,/ put lies, and wheedling words of falsehood, and a treacherous nature,/ made her as Zeus of the deep thunder wished,/ and he, the gods' herald, put a voice inside her, and gave her the name of woman,/ Pandora, ...\\"  (HESIOD, pp. 25-27).<br />HERMES THE THIEF has an index which lists a lot of Greek names.  Appendix A didn't help me much.  Instead of providing an authoritative text for anything about Hermes, it engages in the kind of speculation that modern philologists use to decide who actually wrote the accounts that we now have.  Appendix B, \\"The Text of the `Homeric Hymn to Hermes,' \\" only provides the Greek Oxford text for lines 533 and 515 on p. 150, lines 414-417 on pp. 151-152, with an alternate reading on p. 153, lines 418-420 on p. 153, and lines 471-474 on p. 154.  Norman O. Brown's explanation of what these last lines mean is, \\"Hermessays he is willing to be to Apollo in the matter of the lyre what Zeus is to Apollo in the matter of prophecy--a typically impudent statement for Hermes to make.\\"  (p. 155).says he is willing to be to Apollo in the matter of the lyre what Zeus is to Apollo in the matter of prophecy--a typically impudent statement for Hermes to make.\\"  (p. 155).	2003-04-18

The songs in this book are dated from 1966 to 1976, though the book didn't appear until 1978.  Neil Young has a long history in music, and it has been easy for other performers to pick up and do songs that have been scored as this book has, with a separate treble staff for the vocal parts, and chord charts for guitar chords throughout.  A footnote at the beginning of \\"The Loner\\" explains how to make the guitar different, \\"Tune first and sixth strings to D (D A D G B D)\\" (p. 29) to play the chords in that song.  This is not the same as \\"Sugar Mountain,\\" \\"Tune all strings down one whole step to a D-based tuning.\\"  (p. 21).<br />I had an early video of his \\"Rust Never Sleeps\\" concert, in which Neil Young sat down by himself at a piano and played, note for note, the song \\"After the Gold Rush\\" as it appears on pages 54-57 of this book.  The last page is mainly devoted to singing the line, \\"Flying Mother Nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun\\" twice, after \\"All in a dream, all in a dream the loading had begun.\\"  I realized that it would take a lot of preparation to get that far, but the time which I devoted to reaching that destination was some of the most worthwhile musical efforts that I have ever attempted.<br />There are 35 songs in NEIL YOUNG ~ DECADE.  Fans of particular concerts, like WELD, might consider most of these songs very early in Neil Young's career.  The book is copyright 1978, Weld didn't come along until 1991, and only includes \\"Cinnamon Girl,\\" \\"Cortez the Killer,\\" \\"Like a Hurricane,\\" and \\"Tonight's the Night\\":  only four of the 35 songs in this book.  Fans of Buffalo Springfield might appreciate \\"Expecting To Fly,\\" and people who sing harmony might see if matching the notes in the book is easier than trying to pick parts off the recorded version.  The piano introduction for the song \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" has the kind of bass line that I find most interesting in the written music, jumping around slightly before it becomes the melody, and a vocal harmony is also provided.  This book helped me learn how much is going on in music besides the melody.  The complications for the song \\"Southern Man\\" take pages 58-61, while \\"Helpless\\" fits on pages 62-63 fine.  I have a tendency to like songs called \\"I Believe in You,\\" and the song on pages 64-66 asks the question like he is really worried about \\"Am I lying to you when I say that I believe in you?\\"  \\"Oh, oh\\" coincides with \\"la la la la\\" after that.<br />Then we get \\"Heart of Gold\\" on pages 71-73, \\"Ohio\\" on pages 74-75, \\"Old Man\\" on pages 78-81, \\"Harvest\\" on pages 90-94, \\"The Needle and the Damage Done\\" on pages 96-99, and I already mentioned some of the more recent numbers.  The last song in the book is \\"Long May You Run\\" from 1976, suggested for Bright Country Style.

Instead of `her,' the description of \\"The Turn of the Screw\\" which correctly states, \\"it is her ordeal to be the only one who sees\\" when the ghosts appear, then has \\"but here ordeal subtly changes into obsession.\\"  (p. ix).  In the story, \\"The Beast in the Jungle,\\" the word `bankrupt' is given an extra r, so the list of things which the main character has not been branded by reads, \\"It wouldn't have been failure to be brankrupt, dishonoured, pilloried, hanged; it was failure not to be anything.\\"  (p. 471).<br />The characters in \\"The Beast in the Jungle\\" are man and woman, concerned with an idea which she brings up when they finally meet again, \\"that again and again has made me think of you since; it was that tremendously hot day when we went to Sorrento, across the bay, for the breeze.\\"  (p. 453).  Mostly he had tried to remove the element of comedy from their conversation.  \\"What he had asked of her had been simply at first not to laugh at him.  She had beautifully not done so for ten years, and she was not doing so now.\\"  (p. 455).  He had furnished a deep sense of foreboding that he might be overwhelmed by something \\"possibly annihilating everything, striking at the root of all my world and leaving me to the consequences, however they shape themselves.\\"  (p. 456).  After ten years of thinking about how it might happen, she was brave enough to ask, \\"Isn't what you describe perhaps but the expectation--or at any rate the sense of danger, familiar to so many people--of falling in love?\\"  (p. 456).  Those who have fallen off the deep end in the other direction might have more ideas for weird movies than this story ends up with.<br />On a more comic note, I think this book illustrates American ideas as being like a little girl who is expecting to be queen of the world, but when she is growing up, she discovers that she is only Daisy Miller.  The story, \\"The Pupil,\\" might be a sign of how readily America could adopt the task of teaching the rest of the world America's democratic values, only to discover that the world doesn't want to be pandered to as much as it would like real support.  Short works of Henry James amount to only six stories in 490 pages, ranging from 18,000 to 71,000 words each.<br />I also have a book by Stephen Donadio called NIETZSCHE, HENRY JAMES, AND THE ARTISTIC WILL.  Published in 1978, a major part of that book (pages 62-118) started me thinking about the relationship of \\"American Identity, Universal Culture, and the Unbounded Self.\\"  Henry James was born a year before Nietzsche and lived to the middle of World War I, so their lives had some common elements, and Donadio had a lot to say about Ralph Waldo Emerson, who died in 1882, as someone who appeared to be one of the most advanced thinkers of the time to both Nietzsche and Henry James.

US	41560427	R1V7PAPDB0YYHM	0374113157	189677178	The Double Bond: The Life of Primo Levi	Books	5	3	22	N	N	Kind of crazy, in a world crazier than he was	As awful as current events seem to be, with unsettled questions about who is most likely to die next dominating much of the news, this book takes a look at how a great writer managed, as best he could, for a time.  Applying political psychology to figures who assumed some importance in our evaluation of the most catastrophic events in the twentieth century can still be disconcerting, as I myself might be the worst example.  Part of the joke of MY VIETNAM WAR JOKE BOOK was that a 19-year-old G.I. grunt in Nam might say things that you would never expect to hear from the kind of genius who survived Auschwitz and wrote about it in the manner of Primo Levi in THE PERIODIC TABLE, which was an American best-seller when it was translated into English.<br />Carole Angier seems very English and aiming for an audience at a university level of views, far removed from the concerns of those Americans who need a little more control over what is happening in the world, as expressed in an article in The New York Times of March 31, 2003, of a situation which is assumed to be temporary:<br />Eleven days into the American-led war here, the narrow, once fertile crescent of territory that gives Iraq its only outlet to the sea remains a land of insecurity and ambivalence, devoid of the euphoria that American and British soldiers hoped to encounter in southern Iraq.<br />People who experienced a sense of euphoria in reading Primo Levi's reflections on life as an understanding of chemical elements are sure to find THE DOUBLE BOND by Carole Angier dismal evidence that Primo Levi's life remained \\"a land of insecurity and ambivalence,\\" and that the inability to write which marked his final days was primarily a lack of the sense of euphoria that newspaper reporters Marc Santora and Craig S. Smith, writing for the Times, had assumed that Americans would expect for those encountered in great historical events.<br />This is a big book with a tremendous index, but most people will find that few of the people listed in the index are familiar to them, though two lines are required for the pages on \\"Americans,\\" as distinct from the three lines for \\"America/United States.\\"  There are also listings for \\"Britain\\" and \\"England,\\" but no extended discussion of the controversy there, in which David Irving is listed for a single page, on the book, HITLER'S WAR.  American and England are such outlying areas in the scope of Levi's concerns that the description of his \\"barrage of articles\\" (p. 603) trying to counter Holocaust denial seems obsessed with the French.  THE DOUBLE BOND is hardly neutral, but mentions such disconcerting facts as that Louis Darquier de Pellepoix was Vichy's commissioner of Jewish affairs.  \\"Darquier was eighty-five years old and clearly senile, he said; since he himself had sent 70,000 French Jews to their deaths, he was hardly a disinterested party.\\"  (p. 603).  The word \\"disinterested\\" here must primarily mean disinterested in the truth.  I just received news that a newsman, Peter Arnett, (I am the face), was fired by an American network for talking in Baghdad on Iraqi TV.  The standard applied in his case was hardly whether he was still capable of thinking of interesting things to say, but more along the lines of whether other people ought to be given the opportunity to believe what he was thinking.<br />In these interesting times, MY VIETNAM WAR JOKE BOOK is the worst possible point of view because its interest is primarily in laughing.  Primo Levi could never have written MY VIETNAM WAR JOKE BOOK, because he did not have the personal interest in pursuing that situation past its most absurd conclusion, that geopolitics could be responsible for the deaths of 3,000,000 Vietnamese without ultimately accepting any responsibility for the fate of the survivors.  Levi had math for Europe:  \\"There had been 17 million Jews in Europe in 1939, and 11 million in 1945:  where were the missing 6 million?\\"  (p. 603).  There might be fewer people in Iraq ina few months than there were a month ago, but Levi is a poor candidate (he's dead, you know) for thinking that anyone could be more disinterested in that than he is.<br />On the question of therapeutic value of trying to provide attention to those who need it most, the tangled web in this book is tied to older lives:  \\"from 1978 onwards his depressions were triggered very largely by his mother's decline, and by its consequences.  But it was also not true, because neither was natural or external.  The truth is that his own relationship with his mother was pathological; and so was the level of care Lucia required them both to give.  These together were quite enough to depress him on their own.\\"  (p. 602).  This is entirely like his relationship to \\"those who denied the crimes he had devoted his life to recording.  They, and they alone, brought out in him absolute intolerance; and a violence of language (`senile', `stupid', `mad') which was to him the essence of the Lager, and normally beyond the pale.  The appearance of Faurisson and his ilk was the deepest shock to him:  perhaps as deep as the shock of Auschwitz itself.  These new Nazis lived in peace and safety, unlike the original ones.\\"  (p. 604).  Having experienced a bit of shock ourselves, it is not too surprising that some governments have an interest in bringing a bit of shock to Iraq, but hardly like the shock Levi brought when he died in the house where he had been born, Corso Re Umberto 75, \\"built in the good middle-class areas of Turin around the turn of the century.\\"  (p. xxiv).  This book honors his life, and is a profound appreciation of the nature and meaning of his death, too.a few months than there were a month ago, but Levi is a poor candidate (he's dead, you know) for thinking that anyone could be more disinterested in that than he is.<br />On the question of therapeutic value of trying to provide attention to those who need it most, the tangled web in this book is tied to older lives:  \\"from 1978 onwards his depressions were triggered very largely by his mother's decline, and by its consequences.

It wouldn't be so psychotic if the story was not set so late in his life that this compulsion to repeat his behavior whenever he encounters the same stimuli is likely to put him in the hospital.  I can't remember where I put this book at the moment, but I'm sure the story is in A SENTIMENTAL EDUCATION because it helped me appreciate Joyce Carol Oates as a writer who is capable of revealing the moments that tell us the most about who we are.<br />Modern readers deserve to have their emotions described for them in the kinds of settings which they are increasingly exposed to in a world that pushes information overload to a point where even a simple sexual fantasy, presented in the story, \\"The Tryst,\\" ends in a macabre mess that is in danger of being reported on the local evening news.  Events at the largest level reflect tiny episodes in our past, as the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, in which a young George Bush helped transfer two naval vessels into the covert supply ships, the \\"Houston\\" and the \\"Barbara,\\" could be preparation for a President Bush of a later generation to supply Americans to the unfree people of Iraq for their liberation.  Considering people in another country so unfree that the United States does everything it can do to encourage the people to overthrow the government that is bothering the U.S. most at the moment is scant preparation for sending Americans to face the situation on the ground, come sandstorms or high water, which would be really unusual in Iraq, but it might be compared to what readers could learn about people from this book, which is small but can still be as shocking as any newspaper.	2003-03-29
US	41560427	R1TT71JZQT0DRQ	B00008AJC1	62418067	Inherited Risk: Errol Flynn and Sean Flynn in Hollywood and Vietnam	Books	4	6	10	N	N	Two subjects with the same pathos	There is a tendency to describe people whose lives veer into chaos far more frequently than our own as troubled.  The balance is provided in this book by rendering an account of how superior the lives of ERROL AND SEAN FLYNN IN HOLLYWOOD AND VIETNAM seem compared to the rest of us.  I'm partial to this account because I was already a fan of the Flynn associates in Nam:  Tim Page, Michael Herr, John Steinbeck IV, Robert Sam Anson, and Dana Stone.  Dana Stone gets credit for taking the photo in Ha Than in 1968 in which Sean Flynn, \\"In full battle dress and holding a grenade, with arms outstretched and right boot in midair, he charges over the top of the hill and attacks the North Vietnamese enemy. . . . After the officer was wounded, Sean saved the day by assuming one of Errol's movie roles, leading the charge himself and killing an enemy soldier.\\"  (pp. 55-56).  There are few pictures of Sean in this book, but real fans will have the collection in REQUIEM:  BY THE PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO DIED IN VIETNAM AND INDOCHINA, edited by Horst Faas and Tim Page.<br />The picture of Sean Flynn and Dana Stone on motorcycles in Vietnam, c. 1970, facing page 97, might be rough for those whose expectations were shaped by Jack Warner's \\"considerable shrewdness and a clear grasp of public taste.\\"  (caption to picture 11).  Errol Flynn was interesting enough to dominate the first 29 pictures in this book.  Then number 30 shows Sean Flynn with a friend, Steve Cutter, in 1958, and the final page of pictures shows the contrast between the highly professional look of an American studio portrait, c. 1962, and how Sean and Dana would look when last seen by Western eyes.<br />If armies are usually considered highly disciplined, as well as the most modern, civilized mechanism for establishing order in the midst of chaos, Sean and Dana miscalculated how outrageously the enemy in Cambodia would be striving for something else, that they hadn't counted upon.  A journalist card issued by the U.S. Department of Defense was supposed to be sufficient to convince the inhabitants of this planet that they possessed the opportunity to have their story told to the world, and the cameras should have convinced the enemy that the main thing the Americans wanted to take was pictures.  Part of Sean's trouble was that he was expecting to see more than the usual amount of trouble.  The previous year, Sean spent a few days in jail in Djakarta because of a 17-year-old high school girl, daughter of a Caltex corporation lawyer and a princess from Sumatra,  \\"named after a Hindu goddess.\\"  (p. 49).  For me (still an effetely snobbish reader and broadcaster of my own opinions), being in the army was like spending two years with the Djakarta taxi driver who drove Sean and the girl to her home in his Mercedes taxi.  The taxi driver assumed that the girl was the hot attraction that Sean thought she was and returned with a Chinese businessman.  The story is related partly in words that Sean wrote to his mother November 2 and December 4, 1969, which admitted that Sean \\"stepped out of the bushes swinging a baseball bat.  He smashed the car's and windshield, then attacked the driver.  The Chinese customer meanwhile had fled.\\"  (p. 49).<br />Tying it all together like this book does is a hoot:  \\"American officers expected extraordinary courage from Errol's son and Sean always met their expectations.  Accompanying the 4th Division's long-range recon patrollers for a month, Sean walked point on dangerous four-man patrols in the northern Highlands.  He stayed in a besieged bunker at Kon Tien where, in only three days, 375 Marines were wounded.\\"  (p. 51).  As famous as Sean Flynn became, it might still be possible to find 375 Marines who remember being wounded in the same bunker at Kon Tien, but it seems more likely they were wounded at Con Thien when Sean was in some other country.  Sean probably had more combat experience than most of the guys on walking recon patrols for the 4th Division, who previously were more likely to have some incident of looking for a lost pet in their childhood than of finding anything in the Highlands.  Most of the 4th Division called it the Central Highlands.  Up north, where the Marine operated, Con Thien was at one end of the McNamara Line on the map on page 127 of HISTORICAL ATLAS OF THE VIETNAM WAR by Harry G. Summers, Jr.  According to an official count in that book, 3,077 mortar, artillery, and rocket rounds struck the base there during the week of September 19-27, 1967, only three months after Sean Flynn photographed the results of the six-day Arab-Israeli War, when, \\"On his way back from Sinai, Sean dragged a recoilless rifle behind his rented Volkswagen and gave it to Mandy Rice-Davies (who had been implicated in the John Profumo spy-and-sex scandal in Britain and had emigrated to Israel) to decorate her discotheque in Tel Aviv.\\"  (Meyers, p. 45).<br />Most of ERROL AND SEAN FLYNN IN HOLLYWOOD AND VIETNAM is devoted to the life of Errol Flynn, pages 59-303.  His death of a heart attack was rather pathetic, as the doctors in those days seemed better able to find heart problems in an autopsy setting than \\"when Flynn suddenly felt sharp pains in his back and legs.\\"  (p. 295).  A doctor told him to ease the pain by lying on the floor.  \\"After an autopsy, the coroner found that his death was caused by myocardial infarction (blood not reaching the heart), coronary thrombosis (clot in the coronary blood vessels) and coronary atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).\\"  (p. 295).  Errol's mother, Marelle, wrote to Sean two months later that \\"my poor boy knew that he had not long to live.  He had several heart attacks, & had been warned seriously only a short time ago.\\"  (p. 295).reviously were more likely to have some incident of looking for a lost pet in their childhood than of finding anything in the Highlands.

Philosophically, American foreign policy was the area in which people were most likely to become early illustrations of the final sentence of Section 354 of THE GAY SCIENCE by Friedrich Nietzsche:<br />We simply have no organ for knowing, for `truth': we `know' (or believe and imagine) exactly as much as is useful to the human herd, to the species: and even what is here called `usefulness' is finally also just a belief, a fiction, and perhaps just that supremely fatal stupidity of which we some day will perish.<br />Quisling was Norway's perfect Nazi in the way that the Saigon government was always the perfect forerunner of democracy as far as American policy (\\"just a belief, a fiction, and perhaps\\" just what Nietzsche wrote) was concerned. The assumption that people in South Vietnam, after 1954, when their (SVN) government was largely determined by what the United States was willing to impose or maintain, would be willing to die so their future might improve was as obvious to those who find the kiss of death the ultimate test in logic as Quisling's belief that people in Norway would not die if the government of Norway welcomed the Germans instead of attempting to fight an invasion. Each policy was supported by factions in the U.S. government. President Kennedy preferred to maintain the fiction that Saigon's government was a perfect Quisling, so Americans should assume that any American would be as safe in South Vietnam as German officials might feel entitled to safety in Norway during World War II. The anti-Quisling factor never really accepted the idea of Quisling as an ideal ally. The original Quisling was a Nazi, after all, and allowing anyone else the opportunity to die for our freedom was not the kiss of death, as far as they were concerned.<br />An outline of Ellsberg's book, SECRETS, splitting the factions as they appear in particular settings, might turn out like:<br />I. Preface, Ellsberg alone, \\"carrying a briefcase filled with top secret documents,\\" (p. VII) determined to show that American policy was \\"just a belief, a fiction, and perhaps just\\" (what Nietzsche wrote) as secret as Quisling's plans to topple the government of Norway at the right time for the Germans. Ellsberg, acting in secret, is practically Quisling himself, without actually being a Nazi.<br />Part 1, Prologue: Vietnam 1961, the view \\"that under President Ngo Dinh Diem, the dictatorial leader we had essentially chosen for South Vietnam seven years earlier, the Communists would almost surely take power eventually, probably within a year or two.\\" (p. 3) This shows how Quisling politics works when everyone knows that the next Quisling would be worse. \\" . . . the Communists would probably win even faster. His reasoning was informed and complex; my notes of our discussion are filled with diagrams of `vicious circles,' a whole network of them. It was persuasive.\\" The view of the anti-Quisling prospects, \\"But even American divisions, this colonel believed, would only postpone the outcome. The Communists would govern soon after our forces left, whenever that might be.\\" (p. 4). This ultimately made any American policy \\"finally also just a belief, a fiction, and perhaps just that supremely fatal stupidity of which\\" Nietzsche wrote.<br />Chapter 1, The Tonkin Gulf: August 1964: The message, \\"Am under continuous torpedo attack,\\" (p. 7) was just what anti-Quisling factors like LBJ needed to impress Americans with how brave bombers from Navy aircraft carriers could invade enemy airspace at will to impose reprisals for stunts like \\"Herrick reported another torpedo had run by him, and two more were in the water.\\" (p. 7). \\"Torpedoes missed. Another fired at us. Four torpedoes in water. And five torpedoes in water.\\" (p. 9). Ellsberg could determine, based on \\"In my new job I wasreading the daily transcripts of this secret testimony, and at the same time I was learning from cables, reports, and discussion in the Pentagon the background that gave the lie to virtually everything told both to the public and, more elaborately, to Congress in secret session.\\" (p. 13). As far as South Vietnam acting as our Quisling, Ellsberg learned that covert raids attacking North Vietnam had just taken place, and \\"these weren't South Vietnamese operations at all, not even joint operations. They were entirely U.S. operations, code-named 34A ops.\\" (p. 14). In the realm of \\"their illegality, the danger both of exposure and of escalation, and their covertness, defined as `plausible deniability'--\\" (p. 15) South Vietnam as Quisling was only the cover story for what America was doing in a way that was altogether improper.<br />For a lot of people, American involvement in Vietnam was the kiss of death for American foreign policy, and no one is as qualified to tell that story as well as Daniel Ellsberg can and does in this book.  The philosophy of Nietzsche might be considered an unusual personal choice for attempting to communicate how American policy was supposed to be more important than multiple young American lives at the time.  I haven't read enough philosophy to find another famous theory that could come as close to my view of Nam. ...reading the daily transcripts of this secret testimony, and at the same time I was learning from cables, reports, and discussion in the Pentagon the background that gave the lie to virtually everything told both to the public and, more elaborately, to Congress in secret session.\\" (p. 13).

Most of the action takes place in New York City, where John Lennon also discovered that he was not entirely welcome, possibly for some of the same reasons that Bertrand Russell was a problem. While there is some concern in this book for free speech, the opposition to Russell was mainly a problem for people who might be held responsible politically for the taxpayer dollars that Russell was so concerned about getting. The British earl (3-times-married, twice divorced) needed enough income to provide for his child of two, at a time when \\"probably the world's most renowned living philosopher\\" (p. 10) was only two years short of the mandatory retirement age. This book was written before the events of September 11, 2001, and seems totally unaware of the possibility that anyone who disagrees with the financial control exercised by New York City over global economics could hijack airplanes and use them to reduce large buildings to rubble. America is fortunate that a plane on September 11, 2001 also struck the Pentagon, so the federal government had a direct military attack which it could respond to in a like manner (air superiority being a prime consideration in superpower planning for geopolitical dominance). The military use of aircraft has become an American obsession as critical to American geopolitical machinations as intellect is a distinguishing feature in the ideology which thinks it rules in New York City and in the mind of Ralph Nader.<br />The index has a lot of distinguished names, including Augustine, Bruce Barton, Bismarck, Giordano Bruno, Neville Chamberlain, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Euclid, Sigmund Freud, Galileo Galilei, Hegel, Werner Heisenberg, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Thomas Jefferson, James Joyce, Lenin, Martin Luther, Karl Marx, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Plato, St. Joan of Arc Holy Name Society, Socrates, Baruch de Spinoza, Stalin, Trotsky, Voltaire, Woodrow Wilson, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. There is only a single entry for the Communist Party, none for the Democratic Party, and only a few pages are cited for Young Communist League and Young People's Socialist League. I am not related in any way to the Bruce Barton whose views on religion are so well known that the president of Hunter College, George N. Shuster, a lay Catholic, could describe other Catholics as \\"`like a blend of' the Daughters of the American Revolution, advertising man Bruce Barton, `and a random devotee of Torquemada,' the evil medieval inquisitor. Of their moralizing, he said that Catholics could see `nothing in the universe but middle-class primness--an order to avoid shocking some imaginary schoolgirl' (these were prescient words concerning Russell's predicament).\\" (p. 86).<br />My own interest in the role of the Democratic party in this book is a result of the situation for the appointment of federal judges, now that the Democrats no longer have control of the U.S. Senate, which has the power to approve such appointments and have tried to make this seem like an important role for protecting the rights of people who think that there is more to life than just getting married and having children. Prior to the appointment of George Shuster, the president of Hunter College was Eugene Colligan, \\"a political hack, installed when Tammany Hall, the notorious Manhattan Democratic machine, was still running the city (though not for much longer). . . . At the college's 1935 commencement exercises, the rowdy audience held placards charging `Colligan Lives Up to Mussolini's \\"Order of Merit\\"' (the fascist leader had bestowed upon him the Italian Medal of Merit for `distinguished educational accomplishment').\\" (p. 11). Throughout this book, the leadership of Protestant Episcopal Bishop William T. Manning of the Diocese of New York combines with the kind of politics that Democrats have spent years using, appealing to popular animus to try to avert the kind of confusion which the future is bound to run into sooner or later.<br />Those who learned the most about political advantages were students who had the opportunity to promote their own interests.

The most they can say about some things is, \\"One was a plan to inject nerve gas into the Egyptian leader's office.  The scheme was allegedly approved by Eden before he suspended it in preference for military intervention.\\"  (pp. 70-71).  As a reader who finds secrets enticing, I found their comments on the more exciting topics, which this book is not supposed to be about, entirely in character.  Sometimes I found the terminology a bit confusing:  \\"The RAF flew operations to drop propaganda leaflets on the Egyptian population.  The problem was that the `leaflet bombs' were designed to explode at 1,000 ft, using an altitude fuse, and scatter paper over a wide area.  However, because of barometric differences in Egypt, the bombs exploded at just 6 ft causing death or injury to any Egyptian in the vicinity - a real own goal.\\"  (p. 71).  If this book is to be a guide for government activities in Arab parts of the world, the story of a British director of a station broadcasting Arabic propaganda is a lesson that should impress some people:<br />Then, as D-Day for Operation Musketeer arrived, he was told to change the name of the station to The Voice of Britain.  Grasping exactly what was about to happen, the director of the station went on air and warned the Egyptian audience that it would shortly be hearing lies and might experience bombing.  It was not to believe the lies and must endure the bombs; these acts were not those of Englishmen who knew Arabia and cared for Arab people.  He was promptly arrested by the British military for his trouble.  The director was brought back to England and removed from any public platform.  (p. 73).<br />There was also an Arab News Agency, \\"secretly funded by the British government,\\" (p. 72) which had been \\"the short-lived and now defunct Balkan News Agency.\\" (p. 72).  It had been evacuated to Egypt when the Germans invaded the Balkans.  It provided an Arabic language teletype service, charging \\"very little for its service and frequently gave it away without charge.\\"  (p. 73).  When England was ready for its pre-emptive strike, \\"Tom Little and his Cairo team were not in favor of Anthony Eden's military intervention and thought that the British cabinet was misreading Nasser.  This stance must have been pretty clear to the Egyptians as Little managed to retain a friendship with Nasser throughout these difficult times.\\"  (p. 73).  This book is supposed to be about the activities of people like Sefton Delmer, who was added to the Cairo staff \\"as the Suez crisis worsened in the summer of 1956, the British cabinet's plan for toppling Nasser called for several months of psychological warfare to be followed by military intervention if this did not work.\\"  (p. 70).  \\"Delmer and Stevenson's propaganda objective was to equate Nasser with Hitler, which was Eden's view.\\"  (p. 70).<br />Chapter One is called \\"Indonesia:  Prelude to Slaughter.\\"  The simple explanation of everything has always been:  \\"As a result of Sukarno's overthrow some 500,000 Indonesians - suspected Communists - were killed.\\"  (p. 1).  In late 1965, \\"Britain sent a Foreign Office propaganda specialist with 100,000 pounds `to do anything I could to get rid of Sukarno.'\\"  (p. 1).  \\"By 1959, Britain's investments in Indonesia were in the region of 300 million pounds.\\"  (p. 2)  The Indonesian Communist Party, \\"which by 1965 had a membership of over 10 million - the largest Communist Party in the non-Communist world\\" (p. 3) was supporting Ahmed Sukarno, who had been declared Indonesia's first president in 1945.  \\"And in 1955, Sukarno held the Bandung Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement, increasing suspicion in both Britain and the USA. . . . On May 18, 1958, the Indonesians shot down one of those B-26s and captured the pilot, an American named Allen Pope.\\"  (p. 3).  If you didn't know anything about\\"those B-26s,\\" you might be unaware that CIA planes were carrying out bombing missions to aid insurgents, something that the British and Americans now do openly over parts of Iraq, since the last failure of everybody to rebel against a leading enemy, in Iraq.  In Indonesia, the biggest support for regime change was in the army.  According to BBC correspondent Roland Challis, \\"So it's not particularly surprising . . . you would get army people saying, look, this old fool is past his time.  You know, he's going gaga, he's in bed with 700 wives.  And of course, one would get rid of him.\\"  (p. 5).  At the start of the coup, \\"Six key army generals were killed,\\" (p. 6) but Soeharto had been at a military hospital visiting his son and set about eliminating those Communists who would be the main obstacle to military rule.  Sukarno \\"attempted to preserve his power and to prevent an all-out bloodbath,\\" (p. 8) but the slaughter seemed to favor British and American interests.  Roland Challis noticed how propaganda \\"was managing to transfer the whole idea of Communism on to the Chinese minority in Indonesia.  It turned into an ethnic thing.\\"  (p. 8).  In 1990, American investigative journalists revealed that the CIA supplied \\"as many as 5,000 names of suspected senior members of the PKI . . .  In effect it was a hit-list which helped the army in its bloody task of physically eradicating the PKI:  US Embassy officials followed the progress by checking off names as reports arrived of individual murders and arrests.\\"  (p. 9).

US	41560427	RTH01L54UG8WJ	0838313183	302446223	Egotism in German Philosophy	Books	3	5	8	N	N	German philosophy up to WWI	George Santayana (1863-1952) was born in Madrid, Spain, but he had an American mother. I believe EGOTISM IN GERMAN PHILOSOPHY was written in 1916, though I do not see any copyright information except \\"All rights reserved\\" in the old hardcover copy I just read. In the Preface, which mentioned \\"the present war,\\" the author admits, \\"During more than twenty years, while I taught philosophy at Harvard College, I had continual occasion to read and discuss German metaphysics.\\" (p. 5). After his Spanish father's death in 1912, Santayana's inheritance was sufficient to allow him to give up teaching and move to Rome. When I acquired this book, I expected an American point of view, fraught with anticipation of being dragged into a fight which was not of our own choosing. German philosophy could be considered as a factor for which Germans expected us to fear having to fight the Germans precisely because it could contribute to understanding what we would be up against. This book seems to be more interested in arguments against Egotism than in practical considerations in which politics would be the prime consideration for deciding who should defend civilization as we expect it to continue thriving on the weight of arguments for and against how American participation might push things one way or the other in the great war which is now considered World War One.<br />The intervening 96 years have provided the world with the political example of Adolf Hitler, a master of putting German feelings into words that defied the rest of the world so emotionally that almost everyone understands how the Germans thought that he was on their side, even if no one else would. Santayana seems to be opposed to that kind of national Egotism, but his writing is limited to the examples in philosophy which preceded it. As the Preface says, \\"They merely shared and justified prophetically that spirit of uncompromising self-assertion and metaphysical conceit which the German nation is now reducing to action.\\" (p. 7). The religious background is surveyed for foundations of individual philosophies:<br />Kant was a puritan; he revered the rule of right as something immutable and holy, perhaps never obeyed in the world. Fichte was somewhat freer in his Calvinism; the rule of right was the moving power in all life and nature, though it might have been betrayed by a doomed and self-seeking generation. Hegel was a very free and superior Lutheran; he saw that the divine will was necessarily and continuously realised in this world, though we might not recognise the fact in our petty moral judgments. Schopenhauer, speaking again for this human judgment, revolted against that cruel optimism, and was an indignant atheist; and finally, in Nietzsche, this atheism became exultant; he thought it the part of a man to abet the movement of things, however calamitous, in order to appropriate its wild force and be for a moment the very crest of its wave. (p. 25)<br />Calvin had an early influence. \\"In Kant, who in this matter followed Calvin, the independence between the movement of nature, both within and without the soul, and the ideal of right was exaggerated into an opposition. The categorical imperative was always authoritative, but perhaps never obeyed. The divine law was far from being like the absolute Will in Fichte, Hegel, and Schopenhauer. . . . On the contrary the sublimity of the categorical imperative lay precisely in the fact that, while matter and life moved on in their own unregenerate way, a principle which they ought to follow, overarched and condemned them, and constrained them to condemn themselves. Human nature was totally depraved and incapable of the least merit, nor had it any power of itself to become righteous. Its amiable spontaneous virtues, having but a natural motive, were splendid vices.\\" (p. 57).<br />In the index, Max Stirner is listed under M, probably because his real name wasn't Max Stirner, and he is hardly considered real. \\"The work of Max Stirner on the single separate person and what he may call his own hardly belongs to German philosophy as I have been using the words: it lacks the transcendental point of departure, as well as all breadth of view, metaphysical subtlety, or generous afflatus; it is a bold, frank, and rather tiresome protest against the folly of moral idealism, against the sacrifice of the individual to any ghostly powers such as God, duty, the state, humanity, or society; all of which this redoubtable critic called `spooks' and regarded as fixed ideas and pathological obsessions. This crudity was relieved by a strong mother-wit and a dogged honesty; and it is not impossible that this poor schoolmaster, in his solitary meditations, may have embodied prophetically a rebellion against polite and religious follies which is brewing in the working classes.\\" (p. 99) Karl Marx is not mentioned in this book, but it seems to me that Marx may have learned from \\"Saint Max\\" what the average American of today learns by watching TV. Television is not mentioned, or expected, in this book, but George Santayana might have seen one sometime before he died, and I'll bet he heard Hitler on the radio within 20 years after he wrote this book.<br />Anarchy is not listed in the index of this book, but the tendency in that direction becomes apparent with \\"A highest good to be obtained apart from each and every specific interest is more than unattainable; it is unthinkable.\\" (p. 111). Schopenhauer can easily represent \\"the spirit of opposition; his righteous wrath was aroused by the sardonic and inhuman optimism of Hegel, the arguments for which were so cogent, so Calvinistic, and so irrelevant that they would have lost none of their force if they had been proposed in hell.\\" (p. 111). \\"The ground of life, the Will in all things, was something lurid and tempestuous, itself a psychological chaos. The alternative to theism in the mind of Schopenhauer was not naturalism but anarchy.\\" (p. 112). \\"The romantic travesty of life and this conception of metaphysical anarchy were inherited by Nietzsche and regarded by him as the last word of philosophy. . . . Romantic anarchy delighted him; and he crowned it with a rakish optimism, as with the red cap of Liberty.\\" (pp. 112-3). The logic of the rest of the text, which ends on page 168 in this old hardcover, has a lot to say about what Nietzsche did not accomplish as a philosopher. I wish people would have more awareness of what anarchy might await those who disregard the present systems that still hold it back, but this book never promised to be about that question.n the single separate person and what he may call his own hardly belongs to German philosophy as I have been using the words: it lacks the transcendental point of departure, as well as all breadth of view, metaphysical subtlety, or generous afflatus; it is a bold, frank, and rather tiresome protest against the folly of moral idealism, against the sacrifice of the individual to any ghostly powers such as God, duty, the state, humanity, or society; all of which this redoubtable critic called `spooks' and regarded as fixed ideas and pathological obsessions.

High school students doing a research paper might ask their teachers if a single volume of this nature could provide sufficient citations for a research paper which is supposed to show a comparison of a variety of sources.  Of the 20 authors in this book, Telford Taylor, an American prosecutor of war crimes at Nuremberg, and Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. Attorney General, are the most familiar to me.<br />After declaring that Nuremberg Trials in 1945 were \\"the first time in history that an international court successfully tried and convicted war criminals,\\" (p. 9) establishing \\"a great moral principle\\" (p. 9) \\"that the planning and waging of aggressive war is the greatest crime known to mankind and that those guilty of perpetrating it shall be punished,\\" (p. 10) it took until 1995 to bring an action against \\"Dusan Tadic, the first suspected war criminal to be tried since the end of World War II.\\"  (p. 10).<br />Chapter 1, \\"An Examination of War Crimes,\\" attempts to establish rules of war, and lists results from the 22 leading Nazis tried before the International Military Tribunal (November 20, 1945, to October 1, 1946), 185 other leading Germans \\"indicted before 12 tribunals, composed exclusively of United States judges,\\" (p. 22) and a Tokyo international tribunal established on January 19, 1946.  The French trials of \\"Marshal Henri Philippe Petain and Pierre Laval--respectively head of state and prime minister of France's Vichy regime\\" (p. 23) and the trial of Vidkun Quisling, who managed to take over the government in Norway to prevent opposition to a German invasion, were also famous.  After a long delay and some unusual capturing of the suspect, the abducted Adolf Eichmann was tried in 1961 \\"before the High Court of Israel.\\"  (p. 23)<br />Chapter 1 also includes a selection by Samantha Powers on \\"The Persistence of Genocide.\\"  An article by Valerie Oosterveld on crimes of sexual violence is reprinted from UNESCO Courier, August 1998, contains reports of mass rape in the former Yugoslavia and charges of sexual violence charged by the Rwanda Tribunal.  David J. Scheffer was the U.S. Ambassador at Large for War Crimes, and part of a speech he gave on February 24, 1998 is included.  A Sharon Clarke article on \\"the West's right to sit in judgement on the rest of the world?\\" (p. 42) is reprinted from Living Marxism, July 1993.<br />Chapter 2, \\"War Crimes:  A Historical Overview\\" starts with \\"The Development of the Laws of War\\" by Telford Taylor.  In an article by Eric Norden, originally called \\"American Atrocities in Vietnam,\\" reprinted from Liberation, 1966, Norden wrote, \\"Many U.S. reporters have witnessed torture first-hand.\\"  (p. 77).  Donald Wise, chief foreign correspondent for the London Sunday Mirror, reported, \\"Inevitably, innocent peasants are kneed . . . or die of loss of blood after interrogation.\\"  (p. 77)  The ceasefire agreement signed by the responsible parties in January, 1973, finally provided an agreement that prisoners would not be tortured, but it was a criminal offense (not mentioned in this book) to distribute copies of the agreement in South Vietnam.  Other topics in the Vietnam article include \\"Senseless Air Raids\\" (pp. 84-86) which ends with the word `napalm,' and the following section \\"described how artillery blasted their village the night before.\\"  (p. 86).  Albert Schweitzer was even called \\"correct when he wrote:  `It is clear now to everyone that the suicide of civilization is in progress.' \\"  (p. 88).  This is a book for young people, and I think Nam was the last war that was considered euthanasia for youth in Asia, and there is more fear that will happen again than that Americans will ever do anything wrong.<br />Chapter 3, \\"Personal Reflections on War Crimes\\" starts with \\"The Prison Camps\\" by Peter Maass, excerpted from a book he wrote.  \\"After cleansing one-third of Croatia, Serb militias are cleansing Bosnia. . . . The campaign in Bosnia is far bloodier.\\"  (p. 101).  \\"Perpetrating the Crimes\\" on page 115 is about Yuasa Ken, a doctor in the Japanese army who used Chinese prisoners to train Japanese doctors by performing unnecessary operations.  \\"Imprisoned in China as a war criminal until 1956, Yuasa relates that although he has confessed and acknowledged his horrible crimes, most of his colleagues pretend as though they never took part in such gruesome incidents.\\"  (p. 115).  On his colleagues, \\"But they still keep their mouths shut.  If they were to recall it, it would be unbearable.  That's why they are silent.  It was `because of the war.'  That's enough for them.\\"  (p. 120).

US	41560427	R321W463TFUI1L	1587215136	495689262	Laughing War	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A Meaningful Relic	The hardcover copy of this book that I have came out in 1980, a good year for me (I was 33) to be thinking about what I was going to be doing for the rest of my life.  Nobody was expecting my life to be so much like this book, and I have no memory of what year this book actually became mine.  As the intellectual level of televised life has declined to reflect the lack of thoughtfulness of the media which bring us the most important information we have to go on, I must have figured that this book would be about Nam, as soon as I saw it.  Crimes against humor (a network cancelled the Smothers Brothers comedy hour) were so common during the war itself, when laughing at Nam was supposed to be much worse than going to Nam to fight, LAUGHING WAR by Martyn Burke had to be about the great tension required for seriously maintaining an activity that became increasingly absurd.  I was once in Nam to escalate the winding down, and finding myself in disagreement with the army (like having my own secret plan for peace) was perfectly natural, as in this book.<br />Comedy has become such a business that the information in this book which might still be considered most useful relates to how a comic routine must reflect a particular character to connect with an audience and be successful.  There are chapters on Barney (\\"Most of Barney's comedy material came from watching the war\\"), Donna (\\"the Garbo of the Catinat, coming and going when few people saw her\\"), Isaacs (\\"Bitterness wells up inside Isaacs and he decides that he prefers the enemy at the front to the enemy behind him. . . . It is Abbie Hoffman, exhorting his multitudes with anarchistic wisecracks that sound to Isaacs like treason\\"), Jokes, and finally, Laughing War itself.  If there is a possibility that something like Nam will crop up again, with the help of this book, people who want to be comedians will be able to spot it first and tell everybody about the hard times that are about to come down.  Anyone who is trying to make sense of civilization will be hard pressed by the case which this book makes against the foolishness of using all of its destructive power in an attempt to wipe out all opposition.<br />In the chapter on Isaacs there is a paragraph about a sergeant who was \\"bored by the jokes.  They remind the sergeant too much of the kind he used to hear at the strip shows with the traveling carnivals.  They were all hick comedians in those shows.  With corny jokes.\\"  That is all most people expect, and it was great to read this comic effort to bring people to another level.  More than just liking this book, I try to live it.make sense of civilization will be hard pressed by the case which this book makes against the foolishness of using all of its destructive power in an attempt to wipe out all opposition.<br />In the chapter on Isaacs there is a paragraph about a sergeant who was \\"bored by the jokes.

US	41560427	R3IKCWWHVC7W1G	0415900573	762081156	Acts of Literature	Books	4	3	29	N	N	A challenge to read	I'm used to reading philosophy, but I might be too dark and dour to comment on this kind of book.  Given an ambiguous situation, I have major problems seeing how it might have anything to do with me.  Even if comedy was an art form, I might not be funny, or even meaningful, or in any way like this book.  Considering the impossible situations that I have imagined myself in, as in: If Nam was a joke, I was the straight man; this book seems to be another instance in which the main routine is like a popular, major comedy, which you don't see me laughing at. How could I be sure that there is something here as funny as a video of the routine, \\"Who's on first?\\"  I still only see the questions, and the fact that Who's wife sometimes comes down and picks up his check for him doesn't make it any clearer to me.<br />This is not the first book by or about Jacques Derrida that I have tried to read.  An interview, \\"This Strange Institution Called Literature\\" (pp. 33-75) establishes that it is possible for the editor, Derek Attridge, and J.D. to talk to each other about literature and philosophy, though few people might be aware of what J.D. means by \\"Anamnesis would be risky here, because I'd like to escape my own stereotypes.\\"  (p. 34).  Forgetting about Nam (Nam amnesia?) might be risky for me, because I have so many things that I always consider Namlike in their stupidity to remind me, but J.D. was actually saying that recollecting his past would be risky.  Anyone who thinks ought to be able to escape his prior conditions or convictions, and it's much easier if no one remembers what they are.<br />There are only a few mentions of Nietzsche in this book, and the index says they are on pages 9, 26n, 34, 37, 39, 81, 287, 293, 326n, but I say they are on pp. 9, 26n, 35, 37, etc. and also in the title of the essay, \\"Rhetoric of Persuasion (Nietzsche)\\" by Paul de Man, and its conclusion:  \\"This by no means resolves the problem of the relationship between literature and philosophy in Nietzsche, but it at least establishes a somewhat more reliable point of `reference' from which to ask the question.\\"  (p. 327).<br />There is a chapter of this book on \\"Before the Law\\" by Kafka.  In addition to thoroughly explaining everything in that short work, there are a number of suggestions, like \\"Under these conditions literature can play the law, repeating it while diverting or circumventing it.\\"  (p. 216).  Those who are not familiar with Kafka might underestimate how much this book attempts to make the law seem less practical than Chapter 9 of THE TRIAL.  \\"This entire chapter is a prodigious scene of Talmudic exegesis, concerning `Before the Law,' between the priest and K.  It would take hours to study the grain of it, its ins and outs.\\"  (p. 217).  Then J.D. offers an explanation, but then starts talking about Prague and \\"my officially appointed lawyer told me: . . . `Don't take this too tragically, live it as a literary experience.'  And when I said that I had never seen the drugs that were supposed to have been discovered in my suitcase before the customs officers themselves saw them, the prosecutor replied:  `That's what all drug traffickers say.'\\"  (p. 218).  The priest is called, \\"a kind of Saint Paul, the Paul of the Epistle to the Romans who speaks according to the law, of the law and against the law.\\"  (p. 219).  Closer to the end, \\"'You are the prison chaplain,' said K.\\"  (p. 220).<br />Chapter 10, \\"From Shibboleth for Paul Celan\\" (pp. 370-413) is dated Seattle, 1984.  Much of the discussion is of the German words used in Celan's poems.  My favorite first line is of the poem, IN EINS, \\"Dreizehnter Feber.  Im Herzmund\\" which is translated:  \\"In One, Thirteenth of February.  In the heart's mouth\\"  (p. 397).  It appears again on page 399, with the second line, and a discussion of \\"Shibboleth, this word I have called Hebrew, is found, as you know, in a whole family of languages:  Phoenician, Judaeo-Aramaic, Syriac.  It is traversed by a multiplicity of meanings:  river, stream, ear of grain, olive-twig.

US	41560427	R2ZLLVEW5HZ9YU	1587430118	945020759	Darwin's God: Evolution and the Problem of Evil	Books	3	5	21	N	N	Start at the beginning	There are some technical terms which I needed to be informed about, so I couldn't skip around in this book as much as I expected to. The logic is as good at the beginning of the book as anywhere, with Milton and a few major philosophers showing up by page 14. Taking \\"For the eighteenth-century philosopher Immanuel Kant, our innate moral sense is sufficient to prove the existence of God,\\" (p. 14) as a starting point which will never be refuted, the scientific theory of evolution can still be seen metaphysically as an attempt to answer a question about the extent of God's nature and power.<br />On a very basic level, Darwin was able to make more sense out of the natural world, as it exists, by trying to understand a longer history than religion could provide for 7 days and 6,000 years. This book, DARWIN'S GOD by Cornelius G. Hunter, on evolution and the problem of evil, tries to make theodicy, (\\"Darwin's theory of evolution was very much a solution to the problem of evil,\\" p. 16) a metaphysics of a God who had been gone much longer than that, because \\"Darwin's gritty and chaotic world--the real world seen up close by naturalists--implied no such Creator. Creation was irrational, and therefore there was no such benevolent Creator, or at least not one who attended to details.\\" (p. 17).<br />Though opposition to Darwin is often seen as religious, for me it makes more sense to see it as political, like the political opposition with which complacency maintains its sentimental opposition to anarchy. One reason the American war in Vietnam lasted as long as it did was that the anti-war message was always more unpopular than the war itself. Radicals voicing outright opposition to American military policies represented a challenge to American status as a superpower in a way similar to the belief that God's power to reward every victor in any form of fight should not be called into question. Outrageous opinions of anarchists about pitiful, helpless giants who ought to bug out are found to be offensive, much as the grief of U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone's supporters at the time of his death was greatly increased by the lack of a popular alternative to militarism, and the unfortunate display of that grief as a political attack on those who considered themselves the equal of Paul Wellstone as U.S. Senators, but who might as well have been the antiChrist for those who don't like the way in which they use power to rule over their political enemies at home and abroad, hurt a few feelings.<br />Theologically, \\"After the sixteenth century, modernism had tended to view God as removed from creation, but Darwin was now increasing this separation to the point that the link between creation and God was severed.\\" (p. 17). But his ideas didn't actually prove the point. \\"The theory of evolution is true not because species obviously evolved from each other but because of the failure to reconcile God and nature.\\" (p. 47). \\"The evolutionist's notion of God and divine creation is, for many people, just a straw man--an overly simplified metaphysic that conveniently supports their views.\\" (p. 49). Anarchy as an ideal might also be considered an overly simplified metaphysic that conveniently supports the views of those who would be better off if they were not constantly being attacked by people that they do not consider anarchists. Politically, every stretch seems to come out of nowhere.<br />Modernity has arrived like the \\" `Cambrian Explosion,' the most spectacular of biology's big bangs. Estimated to have taken place almost 600 million years ago over a period no greater than five million years, it initiated virtually all the major designs of multicellular life with barely a trace of evolutionary history. In a geological moment, the fossil species went from small worm-like creatures and the like to a tremendous diversity of complex life forms, including all of today's modern designs.\\" (p. 69). It might have happened from holes in the ozone layer and an excess ofcarbon dioxide, for all we will ever know. \\"Geneticist Steve Jones wonders if the Cambrian Explosion reflects some crucial change in DNA,\\" (p. 70) which sounds more scientific than political to me. A fossil record begins with simple bacteria, \\"almost four billion years ago.\\" (p. 71). \\"Modern thinkers as disparate as John Wesley and Thomas Jefferson had agreed that their good God never would have allowed species to become extinct.\\" (p. 81). A book by Kenneth R. Miller written shortly before this one, and still more popular, called FINDING DARWIN'S GOD previously stated, \\"Nothing he designs is able to make it over the long term.\\" (p. 82).

The photograph on the cover was taken in May, 1882 and a portion of it (as shown on p. 132) appeared in her book with the caption, \\"Friedrich Nietzsche, formerly professor and now a wandering fugitive\\" (p. ix), as Nietzsche had described himself in a letter to the third person in the picture in 1879, \\"referring to the severance from his ten-year position at the University of Basel.\\"  (p. ix).  These people are all dead now.  When she was 20, Lou wrote a poem \\"To Sorrow\\" (pp. xlviii-xlix) which praises it as \\"the pedestal for our soul's greatness.\\"  (p. xlix).<br />Lou reported a conversation about the changes in his life in which Nietzsche raised the question, \\"When everything has taken its course--where does one run to then?\\" and told her, \\"In any case, the circle could be more plausible than a standing still.\\"  (p. 32).  She described his books as the product of \\"his last period of creativity, Nietzsche arrived at his mystical teaching of the eternal recurrence:  the picture of a circle--eternal change in an eternal recurrence--stands like a wondrous symbol and mysterious cypher over the entrance to his work.\\"  (p. 33).<br />This book does not have an index, and the notes on pages 160-8 merely clarify a few things, such as the date of the letter from Nietzsche to Lou at the beginning of Part III Nietzsche's \\"System\\" on page 91 which Lou used without the final comment, \\"be what you must be.\\"  The possibilities might not be considered so great.  \\"In that regard, if the sickliness of man is, so to speak, his normal condition or his specific human nature itself, and if the concepts of falling ill and of development are seen as almost identical, then we will naturally encounter again the already mentioned decadence at the culmination of a long cultural development.\\"  (p. 102).  The ascetic ideal \\"is also a third kind of decadence which threatens to make the described illness incurable and threatens the possibility of recovery.  And that form of decadence is embodied in a false interpretation of the world, an incorrect perception of life encouraged by that suffering and illness. . . . every kind of intellectualism extols thinking at the expense of life and supports the ideal of `truth' at the expense of a heightened sensation of living.\\"  (p. 103).  \\"In respect to Nietzsche's own psychic problem, it is of less interest to determine correctly the historicity of master morality and slave morality than it is to ascertain the fact that in man's evolution he has carried these contrasts, these antitheses, within himself and that he is the consequent sufferer of this conflict of instincts, embodying double valuations.\\"  (p. 113).  Ultimately, \\"Nietzsche's thought of the Dionysian orgy as the means for release of the emotions\\" (p. 127) are considered \\"the necessary conditions for the creative act out of which one shapes the luminous and godly.\\"  (p. 127).  Nietzsche and Schopenhauer are tied to \\"the deeply pessimistic nature of the Greeks because their innermost life, as revealed through the orgiastic, was one of darkness, pain, and chaos.\\"  (p. 127).  Art is the answer, here.  \\"The highest or the most religious art is the tragic because within it the artist delivers beauty from the terrifying.\\"  (p. 128).

Most of the chapters have a heavy philosophical theme, but lines of verse liven up Barth's analysis of Lessing's play, &quot;Nathan the Wise,&quot; the poems of Herder, and much of what Barth has to say about Novalis, who proclaimed, &quot;The secret path leads inwards.  Eternity with its worlds, the past and the future, is within us, or nowhere.&quot;  Most pages in this book which have footnotes start with a footnote number 1, and anyone flipping through pages might well forget where &quot;Frag., 593&quot; can be found.  An earlier review of this book has incorrect citations on David Friedrich Strauss.  Albert Schweitzer wrote about Strauss in his THE QUEST FOR THE HISTORICAL JESUS, a book which covered a topic on which Struass wrote three books with varying points of view and for different audiences.  The biography called D. FR. STRAUSS AND THE THEOLOGY OF HIS TIME was by Hausrath, who called him &quot;essentially a pathological figure.&quot;<br />The last page on Hegel provides the kind of contrast which makes a comparison of the two parts of this book imperative.  &quot;Theology had, and still has, no occasion to throw stones at Hegel, as if it had not trodden the same path as he, only not in so firm or so logical a manner as he did.  When we come to consider Schleiermacher we shall have to ask very seriously whether his secret is a different one from that of Hegel, only that with Hegel it might be a secret which was to a great extent more respectable and at all events more instructive than that of Schleiermacher.&quot;	2002-11-03

A lot of this book is thoroughly literary, with psychological insights.  Irony is not listed in the index, but addictions, alcoholism, depression, drugs, manic depression (bipolar syndrome), mental illness, overdose, paranoia, schizophrenia, Vietnam War, World War I, and World War II are listed as some of the mechanisms which were either meaningful to certain writers or a means of explaining their behavior.  Readers may pick other topics as their favorite parts of this book, with a few preferring the musical highlights relating to Adolph Hitler, Richard Wagner, and someone whose family was full of the suicidal tendencies of people who have problems adjusting to the world as it is.  The ultimate irony, for me, would be if this book demonstrates something about the fatal nature of truth, if each of the subjects can be shown to have known something that the rest of us have not figured out yet.<br />Those of us who are still alive have little reason to worry that our own mechanisms for clinging to life will be vividly portrayed in a book of this nature, but some people have official positions which call on them to interact with famous people in a way which this book cannot ignore.  In the case of William H. Webster, director of the F.B.I. in 1979, his contribution to this book was a public statement concerning a rumor printed on May 19, 1970, \\"Papa's said to be a rather prominent Black Panther,\\" (p. 335) about Jean Seberg, wife of Romain Gary, \\"but that the story had been broken independently by Haber shortly after the bureau had given the go-ahead to its Los Angeles division to disseminate the rumor.\\"  (p. 336).  Webster's statement, \\"The days when the FBI used derogatory information to combat advocates of unpopular causes have long since passed.  We are out of that business forever.\\"  (p. 336).  Recent news that Webster has been appointed to head an accounting oversight board, after leading an auditing committee at U.S. Technologies which fired an auditor who wanted to dwell on derogatory information, leaves us up in the air on who is capable of coming up with more derogatory information, and what people who have it are supposed to do with it.  Manic traits associated with such a situation include, \\"In conversation, she is a perpetual monologist, and ignores or disregards the interpolations of those about her.  If someone continues to interrupt or contradict her, she may fly into a fit of virulent rage.  Often she suffers from a persecution complex or else feels that she is surrounded by incompetents.\\"  (p. 435).

I was impressed by the dedication page: &quot;To My Uncles / Walter Seligsohn / who volunteered in 1914 and was shot off his horse on the Russian front in 1915 / . . .&quot; I was definitely not there, but that seemed to be a fantasy that is easier to put into practice than the idea of being a philosopher. In 1980, when I was sure that Walter Kaufmann thought he was a philosopher, but I was more interested in the history of thinking as bombing, I snuck up behind him and dumped a ton of bricks on his head. He shouldn't have been surprised, though, because it was his ton of bricks.<br />Things were tough, back in the 20th century, and the unsettling thing about this book is how well it avoids the psychological ploy of considering any individual totally insignificant in relation to questions about God.  Franz Kafka is the individual who raised the biggest questions about what this book was trying to say, as far as I was concerned, and he seemed to be impossible for Walter Kaufmann to dismiss after the confrontation in section 32, which Kafka begins by observing, &quot;Many complain that the words of the sages are always also mere parables, inapplicable in daily life, which is all we have got.&quot;  The philosophical analysis of Walter Kaufmann took Kafka's complaint to the usual logical extreme, and found, &quot;discourse that is ostensibly designed to elucidate them scientifically, while in fact its clarity is of the surface only, and on analysis it turns out to approximate double talk, is quite a different matter.&quot;  (p. 117).  In daily life, the question which keeps making an attitude about this kind of thing relevant is how well any individual can accept the acts of any authority as signs of pure benevolence.  In 2001, I haven't been too pure, myself, and I still have a copy of THE AMERICAN COLLEGE DICTIONARY (Random House, 1964) which informs me that in English history, a benevolence was once &quot;a forced contribution to the sovereign.&quot;  Anything funny about this kind of double talk is likely to get me started on crimes against humor, or Nietzsche having the audacity to suggest, in section 273 of BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, that certain people are condemned to comedy.  I would invite people to read this book with the kind of question that keeps cropping up in my mind:  Who are these people to tell me that there will be no more beating around the bush?vereign.&quot;  Anything funny about this kind of double talk is likely to get me started on crimes against humor, or Nietzsche having the audacity to suggest, in section 273 of BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, that certain people are condemned to comedy.

People who learned to diagram sentences and outline thoughts when they were in school might be interested in how this book is organized around, in, and through an outline.  Picking any particular topic, it is often surprising how well Karl Jaspers has placed it within a scheme of things.  Normally, there wouldn't be much reason to consider how a history of thinking as bombing might find a place in a book like General Psychotherapy, but at the moment, it is interesting that the following ideas in this book can be assigned to a particular place on a thread that runs through it, largely about the &quot;worlds of obsessional patients.&quot;  On page 390, in Chapter VI, MEANINGFUL CONNECTIONS AND THEIR SPECIFIC MECHANISMS, SECTION TWO, ABNORMAL MECHANISMS, 1.

I wouldn't want to be famous for criticizing people who keep attempting to describe reality, but who never get it right, if getting it right is still a concept that might have a particular meaning for a person who is fully aware of how often the view of Robert McNamara that &quot;We were wrong,&quot; has been more true than anyone but a fool would admit.  I'll be the fool in this, if I can do it in a way that exposes a vast exhibit of what is written in this book.<br />In an effort to construct a history of thinking as bombing, I looked for bombing in the index of this book, where it wasn't listed outright, and it wasn't listed as an entry under Cambodia, and there were no listings for Hanoi and Haiphong, but under Vietnam war, there were a few pages listed on \\"bombing halted in.\\"  Halting that bombing campaign was definitely one point where diplomacy was a major consideration, and most people will probably be glad that this book covers a few other topics, and leaves most of the history of bombing as thinking to those who are willing to be the disgruntled non-bombers of the world.  Kissinger even seemed a bit surprised that such 20th century events could turn the U.S. Congress into a bunch of non-bombers as soon as a ceasefire had been proclaimed:  \\"They treated the agreement as if it were the unilateral withdrawal they had always advocated.  In June 1973, the Congress denied further funding `to support directly or indirectly combat activities in or over Cambodia, Laos, North Vietnam and South Vietnam by United States forces' after August 15, including aerial reconnaissance.\\"  (p. 696)<br />Checking the index for euphemisms, I found an entry for \\"Rolling Thunder\\" campaign, an attempt which was so early in the war that it was thought that some justification might be required.  Page 658 tries to find something that might be a basis for that level of involvement without mentioning Pearl Harbor, but trying to get there anyway.  For a true intellectual, the important thing is how much thinking went into the planning of the activity, and Kissinger tries to give the guys as much credit as they deserve:<br />NcNamara's Defense Department and Bundy's White House staffs were gluttons for analysis.  Both were men of extraordinary intelligence.  What they lacked was criteria to assess a challenge so at variance with the American experience and American ideology.<br />  America's initial motivation in involving itself had been that the loss of Vietnam would lead to the collapse of noncommunist Asia and to Japan's accommodation to communism.  In terms of that analysis, in defending South Vietnam, America was fighting for itself, regardless of whether South Vietnam was democratic or could ever be made so.  Such an analysis, however, was too geopolitical and power-oriented for Americans, and was soon overtaken by Wilsonian idealism.  One administration after another had attempted a dual task, each part of which alone would have been difficult to achieve by itself:  the defeat of a guerrilla army with secure bases all around an extended periphery, and the democratization of a society with no tradition of pluralism.<br />  In the cauldron of Vietnam, America was to learn that there are limits to even the most sacrosanct beliefs, and was forced to come to terms with the gap which can arise between power and principle.  Precisely because America was reluctant to accept lessons so contrary to its historical experience, it also found cutting its losses extraordinarily difficult.  Thus the pain associated with both these frustrations was the result of its best not its worst qualities.  America's rejection of national interest as the basis of foreign policy had cast the country adrift on a sea of undifferentiated moralism.<br />  In August 1964, a presumed North Vietnamese attack on the cruiser Maddox led to an American retaliatory strike against North Vietnam that was endorsed nearly unanimously by the Senate via the so-called Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.  This resolution was used in turn to justify retaliatory air raids a few months earlier.  In February 1965, an attack on an American advisor's barracks in the Central Highland city of Pleiku triggered an American retaliatory raid on North Vietnam, which quickly turned into a systematic bombing campaign code-named \\"Rolling Thunder.\\"  By July 1965, American combat units were fully committed, and the American troop presence began to grow, reaching 543,000 by early 1969.<br />  --p. 658.<br />McNamara's book IN RETROSPECT denied that this sequence was as intentional as the opponents of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and those who were later upset by the direct involvement of American troops in Vietnam's war claimed, and Kissinger's sequence seems a bit out of whack when he described the process as, \\"This resolution was used in turn to justify retaliatory air raids a few months earlier,\\" but this might be a bad case of the truth trying to slip out (some kind of time-boggling confusion in the midst of so much confabulation).  Trying, like the fool that I am and was, to reach some conclusion by combining the words at the end of each paragraph on page 658 brings about the following startling revelation:  American experience and American ideology with no tradition of pluralism had cast the country adrift on a sea of undifferentiated moralism by early 1969.  This might be even truer today than when Kissinger wrote Diplomacy, which is his fairly long way of saying the same thing, I think.<br />There is some real history in this book, for which I am thankful.  I am quite fond of Kissinger's great praise of Bismarck's thinking, for having the kind of loyalty which \\"depended on flexibility and on the ability to exploit every available option without the constraint of ideology\\" (p. 125).  Particularly interesting for those who are interested in a detailed history of the way that observing events might affect philosophers was the way that Bismarck's craftiness gave Nietzsche the opportunity to observe a war between the great powers before he wrote his first book.  The realities of Nietzsche's times might have been very much as Kissinger put it in this book.  \\"In one of his craftier moves, Bismarck used Napoleon's posturing to lure him into declaring war on Prussia in 1870\\" (p. 118).  Prussia quickly won the war, \\"with the assistance of all the other German states\\" (p. 119) and used the occasion to unify the German states into a real Germany, \\"proclaimed rather tactlessly by the Prussian leadership on January 18, 1871, in the Hall of Mirrors of Versailles\\" (p. 119).  The method used by Bismarck to bring this about (what anyone should expect to find in a book by Henry Kissinger), \\"he leaked the so-called Ems Dispatch to the press\\" (p. 118).  Kissinger makes the French public, who were the ones who were the most outraged by what was revealed (\\"The edited version of the King's telegram looked like a royal snub of France\\" (p. 118)) appear to be the most upright and the biggest losers in that ordeal, if the damning of dignity might be considered an ordeal.  Sometimes comedy works the same way, but on a deeper level, this account also helped me understand the relationship between Friedrich Nietzsche, David Friedrich Strauss (who reacted with great pride in Germany), and public opinion in Germany during their lifetimes.  If only Kissinger had been leading a nation of Germans or the great British empire, he wouldn't have to deal with so many moralisms or the U.S. Congress.  He might have felt more at home if his main opponent had been Mahatma Gandhi..  This resolution was used in turn to justify retaliatory air raids a few months earlier.

I doubt if \\"Tfou, Tfou, Tfou\\" is a literal translation of \\"Il lui faut un homme providentiel.\\"  There appears to be more on each page in the English version than in the French, so it isn't too surprising that what I find on page 243 in the English version matches page 351 of the French, if \\"Il y a un monsieur qui nous suit\\" might mean \\"there's a furious little man following me.\\"<br />It bothers me a bit, that Romain Gary might have regretted something which he wrote in the original French, and was ashamed to have some tirade or ranting and raving translated into English, and those would be the parts that would be most mysterious to me, because I am such a novice in French, when I try to compare the translation with the original.  I envy people who can actually read French.  They could be the first to know what I am missing in this book.  If you can read French, buy the original, be it pulp or whatever.  You might end up knowing more than I do about this book, but I think I know what it means.to know what I am missing in this book.  If you can read French, buy the original, be it pulp or whatever.

The early Greeks were unsuccessful at learning to fly (except for Daedalus and Icarus, who are mentioned on page 22 as using wings to escape the maze of the Labyrinth of King Minos in Crete), so their capacity for strategic bombing was limited, but their thoughts were highly developed in other ways.  Among the early lyric poets, Archilochus may have been the most hypersexual in his forms of expression.  According to this book, \\"Archilochus was born, son of a slave woman, but one of the greatest lyric singers of Greece.  A soldier's fortune led him north to Thasos where, in a battle with the natives, he found his heels more valuable than his shield; he took to the one and abandoned the other, and lived to turn a merry quip about his fight.  Back in Paros he fell in love with Neobule, daughter of the rich Lycambes.  He describes her as a modest lass with tresses falling over her shoulders, and sighs, as so many centuries have sighed, `only to touch her hand.'  But Lycambes, admiring the poet's verses more than his income, put an end to the affair; whereupon Archilochus aimed at him and Neobule and her sister such barbs of satiric verse that all three of them, legend assures us, hanged themselves\\"  (p. 132).  Will Durant praises his \\"short and stinging lines of three feet; this was the `iambic trimeter' that would become the classic medium of Greek tragedy\\" (p. 132).  Archilochus was finally killed in a battle against the Naxians.  Most of this book is concerned with early artifacts of our culture, and the spiritual tradition which can be traced back to Archilochus seems to be particularly strong among people who would like to make a name for themselves in our modern world.	2001-10-09
