US	52987609	R2GVSZKK8IZBMB	0966825918	832039927	Road Dog	Books	5	2	3	N	Y	This is part of a column I wrote for Richmond Daily Register	You can read the complete column at [...] but I wrote the July 25, 2004 column about this book. <br /> <br /> <br />Glen Rogers, 'Road Dog\\" <br /> <br />Officer Krupke, you've done it again.  <br />This boy don't need a job, he needs a year in the pen. <br /> <br />-West Side Story <br /> <br /> <br />I just finished reading the book \\"Road Dog\\" (Federal Point Pub.) about the life of serial killer Glen Rogers.  The book was written by former Richmond Register writer Stephen Combs and Cincinnati Enquirer columnist John Eckberg. <br /> <br />It is a fascinating book and  especially interesting to people in this region. Rogers was captured in Madison County in 1995 at the end of a nationwide manhunt. He spent time in Richmond's jail.   Familiar names like Commonwealth's Attorney Tom Smith, Jailer Ron Devere, Judge Bill Jennings, Judge Bill Clouse and Attorney General (now Congressman) Ben Chandler are part of the story.  <br /> <br />The authors write about bureaucratic turf battles and mistakes that allowed Rogers to stay free and do his damage.   Rogers should have been stopped after his first known murder in Ohio but really Rogers should have been stopped very early.   Rogers was able to go through life  believing  that laws did not apply to him.  <br /> <br /> Rogers was a good looking, smooth talking guy.  Although he was constantly in trouble, he was able to avoid serious jail time with his personality and cunning.  <br /> <br />Since I have never had charm or good looks, I have always been envious of people who do. Sometimes, I wonder  if   charm  and good looks are actually a curse. Charming people  can believe they don't need to work as hard as other people.  They think they can turn on the charm and get out of every problem.   <br /> <br />When I started  my career in the financial planning business, I knew that my looks and charm were not going to get me anywhere, so I focused on education and knowledge. I was used to rejection.   It never bothered me when  people said  no as I had heard people say no in other aspects of my life. <br /> <br />I worked with a lot of polished and charming people whose careers failed.  They thought they could get by on charm but people put their money with someone they have confidence in, not someone they like. Investors kept turning down the charmers for better informed advisors.  <br /> <br />It was the first time in their lives these charming people  had ever had faced rejection  and they could not deal with it.  They got frustrated and quit.   If they had learned at a young age to overcome rejection with hard work and knowledge, they would have been better off.  <br /> <br />Rogers was a woman hater but he also knew his looks and personality would attract women to him.  Many of his murders occurred when he lured a woman back to his hotel room or developed a romantic relationship.  He knew he could use his charm to get what he wanted, be it good or evil. <br /> <br />I had a high school friend who spent years trying to lure women to go anywhere with him. He was not charming and rarely was successful.  The irony is that my  friend would have been  loving while Rogers brutally murdered the women he attracted.  <br /> <br />If Rogers had learned at a young age that he needed more than charm, he might have developed other talents. Since he went through life thinking laws did not apply to him, he broke bigger and bigger ones.  Now people are dead and he is on death row.  <br /> <br />A certain amount of self confidence is needed for people to be successful. Most entrepreneurs and successful business people are those who knew when to go against conventional wisdom and have the confidence to do it.   In  a way, they are going against the rules that society has dictated.  <br /> <br />While successful people make decisions after working hard and educating themselves, others like Rogers whose develop  confidence that is  not based on real  knowledge or hard work. Rogers  never developed any  skill beyond being able to talk his way in and out of trouble.    He lived from minute to minute and crossed the line to be a murderer.  <br /> <br />If he had learned some other skill besides his charm and looks, there might have been more people alive and one less Road Dog.  <br /> <br />Don McNay is President of McNay Settlement Group and a member of the National Association of Newspaper Columnists.

Instead, I found it to convey the research and knowledge of an esteemed academic in a book that is easy to read.<BR>The research is certainly strong; author Gene Phillips, a professor of English at Loyola University of Chicago, knows his stuff. However, I am more impressed with the way the book flows. It covers Coppola's work with just the right amount of detail.<BR>The book is biographical, but the focus is on Coppola's movies and how they were made. Phillips breaks the book into chronological chapters but also groups similar works together. He discusses all three chapters of the Godfather saga as a group, even though they stretch over a 20-year period, during which Coppola was making other movies.<BR>Phillips is obviously a fan of Coppola, but the book comes across as dispassionate and even-handed. It takes us through Coppola's youth, his education at the UCLA film school, and his work for Roger Corman, the king of the B movies.<BR>The book would be well worth the effort just to read Phillips' perspective on how Coppola turned Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather into a classic film trilogy. Coppola saw through some of the more graphic sex and violence in the novel and focused on the drama of the struggle of the family. Graphic scenes were certainly part of the movie, such as the famous horse-head-in-the-bed scene, but Coppola was able to weave the drama and story line of the book in the way that became a film classic.<BR>Coppola was savaged by critics for casting his daughter, Sofia Coppola, in a critical role in Godfather III, and Phillips explains that she was a last-minute replacement after Winona Ryder became ill.<BR>Phillips also examines Coppola's screenwriting, as well as his business dealings in Hollywood.<BR>Coppola won an Oscar as the screenwriter for Patton, in which he captured the eccentric general in a way fans and critics could appreciate.<BR>And while they were developing Apocalypse Now, Coppola and George Lucas, who had been very close, broke their friendship; Coppola finished the film that is now considered an American classic.<BR>Coppola's skill as a director was not always matched by his skill as a businessman, and his money woes included bankruptcy. One of Coppola's low-budget successes was The Outsiders, a movie about teen alienation that helped launch the careers of Tom Cruise, Rob Lowe and Patrick Swayze.<BR>Phillips notes that the Coppola legacy has been passed to the next generation. Sofia Coppola won an Oscar this year for writing Lost in Translation and was nominated for best director for the same film.<BR>A slight irritation is that Phillips injects himself into his book every 30 pages or so. In discussing Coppola's success in the wine business, Phillips writes \\"For myself, I chose a bottle of dark, dry Coppola claret.\\" So?<BR>But overall, Coppola's movies will be seen for generations to come, and the book Godfather is a good insight into those films and the man who made them.<BR> <BR>Don McNay is president of McNay Settlement Group in Richmond and is a weekly business columnist for the Richmond Daily Register.

It is part of a chapter in my book,  Wealth Without Wall Street, A Main Street Guide to Making Money.   As I note, this book was a road map and inspiration for me.    Don McNay    [...]    George Bernard Shaw said there are two tragedies in life: One is not to get your heart's desire. The other is to get it.    I learned during my first few years in business exactly what Shaw was talking about.    I hit it big at an early age. I started my business at 23, and by 29 I was one of the top producers nationally of mutual funds, annuity, and bond sales for the New York broker with whom I was affiliated.    I had achieved the highest levels in the Million Dollar Round Table. I had a huge house in an upscale, gated neighborhood, a red Mercedes Benz convertible, and a big, penthouse-style office on the top floor of one of Lexington's taller towers. I was featured in Forbes and Financial Planning.    One year later both my lawyer and accountant recommended that I file for bankruptcy. My net worth had plummeted far into the red, and banks were breathing down my neck. My business was still going strong, but I had gotten into a real estate deal that I didn't truly understand with people I didn't know well. And, it happened at a time when the real estate market suddenly turned south.    Initially, I had grown my business by reinvesting profits and being frugal. I had lived modestly and had no debt. I knew my business backward and forward and spent a ton of money educating myself and my staff.    Suddenly, my cash was drained by a sideline investment and the expensive lifestyle I had decided to adopt. I didn't have the money to properly reinvest in my business and in continuing education. My focus went from a long-term view to just getting through the day.    I made the classic mistake of a successful entrepreneur. I thought my first success meant that I would be successful at everything.I got away from the things that had gotten me to the top.    If you study the history of entrepreneurs, you'll see that many do what I did. Their initial idea works. They become successful but then get distracted with outside interests and start to lose the single-mindedness that made them a success. Some recognize their mistakes and regain their focus. Others do not and their businesses fail.    I was lucky. I was able to see what I did wrong and make corrections.    The year was painful, but I learned lessons I will never forget. The experience was as valuable as a Harvard MBA, and I paid more than the school's tuition to achieve it.    In order to get back on track, I had to go back to my roots like Rocky did in the movie Rocky III. I had to regain the \\"eye of the tiger.\\"    I thought long and hard about what I needed, what I wanted, and the mistakes I had made. I sat near the lighted, uphill waterfall in my massive house, looked at my beautiful car, and realized the house and car weren't important. The only creature comforts I needed were an ice maker, cable television (this was pre-Internet), a recliner, and air-conditioning.    What I really valued was financial independence and the challenge to be the best at what I did. I couldn't be independent if banks, creditors, and a fancy lifestyle controlled my life. A line in Bill Hybels' book, Christians in the Marketplace: Making Your Faith Work on the Job, hit me. It essentially said \\"if you spend all your time making money to support a material possession like a car, the car has replaced God in your life.\\" Or as the band Zoe Speaks said several years after Hybels, \\"If money's our God, I want a new religion.\\"    My religion had become keeping up my lifestyle and managing debt. Once I realized what I really valued -- financial independence -- it was easy to implement a different plan.    I ditched the big house and traded in the Mercedes for a Buick. I relocated my panoramic office to a small one on a ground floor.I sold most of the furniture in my home, except for the bed and recliner, and moved to a modest apartment that had air-conditioning, an ice maker, and cable.    I read and reread Pizza Tiger, the biography of Tom Monaghan, the founder of Domino's Pizza.    Monaghan's career path had the same sudden boom and sudden bust before he finally broke through to an international level. I couldn't afford to buy the book so I kept checking it out of the public library. (I own two copies of it now.) Monaghan's story gave me hope and inspiration.    I eventually knocked out my debt as I reinvested in my business and education. I got a second master's degree in financial services and my fourth professional designation.    Going back to the original formula got me on a growth path again. Four years after I ignored the advice to file bankruptcy, I was out of debt and my business was bigger than ever.    \\"Stick to what you know\\" seems like common-sense advice, but I have watched many business people make the same mistake I did. Once things start to go well, entrepreneurs think success will last forever. They often get into ventures outside of their expertise and start spending too much money and time on a fancy lifestyle.    When they crash, they do one of two things. They give up and quit or they \\"double down,\\" to use a gambling term, and focus harder on the original business. Like Monaghan did with Domino's Pizza. After he doubled down, his company reached success beyond his wildest dreams. He made millions, enough for him to buy the Detroit Tigers baseball team.    As I made my comeback, I used to play an obscure Jim Croce song, Age, every single day. Two lines were my mantra. \\"And now I'm in my second circle and I'm headed for the top, I've learned a lot of things along the way. I'll be careful while I'm climbing because it hurts a lot to drop.\\"    Some of the lessons I teach throughout my new book, Wealth Without Wall Street: A Main Street Guide to Making Money, such as movingyour money to a local bank and not having a boatload of debt, were learned through hard and painful experiences. Experiences I want others to avoid.    When people hit it big, they need to stick to what they know, live below their means, avoid credit cards and loans, and put some money away for a rainy day.    Otherwise the first act can be a final act.    Don McNay, CLU, ChFC, MSFS, CSSC of Richmond Kentucky is an award-winning financial columnist. He is the author of the book, Wealth Without Wall Street: A Main Street Guide to Making Money, which is currently available on the Kindle. The hardback copy will be released on September 20.    McNay founded McNay Settlement Group, a structured settlement and financial consulting firm, in 1983, and Kentucky Guardianship Administrators LLC in 2000.    McNay has Master's Degrees from Vanderbilt and the American College and is in the Hall of Distinguished Alumni of Eastern Kentucky University. McNay is a Quarter Century member of the Million Dollar Round Table and has four professional designations in the financial services.    What I wrote in 2002       I checked this book out of the public library at a time when my business was near failure. It gave me the spirit to keep on and have a sucessful turnaround. Monahan is a hell of a great story and it comes from the heart. An orphan, high school dropout who overcomes everything and becomes a billionaire. Only in America.     Not great literature and hard to find but well worth having. Now that I own my own copy, I will never give it up.     Pizza Tiger is a great motivating tool for anyone wanting to run their own business.    Don McNay...	2002-01-07

The best book ever written on the subject was Amy Domini's \\"The Challanges of Wealth\\" which was written in 1989. It did what what Sudden Money should. It really talks about what is important in any sudden money situation, the ability to control your emotions, know who to listen to avoid well meaning advice from family and \\"friends\\".<br />I am President of a company who assist injury victims with their finances and have 19 years of study on the Sudden Money topic. I was hoping Sudden Money would be something to give to staff and clients but it is not even close.<br /> There are two easy to read books that everyone from the secretary to the President of our organizations must read before they join us, A Piece of the Action by Joseph Nocera and the Millionaire Next Door by Tom Stanley. Nocera gives a history of personal finance and Stanley gives perspective as to why some people are wealthy and others are not. Read those and don't waste your money on Sudden Money.<br />The Sudden Money book does a good job of promoting what Bradley is selling, her seminars. There is not nearly enough detail of the emotional side of dealing with a settlement which is a LOT more important than picking the right products or advisor.<br />When it comes to picking the right products, Bradley shows she does not even know about even some basic techniques. In the whopping eight pages she devotes to insurance settlements ($200 billion a year is paid out in these settlements so it affects more people than discussing lottery winners) she does not even mention structured settlements, the most popular financial tool used on cases of $1,000,000 or more!<br /> It is a tax free spreadthrift concept that only injured people can receive. $5 billion a year goes into structured settlements and after 19 years experience and writing numerous academic articles on insurance settlements, I can say with certainity is the best way for injured people to avoid a lot of problems. Bradley apparently has never heard of the idea. Maybe someone should go to one of her seminars and tell her about what is REALLY going on in the financial planning world.<br />Bradley is media savvy and a great self promoter. I hope her book is not too successful as the last thiing a person with Sudden Money needs is poor advice.<br />Don McNay...est way for injured people to avoid a lot of problems.
