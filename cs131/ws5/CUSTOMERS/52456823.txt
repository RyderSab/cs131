Example: p586 described Trout River Pond as one of the most scenic places on the continent for stillwater kayaking. It wasn't. You had to go four miles for it to start getting good. While there was much better kayaking in the same park. In other places it missed the largest hotels and failed to warn that summer almost requires reservations. So does the unreliable ferry. Newfoundland was among the best places I ever explored but the free book from the provinces tourist bureau was much more valuable.	2004-08-06

The story gets a bit thin as he does not go into depth with the most important proofs, while he spends much more time creating a history of the Grail and the Templars. For the real story of Antonio and Nicolo Zeno story and the 1398 expedition there are better books to read. Sinclair somehow decided the Doge of Venice and the family Zeno should not have an &quot;O&quot; after their name. Once making this error - he sticks to it despite the fact that no one else has ever spelled it as ZEN. Leading this reader to wonder if a fact checker might have helped.	2004-06-01

Yes the people who took in the Oswalds prior to the assassination were connected to United Fruit, Cabots, Forbes, Dulles etc. But it doesn't mean anything, according to the author.

The author, however, decried the fact that only three such books on the Lincoln assassination were written by professional historians, the first 117 years after the murder. It is because the \\"pros\\" are afraid to uncover anything new. Even this book (which was great) fails to expose Booths connection to mason-like Knights of the Golden Circle, that kep the anti-Union, pro-slavery conspiracy alive well after 1865.	2002-02-18

Wilson and Flem-Ath cover quite a lot of ground in ten chapters, possibly too much. Some audacious points are made that have little or nothing to do with the conclusion of the book and may be unnecessary as well. One: Jesus was an Essene &#8211; Completely untrue as Essenes would have been horrified at Jesus taking company with tax collectors and women. Two: Jesus caused a riot and hoped a revolt would follow. Equally untrue. Jesus made a statement regarding the temple of God as a place of business and awaited arrest and death. Three: The body disappeared and the Resurrection story started. The Body was treated with aloe (a healing agent) and myrhh (a pain killer) which indicates his survival was expected, however the companions of Jesus knew he did not survive. The Resurrection is faith, and can not be proved or disproved in three pages. Fourth: The shroud of Turin depicts Molay(!) Several books on the Shroud (see Ian Wilson for the best) will testify that the Shroud is real. Molay was illiterate, and a scapegoat for the Templars who had seen the writing on the wall for years, and packed eighteen ships with men and treasure to escape the avarice of church and state. While Molay burned, Templar Inc. was back in business in Portugal, Scotland and what would become the country of Switzerland.<br />Despite the above, I remain a fan. A good book should always lead you to others and obviously a very impressive bibliography went into this work. Atlantis Blueprint offers enough to fill out a summer reading list.	2001-06-14

Moorehead describes convoys of 150 trucks, trains and wagonloads of Europe's artworks carried to and from Germany by avaricious politicians and soldiers alike. The damage done is enormous, but at some point, the description of the cost in human life in Berlin alone eclipses the loss of artworks. As a treasure story, it needs more.
