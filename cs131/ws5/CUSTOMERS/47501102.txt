US	47501102	R6JIA888JK5XO	0945707118	386996164	President James Buchanan: A Biography	Books	2	39	49	N	Y	Transparent Encomium	Writing a biography of man who was a very public failure cannot be an easy task--after spending so much time researching the man, you have to admire him, yet he may be deserving of little admiration.  This is the trap into which Klein falls in this book.<br /><br />The book provides a detailed and fairly interesting look at Buchanan's early and mid-career in Pennsylvania politics.  Klein sketches the state political battles that took Buchanan to Washington as a congressman and eventually to the presidency and has clearly read the correspondence by and about Buchanan well.  This strength prevented me from giving the book only a single star.<br /><br />Yet Klein has a vendetta against the \\"Black\\" Republicans, as he calls them; abolitionists; and Abraham Lincoln.  He defends Buchanan's every action in Bleeding Kansas, although he exacerbated a situation that Franklin Pierce had helped to create.  Every Pennsylvania politician who opposed Buchanan comes across as deceitful, while Buchanan is a paragon of honesty and principle.  But worst of all, Klein accepts Buchanan's every excuse for inaction during the four months after Lincoln's election and blames Lincoln, Seward, and others for the whole debacle instead of admitting that Buchanan was simply a weak and vacillating man in a situation that demanded decisive action and courage.<br /><br />Buchanan has probably gotten a bum rap for causing the Civil War, but he also was not the wonderful politician and president Klein makes him out to be.  However, the portrayal is so transparent that you can see the flaws in Buchanan despite the author's intentions.	2005-06-04

It's very useful if you need to learn how to diversify your workouts. <br /> <br />The book is very focused (thankfully).

If you just need to brush up or organize material that you sort of know already, Gleim is great.  But if you are starting from scratch or have no work experience in this area, Gleim would be a total waste of time and money. <br />  <br />Areas Gleim covered well & are on exam <br />1.  product costing (unit 2)--EUP, overhead allocation, service dept allocation, etc. <br />2.  joint products/common costs--the study questions teach you this, although the outline has little to say about it <br />3.  budgeting--calculating cash requirements for a specific time period, required purchases for inventory and production, calculate pro forma operating income given cash flow and vice versa, pro forma A/R, A/P, budgets & influencing management behavior <br />4.  direct materials & labor variances--explained well, nice diagrams on p. 342-43 <br />5.  responsibility centers <br />6.  performance evaluation--ROI, RI, EVA <br />7.  goal congruence--this is an important topic on the exam <br />  <br />Weaknesses of Gleim <br />1.  backflush costing (unit 2)--nothing useful in the book, use Horngren ch. 20 <br />2.  variable vs. absorption costing--Gleim covers the mechanics of this well, but it's hard to understand the theory from the book, and the theory is tested on the exam. <br />3.  fixed and variable overhead variances, sales variance--I studied and studied these variances and never figured them out, Horngren is only marginally better than Gleim on this one <br />4.  transfer pricing--use Horngren ch. 22 instead <br />5.  balanced scorecard--use Horngren ch. 13 instead <br />6.  behavioral issues--use Horngren ch. 21-23 <br />  <br />Don't waste your time <br />1.  Definitions (unit 1 in Gleim book)--Although the study questions for the unit are useful, the definitions material is a waste of time.  Most of them aren't covered on the exam, and the ones that are on the exam can't be understood from Gleim's definitions.  If you need to know it, it's covered in other Gleim units. <br />2.  Management Accounting Standards (unit 4)--Most of this chapter is useless.  Again, the study questions are good. <br />3.  CVP analysis--I don't believe it's on the LOS for exam 3 <br />4.  PERT & Gantt charts--Gleim itself says that you don't need to know this material--why did they put it in?  Pure sloppiness on Gleim's part. <br />  <br />There are fewer quantitative questions on this exam than on CFM-2, but there are 1-2 quantitative questions on every topic, so make sure you know them well. And know the theory behind budgeting, performance evaluation, variable vs. fixed costs, variable vs. absorption costing, and goal congruence because these are tested on the exam, yet Gleim does not cover the theory well.   <br />  <br />In my view, Gleim materials are a quickie cut-and-paste job--which may be perfect for some people, but they are not for everyone.	2005-04-30

Fillmore's dedication to the Union, especially in passing and implementing the Compromise of 1850, is well told.  This book also serves to explain the rise and fall of a number of lesser known American political parties. <br /> <br />The book is well-written--one of the better ones, perhaps the best, in this series of American political biographies.  It was one of the last written.  The author relies on letters to Fillmore as one of the main sources, since his own letters are mostly missing.  Generally the author is fair and balanced, although he portrays the struggle between Fillmore and Thurlow Weed rather naively as the battle between Good and Evil.  He also brushes over Fillmore's willingness to allow slavery to exist as the price for preserving the Union--an opinion that was common at the start of Fillmore's career but increasingly anathema by the end of it. <br /> <br />The review on the dust jacket, quoted on this item's Amazon page, written by Roy Nichols, is manifestly unfair to the book and to Fillmore.  The author is not nearly so naive as Nichols makes him out to be, and Fillmore, while not a great president, was not nearly the mediocrity and indecisive man as Nichols portrays him.  Read the book (it's worth it) but not the dust jacket!	2005-04-29

He is clear about Washington's failings, but he also is not embarrassed to discuss his amazing strength of character and great achievements. <br /> <br />On occasion one could tell that the book was condensed from a multi-volume work work as Flexner summarized points instead of relating things in detail.  Also, there are no footnotes and only a brief bibliographical essay, so one really can't tell where he got his information without going to the larger work.  But overall, it was a pleasure to read and very informative. <br /> <br />I would have liked to see more about Washington's faith, as it seems to have been very important to him.  Some authors talk about nothing but Washington's faith, which seems to me to miss the point of explaining the totality of his life and career. But  almost to ignore isn't good either. <br /> <br />Flexner does an excellent job explaining why Washington was so important to colonial and post-revolutionary America, which is what makes this book worth reading.  He also does a marvelous job showing how Washington learned from his mistakes and gained experience in politics and combat well into his 40s.	2005-04-17

He highlights several major trends in the country, illustrated by these politicians--the increasing opportunity for non-elites to rise to prominence in national politics, the change of the burning issue of the day from the tariff to slavery, and the increasing discipline and organization of political parties. <br /> <br />The story is compelling as he tells the lives of these men and their continued interactions in crisp prose that is guaranteed to improve your vocabulary.  His descriptions of the personalities, portraiture, and oratorical styles of the men are fascinating. <br /> <br />One question looms over the tale--if these were the three of the four most powerful politicians between Jefferson and Lincoln (Jackson would be the fourth), why did none of them get elected president?  Peterson answers the question by referring to their individual characters and to their public perceptions.  His last chapter and epilogue also contain an insightful discussion of the impact of each of the men on the looming Civil War and history's vindication or indictment of each for their roles (or lack thereof) in contributing to it. <br /> <br />This book is not an easy read, which is why I would have given this book a 4 1/2, if possible (yes, I'm stingy with 5's).  Another possible drawback is the limited discussion of the formation of the Whig party, in which all three played at least something of a role.	2005-04-17

I wonder if this book was just thrown together with material from the CMA part 2 exam. <br /> <br />Topics not in the learning outcome statements published by the IMA or the exam that Gleim covered include: <br /> <br />1.  accounting for leases, capital vs. operating leases <br />2.  accounting for bond premia and discounts <br />3.  deferred taxes <br />4.  accounting for derivatives/hedges <br />5.  pension liabilities <br />6.  accounting for issuing stock <br />7.  SEC regulations covered in much more detail by Gleim than on the exam or the LOS <br /> <br />Basically, you won't be asked to do make any accounting entries or understand any SFAS on this exam (except that you should know how stock dividends and splits are accounted for). <br /> <br />The Gleim material was also weak in its coverage of several areas that were on the exam: <br /> <br />1.  working capital--problems on A/R and cash management that Gleim did not cover <br />2.  stock and bond valuation--the exam had a number of types of problems regarding valuation based on dividend flow, changes in economic environment, etc. that Gleim did not mention <br />3.  employee benefit plans--Gleim has a bit on ERISA and a few other topics, but the exam coverage was much broader than the material in the book <br /> <br />Overall, the book was still useful, but keep the above issues in mind.  Don't waste your time on the first batch of issues and focus on really understanding the principles in the second area.  For employee benefit plans, you will probably need some additional material, although that should be a low priority since you only need to understand it a level A.	2005-04-17

Polk (The American Presidents Series)	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	Readable Intro to a Ambitious and Accomplished President	Seigenthaler writes a very readable account of Polk's life and presidency, something to be appreciated when reading the lives of the early 19th century presidents.  Sometimes his writing style and analysis tend to the journalistic (he is a journalist), but overall he is insightful and balanced.  Seigenthaler analyzes his presidency in terms of four goals that he set in his inaugural, all of which he accomplished. <br /> <br />Seigenthaler gives an interested picture of the Mexican-American War.  I had always assumed it was pure aggression on America's part, but Seigenthaler convincingly explains how it resulted from the Texas War for Independence, the Mexicans' brutal response at the Alamo, and the American desire for land.  Once Mexico attacked US forces, the US invaded and drove all the way to Mexico City.  Still not what I would like America to have been, but there was at least some provocation on the Mexican side as well. <br /> <br />The author does a good job describing Polk's ascension as a dark horse candidate to the presidency from being a defeated governor of Tennessee.  He also analyzes clearly his relationships with the other political powers of the day (Jackson, Van Buren, Buchanan, Cass, etc.).  Finally, he provides great insight into Polk's personality, his pettiness and vindicativeness, and his determination.	2005-03-27

But it is still quite readable.  As far as I know, it is the only non-juvenile biography of Harrison in print.<br /><br />The author has an excellent grasp of the details of Harrison's career as a general, governor of Indiana Territory, and Congressman.  There is not much to say, of course, about his month-long administration, except for the distribution of the spoils.<br /><br />The biggest weakness of the book is the author's tendency to view everything Harrison did in a positive light.  For example, Harrison made some major mistakes in his battles that cost lives, yet Cleaves glosses over these issues.  Clay and Harrison also seem not to have gotten along well, yet Clay is the one at fault, according to Cleaves.<br /><br />Cleaves also does not clearly explain the turning point in Harrison's career--at age 62 after having left Congress years earlier and while working as a lowly common court clerk to pay off his debts, he somehow became a presidential candidate in the campaign to succeed Jackson.  Cleaves attributes it to the widespread reprinting of a letter Harrison wrote defending his generalship during the War of 1812.  But he overlooks the question of why it was so widely reprinted.  Harrison must have had an organization to get the campaign going--I just can't see it as having been a \\"draft Harrison\\" campaign as he was so far from the political limelight.  A fascinating question that Cleaves left untouched.<br /><br />This book contains good material regarding relations with the Indians in the Northwest Territory.  Of course, it narrates a lot of tragedy and injustice, but it also gives a dynamic and somewhat sympathetic portrayal of the Indians with whom Harrison dealt.  Cleaves describes the different strategies the Indians adopted, ranging from unswerving alliance with the Britith to assimilation into white society.  Harrison comes across as sympathetic to the Indians but unwilling to rock the boat to protect them from injustice.  I was surprised by the Indians's varying strategies regarding land.  Some happily sold, others were pressured into it, and yet others fought to the death.  It's not a pretty story and something I'm not proud of as an American, but it's also not the simple story of the white man stealing the Indians' land.<br /><br />Finally, Cleaves says that Harrison died not as a result of a sickness contracted during his inaugural address but as a result of walks in the cold and slush about three weeks later (something Chitwood confirms in his Tyler bio).  This is the first time I have read this, but Cleaves has his point well documented.  It would be interesting to read an analysis of the origin of this discrepancy.<br /><br />Overall, this book is a good (and probably the only serious) bio of Harrison.  You won't really understand his personality or what drove him, but you will gain a good view of his career.  And the writing is fairly good as well.m injustice.

Although Monroe seems to have been a highly private person who never wrote about non-political subjects in his letters and left no diary, Ammon writes an amazingly complete review of his life.      Another strength of the book is how well Ammon covers the careers of the contenders for the presidency in 1825 (JQ Adams, Crawford, Clay, and Jackson).  Most authors tend to be biased in their writings on these polarizing figures, but Ammon is fair in his judgments.  He also goes beyond JQA's diary as a source for Crawford, which is a big plus since JQA loathed (probably with good reason) Crawford.    The writing is more scholarly than memorable, so it can be tough slogging at points.  Also, the book is sparse on analysis and interpretation.  It is subtitled \\"Quest for National Identity,\\" but I don't see that Ammon makes the case for how Monroe was involved in the creation of the American identity.  He is actually much more interested in Monroe's relations with the dying Federalist Party and how the four-way presidential election of 1825 affected Monroe's second term than he is with the formation of a national identity.    Overall, the book is well worth reading, but it's not an easy read and Ammon could have done better at relating the significance of Monroe.	2005-02-24

This is a broad brush biography--Silbey does paint the whole canvas, and he paints it well, but you won't find the exquisite (and sometimes excruciating) detail that most biographers give.   <br /> <br />Silbey is very good at relating Van Buren's life to the times he lived in.  By far the strong point of the book is the cogent analysis of Van Buren's life, why he took certain actions, and fitting it all into his life purpose of party formation.   <br /> <br />One question I had about the biography was whether Van Buren really did do nothing as president (which would have fit his political philosophy) or whether Silbey just narrated the events that had to do with party formation during his administration and that there just weren't many of them.  I suspect the former. <br /> <br />The book is well-written, although there aren't many of those memorable turns of phrases; but it certainly won't put you to sleep either.  A bit pricey, especially for the length.  Overall, a good book.	2005-02-16

There are two main themes in the book:  1) Jackson's transformation from a rash, angry orphan who kills in duels and executes his soldiers into a president of dignity, courage, and popularity; and 2) the \\"corrupt bargain\\" supposedly made between JQ Adams and Henry Clay in 1825 to deprive Jackson of the presidency, but which created popular anger that deprived Clay of the presidency and propelled the formation of the Democratic party out of the wreckage of the (Jeffersonian) Republican party. <br /> <br />Remini does an excellent job with the first theme, and I have come to have a grudging respect for a man whom I intensely disliked before I read this book because I learned how Jackson changed throughout his life.  Some (e.g. Joel Silbey) have called this biography \\"laudatory,\\" but I must disagree.  Remini is frank about Jackson's flaws--the consequences of his anger, the brutality of his Indian removal policy, his hypocritical slave ownership, his uninformed economic policies, his habit of weak appointments to office, etc.  But he also shows how this sad, angry kid became a great man and changed American politics from those of a republic to a democracy. <br /> <br />Remini was slightly less successful with the second theme.  He uncritically accepts the corrupt bargain as a fact, although at least Nagel's biography of JQA is more skeptical.  However, Remini does paint an interesting picture of how the supposed existence of the bargain did influence popular and elite opinion on many other issues during Jackson's career. <br /> <br />The writing is good but not great.  Remini covers a very colorful man, so the biography could have been more colorful.  At times it seems to drag when he covers the minutaie of legislative intrigue and cabinet politics.  But overall the book is interesting and well-written. <br /> <br />Recommended for understanding the era of transitionfrom the post-revolutionary era to the democratic, pre-Civil war era.	2005-01-22

He does an excellent job of teasing out connections between historical events and Shakespeare's works. <br /> <br />But he also assumes a good knowledge of Shakespeare's plays.  I've read a few of his plays, but I was often lost as he described the connection (without much background) between a character and a person in Shakespeare's life or history. <br /> <br />Greenblatt makes a lot of guesses (mostly intelligent ones in my opinion), but he is clear about where he is making assumptions and why. <br /> <br />Also, note that this is not a really a biography (more of a psycho-literary analysis), but given the lack of documentation about Shakespeare, it may not be possible to write more of a biography than what Greenblatt has done.	2005-01-11

The book is informative and well-written, but it tends toward overkill. <br /> <br />Ketcham provides thoughtful analysis of Madison's career and how it related to the writing of the Constitution and the formation of the nation.  In fact, his writing style is a bit unusual--he describes Madison's life from Madison's point of view, and you think that perhaps Ketcham agrees completely with Madison.  But then he concludes a section with an analytical summary, giving his judgment of Madison's actions; and some of his judgments are devastating.  The author was overall very fair to Madison. <br /> <br />Good book for getting an idea of Madison's role in the declining years of the Continental Congress, the Constitutional Convention, Federalist Papers, the application of the Constitution in the early years, the embargo, and the War of 1812. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book, but be prepared to slog through some sections.	2005-01-11

Ketchum's writing is lively and includes many personal vignettes.  Perhaps the outstanding feature of the book is that he includes the writings, decisions, and actions of the British and French figures, which are often ignored in the American perspective on the Revolution.  He also does well to convey the war weariness of America at this point and how nearly the Revolution did not succeed.  Finally, he continues the narrative to 1783 and does not end it at Yorktown, so you get an appreciation of the uncertainty after that battle and the two-year wait for the war actually to end. <br /> <br />One criticism is that the book contains a paucity of maps, so it is hard to follow the battles of the southern campaign (which the first half of the book covers).  Also, the guerilla warfare in the south is given short shrift, being covered from the perspective of Greene and Morgan, with only a paragraph devoted to Swamp Fox Marion.  Lastly, little is mentioned about the peace negotiations or the treaty and its implications. <br /> <br />Overall a very good read and informative.	2005-01-11

He discusses the failures of his presidency, notably the embargo of all trade, in a fair manner.  Finally, he provides an interesting analysis of the motivations and sources of Republican policy and places Jeffersonianism in its historical context in a much clearer way than I have ever read before.<br /><br />The book is well-written, although perhaps on the short side.

Little is written about Adams' personal or family life and the coverage of his participation in the Continental Congresses is also slim, apparently due to a lack of sources, since Adams destroyed most of his correspondence and Congressional deliberations were secret.  There are issues that I wished would have been discussed in more detail, e.g. the author has only a limited discussion of Adams' alleged role in replacing Washington as commander-in-chief (apparently a canard spread by his enemies). <br /> <br />The author explains well the development and sources of Adams' political philosophy and how it guided his actions before, during, and after the Revolution.   <br /> <br />The prose is well-written with many short quotations from Adams.  Overall, an informative and fairly interesting biography of a key and often overlooked figure of the American Revolution.	2004-11-29

Likewise, the analysis of the Civil War convincingly contradicted what I had learned about Grant and Lee's strategic abilities during college.  Weigley also wrote the first really good analysis of the strategy of World War II that I have read.  He discusses Jomini, Mahan, and others who influenced American military strategy. <br /> <br />The only gripe I have about the book is that the discussion of American strategy in a nuclear world got into too much detail of budgets and bureaucracy.  Also, the discussion of Vietnam is weak, but that can be excused since he did not have the advantage of highsight (the book being published in 1973).   <br /> <br />Overall an excellent and thought-provoking study of the evolution of American military strategy.	2004-11-27

Finally, he provides a list of recommended CDs to get a beginner started in building a collection. <br /> <br />One drawback--he spends almost no time analyzing the key elements of a particular composition or how the composer accomplished his purpose with his music.  Also, his prose, while beautiful, might be a bit flowery.	2004-08-31

He combines Mallory's journal entries, writings of Mallory's contemporaries, Messner's own analysis of events, and reconstructions of Mallory's thoughts and post-mortem reactions to trends in mountaineering.  <br />If you already know the history of Everest and the early British expeditions, this is an interesting book, as it discusses the context of Mallory and Everest.  Of course, you get Messner's views on the matter, but it seems to me that in such a book, he is entitled to do this.  If you want to know the history itself, read The Lost Explorer by C. Anker and D. Roberts or Everest by W. Unsworth (get the latest edition with many updates).<br />The writing/translation is crisp and interesting as well.	2004-05-18

It helps to have a basic knowledge of the doctrine of the millennium before you read the book as no one explains the basic views themselves.<br />Each of the contributors explains their view more or less competently, although Hoekema (amillennialism) has by far the most rigorous and well-organized essay.  Ladd's essay is also quite good.  Hoyt's essay is more about the dispesationalist scheme of Biblical interpretation, and he consistently confuses the concept of metaphorical or symbolic interpretation, arguing in his essay that such interpretation is &quot;literalism&quot; when any speaker of English would tell you that it is not.<br />Boettner's contribution (post-millennialism) was downright disappointing as he had no Biblical exegesis to back up his admittedly engaging presentation of his view.  Some of the responses by each contributor to the other's position are fairly rude, in particular Ladd, but also Hoyt to an extent.<br />The editor's careless work decreased the value of the book.  He did not require all the contributors to address their exegesis of key questions, like that of Rev. 20.  He allowed Boettner to get away with a sloppy essay that proved nothing.  And he allowed Hoyt to blather on and on in his essay and his responses about &quot;literalism,&quot; when any dictionary would show that literalism is not what Hoyt says it is.  <br />In summary, you can dig an understanding of the four views of the millennium out of this book, but the editor could have made it much easier.	2004-05-10
US	47501102	R2GW9XNPQ9BZGI	0664226345	485549746	The Meal Jesus Gave Us	Books	3	11	11	N	Y	Basic	Wright gives a very basic account of the meaning and purpose of the Lord's Supper.  I bought it expecting him to elaborate on the material in some of his other books regarding the meaning of the Lord's Supper.  However, this books is definitely intended for a non-scholarly audience.  If you want a basic explanation of the original meaning of the Lord's Supper and aren't concerned about the why's and wherefore's, this could be a good book for you.  He also gives suggestions about how the Lord's Supper should be celebrated today, based on his understanding of its original meaning.<br />If you want a more sophisticated discussion of the Lord's Supper, try Jesus and the Victory of God by Wright, where it is one of many topics.	2004-05-06

However, the author did not discuss his achievements and impact on American society in sufficient detail.  For example, there is only one brief chapter on his presidency, and it mostly is concerned with how JQA felt about the presidential campaign.  It says very little about his interactions with other politicians of the day or how great issues of the day, like slavery were dealt with during his administration.<br />I debated whether to give the book 3 or 4 stars, but I finally settled on 4 because the writing is interesting.	2004-05-06

His work is the definitive one, and his prose is interesting.  The pictures are outstanding.<br />A couple shortcomings that caused me to rate it a 4--first, his section on color coordination is far too brief, although he does give the principles or coordinating color with hair, skin, eyes, etc.  This is something that is usually overlooked in the mass of details on this subject in other fashion books.  Second, some key points are hidden in his eloquent sentences while they would be more accessible if they were bullet-pointed.  For example, I didn't realize that a dinner jacket should have one button, although I had read his section on the topic fairly carefully.	2004-05-06

I felt his views were more polemical and not so well founded on fact or research because he has only the barest of references to sources.  Lots of interesting ideas, but I'm not sure how far I can trust his analysis because he doesn't put them in the context of the intellectual debate on the topics he surveys..	2004-05-06

Especially interesting was his tracing of drama and music to its ancient Greek roots.  But the book really dragged at the end as he detailed the immoral and desperate personal lives of some of the modern creative geniuses.	2004-05-06

Lewis improved greatly on this type of writing	This volume collects a number of short essays written by Chesterton on social, religious, and moral topics.  For a number of them you need to know the background to a particular issue of his day in order to appreciate the essay.  In my view, C. S. Lewis did a much better job of writing short, pithy essays (e.g. God in the Dock) that have enduring value.  However, some of Chesterton's essays are memorable and make points of enduring value.	2004-05-06

It is very important to remember that the subtitle of the book is &quot;A Nightmare&quot; (missing from most covers) when you read it as this helps to interpret the book.  Chesterton added a note to some editions to emphasize this.	2004-05-06

His book is incredibly well researched and well-written.  While some of his conclusions are controversial, I definitely learned many interesting things.	2004-05-06

Especially helpful are discussions of how this field is different than that of Greek New Testament textual criticism.  <br />Note that this book is more of a manual for how to do textual criticism than it is a summary of the current state of knowledge in the field (although it does have a fair amount of that too).	2004-04-27

However, the writing style is poor since the book is FILLED with cliches.  Also the material is not well-organized with a lot of jumping from incident to incident.  Lots of fascinating inside stories, but disappointing overall.	2001-07-25
