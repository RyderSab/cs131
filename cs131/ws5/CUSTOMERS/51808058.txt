The book is sad in the sense that there are plenty of children out there whose lives this book mirrors. It's horrible to think there are parents out there like this. This book is a good read, not the highest quality writing, but entertaining nonetheless.	2002-03-21

The stories were borderline disturbing, but not too far off that they were hard to understand. The 2 girls/women led very intriguing lives &amp; sometimes you feel like a vouyer reading their stories. One thing I did not like was the fact that the book turned out to be only about one of the girls leaving you looking for more information on the other girl. I don't understand what the purpose of writing only 2 stories on one character were &amp; the remainder on the other. Definitely an interesting book that reads well.	2001-03-20

I have read many of the books in this genre (Bridget Jones, Girls Guide, etc.) and I expected this one to be just as good. It was not even close. The characters are boring &amp; there is not any great character development. The writing style was poor &amp; makes me wonder how this book was even published. The ending was extremely unfulfilling &amp; I could care less what happened to the &quot;heroine&quot; of the story. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! It is a complete waste of time.	2001-03-04

It was enjoyable enough for me to read it in only a few short days and actually look forward to it. I thought the character's &quot;weaknesses&quot; were true to form to those experiencing divorce. I also thought her over spending was not as unrealistic as other reviewers. It was a coping mechanism &amp; I think the author was very good at showing how this woman coped whether they were healthy or unhealthy ways. The biggest downfall was the lack of a time frame, therefore making things less genuine. It is hard to understand with all that happens if it is realistic when a time frame was not specified.	2000-09-27
