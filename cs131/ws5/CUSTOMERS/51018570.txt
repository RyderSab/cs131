I was hooked from the first chapter. The characters and situations are completely believable. I wonder how Wolfe, in his white suit, managed to research the prison underground subculture that Conrad encounters. Still, it is true that the Stoicism angle is a bit far-fetched and the ending is hurried. Substitute Christianity for Stoicism, as suggested by another reviewer here, and it makes a bit more sense.	2005-07-25

I devoured this book, it's an interesting, quick and fun read. Initially I was convinced the author had conveyed some brilliant insights, and my life was changed. A few days later, though, I kind of think that his insights are interesting, yes, and thought-provoking. But not really much more than common sense would lead any intelligent person to conclude.  <br /> <br />Still, I do recommend it as an interesting book.	2005-06-09

But while this book definitely has some interesting points to make, it does get bogged down quite a bit in the very specific minutiae of the hitory of brain study. This story would make an excellent magazine article, but I think it suffers in full-length book form, and ends up being a bit too long and even (in parts) dull for the general reader.	2005-05-08

This one looks across Carter's entire life, though, and recounts some particularly memorable occasions he spent, well, sharing good times with friends. <br /> <br />I have to admit, though, that as a fan and admirer of Carter I did find it interesting to learn that he is an avid outdoorsman and hiker well into his later years. He has climbed to Everest base camp in his 60's and climbed Mount Fuji in his 70's. He's not above using the perks of his reputation to get a private tour of a world-famous museum that's closed for renovations, or to get a private nature tour in between overseeing third-world elections. In fact, the man requires that he get a tour from a licensed naturalist every place his visits while doing business for the Carter Center. <br /> <br />You might see the man as egocentric and maybe a bit daffy; I know many folks do. But I found myself dreaming that I was part of his inner circle, and hoping to imitate him in my own later years. I give it an objective three star rating, but add a star if you are a fellow Carter admirer.	2005-05-07

Well, keep em coming, becuase this was a thoroughly enjoyable read. It introduced me to a whole world of amateur adventurer-explorers, one which I knew next to nothing about. The prose is a bit hyperbolic, but it's definitely an enjoyable, informative, highly readable story.

The deprivations and hardships of Riley's crew make for fascinating reading, and the odds of their survival -- never mind making it back to civilization -- are truly extreme. Riley is a highly intelligent, loyal, and sensitive captain, and he gambles a risky deal to save his life and his crew. <br /> <br />And the author has clearly done his research, determining many details of locations that Riley has visited. Between the research and the surviving first-hand accounts, many extraordinary details of the journey survive, making this a rich story indeed. The book also offers a number of interesting anthropological and social insights into Arab culture ca. 1815, much of which we are told remains unchanged today. <br /> <br />Weaknesses? Well, the book is not particularly well-written. It's not *poorly* written, but the author does not have the style or flair that might make this a truly outstanding book. Finally, the names of many of the Arab characters are confusingly similar. Not the author's fault, to be sure, but a minor problem for the reader. <br /> <br />In this election year, I did take away from this book one small insight. Perhaps the well-known \\"liberal\\" bent of the New England seacoast states stems, in part, from generations of well-traveled seaman like Riley, who experienced firsthand the cultures of the world and made contacts with people from many nations.	2004-09-12

That in itself is not bad, except that most of the topics are mundane, trivial, and done better elsewhere. There's an essay on silly warnings on products, for example; another about how confusing tax forms are. The format works better when Bryson writes about culture clash, but too much of the time he comes off as a second-rate Andy Rooney.<br />The other problem -- and this one is more serious -- is that the tone is so tongue-in-cheek, and the humor so exaggerated, that the reader never knows if Bryson is telling us an outrageous fact or if he just made something up. For example, he says \\"in the entire history of commercial aviation no life has been saved by the provision of a life vest.\\" Extremely interesting if true ... but is it?<br />Bryson's prodigious writing talents are much more effective when applied to serious scientific and cultural matters. \\"A Walk in the Woods,\\" \\"A History of Everything,\\" and \\"In A Sunburned Country\\" are all well-researched books where the information is factual, and the humor is used to get the point across.

However, Bryson goes further in that he explores all the major branches of science -- geology, biology, physics, paleontology, etc -- in his direct and easily-understandable way. Bryson is a highly readable author, and he is a wonderful companion here. He tells the story of these sciences from a historical standpoint -- how we came to understand the world -- and takes us right to the present day. The bibliography is immense, the research painstaking, and he has obviously spoken to a number of current researchers in their fields.<br />In short, if it's been a while since you went to High School, you would do worse than to pick up this book for a highly readable refresher.<br />Another Amazon reviewer does make a good point. Bryson enjoys recounting science's &quot;dead ends&quot; -- perhaps dozens of stories of discoveries and beliefs that were held for decades, or centuries, that turned out to be completely wrong. Yet he accepts much of today's scientific dogma quite uncritically. As for me, I came away from the book wondering what aspects of our current scientific knowledge may also be dead wrong. If the history of science tells us anything, it should be that we don't really know everything we think we do.	2004-04-05

He comes across as kind of a Victorian professor, a tone which is perfect for some of his other works such as &quot;The Professor and the Madman&quot; and his history of the Oxford English Dictionary. However, I don't think his style works for the subject matter at hand here. I doubt there is another recent work of natural history which contains more instances of the words &quot;splendid&quot; and &quot;delightful.&quot; Winchester never met a tangent that he didn't find fascinating, and again, while that approach works with other subject matter, it is distracting here.	2004-03-08

When the men are adrift with minimal food for weeks, he uses WWII-era experiments to speculate what probably happened to the men's physiology and psychology. He interviews contemporary whale experts to evaluate the likelihood of the reputed whale behavior. <br />Overall, a great story well-told and well-researched, and deserving of the National Book Award.

The book lends particular focus on how the Haywood and Christian families \\"spun\\" the tale after the fact to make the mutineers seem more \\"noble\\" and Bligh more \\"evil\\". As far as I can tell, it's a straight-up, honest and well-researched account of what really happened.<br />However, it does seem to me that the book spends proportionally too much time on the court martial and Peter Haywood's family and life, and not enough on the events onboard ship or on Pitcairn Island; I suppose this reflects the amount of material available on each. Further, the author assumes an understanding of geography and nautical terms that could be explicated by a glossary and more (and better placed) maps. And the narrative is quite jumpy, at least at first, going back and forth in time, when a straightforward approach would probably serve the reader better.	2004-02-17

You'll be reaching for your own dictionary more than once as you read this book.<br />Of course, this is entirely appropriate considering the subject matter. Winchester could practically be &quot;channeling&quot; Professor Murray himself. The book is full of heavily researched footnotes and asides. More than once I imagined it must have taken the author a week to get the facts for a single tangential sentence. <br />But it all goes down easy thanks to his good sense of humor.

In a single day he might have a meeting about a test ban treaty, then one on Vietnam, then a phone conversation with Martin Luther King on civil rights; squeeze in a quick meeting with high school students in-between (including young Bill Clinton), and cap it off at the end of the day with a hot bath for his back and a secret liason with a mistress.	2003-02-11

The book would be helped by an amusing sidekick, or at least a more interesting part of the world to visit. That said, it's still a pretty good -- and short -- travelogue of Australia and its people.	2003-01-05

Horwitz offers sharp insights on a region of the world which remains an unknown to so many of us in the US. Author Horwitz brings out the contradictions and the humanity of the Middle East.	2003-01-05

Not a biography of Captain Cook, it is a compelling hybrid of two genres: travelogue and history. It's informative and interesting, while managing to maintain a light touch and breezy style. Not unline Bill Bryson's \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" in its mix of humor and serious observation. One other similarity is the presence of the quirky friend. The quirky, hard-drinking, church-avoiding Roger provides comic relief and genuine insights which occasionally escape Horwitz. <br />My main complaint with the book was that I wish Horwitz was a photographer as well as journalist; I wanted to see the places that he visited.	2002-12-08

There are no three-dimensional characters, and nobody learns anything or changes. <br />Nanny annoyed me for her spinelessness. Advice, Nanny: most of your problems could be solved if she would just act in a more businesslike way. If you want your clients to treat you like a professional, then act like one. Set clear terms for the job and stick to them. Set a per-diem fee in advance for the Nantucket trip and stick by it. And don't be afraid to walk away if the employers balk.<br />Um, back to the book. As a fun way to spend your weekend, you could do worse. In truth, I could not put this book down, it was a wonderful distraction from *ahem* taking care of my own kids over a long Thanksgiving weekend. Add a star if you take care of young children, or if you love to poke fun at the foibles of rich people.	2002-12-02

Just a simple day at the beach for a little girl and her father, while mom stays home with the baby. It just so happens that this simple story mirrors our own family's summer activities, and we love to turn to this book again and again. Plus it's small and easy for little hands to hold.	2002-11-16

I picked up this book figuring that there must be some positive reforms that came out of the Confederacy, but as Davis tells it, the founders were selfish hypocritical rationalizers. The Confederacy really was all about instituting a class of aristocrats to rule over the poor whites and oppressing the blacks. The book is at its best when it deals with race issues, and the incredible lengths Confederates would go to justify their \\"peculiar institution\\". Despite their protests to the contrary, ultimately the South was fighting for principles that were unworkable, untenable, and even immoral, and so their cause was doomed from the start.	2002-11-11

Obviously they are well-loved and have stood the test of time. But on closer inspection, the stories are kind of weak. The 11 girls who have the misfortune of not being Madeline are nameless, dialog-less, characterless ciphers -- for six books! Pepito changes overnight from an animal-abusing brat to a saint? And the christmas story is just plain stupid.<br />But like the illustrations, in the end the stories are examples of how sloppy and messy can work. The cadences of the text are wonderful. And my 3-year-old daughter loves the books. Who am I to complain?	2002-08-28

Of particular note are the opening chapters (a preamble offering a concise history of the Senate itself) and the closing chapters (on the historic first Civil Rights bill). Caro manages to make clear and interesting, all manner of political maneuvering. I will never think of the Senate -- or American politics -- the same way again.

However, after being blown away by &quot;The Power Broker,&quot; I finally decided I had to read Caro's other magnum opus.<br />Turns out that, like &quot;The Power Broker,&quot; this volume is researched in thorough detail, and written with great style. The book paints its subjects -- Texas before the depression, the nature of powerful men -- with the broadest possible brush, so that the book is not just about Lyndon Johnson; it's about our country, our system of government. Definitely a worthwhile read.	2002-07-29

However, as it turns out, the central episode of this book (LBJ's 1948 Senate race against Coke Stevenson) is well deserving of a full-length treatment. The book stands on its own as a story of a remarkable election -- and the pivotal election in LBJ's career. And, like Caro's other books, it's researched to the point of obsessiveness and written in a compelling, brilliant style. In particular, the introduction is a masterful summary of the is a masterful summary of the hopes, fears, and expectations of the country as it looked toward its president during the civil rights era. I can't wait to read volume 3!	2002-07-29

It's quite well-researched, as the author attempts to \\"debunk\\" a lot of conventional wisdom about Elizabeth's formative years, and it's well-written, very much like a novel.

Although I loved the first volume of Morris' Roosevelt biography, this one leaves me flat. I think it's because the story of the &quot;making&quot; of Roosevelt is just so much more compelling than his years in office. Like any politician, TR must lose his bluster and bravado and become ... an administrator, dealing with sensitive political matters large and small.

The book as a whole is kind of like the pictures in it: occasionally interesting, but fall short of being really beautiful because they're rendered in poor-quality black-and-white printing.	2001-10-21

This book has an unbelievable amount of information for the lighthouse enthusiast. Each lighthouse of maine is given from one to three pages each, with up to 10 photos of each light, plus a map, brief history, directions how to get there, how to get a water view, etc. This is undoubtedly overkill for most people, but invaluable for the true enthusiast. My only gripe: the graphic design is uninspired, and most photos are only 2x3 or so. Perhaps fewer, larger photos would have been better.	2001-10-21

She tells you history, lots of photos, maps, directions how to get there and how to photograph them.<br />The book's main flaw is that is graphic design is rather weak.

The entertainers profiled are not nearly as odd as claimed. The guy who could produce any scrap of paper named by the audience? The guy who could maneuver a ball up a ramp while curled within? The man who stretches his body a few inches? They sound interesting, but there's not much more to the book than is evident in the sentences you just read. <br />Jay seems to have done his research through advertising and printed materials, rather than first-person sources, and this means his stories rely on conjecture where there should be depth and soul.	2001-10-16

However, be aware that although this guide claims to include &quot;nearly 200 peaks,&quot; it does not include every little mountain in Maine (a very big state).

The stories are generally along the lines of &quot;my cat sat on Andropov's lap&quot; or &quot;my cat ate from KGB trash cans.&quot; And more of the same.

Well, I think it's the only book ever written about the AMC's high huts in the White Mountains. And it is quite informative and useful if you plan to do a lot of hut hikes. The maps and short hike info definitely enhanced my hut trip.<br />But I would rather see something a little less blandly &quot;official&quot; and a little more &quot;behind the scenes.&quot; I'd have appreciated more anecdotes about what goes on during those long summer days when the hut crews have spare time. I know that the crews famously play pranks on each other. And surely the advent of &quot;co-ed&quot; crews has resulted in some, eh, hanky panky?

This is not one of those books on how to do crazy effects, rather it's a tool for serious users to get the most from Photoshop's tools. This book takes you through each of the different features of Photoshop -- sharpening, color correction, making selections -- and teaches you things you thought you already knew. <br />P.S. Years after writing this review, and attending Photoshop workshops, I can attest that the information in this book holds up. The advice on topics such as color correction, making selections, sharpening, etc are still on-the-money and totally applicable to Photoshop 7, so if you can get this book at a big discount it may well be worthwhile.	2001-09-10

Lots of humorous anecdotes mixed with serious asides about the AT, natural science, bears, trees, and more. If you're a hiker, or love the outdoors this is a must-read. The first half of the book in particular is sharply written and unforgettable. The 2nd half, well, is something of a disappointment ... but still mostly sharp.

Most have no more detail than a newspaper clipping, which is generally their source. As anything more than a way to pass the time, this collection is worthless.<br />But as time-passers go, you could do a lot worse. I found myself barely able to put the book down as I scanned entries, hoping and expecting that the next tale would be more interesting than the stupid one I just read. I was rewarded just enough to keep me coming back for more. This book is in the tradition of those odd &quot;Best worst and most unusual&quot; and &quot;Panati's beginnings/endings of things&quot; that kept me up late nights during my early teen years.	2001-09-10

Time and again the author dispels this reader's preconceptions of living conditions, race relations, and rural life in general. Told in a breezy, chatty format (a little confusing at times, since it's not strictly chronological), this book is a terriffic read, with choice anecdotes spread throughout.<br />If you're a suburban guy like me, this book is almost a document of life on another planet.

Franklin is truly one of the great figures in American history. However, BF's achievements are buried under a pedantic writing style.

Robert Moses, the man who did not know how to drive, kills public transportation in NY to build the modern auto-centered city. <br />This book is a fascinating portrait of a fascinating and hugely influential man.

However, this one's not one of his best. The plot takes a long time to get going, and the characters are so pathetic, or so unsavory, that I was left with a bad taste in my mouth.<br />In White's defense, probably a real-life covert operation would be 75% research and 25% excitement. However, this ratio does not work well in a book. The hero spends too much time doing his research at home, and only the last quarter of the book rescuing the troubled victim. And the ending -- depressing and pointless.	2000-10-09

Give it 4.5 stars.<br />Good Points: 1) The author points out &quot;kid-friendly&quot; features on hikes and gives good descriptions.  2) Most of the hikes have pretty good thumbnail maps<br />Drawbacks: 1) Introductory map could be better (more detailed) to help reader find trails 2) Some hikes lack thumbnail maps. Why? 3) Abilities of children vary wildly. We found that a &quot;moderate&quot; hike can be strenuous for an inexperienced or out-of-shape child (or adult, for that matter).	2000-10-01
US	51018570	R2DUJZX6YQ0UKU	1878239929	459054603	Discover Acadia National Park: A Guide to the Best Hiking, Biking, and Paddling	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Good but many flaws	This book does offer lots of informative descriptions of many hiking trails, bike rides, and paddling trips in Acadia. It describes not only selected carriage roads, but also some often-overlooked fire roads and other dirt roads. And the map which comes with it is, like all AMC maps, outstanding; it is even printed on waterproof, tear-proof tyvek. However, I would like to point out quite a few flaws of this book:<br />1) The book is overly large to carry with you on a hike<BR>2) Confusing verbal descriptions of trail locations can be difficult to locate on the included map. Ideally, each trip should contain a thumbnail map, or at least be coded to the central map. <BR>3) Long verbal descriptions should be condensed into a cue sheet for each trip. Although the park is well marked, presumably the point of buying the book is to follow a route suggested by the author. <BR>4) A little more subjectivity wouldn't hurt. The book has lots of information but could use some more opinion. Again, the point of buying a book is to get a viewpoint from an &quot;expert.&quot;<BR>5) The book is by no means &quot;comprehensive&quot;. &quot;Comprehensive&quot; means &quot;every trail in the park.&quot; This book is selective, not comprehensive.	2000-10-01

Includes: camping info, hike descriptions, suggested snowshoe and ski routes, and close-up maps of many of the most popular hiking trails. Also includes a large fold-out map of entire White Mountains region on waterproof, unrippable stock. Lots of illustrations, and an attractive and useful design.<br />I found that this book is quite under-rated by local booksellers. This is an excellent book for a casual White Mtns hiker who wants an abridged guide to the more popular day trails, with concise and clear information about each (including trail times, estimated difficulty, and short description of each). This is the guidebook that I use most often for day hikes; and in a lot of cases I find this map more useful than the AMC map series. For example, the colors are much more clear, and numerous scenic points are marked, although water sources are not.	2000-10-01

What it adds up to is a highly useful and convenient guide; to paraphrase the beer commercial, it's the field guide to bring when you just want to bring one!<br />Still, if you're specifically into birds or mammals or trees only, you'd be better off getting the field guide for that specific genre, as this guide won't have enough detailed info for you.	2000-10-01

The maps are clear, the cue sheets are concise, and the descriptions are informative but brief. Distances of the rides vary from 8 - 20 miles or so, and are largely well-chosen. And the book is small enough to take with you.<br />When I lived on Long Island I did several of these rides and was not disappointed.	2000-10-01

The story is compelling: man climbs the ladder of sports success only to be stricken with life-threatening disease. Man  fights disease and returns to greater success. <br />The prose manages to  remain true to Lance's he-man attitude, but is also quite readable. The  first chapter alone is a stunner. Definitely should be on your summer book  list.	2000-06-07

Didn't cover the world of placement agencies, for example.<br />Much of the info was for  illustrators, it seemed.	2000-06-07

But this one's a winner for its clever illustrative style and seamless technique.<br />This little board  book is the perfect size for little hands. The photo/illustration montages  are visually witty and brilliantly executed. And how can this book be so  inexpensive? A winner all around.	2000-04-07

She loves the picture on the cover, and she loves putting her finger through the little holes. We parents like the  cautionary tale of not over-indulging our appetites.<br />This is one of our  favorite books for beginning readers, and I think it's Eric Carle's finest.	2000-04-07
US	51018570	R179UBTPY9506H	0786882697	726758333	Kink: An Autobiography	Books	3	1	3	N	N	funny ha-ha, or just ... funny	Although presented as an \\"outrageous\\" true story of a rock-and-roll party-animal, this book is best viewed as a cautionary tale of how unfettered drugs, sex and money can turn a poor boy into an irresponsible, paranoid, delusional madman. Toward the end of the book, Davies finds \\"redemption\\" in the occult, believes he's inhabited by alien conciousnesses, can't maintain a caring relationship with anyone (least of all brother Ray), and is generally spoiled and self-centered. What a jerk! <br />Perhaps unsurprisingly, he seems blissfully unaware that his \\"bad behavior\\" over the years could have affected anyone other than himself. This proves to be the books fatal flaw, for at least if Davies displayed some genuine self-examination this book would be more than just a self-serving batch of excuses. But Davies offers no genuine insight into the rock-and-roll mindset, and seems quite incapable of it. Still, there's some moderately interesting gossip here, even if Davies lacks the courage to name the worst offenders. And some of the more over-the-top bits are quite funny, if unintentionally so.	2000-03-18

The characterizations and settings are dead-on believable and often quite fascinating. However, not much happens in the book (much like life, I guess), no  beginning-middle-end. Worst of all, the final chapter feels tacked-on, a  false attempt to bring the story to a big conclusion that doesn't ring  true.	2000-02-16

(Is that 4 requirements?) Almost all of the recipes in this book meet those. <br />This  is the cookbook that I use the most. The pages are covered with spills,  tearing, falling out. That's the mark of a fine cookbook. Maybe it's time  for me to buy another copy.	1999-12-01

No tales of break-ins or derring-do here, but rather hours spent behind a magnifying glass  creating documents. The most exciting cases here involve exfiltrating spies  and others from behind unfriendly territory. This usuallly involves making  a mask for them and walking through an airport. In fact, there's about 3  tales of making masks and walking through airports ... and the author can't  tell you the details of the masking technique, because it's secret. <br />I  can't help but think that any CIA spook who did see REAL adventure couldn't  tell about it anyway because it would be classified. So this is the best  we'll get. I'll stick with John LeCarre.	1999-11-29
