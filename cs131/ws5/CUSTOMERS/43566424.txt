It had an absolutely great storyline, but the story itself wasn't her best told. Although Three Fates is wildy incredible in every aspects, the rushness of it was not easy to follow, and the dialogues seemed different from Nora. Hope Chesapeake Blue is going to good.	2002-07-03

This fourteen short stories book of Stephen King's is a definite winner among his fans and anyone who likes good ole' short, scary, dark, and humorous stories.<br />One of my favorites of the book is &quot;1408,&quot; in which a writer, whose specialty is disproving of haunted places, daringly enters a &quot;supposedly&quot; haunted hotel room. The owner urges him not to, and the man stubbornly refuses. When he does enter the room, he finds it more than haunted... he finds more than he ever wanted to.<br />&quot;Autopsy Room Four&quot; is a darkly humorous tale of... well, autopsy. I won't say much of it, since it'll probably spoil the story, but I'll that is it reminicent to that of Poe's &quot;The Premature Burial.&quot;<br />Like one reviewer said, though, the masterpiece of this collection is &quot;Lunch at the Gotham Café.&quot; It's about a maitre d' gone mad, and it's my favorite so far.<br />EVERTHING'S EVENTUAL is an absolutely excellent collection of King's last fourteen short stories, and says that King should publish short stories more often. It'll hit the bestsellers' list in no time.	2002-03-29

I won't get into that, but the story isn't as bad as it sounds. It reads rather easily, but the second bad thing in the story is the grammar. The Cottage - and previous Steel novels - have so much comma splices in it, it's enough to last someone a lifetime counting them.	2002-03-16

After reading 2nd Chance, I wanted more of Patterson. Second Chance tells the story of the Women's Murder Club for their second round of mystery. In it, Lindsay, Cindy, Claire, and Jill must work together the clues to find their seemingly racist killer - with the risking of their lives. Patterson wrote a refreshing story after the suffocating Violets Are Blue; 2nd Chance will hit the bestseller lists in no time.	2002-03-08

And once again, they encounter the last person they always would want to see - Count Olaf.  The Baudelaires must suffer through the unfortunes once again with the help from the Quagmire triplets.

On the bout of thinking each other dead, both move on with life, though they still love each other.  Claire believed Jamie to be dead at Battle of Culloden until a friend of hers proved otherwise.  With new knowledge that Jamie might have survived the battle, Claire must choose between her present life and her life with Jamie...<br />Voyager again captures all emotions felt in Dragonfly in Amber and Outlander and Claire and Jamie's love for each other is more real than ever.  Gabaldon also interweaves adventure, history, suspense, even humor into this wonderful tale.  Voyager was a great read!	2002-01-31

This one just had a little something that was missing.  I tried reading it from a newcomer's point of view, and I didn't recall many descriptions that will help newcomers to be easily acquainted with Cross.  The ending wasn't even surprising or thrilling as it should be...  I gave this a four star because it was such an easy read and it was thrilling at many other points in the story.  I recommend this to any Cross fans, but I have to say it certainly isn't Cross's best tale.  I hope Patterson will &quot;kick it up a notch!&quot; with the next Alex Cross story...	2001-12-07

Stephano, the uncle's &quot;new assistant&quot;, comes to the house only to make the children's lives miserable as it already was.<br />With some humor and many unfortunate events, Lemony Snicket creates a fun story to read and will make you want to read the other books in the series!	2001-12-03

It's a funny, easy-reading book that is compared to as a modern \\"A Christmas Carol.\\"  Like A Painted House, he's skipped courtroom thrillers.  I hope he does it again.

Vince Everett enters her life with an eviction notice, leaving her and her brother homeless.  Everett allows the Ascot to stay at his home, and things run amok from there.<br />Like I said, this isn't a really good novel, nor is it bad, but Lindsey makes me happy enough to want to read her upcoming, The Pursuit.	2001-11-12

US	43566424	R4XGZLFPPCK2A	0385335377	224196833	Lone Eagle	Books	3	1	2	N	N	same old, same old	This is one of those stories where you just can't take it anymore!  Danielle Steel has the tendency to repeat little things in her stories, but in here, she overdoes it, and it became a headache for me -- took me two weeks just to read.  Anyway, I gave it three stories because the story itself was excellent -- yes, I know she's formulaic, but I like her stories.  I hope THE KISS will be like JOURNEY or LEAP OF FAITH.	2001-07-08

EB was my first from Jayne Ann Krentz, and i was completely impressed.  i read DAWN IN ECLIPSE BAY in due time but it lacked a little something-something.  i dunno.  i know i won't give up on jayne, but i hope the last ECLIPSE BAY book live up to the first.	2001-07-08

This is my second tale from the Queen of Suspense--the other was the dragging STILLWATCH.  Unlike STILLWATCH, ON THE STREET WHERE YOU LIVE is amazing--so suspenseful.  I definitely look forward to her upcoming works and BEFORE I SAY GOOD-BYE.  Mary Higgins Clark is now one of my favorite authors--can I even say that if I only read two of her novels?	2001-07-08

It was entertaining, funny at times, and of course, outrageous.  The only thing that's bad about her novel is the it is poorly edited -- and I mean VERY!  I am looking forward to Jackie Collins novels -- except the Santangelos.	2001-07-08

I enjoyed this book a lot -- I'm saying this on my age level, though I very much prefer adult novels [James Patterson, Jackie Collins, Amy Tan, etc.].  It was entertaining in a sweet way, but the relation of mother and daughter was WAY, WAY too close.  But I'm looking forward to what Lynne and Britney can cook up next.	2001-07-08

SUMMER LIGHT is a first from Luanne Rice for me, and I am certainly looking forward to her upcoming releases--and FIREFLY BEACH.  Luanne Rice's tale is heartwarming and has the realism of the real-life.  I love it.  Luanne tops Danielle Steel.	2001-07-05

I always looked at a Janet Evanovich cover and think, this must be one of those bland female mysteries.  Then one day, I met a fanatic of Evanovich who introduced me to the series, and I swear, I laugh and laughed.  Stephanie is not the heroines where you want to marry, but rather one that you'd want a bottle of beer and and movie with.	2001-06-24

After the disappointment of LONE EAGLE, I nearly gave up on Danielle Steel, but when I finished LEAP OF FAITH, it gave me a LEAP OF FAITH for her buying her upcoming books.<br />Marie-Ange Hawkins had a princess life in a chateau in France, but an event one day took her royal-like life away from her, becoming a Cinderella story.  She is taken to the Iowa, where her great grandmother lives and takes Marie-Ange in.  There Marie-Ange befriends Billy Parker, a red-headed, freckled boy; their friendship grows into one like that of brothers and sisters.  Years later, she receives a chance to return to France, leaving behind her terrible farm-life-and her best friend.  But she is lucky to find another man who befriends her like Billy did...<br />Hmm...  Danielle Steel's short novels tend to be good, in my opinion, and this is no exception.	2001-06-14

In this tale, he weaves together four women to form the Women Murder Club. They try to solve a case in which a killer is on the loose--killing newlyweds! As the the page turn, so does the twists and turns. It was baffling and very detailed--graphic, but nice kills--but it is worth it. James Patterson is the master of suspense writing--even if it means crossing. This is his best along with ROSES ARE RED and CAT AND MOUSE. Cannot wait for VIOLETS ARE BLUE, 2ND CHANCE, and his upcoming romance SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICHOLAS.	2001-06-14
