It is especially great for beginning gardeners who are often confused with the large variety of plants profiled in general gardening guides. The plants profiled here are wise choices for AL and MS although some will perform better in the northern areas of the state and vice-versa.<br /><br />There are 186 tried and true individual plants featured, organized in sections of \\"Annuals,\\" \\"Bulbs,\\" \\"Groundcovers,\\" \\"Herbs,\\" \\"Ornamental Grasses,\\" \\"Perennials,\\" \\"Roses,\\" \\"Shrubs,\\" \\"Trees,\\" \\"Vines,\\" and \\"Water and Bog Plants.

Chapters in the back of the book include \\"The Low Maintenance Lawn,\\" \\"General Pest Control,\\" \\"Landscaping with Native Plants,\\" \\"Plants to Attract Butterflies and Hummingbirds,\\" \\"Landscape Tips for Winter Months.\\"<br /><br />This is a guide that can ease the pain of choosing plants appropriate for the area for beginning gardeners and experienced gardeners will appreciate the practical advice of caring for the plant. I would hope that future editions would include even more plants (there are some that are mysteriously absent) - that would make this an invaluable reference indeed!	2005-10-03

I think a product such as this is hard to review because I suspect that a remedy that works for some people won't necessarily work for others. That said, I will relate what the cd did for me. I go through frequent phases where I cannot get to sleep easily, sometimes lying awake for hours with my mind constantly working. Other times, I awaken hours before I'm ready to and have difficulties getting back to sleep.<br /><br />The instructions on using this cd recommend that you listen to it while you are awake and not when you are ready for bed. I did this only one time during the day. Since then, I've listened to it with a portable cd player with headphones after I get in bed on nights that I suspect that I will have problems going to sleep. Each time, I fall asleep way before the cd ends but I'm always able to wake up and turn the player off and then go back to sleep. I've noticed that I always sleep my entire 7-8 hours without interruption and I awaken fully relaxed and refreshed. Since listening to the cd each night for one week, I stopped using it and I've slept well since. On the occassional night when I don't feel sleepy at bedtime, I listen to it again and I'm asleep within 20 minutes.<br /><br />Now I'm thinking about trying the author's hypnosis cd that helps you to remember!	2005-10-03

For those who already have shade, the author shows how you can have a fabulous garden using a variety of plants that provide dramatic leaf structure and some that even flower. Of course not all shade is the same and the various types of shade are explained. Some typical problems concerning shade gardening, such as dry shade or excessive moist shade, is discussed as well. Over 300 plants are profiled individually in the last half of the book. For gardeners who want more shade, a list of shade trees and shrubs is provided. Most helpful is a section of shade garden designs based on various themes (Victorian, Japanese, Native, etc.).	2005-09-30

Each section of plants is categorized by size (Large, medium and small) and then by color of the bloom. A color photo of each plant is provided as well as a brief description, size, exposure needs, zone, etc. A page number reference refers to a more in depth description of the plant in the back of the book.<br /><br />Beautiful and plentiful photos, thick glossy pages and a wealth of information make this a reference that you can browse for hours.

Their photographic library consists of over 10,000 images - this book presents 200 of them, beginning with the formal bedding gardens of Victorian England and progressing through the Arts and Crafts gardens of the Edwardian era as well as modernist gardens, artists gardens, wild gardens and cottage gardens. The emphasis is on the Arts and Crafts gardens and the influence that Gertrude Jeckyll and Edward Lutyens had on garden design. An entire chapter is devoted to Jeckyll - other chapters cover landscape architects who were influenced by Jeckyll and Lutyens, the popularity of borders, Sissinghurst and Hidcote, the Modernist Garden, Romance and Restraint (following World War II), From Smart to Art (Artist's Gardens) and the final chapter \\"Making it Over\\" which discusses how some of the major estate gardens have been saved and restored. The prose is very interesting and informative (although the author can be very opinionated) but the highlight of the book are the remarkable photographs. Most of them are black and white with the exception of a few duotones (of Jeckyll's gardens) and color photos in the last chapter. The book is beautiful, printed on heavy glossy paper and any garden lover will love it.	2005-09-10

Wilde's  witty plays and daring novels (\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\") elevated him as a darling and \\"dandy\\" of  Victorian society for a brief period of time  before his arrogance and brazen homosexuality brought his career to a screeching halt and sent him to prison. Wilde discovered that he was gay late in life and despite his marriage to Constance Lloyd, he made up for lost time with a succession of \\"rent boys,\\" and acquaintances from the Uranian Society. The author quotes extensively from the letters of Wilde, his lovers, contemporaries and friends to exhaustively trace his wanton ways. What is most remarkable about this book is that it not only paints a vivid portrait of Wilde but the other characters in his life are not glossed over. As compelling as Wilde are also the stories of his unhappy wife Constance, the great love of his life Bosie (Lord Alfred Douglas), Bosie's brother Drumlanrig and his doomed relationship with Lord Archibald Rosebery, Wilde's devoted friend (and former lover) Robbie Ross, and Bosie's vile father, Lord Queensberry, who brought about Wilde's downfall. The author also paints a vivid portrait of Victorian life and shows how Wilde's actions were a shock to the antiquated mores of the time. Gay audiences would be wise to read this book to gain an appreciation of Oscar Wilde's noble stance as well as be thankful that the attitudes of the world are at least not as bad as they were then.	2005-09-02

The history and folklore of the plants are discussed with particular attention to their hallucinogenic and medicinal qualities (both plants are poisonous). Classification of the plants are illustrated in detailed charts that show flower shapes, fruits, measurements of flowers, and basically everything (and more) than you would ever need to know. Other chapters cover cultivation, propagation, building a collection, natural changes (in brugmansia) and diseases and pests. The accompanying color photographs are excellent with amble close-ups and many full plant shots. Highly recommended for anyone interested in these outstanding and exotic plants.	2005-09-01

However, it doesn't compare with some of their earlier books (notably, \\"Quest for the Rose,\\" which is one of the best books of its kind ever published). This one profiles over 850 roses from over 20 classes including the recent David Austin English roses, Romantica roses and Generosa roses. Each rose is given a description and \\"garden notes\\" which discusses hardiness and growth characteristics in the garden. Most all are illustrated with nice color photos (typically, many are close-ups - what is so wonderful about \\"Quest for the Rose\\" is how the photographs show their complete size so you can get an indea of how they grow in the garden). Most of the roses are photographed in their natural habitat but about half are photographed against white backgrounds. A concluding section, \\"Roses in the Garden\\" showcases ten pages of mouth-watering photos of roses growing among other plants, on garden walls, etc.) A glossary and brief tips on rose care are included as well.<br /><br />I think the book is very nice and I can't think of better qualified experts on the rose. That said, I do think the book has some limitations. First of all, I don't like the way the roses are arranged. Each chapter covers a specific type of rose (i.e. \\"Hybrid Musk,\\" \\"Floribunda,\\" \\"Bourbon,\\" etc.) and about 10 roses are profiled on a two-page facing spread alphabetically. When you turn the page, the roses on the next two pages are presented alphabetically starting over again at \\"A\\". The roses seem to be arranged by color but by not presenting the entire chapter alphabetically, it makes it harder to locate a specific rose. Of course, there is an index, but I still don't care for the layout. A few photos also seem to be mislabeled (\\"Georgetown Tea\\" for example).<br /><br />The major limitation of the this book is that it doesn't discuss how the roses grow in various climates. Since the authors are British, I'm sure they selected roses that do fine in England, so gardeners in other climates might need a better selection guide (like the American Rose Society Encyclopedia for example).m sure they selected roses that do fine in England, so gardeners in other climates might need a better selection guide (like the American Rose Society Encyclopedia for example).	2005-08-29

Sweet uses a variety of techniques to achieve these works of art but many of them are achieved with multiple exposures, slide sandwiches, filters and camera movements. Technical info, like types of lenses used and f-stop settings are also provided. In addition to technical tricks, Sweet also shows how he approaches positioning an object in the frame to achieve certain effects as well as achieving the best results with color contrasts.

The distinct characteristics of the hummingbird - their size, description (differences between the male and female), courtship, flight, sounds are covered in detail. Most interesting are chapters that cover an average day in the life of the male hummingbird and the nesting habits of the female (the author describes her own month long observation of one in a park near her home). Other chapters cover the fascinating migration, banding projects and how to attract hummingbirds to your garden.	2005-08-02

There is no doubt that Kostova is a talented writer and her descriptive prose easily renders the appropriate atmosphere. The first half of the novel almost reads like a travelogue as the lead character and his daughter travel throughout Europe. However, this 600+ extravaganza requires the utmost patience from the reader and I'm guessing that many will abandon the book in frustration. It starts out promisingly but then gets bogged down in the middle and doesn't pick back up until the last 60 or so pages. This is where the needed suspense finally kicks in but it is really too late and the ultimate show-down is anti-climatic. If you like long and detailed novels, exotic locales and beautifully rendered prose with a rich sense of history and geography, I would highly recommend it. But don't expect a fast-paced and suspensful thriller. The story is not as scary as I'd preferred and it will be interesting to see what Hollywood does with the film version.	2005-07-19

The author explains the usual dilemmas with film, cameras, composition, etc. but also includes very good information about labeling, storing and organizing your work (a link is included for a software program that I was not aware of - thank you!).<br /><br />I bought this book mainly, however, for learning more about taking nature photos with a digital camera. While the author raves about the digital format and even confesses that he uses digital for most of his work now, there are only 2 photos in the entire book (out of hundreds) taken with a digital camera. This is a little disappointing and kind of puzzling. I would have liked to know more about the specifics for using digital photos for publication.	2005-06-27

The herbs are profiled in an A-Z format (from alfafa to willow) and  each entry presents a thumbnail sketch which covers common uses, active constituents, adverse effects, cautions and contraindications, drug interactions, and doses. This is followed by more in depth information covering the description, parts of the plant used, traditional use and current medicinal use and a lengthy analysis of the scientific research that has been conducted on the particular herb. This latter section is referenced and the source materials can be found in the back of the book.  The authors, who are licensed pharmacists, are also objective in their statements so the reader is sometimes provided with conflicting research and can make informed decisions. A handy list located in the front of the book, \\"Medicinal Herbs for  Health Conditions\\" allows the reader to see in a glance which herbs can be used for particular ailments. This is an excellent reference source for healthcare professionals.

Overall, I have to say that With No One as Witness is a pretty satisfying read but I do have a few complaints. First of all, the book is entirely too long - 627 pages! I appreciate the fully developed characters but enough is enough. The best place for editing, in my opinion, would be the plodding aspects of the inner strife within the police department. Boring beyond belief and it brings the narrative to a screeching halt every time. And we know by now that the author loves the English colloquially but it seems that she throws it in every chance she gets and it seems contrived.<br /><br />Aside from these quibbles, if you can stick with it, this is, at times, a very good read with suspenseful sequences, a very vile serial killer and a daring plot development that is extremely sad. I just have one challenge to Ms. George - can you write a novel that is under 400 pages???	2005-06-23

This A-Z encyclopedia includes over 1100 names from today and yester-year. Each entry includes a head shot and a brief career analysis followed by a list of film credits. Since there is no index of any kind to look up actors by type or film title, you mainly have to browse the photos if you are searching for a particular individual whose name you don't know. Also if you are looking for detailed biographical information about the actor, you might be disappointed. However, since any biographical information is often hard to find about these actors, this is a book worth having in your film library.	2005-06-02

First of all, soil, the basic foundation of any good garden is covered - how to identify your soil type, how to improve it, digging, using mulch, adding ammendments, using green manures and improving drainage. A chapter on compost covers everything you need to know - what can be composted (some of the things listed may surprise you!), how to compost, building a bin, differences between hot and cold composts and making worm bins. A chapter titled \\"Time and Space\\" covers the actual planting of the garden - saving seeds, planting seeds, crop rotation, perennial vegetables, growing in beds or containers, fertilizing, harvesting and storage. The final sections of the book deal with weeds and controlling pests. Charts, diagrams, checklists are included. Very easy to follow and good basic information on going organic!	2005-06-01

There may be more than usual but not enough to detract from the quality of the cookbook. More photos of the dishes would have been more helpful. There are indeed maybe too many photos of lemons, cheese, utensils, etc. This is a beautifully designed book, the art direction is top notch, but I can't find that it detracts from the quality of the recipes presented.	2005-05-31

He also remembers some of the most memorable gardens he has visted.<br /><br />Subsequent chapters describe the different types of roses (species, old roses, modern roses, climbing roses, ramblers and scramblers, etc.) The last section of the book is an encyclopedic directory of roses mentioned in the book.

Allen Smith is back and he is still wearing that blue shirt and khaki pants but at least his ideas for container gardening are more colorful. His second book pretty much follows the same format as his first - glossy pages in front and a section of thick paper pages in back. As with the first, the photographs are outstanding.<br /><br />This is a book of \\"recipes\\" for putting together beautiful color-coordinated containers with contrasting foliage. Some of the containers are more beautiful than the plants themselves and may prompt many readers to start shopping for their planters at antique sales. Each recipe spells out the ingredients - the type container and number and quantity of each plant. A photo and list of tips are also included.<br /><br />The latter section of the book is quite informative and contains articles on stocking a potting shed (hmmm, the first item is a copy of his Garden Home Journal), selecting the right container for the setting, how to \\"age\\" a container, clean terra-cotta pots, waterproof containers, plant a standard pot, a hanging basket and a window box, and a plant directory of all the plants he mentions in the book.<br /><br />It is quite obvious that these gorgeous containers were put together with plants fresh from the nursery (or florist) and I question how some of them would look after the growing season kicks in. For example, he recommends using the rose \\"La Marne\\" in one arrangement and even though he is using a large container, I know that this rose gets quite large and I'm not sure how it would look surrounded by coleus and petunias!?! The same goes for other plants like Kopper King hibiscus, etc. Still, I'm sure a lot of it is trial and error and if you want a book to inspire, this one will surely do it.	2005-04-12

Each entry includes the address, a brief sentence or two about their career and fame followed by a paragraph about the house itself and a black and white photo. The photos are usually good although there are some that are very small and others in which you can only see a fence or a driveway. The captions note that some of the stars only lived in the houses for a few years. You might be surprised at how modest a lot of the homes are! An appendix gives \\"movie star homes by region\\" and \\"theme tours.\\" If you are taking a trip to Hollywood, you will definately want to take this book with you, and it is a fun book to browse even if you are not going there.	2005-02-28

From the opening photo of producer Buddy Adler's Oscar sitting on the shelf of a hat rack at Romanoff's Restaurant to the final now famous photo of Faye Dunaway sitting by her pool the morning after she won her award, this is a very special book. It is filled of course with great photos of the winners themselves but also contains other interesting mementos, like ticket stubs, seating programs, invitations, dinner menus, sample ballots, telegrams, memos, etc. Also photos of Hollywood landmarks, like Ciro's, Ambassador Hotel, Biltmore Bowl, Beverly Hills Hilton and the Beverly Hills Hotel are included. Most of the early celebrity photos were taken at the banquets and formal dinner celebrations and it is funny seeing all these people smoking and surrounded by liquor bottles on the tables. The book is in chronological order and the photos near the end of the book (from previous years parties) are smaller but much more numerous. The captions that accompany the photos are fantastic - they are not mere snippets but interesting lengthy paragraphs full of fascinating information. Included throughout the book are sketches and essays written by F. Scott Fitzgerald and quotes from the columns of Louella Parsons and Hedda Harper. An afterword by Dominick Dunne and a list of winners, year-by-year compelte this fascinating book.	2005-01-17

It is thus exciting to see a brand new biography published in 2004. This 500+ tome is probably the most detailed ever but most of the information here focuses on her career and works. Every play and film is analyzed in minute detail. This is so much a \\"career biography\\" that the wild antics and hilarious persona of the woman herself often seems to be hiding in the background and we never get a sense of this fascinating woman's personality. Although I admire the research that went into this book, I cannot say that it was a \\"fun\\" read and not nearly as entertaining as Lee Israel's 70s biography \\"Miss Tallulah Bankhead\\". Also, as other reviewers have noted, only a handful of photos are included.	2004-12-29

He apparently had a photographic memory and he recorded the details of his life in vivid detail, recalling not only physical descriptions but verbatim dialog as well. When he wasn't working, he was usually on extended vacations, traveling to exotic locales as the guest of the rich and famous. Although he is often suffering from poor health, he presses on and never fails to write in an entertaining fashion, branding everyone he comes in contact with his witty and bitchy style but nevertheless, offering an illuminating analysis of their character as well.<br /><br />Among the celebrities dissed here are Greta Garbo - he and several others spent a two week cruise with her - but the unhappy Garbo was apparently determined to make everyone as miserable as she was.  Truman Capote, a good friend of Beatons', enjoying immense success after the publication of \\"In Cold Blood,\\" which contributes to his downward spiral with drugs. Most surprising is his assessment of Katharine Hepburn. The last pages of the page detail his tormented experiences on the set of the musical \\"Coco,\\" starring Hepburn, who, in his opinion, wasn't concerned with anyone or anything but herself. Other celebrities getting wide attention is Mick Jagger, Picasso, Princess Grace, David Warner, Laurence Olivier and many many more.<br /><br />If anything aside from the gossip, the diaries show how demanding and stressful the life of showbiz really is.	2004-12-22

The letters span 46 years with the majority of them from the late 40s and 50s. It's too bad that there are only a handful of correspondence from Capote's celebrated period following the release of \\"In Cold Blood,\\" a book which turned him into a celebrity. I suppose he was too busy with his success and celebrity to write letters during this period. There is nothing about his famous Black and White Ball or the infamous article which scandalized the jet set. Hardly anything is here from the 70s either, a period in which he was practically a household name, appearing in movies and talk shows.<br /><br />What is included are letters to his editors, Robert Linscott and Bennett Cerf, discussing his work and responding to criticism. Many letters to his lovers also are included but Capote seemed to have been very discreet (unlike in public life). Letters to David Selznick and Jennifer Jones give us a glimpse into the years of Hollywood life but very little juicy gossip - they leave the reader wanting more. During the years of Capote's research for \\"In Cold Blood,\\" he corresponded frequently with Alvin Dewey, the detective in charge of the case, and his wife Marie. These letters are mainly questions from Capote concerning details of the case and Capote providing the Deweys with access to his Hollywood friends. Letters to the Dewey's son, Alvin Jr., show remarkable affection and advice and criticism to an aspiring writer.<br /><br />Capote was a wanderer and his letters were written from his various residences across the globe - Sicily, Spain, Paris, Switzerland, Venice, California, New York, Alabama, etc. Jack Dunphy, his longtime companion is often mentioned with love and affection. Cecil Beaton and Christopher Isherwood were also frequent correspondents, but again, very little gossip.<br /><br />The letters do show that Capote was obviously a very compassionate man and despite his biting wit and bitchy persona, they reveal a warm and caring man.y compassionate man and despite his biting wit and bitchy persona, they reveal a warm and caring man.	2004-12-07

In the midst of the investigation, we get a glimpse of life within an antique shop/apartment house owned by Inez Ferry. Her tenants include an eclectic assortment of characters and of course one of them is the killer. In typical Rendell fashion, the killer is revealed by page 100 but the how and why is not and as the killer himself seeks an answer as to why he is doing these deeds, so is the reader and it keeps us turning the pages.<br /><br />Ruth Rendell never ceases to amaze and I truly wonder how she comes up with these intriguing plots and interesting characters. It is common for such an assortment of characters to come together in some fashion or be connected some way but I was surprised to see that they really do not in this novel. Still, Rendell's prose is highly engrossing and she is a master at depicting the dark side of the human psyche. These characters are among her most vivid and include one of the most sympathetic she has ever created, a young good looking mentally deficient man who becomes a suspect. The incident that leads up to him being suspected is rather heartbreaking.<br /><br />As always, one the elements that make Rendell's book so much fun is her dark humor when writing about a character or reading their thoughts. Case in point is Zeinab, a beautiful Asian women who works for Inez in the antique shop and uses her beauty to snag rich men in order to pay for her families luxuries.<br /><br />I only had one minor quip with the story and it concerns the theft of a strongbox and the thief eventually unlocking the combination by a simple guess. Highly unbelievable and unlikely but that is the only flaw in this exceptionally intriguing novel.	2004-12-06

I still remember when I read \\"Miriam\\" in my junior high school literature book. Later, I started reading all of Capote's stories and I eventually stumbled upon my all time favorite short story (of any writer) - \\"Children on Their Birthdays\\" (\\"Yesterday afternoon the six-o'clock bus ran over Miss Bobbit.\\") \\"A Christmas Memory\\" is another all time favorite and one of the most touching stories I've ever read. Capote was a master at using the English language - his words are simple, elegant, beautiful and most memorable.<br /><br />All of Capote's stories are collected here for the first time, the year that Capote would have turned 80.

There are a few photos that seem out of place (Tina Louise coming down a staircase in a short fur coat, Charlton Heston fully nude (except for a small towel) lounging in his sauna) and I'm not sure why they were included in the book as they don't really show anything about their homes. Most interesting are the three essays - the foreward by Gavin Lambert discusses who lived where and what circles they socialized with. An interview with interior designer Leonard Stanley (who worked with Tony Duquette) and Brooke Hayward features several humorous anecdotes about the big Hollywood parties, particularly those by David Selznick and Jennifer Jones. The final essay is by Elin and Jill Elisofon, daughters of Eliot Elisofon, and covers his life and personality.<br /><br />The book cover is a beautiful rich brown velvet and the photographs are excellent but for the price, I was a little disappointed - I expected more homes to be included and more stars. The essays are very entertaining (although brief) but the book is sprinkled with glaring typos..	2004-11-17

Her first book, \\"A Southern Garden,\\" published in 1942, has achieved a classic status today and it is a book that readers return to again and again for the pleasure of reading as well as Lawrence's opinions on certain plants. Lawrence lived her entire life in North Carolina taking care of her mother, writing and creating her famous garden. Her first garden was the one her mother created in Raleigh, N.C. Later, mother and daughter moved to Charlotte, N.C. to be nearer to Lawrence's sister and it was here that Elizabeth created her most famous garden. In addition to \\"A Southern Garden,\\" Lawrence published several more books during her lifetime - \\"The Little Bulbs\\" and \\"Gardens In Winter\\" as well as writing a weekly column for The Charoltte Observer. A manuscript that she was working on at the time of her death - \\"Gardening for Love,\\" was published posthumously.<br /><br />Lawrence was a keen observer of plants and kept meticulous records of bloom dates and her experiences growing them. Her interest was not confined to her own garden though - she corresponded with many gardeners throughout the United States (some well known, some not) and recorded their bloom dates to compare with her own.<br /><br />A biography of Lawrence's life has been long overdue and author Herring has done a great job depicting the life of this extradordinary woman. Granted, Lawrence led a fairly staid life, but there are some surprises along the way (for example, she did receive a marriage proposal in her later years!). What the book notably achieves is exploring the special friendship that existed between Lawrence and her friends and letter correspondents (many of which - Caroline Dornan, William Lanier Hunt, Katherine White, etc. - are profiled in detail). The title itself refers to a quote from Lawrence which emphasizes that gardening is not a solitary endeavor.	2004-11-15

That is nothing new since most commentators fall into one of the two categories, but what sets Coulter apart is her vicious and unapologetic nature. Her latest book is merely a collection of her columns written during the last five years. Some of them were so outrageous that they were refused publication by USA Today, Good Housekeeping, National Review, etc. etc. Coulter's neverending smugness and sometimes humorous (but desperate) one-liners grow tiresome very quickly. Only hard core conservatives and hate mongers will find anything of value here. The obvious unhappy and cranky person here is the author herself who would probably feel more at home in the eighteenth century.	2004-10-20

She was the first woman to receive a degree in landscape architecture from the North Carolina State College School of Design and her books and newspaper columns chronicled her experiences growing plants in her gardens in Raleigh, North Carolina and later, Charlotte, North Carolina.<br />Lawrence was obsessive about dates and she kept meticulous notes recording the earliest and latest bloom dates for every plant she grew. She was also an enthusiastic correspondent with other gardeners throughout the United States and she was eager to learn what was blooming in other parts of the country so that she could compare them with plants in her own garden. Among the many correspondents that she quotes often in her books are Mr. Kippendorf (Lawrence was the epitomy of a genteel southern lady and always addresses everyone as &quot;Mr.&quot; or &quot;Mrs.), a man who grew thousands of bulbs on his Ohio property, and Caroline Dormon, a Louisiana gardener who also did the line drawings for this book. Lawrence was also fond of E.A. Bowles, the English gardener who published several gardening classics and she quotes him often in this book.<br />Lawrence's writing however is not just a chronology of bloom dates. She was a gifted writer and her descriptions of colors, nature, birds in her garden and the seasonal changes are wonderful. Her writing is pure enchantment and her enthusiasm is contagious. Her books are great for winter reading as well as a good reference source throughout the year (her &quot;Southern Garden&quot; includes her records for bloom dates in her garden). This book, &quot;Gardens in Winter&quot; begins in November and stretches through Feb. 14, when she says that spring begins in her garden. She writes about all types of plants but camellias, bulbs, hollies and viburnums are discussed at lenghth. Above all, Lawrence proves to the reader that the southern garden is anything but dead during the winter months.reader that the southern garden is anything but dead during the winter months.	2004-01-26

Sections are divided into four catergories which cover the various aspects and time periods of the horror genre. &quot;The Gothic&quot; covers films released during the silent era, the 30s and early 40s that dealt with supernatural creatures (like &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&quot;). &quot;The Psychic&quot; covers the horror period of the 40s in which films took on a more cerebral tone (&quot;Cat People,&quot; &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray,&quot; &quot;The Uninvited&quot;). &quot;The Atomic&quot; deals with the 50s sci-fi trend (&quot;Creature From The Black Lagoon,&quot; &quot;Them&quot;).

Druse's books are always a treat and this one is no exception. He writes about his own garden in New Jersey and how he has developed it since 1995 and his future plans for it. He also profiles ten other gardeners and the spectacular gardens that they have created. Most of these gardens are filled with native plants, trees and shrubs and tropical plants (you won't any flower gardens here). They are all beautiful and the photographs are spectacular, the book is truly a visual feast. He also includes sections with practical advice on transplanting, incorporating water into the garden and garden photography. Perfect for the winter gardener needing their creative juices fired back up before next spring.	2004-01-03

It is scholarly yet readable, funny (in the right places) and utterly fascinating. The author discusses a variety of popular beliefs such as ESP, spirit communication, alien abduction, near death experiences, creationism and Holocaust denial and gives a decent explanation of why people believe such things but even better, he debunks them with practical reason and scientific evidence. He also shows how dangerous right wing fanatics and extremists (such as the Holocaust deniers) are and how their close-minded rhetoric is a threat to us all. On a lighter note, the author's recollections of his appearances on Oprah, Phil Donahue and other talk shows is sometimes hilarious. Thoughtful, intelligent and should be required reading in colleges.	2003-12-31

James, it would have to be that she takes too long to write her books. There is usually a 2-3 year wait between books but when she releases one, it is something to be excited about. &quot;The Murder Room&quot; is no exception and while it is not as lofty as some of her earlier novels, it is a taut little thriller and a delightful read. The first 100 pages are devoted to introducing the murder scene (a musuem) and a host of suspects. After the first murder occurs, it is not long before other victims start piling up! In addition to James' extraordinary attention to characterization, her descriptons of architecture, gardens, furnishings, etc. is wonderful. She truly makes the reader feel as though they are in the setting. It is obvious that James got her idea of an important plot event from a highly publcized film that came out a few years ago but no matter, the book delivers and fans should be pleased with this one.	2003-12-31

The text is over 700 pages and each film of Hitchcock's career is covered in detail, with particular attention to his relationships with his collaborators (screenwriters, costumers, musicians, actors, etc.). Hitckcock's creative genius was unique - he could visualize his film down to the most minute detail before the cameras even rolled (indeed after the script was completed he felt that filming the work was the most boring aspect of it). Script conferences were lengthy and detailed and Hitchcock's mulling and proscrastination often drove many screenwriters to distraction. Those who perservered however, earned respect and dedication from Hitchcock. Despite the book's meticulous attention to detail (some readers might find the analysis of Hitchcock's contract details with David Selznick exasperating), the personal character of Hitchcock shines through. He was a devoted family man, faithful and respectful of his wife Alma Reville, whose opinion he valued above all others when it came to criticism of his work. But he was also a passive admirer of beautiful actresses, often becoming obsessive with them, with sometimes devastating results. He was also a highly sensitive man and despite his own tendency to be unforgiving when crossed and boorish on the set, he was easily hurt by comments about his weight, habits, etc. And he loved animals and would not watch a film that depicted cruelty to animals (one of his favorite films was &quot;Benji&quot;.) A lover of life, travel, good food and wine but most of all his work, his life is shown here as an exuberant one and not as dark as depicted in Donald Spoto's earlier biography. A wonderful read and highly recommended!	2003-12-01

This book might make me change my mind though. Savannah is indeed a beautiful historical city, filled with charming little gardens and Georgian Colonial and Greek Revival architecture. Behind some of the walls and iron gates are these tiny paradises filled with semi-tropical foliage and old fashioned southern flowers. This tour showcases these gardens, both public and private ones. Chapters are arranged by garden type - walled gardens, side gardens, historical gardens, pocket gardens, rooftop gardens, container gardens, treelawns, work spaces, etc. Descriptions are included but the highlight of the book is easily the outstanding photographs. The author also includes a &quot;must-have&quot; plant list for the southern gardener and a month-by-month planting guide. This is a beautiful book sure to inspire the gardener even if we can't grow some of the tender varities featured here.	2003-11-24

It lists the locations of cultural landmarks and many entries have a photograph, but not all. Chapters are divided by &quot;History and Tragedy,&quot; &quot;Crime, Murder &amp; Assassination,&quot; &quot;Celebrity Deaths,&quot; &quot;Movies,&quot; &quot;Music,&quot; &quot;Sports,&quot; etc. Landmarks such as the subway grating where Marilyn Monroe posed, Manson Family murder sites, the spot where Zsa Zsa slapped the policeman and Hugh Grant picked up a prostitute are all here. Some entries leave you yearning for more information - for example, it would be interesting to know what became of some of the famous celebrity houses and who lives there now. This information is sometimes noted but often it is not. Photos for ALL of the sites would have been nice too but many do not have photos. Lots of fun though and hopefully this will be a book that will be updated.	2003-11-20

This book is a collection of 33 essays written by rosarians,  writers, artists, nurserymen, etc. on their personal favorite rose. It is delightful reading and the book comes at a good time, when most gardeners are settling in for the winter months to dream about next year's gardening.<br />The majority of the writers here prefer the old roses although there are a few modern ones as well. Graham Stuart Thomas, the great rosarian who died in April 2003, writes about his favorite rose &quot;Souevenir de St. Anne's,&quot; Peter Beales recalls &quot;Great Maiden's Blush&quot; which brings back his childhood memories and Christopher Lloyd writes about his love/hate relationship with roses in his garden at Great Dixter.

The size of the new edition is a little larger than the old one but it is still a comfortable size for reading in bed or taking with you to the nursery. 380 roses are covered here, from all rose classes. 200+ pages are glossy and contain a color photograph of each rose. The gallery is followed by an &quot;encyclopedia of roses&quot; which gives basic information about growing the rose and how best to use it in the garden. A brief introduction covers the basics of buying roses, growing and caring for them. A chart is also included which explains pest and diseases and offers ecologically safe controls.<br />This is a good guide but if you are seeking a book that is more comprehensive and includes a larger selection of roses, you might want to check out &quot;Botanica's Roses&quot; by William Grant. This book includes over 2000 roses and is priced similarly. Also, the just released &quot;American Rose Society Encyclopedia of Roses&quot; is also outstanding but much higher in price.	2003-10-03

The introductory chapters, on the history of the rose and cultivation techniques, are solid and well written. The illustrations here (line drawings) are excellent. The heart of the book is profiles of individual roses. Each entry is illustarted with a beautiful photo, brief info about height, flower size and number of petals, followed by a few descriptive paragraphs. A list of alternative roses (those similar to the major one profiled) is also included. Sections in the back include a glossary of technical terms, a detailed guide to the classification of roses (with a list of individual varieties for each), profiles of rose awards and prizes throughout the world and the great breeders and creators of roses. This is a small book, easy to carry around and read in bed, and a very enjoyable read. It is not a complete guide but one that is nevertheless useful. The photographs alone make it a worthwhile purchase.	2003-10-02

Unlike many rose reference books, this one seems to include roses familiar to us here in the U.S. (although I must note that the authors are British). Each entry includes basic info, like parentage, flower size, flowering habits, height/spread and hardiness. This is followed by a description of the rose and the type of climate it excels in. And, I'm happy to see that the authors have indentified individuals who have roses named after them and explains who they were! This information has always been rather difficult to locate. A photo of the rose is included and, for the most part, they are very good (there are a few that are so-so).<br />Other notable features are articles and sidebars that deal with the history of the rose, notable hybridizers in the profession and famous nurseries and rose gardens. A brief concluding section covers planting and caring for roses with good demonstration photos.<br />This is a big book, 448 pages, and one that will be very helpful to refer to when considering a rose.	2003-10-01

Sections are divided by rose classifications (Albas, Bourbons, Gallicas, etc.) and includes a very small listing of roses in each class (usually less than 10) and only offers a brief (usually one sentence) description. Chapters in the back of the book show how to care for roses (planting, pruning, etc.), arrange roses and dry roses. Overall, a good introduction to roses but by no means a guide for selection.

The author is from England so you might want to consult other books to see if a particular rose will grow well in your region. However, the advice this author gives is highly worthwhile. He covers over 200 roses (arranged as &quot;Bush&quot; roses and &quot;Climbing&quot; roses) and devotes 2 lengthy paragraphs to each one. The descriptions are poetic and the author also suggests ways of using the rose in the garden (color schemes, etc.) Lists are included at the back of the book which notes roses by categories (colors, good foliage, shade, small gardens, scent, informal gardens, structures). Hardiness zone maps cover both the U.S. and Europe. The photographs are excellent and are mainly close-ups (although there are outstanding full garden shot photos in the introductory chapters).	2003-09-26

Stephens in 1933 and the other by Graham Stuart Thomas in 1965).<br />Over 1600 roses are covered here. They are arranged in chapters by classes (Chinese Synstylae and other species, Rosa gigantea and Rosa chinensis, Aryshire and Evergreen roses, Rosa setigera and the Boursault Roses, Noisettes and Tea roses, Rosa multiflora, Turner's Crimson Rambler Race, Wichurana hybrids, New Dawn and its descendants, Kordesii hybrids, Climbing Sports and Large Flowered Climbers). Within each of these chapters, the author divides the roses by hybridizer. A richly detailed biographical account of the breeder is usually given which is followed by a list of the roses he/she hybridized and a brief description of each rose. A final chapter, &quot;Cultivating Climbing Roses&quot; discusses growing roses in general. A section of 200 beautiful color plates is featured in the center of the book.<br />Only one gripe - sizes of roses is given in the metric system which is annoying but at least it will help you to learn meters and centimeters!	2003-09-22

The author profiles each plant with a very thorough description (including growing advice) followed by a list of plants that will compliment it in the garden. It is also accompanied by a photo. The photographs in the book are mouth-watering to say the least! The only gripe I had was that the list of plants provided with each entry is listed with the Latin plant name which is often bewildering to novice gardeners. However, a common name list is located in the back of the book, which helps remedy the situation. Very highly recommend. A gorgeous book!	2003-08-25

The author, who became a close friend and confidante of Head in her later years, manages to penetrate her secretive core and paint a fascinating yet objective biography of her.<br />Edith Head rose through the ranks at Paramount before becoming head of the costume department in the late 30s and held the position for over 30 years. But she was basically an insecure woman who craved publicity and acceptance and managed to achieve it by hard work, tenacity and sometimes deceptive manipulation. It is true that she sometimes took credit for other designer's work (most notably Givenchey for the 1954 film &quot;Sabrina&quot;) and she was often ridiculed by her colleages. But, she was adept and hard-working in her craft, and she had a knack for communicating and pleasing the actresses and directors that she worked with.<br />The book combines just the right amount of biographical detail with juicy Hollywood gossip (especially about Claudette Colbert!) to keep you turning the pages. The book also depicts a touching portrait of Head's longtime marriage to Bill Ihnen and debunks the longtime rumor that Head was a lesbian. The book's one major fault is the lack of photos - only a small color section and a few b&amp;w are scattered throughout - not enough to illustrate her work at all. But aside from this one quibble, I recommend it.	2003-05-22

Each of these are illustrated with lush photos of Smith's own garden as well as his clients gardens.<br />The last section of the book discusses techniques and ideas on how to plan and construct your garden.

Aside from snippets about her stepfather and Christina Crawford, everything is old hat. Indeed, this book tends to focus more on her movies, giving a lenghty snyopsis of each one and analyzing her acting as well as her co-stars, and while there is nothing wrong with this, it has been done before!  Aside from the movie analysis', the authors always follow with a paragraph or two on who Joan went to bed with during the making of the film (which, unless he was gay, married or ugly, was just about all of them). I was hoping for a biography that delved more into Crawford's private life - what made this woman tick? - what kind of beliefs did she have? - what did she do when she was not working on the set? - what did she eat for dinner at night?. This pedestrian bio only scratches the surface - by page 10, Crawford has already made her first movie - very little info about how she reached this stage in her life is given. The authors apparently only talked to a handful of people for this book and most of the information apparently comes from the author's own interviews with her in the 50s and 60s. And it is very annoying when the author (or co-author) writes about himself as if he were someone else! So, sadly, a definitive biography of Crawford has yet to be published.	2003-01-17

Wetlands cover a substantial portion of Alabama as well, covering some 3+ million acres. Before this region was settled, almost 8 million acres of wetlands were present. These wetlands are home to thousands of wildlife species and birds. Sadly, the wetlands of Alabama are often misunderstood and most people incorrectly associate them as mosquito infested bogs. This book serves as a showcase of spectacular photographic images by Robert Falls Sr. to illustrate just how beautiful these areas are. The text by Doug Phillips describes how the state of Alabama's economy and livlihood depend on these waters and it also delves into the scary possibility of endangerment and what this would mean to our state. The author makes future projections about the state's population growth and identifies areas that will have the most growth and how these areas will be impacted. This is a beautiful book filled with breathtaking images - a snowy egret perched on a log in the middle of a fog shrouded lake, breathtaking sunsets over bayous, close-ups of pitcher plants and water lilies, an alligator advancing from a stand of grass along the waters edge, etc. It should be an essential purchase for Alabama libraries and anyone who is interested in Alabama's ecology and environment.	2002-11-26

An introductory sections discusses the movers and shakers of the Arts and Crafts Movement, like William Morris, William Robinson, Gertrude Jekyll and Gustav Stickley. The final chapter is devoted to the architectural firm of Greene and Greene, whose style was a major influence. Most of the houses and gardens photographed here are on the West Coast (mainly Seattle, WA, Portland, OR and Pasadena, CA) although there are some Rhode Island properties included as well. A final section is devoted to planting the garden and includes lists of plants which are good for any situation imaginable. This is a wonderful book - beautiful, unique and inspiring!	2002-11-26

Each profile is an average 3 page spread which shows one photo with a brief introduction and then has a page on the &quot;design details&quot; (palette, bed and bedding and furnishings) and a concluding page on &quot;What Makes The Look&quot;. The author seems to have chosen her subjects carefully, as a wide array of styles are represented here - from the opulent, Renaissance inspired rooms of the Versaces to the cold, spare, ultra modern rooms of Derrick Colman and Marshall Coburn. Other styles include the Southwestern motif (Stanley Weston), Moroccan (Tyra Banks), and Oriental (Mary Tyler Moore). Some rooms show how carefully selected colors can evoke a calming mood (like in Deborah Norville, Joan Rivers and Paula Abdul's bedrooms). And some may just make you want to go &quot;UGH&quot; (sorry Mary Higgins Clark and Blaine Trump). Other celebrities included are Cher, Princess Diana, Patti Labelle, Ali MacGraw, Natalie Cole, Angel Sanchez, Lillian Vernon, Junior Johnson, Wesley Snipes, Mickey Rourke, Renzo Rosso, Peter Vitale, Charles Shaunghnessy and more.	2002-11-26

This latest offering - her first ever collection of short stories (to appear in the U.S. at least) - contains five stories which average around 30 pages each. This is indeed refreshing! George includes an introductory preface to each story explaining her inspiration for writing them. The first one is a reworking of an earlier story she did and is, in my opinion, the weakest of the five. It involves a murder among a group of architecture students visiting a manor estate. Thomas Lynley makes an appearance in this one and solves the case with ease. \\"The Surprise of His Life\\" was inspired by a famous celebrity murder case (and it is obvious from George's description that it was the O.J. Simpson case) and involves a man who, prompted by a psychic, becomes increasingly paranoid that his wife is cheating on him. The third story (and my personal favorite) shows what happens when an eccentric old woman with a peculiar fondness for rats moves into a cozy New England neighborhood. \\"Remember I'll Always Love You\\" is the story of a woman who discovers that her recently deceased young husband led a mysterious life outside their marriage and the final story, \\"I, Richard\\", follows a man whose literary masterpiece, an enlightenment on the life of Richard III, results in dire consequences. All of the stories are page turners and most of them end with surprising conclusions. Many are psychological in nature and reminded me of the works of Ruth Rendell. Recommended!	2002-10-31

Readers who enjoy books like \\"Rebecca\\" and \\"Jane Eyre\\" will not be disappointed if you revel in a character who finds romance and mystery while living in a brooding mansion filled with hidden corridors and lurking servants while the winds and storm rage outside. In this respect, the book delivers. Gaywyck, the name of the house, is wonderfully depicted on a grand scale. However, what killed the book for me is the simmering sod of a lead character who is reduced to tears at the drop of a hat. And if he is not crying, he's either cowering in fear, fainting or sick in bed. How the hulky and brooding master of the house, Donough Gaylord, falls for this [guy] is both absurb and unbelievable. So, instead of cheering for Donough to sweep Robert off his feet, the reader is hoping he will throw him over the nearest cliff!	2002-10-15

This one finds Wexford and his partner, Mike Burden, investigating the death of an older woman found strangled in a parking garage at a shopping mall. Numerous suspects abound in the woman's neighborhood but Wexford is soon incapacitated, however, by a car bomb (meant for someone else). Burden takes the lead by pursuing a withdrawn young man who lives with his domineering mother. Burden's intuition fails him though and it is Wexford who eventually identifies the killer by subtly noting the habits and motivations of the suspects and even the items they purchased in the shopping mall. The book is a little overlong for a Wexford mystery and gets sluggish a little in the middle but picks back up toward the end. Every character seems like a likely culprit (the victim was a blackmailer) and it is hard to see what is coming until close to the last chapter. If you are just beginning with Ruth Rendell, don't let this one detract you from her - she is one of the best writers in the world today.	2002-09-01

It gives detailed lists of magazine articles, books, newspaper articles, etc. with information about the content, photos, etc. of each article. The biography is brief (under 100 pages) but very well written and engaging and is good for those looking for a general synopsis of her life. For those looking for a juicy biography with more content, you will probably want to look elsewhere (actually the only full length biography of Jennifer Jones so far is &quot;Portrait of Jennifer&quot; by Edward Epstein). This book also includes some wonderful black and white photos.	2002-01-28

This is a gorgeously illustrated book with hundreds of ideas to inspire the gardener who wants to add architectural elements to their garden. Be aware, however, that this is mainly a collection of photographs and does not provide much in the way of how to actually go about constructing these projects yourself.

Brief captions are provided for each photo. Unlike the previous reviewer, I don't have any objections to the quality of the photos. I think they are quite good and there were several images that I had never seen before. But then again, I do not consider myself an expert on photographic print quality. Overall I don't think that seasoned film lovers will find much new here and it may not be worth the price to you. However, if your library of film books is scant or if you are someone who is just discovering classic movies, then this would be a great purchase. Makes a good coffee table book too!	2001-12-07

First up, he seduces the mannish 60 year old Cecile de Rothschild and through her, he meets her elusive friend, Greta Garbo (herself in her 60's). A brief tryst with her follows and he ends up seducing her as well, however, you can read between the lines and realize that Garbo was a woman who was not interested in sex (if anything, the chapter on her illustrates what a strange woman she was and it is evident that she probably could have used the services of a psychiatrist).<br />After tiring of Garbo's eccentricies and her iciness (she ignores him and is embarrassed while he chokes on a fish bone at a dinner party), he proceeds to his next conquest, a rich widow in her 80's. (Note: A strong stomach is required for the sex scenes - disgusting is no other way to describe them!)  This woman (Lydia Deterding) ends up buying Gargia several apartments but their affair becomes the laughing stock of the jet set community. Believe it or not, Gargia does have some modesty and he leaves her for a nympho Countess, whose husband dies soon after they begin their affair. They enjoy the good life for a while until her funds start to get low and she kicks him out after he won't get a job.<br />By this time, Gargia has lost his looks and he romances a magazine editor and decides to start a magazine called \\"The Best\\", based on a frivolous awards event that he created (a big excuse to hold yet another big party bash). After all, can you really take an award seriously whose recipients include LaToya Jackson, Fidel Castro or Ivana Trump???<br />Gargia wraps up with stories about the Royal Family and how he ingratiated himself into their circle. Some rumors about a possible Princess Diana conspiracy are lightweight, at most. If Gargia's book does serve any worthwhile purpose, it does show how frivolous and wasteful the \\"Jet Set\\" live their lives.into their circle.

Beginning with Jarman's childhood, it was easy to see that he was highly sensitive to beauty and the arts - he was fascinated with flowers and nature which would lead to his development of his famous garden at Dungeness. Also, he was greatly affected by the art and entertainment medium around him - when his parents took him to the cinema for the first time, it was to see &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and Jarman was so wrapped up in the film that he closed out everything else around him and thought the events occuring in front of him were real and at one point, to the embarrassment of his parents, ran screaming up the aisles in terror. Jarman's early adult years found him leading a very bohemian existence, experimenting with art and film and exploring his homosexuality. He was especially drawn to filmmaking and would eventually direct such avant garde features as &quot;Sebastiane&quot; and &quot;The Last of England&quot;. When he was diagnosed with AIDS in the mid 80's, he became more and more involved in activism for AIDS reasearch and the basic rights of gays and lesbians. Jarman had many critics, both to his work and his activism, but he never buckled to them and spoke out any time he felt an injustice was being served. Peake's biography is daunting (533 pages) but it is not heavy handed and you almost feel that you are sitting with someone who knew Jarman well, listening to his stories about him. The last chapters deal with Jarman's devastating battle with AIDS, which left him crippled and blind, and if the last poem in the book (taken from Jarman's film &quot;Blue&quot;) does not leave you teary eyed, nothing will.	2001-09-14

Strieber's vivid imagery (I can never forget the descriptions of Miriam Blaylock's house),clever plot devices as well as the depiction of glamourous and rich vampires was unforgettable. I was very excited to hear that Miriam Blaylock was back in &quot;The Last Vampire&quot; but am disappointed with the book. It starts off very good and Strieber's descriptive prose weaves yet another dreamy spell as we follow Miriam through the streets of Bangkok and Paris seeking out &quot;The Keepers&quot; to warn them of a group of destructive humans that threaten their existence. About half way, though, the plot begins to disintegrate as Miriam unbeleivably falls in love with a very cocky and unlikable CIA agent. It is all too much and some chapters, such as the one where they finally make love, is unbelievably stupid as Miriam runs around screaming &quot;I'm in love, I'm in love!&quot;. The chapter contains some of the worst dialog I have ever read! The ending sets the book up for a sequel but the whole turn of events in Miriam's life is disappointing, unbelievable and a let down.	2001-08-28

(her last book, &quot;The Breaker&quot; was a big disappointment). But &quot;The Shape of Snakes&quot; is a taut and chilling novel, brilliantly told through brief narratives intersperced with letters, e-mails and even photographs - this is the first fiction book that I have ever read which has photographs of the characters!<br />It is also a very disturbing book and her depictions of animal cruelty, racism and spousal abuse are stark and vivid. The book is almost impossible to put down, however, because of Walter's engrossing style and characters which are fascinating albeit not very likable. The leading character, M. Renalagh (we are never told her first name) is quite the character herself and not someone you want on your bad side!<br />If you can stomach the unpleasantness aspects, this is a highly recommended read.	2001-08-22

Natalie Wood's mother makes Joan Crawford look like Snow White and the lengths this woman went to to ensure her daughter's success is sometimes chilling. The author apparently interviewed numerous associates of Natalie Wood from both her childhood and later life and (for the most part) you feel that you know Natalie from reliable sources and not from fan magazines, books and other questionable sources. The only area that the author seems sketchy on is Woods' mysterious death and perhaps no one will really ever know that full story.<br />The negative points of the book is the length and the authors tendency to be repepitive. If you read about Wood's fear of &quot;dark water&quot; one time, you hear about it a thousand times and the same with her abnormal wrist, her mother's superstitions, etc. etc. Also, I felt the author spent way too much time on Woods' childhood, it seems to go on forever. However, these quips aside, I can recommend the book highly for anyone interested in Natalie Wood as well as a powerful portrait of a child star in Hollywood during the 40's.	2001-08-07

Over 130 varieties are covered in an encyclopedic format and an entire page is devoted (sometimes two) to each plant. The text is clearly written in an engaging style and everything that you need to know (growing requirements, if the plant is easy or difficult to grow, size of the plants, etc.) is covered. The best thing about the book are the photographs - they provide the reader with a full view of how the plant grows in the garden and numerous photos are provided for each plant. He also includes lists of plants that are good for specific locations and conditions (such as good groundcovers, drought tolerant plants, plants for shade, etc.)  This is a big, heavy book so it is one that you might can't carry to bed with you for nighttime reading (although you probably will want to!).	2001-04-09

She is a strong advocate of naturalistic gardening and encourages gardeners to seek out the native plants growing in their particular area and use them to their greatest advantage in an entirely organic way. She begins by discussing the principles of design with the &quot;five senses of the garden&quot; (welcome, enclosure, entry, flow, and place) and continues with other design principles such as &quot;green architecture&quot; (elements of the garden such as plants and structures), creating natural backdrops, &quot;sandwich gardening&quot; (intermingling plants in the same location), and using combinations and vignettes. Other informative sections focus on paths and walkways, layering plants to scale, and problem-solving. Helpful charts list specific plants for certain situations. The last third of the book focuses on maintenance and offers clearcut advice and instructions on mulching, composting, etc. Included at the end of the volume is a 34-page workbook for readers to list plant choices, set goals, and create their own garden plan.	2001-04-02

What a career! - invitations for great weekend getaways with the rich and famous, staying at luxiourious hotels and riding on private jets, dinners during the week with her close friends Barbara Walters and Joel Schumaker. When you get to the chapter where she reveals that she has been Katharine Hepburn's guest at Fenwick on several ocassions, the average reader may feel that their own life is pretty drab. Liz Smith does not reveal that much about herself but her engaging personality comes through in her writing. It is apparent that she is fair, honest, and extremely likable. When she does dish the dirt on a few famous names (and this happens only a few times), it is because they actually deserve it. Lee Radziwell and theater critic John Simon, for example, have been exposed by others in the press as mean spirited individuals, and Smith's quoting of their comments really comes as no surprise. What is surprising are the people that I didn't really expect to like (like Ivana Trump) and Smith allows you to see them in a different light. Smith sometimes make you wonder if she herself is somewhat snobbish toward the common people - she is irritated to find that Roy Cohn has invited a lowly tv repairman to dine with them and Barbara Walters. And one of the things that she dislikes about ballooning is the fact that you sometimes have to share a brandy with the farmer in who's field you have landed. Well, I suppose she can't be perfect. Her book is a very entertaining read and recommended for those who are curious about the private lives of the rich and famous.	2000-11-27

This is a very entertaining and beautifully illustrated story of the rise of Gene Marshall. Anyone who has enjoyed reading Hollywood history and movie star biographies will love this. The story is told in snippets from studio memos, a gossip column, and excerpts from the biographies of Madra Lord, Trent Osborn, Eric Von Sternberg and others. It all begins with Gene's childhood and ends with the debut of her first film &quot;Blonde Lace&quot;. There are some new characters introduced into Gene's story such as Trent Osborne, an aging actor who has dated Madra Lord and Ivy Jordan, a character actress who becomes Gene's friend. The photographs are cleverly done and the illustrations are wonderful. Anyone who has studied Hollywood lore will see the similiaries to real life stories and situations and that makes it all the more fun. The only reason I don't give the book 5 stars is because it ends too early. An entire synopsis of Gene's career would have been welcome. It really leaves you wanting more.	2000-10-26

While researching the history of the house,  Wallinger learned that the garden was designed by the great garden designer  Gertrude Jekyll. She had no interest in gardening before she moved to Upton  Grey, but she did recognize Gertrude Jekyll's stature in gardening history,  and so she set out to restore the garden to its original splendor, a task  that would take more than a decade. She located Jekyll's original plans at  the University of California and began a difficult process of translating  the plans from Jekyll's bad handwriting and attempting to locate the plants  that were originally used in the garden. Fortunately for us and herself,  Wallinger kept a journal in which she documented her progress. The before  and after photographs are amazing and the reader becomes quickly engrossed  in Wallinger's project as well as a growing attachment to her menagerie of  dogs, ducks and geese. This beautiful book will be an inspriation to any  gardener, especially those have a formidable gardening challenge ahead of  them.	2000-08-28

Books	4	8	10	N	N	An entertaining read	If you love the film &quot;All About Eve&quot; or about the making of  classic Hollywood films in general, you will probably love this book. 350  pages on &quot;All About Eve&quot;? Yes, and not a bit boring, I might add.  There are tantalizing bits of information here about the stars of the film  (Bette Davis and Celeste Holm disliked each other immensely and Marilyn  Monroe was so nervous in her scenes with Davis that she would become  physically sick afterwards) as well as behind the scenes stories of how the  film came to be and the woman who was the inspiration for the character of  Eve. Sidebars give other interesting info (such as the salaries of the  actors). A glossary includes definitions of real names that are dropped in  the dialogue of the film (I always wanted to know who &quot;Mrs.  Fiske&quot; was, now I know). The only drawback is the author's habit of  reading too much into symbolism that, more than likely, was never there in  the first place. Also, a neverending gushing for the line &quot;You can put  this award where your heart ought to be&quot; (it is obvious that this is  the author's favorite line, he mentions it in almost every chapter). But  these minor faults can be overlooked. The book is highly entertaining and  film buffs will enjoy it.	2000-08-15

The most  valuable aspect are the photographs because they show how the rose grows in  different situations, such as on a fence, an arbor, etc. There are  close-ups of the rose and views of the entire plant.

US	52957646	RKWIPX95JDABE	0553577301	998428562	Death of a Garden Pest: A Gardening Mystery	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A fun read, especially for gardeners	If you are in the mood for a light hearted mystery that is fun and full of gardening tips, then this is for you. Ripley goes along at a leisurly rate (the murder does not occur until around page 100) but her characters are  interesting and fun. Every third chapter or so, there is a small gardening  essay covering various topics such as composting, organic pest controls,  roses, etc. If you are not into gardening, you can skip these because they  are essentially unrelated to the plot.	2000-05-23

She does a wonderful job of describing southern Mississippi and the Natchez Trace. You can almost feel the heat and the humidity! Her characters are also well developed, and as you will see from the  hypocritical religious characters, true to life in this part of the  country. Anna Pigeon is a very interesting character and I look forward to  reading more of Barr's books.	2000-05-02

Reed writes in a simple, straighforward style that is easy to follow and the accompanying photos are excellent. He shows how to construct a beautiful  dry stacked retaining wall and I never imagined that it is so easy. I also  found the chapter on building a waterfall very helpful and I hope to do  this soon. Also covered are chapters on making paths, courtyards, steps,  terraces, benches, etc. It is an excellent book, well worth the money and  one that I have referred to countless times.	2000-04-27

Our plants often suffer as a result. This book, divided by sections of the southeast and the southwest, shows what plants will do  well in these climates. The author also discusses winter gardening and how  the sunbelt gardener can successfully have color in their gardens year  round. The book is well organized and the photographs are spectacular. It  will serve as a valuable reference to gardeners in this region.	2000-04-11

This one captured my attention from the very beginning and never let go. Martinelli is such an appealing character and I enjoy the way the author weaves her home life and those close to her into  the story. In the end, when you think about the actual number of suspects  (not that many) you will be still be surprized at the outcome. The last  chapter is one of the most suspensful that I have read in a while.	2000-03-14

That thought aside, the authors do provide a sound case against what most Americans think of as &quot;good landscaping&quot;. Get rid of the water  guzzling lawn, bring on the native plants! It is a book with a good message  and should be read.	2000-03-14

That said, her latest is great to read but it lacks the usual punch that her novels  usually have. There is a lot going on in this one and you keep thinking  that the different sub-plots will weave together with the others in the end  but they don't. I thought that the book should have been shorter and there  is a lot of detail, such as the pursuit of a suspect that does not pan out,  that could have been left out. The villan, in this case a wife beater, is a  deliciously despised character and the reader will get a smug satisfaction  when he gets his punishment.	2000-01-19

It is a tightly paced and beautifully written novel that is as fascinating as it is disturbing.  The well  developed characters really pull you into the story and the author's  depiction of Brogan, a lonely and abandoned boy haunted by the memories of  his dead mother, is poignant. It is a human story but one that dwells on  the dark thoughts that reside in the human mind. Martin has been compared  to Minette Walters and while I have not read enough of Walters book to  agree to the comparison, I will say that Martin's writing is as compelling  as Ruth Rendell, my favorite mystery writer.  I think Martin has a bright  writing career ahead of her, and I can't wait to read her next book.	1999-11-09

Although most of the gardens are in England, any gardener can gets ideas from this book.  It is basically a &quot;coffee  table&quot; type book and is one that you can get lost in on a rainy day.  I would highly recommend it!	1999-11-02

It is written in clear, easy to understand language and he does not spend a lot of time on topics that would be better suited to the professional.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to do a web page but does not know where to begin.	1997-11-22
