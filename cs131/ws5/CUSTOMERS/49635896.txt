John Carter only has a cameo in this book.  The real star of the book is Carter's son, Carthoris, along with his lady love, Thuvia.  It's a typical example of early 20th Century science fiction, although better written than the average sci-fi story.  Thuvia gets kidnapped, Carthoris goes off to rescue her.  Along the way, they discover another lost city of Mars (things like that happen a lot in these books).  If you are interested in early science fiction, this is an entertaining example of the genre.	2005-09-21

I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but it's about the owner of diner who stops two killers from robbing him, killing one of the thugs in the process.  He becomes a media celebrity because of the incident, much to his dismay.  The publicity brings him to the attention of some bad men, who think he may be a man that they have been looking for.

This book introduces the characters and begins the course of events that sustain the first three novels of the series.  Nayland Smith, Special Commisioner, having detected signs of organized insurgency in the Far East, surprises his good friend Dr. Petrie one quiet evening in London.  He astounds the good doctor with tales of Eastern terrors and intrigue revolving around the figure of a mysterious Chinese doctor named Fu-Manchu, the evil genius at the center of a plot to subjugate the white races to oriental domination.  As the plot unfolds, we, along with these two stout-hearted Englishmen, encounter many of Dr. Fu-Manchu's terrifying agents, including numerous representatives of mysterious Asiatic strangler cults, and frequent evidence of the Doctor's evil genius in the shape of the deadly drugs he has produced and the lethal bugs, apes and fungi he has bred.  We also move in and out of opium dens, subterranean passageways, and loathsome dungeons in the very heart of the modern metropolis and in the peaceful bosom of  the English countryside.  The irresitibly seductive Egyptian slave girl Karamaneh, Fu-Manchu's most dangerous creature, completes the cast of characters.  To reveal more, at this point, would be to spoil the pleasure and the surprise of the reader's first encounter with the thrilling and enchanting world of Dr. Fu-Manchu.	2005-06-26

Oddly, Orlando's long lifespan doesn't seem to stike other characters in the book as unusual, although his/her sex change does come into question (although most people just matter of factly accept it).  This is an interesting book that allows Virginia Woolf to make witty observations about English society and the differences between men and women.	2005-05-20

Wallace is an artist/war hero who saves a beautiful woman from commiting suicide.  The woman ends up getting kidnapped, and Wallace goes to \\"Hell and back\\" to rescue her.  That's all I will say about the plot.  Some supporting characters from previous Sin City books show up here, but I won't spoil the surprise.  This isn't the best Sin City story, but it's certainly the longest.  If you read the other Sin City books, you may experience a \\"been there, done that\\" sensation while reading this book.  Once again, a heroic guy rescues a damsel in distress.  But while the plot may be a tad familiar, I still enjoyed the book.  The artwork is as gorgeous as ever, and there are a few new touches, here and there.  This is not the first Sin City book you should read, but fans of the series will probably enjoy it.  I would recommend reading the books in order, so this would be the last one to read.	2005-04-26

This book reprints three extremely rare comic books from the Golden Age: New York World's Fair Comics 1939, New York World's Fair Comics 1940 and The Big All-American Comic Book.  If you could find a copy of one of these comics, it would cost you over $1000 to buy it, even if it was in lousy condition.  Now, you can own the contents of all three comics in mint condition, for under $100.  What a deal!  As for the contents of the comics, it is a typical mixed bag of Golden Age features.  You get superheroes like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern and many lesser lights.  There are also humor strips, detectives, military strips and other features.  Most of the features in World's Fair 1939 heavily feature the Fair.  Comics in World's Fair 1940 involve the fair to a lesser extent.  Big All-American is just typical adventures involving the featured characters.  Some of the comics are a bit dated by today's standards, but they are still fun to read.  If you are a fan of Golden Age comics, you should get this book.  You'll learn more than you ever wanted to know about the New York World's Fair!	2005-04-26

This book collects various shorter Sin City stories that were published in various comic books.  There are eleven separate stories here, so I will offer brief reviews of all of them.<br /><br />\\"Just Another Saturday Night\\" is a typical Marv story. (4 stars)<br />\\"Fat Man and Little Boy\\" is a short comedy starring small time hoods Klump and Shlubb. (4 stars)<br />\\"The Customer is Always Right\\" was the prologue in the recent Sin City [[ASIN:B001R4KQDE movie]]. (4 stars)<br />\\"Silent Night\\" is a Marv story with virtually no dialogue. (3 stars)<br />\\"And Behind Door Number Three...\\" is a brief story featuring the girls of Old Town. (3 stars)<br />\\"Blue Eyes\\" introduces the character of Delia. (4 stars)<br />\\"Rats\\" stars a Nazi war criminal. (3 stars)<br />\\"Daddy's Little Girl\\" stars the one-shot character of Johnny. (3 stars)<br />\\"Wrong Turn\\" is a longer Delia story. (4 stars)<br />\\"Wrong Track\\" is a shorter Delia story. (3 stars)<br />\\"The Babe Wore Red\\" stars Dwight and is the best story in here. (5 stars)<br /><br />So there you have it.  \\"The Babe Wore Red\\" is so great, that the book is worth getting just for that one story.  But all the other stories also have something to recommend them.  That is to say, they all have gorgeous art by Frank Miller, even if a few of them are a bit lacking in the plot department.  If you are a fan of the other Sin City books, you will probably enjoy this one, too.	2005-04-19

You really should read those books before you read this one.  This time around, Dwight and Miho are on a mission for the girls of Old Town, which I won't spoil by revealing anything about.  Unlike the other Sin City books, which are serialized and have chapters, this is a continuous story that is about 120 pages long.  It doesn't take long to read; I read the whole thing during my lunch break.  I didn't feel it was quite as good as the other \\"Dwight\\" stories, but it is still a fun, quick read.  The storyline didn't intrigue me as much this time around, but the artwork is as great as ever.  I think most of Frank Miller's fans will enjoy this book.	2005-04-18

The series is about two punk rock girls, Maggie and Hopey (and their friends and family).  Their world is a lot like our own, but with a few changes.  For instance, on their earth rocket travel is commonplace, dinosaurs still exist and professional wrestling is a legitimate sport.  The science fictional aspects of the strip were eventually dropped in favor of a more realistic style (pro wrestling was never dropped from the strip).  The comic started off pretty good, and eventually turned into a great comic.  I'm sure Jaime Hernandez himself would admit that his art and writing was much better at the end of the comic than it was in the beginning.  Anyway like I said, the comic's main characters are Maggie and Hopey, but there are many supporting characters who get a lot of coverage, too.  In fact, there are times when Maggie or Hopey go \\"missing\\" from the comic and aren't seen for a long time.  The book really hits it's stride after Maggie and Hopey \\"split up\\" and have seperate adventures.  I found myself getting really caught up in the lives of these fictional characters, reading about them grow from girls into women.  This is a big, fat, expensive book, but it is well worth the price.  Highly recommended.	2005-04-16

This was originally published online as a daily diary on a Monty Python site (some of the boring parts have been edited out in the book version).  It chronicles Eric Idle's \\"Greedy Bastard Tour\\" of Canada and America.  It is pretty interesting, although a few boring parts were left in.  A lot of what Idle writes here is quite funny, as you might expect.  But what is somewhat surprising is that at times he gets serious and pours his heart out.  The account of his friendship with George Harrison, and how Eric felt when George died, is actually quite touching.  I should note that this book is not strictly about the Greedy Bastard Tour.  There are many instances when he digresses and writes about events that happened in years past.  This book will be of the most interest to Monty Python fans, and they are probably the only ones who will buy it, anyway.	2005-04-08

This third volume in The Spirit Archives collects the comics from the second half of 1941.  Despite what another reviewer says, Will Eisner was not yet in the army, and was still writing and drawing the feature.  The Spirit would not reach it's peak until after World War II, but it was still head and shoulders above just about any other adventure strip at the time.  Will Eisner, may he rest in peace, was one of the greatest cartoonists of all time.  Highly recommended.	2005-03-29

While it doesn't quite match [[ASIN:1593072937 The Hard Goodbye]], it's a damn fine example of comics noir in it's own right.  The lead character this time around is Dwight, but fans of Marv will be pleased to know that he shows up here in a supporting role.  This story takes place prior to, and concurrently with, \\"The Hard Goodbye\\".  In fact, you can see Marv enacting some scenes from \\"The Hard Goodbye\\" in the background of panels here.  Anyway, the story is about how Dwight's ex-girlfriend Ava comes and asks him for help.  I don't want to give away the story, but it may seem a bit familiar to fans of film noir.  Despite what may seem like a predictable storyline, I loved it because it is so well told and the art is beautiful.

A large portion of the book is devoted to his first love.  The book really captures those bittersweet feelings of young love.  I could really identify with the author, since I was a \\"sensitive outsider\\" in my youth, as well.  People who are interested in comic books that are about something other than \\"guys in tights beating each other up\\" would be advised to read this.	2005-03-15

This is a reference book for [[ASIN:1401201180 The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Vol. 2]].  It helps the reader to identify the characters and references in the comic book.  For example, it will tell you who John Carter and Gullivar Jones are, and will even identify all the different races of Martians and tell you what books they came from.  Where this book comes in most handy is in regards to \\"The New Traveller's Almanac\\", which is a sort of travelogue about the League's world.  The Almanac describes hundreds of fictional locations that exist in the League's world, very few of which the average reader will have heard of.  Sure, everyone has heard of Lilliput, but who ever heard of Calejava?  Jess Nevins, that's who.  This book will identify the literary source of Calejava and practically every other location mentioned here (there are a handful that he was unable to identify).  The book also has interviews with League writer Alan Moore and League artist Kevin O'Neill.  This is an excellent reference book for fans of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.	2005-03-12

Magister Negi Magi, Vol. 3	Books	5	0	0	N	N	The Evangeline Edition	Negima is the story of Negi, a 10 year old boy wizard from Wales who is assigned to teach English at a girls middle school in Japan.  In this volume, Negi battles a vampire/witch who happens to be one of his students.  This story arc takes up the whole book, but of course there are many sub-plots also in the book.  Other developments include the introduction of a talking ermine and the revelation that one of the students is a ninja.  There are still many students that we have not gotten to know yet, so hopefully we will learn about them in future volumes.  I am thoroughly enjoying this series and I'm looking forward to reading future volumes as they are published.	2005-02-17

This time around, Negi finds out he will lose his job if his class comes in last in the big exam.  So, the worst students go to Secret Library Island, where there is rumoured to be a magic book that makes you smart.  I don't want to give away the ending, but the series would be over pretty quick if Negi lost his job.  Some different girls get highlighted this time, including the loner, the class rep and the twins.  But with 31 girls, some of them have not been developed at all yet.  Hopefully, we will get to know them all in future volumes.  So far this series has been delightful, and I'm looking forward to reading more.	2005-02-17

This is the eagerly awaited follow up series from the creator of [[ASIN:1931514941 Love Hina]].  There are certain similarities to that series, in that the lead boy often ends up in embarrassing situations with cute half naked girls.  Plus, the lead girl here, Asuna, looks a lot like Naru, the heroine of Love Hina.  But instead of a college ago boy, the hero this time is much younger.  Negi Springfield is a (almost) ten year old magician from Wales.  After graduating from magic academy, he is assigned to teach English at a girls middle school in Japan.  Many humorous complications ensue, naturally.  I liked this book a lot, but with 31 female students, readers may have a hard time keeping track of who's who as the story progresses.  Some of the girls have hardly anything to do this time around; hopefully they will be fleshed out as the series continues.  At least one of the girls appears to be a robot, but that isn't explicitly stated.  I think anyone who liked Love Hina will enjoy this book as well.	2005-02-16

A: Jamie Kellner	This book tells the story of not only the death of WCW, but the entire history of WCW.  Most wrestling fans are probably familiar with the story, but it's still an interesting read.  Plus, there were so many boneheaded mistakes made, that many fans probably forgot a lot them.  Much of this book is funny, but it's also sad in a way.  After all, a lot of people lost their jobs when WCW shut down.  And the wrestling industry was much better off with two major promotions.  Just look at how bad WWE is now, compared to how it was when WCW was around, and you can see how competition inspired them to put on a better product.  This is an entertaining book that wrestling fans will enjoy.	2005-02-15

This is an absolutely fantastic black and white graphic novel by Frank Miller, who helped revitalize the superhero genre with his versions of Batman and Daredevil.  Sin City might be described as \\"film noir\\", except for the fact that it isn't a film, it's a comic book.  But it soon will be a [[ASIN:B001R4KQDE film]]!  Frank Miller himself has co-directed the film with Robert Rodriguez, so there is a good chance it will be faithful to the comic book.  The film adapts more than one of the Sin City graphic novels, but I thought people might like to know who plays the characters from this particular book:<br /><br />Mickey Rourke plays Marv.<br />Jaime King plays Goldie.<br />Carla Gugino plays Lucille.<br />Jessica Alba plays Nancy.<br />Elijah Wood plays Kevin.<br />Rosario Dawson plays Gail.<br />Rutger Hauer plays Roark.	2005-02-06

It is the autobiography of a porn star.  It's practically review proof.  It's not exactly Pulitzer Prize material, but nobody who reads it will be expecting a literary classic.  Most people who read it will be looking for \\"dirt\\" on the porn industry and the various celebrities Jenna has met.  And there is plenty of that.  But the book also has this disclaimer: \\"Only some names and identifying features of individuals have been changed in order to preserve their anonymity and protect their innocence.  In addition, some characters are composites, and one movie title has been changed.\\"  I believe that the changed movie's title is \\"Cherry Pie\\", which is called \\"Sponge Cake\\" in the book.  But what I really want to know is: which characters are composites?  Anyway, if you are at all interested in what goes on behind the scenes in the porno industry, this book is a real eye opener.	2005-02-03

This isn't a traditional autobiography, in that it doesn't tell his life story from beginning to now.  Instead, he focuses on a handful of time periods in his life, jumping back and forth in time.  Well, Dylan's music has always been unconventional, so why shouldn't his book be the same?  The parts of his life that he does choose to tell us are very interesting, and he tells it brilliantly.  His descriptions are very evocative, and he seems to have a very detailed memory of everything that ever happened to him.  This is one of the best autobiographies ever written by an entertainer.  I should also mention that Entertainment Weekly named this book the Non-Fiction Book of the Year.  Entertainment Weekly may not be as prestigious as Publishers Weekly, but it still has to count for something.	2005-01-16

The characters are closer to the Peanuts characters we all came to know and love, although they are all younger at this point.  Two new characters were introduced in 1954, they being the legendary Pig Pen and the soon-to-be-forgotten Charlotte Braun.  Pig Pen of course is famous for being the dirtiest kid in the world.  Charlotte Braun is obscure for being a girl who talks too loud.  This is great stuff, and all Peanuts fans should get this book.	2005-01-04

This is a very complex series, so you really need to read the previous 15 volumes to understand what is going on here.  A lot of people gave up on this series long before it got to this volume, due to Dave Sim's controversial viewpoints and some often infuriating plot developments.  But I'm not going to go into what happened in previous volumes.  This particular volume consists entirely of Cerebus' last day of life.  It starts off with a dream Cerebus has, which is really Dave Sim's explanation for the Origin of Everything (this is the sort of thing that has alienated so many Cerebus readers).  Then Cerebus wakes up, and we witness the rest of his day, until he dies.  I won't give away too much, but Cerebus is a decrepit old man at this point.  Anyway, if you read the previous 15 volumes of Cerebus, I'm sure you'll want to find out how it ends.  If you haven't read Cerebus before, this isn't the place to start.	2004-12-23

(They weren't particularly well written reviews, but I digress...)  The thesis of the book is that the format of books has to change in order for books to survive.  Ms. Kirschenbaum suggests usings color text, different font sizes and other visual stimuli to make books more appealing, especially to young people.  She shows many examples of how books were more decorative before the limitations of mass production forced books into a simple black print on white paper format.  After reading the book, I am inclined to agree with her that books need to evolve in order to appeal to a greater number of people.  However, I am not as optimistic as her that books WILL change.  Book publishers seem to be very set in their ways and resistant to change.  But if this book inspires people to take a shot at \\"designer writing\\", I'm all for it.  I actually wanted to write this review in color, but Amazon wouldn't let me.	2004-12-15

And by charts I mean EVERY chart.  Information was taken from the Pop charts, the R&B charts, the Country charts, the Jazz charts, the Children's music charts and every other chart that ever appeared in Billboard magazine (including, of course, the actual Christmas music charts).  The songs are arranged by both the performers and the song titles.  So, for instance you can look up Bing Crosby to find out which of his Christmas singles and albums charted (by the way, the albums listings list all the songs that are on the albums).  Or you could look up \\"White Christmas\\", to see how many different Christmas albums that song appeared on (the answer is 232, by the way).  There is also a color section, which has beautiful reproductions of old Christmas records and their covers.  The book is very comprehensive, so since it does exactly what it sets out to do, I am giving it five stars.	2004-12-14

A group of \\"freaks\\" joined together to form a super-team. The Chief was the wheelchair bound genius leader. Robotman was a human being with his brain trapped in a robot body. Negative Man could cause a radio-energy being to leave his body at the speed of light, but had to keep his body wrapped in bandages to protect people from his radioactive skin. Elasti-Girl could grow really big or really small. (Actually, she not all that \\"freakish\\". No more so than any other super-hero, anyway). Besides being considered \\"outcasts\\", the Doom Patrol was different than other DC heroes in that they actually had personalities. Robotman and Negative Man often had arguments with each other, and they both had moments when they felt bitter about their situations. This book features Doom Patrol #s 90 to 97.  This time around we are introduced to Mento; Elasti-Girl's love interest and Garguax; the alien super-villain.  Of course, their \\"classic\\" villains General Immortus, Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man and the Brotherhood of Evil return.  I think that anyone who is a fan of Silver Age comics should get this book. While it's true that the stories aren't as \\"sophisticated\\" as today's comics, they have a charm that most of the current comics can't duplicate.	2004-10-30

But the second half of the book is dominated by Italian playboy Mario educating Emmanuelle about his philosophy of eroticism.  This is pretty pretentious stuff, and rather dull.  Mario almost makes sex seem boring.  What a windbag!  Also, the book ends rather abruptly.  It feels like there was another chapter that got left out.

I thought I knew a lot about Hulk Hogan, but the book reveals details about his life that I was not aware of.  Plus it is interesting to get Hulk's perspective on the well known events in his life.  But it gets annoying sometimes the way he puts himself over so much.  Like when he says that every kid he ever talked to about Jesus accepted Christ as his/her Savior.  Or when he claims that every one of his movies made money.  Or his outrageous claim that even though Bruno Sammartino vs Larry Zbyszko headlined \\"Showdown at Shea\\", Hulk Hogan vs Andre the Giant was the only match people really cared about.  Also, I noticed a few factual errors (Steven Spielberg didn't direct Gremlins 2).  But it is still an interesting read, and Hulk's fans should enjoy it.	2004-09-18

Well, movie director Reginald Hudlin and comic strip creator Aaron McGruder were hanging out together at the San Diego Comic Book Convention.  They were trying to come up with an idea for a movie, when Hudlin suggested the idea of his hometown of East St. Louis seceding from the United States.  They wrote a script based on that idea, but they couldn't get a movie studio to make the film.  So, rather than just let the script sit on the shelf, they decided to turn it into a graphic novel.  Rather than have McGruder draw it himself, they got the brilliant Kyle Baker to illustrate it.  So, how is the final result?  It's great, in my opinion.  It's a very funny book with great movie storyboard style illustrations.  No doubt it will seem funnier to a liberal than it would to a conservative.  But anyone who enjoys Aaron McGruder's Boondocks comic strip should also enjoy this book.	2004-09-14

It's hard to catagorize it, but I would say it's a \\"romantic comedy with lots of slapstick\\".  It continues the story of Keitaro and the girls who live at Hinata House.  You get a better idea of the individual girls personalities this time around, especially Su, who was pretty underdeveloped in the first book.  The intriguing love-hate relationship between Keitaro and Naru continues.  Will they end up together?  I would think so, but I don't know, I have only read the first two books in the series.  But you better believe I plan on reading the rest of the books and finding out.  Fans of manga comedy should really enjoy this.  I think it will have a lot of appeal to teenage girls (not that I am a teenager, or a girl, for that matter).  But of course you should read the first book in the series before you read this one.	2004-09-11

There is some really good stuff here, although not everything will be liked by everybody.  I could mention my favorites, but your taste is different than mine, so what would be the point?  If your interest in comics extends beyond superheroes, you should give this a shot.	2004-09-08

It is sort of a romantic comedy, with a lot of slapstick.  I won't describe what the book is about, because there is already a book description here.  But I will tell you that this is a lot different than any American comic books you may have read.  It has a very Japanese feel to it, with the somewhat nerdy hero practically blowing a gasket just from catching a glimpse of a girl's panties.  It should be mentioned that this book is not really appropriate for pre-teens.  Also, some people may be uncomfortable with a 19 year old hero who finds himself attracted to a 12 year old girl.  But that is just a difference between Japanese culture and American culture.  Highly recommended.	2004-08-30

In them, an old gravedigger narrates stories about the \\"Boogeyman\\".  The Boogeyman is not a physical being, but rather is the symbolic manifestation of people's fears.  The narrative structure gives ample opportunity to tell (mostly) humorous stories about human fears.  If you are familar with Sergio's other collaborations with Mark, you know what to expect.  If you only know Sergio from his work in Mad Magazine, well, this is similar to that, only longer and with more narrative structure.  Recommended to all fans of funny comic books.	2004-08-22

The stories are not part of the regular DC continuity, so the artists are allowed to do pretty much whatever they want with them.  This is not just a series of short stories, though.  The book has a framing story where 5th Dimensional imp Mr. Mxyzptlk has to defend his dimension by playing a series of games with a creature called \\"A\\".  After he gets himself disqualified, Mxyzptlk is forced to find a \\"champion\\" to play on his behalf, and he accidentally picks Superman's imperfect duplicate, Bizarro.  Mxyzptlk tries to teach Bizarro how to be a hero by showing him a bunch of comic books.  So, Bizarro draws his own comics, which are really the ones created by the aformentioned alternative cartoonists.  As for the comics themselves, well, they are different, that's for sure.  Some are funny, some are serious and some are just plain weird.  The most notorious story here is \\"Letitia Lerner, Superman's Babysitter\\", By Kyle Baker.  It was originally supposed to be in a comic called \\"Elseworlds 80-Page Giant\\", but that comic was recalled and destroyed because some people at DC got cold feet over the comic's contents.  (I don't want to give away what happens, but the story involves baby Superman having things happen to him that would kill an ordinary baby).  This is a fun book that features interesting interpretations of super-heroes.	2004-08-20

He later became better known as the creator of Shadowhawk.  This earlier work is a humor comic drawn in a cartoonish style.  The basic plot is: a Junior CPA thought his planet was going to explode (he was wrong) and shot his infant son into space in a rocket ship.  20 years later, the rocketship lands on a planet of superheroes.  So, the newly christened \\"normalman\\" tries to adjust to life as the only non-super person on the planet.  (It's sort of like Superman in reverse).  It's pretty funny stuff, that allows Valentino to takes (loving) digs at the conventions of the superhero genre.  Other comics genres also get parodied, by way of having normalman visit other planets in an attempt to return to his home planet.  Besides normalman himself, there are a number of entertaining supporting characters.  Some of the best are: Captain Everything (a Superman parody), Sgt. Fluffy (a Nick Fury parody), Sophisticated Lady (normalman's true love), The Countess of Monte Crisco (Sophisticated Lady's rival for norm's affection) and The Ultra-Conservative (norm's arch-enemy).  This is a funny comic book that I enjoyed quite a bit.	2004-08-19

This book contains all nine books in Jeff Smith's epic series Bone.  It's a real bargain, since you get the complete story at a fraction of the price you would pay if you bought all the individual books.  But aside from the price, this is simply a great comic book.  I hadn't read Bone at all before I bought this book, and now it is one of my favorite comics.  It's 1300 pages long, but once I started reading it, I didn't want to stop.  I don't want to give away much of the plot, because part of the enjoyment comes from experiencing the many twists and turns that the story takes.  But I will mention that the book is a fantasy adventure with a lot of humor.  The \\"Bone\\" title comes from the characters of the Bone cousins; big hearted Fone Bone, greedy Phoney Bone and goofy Smiley Bone.  As the book opens, the Bones have been run out of their hometown of Boneville.  The end up in the Valley, and have the adventure of their lives.  And that's all I am going to say.  I highly recommend this book.	2004-08-08

This book features the first two years and three months of the Peanuts comic strip.  It's fascinating to see the evolution of characters like Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Schroeder, Lucy, Linus, Violet, Shermy and Patty.  Other than the historical significance, the comics are quite funny.  Charles Schulz had it from the beginning, even if the characters weren't fully formed at the time.  Highly recommended.	2004-07-27

This is the final volume in the series of reprints of Sunday Li'l Abner strips.  They chose to focus on the years when Frank Frazzetta was drawing the majority of the Sunday strips.  I wish they would have printed the entire run of the series, but that's their decision.  Anyway, Li'l Abner was a great comic strip for most of it's run, and this time period was no exception.

I have be honest and admit that in my opinion Li'l Abner is the greatest American comic strip of all time.  So, my opinion is not exactly unbiased.  Naturally, I loved this book.  Many people have the opinion that the strip went downhill after Li'l Abner and Daisy Mae got married.  That may be true, but it was a slow descent down that hill, and the strip was still great in the mid 1950s.  The scripts are hilarious and the Frazetta art is beautiful (although drawn in the style of Al Capp, not his own style).  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in classic American comic strips.	2004-07-02

All three stories here are about Englishmen discovering lost civilizations, but they are not at all repetitive.  I found the character of Ayesha(&quot;She&quot;) to be one of the most fascinating female characters I ever read about.  I could go on and on about the merits of these books, but i will just say that if you like adventure novels (and you don't have a predjudice against books written in a somewhat dated style), you should enjoy these stories.	2004-05-25

This book reprints the first eight adventures of the original Teen Titans.  The original lineup was Robin, Kid Flash, Aqualad and Wonder Girl.  The three boys were &quot;kid sidekicks&quot; to members of the Justice League, but Wonder Girl is a different story.  You see, the editor of the comic felt that the group needed a female member, so he looked at DC's comic books and the only teenage heroine he could find was Wonder Girl.  But he must not have looked at the comics too closely, or he would have realized that Wonder Girl stories were actually flashbacks to when Wonder Woman herself was a girl.  So, here was Wonder Woman's teenage self in the Teen Titans at the same time as her adult self was in the Justice League.  Eventually, they sorted things out and got around to explaining who THIS Wonder Girl was, but it took a few years.  Anyway, that's quite enough background information.  As for the comics themselves, they don't exactly hold up that well.  They read like they were written by a middle aged man who didn't understand teenagers (which they were).  The slang in the comics was about ten years out of date.  I don't think kids in the mid-'60s were still saying &quot;daddio&quot;.  These stories are really corny.  Plus, they had the worst villains.  There were forgettable losers like Mr. Twister, the Separated Man, Ding-Dong Daddy Dowd and the Ant.  This book can only be recommended for nostalgia reasons.	2004-02-29

This is a funny book about the worst moments in professional wrestling.  It is a spinoff of the website of the same name.  The main difference between the two is that on the website individual crap is looked at, while here in the book, the various crappy aspects of wrestling are strung together to form a larger story.  What I mean by that is that the chapters will usually focus on what happened in WCW or the WWF during a particular time period.  There are a few exceptions, like a chapter all about the Ultimate Warrior and one about Hulk Hogan's &quot;acting&quot; career.  If you are the type of person who likes to laugh at the &quot;worst&quot; of anything, you should get some chuckles out of this book.	2004-02-25

A group of &quot;freaks&quot; joined together to form a super-team.  The Chief was the wheelchair bound genius leader.  Robotman was a human being with his brain trapped in a robot body.  Negative Man could cause a radio-energy being to leave his body at the speed of light, but had to keep his body wrapped in bandages to protect people from his radioactive skin.  Elasti-Girl could grow really big or really small. (Actually, she not all that &quot;freakish&quot;.  No more so than any other super-hero, anyway).  Besides being considered &quot;outcasts&quot;, the Doom Patrol was different than other DC heroes in that they actually had personalities.  Robotman and Negative Man often had arguments with each other, and they both had moments when they felt bitter about their situations.  This book features the Doom Patrol's first ten comics.  Besides meeting the heroes, you will also meet their legendary enemies; General Immortus, The Brotherhood of Evil, and Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man.  (Yes, that last one has a goofy name, but he's still a pretty cool villain.)  I think that anyone who is a fan of Silver Age comics should get this book.  While it's true that the stories aren't as &quot;sophisticated&quot; as today's comics, they have a charm that most of the current comics can't duplicate.	2004-02-20

It is an improvement over the [[ASIN:1593070942 first one]], as we get to know the old characters better, and interesting new characters are introduced.  Creator Mike Mignola's Kirbyesque artwork is terrific, and this time he handles the writing himself (the first graphic novel was scripted by John Byrne).  I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but I will explain that Hellboy is a paranormal investigator who appears to be a demon.  This book is dedicated to Dracula, which should give you a clue as to what he encounters this time.  This book should be especially appealing to people who like [[ASIN:B000UZDO5I The X-Files]] or [[ASIN:B000AQ68RI Buffy The Vampire Slayer]], but I would encourage anyone who is a fan of sophisticated comic books to check it out.	2004-02-13

But things go downhill when a group of dead punk rockers show up and try to get Dee Dee to join a human sacrificing Satanic cult.  None of the characters in this book act believably, not even the Dee Dee character.  I am a big fan of Dee Dee, but this book revels in his worst traits, which are his misanthropy and self hated.  This is a very unpleasant book, which most people will not enjoy.	2004-02-11

But the vulgarities here are appropritate to the characters, so I have no objections to them.  Louis Bayard does a fine job of evoking the London of 1860, and I think a lot of people will enjoy this book.

The second book contains Alan Moore's scripts for the comic book series.  If you enjoyed the comic book series and can't get enough of it, this book is for you.

In my opinion, Li'l Abner was the greatest comic stip of all time.  The strip was fantastic during the 1950s, so you can't go wrong here.  It seems like this was released because of the Frazetta connection, but the art looks pretty much like all other Li'l Abner art.

First of all, this is not a sequel to Gary Wolf's previous book, [[ASIN:0345303253 Who Censored Roger Rabbit?]].  It would be pretty difficult to have a sequel to that book.  I don't want to give away the plot of that book, but I will mentioned that the original title of it was \\"Who Killed Roger Rabbit?\\".  Instead, this is a sequel to the film [[ASIN:B00007AJGH Who Framed Roger Rabbit?]], sort of.  When I say \\"sort of\\", I mean that Wolf based the characters on their depictions in the movie, but he included some of the plot elements from his first book that were not included in the movie.  For example, Wolf has toons talking by forming dialogue balloons such as you see in comic strips, which they didn't do in the movie.  So the book doesn't really work as a sequel to either the previous book or the movie.  However, taken on it's own merits, it is fairly enjoyable as an independent work.  It's a decent parody of a hard boiled detective novel, set in a world where humans and toons coexist.  I especially enjoyed the relationship between Eddie Valiant and Jessica Rabbit's twin sister.  Fans of Roger Rabbit should get a few chuckles out of this.	2003-10-12

It features the contents of the out of print books [[ASIN:0345479386 American Splendor]] and [[ASIN:0385240732 More American Splendor]].  Obviously, this was released to capitalize on the publicity that the American Splendor [[ASIN:B0000U0X20 film]] is getting.  Well, if the movie inspires people to search out the comics of Harvey Pekar, that is a good thing.  This is great stuff.  Harvey has a way of making ordinary life seems interesting.  I think if you saw the movie and liked it, you will also dig this book.	2003-09-27

Boy, it is almost nothing like [[ASIN:B000FFJYBG the movie]].  Aside from basic plot of \\"three witches in the town of Eastwick fall under the influence of a new man in town\\", the book and the movie have almost nothing in common. I don't want to give away too much of the book's plot, but the witches here are more promiscuous than in the movie.  Just about every married man in town has an affair with one of the witches.  Anyway, the book is a \\"good read\\", as they say, and you will probably enjoy it if you are not offended by sexual content.	2003-09-20

I was outraged reading about the way she was used and abused as a child.  I have a lot of sympathy and even admiration for her.  She was able to overcome a miserable past and become a moderate success in show business.  She has an interesting story to tell, and you may enjoy reading it.  It is not that well written, but then again she is not a professional writer.	2003-08-31
US	49635896	RLY4ICYFFM9ZB	0809001608	598990781	The Treasure of the Sierra Madre	Books	5	5	8	N	N	Hidden treasure	I decided to read this book because I was a fan of [[ASIN:B00003CXD5 the movie]].  I had actually been unaware that it was a book, but when I saw a copy of it for sale, I decided to buy it.  I just finished reading it, and it's a great book.  A great cautionary tale about the evils of greed. It also gives a vivid description of what Mexico was like in the early 1930s, and what prospecting was like.  They should be teaching this book in school.	2003-08-27

Machiavelli does make some good points about politics, but his writing style failed to hold my interest.  I don't have much else to say about this book.  I apologize if this review was not helpful to you.	2003-08-19

He led a fascinating life and he tells all about it, both the good and the bad.  He pulls no punches, whether he is talking about people he liked (Vince McMahon, Nikolai Volkoff, Bobo Brazil), or people he hated (Buddy Rogers, Mil Mascaras, Ivan Putski).  The book also includes sidebars written by people who knew Blassie, giving their own accounts of events in Blassie's life.  This book is wonderful account of the life of one of the squared circle's all time greats.  I said it before and I'll say it again, his name was Blassie, King of Men.	2003-08-09

He doesn't try to make himself out to be a great guy, and he is honest about bad behavior on his part.  The book is written conversationally and I, for one, could hear Roddy's voice in my head while I was reading.  The only disappointment to me was that it should have been longer.  He didn't talk much about his time in WCW, and there were other topics that he didn't spend much time on.  Fans of '80s wrestling should really enjoy this book.  By the way, I met Roddy at a book signing, and he was super nice.  He was gracious and friendly to everyone, and happy to talk to everyone and pose for pictures.  Really a class act.	2003-08-02

Some of these books are famous, some of them are obscure. Jess Nevins has done an excellent job of tracking down the books, so now you can know the history of these characters, many of which have been forgotten one hundred years later.  For instance, I don't think too many people knew who &quot;Rose Coote&quot;, the headmistress of the girl's school, was.  Well, in this book, you can learn the history of that character, as well as every other character who is so much as mentioned in the comic.  By the way, I met Jess at the San Diego Comic Con, and he said he is working on an Encyclopedia about the League.  From what he said, it will be around a thousand pages long, so start saving your money now.	2003-07-23

With this series, he has come up with another winner.  As many of you have no doubt heard, it features a team of heroes (and villains) from Victorian fiction.  It is all brilliantly written, and Kevin O'Neill's artwork compliments the writing perfectly.  This is a must buy for any serious fan of the comic book genre.  I also think that many people who don't normally read comics will like it, too.	2003-07-23

Was it worth the wait?  I think so.  There were a lot of unanswered questions from the [[ASIN:B002TVQFLQ last book]], many of which are answered here.  Of course, this book brings up many new unanswered questions.  I won't go into the plot of the book, because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it yet.  This book is actually pretty much review proof.  If you read the other four books, you are gonna want to read this one.  And if you haven't read the other four books, you shouldn't start with this one, because you will be very confused about what is happening.	2003-07-08

The real treasures here are the rare documents and memorabilia from the Graceland archives.  There are a lot of things that will be of interest to the Elvis fan.  Oh, and there is also an audio CD featuring interviews with Elvis.  The interviews are worth listening to once, but I don't think many people would want to listen to them multiple times.	2003-07-05

It plays out as a mystery of sorts.  A lawyer friend of Jekyll tries to find out what the relationship is between the respectable Dr Jekyll and the lowlife Mr Hyde.  It is not revealed until near the end of the story that they are in fact the same man.  Of course, nowadays everyone is aware of that before they have even read this story.  Naturally, a lot of the suspense of the story is lost due to this.  Still, this story became a classic for a reason and is well worth a read.  And it's short too, for you kids looking for a short book to read for a book report.  There are two other suspense stories by Stevenson included here, too.  These two are not classics, but they are also enjoyable.	2003-06-27

Here we have some great examples of his masterwork, Plastic Man.  Plastic Man and his sidekick Woozy Winks are two of the greatest characters of the Golden Age of comics.  Jack Cole's odd outlook on life, and his sometimes dark sense of humor, make these among the best of the superhero comics of the era.  Highly recommended to superhero fans, especially those who don't them too seriously.	2003-06-22

The book differs from the movies in that it is told entirely from the point of view of the daughter who ends up in her mother's body.  It is a good story for kids, with a lot of funny moments.	2003-06-17

Except of course, unlike the JLA, the Avengers had disagreements with each other.  The Hulk actually quit the group in the second issue and never rejoined.  There are a lot of goofy things in here, like Avengers suddenly using powers they never had before, and never had again afterward.  Overall though, these stories from a simpler era are a lot of fun.  I would recommend this book to super-hero fans.	2003-06-15

These are the stories that started the &quot;Marvel Age of Comics&quot;.  Really good stuff.  Lee and Kirby changed the way superheroes were presented.  Before this, superheroes didn't have personal problems, or ever argue with each other.  Great characters here, in entertaining stories.  Highly recommended.	2003-05-31

Here we have all six issues of the Incredible Hulk's first series.  It's a fun series.  It holds up pretty well, other than the commie smashing.  You can see how they were struggling with how to present the Hulk in the early days.  They change his color, his means of transformation, his powers and his personality all within these six issues.  The hardcover format with glossy pages is an excellent presentation of this material.  If you can afford it, it's a good deal.  It's still cheaper than buying the original issues.	2003-05-22
