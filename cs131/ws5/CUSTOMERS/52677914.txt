In Russia Yuri worked in a chemical plant that produced Anthrax, and thus he knows how to make it. He teams up with two white supremest fire fighters, who provide him with the financial means and equipment to produce Anthrax. The three plan to release their weapon of bioterror in the federal building and at Yuri's instance in Central Park.<br />Before the group tries mass terror, Yuri tests his Anthrax on a rug dealer. When the rug dealer dies his autopsy is performed by medical examiner Jack Stapleton. Stapleton refuses to belive that the rug dealer contracted Anthrax from some rugs he has imported and invistagtes further. In the process he encounters Yuri and his friends and the novel becomes the classic tale of good versus evil.<br />The novel is certainly engrossing. This is in part due to the story and in part due to the similarites it has to current events. Cook also does a good job of making you realize what can be done with a weapon such as Anthrax.	2001-11-04

These are stories about trying to find and maintain your identies, and not about finding murders or kidnappers.<br />The first story &quot;City of Glass&quot; is about a writer, Quinn, who has lost his family and seems to be lost without a purpose.  One day he recive a phone call for by mistake, the call is for a detective Paul Auster.  Out of interest Quinn decides to say he is Paul Auster and takes the case.  Quinn gets so involved in the case he loses everything else in his life.  His only lifeline during this time is a red notebook that he makes notes about the case in.  It is in this notebook that he tries to figure out who he is.<br />The second story, &quot;Ghosts,&quot; is meant to be like an old dective story, a la Dashell Hammett. It has a very surreal quality about it none of the charcters have real names, they are named after colors.  The story centers around Blue who is hired to watch Black.  All Black does is sit in his apartment and write.  Just like Quinn in the first story Blue loses his himself in the case and in Black.  The question is who hired Blue and why?<br />The third story, &quot;The Locked Room,&quot; is about a man who is never given a name, and his childhood friend Fanshawe.  Fanshawe has disappeared leaving his wife, child, and his unpublished work.  He leaves the task of deciding what to do with the unpublished work to his friend.  As his friend goes about getting the work published he becomes closer to Fanshawe's wife and son.  The friend and Fanshawe's wife finally marry.  The friend's troubles begin when he is asked to write a book about Fanshawe's life.  He becomes so absorbed in Fanshawe's life he almost loses himself in it.  Can Fanshawe's friend save himself and his life before it becomes lost in Fanshawe's.<br />Each character in each story struggles with who he is.  Auster plays with his role as a writer in these stories.  In the first story he puts himself in by name, and at the end of the last story he tries to explain why he wrote this collection of stories.<br />Overall this is collection is well worth the read.  It is full of imagery and well written.  I highly recomend this book for anyone who is looking for a book that will make them think, but is a quick read.he first story he puts himself in by name, and at the end of the last story he tries to explain why he wrote this collection of stories.<br />Overall this is collection is well worth the read.

I have never been more satisfied with one of my purchases in my life.  I was unable to put this book down from the time I started it.  This book has it all good writing, great characters, murder, romance, and some very immoral villians.<br />The plot line of the story is about the nazi party's attempt to rebuild itself.  One of their most important tasks is to build themselves the perfect leader.  These people will stop at nothing to accomplish this task no matter how many people die in the process.  To say more about the plot would destroy it.<br />All I can say is buy this book.  Even if you do not consider yourself a thriller fan this book will captivate you.	2001-11-04

Goverment officals must keep the cleanup out of the public's eyes.  Preston gives the readers graffic discriptions of what Ebola can do.  These descriptions are so scary the reader will wish the story were fiction, but it's not.  This part of the book is terrific.  Preston's writing is strong and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.<br />The second part of this book is Preston's account of his journey to the Kitchum cave.  The Kitchum cave is rumored to be the source of of diseases such as Ebola and AIDS.  This part of the book is not as enjoyable as the first part.  It is filled with details of cave walls, and many other details that make the essay a very slow read.  It is also somewhat dated since the Kitchum cave although a one point was considered a hot zone it has shown no evidence of disease.<br />Overall this book is worth the read.  The first part of the book is a great read that rivals fiction horror stories.  The second part of the book although not as interesting is still worth a read since Preston did take a chance in visting a hot zone.	2001-10-29

It is full of history and imagery wih a few gods and immortals added to the mix.  The story begins in ancient Bohemia with King Alobar attempting to find a way to avoid his impending death sentence at the hands of his subjects.  He escapes his death with the help of his favorite wife Wren, and goes in search of immortality, which he finds.  The rest of the story is about his life for the next 1,000 years.<br />During this time he meets a dying greek god Pan, several Nymphs, and a new wife.  To say more about the story would spoil it.<br />This book is about Robbins view of life and relgion.  Robbins uses symbols such as beets, and perfume to symbolize diffrent aspects life.  These symbols are fun and leave the reader thinking long after they have finished reading the book.  If you are not a Robbins this fan this book will convert you.	2001-10-26
US	52677914	R1WGBE6WSCXASW	0553580221	284106836	False Memory	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Good premise, but messy story.	The best thing about this novel is the concept, mind control through hypnotisim.  Koontz goes further than most with this concept.  In addition to having his villian control people with hypnosis he has his villian, Dr. Ahriman, implant phobias in his patients minds.<br />That said one of the big problems with this novel is it is very drawn out.  For example Koontz takes the first 200 pages to get through a few hours of time.  In that space Koontz harps on details that become boring and add nothing to the story, including what people ate, and long decriptions of dog walking.  These laboress detailed passages occur throughout the novel, the result being that they slow down the story and confuse the reader.<br />The other big problem with this novel is it is messy.  There are to many extrenous details and charcters.  For example, for the first half of the novel the reader belives that Dr. Ahriman is acting alone, however late in the novel the reader learns that he is affilited with an institute.  It is never clear what this institutes purpose is, and why Dr. Ahriman is really affilated with them.  The institute is totally useless, espically since the reader learns that Ahriman's behavior with the main charcters is really based on his own agenda and has nothing to do with the institue after all.<br />This is a novel that would have been helped by an editor.  However it is still an interesting concept and a good thriller when Koontz isn't adding extra materail.	2001-01-28

In this story Dunne fictionalizes the  Martha Moxley murder and shows his strengths as a storyteller.  Here Dunne shows he can balance plot as well as charcter development.<br />This story is told from the point of veiw of Harrison Burns.  When Harrison was a teenager he saw his friend Constant Bradley murder the girl next door.  Constant's family buys Harrison's silence through the years by paying his college tution and sending him abroad.<br />However as the years go on Harrison finds it harder to live with what he has seen.  These feelings cause the demise of his marriage and general self loathing.  Harrison is forced to face off with the Bradley's when they invite him to their home to ask Harrison to write a book about Constant's life.<br />Along with Harrison's dilema Dunne tells the story of the demise of a family.  The skill with which Dunne tells both stories make this book well worth reading.  The other to reason to read it is of course, affairs, family battles, and good gossip.	2001-01-25

For the most part the novel had an enjoyable story line but it lacked any passion.  This is a problem because the premise of the story is a  passionate affair.<br />The only way the reader knows that Olympia and Haskell have feelings for each other is the narrator tells them.  It almost comes as a shock when the Haskell and Olympia wind up in bed together after only a few encounters.  This lack of passion stems from the reader not really getting a glimpse at either main charcters thoughts.<br />The enjoyable part of this novel comes fromt the actual story.  The descriptions of place and time.  The reader gets a real sense of life at the turn of the century and peoples roles in day to day life.  I also enjoyed the ending, it was not what I expected but I really enjoyed it.	2001-01-15

This is a terrific gothic style story.<br />In addition to great  wiriting I loved the charcters even the murderer was interesting.  I also  loved the setting.  I am a New Yorker and loved reading a novel set in 19th  century NY.<br />The one thing I did not like about this book was the ending.  The end of this story leaves somes very important questions unanswered.  It  seems Carr got tired of writing the story and wanted to wrap it up as fast  as possible.  This does not make for a very satisfying ending.<br />On the  whole I would recomend this book to anyone who wants to read a good mystery  story with good writing.	2000-07-08

Rowiling is really perfecting her craft.  This is the first time Rowling gives the reader some insight into Potter's parents and how they died.  For the first time Harry begins to  understand where he came from and what happened to his parents and how is  like them.  Harry is also growing up and willing to and gaining more self  confidence such as preforming difficult spells.<br />This really is the most  complete story so far.  The plot moves along nicely, and the charcters are  developing what they have been.  I highly recomend this book.	2000-07-07

Harry once again is faced with his nemince Voldermort, and must save himself and his friends from his evil.  All the great characters from the first novel are  back.<br />What I noticed most with this book is how clever Rowling is.

The first seemed more exciting.	2000-07-07

I am an adult and picked up this book because everyone was talking about it.  For once I was not disappointed by the hype.  Although this book is very simple minded it still intrests adults because of how well crafted and  magical it is.<br />I think that is what appealed to me the most about this  story is how vivid the descriptions were and how much they made me want to  see all these places.  To bad Hogwarts doesn't really exist I would love to  see it.<br />I loved all the magical beasts, the creation of the specail  sport quiditch.  I commend Rowling on how she has created this world  without going overboard.  She uses her charcters to keep the book grounded  in reality.  Harry, Ron, and Hermoine suffer through all the anxieties of  school and life, of course it is wizard school but it still seems real.  The other way she grounds her story is to show the Muggle world and how  charcters live differently in it.<br />The one complaint I do have is that  everything seems to black and white.  The lines between good and evil are  to clearly draw, there is very little grey.  However, I think that is  because this book is written for a younger audience.  On the whole this is  a really good book and well worth the read no matter what your age is.	2000-07-05

It is like reading the screen play to the movie.  It seems the book was taken word for word and put on the screen.<br />I read the book hopping to get more insight into the charcters,  but I didn't get it.  There is zero character development and very little  suspense.  This is a horror novel, I think the children's book Where the  Wild Things are scared me more.  Levin's writting is so flat it does not  build any suspense.<br />At least in the movie there is it some suspense.	2000-07-05

Thank god  Hollywood has some taste, I have heard nothing about plans to make this  into a movie.<br />This book had one chance to be interesting.  At the end  of the book there is a chance the world could be destroyed.  Instead of  giving a real resolution to this problem Levin choses a cop out ending  which destroys the first book in the process.<br />My only consulation is that  I did not buy this book.

The writing was excellent and the charcters real.<br />I always admire writers who came create three dimensional charcters, and Pilcher  does just that.  Penlope's has three children, and she does not get along  well with two of them, Nacy and Noel.  These children are money hungry and  think their mother owes them more than she has already given them.  However  Pilcher makes it clear that Penlope loves all her children and the reader  winds up having some sympathy for them.<br />The novel manges to come full  circle and charm the reader.  It is clear that Oliva, the daughter Penlope  gets along with best, will become like her mother.  The manner in which  their lives parelle each other is the central focus of the novel and charms  the reader.  A great summer read.	2000-07-04

She is able to deliver the details of the crime commited but not make the whole thing seem to dry.  The reader winds up feeling sympathy for the victims in this case,  Cheryl, her sons, and all the other lives that Brad ruined.<br />Rule also is  careful to make sure the reader does not hate Brad.  She does this by  painting a full picture of the man.  Yes he was dishonest and a slim, but  Rule shows the reader how he got this way.  Brad's father taught him to  hate women and his mother didn't help anything telling her son that he was  the reason she got cancer.<br />The story is well told and engaging.

I read him all the time in Vanity Fair and have read a few of his novels, so when I heard that he had written about the OJ trial I rushed to read it.  However, this book unlike his  other novels do not tell the story of the crime and the trial, it is a name  dropping session.  Dunne reports all the parties his fictional counter part  Gus Bailey is invited to and who he sits next to.<br />Worse still is the fact  that this book is an outline of the book he was going to write about the  Mendez trial.  A several points during the story he writes about the  chapter Gus has just written for his book about the Mendez's brothers.  I  wish he had written the book about the Mendez it probably would have been a  better book.	2000-06-30

No wonder Stephen King likes Little's novels so much, they must remind them of his.  The basic premis of this novel is a rip off of the Shining.  In otherwords a family goes to a place and the father is taken over by  evil.  In the Shining it was a hotel here it was the evil spirt of a town.  The parelle's don't end there in both novels the target of the father's  rage is his family.<br />The Town also borrowed from other authors.  The  idea that the town becomes evil after dark is reminscent of Phil Rickman's  Curfew.  Lastly the daughter feeding the home of the evil spirit is  reminescent of the second Harry Potter novel.<br />As if this weren't bad  enough the parts of the novel that are orginal do not make it worth  reading.  None of the characters are likeable and none of their actions  belivable.  The mother and father move their family to the town after  winning the lottery.  The big question is why?  The reason given is they  want to be happy.  How can the father expect to find happiness in a town  where he grew up but was not really happy.  The children behave like  brat's.  In the case of the oldest daughter, she was apparently the perfect  child before the family moved but then become the child from hell in the  town, oh please!<br />Worse yet several relgions get mixed up in this mess of  a novel, making an already confusing story more conviluded.  Skip this book  and read the Shining there is no comparision.	2000-06-29

Grandma Mazur has to be the funniest charcter in this story.  The scene where she plays with her grand daughter's gun had me in stiches.  I don't think that I have ever  laughed that hard at any other scene in a book.  The story of Stephanie  is great to.  I like the way that she is not portrayed as a proffesional in  the business of bounty hunting but rather a woman who falls into the  proffesion because she needs the money.  She makes the mistakes most  amatures would make, but she does wind up being the hero, thus becoming a  strong heroin.  This is a must read for anyone who enjoys their mystery  stories with a does of humor.  I enjoyed this so much that I intend to read  the rest of the books in this series.	2000-06-20

His struggle as he renters the world that he left after his divorce  is a powerful story.  The scenes where he confronts people he once knew in  his old life are well written.  They are written in such a way that the  reader understands Luke's struggle, very few writers can write like  that.<br />The problem with this novel, however, is that the bulk of the novel  is about the case Luke takes on.  This part of the novel is non belivable.  There are to many holes in the story and the conclusion of this tale is  rushed and less belivable than the rest of the story.<br />On the whole I  would not recomend this book the good scenes with Luke are outweighed by a  dull unbelivable court case.	2000-06-06

If you are new to King start with Bag of Bones not this one it  is likely to turn you off to King.

This book includes  gothic, midevil, and trancesdental styles.

I read all of Judy Blume's books when I was kid and enjoyed them, so when this came out in paperback I thought I'd try it.<br />Sadly, this book  reminded me of Are You There God it's me Margret, with more sex.  If Judy  Blume really wants to write an adult book she has to do more than just  throw in some sex to make it adult.  She needs to challange her readers,  this book challanges teens not adults!	1999-07-08

However I was extremly dissapointed in the book.  It takes the author foreve to put Maddux and Enihorn together, and when he  finally does he only leaves them together for a hundred pages or so.<br />What the author seems to focus on is Enihorn's philosphies and  promiscuity.  This gets extremly tedious and boring.<br />I give the book  three stars because it did give some intresting insight into who Holly was.  The miniseries made her seem so sweet and inconnent and the book really  described her.  That was interesting.	1999-07-08

It took me several days to read the first hundred pages but after that I read the rest of the book in two days.  This is a nice departure from the Spenser novels,  with none of the characters seeming like the Spenser characters, so it has  a flavor all its own.<br /><br />In his dedecation Parker says this story is about  fathers and sons and while this is true it is about so much more.  This  novel has so many layers to it and will make an impact on you for days  after you finish it.	1999-03-10

Dominick is a well balanced character and his stories ring true  to life.  Lamb wrote this book in such a way that he made it easy to relate  to Dominick and his trails, he succeded.  Please read this book you will be  glad you did.	1999-02-18

Her constant self pity drove me up a wall.  Although Lamb hopes to make her a sympathtic character he makes her an annoying one.  Skip this book and read I Know This Much is True, it is a much better book.	1999-02-18

This story is fast paced and intresting.  The characters are well developed and interesting.  It is one of the few books  that I have read where the situations and characters seem true to life.  I  would highly recommend it.  This is DeMille at his best.	1999-02-16

I like DeMille because his characters and well developed and true to life.  The characters in this book are truly under developed and dull.  In fact in the third part of the book there is almost  no character development it is just a long trail with the same story told  several diffrent ways.<br />I waited for this book to pick up and be the  usual fast paced DeMille I love, but it never did.  Skip this and read The  Gold Coast or The Generals Daughter instead.  They are better reads.	1999-02-16

Oprah picks books of people who have everything going wrong for them and then they somehow rise above it.  This is another such story and I'm getting tired of them.  Enough with  the soul searching novels with happy endings.	1999-02-16

I love Alice Hoffman but think this is the worst book I have ever read by her.  There are so many refrences to food and stupid ones that it reads like a bad Julia Childs cookbook, and the only magic in this book is omens.  Omens like swans and black cats, a bad Anne Rice.  Aside from this the  story is weak and without a point.  Where is the Hoffman I enjoy?	1998-11-09

That is easy to say because nothing is ever  clearly stated it is eluded to.  If the point of this book is that Clinton,  or Stanton, as he is called in the book messed up every life he ever  touched I didn't need a book to find that out it I and most people already  know that.  I gave this book two stars because the one good charcter in  this story is Libby and she is entitled to the two stars.	1998-10-24
