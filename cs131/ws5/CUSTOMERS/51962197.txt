I'm afraid that many probably leave their research at that.  They are surely left at a loss; if they read THIS book, they might begin to understand the war, at least as it was seen by the &quot;everyman&quot; author, Herr Bidermann.<br />We follow the author through his role as gunner/team leader with a Pak 37 AT gun in the Crimea, then onto the Northern Theatre, his subsequent promotion and decoration, and his travails in the Courland Pocket. We end, in the Epilogue, as the author is freed from his 1,000 days as a prisoner in Soviet Russia, having been exposed to tank fire, snipers, and the horrible randomness of artillery, and having felt, if for a fleeting moment, the mortal terror of combat, the exhilaration of survival, and the weariness of the time between.<br />The book is concise, to the point, and full of details that provide the reader great insight into the life of the soldier.  As an American, I truly appreciate the understanding I have gained from this book, and feel that my own children should read IN DEADLY COMBAT, both to entertain and to learn. For far too long, Americans have seen the war from the perspective of a John Wayne flick; this book will show you that ALL of us are human, no matter the color of our uniform, and might, if its contents are carefully considered, help you truly feel the horror and evil that is war.	2001-07-20

This is an adaptation of the Joel Chandler Harris Uncle Remus stories, focusing on those containing the Brer Rabbit character. The stories are delightful, and will be a joy to any (I also heartily recommend buying a complete set for reading aloud), but the tales are drawn directly from the heart and soul of America (there are no raccoons and bears in Africa, anyway...sheesh).	2001-07-18

That said, this is really good pulp sci-fi.  It's a fast read (2 hours or less), with a moving story, interesting premise, and good characters.  I thought the ending was a bit bizarre, (and I'm DYING to read the hardcover ending that everyone has so-far panned) and could well be the weakest part of the book, but I didn't mind. It was a nice mental diversion, and probably something I'll re-read on some other summer afternood with nothing to do.<br />If you enjoyed Alan Cole and Chris Bunch's STEN series, you'll probably like this. It's basically military sci-fi, with plenty of sexual imagery thrown in for good measure.  High-tech tanks and other weaponry are well described for the enthusiast, and the action is pretty quick in coming (most of it actually occurs in a virtual environment called the Dream World).  The protagonist is a wry, worldly fellow with more-than-average mental skills (a common formula for this genre), and is easy to like.  The book lulls a bit toward the end, with a short pick-up and a final let-down. You won't care. Read it; it's not supposed to be high art.	2001-06-21

This book, however, although a classic by any standard, just doesn't do much for me. <br />I must agree with an earlier reviewer who found Max to be a snotty monster. Sure, it's supposed to make a point, but it seems that, rather than come to some internal resolution that changes his behavior, Max is instead rewarded for his awful attitude. Yes, yes, I get it, but it doesn't mean that your kids will.  This is easily the sort of book that typically wins Caldecott medals: something that adults get excited about, but something that just doesn't do much for kids.<br />Buy it if you must, but buy it for the art.	2001-05-17

I must agree with an earlier reviewer, as I am also quite pleased to see snakes portrayed in a manner that deviates from the evil or sinister.  VERDI is fun and beautiful, a delight to read and see for all ages. Artistically, VERDI easily compares to Ms. Cannon's earlier STELLALUNA (and, I think, surpasses it due to its vivid color).  <br />Although compelling, the story is not quite up to STELLALUNA's par, but it does delight: Young Verdi is interested only in fun and frolic, and does not understand the lethargy of his big, green elders.  He seeks to keep his youthful yellow color and avoid the stagnation that the adult python appears to undergo as it matures.  His vain attempts conclude with the realization that youth and vibrance is all inside.<br />VERDI is wonderful, and should be an addition to your child's library.  In addition, of course, to STELLALUNA.	2001-05-17

The artwork is, of course, wonderful, brilliant and full of vibrant color. The story, however, attempts to illustrate the difficult topic of homelessness, not the typical subject of a child's story. Although I must applaud this attempt, in all honesty, the story is just not terribly interesting nor compelling.  My own daughter found it rather boring, particularly in comparison with STELLALUNA or VERDI.<br />As evidenced by earlier reviews, it is apparent that some readers are confused by the use of the mythical Fuzzhead. It's an interesting deviation from the natural world of Ms. Cannon's other protagonists, but it seems rather artificial and strange, although it was necessary in order to enter the human world in which the story takes place. Personally, I don't have a problem with the Fuzzheads, but I didn't really find them appealing. Neither did my daughter.<br />Simply put, you may well love this book, but my family has not added it to our library, being content to allow the public library to keep it for us. :)	2001-05-17

My three-year-old has had this book since birth, and has loved it since day one, asking for it to be read over and over. <br />The story: We follow the young fruit-bat, Stellaluna, through her ordeal of becoming lost and her subsequent upbringing by a family of birds. The resultant bat-bird behavior confuses Stellaluna, but will delight your child with its absurdity. The story contains good conflict resolution, as Stellaluna regains her bat identity and her family, something sure to comfort and teach your child.<br />For further entertainment, I highly recommend Ms. Cannon's book, VERDI ( a similar tale about a green python; wonderfully written and well-illustrated), as well as the CD-ROM edition of STELLALUNA produced by Living Books (one of the few really GOOD CD-ROMs for children).	2001-05-17

Although not quite STELLALUNA or VERDI, Ms. Cannon excels with CRICKWING, the story of an injured cockroach-turned-sculptor. The book, as all of Ms. Cannon's books, is vibrant and beautiful, and a welcome addition to my own daughter's library.<br />The story: we follow the injured Crickwing through his own torments, his release in art (sculpting food) and subsequent personal growth when he turns tormentor to some leaf cutter ants.  His eventual acension to savior of the ant colony (from Army ants) resolves the conflict (both internal and external) in a way sure to delight and comfort your child.<br />CRICKWING, although not the best book (by Ms. Cannon, or otherwise), is sure to delight fans of STELLALUNA or roaches (see the movie Joe's Apartment).	2001-05-17

The story of the little town that gets its food from the sky is certain to draw in the most jaded or adult reader. It is silly and entertaining and never, ever tiresome or simple.<br />Simply put, this book is a must-buy and sure to be a classic on your bookshelf; as another reviewer said: it's delicious!	2001-05-17

Recognizing this deficiency, I recently read CATCH 22 for the first time, and found it wonderfully comic, yet simultaneously dark and frightening in its implications.<br />Intended as a scathing satire of war and the military, CATCH 22 is firmly rooted in the bizarre.  The characters are delightful in their insanity (also evidenced by their names, i.e., Colonel Korn, Major Major Major Major), and each portrays some aspect of the horrible side of human nature (Nately's sad naivety, the gnawing self-loathing of Major Major), mostly to the total exclusion of any happier traits. With such a cast, thrown into the confusion of World War II, CATCH 22 can only be a strange tale. Personally, it reminded me of the sort of black comedy that leaves you feeling dazed afterwards (for movie lovers, think NIGHT SHIFT), reeling from the confusion and horror of it all.<br />It elicits strong emotions -- frustration and anger not the least of them -- which I suspect was the author's real intention.  I often wonder why books touted as &quot;classic&quot; or &quot;great&quot; must be so bizarre. CATCH 22 is not necessarily easy to read, and it seems that only adds to the praise it receives. Perhaps CATCH 22's ability to make the reader a part of the confused, rambling story is based firmly in this bizarreness.  <br />Personal hint: read this book twice.  You'll catch much, much more the second time through.	2001-05-02

Having avoided Neal Stephenson like the plague for some time (lumping him with William Gibson, whose books I despise), I just read SNOW CRASH, then CRYPTONOMICON in quick succession, and LOVED both.  CRYPTONOMICON is long as heck, but a real page-turner.  Sure, it's fragmented, but the multiple plot lines DO merge, into a wonderfully geek-oriented romp through history, intrigue, and the art and science of cryptography.  This is fun fiction writing at its best -- a great story with humorous, light writing and an engaging style.<br />As a software developer with some experience in crypto, I found it interesting that Bruce Schneier (author of APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY) developed the crypto system used within the book (described as an appendix).  Geeks of my sort will find lots to love here, as will those with a Libertarian bent (strong privacy advocation throughout). Fun, fast, and good, it's one of my favorite light books.	2001-05-02

THE ART OF INNOVATION describes the working atmosphere at IDEO, America's premiere design house. From his words, IDEO sounds like an incredible place to work, full of vigor and fun.  However, the more you read, the more you realize that the author isn't really telling you too much about implementation.  The essential premise &quot;loosen up, have fun,&quot; is just about as useful as &quot;just say no&quot; when trying to successfully modify an office environment. I had hoped for more substance, with less hype and enthusiasm.<br />Still, author Kelley is right on the nose with what he DOES say, and his excitement for his work is palpable.  IDEO is a winning company, and the author praises it in the context of a business-book.  If you can take the concepts Kelley outlines, couple them with good technical skill, and merge it all with good business sense and a healthy dose of luck, you'll have a winner yourself. Just don't buy this book thinking that you'll get a recipe for your own IDEO.<br />Overall, a good, interesting read, if not exactly an academic treatise on the concept of innovation. :)	2001-03-26

From an design standpoint, this is excellent.  The book motivates people to react, and it's not mired in mediocrity.  Notably, if you like NEUROMANCER and other William Gibson/Bruce Stirling novels, you apparently hate SNOW CRASH.  Fortunately, I have never liked Gibson or Stirling, and I loved this book.<br />This book is NOT an attempt to examine society; it is NOT philosophy, nor does it pretend to be (unlike *ahem* other authors). It's a rollicking good read, with lots of action, some good virtual-reality imagery, and a tongue-in-cheek manner that whips the reader through a fun, interesting plotline.  It's supposed to be funny; it IS funny.  It's not a textbook for the future, it's a science fiction novel with few pretensions save an enjoyable story.<br />Want an escape, with interesting characters and a moving plot, read SNOW CRASH. It's fun.	2001-03-22

As the world's greatest STEN fan, I was excited by Chris Bunch's return to the world of science fiction in his new series, starting with THE LAST LEGION. Although I've avoided the Alan Cole fantasy works (blah), I feel justified in saying that either the magic that STEN had was solely from Mr. Bunch's co-author's hands, or from some combination of the two. This book is just not good.<br />I could feel no identification with the main characters of the book; they were too-rapidly introduced and too silly in their natures to be even moderately interesting.  The dialogue is ridiculous, and has the sound of someone TRYING to emulate the conversation onboard a troopship.  Sure, STEN wasn't exactly high art, but at least the characters made you feel what they felt; the Last Legion feels nothing.<br />Sorry, Chris, I had really high hopes for this series. Maybe I'll try again someday, but after two attempts to make it through the first book, I gave up and returned the three books (THE LAST LEGION, FIREMASK, and STORM FORCE) to the store.	2001-03-14

The concept of the book, too, is wonderful -- the computer age in the mid 1800's, a marvelous alternate history.  That all said, the book stinks.<br />I want to like Gibson and Sterling, I really do.  As a software developer and ubergeek, I'm SUPPOSED to love them.  Sadly, I just don't (not even NEUROMANCER), and this book doesn't help. It's weird, it's wordy, and it's annoying.  Like a historical-romance-novel (crappy fiction in a historical setting), this science-fiction-mystery book merely licenses the idea of science fiction, finding an incredibly interesting setting for a so-so mystery plot -- and I hate a mystery story.<br />I must agree with the prior reviewer; I kept reading the book, thinking, &quot;this must get better SOMEWHERE.&quot; It didn't.  The dialogue, with it's 19th century slang, became oddly irritating. I didn't care a whit for the characters, nor the box of cards that they were so interested in.  The continuous stream of historical characters in non-historical roles was neat, but became distracting as the book went along.  There was little else to do, after a couple hundred pages, but throw the book down.<br />I returned the book to the store. I HOPE that I can eventually find at least ONE book by these authors that I can love.	2001-03-14

Although this will not compare to the titles at the epitome of science fiction literature, it IS a good read.  The question of authors aside, the author DOES create quite a page-turner, leading the reader through a maze of characters, whose lives converge in a huge scandal that seems not-so-far-fetched.  It's not Thomas Paine, granted, but it does ask the obvious questions about the political system, and illustrates them with wonderful &quot;What-ifs&quot; in only the way science fiction can.  I'll recommend this for someone looking for good, light-hearted sci-fi reading.  Great for a free weekend or road-trip.	2001-03-12

THE FIRST IMMORTAL is the sort of story that most hard sci-fi fans will enjoy - technology writing and speculation fill the book.  Unfortunately, the author saw fit to add a rather contrived bit of character development and conflict as a key part of the story. Additionally, the author seems rather unsure of how to construct a narrative, as the book begins with first-person storytelling (i.e., &quot;my grandfather was born...&quot;), but then jumps to traditional third-person (i.e., &quot;Ben found himself thinking...&quot;) throughout. While not confusing, this bizarre change of POV can be startling and unpleasant.<br />Bad things aside, the author DOES make a wonderful case for cryonic research, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence. The author is blatantly attempting to sway the minds of his readers to support both pure and applied research into these fields, as he obviously sees them as key technologies to provide hope for humanity. This makes for an interesting, enthusiastic read, and creates a wonderful work of speculative fiction.<br />I read this book in two sittings, and found myself engrossed in the technologies described therein. It was a joy to find such hope placed in science and rational thought.	2001-02-26

Having heard the praise this book has earned for years, I recently purchased the book and read it over the course of a single day of travel - a day of personal epiphany.<br />Gerald Weinberg covers the key aspect of the consulting business: getting and giving advice.  He vividly illustrates the sometimes difficult-to-understand fact that the business is about making money while problem solving, NOT about getting personal credit.  His advice will aid in building confidence in yourself, and in your ability to hear and analyze the environments in which you problem-solve.<br />This book is a simple, quick read - a MUST read for anyone interested in improving their consulting skills.	2001-02-01

However, the book seems to serve less as a historical analysis of warfare than a philosophical treatise, written to refute more popular views on war's causalities. Keegan's consistent return to Clausewitz became irksome, and detracted significantly from the book. The removal of this constant distraction would make the book no less coherent, as the author is well-capable of explaining his own opinions and analysis without contrasting it to the views of others. All-in-all a good book, but one that will annoy you in places and have you rushing through the more philosophical arguments.	2000-10-13

Having somehow  avoided reading this book for 16 years, I picked it up recently at lunch  and finished it in one sitting.  It's that good. Although some parts of the  book seem a bit unnecessary and extraneous (i.e., the Demosthenes and Locke  portions), and the big &quot;surprise&quot; ending isn't that big of a  surprise (at least not to me), the book is extraordinarily well-written and  quick moving.  Anyone who is a big fan of &quot;boot-camp&quot; or other  &quot;hero-overcomes-horrible-childhood&quot; books like Starship Troopers,  Sten, or (a much, much weaker example) F.M. Busby's Bran and Rissa books  will most likely enjoy reading this.<br />In all honesty, I fairly dread the  sequels to this book, although I see little way that I can avoid reading  them.

Sure, it has one of the neatest landscapes of any story. The truth is, however, that  this is a so-so book at best, and I LOVE hard science fiction.<br />In the far  past, I had read one of the sequels to this book, but had somehow never  read the original. Having finally thought to pick it up, I looked forward  to the story, based on the great reputation the book has. Ick. The  characters are very, very, very UN-interesting.  The story starts out to be  a rollicking adventure, but ends in a way that feels as though the author  was ready to be finished and move on to other things.  It's long, detailed,  and interesting for a good portion of the book, then, suddenly, the  characters just hop off the planet.  No resolution, no wrap up, and it  doesn't even leave you wanting any more.<br />The book is filled with  sex...poorly written, rather juvenile sex. Hey, I have enormous respect for  smut, but this is sex as it appears to a fifteen year old boy.  It is NOT  titillating, and it doesn't add squat to the story.  It actually has the  phrase &quot;She impaled herself...&quot; in it. I mean come on! Did the  author have a hard time with imagery?<br />Read it for the book's value, but  don't expect great things. Ringworld is interesting for its strengths, but  its weaknesses will leave you gagging.	2000-09-05
US	51962197	R1KID6CMAG7QLM	0441444253	116925243	Killobyte	Books	5	3	6	N	N	Quick, easy, enjoyable	Having avoided Piers Anthony since junior high school (16 years or so  ago), I was first exposed to him through Killobyte.  As a graphics  programmer, this book is awful and very, very, very wrong.  As a fiction  reader, though, this book is complete, well written, and a delight to sit  and pour through.<br />Killobyte's characters, Walter, Baal, and Phreak, are  perfectly described, their actions, their pasts...they all seem congruous  and well-thought.  The action is quickly paced and often funny.  Fans of  computer gaming will find it especially enjoyable to be immersed in this  fantasy world of gaming, even one that is so very unlikely.  You will read  this book at one sitting, and end up wanting more, guaranteed.	2000-09-05

Having grown up with a  veteran of Korea, I have only experienced the profound silence that my  father exudes, his total unwillingness to relate his activities or  experiences surrounding his military service.  I believe that this book  gave me understanding of my father's pain, if it could not teach me to  empathize.  <br />Although I question the authors conclusion that society is  desensitizing us to enjoy, or at least easily perform, the act of killing,  I find his evidence persuasive.  This book is a simple joy to read, and it  SHOULD be read, by anyone interested in the horror and confusion of war, or  interested in the deepest parts of the nature of man.	2000-09-05

Although the specific plight of the victims of the Japanese  occupation of China is considered the focus of this book, more important,  and more interesting, is the attempt made to understand the reasons for  this occurrence.  After reading this book, read others about similar  episodes: Auschwitz, Dachau, the massacres of Native Americans in the  American West. Try to imagine yourself in the role of power that the  villains played.  Can we all be sure of our own actions?<br />This book  appears a good accounting of the Nanking occupation, and, based on the  references provided, appears factual and complete. It's okay reading,  comparatively simple and uncomplex, and suitable for most any adult reading  level.  It is graphic in some parts, but it does not convey the horror that  other books have captured so well. I agree with earlier reviewers that some  measure of Japan-bashing exists within the book, but the author is clearly  undergoing a cathartic experience of her own throughout the writing, and,  as such, this can be excused.  All in all, a good read.  Highly  thought-provoking and recommended to everyone.	2000-08-17

Prior to reading this, I was unaware of the power of life and death held by  some of the captives over their compatriots within the confies of the death  camps.  The author, who lived through this hell, describes not only the  physical brutality of the place, but the mental anguish experienced by the  prisoners, and the strange roles of those who worked as functionaries,  commanding prisoners, staffing infirmaries, and running the horrible  selections.<br />The book is short, simply-written, and a horrible delight to  read. Few books convey the experience of the Nazi death camps better. I  highly recommend this book for everyone, as it calls to question your OWN  actions and motivations: what price does life hold? How would you REALLY  respond in a similar position?	2000-08-17

Dr. Norman vividly illustrates the good and bad of  design, and provides an excellent guidebook for the understanding of basic  user-centric design in products, fixtures, software, and the everyday  things that make up our world.<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone  interested in the design and creation of software, architecture, or  consumer products.  You will find some dated, quaint information within its  pages, such as the descriptions of the &quot;computer notepad&quot; and  hypertext (both of which came to fruition with Palm Computers and the Web),  but, as a whole, the book is a collection of relevant, interesting  material.  It is an excellent starting point for the study of design.<br />For  those interested in additional study on software and user interface design  (programmers, such as I), I recommend Alan Cooper's books on user interface  design, and ANY of Jakob Nielsen's books. In addition, the Edward Tufte  trilogy on visual representations is extremely good, although not  software-specific.	2000-08-04

Ted Pattison's books are known as an excellent introduction to COM/DCOM/COM+ principles, for any programmer, not just VBers.  Even Don Box, King of COM, loves these  books and recommends them to his C++-based classes.<br />I read this book,  after reading the first edition some time ago, and was not disappointed.  Ted Pattison is an excellent writer, and explains COM with great aplomb. If  you read this and follow it, you will understand COM+.  Now, go read Don  Box's Essential COM and Brent Rector's ATL Internals to make yourself even  smarter.  No real COM programmer can live without these three books.	2000-07-13

The trick questions and puzzles that are in common use by technical interviewers are covered, as well as a  general overview of the interview and job hunting process.  I must  recommend the book for those unfamiliar with the interview process, and  unprepared for the sometimes bizarre questions that interviewers  ask(particularly the infamous Microsoft questions, i.e., Why is a manhole  cover round?).  For those familiar with the interview experience, it may  serve as a guide for interviewing your own job candidates (the reason I  bought it, myself).<br />For a better review of CS topics, I recommend  Brookshear's Computer Science, An Overview, sold here on Amazon.	2000-06-19
US	51962197	R37Z8RN46G7CQG	0345409973	347949682	The Cobra Event	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Scientifically weak, but an excellent suspense novel	Richard Preston has been taken to task for his prior, pseudo-scientific work THE HOT ZONE.  Fortunately, he has turned his efforts toward his true talent, suspense writing.  THE COBRA EVENT is indeed a thriller, and mixes  the author's knowledge of biological agents with a good, old-fashioned  action novel.  Although the writing can seem comical at times, when the  author drags out his layman's knowledge of biological warfare to digress  into ramblings and contextual information, the book generally moves well.   The dialog is awful, but this is something I have come to expect from this  genre, and it detracts little from the book. Pick this up at your library,  or as a cheap paperback for some summer reading (the hardback is also  common on remainders).  You will not be disappointed.	2000-06-14

His premise is a simple one, copy these habits, and your life will be enriched.  Of course, for the everyman, this  involves drills - forcing yourself to follow a step-by-step method as  prescribed by the author.  I agree with Gelb's essential motivation, that  da Vinci is an excellent person to model your life after, but have found  that a study of da Vinci from an historical perspective may well befit  those seeking to follow his life as example.  Start with Bramley and  Reynold's Leonardo, then try the reproductions, The Notebooks of Leonardo  da Vince, Volumes 1 and 2.  You'll enjoy it more, and come away much more  knowledgeable.	2000-05-16

Jesse Liberty offers an excellent beginning for those seeking OOA and D information.  His style is straightforward and noncomplex, with  informative examples and simple illustrations using UML. <br />Follow this  book with his equally-good Clouds to Code, and you have a good base  understanding of OOA and D. Then move on to Riel's Object-Oriented Design  Heuristics, and start using what you've learned.	2000-05-16

It's difficult for me to say much about this book.  The story is short, easy-to-read, and empathic as hell, but really didn't move me to tears, as it did prior reviewers.  Katz well describes the turmoil that exists inside  his young friends, and creates within the reader a strong empathy.   However, even as a geek, I am compelled to agree with a prior reviewer who  described the story as a &quot;story about disenfranchised youth&quot;...  who happen, in this case, to be geeks. I did not get the feeling that the  book really had anything to do with geeks, but could be about any pair of  isolated persons, following their hearts to &quot;ascendancy&quot;. The  book spoke to me, but I suspect it would speak to any person with a past or  present filled with isolation.  It's an easy, quick read, and well worth  your time, but it just didn't get to me.  Thus, it's stuck with an okay - 3  stars.	2000-02-22

His book is organized into sections, each treating one or more of his 68 heuristics, and each one short and  informative.  The level of experience needed to understand the book is  minimal, but those with exposure to the more classical OOA&amp;D authors  are sure to get a few chuckles as Mr. Riel takes on design patterns and  other tools of the trade, clearly making the point that there are no magic  solutions to every problem.  I concur with prior reviewers, who compare  this book to the famous &quot;Effective C++&quot; books of Scott Meyer.  A  must-own.	2000-02-15

This style offers the new user of UML  a good guide to applied modeling concepts, without bogging he/she down in  academic arguments.  If you are going to buy a single book to learn UML, I  highly recommend this one, as it goes beyond simply describing the  notation, and illustrates its use through simple guidelines.  Other books  are necessary to fully understand the complexities of UML, patterns, and  design process, but this one fills a huge gap for the beginner market.	2000-02-08

The book covers C++ COM, not ATL, and provides the reader with an intensive treatment of the  underpinnings and rationale behind the COM specification.  Some of the more  obscure parts of COM are examined, and can be confusing to the novice COM  programmer (Chapters 3 and 5 will drive you nuts), but a proper  understanding of all the materials will definitely give you a leg up.  If  you are looking for lots of programming examples or a cut-and-paste guide  to beginning COM, this is not it, but if you want an insider's view, give  this book a try.	2000-01-12

Hooooo, boy!  This thing is SLOW!  The  author steps through each piece of the user interface, bit by bit by bit,  and writes entire chapters on what seem the most trivial details.  Truth  is, though, his points are valid and thought provoking, but his writing is  more tedious than Tolstoy.  If you want a good overall philosophy of  design, buy his more recent book...it's much shorter and much, much more  fun to read.	1999-10-20

I must  disagree with 'reader from the US', as the book does NOT confuse the reader  with contradictory remarks, but attempts to teach the reader the value of  CONTROLLING anger and expressing it assertively, rather than aggressively.   Although this book is no substitute for a professional counselor, it will  aid the reader in understanding, and, quite possibly, send the reader  searching for further information and help.	1999-07-20

I didn't think that I would need much more than that, since I DID have an eight-inch floppy drive or two to store stuff to...then, suddenly, today happened. Any  and all developers should read this book, and make use of its guidance.  It  may seem a little passe to worry about a program's performance, these days,  but you will write better code and create better products if you implement  only a tenth of this book's concepts.  Buy this and read it. Over and over.	1999-04-09

Most articles are light and  informative, although the reader may be pressed to find application for the  'lessons' learned therein.  Only one glaring bad spot in the book:  a  master's thesis is included that covers the Bank of America MasterNet  failure.  This 'thesis' is so poorly written and difficult to read, I  question the value of the writer's degree.  Otherwise, the book is firmly  in the 'okay' category.	1999-03-11
