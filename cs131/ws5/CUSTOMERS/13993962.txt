Bennett was an associate of Gurdjieff and writes of him with authority.  <br />Bennett held many careers in his life a soldier, linguist, mystic and engineer.He was very much the stereotype of Englishman of his times. He presents himself as both level headed and a skeptic. How much of a skeptic he was I leave the reader to decide but in this volume Bennett tells the story of Gurdjieff's search for the truth and of his teachings. Those with even a passing interest in Gurdjieff will find this book fascinating. <br />The first half some might find a little difficult to slog through as Bennett mentions varous arcane philosophies and places in Central Asia with which most of us in the West are unfamiliar but  <br />it is well worth the time invested. The second half of the book  goes into Gurjieff's teaching methods and his philosophy. <br />As Gurdjieff encouraged skepticism: if you must, read it as a skeptic, but I believe the average reader will find Gurdjieff's travels and his philosophy fascinating. <br />I have known some to find his insights very useful in everyday life. <br />Both a good inroduction and overview to one of the most fascinating figures of the 20th century. <br /> <br />Highly recommended <br /> <br /> <br />Jim Connell  \\"Hallstatt Prince\\"	2005-07-09

I am a big fan of engraving-like illustrations that uses fine line shading (as one can see from some of my other favorites that I have reviewed (Sendak & Crumb). Gorey was a master of this technique,    A great artist and story teller whose tastes were somwhat, absurd, morbid and definitely not PC.    Here is a collection of some of his most famous work including my favorite \\"The Doubtful Guest\\".     Some of  Gorey's work is very much like  some of the parlor games popular in Victorian times. They at times cause us to laugh at things that we usually don't laugh at. In essence they truly fit tthe definition of macabre.     Funny, some times  naughty and sometimes enough to give you the \\"willies\\". His work is always done with a great amount of artistic detail.    Highly recommended.

There was quite a difference in style been the hip culture of the Bay Area as opposed to that of New York City. One thing this book does is spot light the counter culture of New York during the 1960s through the eyes of those who lived it. <br /> <br />These were the days when the movers and shakers freely mixed with  the bohemian crowd. <br /> <br /> The book is although arranged in a type of chronology of the life of Edie Sedgwick. <br /> <br /> It also does an interesting thing in not only focusing on Edie but the two most important men in her life: her father and Andy Warhol. In that way it is an interesting psychological study. <br /> <br />Edie came from a family that was the closest thing to aristocracy in America. But by the  time the Sedgwick family  gets to Edie's generation is has become a very dysfunctional one. <br />And although the book does a good job chronicling the 60s is also is a tale of a life tragically doomed and  the pace it follows through person accounts reads  much like a Greek tragedy while the chorus of friends  and lovers each tell the tale we get the strong feeling, even if we did not know a thing about Edie before we picked up the book, how the story will end. <br /> <br /> Much of the book is about (as well as told by) the denizens of Andy Warhol's \\"Factory\\" and it gives a lot of insight into its culture. I think for most of us it is strange world and  its characters are not always shown in the best light but each of the people interviewed for the book give their perspective usually in a fairly dispassionate way. <br /> <br />It is a book about many things: dysfunctional families, fame, the art world, Warhol, people morally set a drift, the counterculture and a butterfly  squished  on the automobile grill of life. <br />It actually covers quite a bit of ground on a number of levels and whether you findsome of the characters distasteful or not between the lines there is quite a bit said in this book about human nature and American culture. <br /> <br />Included are black and white photos that help us come to know the major players. <br /> <br />It is an interesting book that is hard to put down. <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />Jim Connell   \\"Hallstatt Prince\\"	2005-06-18

However this is not your typical self help book. <br /> <br />Although many of the techniques elucidated in this book have long been known the presentation of how to employ these techniques is quite good. It is a book that I believe anyone can follow and use. <br /> <br />McKenna has been employed by the rich and famous to help them. Let him help you.  <br /> <br />Speaking  from my own scientific background as a psychology major who did his graduate work in neuroscience I see nothing in this book that runs contrary to what science knows about how the mind works. Hypnotism has been with us for a long time and all though popular culture somes times casts a jaunticed eye on it it is something that  works. <br /> <br />This is not a \\"new age fad\\" and the author explains this by giving a brief history of hypnosis in both its use and misuse. <br /> <br />One of the great living Tibetan Buddhist lamas would continue to ask his pupils \\"where is your mind?\\" It is a question that is not as simple to answer as you might think if you reflect on it. I will rephrase by asking \\"are you driving your mind or is your mind driving you? <br /> <br />McKenna's techniques are sound and should help the reader get out of negative  behavioral loops into which we all often fall. <br /> <br />There is nothing sinister about self-hypnosis. It is one of the ways our mind works. Whether or not we are aware of it we are haphazardly  self-hypnotizing everyday. This book shows you how to take control of the process. <br /> <br />Those still in doubt after reading this review should check out other books on hypnosis by McKenna.

My point  back then  was that between nature and nurture by the time  one was in their teen years  one's destiny  was pretty much set in stone. His answer to me was \\"read the Autobiography of Malcolm X\\".<br /><br />Although I still wrestle with the  problems of nature and nurture both in my own private reflections and in my professional occupation this book made a great impact on me.<br /><br />In the book the author takes a  hard look at his life telling the story of his incredibly difficult childhood, the brutal discrimination his family faced, his life of crime and loose living and how his life was turned around in prison when he encountered the teachings of Elijah Muhammad. It also chronicles  his rise in within the Black Muslims, his break with them and his coming  to realize that all men are brothers.<br /><br />The book tells the story of an amazing  evolution of an extraordinary  person; from being persecuted  by whites bigots, to taking on the  vices of  whites to such an extent that he  dated white women, to taking on an ideology  that saw the white man as devils to finally  having the courage to  break away from the very ideology that initially helped saved him from a cycle of crime.<br /><br />This book is for everyone. Malcolm shows us the value of discipline, self-respect and  the value of having the  courage to live according to one's principles. Whether you are a fan of  some of the things Malcolm X did  and said  in the 60s no one can say he  did not walk the walk as well as talk the talk.<br /><br />Malcolm was someone who had everything going against him and yet he demonstrated that anyone can turn their life around.<br /><br />I especially recommend this book to anyone who might be feeling despair. There are a lot of self  help books out there these days, some good some not so good, but I cannot think of a single one more powerful than this book.<br /><br />I regard this book so highly I believe every home  should have a copy.<br /><br />Highly  Recommended<br /><br />Jim Connell  \\"Hallstatt Prince\\"	2005-06-14

It is my perception that many Democrats bemoaning the loss of the past two presidential elections look back on the Clinton presidency wistfully while the former president's detractors, while still keeping a  third eye out for the possibility of another Clinton in the White House, can't stop themselves from keeping up with Bill as if they were rubber necking  a  bad car accident. Love him or hate him (I don't know many that felt luke warm about him) people were and continue to be mesmerized  by him. It is my prediction that generations will continue this peculiar love affair.      Books have come out about him  that are distinctly for and against - obviously mindful of the power he still wields and  the possibility  that the man may someday be  \\"first gentleman\\".      This book however is slightly different in that respect. Although I do not think the book is completely objective  the author strives to be objective and it shows. Given the obvious power of  the personality of  Bill Clinton  as well as the various controversies that swirled about him we are a little too close  in time for anyone  to be completely objective.   Never the less seems to be the closest thing we have yet to a picture of what the  Clinton White House was really like.       I will reiterate that I do believe the author does his best to be objective. I think the best way to describe the author's ultimate view of Clinton is that he strongly ambivalent about the man.  The way the political situation is currently  in this country this book leaves enough open as far as the perception of the character of William Jefferson Clinton  that it will be very  much like a type of ink blot test of the reader. For although Clinton is not always shown in the best light here and some of the revelations in this book will be decried by Clinton supporters I believe both supporters and detractors will feel as they will  have come away from this book with more ammunition.    Harris shows a man more aware of the threat of terrorism  than the public knew as well as someone who was a true believer in the policies he tried to enact.  But the  author also  portrays a president  continually under siege and due to this finds himself unable to act as effectively as he could or would like. Depending on what party  you belong to  some would call his actions prudent and understandable and that he was undermined by his enemies whereas others will see him as a man that did not have the backbone to act on what he saw was the right course of action. In short Harris finds Clinton  not so much of a schemer as someone hampered by his insecurities and whose seeming indesciveness, and what some have characterized as slipperiness, was based on insecurity. And although the author  shows the Clinton White House to be purposely evasive he presents the tactic as perhaps being well warranted. Clinton is shown as well as some who although possessing a flexible mind was not always flexible in his  management style and this quality proved to be a double edged sword. Harris  also gives a  picture of a man that is bright  but undisciplined perhasaps to the point of being self-sabotaging. But the author also shows  Clinton as someone who showed personal growth during his eight years in the White House and who  became more confident is his decision making.    In The Survivor we see the highs and lows of the Clinton presidency and it gives us some insights in to the mechanics of the Clinton White House that frankly  Clinton's autobiography lacked.    A no nonsense clear-headed and aptly titled  biography.      Recommended    Jim Connell  \\"Hallstatt Prince\\"	2005-06-11

Although much of the book takes place in Vietnam, although I am sure it would appeal to many who served in Vietnam, this is not one of those  war \\"niche\\" books. Instead it is a morality tale well told and one is left haunted by it.    Much of the book involves  just a handful of characters who are archetypes and in their interactions sometimes reminds one of the Dialogues of Plato.    The story begins with an old Vietnamese woman who while picking trash dumps for scraps finds  a wounded young America soldier laying in the mud. Between her efforts and a reluctant gruff Sergeant they save his life.    The wounded boy (Corporal Billy Kern) is quite wound up about a recent mystical experience and his brush with death. The Sergeant who helped save him (Sergeant Isaiah Ross) sees Kern as a backwoods kid from Kentucky who is just green behind the ears and whose brush with death has made him delusional.  Kern's believe is pure and innocent and wants to know why God has spared him.     Isaiah Ross comes with his own baggage when it comes to religion and a philosophical discussion ensues between the two of them. Ross is haunted  by the losses his lie and  the days when he was exposed to a blind fire and brimstone preacher. But Ross we learn is  a man who does believe in something - he believes in duty and structure.     But Ross will meet up with Kern again when Kern,  after an incident in which Kern protects the elderly  Vietnamese woman who saved him from an MP, ends up being  put up for court martial for the scuffle.     Ross, in his testimony, agrees with Kern that he is able to  go back in the bush. They are words Ross will come to regret.    Kern ends up  being demoted to private and is sent back out into combat.    Into the story comes a reporter for Stars and Stripes,  a Lieutenant Patric Gallo, who covers the court martial. He is disgusted with the injustice of the verdict.    When Gallo and Ross meet after the trial  it is a strange pairing. They could not be more different.    Not long after the court martial Kern disappears and Gallo becomes obsessed with his story. The fate of Kern continues to gnaw at Gallo even after he returns from the states. Could Kern still be alive?    Gallo and Ross stay in touch over many years and many life changes. The one thing they have in common are the memories of Billy Kern.  Kern is something of a Christ symbol but at the same time he represents something more basic. He represents  a question that haunts and  truth that must  be pursued.    Gallo finds bits and pieces from time to time through friends in the press  that lead him to believe Kern is still alive and  still in Nam. Every time he presents these fragments to Ross he always finds a reason to dismiss them.  Perhaps the reader might initially find Ross a distasteful unbelieving and pompous character. But you will learn that the solidness of Ross is yet another  spiritual path and his manner will come to be a great aid in finding the truth.    To go any further in this synopsis would be to play the role of the spoiler. However I will say that this is really just the beginning of what is about to ensue and  by the end of the story you will find out what happened to Billy Kern.    The characters of Kern, Ross, and Gallo as well as an old newspaperman in Wyoming  and  a Vietnamese guide each represent a  unique spiritual path. The journey they take collectively (spiritually and otherwise)  could not be accomplished without the help of the others. And by the end each of them has grown.  It is a story about many things not the least of which are redemption, belief and the interconnectedness of humanity.    It is a book full of surprises not the least of which is the wisdom demonstrated by the author.      Highly recommended.    Jim Connell   \\"Hallstatt Prince\\"	2005-06-09

As I had said in a previous review in a book on fibulas  they were  pins  (perhaps the original safety pin) used  for both holding clothes together and for decoration.    From some burials we can gather that  some decorated themselves very elaborately with fibulas.    Fibulas changed in appearance so much  one  wonders just how fashion conscious people of the Bronze Age and Celtic times were so the  study of fibulas might make for an interesting study in any of those who are interested in  the history of trends in fashion.     The title is  bit deceiving as the fibulas covered are found in a range from the Balkans to upper Eastern Europe. It shows not only the  influence of the movement of the Celts but of trade as many Celtic fibula types were coveted by other cultures of the ancient world.    In typical Praehistoriche Bronzefunde fashion the book is filled with illustrations including a fold out  in the back showing   a time line  through the years from Bronze Age  to middle La Tene times and the fibulas that were created during  those times. Included as well are illustrations  of bronze finds, such as axe heads, found  in places where the fibula were found buried.    Very helpful are the numerous maps showing the location of various fibula types.    This book should be of great interest to anyone interested in archeology.

They should be  of great interest to the art historian.  <br /> <br />All of them are portrayed in line drawings which are incredibly beautiful and are presented in a chronological fashion and through charts that show the evolution of their aesthetic and technology. <br /> <br />Although the book is in German even those who  will not even attempt to translate the book I believe  will find this book fascinating. <br /> <br />Once again the Praehistorische Bronzefunde series does it again  providing up to date information on the artifacts of the cultures  of Europe. There are many who have read  books on the Celts and the Bronze Age but much of that information is second hand. For those of you who fall into that category I invite you to try the Praehistorische Bronzefunde series as the next step in your education. <br /> <br />For the student of archeology, the Bronze Age and the Celts. This particular volume also makes for a great coffee table book. <br /> <br /> <br />Highly recommended <br /> <br />Jim Connell   \\"Hallstatt Prince\\" <br /> <br />	2005-06-07

It is even rumored that Stanley Kubrick  based his Dr. Strangelove character after him.    But the truth is he does a job someone has to do when countries possess nuclear weapons.    In this book  Kahn discusses the unthinkable: how would a nuclear war be fought and what would be the consequences. He does this  in the only way it can be done-in a dispassionate way. He asks such questions as to whether civilization can survive a nuclear war and if so how long it would take for it to recover.    His conclusion based on the facts and technology of the time he wrote the book (1962) was that nuclear war was winnable. Detractors of the book saw it as advocating nuclear war which is far from the truth. How easy it is to shoot the messenger.    From many accounts of Kahn the man he was far from bloodless and  he was in fact optimistic about the future.     As one reads this book one   enters into the mind of a great thinker. He was a highly logical man who dared to take on a problem others saw as taboo. Some may not like the way he deals with the subject but as long as we possess nuclear weapons the problems and all of their ramifications must be considered.    A frightening yet interesting read.

Someone has saved me the trouble as I was hell bent on having it republished if I had to do it myself.    The original books were printed in the early \\"teens\\" of the twentieth century (the first book printed in 1913 if memory serves).    For those of you who loved the reprinting of the old Sears catalogue, or admire ingenuity or are mechanically inclined  you will love this book. I guess truth be told it is my opinion that everyone will love this book.    Page after page is filled with projects ,some of them being quite advanced, on how to create devices-from building a better mouse trap, to building a working  airplane that will fit a human flier to casting a suit of armor. Most of the instructions are complete with line drawings (some of them quite artfully done) that reflect the times in which the book was first published.    The books came in three volumes and are a product of their times when inventors were revered and Thomas Edison was still very active. Apart from it being very practical (there are some solutions to modern day problems still found within these pages) it is a testament to the inventiveness of the human mind. In a way in these days when everything is made out of plastic and the working  parts under an automobile hood are  hidden under a factory seal it can be taken today as a type of manifesto.    My father had these books and I remember to this day the occasions when he would take them out and unwrap them and how I would carefully leaf through them page by crumbling page like some great holy manuscript.     Reading this book led me to a fascination with such things as cable cars and other devices I would assemble as a child that would stretch across our family living room. It also help me to establish a love of science.    To this day when I am looking for a solution in a laboratory where I am working I will sometimes look though The Boy Mechanic for some inspiration.    Fascinating for the adult and an absolute gift to older children and young adults.    Highly recommended    Jim Connell   \\"Hallstatt Prince\\"	2005-06-06

Although most of the volumes are in German the illustrations and maps really tell the story well enough for even those without a knowledge of German for those with a modicum of knowledge about the period they cover. <br /> <br />In this volume  the author takes on an important subject - the horse bit: where they are found and the different forms they took. It is obvious  from the archeological record that much experimentation was done in perfecting the horse bit. It also shows how specialized they were already becoming.  <br /> <br />The greatest of the horse breeders  of the ancient world were the Scythians, and it is hypothesized  that the Cimmerians acting as middlemen brought the not only Scythian horses but Scythian technology t the Celtic heartland. The study of bits found in eastern Europe is therefore very important. <br /> <br />The horse had many uses but one of them was  in warfare. Horse bits most probably  were different  for different types of warfare: when the horse was used  in fighting from a chariot as opposed to a rider fighting from horse back. <br /> <br />These artifacts give us a glimpse into the technology of the day, of warfare and the movement of peoples. <br /> <br />Once again in this volume it is shown  how advanced technology was in central Europe during this shadowy period of time. <br /> <br />This book along with being of interest to students of archeology, the bronze age and the Celts will probably be of interest to the horse enthusiast as well. <br /> <br />I cannot recommend these books strongly enough. <br /> <br />Jim Connell  \\"Hallstatt Prince\\"	2005-06-06

The book is put out by the Praehistorische Bronzefunde (Prehistoric Bronze finds) series.    Don't let the German scare you. If you are interested in the archeology of central Europe you will love these books. Even if you don't read German  at all you will be fascinated by the masterful art of the people of the Urnfield culture (defined as pre or proto Celtic depending on   the author) who made the vollgriff sword (Even though Vollgriif translates as \\"full grip\\" even in English it is proper to refer to these swords as vollgriff swords).     An ambitious non-German reader should be able to make it through parts of text with a German dictionary or a translation engine.     The people of the Urnfield  period were great artisans who knew a great deal about metallurgy.   Creating a vollgriff sword  required a great deal of skill as the main body in the blade, hilt and tang had to be cast first and the handle had to be cast on top of the tang.     The handles were often times intricately decorated many times with  continuous  spiral borders. The  vollgriff style of  bronze swords were created  between 1600 and 1100 BC (before that period the handles were made of organic material) and are quite a testament to the advanced culture that existed in Europe during this  period of time.    Included in this book, like others books of the Prehistorische Bronzefunde series, are not only many intricate line illustrations of the finds but  usually a few illustrations of the complete graves in which many of the objects that were found as well as  maps of Europe  showing the precise location where the objects were found.     Many of the Praehistorische Bronzefunde books, like this one, are invaluable for the Celtophile.       A tip of my hat to Amazon for carrying these books.

I personally believe it is bad science to try prove or disprove religious truths and religion is still smarting from trying to use religion to dispute scientific truths. That being said this book in a way makes for an exception to that adage.    The book is about the saints and the beatified whose bodies have not decayed and whether you are a religious person or not I think you will find it a quite interesting phenomena.    The book starts by discussing the natural decay of buried flesh, mummification and certain natural conditions (such as in peat bogs) in which the bodies of the dead will be preserved.    After this discussion Cruz presents a case by case study of the bodies of the saints  and the beatified  who escaped corruption despite the conditions in which they were buried. With each case there is a brief biography of the individual.     The number of cases in which the bodies of saints escaped decay is actually very remarkable.  Included in the book are some astounding photographs.    A very thought provoking read.    Jim Connell   \\"Hallstatt Prince\\"	2005-06-06

Interview with the Vampire was the first of the  Anne Rice series of vampire books and is my favorite. The book is fresh and pure. it is a mini-epic that is reads from the little I know of the author's life as semi-autobiography.    Here we have th story a Louis  stricken with grief  who is made a vampire by the vampire Lestat.     The story begins in New Orleans but takes us from there to the Balkans and then to France where Louis meets others of his kind.    Lestat and Lois read like two demons or philosophical points of view with which the author wrestles and explores. Louis is  a well intentioned deeply religious figure where as Lestat is a bit of a hedonist, fop and trouble maker.    Before Lestat was elevated as a type of vampire super hero in the author's other books Interview with the Vampire had them as a pair of buddies (or blood brothers as it were). Quicky  skillfully and with ease Rice developes these two characters and makes their interaction fascinating.     In essence it is quite a human story of two non-humans.  Rice re-invented the Vampire genre in this series but I think  this book (as opposed to the others that followed) will appeal to the general reader of fiction and not just the fan of horror  novels.	2005-06-02

Perhaps the strongest thing about it was the art of Gil Kane.     Kane's renderings are  true works of art, some times surreal some times psychedelic, that are time capsule of our fears at the height of the cold war. In a word Kane's work  in \\"The Atom\\" gives a strong feeling of the apocalyptic.     It was a science based comic book which I found very appealing when I discovered it as a child. For a comic book some of themes, characters and dialogue are actually fairly sophisticated.     This volume reproduces pages  of the first and probably best issues  of  the comic.	2005-06-02

It had almost become a footnote for history for many until the likes of journalists like Christopher Hitchens brought its events back into the spotlight.    Now Richard Zack's  \\"The Pirate Coast\\" brings the events of the war of Barbary Pirates into sharper focus.    During the Presidency of Thomas Jefferson  our fledgling nation faced a thorny problem. The United States and  other European nations were forced to pay tribute to the nations of the North African coast to do business in the Mediterranean or would be subject to attack by the Barbary pirates. The other nations of Europe went along with this practice but the US was against it  not only on principle but because of its sheer cost (at one point we paid the Barbary pirates  tribute which exceeded the entire US military budget).    At the time the practice of the Barbary pirates was to commandeer   foreign ships and sell their crew into slavery.      Eaton was sent by Jefferson in  1805 on a clandestine mission  to aid in a revolution going on in Tripoli. Now comes the intesteting character of Eaton. Eaton was by accounts a stubborn individual who   seemed to get himself in trouble in every endevour he found himself in  but Eaton was   a super patriot who saw this mission  as a chance to redeem himself. However the revolution in Tripoli sputtered. Jefferson was more than willing to aid  a people in a revolution but wanted no part in overthrowing a government now that  the revolution had been foiled.    Eaton was promised a large amount of funding but at the last moment after Jefferson hearing the revolution in the area has failed  Eaton is   sent off virtually alone. However Eaton   once given the green light for the mission could not be stopped.     He was virtually alone an army unto himself. Little did anyone expect that is just what he was.  Sent out on impossible mission with insufficient provisions and  just a few men anyone else would have given up but to borrow  a name from popular culture Eaton was the \\"Jack Baurer\\" of his day and became an exemplar for the covert ops agent.    Once in Alexandria he employed mercenaries and Bedouins for an improbably march across the deserts of Libya. Eaton has to deal with the luke warm alliance and  friendship of the Bedouins who often press   Eaton into bargaining and renegotiations of their terms.      Amazingly  Eaton and his  group of misfits arrive in Tripoli and defeat the forces there playing a crucial role in the defeat of the Barbary Pirates. How crucial of this  assault from land was to the outcome war is a matter of opinion but it does not take away from Captain Eaton's achievement.      However once back in America  Eaton could not let go of the fact that Jefferson  had let him down and did not kept the promises he made and was not shy in telling him so. For this reason perhaps  Jefferson  never gave Eaton the credit he was due. In the end  Eaton dies an early death - drunken, in debt and  unacknowledged.    A great yarn and thought provoking read that has implications for the war  in which we are now presently engaged.  Highly Recommended.	2005-05-31

Although some may take a little time getting used to the Saxon names and genealogy  anyone who enjoys biographies or history should love this book.       Although filled with detail Smyth breaths life into the days of Alfred. A religious man  who was both a brilliant scholar a brilliant tactician and one tough  soldier. Such was his   brilliance he did such remarkable things as help to adapt the Viking boat to suit his own army's needs for a craft more suited to navigating  the coast of Britain.       He almost single-handedly created what we know today as England and through his treaty with the Vikings he established an economic zone of a type shared by both the Saxons and the Vikings and in so doing played an important role in the creation of the English language.      After his peace with the Vikings he established a just system of laws and    an aggressive plan to educate the   populace of England.     The biography starts with the peculiar and unfortunate circumstances within his family that led to his succession. He found himself, trained as monk, in the midst of one of the great watershed moments of British history when England was being overrun by the Vikings.  His campaigns as a defeated underdog  reclaiming his kingdom makes for truly exciting reading. The book is filled with detail including shedding light on how  the main biography  historians in the past (Asser's \\"Life\\") had been drawing from was a forgery.    The story of the forgery of Asser's \\"Life\\" , what was the standard biography of Alfred the great up until recent times, is in itself a story within a story in this book.      Through the examination of works of Alfred himself we come to understand his great wisdom.    A fascinating read about a monumental figure of history.    Highly recommended.	2005-05-30

I wonder how many   young people that pick up these TFH books are   permanently turned off by science. As it is a publisher meant for the hobbyist and the main outlet for their books are pet stores one would think this volume would contain more about the practical problems of   sea anemone maintenance and care but it does not. At best it is a   half hearted   attempt at scholarship about the creatures themselves   but it is poorly organized   and does not go into any detail. True there are pictures of anemones in the volume but not enough to call it a picture book and certainly   not a reference guide. Some of the identifications   that the book does make are somewhat questionable. Apparently the publisher saw their was a niche to be filled in the TFH   library and had someone slap this one together. I am not acquainted with   other work by the author and part of the problem with this book might be   poor translating and editing. <br />If you want to know   what a sea anemone is I guess you can flip through this book but   you won't be getting much more than what the Britannica will tell you	2005-05-30

For the uninitiated many Turkoman rugs are known as (or rather given the misnomer of ) Bohkaras.  This book  by Loges (a close approximation to the pronunciation of his surname is \\"locust\\") has long been recognized by rug collectors as one of the most important books on Turkoman rugs.     Naturally its chapter's are divided by the various tribes such as the Tekke ,Yomud etc. The tribes typically (except for the Ersari) are each represented by at least one gul type unique to that tribe (the word gul is Persian for flower) usually that is repeating (with an almost machine like  precision in many of these rugs). The guls are thus an identifying symbol and a totemic device. However since images are easily transferable there can sometimes be found a gul usually identified with one tribe appearing on rugs of another tribe. This is where the importance of the technical analysis of weaving types and materials used and color palette comes in.      The book is full of good quality color photos. It is extremely helpful with attributions. It goes into great detail on the technical analysis of Turkoman weaving and yet is approachable to the general reader. A  very useful table on technical analysis is found  in the back of the book. Both dealers and collectors will find this book extremely useful as a reference.    Highly recommended.

An excellent commentary written by one of  the real gentlemen of the rug business. The author  offers some of his own unique theories and insights. Jim does tend to put emphasis on his own particular favorite types of rugs  such as  Persian tribal rug weaving so know that it is not a comprehensive guide. This in no way lessens the importance of this book. Good as a coffee table book for anyone who appreciates beauty as well as must have for the rug aficionado.	2005-05-26

Henri Fabre (Concord Library Series)	Books	5	13	13	N	N	For the naturalist in all of us	In this book Fabre is not only a taxonomist but a behaviorist and he describes insect behavior in a charming and almost poetic way. This book is   in no way dry in the way some find books on science to be and as much as it teaches us about insects and other classes of invertebrates it also   teaches us about observation. And though I am vehemently opposed to mixing science with mysticism this book would probably be enjoyed by those seeking self improvement and spirituality as much as it would be enjoyed by the scientist. <br />When I was a child I had an aunt (God bless you Aunt Alberta) who lived on the West coast. She was a Biology teacher. Every once and awhile care packages of books would come from California. One of those books was \\"The Insect World of J. Henri Fabre\\". My mother would sometimes read to me from the book when our family when for a drive. I used to hang on every word.  <br />In a way that book changed my life as I am now a scientist.  <br />I think it can change yours as well. In this loud brash world let Fabre guide you into the gentle world of observation. <br />Highly recommended.	2005-05-26

Although some may quibble with a few of the attributions the book is a masterpiece. If one book could be credited as elevating the Caucasian rug from an unuappreicated (and at that time underpriced) art form to the status that it enjoys today it is this one. It is generously filled with color photographs. The art of photographing rugs has come along way since this book was put in print and some might be disappointed that the photos are not more crisp but I cannot  emphasize enough that this is an important work and an incredibly beautiful book.    The main focus of the book is 19th century Caucasian village rugs although it contains some discussion of earlier rugs of the Caucasus.     Highly recommended.

It is in no way a definitive work as the rugs took on many different forms (see for example the Bernheimer Tiger rug offered for sale at the famous Christies auction in 1996) and there are some repetition of subtypes. Nevertheless it is quite an amazing book and makes a good contribution to the literature on oriental rugs. <br />Many cultures of the East valued the pelt of the tiger. But leave it to the Tibetans to come up with a compassionate and ecologically wise solution to the demand of these prized skins. <br />This also makes for a great coffee table book. <br />Recommended.	2005-05-26

Is this book a blast from the right? No in my opinion it is a blast straight from the heart of the author and he is as mad as hell.    Is Zell sincere? Is he a true embodiment of integrity? It is my belief that he is but I will let the reader decide.    For those who do not like Zell Miller I encourage you to read this book anyway. Forget all of the Zell bashing you have heard an approach this book with an open mind. If you cannot bring yourself to buying his book I suggest that you take it out of the library. I think a fair minded left winger will find something in this book that speaks to them. If nothing else if you are a hardcore left wing Democrat you might learn something about why Kerry lost the last election.    More than this book being a diatribe against the Democratic party I believe this book is a cautionary tale for all of us as Americans.     Zell Miller  points out case by case how American values have strayed. Now I am not a fan of the religious right, at least those of them that are intolerant zealots, but I do believe like Zell we need to return to our values whether they be based in Christianity, Judaism, Islam Buddhism or whatever what faith  to which we ascribe.     For even if one is an atheist there are certain core principles we all share or should share. I am not suggesting everyone should return to the Bible but it is certainly time for us to get our act together. This country definitely needs some backbone and boy do we need it now.    The author emphasizes the importance of duty  and sacrifice. It is a message many of us in these days of instant gratification do not want to hear but  it is something we must hear if we are to survive as a culture and as a nation.    We live in some of the most perilous times this world has ever seen yet we find ourselves lulled into opinions of the mass media that many times have no basis in fact of logic. Our culture, as Zell Miller  points out, is both crude and banal. How can anyone who lives in America argue with that?    (Those  ideologues who wish to throw mud at the author and to point to his past with his less than an exemplary record on civil right I will remind you of one name - Robert Byrd.)    Zell despite his former short comings is a sincere individual and a former marine you served his country admirably. He has the courage of conviction to blow the whistle on a party that had turned its bak on its former principles and turned its back on America.    He is a true patriot and a man willing to forsake his party rather than to forsake America.    I am neither a Democrat nor a Republican and I a leery of propaganda coming from either side. We now and always have needed a loyal opposition.  I for one am sick as hell of both parties but our President right now happens to be a Republican. Shame on the many Americans who want our President to fail. For wishing the President of our country to fail no matter what political party he belongs to is a depraved desire to see ourselves fail and to have our children be put in peril. That is a true deficit of decency. I am afraid that  we as Americans have forgotten the day of 9-11-01.    I am not one of those wishing to deify Zell Miller. As books have become another form of mass media I do not know enough about him from one book to make the claim that he is\\" a truly great man\\". But in this book he stands out as a champion against a current that is destroying this country.	2005-05-25
US	13993962	R2TKSC5NE0USU3	0743226712	53542661	1776	Books	5	29	33	N	N	An improbable victory	For McCullough standards this is a surprisingly short book but nonetheless an important one and very inspiring. Rather than it focusing on battles it exposes us to some of the cross currents of the day and the true heroes of the American Revolution: the common citizen.  This book does include some actual armed combat but its main focus is in no way   the battles of the war. It does some give insight on the politics of the day. As   American and British diplomats tried  to reach a compromise, things in the Americas continued to decline until war   was practically unavoidable. King George is shown in a less harsh light than how he is usually   portrayed in modern times and McCullough brings up such neglected facts as that   a third of the members of the British Parliament were against the war.     Spotlighted are  Green,  Knox, and of course George Washington,  as well as the British commander, General William Howe.   Washington here makes for an interesting study. Washington himself is shown as courageous, a true leader, initially an inept tactician   and very much of an aristocrat. The New England Yankees   the Virginian Washington   comes to commmand are portrayed as a group of undisciplined rabble and Washington is found having to deal with a clash of cultures. However   if initially a failure at strategy and tactics Washington is shown as a quick learner and made use of such techniques as night time assaults. However the main focus of this book is the American infantry man. The Americans were plagued by poor sanitation Small Pox and various other miseries and depravations.   Countering this  though is the tenaciousness of the  citizen solider and the inventiveness of the average American.  Quite revealing and a testament to the American character.  Highly recommended.	2005-05-25

The job he does  is a job that when troops are deployed must be done. It is a job that we collectively as a country sanction. It is an interesting study of one man's mind as he is doing this job. Whether you are hawk or dove  it is a book that should be read as it more about human psychology than it is about war. <br />Of course  by saying this I do not mean to say that the book is devoid of history as it is chock full of it. <br />It is also not just about killing but about skill and what it means to be skilled at something. <br />If you give this book a chance it will get you thinking. <br />A very challenging  and multileveled book that is not so easy to dismiss (as much as many would perhaps like). It is very much worthy of your attention.	2005-05-25

However I do take issue  with some of the information presented in this book. There is much debate as to the periods of Celtic invasion and more and more the research in both linguistics and archeology continue to push the dates of Celtic occupation further and further back. The Celts and peoples that existed before pre-Celtic times traded with Ireland  along the mid Atlantic trade routes for millennia and the Celtic invasions themselves are believed to have occurred along both the mid-Atlantic route and across the English channel.  <br />Please keep this in mind as you read this book. <br />That being said the this book is still a great resource especially if used in conjunction with current credible sources on the topic of the Celtic invasions.	2005-05-24

That being said he is not someone I would recommend to the academically minded Celtophile except with this caveat - some of Ellis's ideas  Celtophiles might find intriguing.  I find his ideas about  Celtic achievements and their contribution to modern Europe to be right on target. That subject is worthy of an entire book unto itself. Too long have the Celts taken a backseat to the classical Mediterranean world.  There is an unfortunate de-emphasis information on the archeological record of this Celts. Perhaps this is good quality for in introductory text for the general reader  but some Celtophiles may find this disappointing.  I recommended as a first book in the hope that you buy at least one additional book (like Barry Cunliffe's The Ancient Celts) as your introduction. For the Celtophile who already has a few shelves of books on the Celts on their shelves  I do believe this book does have something to offer you as well.	2005-05-23

The photos of the book are breathtaking and the book gives a good overview of Celtic art spanning the Celtic period. However  the reader should bear in mind that the book is not comprehensive. Books available in German such as the Praehistorische Bronzefunde series  give one a glimpse as to how wildly creative the Celts were especially in all of the art in general of  Hallstatt period and of the variety of of styles found on fibula  in the La Tene period. I highly recommend one with a serious interest in Celtic art to continue to search for more source material in addition to this book.

Although I could make alternative arguements that Celtic culture has morphed into  what is now modern Europe, the author is concerned with such things as the dying Celtic languages and customs. The case he makes is quite a strong and convincing one. Pan-Celticists hang on to you hats but don't huff and puff just yet. The author is concerned with the destruction of what we have come to know as Celtic culture but to my mind this in no way runs contrary to the evidence that much of Europe actually sprung from Celtic culture and a fair-minded person should not see this book as an attack on those theories. <br />This is more of a call to arms and a much needed one.	2005-05-23

The conference and this volume that followed was quite fruitful in drawing many specialties together to give us a clearer picture of Bronze Age Britain.  <br />The essays contained in this volume touch on a wide variety of subjects: Scottish settlements, rituals in the days of the Bronze Age, growth of agriculture in the Bronze Age, theoretical reconstruction of wooden structures, mining and other topics. It is also nicely illustrated. <br />Necessary reading for anyone interested in the British Isles in the Bronze Age period. <br />	2005-05-21

I see Posner's book as balanced and carefully researched. In my opinion as a journalist he does not seem betray any liberal or conservative bias.  Saudi Arabia was somewhat of a backwater as well as a country whose survival was in question until oil was discovered there by Americans in the 1930s.  Posner gives us  background of life in Saudi Arabia before the days of oil. The picture is not a pretty one. It was a society both intolerant and brutal.  But when oil was discovered the US, originally through Aramco, a dance began with this peculiar culture.  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia long has a history of being anti Jewish and later anti-Israel.  The US  has been trying to perform a balancing act for decades between  its support for Israel and while trying to maintain a good relationship with Saudi Arabia. In the meantime the Saudis  have been waging an ideological war in both funding  the Wahabis in their own country and funding projects in our own universities.  Posner points out how we have and continue  to defer to the Saudis time and again.  This brings us to 9-11-01 and these post 9-11 days.  Posner exposes members of the House of Saud that had, and may still have, direct connections to al-Qaeda. He also account chilling plans the ruling family  has to detonate their own oil fields with radiological devices in the event they are overthrown.  The authors does a wonderful job showing how the interests of Saudi Arabia and the US have become complicatedly entangled despite the fact that the two countries  have vastly different goals.  Highly recommended.	2005-05-21

Barber   concentrates in this book not on the variety of and classification of bronze age artifacts but the effect on bronze making had on society and on the status of the craftsmen themselves. Mining, smelting casting and deposition are his main focus here as well as the effect the magic of transformation of metals had on society. There are some interesting meditations here. I personally wish more time was spent on the various types of bronze artifacts made in during this period. I also felt too much time was spent on deposition as it is a subject that has been covered quite extensively in other volumes.  Still it is a well written book and I believe worthy of your attention.	2005-05-19

The author offers plausible theories on the Greek dark ages the collapse of other civilizations of the Eastern Mediterranean and the problem of \\"the Sea People\\".

Scholarly   but not overly pedantic and certainly not impenetrable. <br />The author relies much archeology and offers no easy solutions to theoretical problems. <br />The conclusions offered are in various shades of gray depending on the reliability and amount of evidence. However the reader should be aware that certain theories are being pushed here with which many might disagree. <br />Rome certainly did not come from a monolithic source and the author provides a survey of the many cultures that inhabited that peninsula as well as the outside civilizations that colonized it. However the book is not without   certain controversies. <br />One of the author's great strengths in this book is his knowledge   of   current    archaeological discoveries Etruria and in Latium   as well as    period of orientalization and early Iron Age. Thus, the book's greatest strength is its careful  synthesis of historical and archaeological data for the period preceding the republic; and it is likewise excellent concerning Roman external affairs and conquest of Italy. Perhaps the books biggest weakness is its insufficiently critical treatment of the ancient literary sources .  <br />The book's   15 chapters are methodically presented and are augmented with very helpful illustrations and tables. A brief overview of human culture in Italy from the Bronze Age to the early Iron Age. The author's treatment of the importance of ascribing cultural difference between inhumation and cremation I personally found somewhat controversial.  <br />In this reviewers opinion he rightly dismisses some of the value of   the written tradition of the formation of Rome.  <br />Further controversy is raised in chapter four with the authors contention that the clan did not proceed the city-state and heroic graves   but were enmeshed together. It does give one something to think about. <br />   Yet another controversy offered in this book which personally I take issue with is the minimization of the influence of the Etruscans on Roman culture. <br />   Actually there is quite a bit to chew on here   yet I do not what to dissuade the reader form picking it up. Just be aware that there is a lot of theory in this book some of   which many academics might take issue. <br /> One thing the book successfully establishes is that by the beginning of the early third century B.C. Rome had acquired the political structure which laid the foundations for its later greatness. <br /> <br />One would hope the reader after being inspired by this volume would look into authors that offer equally compelling alternative theories. <br />Highly recommended. <br /> <br />  <br />	2005-05-18

His contention is people's involvement with monuments was central to the creation of new senses of time and place, and that this helped in the transition to new types of settlements and agriculture.

A few  years ago visiting family in Chicago I was sad to hear that Dr. Richardson had passed on. He was an inspiration. I still carry my \\"Pit 11 pass\\" in my wallet with pride.  Mason creek is an amazing site. It is rich in fossil invertebrates (including soft bodied animals) and probably contains more different species  of insects than anywhere else in the world (at least at the time when I studied there it was known as having more different species of insects than anywhere else in the world) was  It is also the place where the famous \\"Tully Monster\\" was found.

Pub 1967 Issued As V. 18 of London Oriental Series (English and Tibetan Edition)	Books	5	9	9	N	N	The Nine Ways of Bon	A fascinating glimpse into the original pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet. It is a religion similar to Siberian Shamanism . Bon was said to have been brought to Tibet in ancient times from a land to its west. The text \\"The Nine Ways of Bon\\" however dates   as being approximately 400 years old long after Buddhist missionaries first appeared in Tibet so we are uncertain how much of the original Bon ways were influenced by Buddhism when this text was originally written. Certainly  Tibetan Buddhism was itself influenced by Bon. Bon did go through periods of persecution in Tibet by the Buddhists hundreds of years ago but  now but Bonpos  and Buddhist lamas often work together. There are still Bonpos praciticing in Tibet and through out the world today.  <br />The Nine ways are as follows. <br />1.) THE WAY OF THE SHEN OF THE PREDICTION  <br />2.) THE WAY OF THE SHEN OF VISUAL WORLD  <br />3.) THE WAY OF THE SHEN OF ILLUSION  <br />4.) THE WAY OF THE SHEN OF EXISTENCE  <br />5.) THE WAY OF THE VIRTUOUS ADHERERS  <br />6.)

At last a book I can put on  my bookshelf next to Holland's  Moth Book.    Excellent book that not only deals in the taxonomy of Saturniidae moths but of collecting and rearing as well. Great illustrations and maps.     Previously much of this information was only available in bits and pieces on the Internet and in obscure publications and has never been previously compiled in one volume.     For those of you not familiar with Saturniidae they are the family of giant silk moths. Some species are the size of a small bird. Just about every location in America is home  to at least one species of giant silk moth and they even live in our big cities.Why do most people not see them? Well one reason is they are nocturnal and high flying. If you look in wooded areas however you will often see their cocoons. One can purchase live silk moth cocoons and the females readily attract males  by a phermone that can be detected by the male of the species for miles.        As a moth breeder I welcome this book.	2005-05-15

It is comprehensive but I would not say not complete as no book on this subject could be. Still I believe this book to be the best work compiled in book form. Described by many as \\"the Bible\\" on the subject it indeed may be but it is not dogmatic as it offers several options and methods and leaves it for the aquarist to use. <br />(Note: This volume covers stony corals and not soft corals). <br />When I started keeping marine aquaria keeping back in 1970 one almost had to employ the skills of a chemist. In those days most people in the hobby thought it nearly impossible to care for many of the species of coral now commonly kept. It was only through the encouragement of a local public aquarium (the John G. Shedd Aquarium) whereas a high school student I was able to participate in collecting trips that I got the encouragement to experiment. I started out with Robert Straughan's books back in 1970 which both helped to get me in trouble and helped me grow as an aquarist.   both In those days there was an awful lot of trial and error. Later in the late 70's I helped to pioneer some techniques when I worked for the Steinhart Aquarium in San Francisco. In those days in San Francisco I worked for one of the largest marine fish wholesalers in the world. We had a lot of shipments that went off to Germany and now I wonder if some of the species that passed through my hands ended up in the hands of the authors. Somewhat of a revolution went of in the hoby in the 1980 thanks in part to the efforts of  the Germans. Thankfully the hobby is now much more of a disciplineand a lot more humane. It is quite amazing how far the hobby has come. I am sure the hobby   will continue to evolve. This   is a pricey book but it is a pricey hobby and this book is one of the best, if not the best, books on the subject available.

Witty and well written (five stars) but obnoxious to the point of being juvenile (one star).     I really think  would getting along wonderfully with the author if we met face to face but I find her approach really misguided.    Coulter makes some good points and her commentary would make for a great standup act but she is helping polarize the country and that is not what Martha Stewart would call \\"a good thing\\".    In the seven questions asked my Amazon  to authors Ann Coulter says favorite book is the Bible but her approach is anything but Christian. Don't get me wrong I am not calling her a hypocrite but personally I don't think the Deity  would approve of her mean spiritedness.     Close to half of the country in the last presidential election voted Democratic. You can't just dismiss this.    It is a shame because Coulter is bright and I agree with much of what she has to say on other topics but I don't agree with her opinions on how to deal with liberals.    What is her advice in talking to liberals? Don't back down. Well, I believe people should stand by their convictions but there is a difference between being principled and being an attack dog.    Ann Coulter is a phenom. One reason for this is unfortunately her habit of biting into people. I am afraid a lot of her message is being lost by her approach. There are times when I applaud Ann Coulter for speaking her mind. Sometimes I think she has a great amount of courage in saying the things she does. But I think too often she goes over the top. If only her approach were different.    I agree with Coulter that there are some on the far left that are doing America a great amount of harm but painting all liberals with a broad brush is not going to  help our situation.    We live in perilous times. Let's stay focused on our real enemies and stop the name calling.    Jim Connell   \\"Hallstatt Prince\\"	2005-05-14

However this is not your typical self help book.  Although many of the techniques elucidated in this book have long been known the presentation of how to employ these techniques is quite good. It is a book that I believe anyone can follow and use.  McKenna has been employed by the rich and famous to help them. Let him help you.   Speaking  from my own scientific background as a psychology major who did his graduate work in neuroscience (Princeton) and animal behavior (Max Planck Institute in Germany)  I see nothing in this book that runs contrary to what science knows about how the mind works.  This is not a \\"new age fad\\" and the author explains this by giving a brief history of hypnosis in both its use and misuse.  One of the great living Tibetan Buddhist lamas would continue to ask his pupils \\"where is your mind?\\" It is a question that is not as simple to answer as you might think if you reflect on it. I will rephrase by asking \\"are you driving your mind or is your mind driving you?  McKenna's techniques are sound and should help the reader get out of negative  behavioral loops into which we all often fall.  There is nothing sinister about self-hypnosis. It is one of the ways our mind works. Whether or not we are aware of it we are haphazardly  self-hypnotizing everyday. This book shows you how to take control of the process.  Those still in doubt after reading this review should check out other books on hypnosis by McKenna. This man is no \\"flash in the pan\\".  Read it and be helpless no more.	2005-05-14

Although the book is not an easy one it is a book well worth spending the time to read.  It does require  the reader's concentration but anyone making through it will be greatly rewarded. The size of the book though intimidating (over a thousand pages) does not represent  a detail to far flung theories and minutia so much as  a care that borders on compassion the author demonstrates for the average reader in laying down fundamentals. Many will have to brush up on their college mathematics but it is not an impenetrable book. It might be geared toward those with a background in science but I believe it is well worth the effort of the amateur to plow through. Those who spend their hours reading a dozen books that attack science would be wise to reevaluate their strategy and  read just one book like this one. Mathematics is a discipline. So is logical thinking. This book takes the reader through in a methodical way. Surrender your  math phobias as you are in the hands of a master. Penrose is a great writer and explainer of principles in physics.     For those of us disappointed at his attempts in the subject of neurosciences take heart for Penrose  here in this book is in his element. His presentation of concepts that by less gifted professors can at times  put students to sleep in lecture halls are very clear if we allow ourselves to be guided by Penrose from the beginning. Perhaps one lacking a scientific background might make a quicker read through of the book the first time (although I advise no flipping through and picking and choosing as some of the topics taken out of sequence might cause the readers head to spin if they have not been exposed to these concepts before) and then starting again at the beginning, this time with a pencil. It is all inclusive but never bores and when done one is able to see a big picture. A glorious picture.    For those that  prefer  the typical mainstream sciencebest sellers that tend to \\"dumb down\\" and be filled with analogies and hyperbole why settle for analogies that may or may not apply when one can get the complete story and the logic behind it. Indeed  those  who invest here time with this book, with its straight forward yet eloquent writing  and illustrations may find it more understandable than books written by scientists who stretch their writing abilities in an attempt to be better understood by the mainstream.  The book is also offered at an almost unreasonable bargain price for a book this size selling at a price in the same range as  skimpy \\"pop-Science books.  I make no pretense to represent myself as someone who completely understands everything that is presented in this volume but I have grown from reading it. I think most will if  they give it a chance. I know I will be returning to it.  If you purchase this book by all means do not neglect the footnotes!	2005-05-13

However the topic of how iron age people (especially the Celts) used artwork is no revelation to those of us who have kept current in modern Celt studies. That art objects for the Celts had  multiple uses and lived multiple lives  (the main thesis to this text)  is nothing particularly new. Some of us are in touch with  archeologists of active Celtic sites and  when archeologists discover almost all of the bronze votive horses found have one broken leg and it is broken in a similar way you get the idea that this was a manipulation  done with a purpose.

So at the very beginning  the book already had \\"my Irish up\\" so to speak.  Although Ellis is no Cunliffe (but then again who is?) he offers a number of interesting facts and plausible explanations that one usually does not find in many works on the Celts.  For those who have difficulty plowing through the works by the Classical Mediterranean world on the Celts Ellis does a very admirable job summarizing them and  distilling them.

Who the hell am I?... No one.\\"<br /><br />Indeed.<br /><br />Zen is something that is an easy thing to fake on the outside to the uninitiated.<br /><br />Warner is no Alan Watts. In my opinion he has nothing to offer to the literature on Zen.<br /><br />This may be a somewhat interesting autobiography  but it is no road map to enlightenment.<br /><br />Can one achieve enlightenment through punk rock and monster movies? I am sure they can. But there are two major parts to Zen and one of them is the practice, the discipline (a good introduction for those who are unfamiliar to Zen in the classic \\"Zen in the Art of Archery\\") and then finally the purity of action.<br /><br />It is unwise to confuse the hormones of youth with enlightenment. The chemicals of the body wax and wane and youth fades but if only one maintains their practice  they may achieve enlightenment.<br /><br />I patiently await the authors writing ten years from now to see if  his claim of enlightenment has lasted.<br /><br />It would have made an interesting autobiography if the author had left Zen out of it.<br /><br />As far as the author himself I wish him well but I do not think this book is anything other than a good yarn. For those looking for insights into Zen in this book please look else where.	2005-05-07

He is witty and insightful. He can also be boneheaded and boorish.   <br />He makes the mistakes  many of these book do on both sides of  preaching to the choir but this book is a cut above many of its type however and Savage in print is much more tolerable that Savage on the radio and he makes a good methodical presentation in this book. <br /> When looking at some of his barbs there is a lot of points he makes that truly contain pearls of wisdom. For example his comments on homeland security are just plain common sense.  <br />The title may be a hook to some and a turn off to others and it does not adequately describe the contents for Savage is not out to skewer only liberals. <br />The shockmeisters on both the right and the left are trying to shake America up. And I believe if the true liberal and true conservative despise something more than the other it should be the complacency of people that couldn't care less either way. At least I hope that is the case. <br />  Liberalism is not a \\"mental disorder\\" but can be but this is not exclusive to liberalism. It is the mindset that is found on both the right and the left to willingly believe any flimsy story  that supports one's rigid ideology that is the \\"disorder\\". More specifically it is not a mental disorder but a surrender of logic and a laziness in thinking. Logic is a discipline and it has rules. I believe that is what Savage is trying to say. Since he is a conservative he sees many liberals as not using basic logic. I have also found this to be true but this phenomena occurs on both sides. Of course this explanation is certainly nowhere near  half as funny as how Savage would express the problem with his broad brush. <br />I think both liberal and conservative  will get something out of this book as Savage is funny, does point out real problems and even offers solutions. <br />Recommended to conservatives, liberals that are not thin skinned and people that have an open mind.	2005-05-07

There seemed to be a lot of loose ends exposed  during the investigation and unfortunately they were not reflected in the commissions conclusions. I found myself alone among my friends on both the right and the left in my doubts. <br /> Apparently I was not alone.  <br />  In reading this book I felt outraged by the author yet I was glad to see the debate is not over. Some of it I found distasteful and yet the book nagged at me. And I am far from  a critic of the present administration. <br />This is my third attempt to review this book and yet I am sure I will fall short. However given my difficulty in asessing this book is to me a statement about how I am still digesting it. Books are meant to stimulate thought. For that reason I recommend it. That does not mean I agree with all of it. <br />This book raises some interesting points and far from being just a paranoid rant of conspiracy theories (which it is) it also surprisingly careful and logical in the way it shines light on the flaws of the 9/11 Commission.  <br />  However one of the ideas the author explores is the possibility that the Bush administration allowed the 9-11 attacks to happen to justify a war with Afghanistan and Iraq. This  part of the book is nonsensical. Think what you like of President Bush. Even if you think so little of the man to think he was capable of allowing the death of 3000 innocent Americans, the idea that an American president, a Republican President, would allow an attack to occur that would shut down Wall Street for four days is an idea that even the X-Files wouldn't touch. However... <br />  To those who dismiss this book as ONLY the promotion of conspiracy theories I will say this - wasn't the very event of 9/11 the product of a conspiracy? Wasn't the 9/11 Commission  investigating  one shadowy world, thatof the terrorists, and the inability of another shadowy world, the intelligence community, to thwart the attack? I have great admiration for those in our intelligence community but by the very nature of their work much  has to be kept secret. The Commission was investigating among other things the failures of our intelligence agencies. Does it make sense that we would be so forth coming with all of our secrets? Of course not. <br />I found the 9/11 Commission Report to be a tidy, tasteless and premature eulogy. It needed to be answered by other authors. <br />  I do not agree with much of this book in its finger pointing at the Bush administration yet this book is something much needed to spur debate.  <br />  I wished the book was shorter and more factual and I hope someone that is more level headed will in the future write a book in a similar vein. <br />  The events of 9-11 were too important to be tied up in the  nice little package of the 9-11 Commission Report and be forgotten. I would have been much more satisfied if in the end the 9-11 Commission did not publish their findings  and told us some of the material was just too sensitive to be released. I think we could have accepted that as a nation. <br />  The events of 9-11 were also much too important to be a football of partisan politics.  And saying this I chide both the author and those who are dismissive of this book. The author has suspicions that come from his own political bias but let's not shoot the messenger. We need to be considering as a nation all well reasoned arguments and evidence. <br />The author concludes we should be opening up a new investigation. I could not agree more. <br /> Some might find themselves at times angry with the author and his own spin. There are some parts of this book where I would recommend that the reader hold their nose  yet this book is an important part of a debate that should be continuing and not laid to rest.	2005-05-01

Although he may be a liberal he is not of that kind that are so common these days that bores us to tears or rabidly ranting at us. Jon Stewart's approach is far more palatable. Although he is a humorist   Stewarts approach goes along way in helping to depolarize a country that  has become so dangerously polarized. Instead of this being a liberal diatribe it is a happy hunt of sacred cows.

It is  factually very detailed but reads with the ease of a well written novel. <br />It is no really a book in praise of the Irish themselves but how the progression of history is not always a straight line and how Ireland was for a time  the guardian and transmuter of the collective knowledge of Western civilization.  <br />When I say the book is factual however truth be told many of the facts of the period in question are far more complex or, at other times,  far less clear than what is presented in this book. However the book never claims to be a complete history of the period. The author is writing with a purpose, a thesis to prove, and in the end he is successful. Despite its flaws it is a great achievement. <br /> The author   working from his thesis sometimes neglects many details in regard to the ancient Celts and the complexities of their contribution to what would become European civilization. Also some of the facts stated such as those concerning the life of St. Patrick are less clearly understood than what is presented in this book. But again it is one man's thesis and not a complete history of the period. When one writes a short book of this type to inform yet be accessible and enjoyable one has to make some trade offs. I think he makes the right choices in the selection of his focus.  <br />Some may criticize him for it but I find some of Cahill's attempts at drawing parallels from the period of time in Europe which he outlines to the problems of the present day refreshing and thought provoking. <br />There is quite a bit packed into this short book and it leaves the reader wishing for more and hopefully readers of this work will afterward be spurred on to explore this period in depth in the works of others. <br /> <br />	2005-04-29

At first this seemed to be just another \\"flavor of the month\\" Christian self improvement book of which many come and go. But this is somewhat a cut above a number of other books that have had their time.    <br />It is good book meant to be read slowly as daily meditations over a period of 40 days and is not intended to be read at the breakneck speed with which this reviewer read it. All the same even reading it this way I found some familiar yet well phrased gems. <br />Books like this , both good and bad come and go but this book appears to be   written in a tone useful for the period in which we now live. <br />There are a few problems with the book the most unfortunate one being a mild sense of self promotion coming from the author still although this may be seen by some as  slightly distasteful I believe it is something that can be overlooked. <br />One of the greatest self help books one could read if read in the right way is the Bible. I had a relative who would begin the book on the first day of the years and pace herself so that she would finish it on the last day of the year and then begin again. <br />My point in mentioning this piece of personal history is this - it is the combination of reading something which is motivating and well grounded spiritually while at the same time having the discipline to daily make it a part of your life that is a power combination and not exclusive to Christianity. Along with the messages the book gives this method is not new either but sometimes in the modern age we need   to have things repackaged to remind us. <br />Whatever works. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-29

This isn't the end it is the beginning. Don't panic!  <br />  It is science fiction as parody as science fiction. Although social commentary in science fiction is not new (indeed in my opinion one finds some of our best social critics to be writers of science fiction) Adams has a way of not only making it fun but  creating one layer on top of another  and the philosophies and barbs become as absurd as some of the polymorphous characters. The book presents a panorama of absurdity.  <br />This is book that could have only been written after the whiff of the 60s was still in the air but was not just for aging hippies. Some of it is indeed very silly and some of it bordering on the profound. Sometimes in reading this I was reminded of Lewis Carroll, not so much the Lewis Carroll of Alice in Wonderland but of Jabberwocky as the names and forms of some of the characters are very, well very \\"Jabberwocky\\" ( yes there is  even a character in the book named \\"Zaphod Beeblebrox\\"). <br />Throughout Dent's travels, which read very much like comedy skits, the author sometimes steps back and explains bit of arcana of the universe which always has some sort of off beat dead pan joke behind it. When this book first came out I remember many of the catch phrases like \\"Don't panic\\" on everyone's lips. <br />You will find Adams to be a great humorist. Even now as I refresh my memory by going over the book I read about 25 years ago I am laughing to myself. Adams is an original. At the time when I first read the  book it sometimes seemed so breezy and its catch phrases so easily absorbed by the popular culture I wondered if it was just somewhat of a fad, something that struck a cord in a generation (and only for that generation). My doubts were unfounded. <br /> In my opinion the work has stood the test of time. It sounds like hyperbole but who knows it a hundred years this book might be considered a true classic. <br />	2005-04-29

Some writers of books on the Celts that have been printed over the past twenty years would have benefited if they had consulted this book. <br />Its discussions of the origins of the Celts are fair-minded and the authors do not rush the reader to conclusions that cannot be with our present state of knowledge and were somewhat ahead of their time in pushing back the origins of the Celtic period further than what is usually presented in other works. <br />For the beginner it is not always an easy read but it is still approachable and the determined beginner would do well in reading this book as their first introduction to the history of the Celts. <br />The author's use of the Celtic bardic texts is commendable for they introduce the information they contain yet minimize them as far as being a reliable source of fact and history. <br />Explored are accounts of the Celts by the Classical world as well as a discussion of the first traces of the Celtic language. Social and religious aspects of the early Celts are also touched on. <br />Most of the book concentrates on the historical Celts of the British Isles. Their study of the religion, art and literature of the Celts of the British Isles is masterful. <br />A good companion to this book is Barry Cunliffe's \\"The Ancient Celts.\\"	2005-04-28

Although this novel is not quite up to the quality of her first novel The Secret Life of Bees she is someone whose career I believe is going to be interesting to watch as I think her best work is yet to come.     To say she has a way with words is an understatement and to read her prose is a joy. There always seems to be something bubbling up from the collective consciousness that finds its way into best selling novels. The Mermaid's Chair is no exception to this phenomena for the themes of guilt, loss, the feelings of responsibility of one's aging parents and the wish of a second chance that figure prominently in this novel are subjects which the majority of we baby boomers are now grappling. But perhaps even more important in the lives of many of my generation (be they Christian or non-Christian) being now older and wiser is the subject of forgiveness and that is another theme in this novel. The forgiveness of one's self and of others. <br /> The novel begins with the protagonist (Jessie) learning that her mother purposely  cuts off her own finger . And so Jessie goes back home. It is not a journey to which she looks forward. But for her it becomes a place where mysteries of the heart unfold and the contradictions of her past resolve themselves in the most unexpected of ways. <br /> <br />Thought provoking and entertaining.	2005-04-27

Many of these concepts are not new but they are packaged well and   sometimes what it takes for information to be useable and useful is a good teacher. Greene is a good teacher. <br />   Green has us looking at the world in a different way, it is a way that although one might see as being as old as Machiavelli (or as many may learn from this book much much older), is   seen more easily made manifest in today's information age. This is a psychological and historical tretise on a specific aspect of human interaction: power. <br />Rather than take credit for these ideas he makes a historical survey of some of the ideas expounded in the past on achieving power as well as their masters and proponents. <br />Power is something taken advantage of and applied not only in the hard knuckle world of business but in all aspects of human life such as love. Actually there are somethings about the human condition exposed in this book which many may not want to know. <br />   There are some moral cross currents that run through this book.    There are also sometimes what appear to be contradictions. Rather than be confused by them I invite the reader to take them as koans or verses on which to meditate. Somewhat of a disclaimer runs between the lines of this work as if the book had a warning label on it (\\"For the thinking person with a fairly well developed conscious only\\"). The author attempts to present many of these concepts as \\"laws\\" of human behavior. We are left to draw our own conclusions as to how to use this information. In this way his approach is not only practical it has much akin to studies in human ethology. <br />An excellent book. <br />	2005-04-26

He grows up in California but is haunted by memories of his homeland and of his best friend who he believes he betrayed.

Themes like the love  between father and son, a citizen and one's country elevate this book. The prose is delightful and is highly descriptive but not flowery.

I am writing this review so you won't have to read this book. I am a humanitarian.  I think both Jane Fonda fans and haters  will be disappointed with this book.  This book attempts to be an autobiography and yet Fonda gave two of her husbands the opportunity to redact the text. These are not just \\"sins of omission\\" (if you will excuse the pun) they are calculated which begs the question as to how much of the rest of this book is calculated.  It is the story of a poor little Hollywood rich girl.  She tells of an emotionally distant father. It is familiar problem of the generation she was raised in...next!  Her mother was committed to a mental institution. I am not without sympathy.  She finds herself trying to live up to the Fonda name. Everyone has their problems.  She marries Roger Vadim and invites other women into their marital bed. Now I am not a member of the stratified world of the rich and famous but didn't the author have an inkling of what she was doing to herself? I don't have the right to judge anyone but her explanation of the unusual marriage just doesn't quite ring true.    It makes one wonder if she is indeed an air head and not the Commie provocateur many of our vets have made her out to be. (She apologies in the media  now for her posing at the seat of a North Vietnamese antiaircraft gun just in time for the release of her book.) Jane was and continues to be confused.     It sounds like she truly had an awful childhood. There are many who had awful horrific childhood  that didn't have a father with a household name.    Have you noticed the Fonda media blitz lately? If you haven't take a look at the photograph of the letter by none other than Jane Fonda on this very page addressed to Amazon readers. This is shameless self-promotion. I addition there is the new movie starring Jane Fonda and a flood of  interviews. If I were this woman's therapist I would tell her she is feeding her own demons.This isn't a book, it is a screenplay, it is the autohagiography of Jane Fonda. Jane Fonda is still a self obsessed star.    I would be a lot less severe with this book if it weren't for the over the top hype and the self glorification that shows in every page.    The titles of the sections are so grandiose it makes one wonder if Jane Fonda has even begun to examine her problems.  If you want to read about an outspoken feminist who was intelligent, raised consciousness and had a rough life read works by and about Andrea Dworkin.  If you want to read about a celebrity who was outspoken intelligent and beautiful read works by and about Grace Slick. Is she beloved for maintaining her integrity? Any one remember the tommyhawk chop she did with her billionaire husband for his baseball team? And her explanations of these events again just do not ring true.  Today's NYT bestseller list has this book listed as being number one. It is enough to make one pull out  one's hair by the roots. This person was not a Nobel prize winner,  this was not a woman with complex and original political thoughts. Art makes up for a multitude of sins though - if she was one of our leading actors I would understand the adulation but this woman was not one of our great actors.  This is a woman whose entire profession was made in manipulating the media (for whatever reason). She has done it again.  Jane Fonda has become somewhat of a lightening rod. I hoped this book would made her a more understandable figure.  It doesn't.	2005-04-23

Although I am in not complete agreement with all of his ideas (such as his opinions of liberation theology which although his criticisms of it are well taken I believe the churches stand could have been modified could have been modified to accommodate   both a continuation of the struggle for the poor of Latin America while at the same time condemning Marxism) he presents them well.   This book show a man dedicated to preserving the main essence of Catholicism and to continue to make it a refuge and alternative to the excesses of the modern world while at the same time building bridges of understanding to other faiths. It seems as though some of the most important \\"bridge-buiding projects\\" that the church will have to undertake is not with other religions or some exotic lands but to the West which actively does its best not to understand the Catholic church and obscure its message. <br />  The book is a both a call of alarm and a message of hope. I believe hope is the quality that shines through most in this book. <br />   One of the great messages of this book is that Catholicism is a faith not dictated by a hierarchy but a dialogue between the clergy and the faithful.

Many of the artifacts shown are seen in many other books about the Celts but they are of a better quality and seem to be lit somewhat differently than the pictures we usually see of these artifacts.  The text is brief but good. I have a few small quibbles with a few of the facts presented but in truth that would be an unfair criticism as their is only so much that can be included in the summery like chapters. The space given really does not give the author the room for some of the debates in Celtic studies. So taken that way he gives an excellent presentation for the little room he is given.

The white smoke proved Allen wrong. <br /> <br />   Among many of the suppositions the author made in this book one was that Cardinal Ratzinger because of this theology would never become a Pope. He was wrong. <br />   The author as a liberal Catholic is quite tainted in his beliefs and cannot be trusted as an impartial biographer. However I would not go so far as to call the book an attack as Allen may be of the Catholic left but certainly not of the Catholic far left. No matter if one is Catholic or not one can ffollow the logic that if you change some of the major underpinnings of a thing, be it a religion or any other institution, that thing ceases to be what it was. Whether to are a Catholic, an anti-Catholic or somewhere in the middle it is hard to deny, if you have a modicum of knowledge about the faith one knows that at least in its dogma, it its major tenants, it has been consistent in its two thousand years of existence. The subtitle of this book \\"The Vatican's Enforcer of the Faith\\" is telling therefore because what seems as some to be an enforcer may merely be someone with enough backbone to insure the continuity of the faith. <br />   Useful is the background and history of the man which is done somewhat meticulously. I have no way of knowing this but I do believe there are certain aspects of Ratzinger's history that deserve further examination. <br />   Although I recommend this book with reservations I do not see it as something that will give non-Catholics better insight into the Catholic Church. <br />   This book is somewhat unfair and biased but I believe one can gain insight into the new Pope through this book if one reads between the lines. Rather than trust the author's selection of Ratzinger's writings and his analysis of them I suggest the fair minded personal to read Ratzinger's writings in their complete form and draw their own conclusions. I recommend this book   if it is only read in addition to Cardinal Ratzinger's own books.	2005-04-20

It is almost forty years old and yet it is as relevant today as it was when it was first published. <br />  The Pope John Paull II is a tough act to follow. We first met him as a strong middle aged man who reached out to the young and built bridges between Catholicism and other faiths. There may be therefore some trepidation now that the Catholic church suddenly has a 78 year old German Pope. To make matters worse the Catholic haters have filled the Internet with rumors and half truths of Ratzinger's membership in the Hitler Youth. <br /> Anyone who reads this book will find it a comfort as we see in Ratzinger  a man very much like the late John Paul II who like the recently deceased Pope is a scholar, mystic and humanitarian. And like John Paul II he is a principled man with backbone. And by that I mean not an unbending man but a man of conviction. <br />  This book works on many levels as it is both scholarly and approachable. <br />  Ratzinger uses the Apostle's creed as a jumping off point. He dusts it off and has us look at it in various ways. This approach is help not only to the Catholic but to all Christians and  to any non-Christian who wants to gain insight into Christianity. It is an approach where he refers to and elucidates on both the mystical and the practical nature of man. <br />  Rather than being the stodgy figure some of the media has been painting him to be Ratzinger has his moments of cleverness and humor in this book which makes it all the more appealing.Yet as I said it has its scholarly side for Ratzinger not only refers to Catholic theologian but numerous philosophers from various periods and cultures to draw his points home. Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, shows in this book that he has the tools and the desire to continue the work of John Paul II to build bridges while keeping the doctrine of the Catholic Church intact. <br /> <br />I strongly recommend this book to all.	2005-04-20

If it were not for the skillful writing of the author I don't think I would have made it through the 700 plus pages. It is a through and well researched account of seriously flawed personalities and greed. Part's of the he book reads like a who's who of business and politics. Most of us who read the papers are well aware of how far-fetched and preposterous the schemes to defraud went at Enron but Eichenwald takes us from the very beginning to show how things snow balled in this company. <br /> One cannot help but think though that in reading this book the author received somewhat of a \\"snow-job\\" from those he interviewed and in that way it left this reader somewhat skeptical of some parts of the story. His portrayal of the somewhat in the dark Ken Lay and the scheming but imbalanced Skilling for me does not quite pass the smell test. The style which makes the book successful and an interesting read also makes some of its information seem less than credible. We rely much on the authors interviews of the principle players. I do not in the least question the authors motives but do not know enough about the author as whether or not he possesses a high enough degree of common sense and analytical ability to discern whether or not some of the smoothies in this book are just working him as an another client. The title is telling and begs the questions as was this really in the classic sense a series of conspiracies and were the men involved really fools. In that way the text doesn't quite live up to the title. <br /> There is something to be said though for a \\"don't rock the boat\\" philosophy portrayed in this book as it seems to be a virus that infects many an institution, financial and otherwise. <br />    In this way the book has somethig of the flavor of a morality play to it. People usually know they should tell the truth but many are not willing to accept the consequences for doing so. <br /> A well written book worthy of attention.

I am disappointed that it did not stay on the best sellers lists longer.     The book is comprehensive but by no means complete but how could it be. It is a subject worthy of many books to make up for the lack of newsprint for the problem.     The problem? It is not that I have something against the Chinese people and certainly the Chinese culture is one of the greatest cultures that the planet has produced.     It is not that I do not have sympathy for the over one billion people of that country. I do and it is one of the reasons why I am against not the growth of the Chinese economy but the growth of an economy of a  brutal belligerent country in possession of a large stockpile of nuclear weapons.    if we were talking about a country which is trying to enter the modern world that is now becoming a success I would tip my hat. But China is still ruled by old men who desire to dominate the Pacific region not just through trade but through their military.     It started in the late eighties (it  certainly by 1990) that I noticing everything sold in this country was being made in China. I remembered well the protests for freedom in Tienamin Square and how they were was brutally crushed. I was quite aware from Tibetan friends how China continued their campaign of cultural extermination in Tibet. I believe it was in 1990 I began to boycott Chinese goods. In 1991 my wife gave me a halogen lamp. On its bottom was a label \\"Made in Chain (sic)\\" It would have been humorous if I didn't find it so ominous.  In 1993 I traveled via Nepal to Tibet.

Although I suggest you read his first two books before reading this one but if you read only one book by Carlos Castaneda this is the book to read. Be his books accurate reporting by a cultural anthropologist (which is becoming increasingly more and more doubtful), mysticism or hokum, this particular book is quite moving and lyrical. And whether his stories are real or imagined and whether the teaching he transmutes came from Don Juan or from his own mind by his knowledge as a trained anthropologist the underlying mystical principles of these stories cannot be dismissed out of hand.   Shaman, poet and perhaps an academic scoundrel it is Castaneda's poetry and story telling that comes shining through in this book.   If Castaneda's books were a hoax and were represented as cultural anthropology as a better hook to sell books it is a shame because he did a disservice to science and to his legacy. Still I myself, as a former researcher in Harvard University's anthropology department and a student of human ethology, can forgive this sin on one level and enjoy this book as a powerful work of liturature.     For if there has been a wrong that has been committed against anthropology it is one that was done by the way the books were marketed and perhaps by the author's personality itself. The works themselves should not suffer and be shunned  for this.   His legacy would have been better served if he wrote these same works as a writer of fiction.   I believe the author would have been wiser to present his works the way Gurdjieff presented \\"Beelzebub's Tales to his Grandson\\" rather than obstinately insisting there really was such a person as Don Juan (even if in the off chance that his teacher did exist).     Despite the controversy his writing stands on its own and Journey to Ixtlan is a powerful, touching, enchanting and beautiful book.	2005-04-17

An interesting an approachable introduction to Robert Anton Wilson his associates and his heroes. Remarkably it offers a touching view of the man as well.  A good introduction to Wilson's philosophy and the philosophy of his cronies . In it Wilson takes his place with other the mystical   impresarios of modern times: Crowley, Gurdjieff and Leary.  Crowley Gurdjieff and Leary are featured prominently in this book as well as such topics as conspiracy theories, aliens, yoga, the use of drugs to gain enlightenment (although I would not call this a \\"druggie\\" book) and numerology (especially the significance of the number 23). However this is not a scholarly book and probably was not mean to be. It seems to be written as an introduction for some while for others it seems to be a preaching to the choir yet since the at least 25 years of the book I can't help but think it is also more than that.    Through a good half of the book Wilson keeps up the spooky pace. However the presentations of various archana pop in an out of the book in a less than a cohesive format and some parts of the books seem to unravel. Wilson's writing style is pretty simplistic and sometimes down right sloppy yet behind all of the flaws one comes away with the feeling   that Wilson is an important and original thinker (one cannot help but think too from reading this book that the author is his own biggest fan). Also I cannot help but thin that the mix of fiction, mysticism and soul searching biography is all intentional as a device to shock the reader into another way of looking at things. For if this was the authors intention it succeeds.  In away the book is a somewhat different approach to his \\"Illuminati\\" trilogy also I think he is more successful in drawing us into \\"Chapel Perilous\\" through his fiction than through this book.  The great surprise to the book is it's climax, the Cosmic Trigger itself, which is the death of his daughter and his reaction to it. Because despite all of the spooky topics it delves into the most important one is the love of a father for a child and forgiveness. Despite Wilson's review and embrace of what some might call the occult the most important and poignant part of this book is more in tune to the basic tenets of Christianity.  I am not quite sure if Wilson is aware of it or sees a contradiction or perhaps he maybe telling us that there is a unifying principle to all of it.  The book is pretty quirky. Wilson portrays himself as a skeptic but his writing  betrays him as being far from a skeptic. Sometimes he takes himself with great serious while other times he is down right self deprecating. Through all of its mad mess the book comes across as being quite charming in the end and in its own way enlightening.  When it first came out it was an important book of its day as it helped to introduce many to the works of such people as Crowley and Gurdjieff, names that are now again part of the mainstream.  Perhaps I should put this down on my list of   \\"guilty pleasures\\" but I thoroughly enjoyed this book.	2005-04-17

The story of one of those peculiar lives that was more like fiction than  reality. Rice brings to life the biography of this neglected figure of history. A linguist, explorer, notorious rake and transmuter of eastern literature  to the West (the original translator of \\"The Karma Sutra\\") Burton was unique and yet a man of his times. For the Victorian era was filled with many flamboyant individuals who went against the moral grain. (Anyone who has studied the complexities of the Victorian era knows that our current usage of the word \\"Victorian\\" as synonym for the word \\"Puritanical\\" is quite incorrect.) I think his life style would have been a scandal even by today's standards. For example since when is the last time you heard that the best way to study a language is by being the patron of a brothel? <br />   The book is a tome, complete and authoritative, and comes complete with numerous photos including an unforgettable one of Burton being nagged by his wife and of Burton's final resting place, the famous tent grave.  However one cannot help feel as though a little more careful editing could have helped to shorten this book to make it more readable and still maintain its integrity. And despite the book being long and well researched one cannot help but think there was even more, much more to this man than is revealed here. Many currently published books often indulge in unnecessary and speculative half-baked psychology. But a little more psychological extrapolation of the subject of this book might have been a good thing and may have made the book more digestible.  <br />However these are minor quibbles. This is a most enjoyable book on many levels. <br />Recommended. <br /> <br />Jim Connell	2005-04-17

The tradition does go back earlier much earlier than the days of television   but since the OJ trial America has a rabidly ghoulish fascination with murder trials in progress that has given rise such things as the cable channel Court TV. <br />   It seems like every day on the news   we are exposed to an endless parade of the dregs of humanity. Has the television become the modern day pillory? Why are we so fascinated? Does it give us comfort that the bad guys are caught or does our comfort come from seeing that there might be people worse than our ownselves out there? In someway these super trials that dominate the media these days are sideshows that distract us from the real issues we should be dealing with.  <br />   That being said Catherine Crier is good at what she does and she does a great job of breaking down and factually presenting the case. <br />  Personally I was sick of this case as it seemed every single bit of it was replayed over and over in the news. However if you read this book you will find there was even more to this sad story to know. <br />   What made America have such a fixation on this case? I think it is a combination of things and the way that each day   the media unpeeled one layer of the onion after another even before the trial. Initially it was the heartbreaking story of a missing pregnant woman, then the bizarre actions of her husband, the sudden appearance of the husband's mistress and through it all we finally are overwhelmed with evidence that the charming well groomed Scott is not exactly the boy next door. <br />   If you are not overly tired of the media supersaturation of this trial I recommend it.	2005-04-16

The primary   message of this book is that modern culture is pounding us on all sides and parents should be able to control its influence on their children. Well, on the face of it I can't argue with that. Along with our culture becoming too violent, over sexed and too loud the worst offense modern American culture commits on our young is, in my opinion, it is too dumb and   mediocre. So some of the advice this book should come as no surprise to anyone who is sound of mind. In my generation the television became sort of electronic baby sitter. A bigger threat right now is the computer which   some parents also can use as an electronic   baby sitter and which can easily invite a real life predator into your home.     Not wanting for your child to read sexual material   one thing but if you come from a house hold where reading material for those under the age of 18 must conform to religious dogma including the classics that is just another form of child abuse.     In my day one of the big evil everyone warned parents about was rock and roll. Well, for the most part we all made it through rock and roll OK.     Parents must protect their children. And American culture is ubiquitous and overwhelming not only our homes but across the planet (I will restrain myself from going on a rant about how American culture is destroying some of the cultures of the rest of the world).      As a parent you probably should give this book a look. Unfortunately I think those who already have enough concern to buy this book are already aware of the problem. I do not agree with all of the authors ideas and I don't think many would like to, or benefit from, growing up in the type of draconian household the author proposes nevertheless there are some good ideas here and they should be considered and applied to fit your family's value system. But that being said the ideaof \\"just as long as your under my roof you live by my rules\\" if applied inflexibly from your child's infancy to their late teen years is a strategy that in many homes is doomed to fail. As a child grows they learn and take on responsibilities and with that it goes to follow more and more freedoms should be given.     The television is really a type of monster and no matter what your rules are anyone who has been around kids knows that whatever mom and dad watches the kids will watch even if they are told not to.      Personally I would make more an emphasis of leading by example as a parent and have it known that the TV is a device that is only used in case of emergency. There has to be a balance though. One does not want to stifled a child's natural curiosity and raise a group of dullards. So the problem is not as simple as is stated in this book. For example I myself benefited by watching the news every night with my parents (it sometimes gave me nightmares but that is another story) and I am sure it contributed to the love of history, politics and culture that I have today. But we know live in a world where even the news has become tasteless (in recent memory there have been all sorts of things on the news that a child should not be exposed to like when in the mid 80's a political official blew his head off on live TV). There is too much emphasis on the word \\"no\\" in this book and not enough on how much we should talk to children in a well reasoned way when they are confronted with disturbing things. And we should talk with our children instead of at them to try to be in tune with their emotional and intellectual progress.   Unless you put a bag over your child's head they are eventually going to be exposed to things you don't want them to be exposed to.     One of my solutions to the problem is to fill your house with books (for example like the Great Books series put out by Britanica). Take your children to museums. Have art in your home. Bring them out on nature hikes. Two can play at this game of cultural warfare.     I will add this as well. Children must be protected but have a natural need to grow and later to fit in with society and have a dialogue with society. You don't want to set your kids up in a totally shielded environment to become prey to a world they are not prepared for. I remember a number of friends who grew up in shielded homes who went on to be total reprobates when they went off to college.     So my recommendation is that parents should read this book and extract from it what they think is useful but do not use it as a manual by which you run your household.   Three and a half stars.

(More than about Zen)	The book isn't really about archery but  Zen but I think just about everybody knows that by now. As well as being about Zen it is a self help book for if you never read another book about Zen or take up the practice you will benifit from reading this book. In it is the humble opinion of this reviewer  if you read only one \\"self help book\\" this is the one to read. It is a powerful book that is as much about human psychlogy as it is about anything.  <br />  it is a must read and must be experienced to be appreciated but that being said let me elaborate on some of the topics in the book. <br />  The bow is difficult to bend and so one must practce again and again to bend it. That is just one task of archery that is broken down in Zen archery training. Instead of the initiate begining by shooting an arrow at a target, every step of the task is broken down and each practiced until each is perfected. <br />  This I would call the \\"neurotic\\" side of Zen. For by one interpretation neurosis that is not unbriddled or pathologic is necessary in the careful preparation for  tasks. <br />Too many (especially of my generation) see Zen as an \\"anything goes\\" phiolosophy which is in my mind far from the truth. <br />  So after the repitition of each of the various indivual parts of the process of archery is repeated  over and over. The archer is finally ready. A this point  (not to sound overly mystical) the archer, the arow and the target become one. <br />You don't have to be a mystic to get the mesage here. <br />  Part of what the book describes is the psychological process called \\"chaining\\" but this book takes that process to a new height. <br />  A book that is much more practical and concise than the 2005 best seller \\"Blink\\". <br />I recommend that everyone read it and an reflect on it.	2005-04-16

At the date of the writing of this review a number of the concepts introduced in this book have now found there way into the mainstream. Nevertheless I believe the book so far has survived the test of time.       Along with being a book about the new science it is a book about how a new science comes together and the later is an interesting topic in and of itself.       They are also some amusing tales of some of the various characters (a type I know well) that hold their devotion to science above a concern of appearing as eccentrics. Not all scientists are social misfits but one of the insights this book gives to the general public is that many scientists are totally oblivious to social conventions and this trait is not an affectation but  an unfortunate consequence of their dedication to pursuing scientific truths.    Four and a half stars.  Highly recommended.	2005-04-16

An accessible well written enjoyable work on economics that offers unique insights to today's big questions. It is a timely work with which ever reader should become familiar. <br />  When I was an undergraduate, although I studied the hard sciences, I found economics to be the most impenetrable counterintuitive subjects I had ever encountered. I wish I had this book then. <br />  But this is much more than a book about economics as the authors offer new perspectives about just about everything through economic theories. Some of the underlying ideas are not completely new but even those are brought to a satisfying fruition. This book gives the reader a unique view of the world through an economist's eyes. Events which seem disconnected or driven by other influences are revealed with great clarity as having basic economic principles behind them. Through this vision the world, a world which sometimes seems in chaos, becomes a web of underlying economic principles. <br />A winner. <br /> <br />	2005-04-15

It seems to reflect an introspection by the American people about their destiny.     \\"Collapse\\" is one such book. But that being said I believe it should be read as a series of  vignettes in history and what they might mean when we consider the future rather than being read  as a type of well reasoned, if subliminal, prophecy. It is a more enjoyable I believe if the reader takes in the information that is presented in a very pleasing fashion and draw their own conclusions.    Diamond is author of the very popular book \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\"  and whose name is probably very familiar to anyone that haunts bookstores. Anyone familiar with the aforementioned book knows that Diamond is not afraid to give an occasional poke in the eye to formerly established theories. But Jared Diamond's approach to history comes from his unique perspective as a physiologist and geographer. His ideas, although sometimes in conflict with such traditional noted historians as William McNeill, are quite thought provoking. Sometimes it takes an outsider from a different discipline to shake things up a bit. His books remind me of the recent movement in leading universities to create \\"centers\\" that coexist with departments to take a multidisciplinary appraoch to fileds such as neuroscience that cross departments.    It is well worth reading and its ideas well worth considering however I find the title of the book to be slightly misleading, historical events somewhat \\"cherry-picked\\" and some of the conclusions to be a little bit of a stretch. My advice is to read it with an open mind. However there is one message of this book that is very much worth remembering and is timely: societies that are inflexible are destined to fail.

(and then some)	There are two ways of approaching a review of this book: slowly and logically or by taking some blotter acid and  to begin hammering on the keyboard. <br /> Thompson did something new in modern American journalism by putting the author and his immediate perceptual experiences in the center of the story itself and father a style of writing known as \\"Gonzo journalism\\". <br />   The novel tells the story of a man Raoul Duke (Thompson's pen name) traveling to an assignment. With him he takes for company and legal advice (many times unsolicited)   a 300 pound Somoan attorney named Gonzo. But an on a business trip needs one needs a little entertainment. In this case   the entertainment come in the form of a suitcase full of various hallucinogenic drugs which the two consume in short order. But this is not just a tale of a joy ride of two doped up thrill seekers. <br /> The assignment takes place in Las Vegas not only one of the most patently absurd cities in the world but also a totally artificial city which lies in the middle of a waste land.  <br />   It is from a never ending drug induced haze Thompson makes him report. But here we get to very idea of perception. Every author writes from a certain perspective where it be his own academic training or from his personal experiences. And when we read that idea is an understood or should be. One might see the book as an account of his overindulgent drug use and   hallucinations the story he pursues as just a device. But it is also a commentary about reportage in general. Further the book is social commentary. Set in a time after the high-water mark of the counterculture has receded it takes place affectionately known as \\"Sin City\\" where everything is legal as long as you have the money and are one of the squares.  <br />   So we have our two whacked out hero's tripping their brains out upon their arrival in a town devote to every fantasy and by its very nature it a fantasy made reality by the modern miracle of electric power. As Thompson has his visions and waking nightmares he wanders through a quite real human freakshow where overindulgence is a lifestyle. How absurd is the fantasy image of people turning into reptiles next to the reality of casino doubling as a circus? <br />   The idea of putting the author putting himself front and center in the middle of a quest may have rocked the boat in 20th century America but one can draw comparisons from the past. Boswell's London Journal comes to mind as Boswell, in writing of his quest for his hero Samuel Johnson, deviates often from that story in telling us of his sexual adventures. However Thompson has upped the ante in the respect of blurring the line between fantasy and reality. I believe we have to go further back to the medieval writings of some of the mystics who were under the influence of spirituality where their visions and reality are blurred. <br />   Many of you who are taken aback by Thompson's drug use might not be aware that   Edna St. Vincent Millay, well embraced by the general public, used a variety of drugs in her later years for the very purpose of aiding her in the creative process. <br />   The book has been somewhat of a manifesto for years by the drug culture but that is no reason for the novel to be avoided or disparaged. <br />Along with the wonderfully ludicrous hallucinations and the situations brought about by them is sharp social and political commentary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-14

That being said Crumb's status as an artist, from the days when he was one of the pioneers of the underground comic book to today when the New Yorker gives him multiple color pages, continues to grow.   No less of an art critic than Robert Hughes (\\"The Shock of the New\\") lauds Crumb as one of the greatest living artists of our times.     Although some of his work is not for the faint of heart (sometimes being sexually graphic while at other times   being emotionally and psychologically challenging) I recommend this work to anyone that can take it (adults only). I especially recommend it to any student of art. To say the sexually graphic images of R. Crumb's have no redeeming value is to entirely miss the point as through his words and illustrations he is a unique social critic. Indeed some of the shocking aspects of his art are wake up calls that jolt the soul.     This volume is a great overview of Crumb but it is by no means complete and true hard-core Crumb fans might be disappointed at some slight omissions in his biography. Indeed a more complete autobiography is contained in the complete opus of Crumb's artwork. Nevertheless I highly recommend this book to every adult.     Robert Crumb is truly an individual   I would like to know personally.   He is in many ways a contradiction (or perhaps so he would like us to believe). As self admitted misanthrope his cartoons show a man who is quite the opposite. For although his work can be quite brutal he again and again through his work betrays his sympathy for the human condition. Many times depicting women is what I will put delicately as \\"compromising situations\\" and charactures I believe it is not so much that Crumb is a misogynist (which he has called himself) but a sympathetic as well autobiographical commentary on how women are viewed and treated in society.   Crumb always has been self deprecating yet is obviously aware of his place in art.The book comes complete with CD of Crumb's music and makes for a nice package (in a strange way by ths mulitmedia approach living up to the title). Put the CD in the player and listen as you slowly absorb the life, views and most importantly the art of R. Crumb.	2005-04-14

As an American I find it hard to take that after the events of 9-11-01 we as a country have slipped back into complacency. But what also surprises me is that no one in the government quite seems to understand that the rules of the big game have changed. <br />   It is about time a book like this has come along.   David Hunt is stark and no nonsense in his presentation of the dangers America is now facing. His presentation is frank not hysterical and comes complete with numerous documents published for the first time to back up his contentions.    <br />    Hunt himself has the credentials to speak to these issues and is no lightweight.  A senior research fellow at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard he is recognized expert in the field of terrorism as well as being a military veteran of many years.  <br />   Be you a hawk a dove or somewhere in the middle this portion of the book alone makes the book a must read for everyone today.  <br />   But I will go further to say that although Col. Hunt is   hawkish (a better word for the times in which we live might be pragmatic)   I think all of the main ideas he presents here, our complacency, the weakness of our leaders, our willingness to please the rest of the world to the point of our own determent (in a world where the consequences could be unimaginable) and having bureaucracy in this country that borders on the Byzantine are all problems every reader, be they hawk or dove, should consider. <br />   Col. Hunt not only points out the mistakes we are making in the war on terror and our foreign policy but has some solutions. And in that way this is not really a \\"gloom and doom\\" book but something which is hopeful. Further he offers practical advice on how to protect one's own family. Whether you agree with his solutions or not this is a book that must be examined and discussed. <br /> <br />Jim Connell	2005-04-14

But it was not the baseball team that was  \\"on fire\\".  Cosell was speaking  of a fire in a  nearby a neighborhood.             <br />  If it were not for our knowing now how the story of the city played out it almost reads as though the new Rome, like the old Rome, was collapsing. <br />  Written with a gripping style Mahler tells the story of a baseball team struggling for success while the city in which it is located is coming apart at the seams. <br />  As Billy Martin is trying his best to whip together the Yankees, and while the famous dance at Studio 54, the Big Apple was rotting from the inside out. <br />  These were the days of the Son of Sam, a blackout and the riots that ensued and an economic crisis gripped New York City (it was only two years before the time this book is set in when the famous headline appeared \\"Ford to New York: Drop Dead\\"). It was also a time when Watergate and the national soul searching that followed was still in our collective memories. A time that gave America pause to reflect on its limitations. And so did New York. <br />  The city's passion for baseball makes for an interesting device and analogy to both the chaos and hopes of a city in crisis. <br />  Although the book ends in a somewhat less than satisfying way I enjoyed it and recommend it.	2005-04-12

Like the old adage goes that begins \\"for want of nail a shoe was lost, for want of a shoe a horse was lost\\" so goes the idea behind The Tipping Point. Every one knows that story but few meditate on its full implications and that the results can be positive as well as the negative.  The tipping point strongly presents how one minor event can cascade into chaos, revolution, mass movements, trends in style and innovation. There was in the sixties a catch phrase within the counterculture that \\"a single match can cause a brush fire\\" and Gladwell offers a great beginning to the  exploring the mechanics of how one minor event can cause a brush fire of changes. <br />  Describing how ideas can work like a virus (the application of this idea to language is certainly not a new) the thesis has implications to all fields <br />and in my mind offers a caution to slackers as well as an inspiration to genius. The Tipping Point shows not only how minor actions can cause this cascade but how entropy can as well.  <br />  But the book does not stop there as it explains how networks and the quality of those networks contribute to this phenomena. <br />  Further the author shows the a sociological and psychological implications and the breeding grounds to change: how certain individuals are more likely to cause the cascade as well how certain groups, societies and countries are more vulnerable to this phenomena. Gladwell being a writer for The New Yorker comes from one such organization where in this country the publication is a powerful engine for change. But it is not the quantity  of newsprint that causes this phenomena (as to continue the example other publications have greater circulation) it is rather the people and networks that the publication touches. <br /> The three main points or keys to his thesis on the way this phenomena works are: the  stickiness factor, the law of the few, and power of context. From my perspective these points is just a beginning (but a very good beginning) that I hope will be explored further by other authors. <br /> After reading this book one comes away with a new realization how certain things become trends, how a rumor can run rampant on the Internet and how conspiracy theories can sometimes dominate a rational world. <br />  I find it an intersting companion to another best seller \\"The World is Flat\\". <br />  It is a book that offers key insights that offer both hope as well as a word of caution. I find the book particularly timely. I hope that this book itself will become itself a \\"tipping point\\" and I will endeavor to keep some its ideas in the forefront of my mind. <br />  <br />	2005-04-12

Clever and beautiful Alice Hoffman's The Ice Queen is an exploration into the human psyche. Having moments of sheer brilliance the characters of this work come to life in a masterful way. <br />  After the loss of her mother when she was a child, a loss she blames herself for as one could think only a child could,  the protagonist becomes rigid and emotionally devoid. Her reaction is understandably modern response as many today insulate themselves into not feeling anything rather than feeling both pleasure and pain. It is also the response found often in traumatized children.  However some of the themes of this book actually harken back to the works of the ancient Greeks.  <br />  Her brother becomes a meteorologist in contrast to \\"the ice queen\\" and here we have two approaches to our lives: the logical and the mystical. <br />  However her wishes again become reality as an adult when she is struck by lightening. So is the ice queen omnipotent or hounded by the Furies? <br />  First believing she caused a death, then as an adult surviving death she find herself seeking out a man nicknamed \\"Lazerus\\" who was also struck by lightening. Ah, the Gods! <br />  Through it all the ice queen journeys on a path of enlightenment.  <br />  This is my first exposure to Alice Hoffman's work and I find it both enchanting and intellectually satisfying.

Although a good page turned I believe the success of this book is not so much the ideas presented or the mastery of the writer. It comes more from it being a touchstone for the times we live in a world where it has become particularly harder to figure out the world especially after 9-11. Also contributing to its success is perhaps the current  backlash in our society against both Christianity and science where the X-Files is still fresh in our collective memory (\\"The truth is out there\\").  The DaVinci Code is an interesting exciting novel but nothing more. Unfortunately many are  to quick to accept the book as (if you will excuse the pun) Gospel, or more accurately said, history. History is full of arcana and DaVinci himself being one of the most intriguing and mysterious figures of the Western world has become a lightening rod of many a conspiracy theory. So to have DaVinci to play a role in plot is not new. Neither is the idea that Christ had a child by Mary Magdelane an idea that has been kicking around for quite sometime. It is one of but many ideas of those over the years that attempt to poke holes in Christianity (for those wishing to do so it is suggested to frame your arguments in logic rather than in conspiracy theories). For those interested in historical arcana pick your arcana wisely as odd disjointed facts are malleable to an infinite number of ways. Further examination of the facts soon debunk many of the ideas presented in this book that people are accepting as true. Take for example the myth of Arthur and the quest for the Grail itself. Two of the leading theories scholars hold about Arthur was that he was a Roman or that he was a British Celt. The later theory to my mind is most probable as the Celtic bards mention Arthur's quests fairly often as well as the quests of others for a \\"caldron of immortality\\" a legend which predates Christianity. When the legend came to France it was already modified many times.<br /><br />The author is no Umberto Eco and although it might be the current flavor of mind candy I believe this book will soon be forgotten.<br /><br />Recommended with reservations.though it might be the current flavor of mind candy I believe this book will soon be forgotten. <br />Recommended with reservations.	2005-04-11

It is always a treat  to read well written prose and the topics he raises are important. For that reason I give this book five stars. Although the writing is first rate I was left with the feeling of that the perspective it offers is somewhat imbalanced. It certainly is a call to arms but perhaps Friedman over reaches in this manifesto and makes conclusions that do not always follow. In my opinion the \\"flatness\\" we now perceive, a seeming equality of individuals through the Internet is an illusions. The institutions which act like filters are still present and act as filters even now on the Internet.  Through its evolution the Internet will more and more fall in line.   Globalization is a genie that the US in my opinion let out of the bottle. I do not see that it was an inevitability.   Further Friedman neglects to emphasize the sheer power the United States still wields in the world.  Are Y2K, the rise of China and the World Trade Center attack are all some of the most important events of this emerging century were these changes inevitable or where they the result of poor judgment of US foreign policy over the past 15 years? From my perspective many of these mistakes were made by our politician  most especially in the Clinton years (despite good intentions) but there has also been a cancer that has been eating away at our society for a long while most notably in education and in our intelligence community. We have overestimated our power while trying to express a largess in a world that seems to only boil over more with anti-Americanism. We have served up hope to the third world without coming through which can only make the populations of the third world more anti-American. Certainly this is not only  the fault of America as despots of the third world have made corruption into an artform and are the main impediment to alleviating world hunger. America's fault is in it's naivety.  I choose to believe we have made the messwe are in now and we can change American policies if our leaders are quick and savvy enough.   Are the aforementioned events (Y2K, 9-11, the rise of China and the Internet) even connected - in my mind not necessarily. Only time can tell us.  Certainly a dangerous convergence of events has occurred recently and we must adapt. The attack on 9-11 was a warning that is certain.  Another point I will take with issue with Friedman on is his pointing to the bursting of the dot.com bubble while saying that the Internet is making for a level playing field. There seems to me to be a contradiction somewhere in that - more than that the author will allow himself to admit.. We also have no way of know if indeed the Internet will level the playing field as it is something which is too new to make any conclusions about. That the Internet levels the playing field is a cliche.  There are certain contradictions to American culture in its embracing of  freedom and materialism. We have seen before the triumph of Democracy over Totalitarianism during W.W.II but is it always the case? On one hand a Democracy makes easier the free exchange of ideas but on the other a Totalitarian regime like China can make great changes in a hurry as it functions with one mind. Will China receive through the Internet Democracy or will the economic power recently given to the totlitarian regime make that change impossible. That is one of the great questions for the future.    One more point I would like to make and it is this: if history has shown us anything, the world never was nor ever will be, \\"flat\\". In that way the author neglects some of the great lessons of history.  Still a very stimulating and thought provoking read.	2005-04-11

The author whose picture (if we only had a picture) should be next to the word \\"paranoia\\" in the dictionary in this book documents the sixties as well introduces us to his unusual perspective. Like in many of Pychon's works fact and fiction are blurred. The heroine of the story, Oedipa Maas as executrix of the estate of her late millionaire paramour, goes on journey akin for the quest of the grail. She is searching for the truth but the truth becomes more an more obscure as her journey goes on. Populated by such unforgetable characters as Stanley Kotex and LSD therapist Dr. Hilarius the book is filled with clever puns and word play. Arcane references a peppered through out the book from both science , liturature and history some of which probably originate from Pychon's college years when he double majored at Cornell in English and Engineering. But what makes Oedipa's journey poigniant is that although Oedipa finds herself entangled in various affairs she still maintains the innocence of a child. On her journey she happens upon conspiracy on top of conspiracy such as the W.A.S.T.E. system, an illegal and underground postal system whose symbol is the horn of Tristero. Why does the Tristero horn keep cropping up? From my take it is a symbol of revolution and anarchy (since ony the federal government is authorized to deliver the mail): it is a symbol of the time the book is set in. Like Oedipa the reader finds themselves suddenly being sucked into a paranoic hyper-real state. Her journey is not only a search for truth but a search for America. It is not only a time capsule of the sixties, a time where both the sexual revulution and the height of the cold war co-existed, reading it now one finds it prophetic. In a style some might call deconstructionist the crescendo of the book, at least from my perspective comes somewhere in the middle of the story. I think though like anygreat work of art much of the meaning comes from a synergy between author and the reader as I believe no one interpretation of the work is definitive. Much like artist works in paint Pychon paints with words.	2005-04-08

Mallory is no hack, he is a noted scholar of Proto Indo European and an exceptional linguists (among his credentials he is editor of The Journal of Indo-European Studies).  In this book takes a multidisciplinary approach in his quest to find the origins of the Indo-Europeans with his main focus on the extrapolated language of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) and archeology. It is a must for anyone wishing to gain insight into the subject. Some may find parts of the book slow going while others with an intellectual ax to grind (which unfortunately often occurs in academia) or have just a modicum of knowledge of linguistics may quibble with some points Mallory makes but the book is truly beyond reproach and certainly understandable to the general reader.   His theories run counter to Colin Refrew's, while mostly in agreement with Marija Gimbutas who Mallory once studied under.  For those looking for concrete answers as to the origins of PIE coming from this book the answer is simple: neither this nor any other piece of scholarship can provide concrete answers on the subject at this time. But in my opinion this book offers the closest thing to it.   For those looking for an excellent overview of the topic or just stimulating reading I highly recommend this book.	2005-04-08

Trevor-Roper takes us from his years at Oxford and his association with famous homosexual elite of the turn of the century, his excesses in spending beyond his means, an excellent linguist, a notorious con-man, and exceptional forger, a neglected figure in history and in his old age, a latent homosexual. Homosexuality (although I mention the word twice in this review) is certainly not the prominent theme and is handled with delicacy and is merely treated as another facet in trying to understand this complex man. I recommend this book for both the historian and any reader of fiction that enjoys a good yarn. Sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction.	2005-04-07

A comprehensive work using some many recent archeological discoveries. It is a great work if somewhat pedantic and should have more footnotes than it does. Some readers may be annoyed too that some chapters use second hand sources. And like Kruta's book on the Celts some of the essays are somewhat uneven in their quality. Certain chapters focus too much on arcana while others are down right confusing. It is also uneven  in presenting scant information on the Hallstatt period. It is  not recommend for those studying Celtic art as it lacks any color photographs. It is not the type of book that one reads through in one sitting. Still it is a great reference work.	2005-04-07

This book is a must have not only for those who have an interest in classical Rome but for anyone attempting to understand current politics and the human condition. More approachable than Tacitus, Suetonius could teach a thing or two to our modern day reporters. He dispassionately describes events of classical Rome from multiple, often opposing perspectives. Far from being dry, Grave's translation of Suetonius sparkles with vitality.	2005-04-07

A great introduction. It is informative yet not dry. It is an overview but not breezy. <br />I highly recommend.	2005-04-07

A comprehensive guide chock full of valuable information. It is well illustrated although the photos are a product of their time and lack the clarity of modern day photos. It is considered the bible of moth books although since its printing many other books have since come out with better photos and more recent information in such the subfield of moth rearing.	2005-04-07

If you buy just one book on oriental rugs this should not be the one. It is overly simplistic in some area and overly detailed in others. <br />It is neither a good book on new rugs nor of antique rugs as it is quite outdated. Still if you have a collection of rug books  already and know the subject well some nuggets of information can be gleaned from this book.	2005-04-07

True the book is a large tome but it is never dull and very approachable and well illustrated.. I recommend this book for students of many disciplines including biologists, anthropologists and psychologists. It offers a unique study of the human condition from a perspective most are unfamiliar with. <br />A great contribution to science by, in my opinion, one of the greatest minds of this century.	2005-04-07

First let me say that as a rug dealer of many years and founder of the Boston Rug Society and having written numerous articles in such journals Hali and Antiquitaten Zeitung there is no way of easily pricing antique oriental rugs and in this way is quite misleading. If one wants to gain insight into the pricing of oriental rugs I recommend a subscription to Hali and Sotheby's catalogues. By all means do not use this book to price oriental rugs. The best way to begin this process if you do have an heirloom you are wondering about is to have a professional appraisal done (auction houses such as Sotheby's and Skinner's will do this free of charge). This book is skimpy in its information and the dealer recommendations at the end of the book  reads more like a list of friends of the author than a list of reputable dealers. Some of these people I know and are reputable while other on the list  I have found less so in my experience. More so than any other field I have encountered the field of oriental rugs and its dealers is full of alliances and petty feuds. Do not use this book to price oriental rugs or to pick a dealer. There is no one simple \\"open sesame\\" to the world of oriental rugs.	2005-04-07

It was one of my favorites on the subject  but it is unfortunately outdated. I wavered for that reason for a while  between giving the book five stars for my affection for the book but three stars because so many advancements in keeping marine aquariums have been made since this books was first printed. Much of the book is about Straughan and his own experiences but it is not done in a boastful way and it actually makes the book more delightful. One  should know that this was written by a resident of Florida who had access to the sea where he many times collected as opposed to many of we aquarists who are landlocked. Some of Straughan's ideas presented in this book are experimental and I would not want the beginner to be swayed by these ideas. This used to be a must have for the beginner but it is no longer.	2005-04-07

Although I would not recommend this book for the beginner it is an excellent and comprehensive work. As it is a compilation of articles by many authors I found some of the chapters uneven in their quality but this is a slight quibble. <br />The book is lavishly illustrated with quality illustrations and photographs. A good read as well as a good reference book. <br />Recommended.	2005-04-07

Although some first time readers find Pynchon impenetrable the book is well worth adjusting to the author's sometimes quirky style. The man who made paranoia a virtue, for those who have never read Pynchon before it is almost impossible to describe his writing style -surreal, pedantic, comic, absurd, deconstructionistic, poetic it is all of those things and yet those words fall far short. To read Pynchon is an experience. Despite its length readers should find Mason & Dixon enjoyable and will find themselves craving for more at the book's end. <br />Both cosmic and comic the book makes use of historical reference many of which seem unbelievable but are true (such as the duck automaton which Pynchon turns into an avenging killer),as was done in Gravity's Rainbow, add to the slightly surreal quality of Pynchon's writing in his blurring the boundaries between historical fact and fiction. <br />As Gravity's Rainbow was a modern day Iliad set in W.W.II, Mason & Dixon is set in the years of the formation of America <br />Taking on opposing ideologies which continue in America to this date (such as his tale of the  battles between Jesuits and martial arts masters) Pynchon's writing though comic is philosophical and social commentary. <br />Highly recommended.	2005-04-07

And when the author trys to present factual material many of what is presented  as fact  runs contrary to other Celtic scholars whose credentials are far more extensive. (such as the reasons for the Saxon invasions, and  when the author describes the Saxon invasion of Britain there is never again a mention of the Romans).<br /><br />  Ancient Celtic art, my humble opinion some of the most beautiful art mankind has ever created, is both barely mentioned and when it is disparaged. The Hallstatt period is barely mentioned and when it is the dates of the period are wrong! (this is both important and basic information).<br /><br />  And yet there are many \\"sins of omission\\" of factual material. There is too much time spent on myth while barely skimming the surface when it comes to archeological evidence as well as classical Mediterranean sources.<br /><br />  There is also a great amount of picking and choosing by the author such as concentrating on just several tribes and forgetting the rest.<br /><br />A great amount of arcane history is detailed in some parts whereas other significant parts of the history of the Celts are totally neglected.  The book is a mess as it jumps around from Freud to Jung to ancient Greek philosophers (even Cocteau is brought into the mix) and wastes much time on dubious philosophical musings and half baked psychological interpretations by the author.<br /><br />  It reads as both being bombastically scholarly yet smacks of New Age philosophy.<br /><br />Not recommended - especially for the beginner.	2005-04-05
