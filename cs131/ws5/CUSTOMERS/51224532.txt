Her lyrical prose creates vivid pictures (I love the image of the witch running off with her house of bones!) and the story is beautiful and wonderfully strange, bringing to mind a fairy tale by the Grimms. I was a little disappointed, however, by the lack of intensity in the story and felt that characterization was sacrificed for story development. The characters don't seem fully realized and Sidonie especially  seems like a caricature, as the beautiful, golden princess. Still, definitely worth reading for McKillip and fairy tale fans!	2003-06-18
US	51224532	RD1QAYTGJ2ML5	0505524724	402574196	Sacrament (Candleglow)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Unusual and engrossing	I'm not usually a big fan of the vampire romance genre so I almost didn't pick up this book because of its lurid bodice-ripper cover and the vampire story. Glad I didn't judge this book by its cover! This is definitely not your typical romance novel. The dark tone may turn off those who like their romances sweet or fluffy. Sacrament is subdued, yet intense and a pleasure to read--Ms. Squires resists using the overblown prose so often utilized in this genre in an attempt to convey passion and depth of character. Sarah and Julien's characters unfold as the story progresses and their developing respect and love for each other is subtle and believable--although Julien's feelings are for most of the story, far from obvious. I have to agree however, that Corina's character and actions were so over-the-top that it was a bit jarring and detracted from an otherwise excellent story. A keeper! I'll definitely be looking for more of Ms. Squires' stories.	2003-03-26

Susannah and Gaaron were pleasant, strong characters but a bit uninspired and passionless for my taste. They spent such little time together that it was difficult to believe that they'd really fallen in love. The story moved along well but did not develop as fully as I'd hoped it would, and left the relationship between the Archangel-to-be and his angelica mostly untouched. I agree, too, that the ending was quite abrupt--I would have liked to have experienced the wedding and the Gloria. There also seemed to be less music in this book, and as music is such an integral part of this series, it felt a little lacking. It would have been nice to have had Gaaron and Susannah sing together more than just the once!<br />Try Shinn's earlier books--The Shape-Changer's Wife and Archangel.	2003-03-13

Time for the story to be wrapped up, though. Elliott has created an interesting world, although her parallel story lines told from the point of views of multiple different chracters can get distracting at times and has a tendency to interrupt the flow of the novel (granted the technique was used successfully by Tolkien but here she's juggling nine or ten different, albeit intertwined, storylines). The series seems to be losing its passion, too, as it continues to unfold. The italicized shared consciousness/dream sequences are used a little too liberally for my taste--they feel too artificial. Although decent, this was not my favorite volume of the series. Alain's story has become the most interesting of the lot; Liath and Sanglant's relationship seems more perfunctory than anything now and makes less sense to me as the story progresses (although I'm still hoping they live happily ever after...); and I feel like the villains in this volume have become caricatures of evil. I will likely stick with the series until the bitter end, although I'm really hoping for resolution in the next volume, and soon (and hopefully in less than 900 pp.!)	2003-02-23

Iuti Mano is a battle-scarred warrior whose self-imposed exile/retirement is abruptly ended by the machinations of a power-hungry local sorceress and the drummers of the book's title, who covet Iuti's warrior skin for their Mother Drum. The magical Pacific Islands-inspired world of the demon drummers becomes almost tangible as you succumb to Severance's seemless storytelling. She skillfully incorporates elements of Pacific island culture into her story but manages to create a world all her own. Iuti is an awesome character--a strong yet three-dimensional protagonist that will appeal to both women and men alike (she definitely kicks ...!). I think this was my favorite of the series, although they were all wonderful. Kudos, Carol--and please give us more!	2003-02-08

Ivory continues to write beautifully crafted stories with unusual, complicated characters and believable love stories. She manages to create unique stories in a genre that thrives on formula and hackneyed story lines; the imperfections of her characters (both in body and in character--a refreshing change from overwrought femme fatales with 18-inch waists and bounteous, heaving bosoms!) make them more real and endearing to the reader. She even manages to make the developing relationship between Emma and Stuart believable, despite the signficant class/social differences. A few criticisms, however: I have to agree that Leonard was too one-sided (too greedy, too lecherous and too gullible) to be believable. It was hard to believe that anyone would fall for such a half-baked scheme--especially someone that is as bright as Leonard purportedly is--and then flee overseas when told to go. I guess I prefer my &quot;villains&quot; with some redeeming qualities. Still, overall, a very satisfying read that I was sorry to see end. I can't wait for her next effort!	2002-11-13

Merry is smart, politically savvy and has a bevy of gorgeous men at her disposal. I have to admit that I find Merry much more interesting as a character than Anita Blake; the gore is more toned down and there's more political intrigue and maneuvering than blood and guts. A few inconsistencies in the plot, as well as a lot of dropped hints that aren't followed up on, and her determinedly casual language gets a little distracting sometimes, but I found the book riveting, nonetheless. As much as I love this new series, though, I'm hoping that this doesn't become another endless series like the AB series--a little closure would be nice!	2002-10-22

The politics of the Unseelie and Seelie Courts is engrossing and the developing relationships between Meredith and her Guards--as well as Meredith's developing power and political savvy--entertaining. Steamy sex scenes (although they lose a little bit of their impact when they're used so indiscriminately).

Rois was an amazing character and makes a wonderful and magical narrator. You see the world from her not-completely-human perspective and it really comes to life. The ending is a bit confusing, though--does Corbet forget everything from the other world? Is he now fully human? Did he ever love Rois at all (or Laurel, for that matter) or was he just using them to become human and to escape the other world? Still, it is a beautiful, magical tale that I was sad to see end.	2002-08-12

I couldn't relate to or like a main character who is convinced that she's in love with and is destined to marry a dashing celebrity that she's never met (she feels that she knows him because she's read about all of his exploits in the tabloids)! It was also pretty unbelievable that Justin (who was definitely more appealing as a character) was in love with Natalie. Not her best work.	2002-08-12

McKillip's shadow world is fascinating, a recurrence of her theme of parallel worlds joined by gateways that only those that can &quot;see&quot; can access. I loved Mag's character and thought Ducon had a lot of potential, but felt that they lacked a certain emotional depth. As usual, McKillip ends the tale with more ambiguities--no simple &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending for this author! Such is life, I suppose, but in your fiction, it is nice sometimes to have closure...and I had hoped that Mag and Ducon would end up falling in love, so ended a bit disappointed.	2002-08-12

The basic plot is one of the most hackneyed, overdone plots in the romance genre, but Ms. Ross has managed to bring forth a magical, unique story that does not insult the reader's intelligence and is not formulaic in the least. My only minor complaints are that the love between the two main characters does not seem as well developed as it might have been (they have known each other only for a week, of course), that the villain is a little too unredeemable, and that the characters contain shades of Nigel and Frances's characters/speech patterns from Ms. Ewing's Illusions.

So I have to admit that I haven't been able to force myself to read this book all the way through, despite trying several times. I found the heroine very selfish and manipulative, rather than innocent and cute, as I'm sure she's meant to be. She takes advantage of an injured man, telling lie after lie, binding him to her and trying to shape his personality to her own desires, not once thinking of him as an individual with his own life or loved ones to return to. And then when things go awry and he demands that she become either his mistress or his wife, she has the gall to say that HE tricked HER and that he is not giving her a choice. Ironic, hmm? Definitely not a story line that sits well with me.	2002-05-23

And the hero's character--although sexy, was also a big stretch of the imagination--a medical wunderkind (MD/PhD by the age of 20, no less) who just happened to pick up combat and undercover skills long the way (like using Uzis, flying helicopters and carrying out assassination attempts). And like he's got the clout to send &quot;his team&quot; to just hang out and make sure nothing happens to her in a bar while waiting for an assignation with him.

Unfortunately, this one simply did not live up to expectations. I found the efforts to tie this book in with the last distracting and forced; Claire and Adrian never become fully realized characters and honestly were rather boring; Nigel and Sir Reginald were caricatures and it was difficult to care what happened to any of them. I found myself stuggling to slog through to the end (actually, I haven't been able to bring myself to finish it yet). Chase is at her best when she portrays strong, dark characters and when there's a bit more of a spark between her lovers (not to mention more tension or love scenes!).	2001-12-05

Another wonderful book from JMR, in her vintage tongue-in-cheek style and her wicked sense of humor. It took me two readings to fully appreciate her style--this book was my very first  introduction to her, months ago when I was in the mood for something with a  bit less substance and more flash. Three books later, I came back to this  one--and it was definitely well worth the second trip! Margaret is such a  great character--full of common sense and insight that Riley uses to gently  poke fun at the absurdities of society. It's refreshing to see a woman who  is extraordinary by virtue of the strength of her character rather than her  looks, and one made even more appealing by her various quirks. And, as  always, it's nice to see the woman rescuing the man, although I was  initially hard-pressed to see what she saw in the self-important,  self-pitying Gregory (although he DOES improve in the end!). I HAVE in vain  been trying to locate the prequel--maybe it'll enlighten me. Can't really  comment on the audio, though, since I read this in the book version.	2000-05-04
