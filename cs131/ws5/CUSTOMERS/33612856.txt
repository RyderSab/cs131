It has to be such, because this long book is full of so much intimate detail.   <br /> <br />Oh, of course, Augie March's adventures are not all true, not all of them.  It's fictionalized for effect, but it's just truer in some respects than many novels.  Maybe that also explains why it seems to drag and get boring so often.   <br /> <br />Knowing nothing of Saul Bellow's life, I can't really say how much Saul and Augie resemble each other, but I'm sure there's a knowledgeable English professor out there somewhere who has studied and written about Bellow, his life, his works, and their interweaving.   <br /> <br />Those who can't do, teach, or maybe they write.  Augie admits that he can't do much, so he writes to fill up the empty space in his life.  <br /> <br />Augie narrates the entire story in the first person, just as an autobiographer does.  However, Augie is not an \\"important\\" personage, at least not in the public's eye, so his story is \\"fiction,\\" so to speak. <br /> <br />However, it is interesting.  This is my first reading of Bellow.  I know he became highly respected as he continued to write, and I do intend to read more of his oeuvre. <br /> <br />He's verbose and a little confusing at times, but nevertheless, he's interesting, him and Augie both, Augie being his alter ego. <br /> <br />Augie March is the second son in a small and relatively poor family.  His father has disappeared.  His mother is passive and a surrogate grandmother moves in to rule the young household.  This all takes place on Chicago's South Side toward the end of the 1930's, and we then follow Augie through the end of the Second World War, when he ends up in Paris helping to run some kind of black market operation on surplus Army supplies. <br /> <br />Augie's brother, Simon, marries into a family with money and then makes his own fortune.  In the book's last chapter, we get the denouement of Simon's life story, an ill-fated tryst with a paramour who then tries to sue him.   <br /> <br />Augie, meanwhile, meanders here and there, in a seemingly aimless path, keeping a journal because of all the free time he has, so he tells us. <br /> <br />He takes up with various women, rich and poor, does some petty crime with an old homeboy, and reads constantly, whenever he can, educating himself.   <br /> <br />He breaks a bone falling off a horse while training an eagle in Mexico with his girlfriend, so the military will not accept him, and instead, he joins the Merchant Marines.  His boat is blown to bits and he finds himself, along with the ship's carpenter, as the lone two survivors, as far as they know.  This part is hard to believe, among other parts, but who cares?  It's real enough. <br /> <br />All through his narration, Augie gives us various philosophical tidbits to think about, for example, when he and his boat mate, the ship's carpenter who has a degree in biophysics or some such are discussing why humans get bored and amoebas don't.  A question I often ask myself, sort of. <br /> <br />Or Augie writes: \\"People don't do what they have a talent for but what the preoccupation leads to...(for example) If they're good at auto-repairing they have to sing Don Giovanni...It's having to prove full and ultimate self-sufficiency or some such monster dream that you don't need anyone else to do these things for you.\\"   <br /> <br />This little bit of Augie's philosophy really hit home with me, and it described my feelings \\"to a tee\\" (so to speak).   <br /> <br />Augie's romantic experiences never quite spill over into the profane or pornographic, but they get close.  He travels to a small town outside of Mexico City (Acatla) to be with one sweetheart, a rich and eccentric young woman who finally jilts him, though he was first untrue to her. <br /> <br />There are too many other characters in Augie's narration to even keep track of.  I started highlighting people's names, to help me remember them, because they keep recurring, just as people come and go in each of our lives.  Nevertheless, it did not help: I still could not keep everyone straight in Augie's long story. <br /> <br />Augie's brother, Simon, stands out, and his mentor, Einhorn, the crippled man who still manages to make it the best way he can.  The Mexican, Padilla, is an interesting character, an apparent mathematical genius, and with a good heart.   <br /> <br />Augie's women are not very appealing.  His mother is kindly but seemingly lost due in part to loss of vision as she aged.  Grandma Lausch is too much of an autocrat, small kingdom or no. <br /> <br />Augie's Greek girlfriend, Sofie, seems good-hearted and she certainly was not a prude.   <br /> <br />Stella, a minor actress whom he ends up marrying after meeting her in Mexico, is pleasant, up to a point, but later Augie learns about her \\"sugar daddy\\" and a little habit Stella has of not telling the truth.   <br /> <br />Anyway, the crux of the matter is that, if you like long and involved novels, that go nowhere and everywhere at the same time, this is your book.   <br /> <br />It's nothing like the quick and dirty novels that cloy the best-seller lists today, but it should hold up over time, especially for the unique perspective of Augie March, aka Saul Bellow, growing up in the Chicago of that era.   <br /> <br />In that geographic respect, Augie/Saul share Chicago with Nelson Algren, although he was a little bit later in sequence, and with Nelson's friend, Studs Terkel, the \\"working\\" person's writer. <br /> <br />Diximus. <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />  <br />	2005-09-28

Lisa's father is not a factor in her life, whoever he was.  Instead, Lisa's mother has taken up with another man, a fellow named Dan, for whom she is ready to do just about anything, just to keep him around.  Of course, Lisa resents this and feels rejected, but at least her grandmother seems to maintain some of the \\"old school\\" wisdom about how to survive in the world as a single mother. <br /> <br />So that is what Lisa finally resolves to do, at the end of the book, to survive as a single mother and give her own daughter as much as she can.  It appears, at this final part of the story, that Lisa will make a change and break the cycle of female dependence on unreliable males. <br /> <br />Yet, readers will never know for sure what happens, unless Ms. Chick decides to write a follow-up book, a sequel, continuing the story of Lisa and Alex, her daughter, and the others of the small circle of friends and relatives in the London of today. <br /> <br />Diximus. <br />	2005-09-18

I recognized only a few names, such as Russell Baker and David Halberstam, but then I never did read the New York Times.  The Los Angeles Times has always been my paper, since I have always lived in Los Angeles. <br /> <br />What I learned, for one thing, is how difficult it must have been for reporters in those days to get their stories out by teletype machines or simply by telephone, since that was the peak of existing technology at that time.  Oh what changes the Internet has wrought! <br /> <br />Read this book and see how news reporting must have changed.  Learn about reporting in the South during the Civil Rights era.  Learn about reporting from Communist and paranoid Russia and its satellites; about a supposedly Jewish fellow who claimed to belong to the KKK; about reporting from Africa, almost impossible in those days, unless you were willing to sit by the teletyper for hours on end. <br /> <br />Learn about the mad scramble at the Times plant when the power went out in New York City.  They still got their paper out, and the process is interesting. <br /> <br />Well, as noted, being from Los Angeles, I'm not really as big a New York Times fan as Ruth Adler, but the book did teach me much about those times and about journalism as a profession, one to which I at one time aspired.  I can see now, it's a more difficult profession, especially reporting from overseas, than I had suspected. <br /> <br />Diximus.	2005-09-14

So what else is new? <br /> <br />I feel sorry for Gary Allen.  He wrote a whole little book about this vast conspiracy of rich people, back in 1971.  The Council on Foreign Relations was the main gathering place for these nefarious people. <br /> <br />What Mr. Allen seemed to miss is that rich people have always had the power to run the world, and probably always will.  The culprit in this scenario is not rich people per se, but the system itself. <br /> <br />Mr. Allen seems to be a supporter of capitalism, free enterprise, and what it has produced in the world.  Well, guess what?  If there was a conspiracy then, it's probably still going on now, but who cares, really? <br /> <br />You going to bang your head against the wall ranting against the rich?  I'm not: I'm going to give in, if that's what they want.  You know what else?  So did Christ.  He gave in to the \\"powers that be\\" and that was his example to us.  His kingdom is not of this world. <br /> <br />That's why I feel sorry for Mr. Allen.  He's so wrapped up in this world he can't see the forest for the trees.  That's why his book is seldom read anymore, if it ever was. <br /> <br />Another mistake he makes: Rich people do die, just like the rest of us.  You don't think that at least some of them finally decide to stop conspiring against the world?  I do.  They may be rich, but a small fraction still has a conscience, maybe more, who knows?  I don't know any rich people myself.  I'm not living in poverty, so I guess I've been \\"bought off\\" by the conspirators.   <br /> <br />Aside from all that, it does have some interesting points, about the Federal Reserve and about the Council on Foreign Relations, both of which still proceed as usual, never mind Allen's book.  <br /> <br />Gary Allen touts the John Birch Society.  And if you vilify that group, well you're just giving in to the conspirators, aren't you?   <br /> <br />If you like conspiracies, widespread ones, you'll get a kick out of this book.  I think it's destined for the junk pile of lost causes.  Diximus. <br />	2005-08-01

It did do that, but otherwise, it the book was estupido! <br /> <br />This young woman, of Norman descent (the book takes place in England, close to London, and that's about all the local color we get, another big deficiency to me), with the colorful name of India Marchand, is impressed by a dashing young businessperson named Aidan (not Quinn, but whatever happened to him and his acting career?). <br /> <br />She makes a bet with a girlfriend that she can snag him, and it looks like she'll collect until he walks off at the marriage ceremony, just before tying the knot. <br /> <br />What went wrong?  Well, you will read the rest of the book asking this question, and at the very end, you will find out.  As a child, this so-called \\"lone wolf\\" watched his parents frequently fight (they later died together in a car accident), and therefore he grew up with a very negative idea about marriage.   <br /> <br />Guess what!  It didn't dawn on him until he was two minutes from saying \\"I do\\" that he shouldn't repeat the mistake of his parents. <br /> <br />Now you tell me: Is this man likely to make a good and faithful husband?  Well, you know romances, always a happy conclusion.  That is exactly where we end: India and Aidan now understand each other and they also understand just why he failed to follow through the first time.  They're going to give it another go, now that they \\"truly\\" love and understand each other. <br /> <br />Will they make it?  Hey, you can't give up your dreams!  When you give up your dreams, you die, so they say.  Forget about reality, and truth.  That's why the romance genre is so popular, I think.  It's the adult reader's version of a fairy tale, isn't it? <br /> <br />The only thing I learned from this little romance is that the Norman descendants in England still consider themselves distinct as an ethnic population.  Of course intermarriage with the Anglo-Saxon stock, if that is what Aidan is, is no big thing.  It is not like interethnic marriage here in the U.S.  That was somewhat interesting.

Morgan, Henry Ford, and others.  Doctorow has made it easy to take this historical medicine, by deftly threading their stories with the plot of the book.  <br /> <br />That plot has to do essentially with \\"the boy\\" and his family, including his future stepfather and his daughter.  The action of the plot, and its stirring climax, however, are due almost entirely to the life and death of one Coalhouse Walker II, a one-time musician turned \\"terrorist,\\" because he couldn't stomach the racism around New Rochelle, New York. <br /> <br />Coalhouse, whose fancy car is trashed by some racist thugs operating as quasi-public servants, gathers a few young blacks to travel with him, along with \\"the boy's\\" uncle (\\"Younger Brother\\"), and together they blow up some of New Rochelle's fire stations, kill some of the inhabitants, and then take J.P. Morgan's luxurious library hostage (by accident). <br /> <br />Younger Brother is a munitions and dynamite expert, having learned in his older brother's factory, and when it is all over and Coalhouse turns himself in to be murdered himself, Younger Brother supposedly heads off to Mexico to fight in the Revolution there, until he blows himself up.  Interesting fellow.  Among many you will find in this book. <br /> <br />The flavor of how it must have been back then comes through loud and clear, but you know what?

The book was published over ten years ago, and it seems to have dropped through the cracks of the large and populous human growth floorboards, of which it was a part.    The first thing I noticed about Bradshaw's writing is its sheer verbosity.  He writes in a roundabout way, rather than concisely and to the point.  Contrast him, for example, with a writer on Buddhism or Taoism (say, Alan Watts?).      Writing on Buddhism or Taoism may provide authors with a natural impetus to be concise, but the human growth movement is broad and billowy, and concise writing may not be important to the authors.      And Bradshaw seems to drag in every alley cat he ever heard meow in the human growth movement, to help him reflect on what he sees as the underlying principle of it all: Shame.    Bradshaw reports that he is a theologian, but also someone who recovered from alcoholism, and was deeply shamed as a child, which shame he finally learned to deal with and overcome.      There are many fine snippets from his book, which may be of use to folks, but overall, I think most people looking for direction are going to be repelled by his constant conceptualizations.  To paraphrase another well-known quotation, \\"People cannot live on concepts alone.\\"    If he had given more personal studies or little case histories, it would have been much more helpful.  Instead, he includes page after page of some \\"guided\\" meditations or shame inquiries, which were totally useless to me.  If you are looking for guided meditations, this is the place for you.      So, in all, Bradshaw's book does not hold up to scrutiny after time, in my opinion.  It's one of the many from its era and niche that was forgotten and will be unlikely to remembered henceforth.  Anyway, it was a bestseller once, and that's what counts, I guess.  It did have its 15 minutes of fame, and a lot of books never even get that.  Diximus.	2005-07-20

Well, 1990 has come and gone, and Dr. Ravi Batra is not that good of a prognosticator.  However, he is a radical dude, and you have to like him for that, unless, of course, you are not radical. <br /> <br />I am (a radical, I mean). <br /> <br />You have to get to the end of this book to really understand what Batra's agenda is.  The last few chapters are still relevant to today's American economy and society.  It is a picture of pure and unadulterated classicism.  Whoops, did I say that?  Hey, I'm in the middle class.  Isn't everybody? <br /> <br />Batra blames all economic problems, today and yesterday, on wealth concentration.  I believe this is what might be called a \\"populist\\" viewpoint, because it paints \\"the people\\" against the rich elites.   <br /> <br />Yet, it is only a viewpoint.  Batra does not actually prove his point; he only shows some possible correlations between economic dips and wealth concentration.   <br /> <br />You have to appreciate him, though.  Batra has a tough gig, drawing conclusions about an entire national economy.  The years since 1990 prove that Batra did not and probably could not factor in all the possible variables, for example, the emergence of conflict between the U.S. and radical Islam. <br /> <br />This excerpt shows you how radical Batra was when he wrote this book: \\"Time and again throughout history, enormous concentration of wealth among the few has drive the poverty-ridden masses to rise up and dethrone the affluent...in a massive revolution.\\" <br /> <br />Is anybody out there so poverty-stricken that he or she is ready to revolt?   <br /> <br />Revolution was more likely in the 1960s than today, and you see how those poor fools (e.g., the so-called Symbionese Liberation Army or the Weather Underground), were squashed by the almighty \\"powers that be.\\" <br /> <br />You go, Ravi!  Ravi Batra for President!  Did you like Reagan as a President?  You will not after reading this book.  I never did, anyway.   <br /> <br />Batra is a person of heart, and that's what distinguishes him from all the so-called fool Keynesians, neo-Keynesians, \\"tricklists\\" like Reagan and all their greedy, money-worshipping brethren.   <br /> <br />Batra tells it truthfully: the U.S. is now and always has been based on a culture of acquisitiveness, which boils down to greed, which boils down to \\"me first.\\"  This brings back memories of good old Ayn Rand (\\"The Virtue of Selfishness\\") and other such. <br /> <br />This book is worth its weight in all the economic policies of all those trickle downers, namely, Reagan, Bush, Bush, and so forth.  These big people support the ethic of greed, just as Batra so adeptly shows in this book.  So did the Democrats.  They cannot help it.  We cannot either, I guess.  We're like fish that don't know the water their swimming in.   <br /> <br />Yet, some advice for the author may be in order:   <br /> <br />Watch your back, dude, because Big Brother is definitely back there looking at you!  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-08

The author, Denis Woychuk, is honest about his own feelings, and he has a pretty unique story to tell. <br /> <br />Attorneys for mentally ill people, people who have also been charged with a crime, are different from other attorneys in that they work for the public sector, rather than the private sector.   <br /> <br />Woychuk is employed by the State of New York, to advocate for patients in the psychiatric wards holding people suspected of a crime, usually serious, but not always. <br /> <br />Woychuk confesses that he cannot actually always believe that his clients should be released.  Yet, he has to advocate for them, that is his precise job, that's why the State has employed him.   <br /> <br />He tells an interesting story about interviewing for a District Attorney job, early in his career.  One of the interviewers, a D.A. herself, asked him if he would ever have doubts in litigating a suspected criminal.  Woychuk told her he would have, that it was only human to occasionally have doubts about the actual guilt of the accused individual.  The D.A. said no, she never had such doubts, and intimated that he would therefore not be a real good District Attorney.  He didn't get that job.   <br /> <br />I don't know any D.A.'s personally, here in California or in New York or elsewhere, but it does seem like they would have to take a hard line toward justice.  They cannot admit doubts, or they would always be doubting.  Like Descartes?  Or Thomas? <br /> <br />This would also seem to say something about our system of \\"justice.\\"  Even D.A.'s are human, but apparently, the best ones prefer to act more like robots, because, quite simply, it's functional for them in their career niches.  Wishy-washy law enforcement people just don't make the system look good.   <br /> <br />But is there a happy medium?   <br /> <br />Woychuk intimates that he has tried to find that happy medium in his own career. <br /> <br />Anyway, Woychuk doubts, but he still does his best.  He literally hates at least one of his clients, a fellow who was abused as a child and then starts acting funny in adulthood, whispering to a teenage boy.   <br /> <br />The fellow, Woychuk calls him Derrick Diesel (most of the names are changed \\"to protect the innocent\\") is released from the psychiatric hospital, with Woychuk's strategic help, after the boy commits suicide.  Then Diesel goes on to hurt other people, and Woychuk quite naturally feels a sense of profound guilt, since he was part of the reason, maybe the entire reason, Diesel made it back to the street. <br /> <br />Well, you can see how Woychuk's story, all entirely true (we can safely assume), can really make you think, like, \\"What would I do in such a situation?\\"  I don't know if I could handle such a job.  Could you?  Well, we're not all called to be \\"attorneys for the damned.\\"   <br /> <br />I guess few people will read this book.  It's only in hardback, of course, and it is somewhat localized, since all the events occur in New York.  Still, the feelings and the problems are national and even worldwide.  I recommend this book as a teaching tool and a stimulus for self-examination. <br /> <br />Diximus.   <br />	2005-07-01

Hall. <br /> <br />What is emphasized is that most of these gangs subsisted by selling drugs, not too too surprising, since their predecessors, the Italian Mafia, for example, grew rich during Prohibition selling booze. <br /> <br />Chapter 2 covers \\"Prison Gangs.\\"  These include the Aryan Brotherhood, the Mexican Mafia, La Nuestra Familia, and others.      <br /> <br />Chapter 3 is entitled, \\"Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs.\\"  According to the authors, \\"'Outlaw' motorcycle gangs\\" started attracting attention when \\"Marlon Brando...roared across the screen of movie theaters,\\" in The Wild One.  The main group in this category, of course, is the \\"Hell's Angels,\\" those of Hunter Thompson fame (see his book on the Hell's Angels, written after he rode with a bunch for an extended period). <br /> <br />The authors write, \\"Women who ride with bikers are nothing more than slaves.....But oddly enough, there is never a shortage of volunteers.\\"  Slavery, anyone? <br /> <br />Chapter 4 is entitled, \\"The Jamaican Invasion,\\" and covers the Jamaican Posses.  The Posses deal drugs, too, but they have their own territories, distinct from the other gangs, that is, covering the Caribbean. <br /> <br />Chapter 5 is entitled, \\"The Colombian Connection,\\" covering the drug cartels which supply mostly cocaine.   <br /> <br />Chapter 6 is entitled, \\"The New Yakuza,\\" covering Japanese gangsters.   <br /> <br />Chapter 7 covers \\"The Cuban Mafia,\\" which, according to Rolfe and Greeson, emanated from the work of Lucky Luciano and Santos Trafficante, who used Cuba as a heroin-smuggling hub in 1947. <br /> <br />The final chapters cover Chinese gangs and a short discussion of gangs in Chicago.   <br /> <br />There is a nice index, but no reference list. <br /> <br />The authors have gathered a lot of useful information which needs to be updated, periodically, probably.  The paperback version is \\"perfect\\" bound, and the pages are likely to fall out for that reason, as they did on the copy I have.   <br /> <br />What the essence of the whole book seems to say is that crime is alive and well in the United States, indeed, in the whole Western Hemisphere.  If you mix male aggressiveness and the culturally approved need to achieve, together with the opportunity to make money in a \\"protected\\" market (which is precisely what a \\"black market\\" really is), then that's essentially what you get, a lot of \\"crime.\\"   <br /> <br />Diximus.    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-23

I call him a loser.<br /><br />Oh, I can identify with him, all right.  He wants to take the \\"geographic cure,\\" move far, far away from his problems, just like an alcoholic or addict.  According to A.A., the geographic cure doesn't work.  But Patrick does give it a good shot.<br /><br />What's implausible, and reprehensible, is that he would use an old man's body (the man was already dead), to fake his own death, thus to make a \\"clean\\" getaway.  He even attends his own funeral.<br /><br />Even though the old man was dead, Patrick showed how selfish he is (was?) by even using the corpse so he can further his own purposes.  I was glad when Eva, his Brazilian paramour (or so we believe) stood him up.  The man is a loser, but the only way he can turn it around is to learn to live on his own, depending only on himself, not on the millions that he lost, not on anyone else, just his own head.<br /><br />I don't think Grisham's Patrick Lanigan, aka Danilo, can actually do that.<br /><br />Aside from that, the other characters in this book are all very interesting, and the Coast, the Gulf Coast he means, is a very interesting area, made so by Grisham's sharp prose.<br /><br />Grisham also sets some of the book in Brazil and in parts of Europe, Washington, New York, Miami, and other cities.  All of this is intriguing, and believable.  This book held me in a grip and I finished it in three days.<br /><br />Patrick, however, is not believable.  No one could be that smart and that much of an emotional loser.  Or is truth stranger than fiction?<br />	2005-06-16
US	33612856	R1PXJI1JECIW5F	044023722X	299088859	A Painted House	Books	5	0	2	N	N	Popular Sociology	This is a very interesting book, although I can understand how some people would find it boring, \\"like watching paint dry.\\" <br /> <br />In this book, John Grisham is teaching us about life on a cotton farm in northeastern Arkansas in 1952.  I, for one, was impressed by how realistic the experience was.  I felt like virtually \\"being there,\\" farming cotton with the Chandlers. <br /> <br />Grisham takes us through the weeks, the seasons, the rains, the picking of cotton itself, the meals on the farm, the family garden, the small town (Black Oak) visits every weekend.  It's all very real and very absorbing, if, that is, you can stand living with these provincial rubes for a few months. <br /> <br />The Chandlers and their neighbors are all of \\"Anglo-Irish\\" stock, and they use \\"hill people\\" and \\"Mexicans\\" to help them pick their cotton.  The hill people are from the nearby Ozarks.  They are basically migrant workers who travel a relatively short distance to find work. <br /> <br />The Mexicans, on the other hand, come a long distance, packed into the back of a trailer, pretty much as they still do today. <br /> <br />Life on the cotton farm is dependent upon the weather, as it is, I assume, in any agriculture pursuit.  Grisham artfully depicts this dependent relationship.  His narrator, a 7-year old named Luke Chandler, keeps us constantly apprised of his Pappy's single-mindedness: everything relates to Pappy's cotton, and Pappy's cotton depends, in turn, on the weather.  Pappy is Luke's grandfather. <br /> <br />Luke's father, on the other hand, is almost a shadow figure behind his own father, but in the end he and his wife and child leave the farm to pursue a new life in Flint, Michigan, building cars for $3 per hour, a nice wage in those days. <br /> <br />This is what impressed me: Grisham's ability to have us learn about farm life in this way.  Farm life may also mean poverty, and altruism.  Luke's paternal grandmother, \\"Gran,\\" makes sure the Mexican migrant workers have a clean place to sleep and plenty of fresh vegetables.  When a neighboring family, the poor Lashers, gets flooded literally out of house and home, Gran insists on putting them up.  Pappy is like, \\"Well, how is this helping me and my farm?\\"  But he concedes to his wife. <br /> <br />There is a little drama in the book, but if you're looking for drama, you'll probably be disappointed.  There are a couple of murders and an illegitimate pregnancy.  But the drama of the book serves only as the background for the dull, plodding life of the cotton farmer, not the other way around.  In this sense, Grisham has written a daring book, and it looks like, judging from his readers, that he has pulled it off. <br /> <br />Diximus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />    <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-10

She is an only child who lives with her parents, toward whom she shows about an inch of love, if that. <br /> <br />Well, you can't blame her.  She was raped at the age of 13, after she got drunk at a house party.  No wonder she seems so negative about everything. <br /> <br />This book goes fast.  There's lots of dialogue and many lines where Melinda simply indicates that she says nothing, by putting \\"Me:\\" followed by blank space.  Easy reading for high school students.   <br /> <br />It was funny, but so true, about the class systems that develop in high school.  They reflect the classes in the world at large.  Melinda speaks from the heart about her boredom with certain courses, certain teachers, and \\"Principal Principal.\\" <br /> <br />The author, Anderson, puts forth the idea that Melinda is maladjusted because she was raped.  It was a tragedy that she was raped, but she seems to be otherwise better adjusted than many of the other students.  She has adapted, basically by being quiet and not saying anything, thus the title, \\"Speak.\\"  She finally wants to open up, to her art teacher, at the end of the book. <br /> <br />This book supports the notion that high school should not be forced on young people.  Puberty rites occur when a child reaches age 12, and that's when they used to become adults.  Not anymore.  People in high school are treated like babies, and most of them respond in kind. <br /> <br />This dynamic is quite evident at Merriweather High School, the Blue Devils, or Hornets, or..........? <br /> <br />Being pushed around, not only by Andy the Beast, her attacker, but also by her peers and her parents, poor Melinda has to retreat into a fantasy world, in a janitor's closet at the school.  Melinda is an adult, not because she was raped, but because she's old enough to make her own decisions.  But do we let her?  Heck, no!  Kids are kids until they're 21, anymore, and even then it's questionable sometimes. <br /> <br />No wonder public high schools are so messed up.  This book will help you to see that.  I was a school teacher once, and this book describes most of the reasons I disliked the job intensely.  Teachers, for the most part, are simply surrogate parents.  Thank goodness for those few rebels, like Melinda's art teacher, Mr. Freeman, who can go against the tide and actually let young people be the decision-makers they can be. <br /> <br />Diximus.	2005-05-31

It was entertaining, to a certain extent.  It was certainly well read. <br /> <br />Hal Bonner was almost like a robot, at least that's how he was read in the audiobook, talks like a robot, doesn't understand common idioms, and of course doesn't really know what love is or could be, not even sex, actually.  That's possibly understandable, in the perspective of his foster-home-in-the-mortuary upbringing, but believable?  Too far-fetched.  But, hey, it's a novel, right?  It's not supposed to be non-fiction. <br /> <br />Okay, so Helen's ex-husband (and Randall's father) has murdered his in-laws, and no one knows about it, except Randall, for how many years?  And then the inept fool is caught in an obvious trap, confessing to his wired son in the Miami airport.  Believable?  No, it's too contrived, but hey, it's a novel, right? <br /> <br />The Senator pushing the FBI around?  Well, that part is believable, I guess, I'll trust Mr. Hall on that one. <br /> <br />Misty Fielding?  No, I don't believe a young woman, no matter how bitter, would kidnap and kill a little boy.  And the business about doctoring the videotape using a 12-year old hacker, well, that's far-fetched, contrived, it doesn't fit nicely as a plot device should fit, if the author is a real master. <br /> <br />The only character I liked in this mess is Frank Sheffield, the FBI agent son of a heroic FBI agent, who appears to lack ambition and live in a sort of Taoist funk, which is precisely opposed to our idea of an FBI agent.  Of course, he comes out on top in the end, just as Lao Tse said he would. <br /> <br />Diximus. <br /> <br />	2005-05-25

Tara Persaud is described as a prophetess on the back cover of this book.  She is also a Christian from Toronto, Canada, who was \\"called\\" to pray at the O.J. Simpson trial. <br /> <br />This book is a collaboration between her and her Los Angeles contact, Rev. Lewis Smith of the Crenshaw church in Los Angeles.  Ms. Persaud is also now a member of this church. <br /> <br />Unfortunately for her readers, Ms. Persaud, and Rev. Smith have written a mostly dull book.  The only interesting parts are when they write exclusively about the trial itself, leaving out what God has told Tara Persaud to do. <br /> <br />Basically, God keeps telling Tara to fly again and again from Toronto to Los Angeles to attend the trial.  Other than that, there really isn't much of a mystical nature in this book.  There's no parting of waters, turning water into wine, or anything closely related.  Tara did say that one day, when a rumor was going around of trouble outside the Courthouse, she stood up and more or less chastised the crowd, and, guess what?  They fell back across the street.  Is that God working? <br />  <br />The only real mystery about the \\"mystery woman\\" referenced in the title of this book is, \\"Why did she write this book?\\" <br /> <br />Was she trying to piggy-back like so many others on an event that captured the lurid interest of people all over the world?  And, if so, to what end?   <br /> <br />Well, clearly, Persaud had an ethical and moral purpose, that is, she wanted us to see how powerful God is that He, She, or It can even affect current events. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the book leaves just the opposite impression: Although God may have told Tara to go pray for those involved in the trial, it had very little affect on anything that happened. <br /> <br />But she did get a chance to get of out Toronto (brrrrr!) several times to come to a mild climate.  Then she became a published author.  God did work on her behalf, after all.  Diximus.	2005-05-20

This is an intriguing book, a first person account by Mary, and it can be read almost as a morality tale: the tale of three sisters and the monster (Motown).    The three singers all had roots in the same Detroit neighborhood, and were taken on by Berry Gordy's newly formed Motown.  According to Mary, Diana seemed to always want to stand out from the other two, and of course, she eventually got her wish.  Diana comes through as an egotistical, self-serving person, who, of course, had the talent to back up her swelled head.    On the other side of the trio, Florence Ballard is the tragic heroine.  According to Mary, although the three started as peers, Flo eventually got exasperated having to fight both Diane and her paramour, Berry Gordy.  She turned to alcohol, which depressed her further, and she ended in poverty and an early death.    Mary paints herself as the peacemaker and person in the middle.  She stands by Flo in her darkest hour, but never follows her path in leaving the group.      Mary had various lovers, and she had so many, from Tom Jones to Steve McQueen to some people I'm sure nobody has ever heard of.  Mary, in her honesty, has listed most of them in this book.  After all those celebrities, she ends up, by the end of the book, marrying someone I had never heard of (he could be well-known).    Yes, I grew up listening to the Supremes, and I danced to their songs and I popped my fingers to their steady tempos like everyone else in those days.      Today, their music makes me sick, but hey, times have changed.      I think Mary has shown, in this book, that she can adapt and change, whereas Flo could not.  Flo had talent, but she maybe didn't have the type of personality to keep coping year after year in the face of quick fame followed by quick decline.      As for Diana, well, no matter how talented shewas, wouldn't it be nice if she could be just a little humble?  No?      \\"Blessed are the humble in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.\\"      Okay, nobody wants to go to Heaven (until they die, of course), but everybody wants to be \\"important\\" while still here on Earth.      Diane got her wish, she was, and to a lesser extent, she still is, \\"important.\\"      But Mary wrote the book.  Diximus.	2005-05-18

Martinez doesn't make it across. <br /> <br />Then he goes to Viet Nam, where he narrowly escapes death.  He returns to the Bay Area, finishes law school, and becomes an attorney.   <br /> <br />He marries young, but not happily, and divorces right away.  He marries a second time, to his beautiful secretary, but after giving birth to a boy, she changes her mind, leaving him with the child. <br /> <br />Gregory's two children are both wayward, but his daughter more so: she turns into a teenage hooker and drug addict.   <br /> <br />Gregory makes a pile of money but always seems to be in debt, because of his costly tastes and his support payments to the ex-wives and children.   <br /> <br />Finally, toward the end of the book, he is sued for malpractice and loses.  He has no malpractice insurance and it looks like he has \\"hit bottom.\\"  But instead of giving up, he keeps on trying, by more or less resigning from the rat race.  His friends lend or give him money to get back up, and he continues, we assume, practicing law but in a more relaxed atmosphere. <br /> <br />There are a great many interesting subsidiary characters in this book, but the next most prominent to Gregory Reeves is probably Carmen Morales, aka Tamar, Gregory's childhood girlfriend from East Los Angeles.   <br /> <br />Her story more or less interweaves with Gregory's throughout the book, although Gregory is the only character to speak in the first person, from time to time.  We find out on the final page of the book that Gregory is dictating his story to someone. <br /> <br />So what is the Infinite Plan after all?  Well, the idea emanated with Gregory's father, who seems to have made it up himselfor maybe had a revelation, and it has to do with an Afterlife, and living on earth in accord with the Afterlife, the Infinite Plan encompassing both.   <br /> <br />I don't know that there was really an Infinite Plan in the way these people weave in and out of each other's lives, but that's probably Sra. Allende's point: there is no Plan. <br /> <br />I had the pleasure of reading this book in Spanish, although some of the vocabulary did escape me.  It was to Sra. Allende's Infinite Credit that her Spanish is so clear that someone like me, just a learner, could understand most of it and get the gist of the story. <br /> <br />This is one of Allende's only books that take place in the United States, and it really is amazing how she learned everything that was going on during the 1960s and 1970s around Los Angeles and Berkeley and San Francisco, as well as Viet Nam.  Either she is a very experienced person or she had some good informants.  I am limited in knowing little of her biography, but I intend to learn more. <br /> <br />The only thing that some readers may not enjoy about Allende's style is that she tends to write with lengthy and involved paragraphs, with very little conversation.  If you're used to James Patterson or some of the other American writers who give us short little chapters with lots of dialogue, you may find Allende's writing too heavy.   <br /> <br />But it's worth the effort.  I recommend it.  Diximus. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-17

The reader was generally good but his Spanish was really sorry (sorry!).  There appeared to be at least one mis-translation from Spanish to English, but this is not the reader's fault, of course. <br /> <br />That aside, the plot line is pretty interesting, but it was reminiscent, to me at least, of Terry Southern's \\"Candy.\\"  This poor woman, a mere teenager when she first gets \\"turned out,\\" ends up in a Mexican prison, goes from there to a \\"high-class\\" Brazilian brothel, where at least one of the so-called \\"gentlemen\\" gets turned on by defecating on the young lady's face. <br /> <br />Is that we they call \\"anal eroticism\\"?  Or just sexual perversion?   <br /> <br />Before all is said and done, according to the story, she's made carnal acquaintance with about 6,000 men (and had her uterus scraped in the process, leaving her barren). <br /> <br />Would a woman like this be capable of murder?  It sure seems like it, as the story proceeds.  In fact, she admits to murder, but in another country, and with just cause. <br /> <br />And another question, would any man, even a cop like Hal Willis, consider attempting to bond with this woman on a monogamous basis?   <br /> <br />Well, these are the interesting, and sometimes titillating, questions that unfold in this little mystery. <br /> <br />This is the first McBain book I've read, and I understand that McBain is a pen name for Evan Hunter?   <br /> <br />He's a craftsman, but this book may not become a classic, and, as I said, McBain seems to be recycling some of the plot lines, about the young and beautiful woman taken advantage of by countless men, who fights back (Thelma and Louise?  How about Lorena Bobbitt?).  She has her revenge, in a sense. <br /> <br />Nor does McBain endeavor to be a classic writer or particularly creative or original.

Maybe knowing the book was written based on the movie, probably the screenplay, may have biased me.<br /><br />It was not at all like reading a \\"normal\\" novel, like a bestseller.  It was like what it purported to be: an author given the probably unenviable task of \\"cripping\\" on a screenplay to come up with a book.<br /><br />But, I could see where the movie would be better, because you do need the bodily aspect, the dancing, and the music, to make this story work.  The book has none of that.  The cover has pictures of the actors, but that's it.<br /><br />The build-up to the climax, when the men dance, seemed too long and repetitive, the same kind of failings happening over and over.  Finally, the climax, when the men dance and \\"all is forgiven,\\" and everyone lives happily ever after; it's too much like a fairy tale.<br /><br />I guess that was the intention of the original writers, to make it like a modern fairy tale.

Okay, I'm 57 myself.  <br /> <br />I just could not buy that Stephanie, who could be this man's daughter, fell in love with him at that age.  What kind of a life are they going to have, the man is going to be in a rest home in ten years (sorry seniors).   <br /> <br />Anyway, the whole thing is not as bad as some reviewers have painted it, because, partly, it leaves us amateurs a lot of room to make criticisms. <br /> <br />Diximus.	2005-03-24

Nonetheless, the book is still useful as it is, for students of statistics, or, indeed, for anyone who reads newspapers and magazines and comes across statistics there. <br /> <br />The book is not too much more interesting than a textbook, but the author does attempt to make it seem so, adding cartoons and writing in a \\"chatty\\" style.  He helps readers by categorizing various statistical flaws and fallacies into one of several areas.  He also provides relatively simple explanations of correlation and regression analysis, topics usually difficult to comprehend. <br /> <br />One aspect that Campbell, the author, seems to overlook, or deem not worth commenting on, is that most of his examples are drawn from the public media.  What goes unwritten and unsaid is that the media seem to have a vested interest in distorting statistics, for the simple reason that they want to impress readers with clearly unusual, clearly frightening, or other clear differences between what they expected and what was found.  The media are out to report news, but they are certainly not averse to \\"making\\" news, if it can be done through a fallacious reporting of statistics.  Campbell never mentions this, but it is clear to see, reading his examples. <br /> <br />Anyone who has taken college-level courses in scientific methodology or statistics will already be familiar with many of Campbell's most egregious errors: such as drawing conclusions about an entire population from a small and/or non-random sample; or such as concluding that one variable causes another variable, because they correlate highly.  For these students, the book provides an excellent review. <br /> <br />Diximus. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-20

The essays are apparently reprints of columns that Ms. Loh wrote for a magazine.  <br /> <br />I found the book interesting and sometimes funny.  Sandra might be classified as a humor writer with just a few more funny lines, but here she makes some pertinent observations and sprinkles in humor like a condiment. <br /> <br />For example, she writes about her \\"confrontation\\" with Christianity.  God is a fiftyish guy, a little on the heavy side, who enjoys a nice glass of wine.  She cannot, she says, really imagine God as a female, but if she did, she would think of an older woman in overalls gardening somewhere in Topanga Canyon. <br /> <br />Sandra writes well about various \\"wannabe\\" endeavors, to which we all can relate.  She wants to be a better-known writer and performance artist.  But when she goes to an agency that promises to put her on film in advertising, we see what it's really all about: People who \\"wannabe,\\" no matter what their particular lust, are ripe suckers for a host of other people who want to humor them briefly, while taking their money. <br /> <br />Can you relate?  Law school, modeling, acting, you name it...we've all been wannabes somewhere, sometime.  Sandra is the quintessential wannabe, but she's taken and fashioned it into a creative rift and made something interesting and funny out of it.   <br /> <br />I recommend you read this book and do it quickly, because it's full of time-sensitive material, which may not age too well.  That's the only problem here. <br /> <br />Diximus. <br /> <br />	2005-03-17

It's a great book, totally absorbing from beginning to end, well, close to the end.  At the very end, the writer talks of \\"falling in love.\\"  But this part seems very phony.  How can a sex addict really bond with someone?  He wants his cake and wants to eat it, too.  The poor fellow was infatuated, yes, maybe because his \\"love\\" already had somebody, but he was no way in love. <br /> <br />But that's the end of the book.  Everywhere else, the book is just startling with Larry Edward's sex life.  Here's a man who writes literally nothing about his work.  We know only that he worked in an office in New York City.  He writes a little bit about his daughter, but it's clear she is not his main concern.  His main concern is women, young women.  He tries to convince us that he was selective, since he shied away from married women or women under 18 (he did have sex with one 18-year old).  But this man definitely had a problem bonding with women.  He yo-yo's with his wife for a few years, but finally they divorce (I don't recall him saying who actually sued for the divorce). <br /> <br />Can you believe all these \\"fairy\\" tales?  Well, the paperback version of this book is clearly marked \\"non-fiction.\\"  The publishers have promoted the writing as non-fiction.  But it is hard to believe, and on the other hand, it's easy to see how some homely schmuck could have turned his sexual fantasies into a book like this. <br /> <br />Let's assume that the story is entirely true.  What did this man have that was so attractive to women that they were calling him up for sex, continuously, as he paints it in this book?   <br /> <br />He must have been a hell of a good looking man, a real beautiful stud of some kind, or else the women in New York were pretty hard up, or maybe both. <br /> <br />We have to remember, too, that this book pre-dates the beginning of the spread of AIDS, so Larry and his lovers had no worries about spreading life-threatening viruses through multiple sex contacts.  Larry could not do what he did then, today.  He'd be dead or dying. <br /> <br />As a writer, Larry is insightful and honest, for the most part, with the exception of the last section, where tries to convince us that he finally came to know what \\"love\\" is.  I wasn't convinced.  The man is a narcissistic pig with the ability to sit down and write about it, and even make us sometimes feel pity for him (not getting enough?). <br /> <br />If the story is true.  I have my doubts.  But so what?  It's still a great read, true or not.  It aroused me, I admit, but I wouldn't want to be like Larry.  I'd rather find real love, not his ersatz infatuation with Celeste.  Horse manure.  Diximus.    <br />	2005-03-11

Someone said in a review on this website that they didn't laugh out loud once.  I did, several times.  It's funny, because Toby makes fun of himself. <br /> <br />But he stays true to his inner nature, and stands against the forces of social society in the New York publishing world.   <br /> <br />Toby found that the fashion world, at least with respect to publishing, was based on a religious attitude, a \\"religion I couldn't take seriously.\\"  This religion is based, essentially, on chasing new fads.  This isn't surprising, since the publishing world must earn its nickel by selling \\"news\\" to the public.  It's the same with newspapers in general. <br /> <br />But, as Young cites Tocqueville, \\"It's an extreme form of materialism....an obsession with bodily pleasures at the expense of the immortal soul.\\"  Well, Toby was a non-believer in the Conde Nast world, but from my own perspective, his indictment of the materialistic cravings there could apply all over the country.  In fact, it seems that it's inherent in capitalism itself, that is, the pursuit of gain by exchanging value for value.  It doesn't hurt the \\"newness priests\\" to invent something as new as often as possible. <br /> <br />Toby made many good points like this.  He paints himself as a loser and an outsider, and so he probably was, but he finds love in the end and returns to his London home.   <br /> <br />I learned much from this book, and I could identify with Toby Young as an outsider and non-believer.  Many organizations have the same insider/outsider bifurcation, and those who don't worship in the right way may be ex-communicated pretty quickly. <br /> <br />Toby also addresses the matter of sibling rivalry and competition following us throughout our lives.  The book has an index, a rarity these days, and I'm using it right now to find a quote by Gore Vidal, as follows: \\"Every time a friend succeeds, I die a little.\\"  Toby adds: \\"This, in turn explains why we feel a sudden rush of elation on hearing about some terrible calamity that has befallen one of our friends.\\" <br /> <br />And you know, I'm that way, too, but I always believed that I was the only one and had to do everything I could to hide such anti-social feelings.  It helped to read this exposition: sibling rivalry throughout life is not that uncommon. <br /> <br />Diximus. <br /> <br />   <br />	2005-03-02

Yes, the sub-title is \\"a real diary.\\"  Do publishers lie?  You bet they do, if they can get away with it.  And who is going to call them on it, when the author is as prolific as \\"Anonymous.\\" <br /> <br />But, the little book is gripping anyway, as good as a novel.  This poor young lady just seems so naive, like, duh.  I grew up in the 60s and 70s, too, but I don't remember people putting acid on chocolate covered peanuts too much, or anything for that matter.  That seems fabricated, but it is interesting.  This young Anonymous goes through a journey and a half, and do you believe she died?  Well, since she never lived, I don't think she died.  The ghostwriter of this diary will die one day, hopefully of natural causes, but the publisher isn't saying anything about that. <br /> <br />This is a good book to learn some things, and I see 1,000 reviewers have read it so far, quite high as far as this site goes per book.  Yes, it could have happened the way it's painted here, but not written down in a diary.  Today, maybe, an online diary might be possible, but even that takes a lot of discipline.  Drug users very rarely, if ever, have the discipline to keep diaries, especially carry them around with them when they leave home and all that. <br /> <br />Diximus.	2005-03-01

Antonio Marez starts telling us his story at the age of about 5, before starting school, and then takes us through a few years until, as a self-defined \\"man,\\" he tells his mother to take his sisters away, in the face of the final tragedy.   <br /> <br />And that final tragedy is..........? <br /> <br />The death of his beloved Ultima, the curandera who has blessed him.   <br /> <br />Antonio is the youngest son of a cowboy-type father (Marez) and a mother from a farm people (Luna).  Unlike his brothers, who take after their father, Antonio has a lot of his mother in him, and spends time learning to farm with the Lunas.  His mother would like him to become a priest, or at least a \\"man of learning.\\" <br /> <br />So, this is a sort of \\"coming out\\" novel, but the protagonist is younger than usual and he never does really come out, in that sense.  Catcher in the Rye this book is not.   <br /> <br />His school mates are pretty funny, with one tragedy, Florence, the non-believer, who drowns.  I think some of the names didn't translate well, especially Florence.  Florencio is a fine name in Spanish, but Florence in English is almost always a female name.  Same with Bones (Calaveras), Horse (Caballo), etc., they are nicknames that sound a lot better in Spanish than when they are translated into English.   <br /> <br />Tenorio?  Well, he is painted as evil, and he does act pretty stupidly, but Ultima does show her true nature when she tells Antonio to forgive him (Christ-like, \\"for they know not what they do\\").   <br /> <br />This book is worth reading, but it will take a while to finish it.  Maybe have something a little lighter on the side to read while you dip in and out at intervals, like other chores you have to do little by little.  Diximus.	2005-02-23

The book's drawback is that it is necessarily restricted to that decade, and earlier.  It hasn't been updated like a college textbook, edition after edition, although conceivably, it could be so updated. <br /> <br />Mr. Kent talked to many people in the movie business, from actors to directors to producers to studio executives and agents.  The book presents \\"naked\\" Hollywood in the sense that Kent describes how emotions, including especially Hollywood's version of machismo, play a large role in running the business. <br /> <br />At one point, Kent writes that creative people are generally anxious about the opinions of others.  This struck me as a true statement, and worthy of reflection. <br /> <br />Creative people, unless they are satisfied with their creations in themselves, always have to look to others for recognition and approval.  Especially actors and actresses, poor souls, but musicians, artists, etc., the same thing.   <br /> <br />I wonder how many creative people there are who actually never look for approval from others, and recognition, but are happy with their own creations?  Hobbyists?   <br /> <br />Anyway, this book has many interesting photographs and I'm surprised no one has reviewed it heretofore.  It will probably be a collectible someday.

This little book is a first-person account by Peggy Caserta (with Dan Knapp), and Peggy Caserta just about reeks from every page.   <br /> <br />The book reads like a novel, it's that engrossing.  There's plenty of sex, mostly Peggy with female lovers, but she loves men, too.  Some of her male idols, like Big Brother Sam Andrew, are painted as selfish, wimpy pigs.  I see from his web page that Brother Sam has tried to make a writing career.  Not a groupy, I'd never heard of him before reading this book, and after reading it I don't want to know any more. <br /> <br />Another Big Brother, Peter Albin, indicated that Peggy's book was a sell-out to capitalize on her relationship with Janis, to make money to feed her drug habit.  Whatever.   <br /> <br />There's not too much available on Janis, and this little memoir fills a gap, I think.  Peggy holds no punches.  I guess Dan Knapp helped her to keep from sounding like Peter Albin's sell-out.   <br /> <br />Peggy, instead, seems in this book like a loving person, kind of a big-sister-lover to Janis, as well as to another young lady (her Debbie from L.A.) and at the same time Peggy was a steady lover to a more \\"butch\\" lady, her girlfriend, Kimmie.   <br /> <br />Then there are all the other personalities of that day and age, late 1960s and early 1970s in the Bay Area and in Los Angeles and at Woodstock.  One scene Peggy writes, I'll not soon forget: her and Janis fixing inside a stinky at Woodstock, with girls outside crying to come in, they have to defecate.  \\"We know what you're doing in there, Janis!\\" one waiting girl supposedly called through the stinky door.  Paranoid, Janis was like, \\"How could they know????\\" <br /> <br />Janis seems more like a side figure in this memoir, well, a main side figure, but still the book tells much more about Peggy than about Janis, which is of course how a personal memoir has to be.   <br /> <br />Janis is gone, but, as they say, her spirit lives on in the next and the next generation.  She was a unique individual, apparently a talented artist (I didn't especially like her music, but she was obviously unique, and by the way, I was there in Berkeley when she and Big Brother started out....I used to see Country Joe and the Fish in the People's Park in Berkeley in 1967-1968, where they gave free concerts). <br /> <br />Diximus. <br />	2005-02-05

Allende for writing so clearly in her own native language, which she prefers to English.   <br /> <br />I learned a lot, especially in the latter half of the book, about the election of Allende's relative (Salvador Allende) as the socialist president of the country (Chile) and his subsequent overthrow by the military.  The book is realistic (almost non-fiction, like a roman a clef) in following those events.   <br /> <br />Those events, which happened some thirty years ago, were brought into sharp focus, and it was a little scary.  I have lived in Central America, Guatemala, where there is also a constant tension between the so-called guerillas and the military/industrial powers, and it's not like living in the U.S.   <br /> <br />Allende's character, Alba, felt the brunt of it (she was arrested and tortured), and so did her grandfather, the venerable Senator Trueba, even with all his connections with the \\"right\\" side of the ledger (he was friends with the big-wig General Hurtado........Pinochet?). <br /> <br />This story proceeds through several generations, beginning with Trueba as a young man, striking off on his own and falling in love with a beautiful young lady from an \\"eligible\\" family (Rosa).  Rosa dies unexpectedly, so Trueba marries her sister, Clara, the clairvoyant, and the story goes on from there. <br /> <br />Some readers may not like the intergenerational strategy as a plotting device, but if you want to learn about families in Chile, where there has always been a gap between the haves (from criollo or Spanish families) and the have-nots (Indian or indigenous peoples), this is a good format to increase learning and understanding, because it encompasses all the various nuances and twists.  For example, none of Trueba's three children follow him in his temperament or in his politics, in fact, his twin sons are diametrically his opposite temperamentally and politically.  I wanted to find out what happened to Nicolas, but Allende never gets back to him after he tries ballooning over the Andes. <br /> <br />And then you have the so-called mestizos, the children of both groups, and so you have basically a tripartite society, which is as Allende describes it, Alba being essentially the child of Pedro Tercero Garcia, an indigenous \\"rebel,\\" and Alba's mother Blanca, a full-blooded Spanish-descent person. <br /> <br />In the U.S., the analogy may be with the slave-holders of the Southern states, and then the (usually) unacknowledged offspring of white and black (for example, W.E.B. Dubois) who later led Black civil rights movements against the \\"powers that be.\\" <br /> <br />If you like short, sweet stories, this book is not for you.  But you can learn a lot if you give the book a try.   <br /> <br />Diximus.	2005-01-27

Adams has a satiric style that helps the reader to see how silly some of our conventions and traditions are, or seem to be when set against the backdrop of the entire galaxy. <br /> <br />Adams's style of writing seems to take a \\"follow your nose\\" approach.  One word or phrase leads him to jump to a different thought, and the effect is that of meandering through a constantly changing environment.  The reader's imagination is stimulated by all the images, such as Arthur and Fenchurch gravitating over her home, and watching a bicycle thief attempting, and failing, to steal her bike (he vandalizes it instead). <br /> <br />Arthur and Fenchurch travel to Southern California to attempt to answer the question bothering Fenchurch, \\"Where did all the dolphins go?\\"  This trip to Southern California may evoke smiles and outright laughter in readers from Southern California (including this reviewer).  They catch up there with Wonka the Sane, who had communicated extensively with the dolphins before they disappeared, and was given their final pronunciation, which is the title of the book. <br /> <br />Adams provides the reader with much-needed and much-appreciated comic relief, and because he satirizes the science fiction genre, he has his own special niche, upon which other humor writers (I like Dave Barry) have not yet encroached.  Another thing about Adams is his use of what Americans might call Anglicisms, which may seem quaint and different to American readers (me).  Much of his local scenery is England.  Fenchurch got her name because she was born in Fenchurch train station.  If you are a sucker for British writers, like me, you will get a double kick out of Douglas Adams.

It's a little hard slogging through the rain and the mud with Traveller.  You may really feel like you, too, are in the Army of Northern Virginia, wondering what all the loud banging noise and cloth on sticks are about, just like the narrator, Robert E. Lee's horse. <br /> <br />It is a sleeper, too, in the sense that the whole idea of a talking, thinking horse will creep up on you.   <br /> <br />By the end of the book, it will make you sad to have to say goodbye to old Traveller, the old soldier who still believes his guys won the war, doesn't know his beloved master has passed on, and is still telling long war stories to his friend, the Lee's pet cat, Tom. <br /> <br />You may get a pretty accurate sense of what the Civil War looked like from General Lee's horse's perspective.  Traveller is certainly eloquent, in a down home kind of way.  Even though, as one of his fellow horses noted, he may not be too smart in the ways of the human world, he does have a lot of horse sense.  He's 100% loyal to his master, who, Traveller believes, may have lived a previous life as a horse himself. <br /> <br />We don't learn a whole lot about General Lee, compared to what we learn about Traveller.  Lee does seem to be unafraid of dying, he's always good to animals and to his troops, but it is clear he doesn't have the manpower and material tools needed to win the war. <br /> <br />Adams has inserted excerpts from a \\"human\\" writer, apparently a contemporary Southern historian or journalist, throughout the text.  These excerpts help the reader to understand what all the slogging around in the mud in rain mean, in terms of battles and locations.   <br /> <br />For someone who knows little about the Civil War (me), many more of these explanatory inserts into Traveller's narration would have been helpful to understand what exactly was going on and where the battlefields actually were.  The historical relevance of Traveller's travels would have been made more clear.  Civil War buffs would have no problem knowing all that. <br /> <br />I recommend this book, although it is not easy reading and it may take you a while to finish the book.  Take your time.

Why?  Because they so rapidly become outdated. <br /> <br />Everyone was making less in 1994.  Is that what inflation does?   <br /> <br />Easton's job market projections do go to 2005, so those are still useful, for another year anyway.   <br /> <br />Easton did a good job of pulling together all the occupations that could possibly be included under \\"science,\\" including some that are usually included only under \\"business,\\" such as accounting and bookkeeping. <br /> <br />Easton notes in the preface that the book is for young people exploring possible careers, but can be used by anyone exploring careers, including those changing careers later in life.   <br /> <br />I liked his take on career-changers: he finds them refreshing and not as stodgy as some who find a niche and never let go.

Nothing really happened throughout, not what I would call much of a novel.  There's a lot of yada yada, but virtually no action. <br /> <br />Do you like romances?  This is, I believe, a romance, but of a little bit different genre than the usual romance, since it deals with same-sex love.   <br /> <br />Daniel Stephenson, the narrator of this dry saga, seems just like the author's alter ego.  In that sense, it seems like an autobiography, and maybe it is.   <br /> <br />Daniel moves from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and finds an extended family among the gay crowd of New York City.  He finds a job as a female impersonator but loses it when the lady in question, Princess Diana Spencer, dies in a car accident (1997). <br /> <br />Daniel relocates to get a new lease on life in addition to his new property lease.  He spots his dream man through a window across the way, and, guess what, Blaine is gay, too.  And, Blaine has a good job, so he hires Daniel to be his assistant in a big advertising corporation. <br /> <br />This is the whole story, believe it or not.  The big suspense is whether or not Blaine is going to discover that Daniel was once a female impersonator. <br /> <br />I read this book to try to understand homosexuality better.  It didn't help a lot in that regard, but I am convinced now that these men really do fall in love with each other.   <br /> <br />One thing about Timothy James Beck, he's definitely authentic.  He had to live what Daniel lives through in this book, in order to write it.

This is a nicely illustrated little book (48 pages) targeting young readers.  It is one in a 53-book series called, \\"Portrait of America,\\" published by Steck-Vaughn, covering each state plus Washington DC, Puerto Rico, and Pacific Islands. <br /> <br />The book accomplishes what it probably was supposed to accomplish, that is, to provide a rough overview of Arizona, its history, its peoples, and its current status. <br /> <br />The only thing that jumped out at me is on page 15, where Thompson writes, \\"Lawmen such as Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and Bat Masterson came to town around 1881.\\" <br /> <br />This may be a minor point that only Western buffs would note, but Doc Holliday was definitely not a \\"lawman.\\"  Yes, he fought on the side of the Earps and was friends with Masterson, but he was never deputized, as far as I could find in his biographical materials.   <br /> <br />So what?  Who cares?  Well, it just seems like someone writing a history should be a little more attentive to detail.  Sliding over this detail may give readers a totally wrong impression about Doc Holliday.  Compared to Earp and Masterson, he was really just a tubercular dentist, fast with a gun and handy with a knife (he killed several men), who loved to gamble.  A very interesting personage, but not a lawman. <br /> <br />Anyway, that's the only part I can complain about.  Otherwise, the little book was informative, and it made me want to avoid Arizona even more than I had before reading it (too hot, not enough water).  Diximus.	2004-12-13

Except to manage myself, that's plenty. <br /> <br />As far as other people, well, yes, I see that managers are needed in the profit economy: They have to make sure that the workers (labor) help maximize the profit of the company. <br /> <br />W. Steven Brown does have experience in this area, and he sprinkles his personal stories throughout this book.  The personal stories are the best part.  I think he should have written a book only with personal stories.  A lot of the other stuff is dull and common sensical. <br /> <br />Brown comes through this book as a reasonable person, a consultant and a self-described teacher.  What he seems to lack, what the whole capitalist system seems to lack, is heart, not the organ itself of course but the feeling of thinking beyond the system, outside of the system.  Heart could mean treating people as individuals rather than a piece of the system.  It's not Brown's fault, that's just the way the capitalist system works. <br /> <br />And it probably wouldn't work if managers were humanitarians and altruists.  This is what Brown is emphasizing.  Yes, they have to give the illusion of being humanitarians and altruists, but they can't actually be that.  They have to ensure that the bottom line is black, or, guess what, they lose. <br /> <br />I like John Heider's book, The Tao of Leadership, better.  Those who lead least lead best.  Yes, this may be an unachievable ideal in the capitalist society, but I'm a dreamer, I mentioned that, not a manager.  <br /> <br />Diximus.	2004-12-13

There's a poignant story about it here.     <br /> <br />I learned a lot about Nigeria from these stories.  Sometimes, the stories seemed to end a little too abruptly, but I guess that's part of the story format: it has to end sooner than a short novel, anyway. <br /> <br />Mr. Achebe is a fine storyteller and he has many interesting things to say about the people and customs of Nigeria.  I recommend this book, but only after first reading his classic novel about 19th century Ibo tribe people, Things Fall Apart. <br /> <br />After reading these stories, I was both attracted to Nigeria and repelled by it (I've never been to Africa).  Achebe does a good job of capturing the ambivalence aroused by Nigeria's exotic nature (to Americans) mixed with its societal dysfunctions. <br /> <br />Diximus. <br />	2004-12-06

It's far more than that.  It's a long parable, that's what it really is, and it crackles from beginning to end with emotion and with the earthiness of the characters in the novel. <br /> <br />One thing you will probably notice right away: These African (Ibo) people will remind you very much of what we imagine of Native American peoples.  There are many similarities, with their seeming superstition and strange metaphysical systems; with their dependence on and obeisance to their tribal customs; and with their apparently primitive customs.   <br /> <br />I felt sorry for all of the people of Umuofina and Mbanta and the other villages, because I know what happened to them.  They were destroyed by so-called missionaries, who were backed up by the technology and forcefulness of the so-called civilized worlds (England). <br /> <br />It's bathetic.  No, I don't mean pathetic.   <br /> <br />I felt so privileged to be able to read this author, who is, above all, authentic.  He knows whereof he writes, and, for whatever reason, not too many others can fill his shoes in this respect.  He opened up a world to me that I would otherwise never have known or understood.  It's too bad that it was a tragically closing world.  It's too bad that \\"things fell apart,\\" and that Okonkwo, the angry man who could not reconcile himself to these changes, takes his own life in the end.   <br /> <br />Okonkwo had his hang-ups, for sure, but you can't help but respect the guy.  He's a tragic hero of the first class, and in that respect he stands for all the native African people who have had Christianity and \\"civilization\\" forced down their throats, back in his day (19th century) and, I would suppose, still today. <br /> <br />It reminded me of what sometimes happened in my grade school.  Kids would gang up on some poor fellow because they thought he was aggressive, only to find out later he was perfectly harmless.  This is what happened to Okonkwo and his people.  They got cold-cocked for no reason other than fear on the part of their oppressors, when all the while, they only wanted to live their own lives without bothering anyone else. <br /> <br />This novel will arouse very bittersweet types of emotions in you, and, as a parable, it will make you think hard about your own life.  Are you trying to convert people who want only to lead their own lives?  Are you beating up on someone who would not, probably could not, harm you?  I hope I'm not, and I hope you're not, because you'll be real sorry later.  No, Okonkwo's gods will not haunt you, but your own mind will (unless you have no conscience, and sometimes I wonder if a lot of people don't).  <br /> <br />This novel is a classic.  Read it and feel the pain!  Diximus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-12-02

The book seems to target young readers, high school age, but adults can benefit, too. <br /> <br />Two things impressed me.  First, the vast ages (thousands to hundreds of millions of years) of life on the planet, and our little flicker of 75 plus years compared to that. <br /> <br />Second, the fact that paleontologists, and other scientists, are only making educated guesses about most of what they suppose happened during those past eons. <br /> <br />Though she does not emphasize the point, Lauber makes it clear through her phrases, that scientists are only proposing hypotheses about dinosaurs.  These phrases are such as, \\"Other paleontologists agree....\\"  \\"Perhaps further digging will settle the question and tell more about these big dinosaurs...\\"  \\"Earth scientists now think.........\\" <br /> <br />Clearly, much of what is purported to be true in this field is based only on still questionable hypotheses.  This is another thing I learned from this little book. <br /> <br />Paleontology, the study of old things, is a field that may not appeal to too many people.  Sure, people like to imagine dinosaurs roaming around, fighting each other, chasing people in a Flintstonesque or Jurassic Park world, because then it has some relevance to their worlds.  Mostly, however, the world of dinosaurs seems to have little relevance to today's world. <br /> <br />To her credit, Lauber does not try to dramatize the dinosaur world, as Hollywood has done.  But maybe she should have, to make it more interesting?  As described in this book, the field is stable, about like the moving continents, which she describes in the last chapter.  The continents are shifting on their tectonic plates at a rate of approximately one inch a year. <br /> <br />The back cover of the book tells us that Lauber won several awards for a 1987 book she wrote about volcanoes.  She won awards from the American Library Association and the 1987 Newbery Honor Book award.  \\"Dinosaurs\\" was written the same year, 1987.   <br /> <br />Now, what I'd like to know is, \\"What kind of people actually do become professional paleontologists?\\"  That is relevant, is it not? <br /> <br />Diximus.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-11-28

Everything seems authentic, with nice illustrations.   <br /> <br />In fine detail, the story of the Boston Tea Party is a bit different than what we know today as the legend, but the essentials are the same: the colonists boarded three British ships and threw the crates of tea overboard, due to a tax on tea which they objected to. <br /> <br />Benjamin Hatcher is a seller of tea and makes it clear why he opposes the tax: people can't afford it.  There's a black market in tea imported from other sources, while the Tea Party is going on.   <br /> <br />Interesting and well written. <br /> <br />Diximus.	2004-11-27

It is probably considered out of date. <br /> <br />But it has some great photographs of Chavez all through his life.  It has a short, concise biography.   <br /> <br />What did I learn?  Chavez's grandfather immigrated from Mexico and fathered 14 children.  Cesar's father was the last one to leave the family home and married rather late, at the age of 38. <br /> <br />Cesar did not like school, nor did he like the English language.   <br /> <br />He fasted three times for over three weeks each.  This must have been tough and may have indelibly harmed his health.   <br /> <br />So, this book of course was published before Chavez's birthday became a state holiday in California.

This little book of 29 pages was published in 1985 and may be considered out-of-date now (it was discarded by at least one local library this year).<br /><br />But if you consider that not much has changed in the history of Native Americans since 1985, it may still be a good read for young people interested in the topic.  I recommend it.<br /><br />Discussed are the four main tribal groups who lived between Canada and Florida when Columbus landed.  These were the Algonquins, the Iroquois Nation (including the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, and Mohawk), the Creek Confederacy in the Southeast(including the Muskhogee and Seminoles), and the Great Lakes group, including the Sauk, Fox, Shawnee and Winnebago.<br /><br />Do you know what a calumet is?

Well, it might have been, but somehow, we know (I knew) that Darby was going to make it in the end and the \\"bad guys\\" were going to have their comeuppance.  That was never in doubt. <br /> <br />So, not so scary. <br /> <br />What was interesting was Grisham's description of the law firms, and the lawyers, in Washington, D.C.  This was eye-opening, the numbers, the morals, and the career ladder that such people follow.   <br /> <br />What was interesting, but stupid, was the President.  It's hard to imagine a President this stupid, but I wonder was the model Mr. Ron?  And this golfer President turns the real business of running the nation over to a young smoothy by the name of Fletcher Coal, who is one of the \\"bad guys,\\" in a way, but he has some good traits, too: He can work incessantly and seems to be pretty intelligent.

Martini, writing in the first person through his attorney narrator, Paul Madriani, is engaging and colloquial.  Paul is a likable person, even though he is an attorney, and so is his sidekick, Harry Hinds.  In fact, there really are not any despicable people here in this novel, and that is what is so great, for a novel.  Most novels have to ride on the back of some villain.  Martini has not done that.  There are no real villains in this story. <br /> <br />The perpetrator is a sick man, but he is not evil.  In fact, he is an artist, of a sort, a carpentry artist.  That is somewhat unusual, too, because usually artists are intropunitive, like Van Gogh (cutting off his own ear, and all that), not extropunitive and murderous, blaming others for their problems.  It makes you think.   <br /> <br />Anyway, Frank Boyd, the killer in question, is not evil.  He is deeply troubled, by the life-threatening illness of his own daughter.  Who can't relate to this paternal love? <br /> <br />There are no villainous people here.  Tannery, the prosecutor, and his boss, Tate, the head D.A., are somewhat misguided in their goals and objectives, and that's where the real conflict comes into Martini's story.  Tannery is prosecuting the wrong man, and is doing so for what appear to be partially self-serving reasons, to further his own career.   <br /> <br />Martini has done a lot with a little here, and he therein shows himself to be above the rest of the crowd of novelists, but about at the same level as some of his attorney-novelist cohorts.  Attorneys do seem to make good novelists, now that they have seen fit to pass through that gate, following Grisham, Turow, et al.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.  You'll enjoy it and learn some things at the same time (for instance, what is molecular computing?).       <br /> <br />Diximus. <br />	2004-11-14

The bad guys, well, they're the most fun, but they're not realistic.  Carl Herbold is a psychopath or sociopath or something, but he's not believable.  Emory Lomax, the same thing.  These two fellows have no altruistic motives, as the author admits, but even sociopaths fear God, don't they?  These guys don't.  They're caricatures of evil, not real people.    If you like caricatures, you find them here, and that's all you find.  It makes for simple reading, because there are no complex characters who have a mixture of some good traits and some bad.  Carl is worse than Satan, if you can imagine that.  Emory, too.  They are Satan's little helpers in Blewert County, or wherever it is.    Jack, on the other hand, is a righteous free spirit, another old Western caricature.  He likes little children and falls in love with the heroine, Anna, who is deaf.  Jack is almost totally on the good-guy side, except he's so lusty.  Righteous and lusty, is that a Western good guy, or what?    Delray Corbett is in denial: he helped raise the two screw-up stepsons but wants to deny responsibility.  He's a tough old coot, another caricature.    Cecil Herbold, you can almost feel sorry for.  His girlfriend, Connie Skaggs, is unbelievable.  She works in a bank?  And then kills someone in a bank robbery on goes the lam with this lunatic squad?  Didn't she forget her toothbrush?  Don't women need clothes when they're fleeing with four males?  Not Connie, I guess.  Seems like she has a death wish, and she gets her wish, of course.  Are there really women like that?  Bonnie Parker?    Well, you will learn that American Sign Language differs from Signed English.  And East Texas has tornadoes.  Otherwise, you can look forward to having your emotions titillated, because that's what Brown's writing is all about, I guess.  A sorry soap opera, and that's what some folks love.  She's so prolific and successful, it must be that.  This is my first book I've read by her, and I did get titillated, I can't deny it.  But is it worth it?  Well, you decide, this is what I found.

And no Cody.   <br /> <br />Maybe this was more like Steinbeck's \\"Travels with Charley.\\"   <br /> <br />In fact, Charles is so discreet, he even rebuffs a woman of possible ill repute in Key West.  Oh ye of great faith! <br /> <br />But he hardly ever mentions his wife, maybe once or twice at the end.  Was she happy just sitting at home?  Or maybe she was traveling elsewhere?  Anyway, I think it's too bad they could not have traveled together.   <br /> <br />It was sad, though, when his father died, even though his father was pretty old (late 80s I think).   <br /> <br />Of all the places he visited, I think I did like Key West best, because that was really the place that was furthest away from the American mainstream, except maybe Alaska, and I would prefer to travel outside of the country than in.

It may help some believing Christians who need help in these areas. <br /> <br />I'm a lapsed Christian, I guess, but parts of this book were still helpful to me.  I liked the chapter, \\"Who signs your paycheck?\\"  The author writes: \\"Your boss and your employer are not your source....Your talent is not your source.......All of the circumstances and talents in your life are only the instruments that God can use to bless you.\\" <br /> <br />I liked this part because we tend to bowled over by the economic/social system that so strongly emphasizes employment, usually with someone besides yourself as \\"the boss.\\"  In our current American \\"capitalist\\" culture, the employers seem to control everything, and a person is considered lucky to have a job, especially a job with good pay. <br /> <br />This kind of employer-favorable dogma is hard to resist, much less overcome, in our world.

His metamorphosis is evident in these writings (he died in 1973, right after this book was published). <br /> <br />Watts has little sympathy for the established Christian churches and instead finds sustenance in Zen, Taoism, and Hinduism.   <br /> <br />Personally, I found sustenance in his writings here.  He doesn't give a whole lot of what we might call \\"practical\\" advice, except to meditate, but that's the point of his teachings: \\"So long, then, as we are concerned with powers, we are still aiming at increased control of nature and aggravating our frustrations.\\"  The \\"Western\\" efforts to control nature, Watts feels, are self-defeating. <br /> <br />\\"You, as ego, cannot change what you are feeling, and you cannot, effectively, try not to change it.\\"   <br /> <br />You may get the dichotomous drift of what he is saying in these few quotations.

That was considered a good book in its day, and I did finish it.

But I can say that I personally know of at least one other avid reader who also did not like this book.  Diximus.	2004-10-14

Isn't it a middleman who serves as the agent for a seller?  Rarely, the salesperson will serve as an agent for the customer or buyer.<br /><br />Thus, there is a basic contradiction in the lives of most salespeople: they are working on their own behalves and for their suppliers or sellers, but the customer necessarily comes third.  This is part of the capitalist system and Jack Carew's little pointers are hardly going to change that, no matter that he dresses it up with \\"spiritual\\" recommendations.<br /><br />To get to the spiritual, the salesperson would finally have to give up playing the \\"getting game\\" for himself or herself, but when that happens, the game is over.  No more \\"success\\" in worldly terms, in terms of monetary gain, in terms of quantity of sales, or even \\"happiness\\" of the customers.<br /><br />A new game has started, that of the spiritual paradox (the sound of one hand clapping?): You give up striving to do for yourself, you give up striving to make the sale, you give up striving to gain the monetary reward, and paradoxically, life takes care of itself.<br /><br />Don't believe it?  Try it.  Try it, Jack Carew.  Quit trying to swing people over to materialism and capitalism by throwing in a few spiritually-oriented words.  It won't work.  They're in basic opposition.  The way of the world is not the way of the spirit.  Sorry to be so preachy.  Diximus.	2004-10-13

Otherwise, you may not like it at all.  Unless you can identify with the idea of a high school reunion.  That is, essentially, what this is, a high school reunion.    Eddie Rake has taken over for Jesus Christ in this little town.  Listen to Neely's eulogy: \\"We leave here today without the physical presence of our Coach.  But his spirit will live in the hearts and minds and souls of all the young boys he touched....His spirit will move us and motivate us and comfort us for the rest of our lives...\\"    Heck, who needs Jesus when you got Eddie Rake?  Notice \\"Coach\\" capitalized just like \\"Christ.\\"    It's a sad comment on American high schools that the football coach is glorified over our religious heroes, but this does seem to be realistic assessment on Grisham's part: football is more important than spiritual matters to many kids in high school and, for that matter, to all those Americans who religiously follow football, or any sport, and idolize sports heroes.    False idols?  You bet they are, but hey, that's life.  Or is it?  Do we really need these sports heroes, these \\"Vince Lombardi\\" coaches, these \\"no pain, no gain\\" ethics.    Well, at least Neely's ex-girlfriend, Cameron, has her priorities straight.  Or she seems to, anyway.    It was a mystic named Henri Amiel who said the human spirit grows as we grow beyond our animal characteristics (this is a paraphrase).  If this is so, then the people in Messina, indeed in all of America, may be heading in the wrong direction.      Another way of looking at sports and hero worship is as a sublimation of our own feelings of aggression (which we can't express), or the \\"bread and circuses\\" theory.  Football, and hero worship, provide the circuses we need to keep us droning away, to earn our bread toiling at boring jobs which do not offer the emotional and physical outlets we can vicariously enjoy through our sports heroes.All these issues come to mind while reading this little book.  Even though the radio announcer's play-by-play description of the \\"heroic\\" playoff game is a colossal bore, you can skip that part without losing any of the book's essence.  The rest of the book is easy reading and goes fast.      And the book is provocative, in the \\"philosophical\\" ways described by these questions here.  Grisham will make you take sides on various issues, whether or not you want to.    Diximus.	2004-10-12

It reminded me, with the dialogue format, of some of the \\"channeling\\" books (like Seth or the Course on Miracles), but without even the substance of those books.   <br /> <br />Rather, the authors seemed to concentrate on people's childhood troubles, just as a psychoanalyst would, regressing them so as to uncover the beginnings of their psychological problems.   <br /> <br />This, to me, is not a useful procedure, but obviously, some people are helped by it.  For those who cannot afford psychotherapy, maybe this little book is a fair substitute.   <br /> <br />I personally would need something a little more substantial and down-to-earth.

He said Mr. Bill Clinton had also recommended it, having read it after his friend, the attorney Vincent Foster, committed suicide. <br /> <br />Styron experienced depression as a disturbance in his brain, induced in part by withdrawal from alcohol and concurrent with the use of drugs, such as halcion, prescribed as anti-depressants. <br /> <br />His depression began when he was 60 and, after hospitalization, he indicates that he overcame the depression. <br /> <br />Styron writes about other artists and authors who have experienced clinical depression (as opposed to non-clinical depression, which would be less serious, supposedly).   <br /> <br />He is convinced that his depression, and that of other artists, originates internally, with disturbances of the brain biochemistry.  This is the general opinion of the medical profession at this time.  What we don't know, from this book anyway, is how much his drinking and prescribed drug use affected the nature and onset of his depression.   <br /> <br />For that perspective, we would have to read a memoir of someone who experienced clinical depression without ever having had a drinking problem and without having used prescribed or non-prescribed drugs. <br /> <br />Styron otherwise does not cite his environment as a contributory factor, except to say that he was depressed by turning 60, by a disappointment about his career achievements at that point, and by the stress of having to fly to Paris to receive an award. <br /> <br />His \\"clinical\\" memoir is therefore interesting, but limited in perspective.  Maybe it should be combined with some other such memoirs so readers can have a more rounded idea of what clinical depression is all about.  Diximus.	2004-10-11

It is definitely \\"didactic,\\" in that there is much conceptualization and little action.  Some would call it \\"preachy,\\" as some have done here on this website. <br /> <br />It is preachy, but it's still far more interesting than most tracts we read about homeless people published by academics or by the government. <br /> <br />I think Grisham has performed a real service for the reading public by using his story-telling talent to help us understand the topics of homelessness, big law firms and big-money lawyers, and about the peculiar nature of our nation's capital, demographically and economically. <br /> <br />Grisham tells a story, but he doesn't leave out the details, some abstruse details that we would never bother to read in a pamphlet on homelessness or on tort law.  Torts for dead children amounting on the average to $50,000 throughout the country?  This is both amazing and true.  <br /> <br />This book is actually easy reading, even though the action is slow.  I recommend it.  Diximus.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-09

On the other hand, if read with an open mind, there is much to learn. <br /> <br />Did I know what a Stealth bomber was?  No, I didn't, but now I do, thanks to this book.  I also learned a little, as much as I could digest with my limited experience, about the flight controls in such a plane, altitude differentials, the effect of weather conditions, and such.  It was an educational experience, in that respect. <br /> <br />The plot was a little dated, in that the KGB was still trying to pull this thing off, hijacking the bomber and recruiting operatives from disgruntled (or puzzy whupped?) citizens of the U.S. <br /> <br />Cuba going to war with the U.S.?  The U.S. bombing Cuba?  These were more pieces of the plot that lacked a little in credibility, but then who knows?   <br /> <br />Another thing that bothers me about all these military-oriented novels, or most of them anyway, is the jumping around among what seems like too many protagonists.  It's really hard to keep track of all the people.  Maybe these authors could write in the first person sometimes, so that we slow people without military experience could \\"get with the program\\" a little better.  Diximus.	2004-10-07

Someone on the jacket said the book is a cross between Franz Kafka and Ruth Rendell.  I'd say, Woody Allen with American Psycho and the vigilante vengeance of the movie, Taxi Driver.  And don't forget Robert Glover's classic, \\"$100 Misunderstanding.\\"  This book has elements from all these, and more. <br /> <br />The protagonist is a Jewish, Allen-esque schmuck, in the beginning of the book.  He does a \\"metamorphosis\\" (Kafkaesque?) by the end of the book.   <br /> <br />He wants to do right, but he falls to \\"Salome\\" (she turns out to be an Hispanic female \\"whore\\" scamming as a business person....and then gets smashed by, guess who?  A black Hispanic.   <br /> <br />Is all this interethnic fighting actually politically correct? Well, no, but don't worry, the schmuck murders the \\"spic\\" in the end, and guess what else?  He gets away with murder!  <br /> <br />Anyone who has ever been threatened, mugged, or worse, in an inner city neighborhood can identify with the schmuck.  Anyone who has been institutionalized can identify with Raul Vasquez, well, kind of.  He does own a bar, or better said, a \\"dive,\\" so that makes him a member of the propertied class, not exactly a homeless bum.  Mr. Vasquez does seem kind of grotesque in his \\"scamming\\" behavior and blackmail scheme, but yes, I've known people like him, too, and they can be quite scary. <br /> <br />Had it been me, I would never have paid anything, regardless of people's feelings.  But then I'm not earning what this advertising executive was making, either.  Also, I'm a cheapskate.  Charles seems to be pretty generous.     <br /> <br />The glimpse into the world of a New York advertising agency was also informative.  It reminded me a little of Grisham's law firms, albeit at a much lower level, but still with the pyramid of authority and the kowtowing to the alpha males (or females, as the case may be).   <br /> <br />Charles's daughter is diabetic and needs dialysis.  He does pay for these out of his earnings, and so we may admire him for his \\"heart\\" and love for his daughter (and wife) even though he slips and almost ends up in jail himself. <br /> <br />I think you'll enjoy this book, but it will make you uncomfortable, and that's part of the fun.

There's no question there was an anti-Arab/Muslim bias in this book, but what's so odd about that?  Americans want their American heroes to win.  Arabs and many non-American Muslims want their own people or people of their faith to win.  Isn't this a survival instinct of some kind?   <br /> <br />Actually, I'm one of the former, the Americans who want their boys and girls to win the hop-scotch match, or whatever it is.   <br /> <br />It would have scared me immensely if this Marc Gabriel fellow had succeeded, but it might have been an interesting change in the usual ending to a novel that endeavors to appeal to Americans.  Kind of a \\"noire\\" turn of events, perhaps?   <br /> <br />If they'd translate it into English (I'm still at the primary grade level in my Arabic), though, I'd be happy to read a book from the latter group.  Not a Rushdie topic, I assume? <br /> <br />I liked the dips into European and Arabic language that Reich makes throughout this book.  It gives the story a cosmopolitan feel.   <br /> <br />But the ending was just a little abrupt, and maybe not all that credible.  Wish it were Bin Laden struck by the missile instead of Marc Gabriel?  I do, in a way, because I'm afraid of the man (Bin Laden).  Of course, if he'd mellow out a little, that would be great, too.   <br /> <br />Is Jihad compatible with being mellow?  Good question.  This book will make you think about such things, and you will learn.  Diximus.	2004-10-07

Reminds me of the hatred of some fundamentalist Muslims toward the U.S. <br /> <br />But hey, how about those computer-controlled subs of the Japanese?  Pretty good idea?  There were a lot of good ideas here, and much to learn for novices like me.  The story line does jump around a lot, making it a little hard to keep up with who's who in the sub world, but I've read much worse.  For the most part, this author keeps things together, at least by segregating the crews by their respective subs. <br /> <br />One thing that bothered me, and also scared me, was how much further advanced the Japanese subs were than ours.  And, that considered, why would Pacino literally sacrifice most of his sub force, and some carriers, knowing that the Japanese could deflect our torpedoes and even take a few hits without going down?  That part seemed a little far-fetched.   <br /> <br />I really liked the idea of a female president.  It seems like a gimmick now but it's coming, and the sooner the better.  Diximus.	2004-10-07

Of course, Bishop was writing before Connelly and was an actual cop at one time.  Michael is a journalist who knows a lot about the cop business.  Bishop apparently used Joseph Wambaugh as a role model, but I don't know that he measures up to that standard, either.   <br /> <br />The fall guy, the Italian-surnamed sergeant everyone laughs at, except Calico's ex-wife (who appears to be using him to \\"get back\\") reminded me of the fall guys in Mash.  In fact, most of the characters are pretty cardboard-thin, and, for that matter, so is the plot. <br /> <br />The things that happen here are sensationalized, but not that interesting.  We know the hero, Mr. Calico, is going to come out on top in the end, while the bad guys of course predictably lose in the \\"macho\\" face off.  His half-Japanese partner, a female, is probably the most interesting, but we learn precious little about her, only that her father wanted her to follow a traditional path. <br /> <br />The \\"run\\" to Las Vegas is mildly interesting, if you have done that route.  Route 66, you know, except in the opposite direction and then a little to the northeast.  But his opponents in this sillly race are also silly people: their egos are their gods, so it seems for all of them in this book.   <br /> <br />Anyway, I read the book.  It's not boring, exactly, but you won't learn a whole lot here about Los Angeles cops, Los Angeles, or people in general.  Read Connelly instead if you want all that.  Diximus.	2004-10-06

Kim's whole life was astonishing, but especially the abuse at the hands of her adoptive parents and her ex-husband.  These were Christians?  This may go to show how \\"fundamental\\" doctrines can twist around the ideas of Christ.  The word took precedence over the spirit in these folks, according to Kim.  It's hard to believe that her ex-husband claimed to be a Christian at all, but I guess in some corners of these United States there are such twisted minds. <br /> <br />Some of Kim's introspection was not that interesting, and the poetry was maybe a nice touch, but it didn't touch me much.  But there was something uniquely different in Kim's life journey, and I learned a lot from that special quality.  Diximus.	2004-09-20

I cannot believe that this book was a New York Times bestseller.   <br /> <br />Is this what readers have come to?  And \\"writers\\"? <br /> <br />You will learn nothing from this book.

Well, that is not ours to know (it's on a need to know basis, as they say, and you don't' need to know).  There is not one jot or one tittle of local color in this book.  The word \\"Ohio\\" is only mentioned once.  This could be \\"anywhere\\" Ohio, but it couldn't be \\"anywhere\\" USA, because in most parts of the country something happens.

It's a paperback.  Does that say something about its value?  Well, I don't know who would pay that much for it....I found my copy in the trash, with mildewed pages and slightly waterlogged.  You can have it for the cost of shipping. <br /> <br />Judging from her works listed on this website, this author looks like she has made quite a writing career by remarking on the Tao.  In this book, she recites a verse or two of Lao Tse's work, and then gives examples from among her friends and acquaintances.  She gives personal exercises and \\"affirmations,\\" or self-statements.  To me, all of these were almost totally worthless.  It's not like they were new to me: they weren't.  Everything seemed like recycled garbage, and maybe that's her point, to recycle garbage. <br /> <br />The Tao itself is a great book, that's understood.  What Dreher does to it here is not great.  However, her book is not without some value.  It will make you think, but I think if you had just read the Tao itself you would get the same value.  No need for her quite pedestrian and quite unnecessary commentary.  This is not like some of the other Tao commentaries I have read, which I have enjoyed.   <br /> <br />I will say this: Diane Dreher, the way she comes out in this book, is one of those hippy-types who has forged a career for herself as a kind of flower child capitalist.

This 27 fellow, he's a murderer for sure, but his role in America is not believable.   <br /> <br />Do you like retribution books?  Where the so-called hero (who gets the girl, or at least one of them) shows all the bad guys, and I mean all of them, just who's boss?  Then you'll love this book.  It's one big retribution fantasy.  Like the \\"hero\\" says, and he's quoting an Irish proverb supposedly, \\"Forgive, but get even first.\\"  Wow!  What good advice!  Good for Mafioso, terrorists, gang members, and abused spouses.   <br /> <br />Who else wants on the retribution band wagon?  Sidney Sheldon may, I guess, though I've not read his books.  He liked this book, according to his blurb on the jacket, so I think he likes, and I guess he writes, similar \\"manly\\" retribution novels.  Probably the authors who practice this genre think it's manly to kill the evil anti-hero.  Maybe it is, but I've never tried it, so I wouldn't know.  As far as reading about it, it's a total bore.     <br /> <br />But...on the positive side, meriting a two, Diehl does weave in a lot of history, from Roosevelt to Hitler to J. Edgar Hoover to John Dillinger and the whole scene of the world in the 1930s, and Germany's pain during that time, and the German prisoner camps.  In this, he does a good job.

This book is one of the sleepers of all time.  No one has even bothered to review it here, but it's definitely a page turner.<br /><br />Yes, it's about 20 years old, out of print, and has to do with the Cold War era.  There's much about post-war Germany, but everything is just taut with excitement and tension.  This author knows how to paint the characters, and he does everyone, the protagonist (a hired killer), his victims, even the hit man's uncle, a shadowy abettor who lives on a farm in Maryland.<br /><br />Barclay's writing reminded me a little of Frederick Forsythe, succinct, to the point, the perfect balance between moving the plot and maintaining the suspense.  And something many crime novels lack: a believable and rational ending.<br /><br />The book is not quite a romance, it won't warm the cockles of your heart.  Barclay does raw sex quite well, and what's maybe unique or at least unusual, he does same sex well.  This comes about when Dartley, our hero, has to find a man who looks like him to take his place for a while.  I guess he figured the best way was to find a gay man, and the adventure is very amusing.<br /><br />Dartley is almost more European than American, compared to, for example, Lawrence Block's \\"Hit Man.\\"  He seems to be kind of Barclay's idea of what a tough American should be.  In Barclay's mind, which he imparts to us, Dartley is a perfectly normal psychopath, well, if there could be such a thing.  He kills without second thought, and does so carefully, always considering his own survival.  Still, he's a psychopath.  Well, he has to be, doesn't he?  Here's a fellow whose so-called collateral damage runs to young lovers (but not children, at least not in this book).<br /><br />So I urge you, if you like the idea of following a psychopathic killer into the darkest dens of iniquity, from Germany to West Virginia, spend the penny and get this book.

I read \\"The Brethren,\\" a later work by Grisham, and found it interesting.  \\"The Firm\\" is a bore.  It's a \\"reverse sting\\" kind of thing, but there's no tension or real struggle here. <br /> <br />Why?  Because it's all about the hero and heroine, and the other guys, mostly bad guys, are just cardboard nobodies.  You've heard of the Keystone Kops?  These guys are funnier in their ineptitude.  It reminded me of a Mel Brooks comedy the way the Mafioso and the FBI keep stepping on each other's feet. Meanwhile brilliant Mitch, his brilliant brother (speaks how many languages that he learned in prison?), and his brilliant wife (suckers one of the dumb lawyers into spilling the beans), slip off into the night on a little boat. <br /> <br />You'll waste a lot of time reading this book.  I didn't see the movie, so can't compare there, but here's the bottom line: Mitch's opposition is no threat to him because they are all so utterly inept.  You know he's going to make it, no problem.  There's no tension built up. <br /> <br />On the positive side, for those interested in local scenary, maybe the settings in Memphis and the Cayman Islands would be of interest.   <br /> <br />I noticed that Grisham presented a theme in both \\"The Brethren\\" and in this book: sailing off into the sunset, never a fixed abode, just living on the boat and moving on when ready.  You think he's doing this now?  Or has done it?   <br /> <br />Diximus.	2004-08-09

I'm not into romances, so I was pleasantly surprised here: it's not what I would think of as romantic, but it was interesting.  <br />  <br /> What I found most interesting was how easy Delia found it to leave her family. There seemed to be a significant age gap, maybe fifteen years, between her and her doctor husband, so although it was never made explicit by the author, I think she was just tired of this &quot;old man.&quot; She did mention his looking and acting more aged. And he himself says he never had the &quot;bedside manner&quot; his father-in-law had. <br />  <br /> Oh, that's another thing: Delia's father was a doctor, too. Are doctors known for being good lovers? Or being paternalistic? I think she feels Dr. Grinstead, her husband, is patronizing her. This is never resolved by the end of the story: she feels sorry for him, and a kind of sentimental or nostalgic remembrance of how he once was, but I don't think she loves him passionately or (can we say it?) sexually. <br />  <br /> And I don't know if she'll ever find what she wants. She treats all her men, and her &quot;boys&quot; about the same. She presents as a kind and nurturing, but &quot;dingy&quot; woman, just following her nose, always trying to be helpful but never really knowing what she wants or doesn't want. <br />  <br /> So, the story is interesting, and thankfully not romantic. It gives you a lot to think about in your own life, since everybody should be able to relate in one way or another to the characters: the jilted older husband, the jilted younger husband, the jilted teenage groom, the jilting teenage bride, the older couple, Nat and Binkey, with a young baby, the vengeful and resentful ex-wife (the former Mrs. Joel, who resents her father, Nat, starting all over again &quot;at his age&quot;), her needy and unmothered son, the innocent bystanders, the go-betweens, the walk-ons like Courtenay's caller, and, last but not least, the protagonist herself.

I think it's the minimalist aspect, the little microcosm of the real world that prisoners live in. That's why I was hooked after reading the first chapter of this book, and sped through it after that. <br />  <br /> I think the balance of tension is just right in this novel. There is very little violence, only Trevor's murder, but the threat of violence (from the CIA) is always there, right until the end. I kept thinking agent Argrow, the CIA operative, was going to do poor Mr. Yarber right in his restaurant chair in Monte Carlo, but he didn't.  <br />  <br /> What is really kind of funny, and sad, and reflective of our country and our times, is that the presidential candidate, and especially his sponsors, are so afraid of publicity about his possible same-sex preferences.  <br />  <br /> Funny, too, is that there are no women, to speak of, throughout this novel, it's a man's thing, so to speak. Each of the brethren was or is married, poor Trevor does have a mother and aunt who come to claim his remains, and Lake's &quot;Jayne&quot; seems like the kind of accommodating woman a lot of men would like. But these few have very minor roles. None of the CIA people are women, none of the prison personnel, nothing. I didn't mind, in fact, I would say it did reflect reality. As James Brown said (not trying to start an argument here, just noting it): &quot;It's a man's world (but it wouldn't be nothing without a woman or a girl).&quot; I'm glad it was James Brown said it and not me. It sounds kind of incorrect somehow, today in 2004. <br />  <br /> This novel's so-called denouement was a little mundane, as other reviewers have noted, but that, too, is realistic. Drama is far rarer in the real world than in most novels. Diximus. <br />  <br />	2004-07-26

The characters are shallow and uninteresting.  They can't seem to see beyond their own desires.  Spirituality?  Forget it.  The few children in the book are shuffled off to live with the poor losers, like Kris's ex-wife.<br />Yes, I finished the book.  It was not difficult reading, with lots of dialogue and short chapters.  But it was essentially boring.  Sure, it was prurient, lots of sex, and a bad guy (Marcus Citroen) who was about as stereotypical as you can possibly imagine.  Marcus didn't seem to have an altruistic bone in his body.<br />The fools that were trying to rip him off got caught.  Know why?  Because the manager of the catering service at Citroen's party, a woman, \\"fell in love\\" with the ex-con wannabe thief.  Even this catering manager was absorbed by her carnal desire, at what seemed like the drop of a hat.  She's going to leave her post and go hunting around for this loser, well, he was a good looking loser, I guess.<br />No matter how much carnal desire there is in Hollywood, people do have limits, don't they?  But not here in this novel.  Maybe that's why some people liked the book so much.  It goes all the way: all the way to stupidity and inanity.<br />Collins's constant dwelling on her men's obsession with female breasts was and is disturbing, to me.  The chief guard at Citroen's party is just so bowled over by one woman's large breasts, he just forgets everything for a little instant action.  Well, there may be men like that, who just lose all track of their jobs and everything else because of large breasts, but it seemed pretty shallow to me.<br />The plot is generally shallow.  It goes nowhere.  The three protagonists don't make up for one solid one, but none of three was interesting, just narcissistic.  Is that the real Hollywood?  Or just a fictional \\"device\\" to titillate readers?<br />Plow through this book if you like cheap thrills.  Nobody's going to remember it in a few years.  Diximus.y's going to remember it in a few years.  Diximus.	2004-07-19

This guy has the constitution of a bulldog.  <br />He never quits, never says &quot;die,&quot; and knows when to give in to the powers that be.  You'll speed through the book like he does through the murder case, jumping from one episode to the next.  This is a great book for insomniacs or those who &quot;only stand and wait,&quot; a thing I do a lot.<br />Only one thing to note, how at the final climax, Harry gets lost in South Central and runs into a mob of rioters, who bodily unload the &quot;shooter,&quot; a cop, from the backseat of Harry's car (where the man's been handcuffed).  Chastain, the personage in question, deserves what he gets, of course.  He started the riot by shooting a popular black lawyer.<br />But why can't Harry find his way around South Central?  All of the main streets are perpendicular.  This book's riot is close to where the 1992 &quot;flashpoint&quot; was, Florence and Normandie.  This riot is just a little further south, being near Florence and Manchester (86th).  <br />Anyway, living in South Central, as I do, I enjoyed his little jaunt there, but reading about how they did Chastain reminded me a little of what happened recently in Iraq.

It's nice that authors can write about aging protagonists as they themselves pass through the decades.  <br />Apparently, movie actors and other entertainers have a harder time with this transition, because so much depends upon their appearance.  We see authors only on the book jackets, usually, but some writers, like Janet Evanovich, decide to leave their protagonists at one age only.  <br />I think it's more realistic the way Connolly is doing it with Harry Bosch.  Harry's  a lot mellower now that he's retired, but he's still a bulldog about his mission in life, which has something to do with sticking up for the under &quot;bull&quot; dog.  <br />You'll like this book, if you have these same preferences.

For that reason, it takes on a very personal aspect that some of the other Bosch books don't have.  Harry's personal foibles, his mistakes and his lost love make him a bit easier to relate to.  He's fallible, but he doesn't fail.  He's outside the loop now, but he still solves the mystery.  Moreso than usual, Connelly grabs you by the collar and won't let you go until the end.  This is the kind of book you want while you're waiting to serve jury duty or get on a delayed airplane flight.  Diximus.	2004-07-07

The first cassette was defective and had been discarded by the library.  So, I read the first half.  The hardbound version is really nicely printed, with big print and big margins.  This was my first experience with Ms. Truman.  Guess what.  I didn't even know she was Harry's daughter!    Truman did a good job of joining the Columbus-Las Casas angle with the mystery story.  Some of the library people didn't really seem to have much character, like Sue and Consuela.  Walter Munsch, one of the bad guys, was a gas.  Tell me: Are you going to walk around a Mexican brothel with a couple of thousand $ cash in your pocket?  Munsch did.  No wonder his life span was short.  How did he even live that long?    I had a hard time empathizing with Dolores, who fell in love with Michelle Paul and then murdered him.  If Paul was such a  jerk, and everyone else thought so, how could she have loved him?  Well, I guess it didn't last, the love, that is.      Does David Driscoll get off scot free, then?  It's not really clear.      Anyway, Margaret Truman is definitely worth trying out.  I have another one I'm going to start soon.  Probably take only a day or two to finish it, because she's easy reading.  Diximus.	2004-06-29

It starts off slowly, like a typical romance, but it sure picks up at the end.  If this is so-called &quot;historical romance,&quot; it's not at all what I expected.  The people do talk a bit funny compared to our language today, but that adds to the authenticity.<br />Anne has a lot of moxie, going after the King like she does, and later gossiping about his little thing.  What did she expect?  You can't talk about a guy like that and expect to get off scot free, can you?  <br />Well, she plays and she pays.  It's sad toward the end, especially when she aborts the little boy (not purposely) and then is escorted to the Tower, her female enemies hounding her along the way.  Talk about getting shafted.  But she does recover and gain some dignity at the end.  <br />Her Uncle Norfolk must have been a real evil character.  Thomas Cromwell was righteously evil and here's one book where the bad guys come out on top, or so it seems.  <br />I did not know the story of Anne and Henry before reading this book, and it is just so bitter sweet, I want to read other books.

It offers interesting characters with interesting quirks and interesting biographical stories, for the most part.  <br />As I read the book, I looked forward each day to picking the book up to read, and basically that's what a &quot;good&quot; book is all about (wouldn't you agree?), keeping the reader interested, wanting to find out what happens next, like an intriguing &quot;soap opera&quot; (I don't watch them, so maybe Collins is a substitute for that TV storytelling....and she works fine as a substitute....better, I'd say).  <br />The only criticism I would make is about the abrupt and somewhat unbelievable ending of this book.  Yes, I know, this is the beginning of a series, but check this out.  You are a long-time, experienced gangster (Enzio Bonnatti), already an old man, and you want to &quot;hit&quot; two rivals: Do you send a timid, ineffectual son to kill his own father and sister?  No, you send a professional.  <br />Now, the hit fails (everyone but Bonnatti seems to see the failure coming) and one of the intended victims (Lucky) shows up at your home, which is guarded by whom?  One overweight, incompetent lout (&quot;Big Victor&quot;)?  Just one fat thug?  (Russo doesn't count, because he's out picking up the wannabe movie producer.)  I don't think so.  Let's have a team of bad guys here, please.  Now, does the lout frisk the intruder?  No again.  Instead, you, the old mobster who knows he has to be careful all the time meets the intruder in his own bedroom and, well, the rest is &quot;history.&quot;  Jackie's history.<br />But the rest of the book works better than this implausible ending.  One more minor complaint.  Why is it that Ms. Collins always has her men interested in the upper portion of the female anatomy, and not the bottom portion?  She seems not to realize that not all men areinterested in the female upper anatomy, as much as they are the lower anatomy.  No men in this book have these different tendencies.  They're all &quot;upper anatomy&quot; men.  A shame for those of us like the lower half better, poor sniveling ingrates that we are.<br />Why is it that I kept imagining most of this book taking place in Los Angeles/Hollywood?  I know the blackout was in New York, but I kept seeing L.A.  There are some references to Bel Air and other parts of L.A., but most of the action is in New York.  Can you tell I'm not a New York person?  I can.  Diximus.	2004-06-17

Someone trying to sell something, maybe?  If you're not selling anything overtly, this book will not be of interest.  I say overtly because, as someone once pointed out, we're all selling something, but we need not do so overtly or manifestly.  But by our behavior.  Actions and words and all.  This book, and others like it, all have us looking outward for gratification, basically from other people, people &quot;in the room.&quot;  &quot;In the room&quot; can be a metaphor for the &quot;in crowd.&quot;  Do you want in with the in crowd?  Maybe you'll learn some tools from this book.  Then again, you might do better looking inward at yourself.  Listen to one of the great modern inward-seekers, Vernon Howard (excuse the gender specificity, it's an old book): &quot;A man owes nothing to any other human being on earth except to be himself, but since few see this, most men stagger under the burdensome debt of artificial behavior.  It is a tragic illusion that we can do anything for others before we have done something for ourselves.&quot;  The writer of &quot;How to work a room&quot; is essentially focusing on how to improve your artificial behavior.

It's not easy reading.  <br />For me, it was like stuffing unwanted food down the throat.  I had to take it real slowly, a few pages at a time.  <br />Nelson et al. do a good job of martialing the legal cases related to abortion, death and dying, transplanted organs, artificial inseminations, and such.  <br />The &quot;Christian&quot; perspective seems to stand out most in the final chapter, when the authors discuss how medical treatment and care has become absorbed into the &quot;free market,&quot; and why it possibly should be taken out of that sphere and rendered as a &quot;right&quot; for all citizens.  This sounded pretty good to an individual lacking medical insurance.  But the authors also delineate precisely how such efforts have failed in the past and are unlikely to soon overcome the inertia built into the profit-system of medical care.  <br />Too bad for those of us on the receiving end.  Anyone want to try a curandero instead?  Or how about Christian Science, what Harold Bloom called America's &quot;self-help&quot; application to religion.  It would be a lot cheaper.

What do you do?  You write a romance and then plop down right on top of the romance &quot;a crazy person,&quot; a control freak who is strong and intelligent but more than a little sick: his name is Stark, but he's masquerading as Justin Brady, a simpleton.  No matter, he can't fool Mr. Hero, that is, Nick the FBI Guy.  Nick is all-around alpha-male what-every-woman wants, so how can he lose?  You see the problem here?  We all know what's going to happen: Down goes Stark, up goes Nick, he gets the girl (whoops, woman) in the end.  Ever heard that one before?  <br />On the good side, the book will keep you occupied and the paperback copy has a nice type font with space between the lines, making it easy to read.  Lots of conversation.  But way too much &quot;kitchen and bedroom&quot; talk, for me, but for romance lovers, of course not.<br />Jules Wesson is the only character who doesn't follow a formula: Jules, the unliked FBI Guy in Charge (&quot;jerk&quot;), does a good deed at the end and never gets his comeuppance, at least not in this book.<br />Which brings to mind another problem: Where did Stark come from?  Obviously, he has a past history, but it's only alluded to in this book and never really explained.  Something about Nick shooting Stark's wife, who was trying to kidnap a child?  Wow!  There must be a prequel, but the book cover never mentioned it.  <br />Well, you don't absolutely need the prequel, but I still say Stark was a little too crazy to be believable.

I agree with that observation, and while I was reading the story I was certain people today would notice that point: Maybe in 1968 (the publication date), people didn't notice?<br />Some of the stories seemed like &quot;starter&quot; stories, something a &quot;wannabe&quot; writer might write.

What if an anti-aging concoction was discovered and the population explosion covered the earth with people of all ages (Tomorrow etc.)?  These kinds of questions are certainly relevant today, and that may be one measure of their worth: longevity.  <br />I could not read this book like a novel, with growing interest as the plot unfolds.  For me, it was the type of book one would have to put aside from time to time, to kind of &quot;digest&quot; the contents, before reading more.

A logical question would be, &quot;Why would a person who detests the romance genre listen to this audiobook?&quot;  To expand my mind?  <br />I wouldn't read a romance, but I found this tape thrown out by a local library, so why not listen?  <br />Things seem so mundane and non-different in Promise, Texas, I really didn't expect much to happen.  And it didn't.  One positive thing, it is easier to keep track of the characters here than in some other audiobooks.  <br />The reader does a good job with the voices, though Amy's &quot;protector&quot; Dovie tends to sound like an old woman, real old.  <br />Routine happenings here, nothing unusual or even remarkable: for example, Lyle Whitehouse, the so-called cow-hand, approaching Amy with &quot;lust in his heart&quot; (and being what Amy found to be &quot;unmannerly&quot;) and then having to fight the upright pastor, Wade (whose heart is, of course, pure).  Ever heard or seen that one before?  If you haven't, you've missed many an &quot;oater.&quot;  <br />In fact, the whole plot, such as it is, reminds me of an old western, but even duller.

The only thing I really didn't understand was the actual murder itself and the motive: in a way, it seems that Wilson forced that part to give a connection to the two threads of the book, post-WW2 Portugal and Portugal today.  <br />It must be really hard for authors to make everything fall into place in the end, because very few can do it.  <br />But who needs all that?

Also, this is the first Allingham book I have read, so the characters were all new to me.<br />That said, I found the book worthwhile, with respect to learning new things, about London, about the way people spoke in that day and age and in that locale, and about their customs (still driving a horse-drawn hearse, for example), customs which seem pretty unusual today.  The book is set in post-World War II years, so it's about concurrent with the publication date.<br />If you like literary references, you'll find a few here.  The character action is muted, compared to today's novels, and only really picks up at the end, when there's a short rise to the denouement and a quick rush to the end.  Instead of performing many actions, the characters do a lot of talking, and that's when you get your lesson in Briticisms and cockney accents.<br />For a book written in 1949, this one holds up relatively well, even for readers like me, used to reading contemporary crime fiction (as opposed to mysteries).

Sure, there are some implausibilities, but what novel is totally realistic?<br />What I liked most was how Connelly was able to so capably weave the crime story in with the science story.  I learned a lot about nanotechnology, and it was totally palatable, because that story is interwoven perfectly with the seedy underworld story.  This is storytelling at its best: it's like taking candy-coated medicine.  You know it's good for you (to learn something), but you need that little extra push to actually swallow it (the suspense, the sex, whatever).<br />What I found implausible was Henry's upbringing.  He seems to have hated his stepfather, never knew his real father well, and totally refused to speak to his own mother.  Now how is this kind of dysfunctional kid going to go to Stanford (where he gets in even more trouble), and then become one of the most prominent \\"emerging technology\\" chemists in the country?<br />Well, it could happen, but not likely.  Still, why dwell on these inconsistencies?  The point is, this book will give you something intriguing to do in your spare time, unless, of course, you're stuck on Bosch.<br />Diximus.	2004-04-27

I learned how life might have been like near Bakersfield, California, during the Depression.  That was interesting, even though things did seem a little slow.  Probably, that's exactly how it was, slow, and if you like action, this audio book will seem real slow, too.<br />But interesting.  One thing you can avoid, making it probably more like the movie that some reviewers seemed to like, is that the quilting instructions are minimized on the tape.  You can just kind of sleep through those.  I did, because I couldn't make heads nor tails of them.  If quilts had something to do with Grecian art, I'd have to say, &quot;it was all Greek to me,&quot; but they don't, so.....it's all Grasse to me.<br />The only thing, I think, this analogy thing can be a crutch for an author (some reviewers called it a metaphor, I'm not choicy).<br />Talk about a quilt, talk about a life.  Or vice versa.<br />In that sense, the story reminded me of the Legend of Bagger Vance, a golfer's version of the Bhagavad Gita.  It was one of the most boring things I had ever heard, and golf also ranks up there.  But it did make me think about the Gita (don't become attached to the results of your actions, or &quot;just do it&quot;).<br />The men in Whitney Otto's story seem pretty weak, by and large.  The white people seem pretty conflicted about race, and that's probably an accurate reflection of Bakersfield in the 1930s, if not today.<br />Diximus.	2004-04-27

I didn't know that more people died in the Dresden bombing than in Hiroshima.  Truman's speech, given verbatim in this book (supposedly, I didn't check) was very eye-opening.<br />So the value here, to me, was to learn a little history in a palatable and interesting story.  It's much better than trying to read it in one of those dull textbooks (whose authors should be ashamed and stop writing, or try to write like Mr. Vonnegut).  <br />By the way, what ever happened to Kurt's son, Mark, the one who wrote about recovering from schizophrenia?<br />Diximus.	2004-04-24

Well, with 187 reviews to date, just about every angle has already been touched upon by previous reviewers on this site.  <br />I'll only add one more possible angle: reflect on yourself by using this book.  Some others have hinted at this also.<br />Example: Many reviewers who disliked the book, or liked it only tepidly, felt it was &quot;racist.&quot;  Well, in PC terms, of course, it is just that.<br />But that's not the point.  The point is, &quot;You&quot; feel that way.  Or you don't.  This is how Vonnegut's use of the &quot;n&quot; word and the stereotypes affected you: you got a little hot about it, or you didn't appreciate it, or you did appreciate it, or you thought it was funny.  How did you react to that?<br />And how did you react to the author as character in a novel?  It rarely happens, but Vonnegut did it well, I think.  It never gets phony, but it points to phoniness, as a potential, in us and in our love of fiction.<br />That's how I felt.  How did you feel?  Diximus.	2004-04-19

The scenario of Player Piano is just a little unrealistic, when compared to today's reality: yes, computers seem to be taking over much of the work formerly done by humans (or other animals).  But, humans keep finding other things to do.  They seem always to stay one step ahead of the &quot;machines.&quot;  At least so far.  <br />Therefore, the world of Player Piano didn't really &quot;grab&quot; me.  I can't see it happening.  Oh, there is classism, as in this book, here in the good ol' US of A, but the system seems also to keep evolving, thus preventing the &quot;revolution&quot; that takes place in this book.  People complain widely about the &quot;trickle down&quot; theory, but there seems to be something to it.  <br />The women in this story are pretty sad.  You can tell they're from the 50s, when women, I suppose, seemed to lack original thought of any type.  Paul's wife, Anita, seems a prototype in this regard, same with Kroner's wife, &quot;Mom.&quot;  How many &quot;Moms&quot; have we known?<br />The idea of the Reeks and Wrecks, though, I think is workable.  It was workable, with the Civilian Conservation Corps, and now we have the Job Corps, state Conservation Corps, and such.  CETA was that type of program, but not all of the jobs were &quot;make work.&quot;  This just means that the government is the &quot;employer of last resort.&quot;  There's nothing wrong with that, it doesn't imply a ruling class of scientists and engineers, and it really has nothing to do with Marxism.  CETA or CCC jobs can satisfy a person just as much as other jobs, and from that job they certainly can move up, if they have the ability to do so.<br />Another point: Notice how the good ol' boys got together on an island and did competitive physical activities (with their wives at a separate location).  This also gives Vonnegut's time period away: pure 50s stuff.  Today, people don't compete so much one or two weeks a year, but they go to a gym and work individually in a non-competitive atmosphere.  Times have changed?  For the good, I'd say, otherwise, you get poor fools like this Shephard fella, who lives to compete (and seems to enjoy losing also....masochistic?).<br />Anyway, except for the date and time &quot;stamps&quot; on this novel, it still does hold up well today, and it's certainly intellectually stimulating, makes you think and take a position regarding &quot;encroaching&quot; technology, so-called &quot;technocrats,&quot; and, what should we call it, &quot;Neo Ludditism&quot; today.  This will probably be an ongoing conflict throughout human history, or at least for a long time, so Vonnegut touched an archetypal chord there, and his book may still be relevant in 3004, who knows?<BR>Diximus.	2004-04-14

I thought I was going to dislike it, because I'm not a romanticist and of the few things I've read in the romance genre, I derived little pleasure, much boredom.<br />This one was different.  Some of it may have been the drama that the reading puts into it.  It was read very well, sorry I don't have the man's name.  But there was some drama, and some emotional scenes, toward the end.<br />When Grace reconciles finally with thick-headed Ethan, when Ethan asks her will she let him be her daughter's (step) father, it is touching, even for a non-romantic.<br />The only thing a little out of whack was Ethan's belief that his mother's slovenliness would be hereditary.  At one point, he inventories hereditary factors, like weak hearts or hair color, but then he throws in something that was clearly a learned behavior, his mother's being very unmotherly.  Oh, some of it might be attributed to her hormone system or even a brain malfunction, but he clearly didn't have those problems.  Maybe he thought it was one of those generation-skipping disabilities?<br />Anyway, Ethan seemed to be confusing nature and nurture.  An introductory psychology course would have cleared up the matter for him long before he had to be &quot;wailed&quot; out by Grace, fed up with his intransigence.<br />I'm going to try other books by Nora Roberts, and also J.D.

Like when Walter's date, Sarah, guffaws at his boyish attempt to kiss her, \\"braying like she was at a Marx brothers' movie.\\"  Or something.  <br />Walter F. Starbuck's striking characteristic, to me, is his humility.  He seems to have no hidden pretenses about his role in the world, never forgets his humble origins, never takes others for granted or assumes he's superior to them.  He seems  generally to assume he's inferior.  Yes, he did make some mistakes, but they don't seem gargantuan (for example, he \\"ratted\\" on a one-time friend, mentioning during an investigative hearing that his friend had once been a member of the Communist party).<br />The narrative just keeps rolling until about the end, when poor Mrs. Jack Graham, Walter's first sexual experience, dies as a fantastically wealthy bag lady, in her tennis shoes, as it were, filled with a desultory 4,000 one dollar bills and her last will and testament (to distribute her corporate empire to the American people).  The ending just seems slightly abrupt.<br />But one important piece of philosophical advice may have been given by Walter, when he notes that, no matter what course he had taken in his life, it really wouldn't make any difference in a world (which is) just a small iota in an infinitely expanding universe.

This one seemed more interesting.  Maybe it's addictive.  Already I can see some repetition of themes between the two books, such as the plight of the teenage daughter.  But this actually makes sense, this repetition of themes, because it seems to reflect the industry itself: samo samo, very closely prescribed roles and behaviors, from the creative, kooky director (Mick) to the drugged-out actor (Aiden) to the adulterous but successful director (Richard) and so on.  Hollywood hasn't changed much over the years and so trite roles seem just right.  Collins obviously knows of what she writes, and that's nice for the reader, to know that there is some authenticity behind the author's words.  She paces this book real well, revealing a little of the main characters' backgrounds every so often, leaving Joey and Richard until the end almost, so there's always a new surprise around the corner.  The culmination of the story leaves something to be desired: a &quot;drop off the cliff,&quot; as it were, like Ms. Collins couldn't quite figure how to end everything.  She just does it all at once.  There are some other implausibilities, like Richard turning his life around (from homocide) to become a famous director, having learned the craft from a Mexican director who made him watch old movies.  If you could learn to direct by watching old movies.....well, it just doesn't seem plausible.  Anyway, on whole, this book will hold your interest.  It's not high brow literature, as another good fella pointed out on this website, but it helps to pass the time and, who knows?  Maybe we can even learn a little something.  Diximus.	2004-03-29

The hero is a teen, maybe around 14 or 15, as are his allies and enemies, except for one chief bad guy: Chuck E. Muckle, vice president of Mother Paula's Pancake Houses.  <br />The other adults who originally start on the pro-Mother Paula team eventually switch over to the pro-burrowing owl team, the one headed by the teens.  But this sorry Chuck E. Muckle just seems to have no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  In the epilogue, we learn that he is first demoted within, then let go from Mother Paula's.  He takes a \\"cruise director\\" job in Miami instead.  The poor guy had so few people skills, it's hard to see how he could possibly make it as a cruise director.<br />Anyway, it is kind of sad to see how the big corporation might have, in the past, tried to hide an Environmental Impact Report that showed a protected species on their property.  But I don't think this could actually happen today, at least not in California.  In California, the environmental watchdogs are very diligent and they usually do question EIRs and ask for further studies, and so forth.  Maybe in Florida, or other places where environmentalists may not be as active, a corporation could still hide an EIR from public view and get away with it.<br />Roy Eberhardt, the young hero, learns all about the EIR during his endeavor to protect the little owls.  Readers will, too, if they know nothing about these important requirements for all developments nowadays.  Putting down one Mother Paula's Pancake House (they already have 468, according to the book), is obviously no big deal.  The real battle comes when you have one team crying out for low- and middle-income housing, because of perverse shortages, and the other team crying out for environmental protection and slow growth.<br />This is what happens usually in Southern California.  Clearly, there's not always an either/or response.  It's a living issue, and this little book will you help to focus onthat issue in your own mind.  Diximus.	2004-03-08

Yes, the story's a little bumpy at times and there's a lot of \\"get back,\\" (not exactly a spiritual approach), but it will definitely hold your interest from page 1 to the last page.  <br />Here's what I especially liked: I thought the hitman, Mr. Gash, was a \\"stone gas\\" (that's kind of how he ended up), with his seersucker suit and Gerry and the Pacemaker boots.  It was great the way Hiassen let us into his personal life, even down to his dying thoughts.  His 911 tapes are pretty funny.  And the funniest one is the last one, based on his last (tongueless) call to 911.  And you've got to hand it to him (Mr. Gash), he did die with his boots on (but his pants off).<br />Some of the minor characters were a little more believable, but just as ornery, as some of the big players, like Governor Dick Artemus (with the shameful (rear)) and Palmer Stoat (with such a name, you just know he's going to have trouble) and Robert Clapley (who dies with his \\"dolls\\" on).  I liked the fellas at the safari ranch, even though they come to bad ends, too.  Palmer's \\"Republican\\" mistress was an interesting twist.  <br />This book will make you aware of the struggle between those who want to preserve nature and those who want to alter it.  Here, we see the preservationists as the good guys, but even though they \\"win\\" in this story, it's pretty clear they are fighting a \\"rearguard\\" type of action.  The nature of the existing system is such that constant alteration is to the short-term benefit of more people than preservation is.  Population pressures don't help much either.  <BR>This book represents a very entertaining way to get you to think about such issues.  Diximus.	2004-03-05

Well, there's Dr. Alan Gregory and his wife, Lauren, the protagonists sort of, but don't forget Emma, who is an intern under Laura in the Boulder (Colorado?) D.A.'s office, where Laura is a D.A.  Then there's the polices, Scott Malloy and a veteran whose name I can't recall.  Then there's Emma's private security, a guy who used to work for the Secret Service but ends up shot and run over by the villain, J.P. Morgan.  Heard that name somewhere before, have we?  J.P. Morgan is a financial partner with Ethan Hahn, an inventor who has found a way to transduce bodily movements into bits, which sounds something like EMR or tomography.  But anyway, Ethan gets a little carried away and wears the transducer while he's making love to Emma (it's a long story).  Then there's Raul Estevez and his wife, another shrink (like Gregory).  Did I leave anybody out?  Like I said, tedious and contrived.  What ever happened to creativity?  I don't mean dreaming up fantastic, totally improbable circumstances to drive a plot, but real inventiveness.  Well, that's not Stephen White's concern, I suppose.  And why should it be?

Since this book was published in the 1980s, much has changed.  The value of this book today is to provide perspective.  The book presents a snapshot of the same-sex movement then, which, when compared to a snapshot today, permits us a rough measure of change.  Altman is an Australian who spent much time in the United States and also Europe and other parts of the world, so his analysis does have breadth.  Altman attempts also to address same-sex issues among women, but he frequently confesses that he is not an expert in that area.  He includes a chapter about the phenomena of sado-masochism and pedophilia, and how they have become linked, erroneously he believes, with same-sex relationships.  There is also an interesting chapter on same-sex \\"culture,\\" going back to the beginnings of history.<BR>  <BR>Altman's reasoning does not always seem to be real tight and to the point.  He seems to wander around quite a bit with extraneous citations and data, not actually a scientific analysis but more of a journalistic argument.  This, however, makes the book more interesting reading than a dry treatise, and Altman is certainly not afraid to reference his own experiences, some of which are pretty funny.<br />This book may have some currency today for the perspective it provides on same-sex history.

It seemed too contrived, like the author had trouble creating a concise plot and had to draw so many unlikely connections to finally end the thing.<br />Further, there's not really any surprises, because \\"the last man standing\\" is just who you would expect it to be: the hero, the only one consistently referred to by his first name, \\"Web.\\"  The villains (the male villains, that is) are always identified by their last names or entire names (e.g., Nemo Strait, got that?)<br />On the other hand, until the last 50 pages or so, when the plot unravels in an orgy of violence and unlikely coincidences, it does make for interesting reading.  Web's psychiatric experience is different, and the insights into the operations of the FBI were interesting.<br />The goings-on of a horse farm were entirely uninteresting to me, but if you like horses, you may get a \\"kick\\" out of the fact that Web and his \\"sidekick\\" spend a lot of time on a horse farm.<br />What I learned was this: if you read Balducci, you'll got a lot of interesting detail and some character study, but a contrived plot that could be improved upon by a ten-year old.<br />By the way there's a prominent 10-year old character in this book.

There are some boring parts, as others noted, but what biography does not have some boring parts?  Here's what I found especially interesting:<br />Grant gives readers a good idea about how most of the chronicles he consulted were written from one perspective or another and thus tended to be sentimentally biased in one direction or another.  Grant points out significantly that as &quot;Westerners&quot; we have clung most closely to the &quot;Occidental&quot; version of matters, rather than anything leaning toward the other side, the &quot;Orient.&quot;  He points out consistently how ancient writers who disliked Cleopatra changed facts around to disparage her, while the opposite was true of those who liked her.<br />The point being, it seems, that you have to take your history with a grain of salt (just as we do the news from the various modern media).  Some reviewers seem to feel that Grant himself is slightly biased, in Cleopatra's favor, but as long as we're aware of it, we can perhaps discern the bias and read other viewpoints to get a well-rounded sense of what actually occurred.<br />The other interesting point was how many people, mostly men presumably, died during these ancient wars.  And how little their deaths accounted for anything.  In other words, life was a lot cheaper then than today.  In Cleopatra's time, only the top dogs had the sense of individual rights that most of us have today.  Is that progress?  <br />Grant's book, of course, is thoroughly documented for those wishing to do further investigation.<br />Diximus.	2004-02-17

He shows us clearly why these programs are political responses and not actually based in &quot;the truth&quot; of unemployment at all.  There are too few jobs available to help poor people with a band-aid approach.  Although he does not come out and say it, Lafer's implication is that the CETA program, public funding of jobs, was more to the point for poor people.  The government then acts as the employer of last resort.  He probably feels, and I agree, that it will come to that again soon, because corporate America is out to make a profit, not help the workers, and unions?  Well, they're shrinking and losing even the little say-so they did have, witness the grocery strike right now in Southern California.  So, eventually, probably sooner than later, there will be many idle people lingering and you know what the devil does with idle lingering people.  The only redeeming element of politics that we can find in Lafer's scathing analysis of Ronald Reagan and his ilk, is that what goes around comes around.  Politics goes in cycles.  CETA had its day, just as the New Deal did, and the War on Poverty.  Now we're in the thick of a backlash period, but it can't last.  That is, if it does last, it won't be the same old U.S. anymore, will it?  More like Unbrave New World?  Diximus.	2004-02-13

As others have pointed out on this website, he confused reinforcers with rewards.  <br />What's surprising is that he did this even after (apparently) reading through Skinner's books and even interviewing him.  Nevertheless, nobody will accuse Mr. (Dr.?) Kohn of being hard-hearted: He, at least, finds reinforcement in sticking up for the other viewpoint, making us humans feel important again.  Skinner probably knew in his heart and head that comparing humans to radishes (we are only here to carry and pass on genes) would not appeal to most people (punishing).  Yet, this is what biology has given us: this is our main purpose, the sound and fury notwithstanding.  <br />Alfie (What's it all about?) at least tries to prop up our little egos again, and some of us need that.  I found Skinner's viewpoint (in his interview with Alfie) to be close to the Buddhist viewpoint (no egos, no fear of death, et cetera).  It also reflects such viewpoints as expressed by biologists in their analyses of human moral systems.  Anyway, this book is still worth reading, if only for Skinner's interview in the appendix.

The \\"Fabulous Boulevard\\" is Wilshire Boulevard, named after Gaylord Wilshire.  As reported by Hancock, Gaylord Wilshire was an eccentric millionaire who also happened to be a Socialist and a newspaper publisher.  <br />How things have changed since 1949!  If you know Los Angeles today, this book will provide you with a very intriguing counterpoint, comparing today to how things were then.  <br />Hancock's writing style may seem a little stilted to today's readers.  In many cases, he seems a bit too jingoistic about Wilshire Boulevard.  But if you can wade through the quotations from old city hall meetings and legal documents, you will find some interesting information that is not widely available anywhere else.<br />The origins of MacArthur Park, once Westlake Park, are intriguing.  The sad part is that the city seemed to have such high hopes for this one-time swamp.  Alas, today it's reverted to its previous incarnation as a swamp.  Today, homeless folks sleep on the tennis courts that Ralph Hancock eulogized, being so nice to have close to the central city.<br />There's a chapter about Donald Douglas of Douglas Aircraft and the beginning of the aircraft industry in Los Angeles, but especially in Santa Monica.  What's not included, of course, is the later desuetude of the aircraft industry.<br />The historical perspective a reader gains from comparing today's Los Angeles with Hancock's Los Angeles of 1949 and earlier is helpful, because it shows, basically, how transitory urban life is.  Here today, gone tomorrow, or alternatively, not imagined yesterday, here today, that seems to be the dual theme of such a comparison between past and present.  <br />If you can get a hold of a copy of this book, do so.

That part was worth it.  The book is called Maridos de Hollywood.  In English, I wouldn't waste the time.  What's the point?  There is no point, unless it's Jackie Collins idea of entertainment, apparently shared by those who buy her books.  There are some long, drawn-out tales of parallel lives, but no very deep insights, only surface stuff, maybe what Ms. Collins believes Hollywood is like itself.  In this book, she writes some interspersing chapters, all in italics, about a female pyromaniac, who is abused by various males in her life and some females also.  When she gets pushed too far, she lights a match and it's &quot;hasta la vista, baby,&quot; to her antagonists.  This is the climax of the books: she lights up the big guy's yacht on New Year's Eve, and four deaths (and some supposed heroics) result.  But who is this mystery woman?  Unless I missed it in the Spanish version, we never find out.  So what's the point?  Just to keep you guessing, I guess.  The Spanish translation was interesting, since the translator took pains to literally translate idiomatic expressions.  I'm glad I read it for that reason, but for the content?  Forget it!

Another good thing about it is that we can look back and see how much things stay the same.

I'm not a Custer or Army or western Americana buff, but as many others have, I have been fascinated by this episode.  What I found in Sandoz's book, moreso than in others, is that my visual cortex seemed to be working better, based on the vivid descriptions.  I was able to picture the layout and scenery better than before, the visual imagery.  That said, Sandoz does have a somewhat peculiar style of writing, in this work.  Possibly, as someone else noted herein, it was ghost written based on her notes.

Sure, it raised my eyebrows a few times, like when this &quot;hero&quot; started to taste the tiger dookie, but it's all just a fantasy of the author's imagination, which is not really that imaginative.  I guess, if you really wanted to write an animal story, you would have to think of some &quot;outlandish&quot; (that is, no longer in the zoo or the wild)way to attract readers.  Martel seems to have done that, but I predict this book will be forgotten relatively quickly.  With the exceptions of the little &quot;startle&quot; incidents, like the tiger, Richard Parker, making a quick meal of another sea survivor, this book is more like a textbook than anything else.  Boring recitation after boring recitation about zoo life, Indian cooking and religion, and that's about it.  Yes, it will make you think, &quot;Well, what if I were caught in the middle of the ocean with a tiger on a small boat?&quot;  But is that going to hold your interest for long?  No, because it's too unlikely.  This is just like the Japanese boat company representatives say at the end of the book, and frankly, they're right.  The good thing about the book, if you are interested in zoos and Indian religion, then this is a slight step up from a textbook or college course in same, because there is a story, albeit slow and drudging.

New York scenery maybe, if you &quot;love New York.&quot;  <br />Maybe you identify with artistic genius, knowing that it could also cause what society defines as mental disease.  The hero of this book is that way: Give in to the mania because you have a genius for painting fine pictures.<br />But the most interesting character, to me, was Allen Broadhurst, the sociopath or psychopath who ends up with a big bruise on his skull: If Mr. (whoops, sorry, Doctor) Atkins had included more of this nut case, he might have sold more books.  He would have had his own version of Freddy Krueger and the other homicidal maniacs that the public today seems to love so much.<br />Maybe he has to be credited with holding on to his (psychiatric) integrity, by not giving in to the urge to highlight Allen Broadhurst.<br />This makes for a slow book.

It was difficult to identify with the protagonist (heroine?), Susie, and, for that matter, with any of the other characters.  <br />Yes, this is a terrible thing that happened to her, being murdered by a serial rapist/murderer.  This sorry fellow, the murderer, was apparently abused by his own mother: Does that explain the etiology of his behavior?  Well, in any case, he gets his due in the end: slain by a deadly icicle (I wouldn't kid about this).<br />But meanwhile, because the law can't catch the perpetrator, maybe, Susie is more or less in limbo, still watching her family, classmates, and the perpetrator, from somewhere above.  What she sees is, well, not that exciting.  Probably, this book would appeal more to sensitive people, in that it resembles poetry somewhat, a kind of dancing around to get the point across.<br />As for the metaphysics, the living on after death, returning to earth as a spirit and actually inhabiting another person's body, briefly, this should appeal to those who believe in an afterlife.  Yet, it's not exactly a Christian metaphysic, in this book.  The metaphysic seems to fall rather between the cracks of organized religions, and maybe could be described more as a \\"New Age\\" metaphysic.<br />It seems right, that a person who is murdered whose murderer is still running around loose should watch from above until he himself dies, by one means or another.  But is this really God's way?  Or the way of the Universe, whatever Force is out there behind it all?  It seems unlikely, because of all the senseless murders and other deaths that seem to go apparently unrequited.<br />Maybe the key word here is \\"apparently.\\"  Maybe, as in the Christian metaphysic, it all comes out in the wash, at the Second Coming.  But if not, well, I did finish the book: That's something, isn't it?      <br />Diximus.	2003-06-24

(Rhymes with Anonymous)	Yes...this book will definitely keep your interest, until the end...The only criticism is, can it possibly relate to real life?  Well, it does to an extent, but the protagonist, Hieronymous (Harry) Bosch, is so extraordinarily focused, and so outstandingly righteous, that it's hard to believe he's real.  Living in Los Angeles, this is a concern of mine, because Harry is with the LAPD.  All the flack he puts up with, because he's a loner, it makes us citizens kind of feel a little uneasy: The LAPD is like a large and legitimate Mafia, the way they spy on each other...or, on the other hand, they don't take the job seriously, like Mr. Bosch does...they have &quot;side jobs.&quot;  Great!  We have nothing to worry about!  Cops like Harry are a fable and the cops who get fat and would rather be selling real estate are the reality!  <br />Anyway, all that aside, there's an interesting quote, when Harry and his love interest, FBI agent Eleanor Wish, are conversing at one point.  She asks Harry has he heard what J. Edgar Hoover said about justice.  No, he says, but he probably said a lot.  &quot;He said justice is incidental to law and order.&quot;<BR>Is that Platonic, or what?  Nietzschean?  Hitlerian?  Well, anyway, it's cute.

Steve Allen is not afraid to discuss the problems with the Bible.  He especially made clear that Revelations (Apocalypse) is not really very clear.  I never did understand Revelations, but I thought maybe I was missing something, since Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins had made such a big deal with their &quot;Left Behind&quot; series.  Allen straightens all that out: basically, what he says, we really can't pay much attention to Revelations, because it really can't be understood, the author is really not known, and so forth.<br />Allen's basic approach is that God, as an omnipotent, omniscient power, could not have had much to do with the Bible, because the Bible has so many contradictions, errors, descriptions of revenge instigated by God or Yahweh.  Allen interprets the Bible literally in order to show how it really doesn't hold together.  <br />But I think, at least for me, Allen's whole book (I didn't read the first volume) tends to increase my faith in God, the omnipotent, omniscient One, that is.  I'll have to look a little closer at our current version (one of many) of the Bible.  Diximus.	2003-05-12

And wouldn't it be appropriate for such a man to quote Charles Darwin in building his little argument that all of us are here merely as minions to the economic forces?  So he does, as follows: &quot;It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change&quot; (page 60).<br />This Price Pritchett fella spends his writing time convincing us that our essence is found in what we contribute to the economy, and then his last sentence, the very last in this little book, reads as follows: &quot;And let's enjoy the ride.&quot;<br />But it can't be both ways.  If we endeavor to really enjoy ourselves, we may conflict with the purposes of the economy.  If we really dedicate ourselves to the economy, we may not particularly enjoy it.  Price Pritchett is talking out of two sides of his mouth.  And why shouldn't he?  Mammon is is his God, and Mammon has served him well.  He's trying to convince the rest of us that we should go along with Mammon's program.  I prefer the real God, myself: I don't know what or who that is, but I know what it ain't, and it ain't Mammon.<br />This little pamphlet does have some interesting statistics.

I know who Jim Garrison was (is?...is he still alive?), and who Clay Shaw was...Rita Mae Brown I've heard of...and a few others, but this mountain of people?  I guess you can tell, I'm not into the same sex movement...but shouldn't the book educate people like me?  <br />Well, it did, but very little.  I wanted to know, for example, why do people prefer the same sex?  Is it genetic, psychological, sociological, learned, what?  What is the difference between bisexual people and same sex people?  <br />These are the things I hoped to learn from Sears's book, but instead, just a total mismash of people, places and circumstances...that's what I found.

I felt like I was reading Lawrence Block's fantasies, which they clearly are.  \\"If I were a hit man, what would I do?\\"  Keller, the hit man, lives in New York City, like Block.  His comings and goings in various U.S. locales (mostly the mid-west it seems) bring to mind Lawrence Block traveling in these places, how he would react, the people he would meet.  A nice fantasy, but with one exception: Lawrence Block doesn't really murder people, but Keller does.<br />Keller is obviously a sociopath.  Essentially, this means he can murder and feel no remorse about it.  I'm pretty sure there are youngsters out there in the world who want to emulate Keller, but is it right to trivialize his conduct and make him appear an Everyday Guy?  Well, whether it's right or wrong is not the issue I guess, but what holds interest.  Or is it?<br />This attraction to criminals and murderers, which apparently is a long-standing love affair for humanity, definitely says something about we humans.  Is it any wonder we need God?  Without a higher power, we'd really be at the edge of extinction, because, who else would keep us all from trying to be little Kellers, little \\"wanna be hit men\\" (and women?).  <br />Oh, that's right, this is a \\"men's\\" book: It's the men who idolize these killers and cool hit men, isn't it?  Keller's business associate Dot seems to be an exception, in that she also seems to vicariously enjoy his hits, but isn't that unusual for women, that is, to enjoy the idea of murder (and to benefit financially from it)?  I think most women would be a little more upset about Keller, and take less vicarious interest in him, than men.<br />So thank Heaven for little girls!

It's frightening as heck, that's for sure, but it's implausible.  <br />It seems that Ms. Butler was possibly trying to inject some metaphysical philosophy into the book by having her protagonist, Lauren Olamina (her surname is Yoruban, so we're told), keep chanting the refrain \\"God is change.\\"  But as her father-figure lover, Bankole (it's Yoruban), tells her: those are only words.  <br />I guess the idea was that in a frightful society, nobody could possibly remain a Christian, much less adhere to any other \\"traditional\\" religion.  <br />Bankole asks at one point: \\"Would Jesus be Christ if he were here today?\\"  Puleeez, don't let the Rapturists hear you talking like that!  <br />This book will frighten, anger, and depress, and to that extent, it certainly creates emotion, if, that is, you can finish it.  Don't try to read it in one sitting.  Have another book with a little lighter and happier tenor on hand to alternate from time to time.  <br />By the way, I live in South Central Los Angeles, and what Butler describes in this book is really not too far off from what we have in South Central, but without the pyromaniacs and the bad water situation, thank goodness for that.

As has been pointed out on this website, there is much pornography and voyeurs (like me) will peep in.  His sex scenes are okay.<br />But do women really behave this way?  How can a male author write in the first person as a female?  I know, all the authors do it, but like he says in his \\"epilogue,\\" remember it's only fiction.<br />It's only fiction because these educated people are apparently NEVER interested in anything intellectual, much less spiritual.  That's why they seem so narcissistic.  It's all about ME, ME, and ME, no matter who the character is.  Darnell's decision to follow his Tammy Rainbow in the end is, well, fitting with the narcissism.<br />But why shouldn't they be narcissistic?  They have no children, none of them, since Jake ordered all of his aborted...so much for his seed...he'll no doubt get over it and have others.  The children we meet at Stephan's parents' home in Baldwin Hills, briefly, are wanna-be gang-bangers.  This part is realistic.  Stephan's stepfather and mother are also very realistic.<br />But for people with supposedly interesting jobs and college degrees, don't you think they might have some interest in their work?  Besides receiving and making calls to their beaus?  That part is unrealistic.  <br />So, in the end, Mr. Dickey will please himself and his pocketbook.  He'll be the person Darnell wants to be, a published author who makes the big score and doesn't have to drudge in the mundane workaday world like everyone else...but Darnell being an attorney?  Well, he does owe his wife, I'd say, but that's fiction, right?  Leave the wife who stood by you while you went through law school, because (a) she had a brief affair and (b) she doesn't like having intercourse in the garage?  <br />Well, Darnell COULD have inspired the rest of us to go against our SELFISH inclination to watch out for NUMBER 1.  But no, he doesn't do that.  Attorney and bookwriter and all, he just shows us how to get for ME....the narcisstic way of life (certainly has much intellectual backing, for example, Ayn Rand, Robert Ringer, many, many more).<br />I like to think that we can rise above this animal level.  Mr. Erick Dickey probably knows how to rise above his own narcissism, since he's such a clever guy, but would writing about that make him money?  Maybe his other books are more along those lines.

These are my private limitations and restrictions, part of my individuality, which I must give up to be more open to Jesus and our Father, God.  <br />But are we really God's children?  What Mr. Fox leaves out, which has been emphasized elsewhere in commentaries, is that Jesus Christ differs from other prophets in one thing: He rose from the dead.  Muhammad didn't do this, Buddha didn't do this, Yogi Parmansa (who?) didn't do this.  But did Jesus really come back to life after dying?  This is the crux of the matter, and this is where faith comes into play.  <br />Assume, for a moment, that I'm not sure Jesus did come back to life (there's some other explanation for what is written in the Bible).  Still, I like what he said about the birds of the air and the lillies of the field, about turning the other cheek, about letting the suer have your two coats, non-resistance and just getting along.  Mr. Fox, on the other hand, obviously has no doubts about Jesus being Divine, so everything else just follows naturally.<br />I would like to see a little more light on the issue than just to assume first (a) and therefore, b, c, and we're sons of God.  Are we really?  I know, have faith or be damned.  <br />Well, riding the bus one day, two males in the back were talking, one saying how prostate cancer was very prolific among American males.

People from other states probably would not find much of interest, except tangentially (for example, Arizona is on a tangent to California?).<br />First, the authors review the history of the state, from the Native American roots through the Spanish and Mexican years, through the admission to the United States.  Following this is an interesting discussion of the types of government, from state to local, with helpful explanations.  The style of writing is clear, not verbose or arcane in any way.<br />Particularly helpful to me was the discussion of the evolution of the tax revolt, embodied in the Jarvis-Gann Initiative, which became law, limiting property tax values to 1% of assessed valuation.  Also, the etiology of the environmental movement, and of minority politics in California, was elucidated.  <br />For example, Californians are vaguely aware that water has always been problematic, especially in the more arid Southern California area.  Here in this book we learn the history of the various aquaducts and the ongoing battle between Northern and Southern California for water.  We surmise, therefrom, about what might happen in the future (for example, water shortages in Southern California, et cetera).  This will help us Californians to make decisions in the future, even if only by means of our one vote per person.<br />Californians of all ilks can benefit from this book, which offers a balanced and informative discussion of issues from the past up to the present.<br />Diximus	2003-03-30

There are also many quotes in Italian, and these might help aspiring linguists, like me.  Otherwise, only a few stalwarts will wade through this first half of the book.  <br />Later, in the second half of the book, the pace picks up some, when Mr. (Signore?) Sidona finally gets caught by the law's so-called long arm.  Mr. Tosches originally approached Sidona about a book after his fall from grace, while he was &quot;resting&quot; in an Italian prison.  Tosches keeps the ball of Sidona up in the air for a little bit longer, with this book, but maybe Sidona's ball deserves to just fall and come to a final resting point.  <br />I say this because, after all, Sidona wanted to play fast and loose, he took his inherent gifts (he was good with numbers, well educated and an avvocatto, a lawyer, and apparently was a personable sort of fellow with all the contacts he had), but what did he do with these talents?  Well, he tried to aggrandize himself, and is this any new story?  He ran with the wolves and he paid the price, end of story.  <br />Thanks to Nick Tosches for keeping the ball in the air a little longer.

This rather fits in with the fact that one of the protagonists is a Japanese woman, Nemoto, who lives from scene to scene in a metaphysical way.  Also, the inhabitants of the Moon are Japanese.<br />The Buddhistic element in the book is embodied in the idea that as humans, we believe we are separate and autonomous individuals.  But maybe, like computers, we are just electronic impulses with an aggrandized view of ourselves.  Pre-programmed at the factory, melted down and recycled when the newer generation of computers takes our place.  <br />Buddha taught something similar, didn't he?  Dissolving the ego? <br />In this context, there is a character in the book, somewhat minor really, named Dorothy Chaum.  She was really the most interesting character, because she starts out working for the Pope trying to convert aliens and Extra-terrestrials.<br />She ends up something far different than a practicing Catholic, something more like, what, a Buddhist?  And when you're flying around from galaxy to galaxy, visiting Venus, Triton, a strange Earth, seeing and feeling all sorts of strange feelings, living too long, who wouldn't be a Buddhist by then?  Anyway, there is little mention of Christ, but he must be flying around there somewhere also, wouldn't you think? <br />Well, this book is worth reading, but only the patient will be able to finish it.

I listened to the audiocassette of this massacre.  Massacres come out a little different on audio than they do in a movie, or in a book, or (!) in person?  Anyway, they're harder to follow, because the geography is abstract and so are the people.  All I know is that Colonel Carrington, Jim Bridger, and Sergeant Seamus Donnegan are the good guys.  Fetterman (I forget his rank, but he's a hotshot something) and Captain Brown are the bad guys (and they pay big time!). Man-afraid-of-his-horse, Curly, and Red Cloud are kind of like non-innocent bystanders: they wreak plenty of havoc, but it's not really they're fault, they're just sort of trying to &quot;get over&quot;?  I myself had never heard of the Fetterman Massacre (1866), ten years before Custer's turn.  Mr. Johnston, may he rest in peace, has educated me.  What better way to learn history?  But maybe the listener might benefit from having handy an atlas with detailed maps of the fighting area.  Maybe some biographical information about the combatants.  Anyway, worth listening, but needs some adjuncts.  And scary!  When you think about being in Fetterman's shoes, but then isn't all war scary?  Diximus.	2003-03-15

What we have here is a novel that borders on being non-fiction, because it adheres pretty closely to the archival record Mr. Taylor examined.  He read through many, many journals kept by soldiers, officers, and others, about their experiences in this Mexican War.  What Taylor comes up with is a somewhat entertaining \\"introduction\\" to the Mexican War.  It's an introduction for those who know little about the Mexican War, like myself.  I learned a lot from this book, and I re-learned that sometimes it's easier to swallow your history with a human story than straight from the history book.  BUT...as noted elsewhere on this website, the book does have a tendency to get dull.  Maybe Taylor tried too hard to make it authentic by mimicking the journal-keepers of those days.  Also, he spends a lot of time describing the flora, fauna, and architecture, and for spoiled readers of the present day, that may be a little too much work.  We need more short dialogue and less hard-core narrative, today.  So, this book, published in 1964, offers palatable history, but not much emotion or excitement, and very little sex, though there are women in this war, some dressed as men, and this, too, is based on journalistic evidence uncovered by Mr. Taylor, who I doubt still lives, though I don't know for sure.

I haven't finished reading any of the books, though I did start one. It seemed boring. This audio book was rather boring also. It did not arouse in me a sense of identifying with the so-called Christians, and Carpathia and his henchman, the one who talks with a Brooklyn accent, Fortunato, are both really kind of funny, not frightening at all. They're so easy to see through. I think the authors maybe wanted to sell books, of course, but in order to do that, they wanted to basically scare people, because people seem to like scary books (cf. Stephen King, etc.). But the Indwelling was not scary. It was absurd, unbelievable, and, judging from other books written about the Left Behind series (cf. Lisa Ruby's book), not really in accord with the Bible at all. I know a man who reads all of the Left Behind books, and likes them. He's not unusual in any way, but I think the books give him a sense of having a purpose in life, because if you're one of the few survivors, and you're on the right side, then you kind of stand out from the crowd. And the crowd is otherwise so huge, and, God forbid, what if there is no God, or God is not as we envision It in this particular book, in the Bible even? Then we're nothing (this is the old existential argument, cf. Sartre, Camus, etc.). And who wants to be nothing? So we can be something, somebody, by identifying with the heroes of the Left Behind series. Diximus.	2003-02-16

It was very boring, almost impossible to keep up with the characters, very little action, convoluted plot, ridiculous (by today's standards) love scenes over and over again with too many couples to keep track of.  The abridgement may have been part of the problem.  I had to finally go and read the dust jacket of the book to understand what the basic plot was: a mission in the Gobi desert by the Marines, to save a group trying to escape from the expected Japanese assault of China, and to erect a meteorology station.  I guess you have to understand World War II better than I do to understand why all of this was important to the war effort.  Also, it may have disadvantaged me that this is the first Griffin book I have tried, by listening or otherwise.  I can see where World War II buffs might get a big kick out of these endless details, constant references to rank, with virtually nothing said about the people's physical appearances, personality traits, et cetera, so that it's really hard to tell how one General or Lieutenant Colonel differs from another, and how they all differ from each other.  Well, I know the big names in the book: Roosevelt, Nimitz, MacArthur, \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan....but I would have liked more information on one of these individuals, more focus, more of a personality or psychological study instead of this roughshod back and forth geographical moves, jumping all over the world for brief snapshots of the goings-on of the heroes of this book, womanizers for the most part.  Ah jus' don' get it, Cap'n McCoy! (he's the main man, as opposed to the Generals, methinks, at least I got that much). If any of this is autobiographical, Mr.  Griffin must have led a very confusing life.  OCD?  Diximus with feeling.	2003-02-15

And there is something to learn here about the war in Viet Nam, as some others on this website have indicated. The protagonists, Paxton and her first lover, Peter, who dies from \\"friendly fire\\" 5 days after being sent over to \\"Nam,\\" seem somewhat extraordinary, but who's to say a romance has to be realistic? Even one having to do with a war? I enjoyed the book most when Paxton finally got to Viet Nam as a reporter. Those episodes did help me to understand the war better.

The publisher, Scholastic, gives readers a clue about the goal of the whole book: to inspire youngsters.  These basketball heroes, Kareem, Nate Thurmond, Walton, and several others who rose briefly (but with vigor) in the 1970s and 1980s, are answers to trivia questions now (Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain are the \\"bad guys\\" in this book, everyone being compared to those two as far as \\"big guy status\\").  What I learned from this book, or what I found confirmed, is that sports cycles are small life cycles: the stars are born, live a short life, and die in about five to ten years, give or take a few years.  It's sad when they \\"die,\\" that is, when former heroes become nothing more than, well, retired former heroes.  But, as we know from our spiritual training, \\"there is life after death,\\" and these big guys continue on in the afterlife, frequently staying in the game as coaches.  This book may inspire youngsters, but only if they're about forty years old or older. Diximus.	2003-02-12

Oh, Delia's uncle Tab is also a cop, Tony's superior, and he is more than a little ambivalent about his niece following in his footsteps.  Especially in the Southside of Dallas, where all the druggies and gang bangers hang.  Maybe on the Northside, where the manicured lawns of the white families leave little for cops to do.  Well, after some soul-searching, both Tony and Delia give a little to accommodate their love for each other, and the story ends with a bang (a whimper?), which brings the whole book up to average level (3 stars).  If you don't know Dallas, you may learn a little about its demography.  You won't learn much else, but some emotions may be aroused.  In the end, you may wonder how long the marriage of Tony and Delia is going to last.  It's one of those based on physical attraction, and the couple never does get around to discussing finances, children, and other details of a marital relationship.  My guess is they'll stick it out for maybe five years, a little longer if they have a child or two, but not much.  Diximus.	2003-02-05

Unfortunately for those of us dummies who start reading the series in the middle, there's a lot of old war stories that just don't make sense.  Half of this book cannot be read unless you know the prior goings-on.  Too bad, because the other half could stand on its own.  In this free-standing half, we have the story of Titus (aka \\"Scratch\\") joining up with his trapper buds (and some not so buds) to steal horses from the Mexicans in California.  There's much excitement in this endeavor, and no little killing.  Following which there's a boring interlude in which Scratch makes his way through the mountains back to his wife and kids.  They all set out for Taos, NM, although you have to be privy to earlier books to have the slightest idea why (characters from earlier books pop in and out constantly, with no other introduction to speak of, except little footnotes which Mr. Johnston is kind enough to supply, indicating which of his prequels will reference the individual).  In Taos, a real hair-raising scenario ends the book, based on history, apparently.  The killing which takes place there makes the American Psycho look like Peter Pan.  Thus, the good, the bad, and the many passages you can skip.  Diximus.	2003-01-31

This outfit, Green Band, is apparently responsible for bombing half of Wall Street and stealing bearer bonds, then fencing them.  The plot is just a tad convoluted, but apparently a cabal of American elitists are behind the whole thing, fronted by a disgruntled former Vietnam POW, Colonel David Hudson, who ends up getting these so-called \\"patriots\\" back in the end.  Meanwhile, an FBI higher-up turns out to be a world-renowned terrorist (modeled after Carlos Ramirez, the so-called Jackal), and this seems slightly implausible, too.  But it does make you think: especially with all the current terrorist threats and the relatively recent concept of gauging the state of the world by the state of the stock markets.  I wonder, though, if stealing bearer bonds and securities is such a big risk, why hasn't all of this been turned into an electronic system by now?  We're talking, according to Mr. Patterson, billions of stolen stocks and bonds.  Now, would an average consumer keep around cash in the house, when he has ATMs and credit cards?  Why can't Wall Street do that?  Or maybe they already have?  Anyway, it seemed implausible to me that someone could actually steal that much from Wall Street, but this book was written about a decade ago and things can change pretty quickly.  Archer Carroll, the hard-working cop who never gives up, even when his children are threatened, and who ends up \\"getting the girl\\" in the end, is the hero here.  His wife had died years prior, and the head of investigations for the SEC falls in love with him.  This also seemed slightly implausible, not that an SEC master bean counter can't fall in love, but, hey, being an acrobat in bed and all?  Hmmmm...anyway, rates a 4 overall....highly relevant to today's world but some implausibilities and convolutions in the plot that may detract from those who prefer more realistic goings-on.

Earl's son by a previous liaison, Jeff, is a chip off the old block.  Tagging alongside are two Chicano \\"gang bangers,\\" actually more low riders than gang bangers, Ronnie Cruise (note how he anglicized his name, maybe that's a fad in San Antonio?) and a loco guy named Ramirez who gets boxed to death later in the book.  In fact, of these four, only Ronnie remains standing, with Billy Bob, when the final bell rings.  There are other women, including Esmeralda Ramirez, who is variously a college student, Jeff's wife, Ronnie's girlfriend, and the girlfriend of Billy Bob's son, not in that order, however.  Then there's a corrupt, racist, fat sheriff (what would a Southern town be without one?), and various \\"white trash\\" figures who cross back and forth over the criminal line as forces carry them.  Well, the result of all this, in my humble opinion, is a three-star book.  As others on this website have pointed out, there's a lot to wade through for the action that's delivered, maybe a little too much attention to minor detail.  But does this really differ much from Robert Parker describing what his private dick had for breakfast, lunch and dinner?  Or from Robert Crais telling us what the sunset in Santa Clarita looked like as the police and FBI surround an upscale single family residence housing three kidnappers?  Not really.  So, there's something here, but you might have to wade through some of the slower parts, skim it or skip it.  Billy Bob's encounter with his deceased crime partner, his ghost, that is, is actually rather interesting, because how often do you get anything even bordering on the metaphysical in this type of fiction?

It will definitely arouse emotions.  The book has been variously described elsewhere as a satire, a fantasy, or a documentary based on an actual diary.  To me, it would be best described as a cross between a fantasy and a satire.  One thing for sure: the graphic descriptions of Patrick Bateman's destruction of female bodies are difficult to read, and I'm not usually squeamish.  Another finding in my case: reading this book made me feel dirty and sinful.  I had to stop at one point and set it aside for at least two weeks before finally struggling through again.  On the positive side, the book does encourage self-reflection and in that respect it would be good to feel dirty and sinful, for a little while anyway.  It was especially helpful to me to understand precisely what passages of the book have aroused those particular feelings.  Another point: Patrick Bateman has a strong interest in other mass murderers, especially Ted Bundy, who was also something of a &quot;lady's man&quot; when he flourished (?).  Knowing that the world created a Ted Bundy is to know that the world could also create a Patrick Bateman, possibly living in our midst at this moment.  Anyway, that's the reason Mr. Ellis's book hits a strong emotional chord, &quot;it could happen here.&quot;  It probably is happening here, &quot;even as we speak.&quot;  So, this book is not everyone's cup of tea, but it's an interesting read for those who like going to the limit, vicariously, that is.

Good points: For adults, reminds you of Bible stories you may have forgotten.  For adults, helps you to feel good about reading something tangentially spiritual.  For adults and children, the pictures are cute, helping you to visualize the characters better.  For young children, the required reading level is quite low, so even young children just starting to read can handle this book.  Not so good points: Trivializes the Bible stories, making them seem more like fairy tales than anything that could possibly be true.  Children may take them as fairy tales, and as they mature, may be inclined to reject them because of that, in a manner analogous to rejecting, for example, Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, etc.  But, Mr. Sinatra sings the last word: maybe those fairy tales can come true, if you're young at heart!	2003-01-16

They come twenty years later than Hippies, though, so maybe they're Neo-Hippies?  I don't know if the rest of the world is quite ready for their free lifestyle, yet, but Los Angeles may be.  Weetzie meets a gay man, Dirk, whose grandmother dies and leaves him her house, so that wish is granted.  Weetzie meets a genie out of a lamp, which reminded me of someone hallucinating on a drug, another connection to the Hippie era.  Then Dirk meets a lover, Duck, and Weetzie meets a lover, \\"My Secret Agent Man Lover,\\" or something like that, so all three of her wishes have been granted.  But it's not all Shangri-La in LaLa Land.  MSAML runs off when Weetzie wants to get pregnant (he returns later).  Duck discovers AIDS (though it's not indicated that he has it) and runs away to save his lover, but he also returns.  However, Weetzie's father, once a wannabe script writer, doesn't make it, an apparent suicide.  Weetzie has her baby, MSAML has an outside baby, so the six of them, plus dogs and other pets, make up the household.

Then there's a real twist in the plot which actually seems quite implausible.  Basically, what happens is that a police detective is found murdered and his body is left in a public place more or less on display.  His adulteress, a teenage stripper, is arrested and charged with the murder.  Mr. Kincaid gets her off, not once but twice, in the face of what seem like insurmountable odds.  The young lady even testifies on her own behalf.  The detective's widow states under oath that she hates the woman who stole her husband.  Kincaid, who is unmarried and lonely, starts to fantasize about having a relationship with the young stripper.  She seems so needy, and she's beautiful.  Her brother, Kirk, whose presence in the novel seems gratuitous since he doesn't do much but torture himself and then commit suicide, is really strange.  All of this takes place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, of course.  Well, after convincing a tough jury that his client is innocent, and that the late Kirk is the actual murderer, Kincaid finds out he's been hoodwinked by the stripper and by the ex-wife, who are actually in cahoots, actually lovers.  This denouement is unexpected, but it just seems too fantastic.  That's why I say, \\"Tulsa must be a strange place.\\"  But nonetheless the book does hold interest somewhat, although Bernhardt tends to repeat himself, first through narrative description then the same material regurgitated during the trial as the characters testify.  You can skim those parts, though, and finish the book in a couple of day.  Diximus.	2003-01-14

This book is a fast read, kept my interest.  But the ethical conclusions are that \\"true\\" Mafioso are somehow blessed (by God?), maybe by the Virgin Mary, because Christ, being after all a man, cannot be fully trusted (op. cit.).  Astorre Viola, the product of a union between a 78 year old Sicilian \\"Don\\" and his last lover, who dies right away, is destined to become a \\"man of respect.\\"  Yes, he shoots people in the head, and orders his henchmen to do the same.  But so what.  He also shows mercy to people who catch his fancy.  What a great guy!  Just about all the other characters surrounding Astorre are murdered before the end of the book, including an FBI agent.  But he lives happily ever after in Sicily, on an estate left him by his father, married to the woman who lured two of his victims (hit men) to their final bunkers.  It was obvious, from the beginning, who was going to survive and who was not going to survive.  Idealizing the Mafia seems wrong, somehow.  Astorre is the hero of this book, but people who take him as a hero are likely to condone killing, as long as said killing demonstrates \\"loyalty\\" and \\"keeping your word.\\"  Youth gangs come to mind.  Mike Davis in City of Quartz noted that the gangs of Los Angeles resembled \\"proto-Mafia\\" assemblages, and no doubt such gang leaders admire the Mafia.  Puzo does the world a disservice in making Astorre an enchanted hero.  But the world is fascinated by evil (cf. the local daily newspaper) so Puzo only complies with the world's wishes.  What other entertainer, who wants to please his public and make money, has not done the same?  (They're all sellouts!)  In that respect, he does a good job.  It is a fascinating account of evil overcoming evil.  Diximus.	2003-01-12

Basically, he shows us what is wrong with the profit-making system: people get brushed aside.  The fact that communism is dead does not mean that capitalism is yet the best system.  If we actually follow what Mr. Fifer proposes, we probably will increase profits, but at what cost?  Are we only robots to be programmed for the good of the capitalistic ethos, for the good of the corporation?  Yes, Mr. Fifer does confess that he reserves his special time for his family by not traveling on weekends.  He also decries workaholism.  He is capable of drawing the line, but is everyone else in his special position?  I doubt it.  Many people are going to swallow his philosophy and ruin themselves, \\"for the good of society,\\" or \\"for the bottom line.\\"  But let's assume that Mr. Fifer's basic philosophy is correct, that is, that maximizing profit is the best goal because it is in accord with the evolution of the human species, etc.  In that case, we are really subservient to the economic system, and nothing more than that.  If that's the case, then we embark (again?) into a \\"Big Brother\\" type of world where \\"fear and loathing\\" are the watchwords, because we really don't count for anything more than what we can contribute to the precious bottom line.  Gone is any Higher Power, the Bottom Line is the Higher Power.  If this is the case, and who's to say it's not (maybe those who believe in a Higher Power other than the Bottom Line?), then all I can say is some of us really are deluded.  And maybe that's Mr. Fifer's point after all: sweep out all of this delusion and these deluded people and concentrate on the Bottom Line (but save your weekends for your family, so your kids won't go on drugs, because they also have to play their role as Bottom Line Robots, when their time comes, and drug-users are distinctly disabled in the Bottom Line culture, unless of course they reserve their drinking anddrug use for the weekends or after working hours).
