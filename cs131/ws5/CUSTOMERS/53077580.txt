Do you praise employees who sit at their desks and work for hours at a time without a break? Do you measure engagement in work by how long a person persists at a task without stopping? If so, Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz would tell you to change your ways. The authors are founders of and executives at LGE Performance Systems, an executive training program based on athletic coaching programs. Their full engagement training system embodies the methods of interval or periodical training used by elite athletes to maximize performance capacity. The authors urge us to approach our work activities like a sprinter, not a marathoner, balancing stress and recovery. <br /> <br />Loehr and Schwartz state the essence of their system in this passage: \\"Balancing stress and recovery is critical not just in competitive sports, but also in managing energy in all facets of our lives. Emotional depth and resilience depend on active engagement with others and with our own feelings.\\" A recent Gallup poll has confirmed suspicions that the majority of workers are not deeply engaged in their work. At the same time, we keep hearing about the intense pressures on executives and resulting problems of burnout. Pushing ourselves and others to do more for longer won't work. We will reach full engagement, say Loehr and Schwartz when we skillfully manage energy in all dimensions: physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual.  <br /> <br />Full engagement comes when we are physically energized, mentally focused, emotionally connected, and spiritually aligned. The authors explain what each of these requires and say that the most fundamental source of energy is physical, while the most significant is spiritual. Unfortunately, most of us are undertrained physically and spiritually and overtrained mentally and emotionally.  <br /> <br />To build ourselves up to a level of full engagement requires realizing that fully engaged energy rather than time is ourmost precious resource, and that energy capacity is diminished by both overuse-chronic stress without recovery-and underuse-chronic recovery without stress. Therefore, we must learn to balance energy expenditure with intermittent energy renewal. To build capacity we must push beyond our normal limits while managing energy carefully. Positive energy rituals can help us do this.  <br /> <br />The book's resources include a summary of the full engagement training system, a list of the most important physical energy management strategies, glycemic index examples, and the full engagement personal development plan worksheet. Loehr and Schwartz do a good job of explaining the principles of the system, but the training program itself could be better defined. However, executives should be in their element developing and customizing the program.	2005-10-08

If nothing else, this is a new age of declarations of a new age. In the business realm, these new eras usually revolve around empowered customers, Internet-related technologies, or non-hierarchical organizations and styles of leadership. Stan Davis and David McIntosh's vision has much in common with some of the more customer-centered visions, such as that expressed in Joseph Pine and James Gilmore's The Experience Economy. By opening up to the power of artistic flow, businesses can learn from the arts in areas including managing creativity, identifying talent, finding meaning in work, and working toward peak performance. The authors are urging executives to \\"make all your work a work of art.\\" <br /> <br />Why are we on the edge of a shift toward the aesthetic in business now? In common with many others before them, Davis and McIntosh assert that after moving from the Industrial Age to the Information Age, we are stepping into yet another era. In \\"Revenge of the Right Brain\\", Daniel Pink argued that the logical, left-brain thinking behind the Information Age was giving way to a new \\"Conceptual Age\\" that prizes artistry, empathy, and emotion. <br /> <br />Similarly, Davis and McIntosh believe we are being driven beyond the Information Age by three basic forces: the rise of sound and images; the emotionally richer communication these enable; and the fact that these changes are happening faster outside than inside the organization. Just as executives now accept the importance of corporate culture-an idea that was little appreciated until twenty years ago-they are now beginning to recognize the benefits of focusing on the aesthetic and emotional dimensions of work and business. <br /> <br />The Art of Business compares the economic flow of business-its inputs, processes, and outputs-to the equally real artistic flow. We need not choose one or the other; we can look at business through both perspectives at once. Artistic processes can also be understood in terms of inputs, processes, and outputs, even though the elements are very different. The elements of economic flow are inputs of raw materials or factors of production; all the processes of creation, production, and consumption in the value chain that transform inputs into outputs; and outputs of goods and services that aim to be better, faster, cheaper, and safer. The elements of artistic flow are imagination, emotion, intelligence, and experience; processes of creation, performance, and appreciation; and outputs that aim at beauty, excitement, enjoyment, and meaning. <br /> <br />After exploring the ideas of dualities and artistic flow, Davis and McIntosh organize the bulk of The Art of Business around what they see as the main elements of artistic flow, then conclude with twenty suggestions for imbuing your work with artistry. The experienced business reader will come across numerous familiar examples, from the iPod to JetBlue, and far fewer fresh examples. You will find the occasional glittering nugget, such as one that crops up in discussing rich communications: \\"If Andy Warhol were still alive, he would say that, in the future, everybody will be famous for fifteen people.\\" This is the best line in the book, and is accompanied by little to enlighten all but the most cloistered executives. In the end, most readers are likely to extract more benefit from The Experience Economy or Postrel's The Substance of Style, or from articles such as \\"The New Frontier of Experience Innovation\\" and \\"Lean Consumption.\\"	2005-05-17

You know you need your workforce to perform at its best. Yet you suspect that you could be managing employees more effectively and drawing more out of them. The difficulty lies in effectively and precisely aligning employee activity with strategic goals. This is where Huselid, Becker, and Beatty come to the rescue in this follow-up to their previous book, The HR Scorecard: Linking People, Strategy, and Performance. The Workforce Scorecard argues that to make the most of strategy execution, companies must meet three challenges: the perspective challenge, the metrics challenge, and the execution challenge. They can do this by adopting a workforce scorecard consisting of four elements. <br /> <br />The authors present three central points of their approach as challenges because these requirements for workforce management and measurement will go counter to the existing order in many organizations. The perspective challenge calls on companies to view their workforce in terms of contribution rather than cost. The metrics challenge means replacing benchmarking metrics with measures that differentiate levels of strategic impact. The execution challenge requires making line managers and HR professionals jointly responsible for executing workforce initiatives. <br /> <br />Before diving into great detail on the construction of the framework, Huselid, Becker, and Beatty first explain how the workforce scorecard fits into the more general scorecard approach. They intend to refer to a specific kind of business performance, strategy execution, in the tradition of Kaplan and Norton's balanced scorecard. The workforce scorecard sits in between the balanced scorecard-which addresses the company's strategy and operational goals along with a strategy map, and the HR scorecard-which focuses on HR systems and HR workforce competencies. Although they take the trouble to explain how the threescorecards interrelate, the authors note that they do not believe a company must use all three. <br /> <br />The book then goes on to explain and detail the four elements of the scorecard: workforce success, workforce mind-set and culture, workforce competencies, leadership and workforce behaviors. The authors devote chapters to explaining the three central challenges from the perspectives of the CEO and senior executive leadership team, line managers, and the HR function. Another chapter explores in depth the work of data analysis, decision making, and communication of workforce metrics. The final chapter integrates all these elements by explaining the defining characteristics of organizations that have successfully met the challenges. These include six characteristics to define the right perspective, eight to define the right measures, and six to define the right execution. <br /> <br />The only reason I'm not giving this book 5 stars (which I give very rarely) is that I'd like to see empirical evidence for the effectiveness of this scorecard process to confirm its theoretical plausibility. In addition, I do have some doubts about the probability that many companies will actually use such a sophisticated approach, particularly if it's up to HR.	2005-05-04

He relates a large part of that personal history in Birth of the Chaordic Age even though, he claims, this is not a story about him, nor about VISA International, although both figure prominently in the tale. The book is not so much a story at all, but a passionate manifesto for the future of business and society as a whole. If almost anyone else had written a book of such grand - perhaps grandiose - pretensions, we would quickly dismiss them. But Hock is known as the founder and former CEO of VISA International. He explains that he founded the organization on \\"chaordic principles\\". This business now connects over 20,000 financial institutions, 14 million merchants, and 600 million consumers in 220 countries. That's a compelling argument for allowing the man to speak.  <br /> <br />Hock's book is a masterfully written broadside against the dominance of today's command-and-control institutions. He is far from alone in the outlines of his historical perspective. According to this, over the last three centuries we have increasingly sought to structure society according to reductionism, specialization, more technology, more efficiency, more linear education and processes, and more hierarchical command and control. The goal has been to create an organization in which leaders can pull a lever and reliably produce a desired result.  <br /> <br />Hock goes further than most who share this perspective when he talks of the \\"dominator organizations\\" that have ordered resources and people so as to produce large quantities of uniform goods. Instead of the expected results, claims Hock, what we have produced is \\"obscene maldistribution of wealth and power, a crumbling ecosphere, and collapsing societies.\\" This apocalyptically gloomy view may be trendy, but has only a passing resemblance to reality. (For a brief alternative view, see \\"The Truth About the Environment\\", related to this review.) Readers need not share Hock's assessment of todayin order to learn from, agree with, and help to implement his alternative vision of chaordic organizations - those that are simultaneously chaotic and orderly.  <br /> <br />The positive vision expounded on in Birth of the Chaordic Age sees organizations of the future as being the embodiment of community, based on shared purpose calling to the higher aspirations of people. Hock puts this general description into more specific form by explaining how a chaordic organization is formed by attending to six elements in the proper order: Purpose, Principles, People, Concept, Structure and Practice.  <br /> <br />Hock claims that VISA was formed according to this description - the unusual organization is owned by its member banks, which combine competition for customers with cooperation by honoring each other's transactions across borders and monetary systems. If this is true, then you may persist in reading the book for its vision, despite some annoying peccadilloes, such as Hock's talk of \\"Old Monkey Mind\\" (his rational thoughts).	2005-03-25

The 18 pieces are gathered into three groups covering strategy, process, and metrics. Although the volume can certainly serve well as a general introduction to knowledge management, the editors make no bones about their distinctly learning-centric (as distinct from information-centric) perspective that they take.  <br /> <br />The information-centric approach, which has been dominant in the field until recently (and still is among consultants with IT systems to sell), emphasizes knowledge as explicit, and as susceptible of being captured, stored, and processed. The contributors to this book instead emphasize the continuous generation, acquisition and application of knowledge in its human and cultural context. This perspective permeates each of the essays and all three of the sections. Those sections begin with a classic work then move onto more contemporary thinking along compatible lines.  <br /> <br />The \\"Strategy\\" section, which begins with two pieces by Peter Senge, examines the motivation for knowledge management and explores how to structure a knowledge management program. Takeuchi and Nonaka's classic paper, \\"Theory of Organizational Knowledge Creation\\" opens the \\"Process\\" section, which looks at how managers can implement knowledge management effectively, applying it to help make existing practices more effective and to speed up organizational learning. The final section on Metrics covers the use of the Balanced Scorecard, the measurement of intangibles, and metrics for knowledge sharing.  <br /> <br />Busy executives need not be deterred by the length of this book. They can read the opening classic pieces,then look only at those following pieces with the most relevance to their concerns and circumstances. Margaret Wheatley's introduction, \\"Can Knowledge Management Succeed Where Other Efforts Have Failed?\\", is well worth reading for her concise and lucid account of the common beliefs in organizations that have caused problems for KM. These include beliefs that organizations are machines, only material things are real, that only numbers are real, that you can only manage what you can measure, and that technology is the savior.	2005-03-25

Our opinion of collective decision making and behavior has been darkened by first-hand observation of events such as the stock market bubble and crash, and by classic works such as Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, and The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind. That is unfortunate, argues James Surowiecki because, under the right circumstances, groups \\"are remarkably intelligent, and are often smarter than the smartest people in them.\\"<br /><br />If nothing else, The Wisdom of Crowds should entertain you. It may not do much more than this if you are already well read in economics, complexity theory, decision analysis, organizational theory, social psychology, prospect theory and other fields. Few readers will have delved into all the relevant areas to any great extent, so most can expect to learn something new, interesting, and quite possibly useful. Surowiecki's wide-ranging gathering of sources to support his argument is a virtue, yet it's also something of a problem. The difficulty of knowing much about all the areas on which he draws makes it easy for him to pick and choose studies and arguments selectively. While many of his points are well made, the way he supports his case sometimes seems one-sided.<br /><br />In evaluating and supporting the idea of the wisdom of crowds, Surowiecki looks at how collective intelligence can be applied to three kinds of problems: Cognition problems (which have definitive solutions), coordination problems, and cooperation problems (which require self-interested agents to work together). The first half of the book sets out the theory, thoroughly and entertainingly illustrated by examples. These include the smarts of the audience on game shows, how to design an excellent search engine, why short selling is a good thing, and how a group finds a lost submarine. The second half of the book applies the ideas to show various ways in which people organize toward common goals in cases such astraffic, science, juries, committees, business organizations, markets, and democracies.<br /><br />Among the main points that may be useful to executives, Surowiecki emphasizes that for the crowd to be wise, it must be characterized by diversity of opinion, independence of members from one another, and a specific kind of decentralization, and there needs to be a good method for aggregating opinions. He stresses that the best collective decisions result from disagreement and contest, not consensus or compromise.<br /><br />While corporations often rely on experts, the book does well at challenging our confidence in expertise as compared to the average of the crowd. In the course of a discussion of the role of independence, we learn that to improve your organization's decision making you should ensure that decisions are made simultaneously rather than one after the other. Finally, I have to second Surowiecki's puzzlement at the apparent lack of interest by companies in using markets (such as decision markets) for corporate strategy and market research.	2005-03-25

The simple message of Simply Better is that in single-mindedly pursuing differentiation, many companies have failed miserably in their stated goal to be \\"customer-focused\\". Except for relatively rare instances, customers care little for the addition of unique features and clever innovations. What they really want is the reliable delivery of \\"generic category benefits\\" - products that *work* and reliable services that take place on time. Although companies often dismiss this as \\"table stakes\\", the data show that businesses fail to deliver these basics far too often.  <br /> <br />If time is of the essence, it is my editorial duty to let you know that you will find most of the important ideas of this book in the authors' MIT Sloan Management Review article, \\"Don't Be Unique, Be Better.\\" Barwise and Meehan do not entirely dismiss the conventional wisdom that competitive positioning and differentiation require companies to offer customers something they cannot find elsewhere, but they do insist that this has distracted companies from maintaining a true customer focus and from delivering the essential category benefits valued by customers. The only area in which differentiation is clearly the right way to go, they argue, is in your advertising and marketing messages. Elsewhere, they urge companies to think \\"inside the box\\" by refining, perfecting, and delivering on the essentials that customers badly want. The failure of companies to do this has created deep customer dissatisfaction.  <br /> <br />The good news in this is that organizations that adopt a true customer-centric perspective can generate a low-risk, high return opportunity. To help your business reach this state of genuine customer-centricity, the authors first explain how customers see your brand and make purchase decisions. They then explain how to convert that understanding into a clear view of what customers really value. These are the actual (and potential) generic category benefits. The book also examines the management challenges to creating these benefits.  <br /> <br />The last chapter sums up by providing six rules to becoming \\"simply better\\": Think category benefits, not unique brand benefits; think simplicity, not sophistication; think inside, not outside, the box; think opportunities, not threats; for creative advertising, forget rule 3; think immersion, not submersion. This last principle refers to the authors' discussion of important arguments in favor of managers getting out of their offices and directly interacting with customers. This kind of immersion works because it avoids distorted images of customer reality, it helps filter indirect data such as market research, it acts as a source of storytelling and anecdote, and it spreads the results of both learning and the act of learning.  <br /> <br />If you decide to read this book, rather than the excellent article-length distillation, you'll find some other fine points that often go well beyond the article. Contrary to the usual concentration on measuring customer satisfaction, Barwise and Meehan make a strong case for measuring and monitoring the drivers of *dissatisfaction*. They add to what seems to be a recent trend by emphasizing the risks and drawbacks of flanking strategies that require strategic innovations, arguing that it is usually better to be an excellent imitator. Chapter 6, \\"Customer-Focused Mind-Set\\", sets out a refreshing (though not truly original) view of \\"fast and right processes and a pure air culture\\". These honor the practices of \\"hard work decision making\\", \\"accountable experimentation\\", and a culture in which challenge and debate are seen as forces for good throughout the organization, and where no one expects an easy yes to proposals.	2004-09-14

Evenson takes us into the mythical Kingdom of Kaos, where a smart wizard advises the king on how to transform a poor business environment resulting from bad decision making and ineffective communication. The easy-to-swallow format of the book should not distract the reader from its solid theoretical foundations in decision making and creativity methods.  <br /> <br />From the outset, Evenson makes it clear that the thoughts in this tale are simplified fictional presentations of ideas formulated by others. First among those sources is Michael Kirton, from whom Evenson learned the ways of the KAI cognitive profile, \\"the three levels of opportunity\\", \\"Problems A and B\\", and others. She adds to the brew a range of methods for decision making, creative thinking, and communication from several sources (several of which we have reviewed and have linked to this review). Evenson's method of presentation differs from that of Patrick Lencioni, whose tales come to a close before the non-fictional explanation begins. She sprinkles the story of the kingdom of Kaos throughout with \\"thoughts and explanations\\" boxes, and \\"Quantum Leap\\" exercises for the reader. <br /> <br />The disarming simplicity of Redefining F.E.A.R. puts a sugar coating on a considerable collection of well-tried methodologies. As the wizard gradually brings wisdom to the king, we encounter the Five-Step Collaborative Problem-Solving Process, an introduction to visioning, tips on making effective use of diversity in cognition and personality, the multiple-lens technique, ways to identify unwritten rules, and several idea generation methods. If you are running up against low morale, decreased productivity, ineffective communication, wasted time, and uncreative thinking, you may find the 140-page Redefining F.E.A.R. to be an easy yet effective way to help you change direction.	2004-08-27

Rather than blaming the failure of a previously excellent company on incompetence, corruption, laziness, or lack of imagination, Sull locates the problem of stumbling giants in active inertia: the tendency of management to respond to disruptive changes by accelerating activities that succeeded in the past. In Revival of the Fittest, Sull analyzes this barrier and helps managers tackle the demanding task of overcoming it. <br />To overcome active inertia, Sull recommends neither evolutionary nor revolutionary change typically prescribed for faltering champions. Instead he explains the power of transforming commitments. Commitments matters, he explains, in that they both enable effective management and can disable it when they no longer fit what is needed. Managers select, make, honor, and less often remake commitments or binding actions by investing capital, making personnel decisions, exiting a business, making public promises, making public promises, forging relationships with resource providers, writing contracts, or by manipulating information. Commitments are a powerful tool for creating the desired future but they also become cognitive, cultural, and structural shackles that prevent a company from changing - even when the need to change is clear to all. <br />Companies take shape at the beginning of the \\"life cycle of commitments\\" through defining commitments consisting of strategic frames, resources, processes, relationships, and values. The character of the organization hardens over time as managers make reinforcing commitments large and small. The best companies develop a \\"success formula\\" that becomes the envy of competitors and the source of best practices for writers and consultants. This story takes a tragic turn when, eventually and inevitably, a gap opens and widens between the nature of the company and the business environment. The only way out - if one exists at all - is through transforming commitments that require boldness, prudence, and tenacity. <br />Sull uses pairs of companies to show how some have spiraled down while others successfully made and kept their transforming commitments. IBM's justly famous transformation under Gerstner exemplifies the latter, though this is only one of a wide range of illuminating examples in the book. Sull casts light on the active inertia trap which can arise from the basis of any of the original defining commitments. He follows this with eight risk factors to check for and some diagnostic tests to administer. If transforming commitments fit your situation, you must then choose the right anchor. This may be a new strategic frame but may also be new resources, processes, relationships, or values. The right anchor needs to be worked on by the right person who gives the transforming commitments traction by making commitments credible, clear, and courageous. <br />Since commitments are powerful tools, Sull's cautious advice includes an unflinching look at seven common mistakes that can lead transformation efforts off-track. Neither does Sull allow managers to anticipate the benefits without also appreciating the personal costs. The book does not try to delve deeply into every relevant aspect of each stage, allow the book to convey vital points while remaining slim enough for busy executives to actually read.	2003-11-27

Today's companies need to bring their misaligned, overlapping, and inconsistent projects into alignment through \\"frontier living\\". This means delivering results in the present while adapting for the future's business context by using four \\"traits\\" to configure your project portfolio for confusing, volatile, and unpredictable conditions. <br />The title of the book refers to the need to &quot;connect the dots&quot; between an organization's objectives and its project investments to create and balance present and future value. The book's plethora of tools combined with the easygoing writing style makes it engaging and painless to absorb. Benko and McFarlan can be forgiven for overstating the role of project alignment - that is, after all, the standard book author's tendency. It is true, however, that companies project initiatives total up into the trillions of dollars and it requires no stretch to accept the claim that those initiatives have grown faster than companies' ability to manage them. Benko and McFarlan focus on the project portfolio as the most promising key to unlocking value, arguing that the portfolio is a company's future currency. We find their underlying principle that \\"companies are better served by adapting themselves for the future rather than by trying to predict its destination\\" to be a sound one.<br />Alignment, in this book, specifically means aligning three drivers of business performance: a company's project portfolio with its objectives; the projects in the portfolio to each other; and the portfolio and company's objectives with the ever-changing realities of the business context. To prosper on the \\"information frontier\\", certain shifts in mind-set - \\"traits\\" - are needed. Along with operational short-term and strategic long-term objectives, these constitute the organization's *intentions*. Four traits are used throughout the book as each of the various tools are explained and applied: Eco-Driven (effective collaborations), Outside-In (looking at yourself the way others look at you), Fighting Trim (agility, coordination, and options orientation to deal with uncertainty and respond to change), and House in Order (provisioning the other traits to enable cross-enterprise collaboration). <br />The seven alignment tools in this book fall three groups. The Trait Meter assesses, plans, and measures trait development according to the four traits. Once this first step is completed (which includes creating an Intentions Framework), the second group of diagnostic tools comes into play: The Intentions, Sides, and Right Brain tools. These measure the nature and size of the alignment opportunity, identify organizational bias and sort projects into business activities, and identify change capacity issues. The third group of tools - Common Threads, Project Chunking, and What-If Planning - focus on building flexibility into the portfolio. <br />Working through the book for real will, of course, be far more challenging than merely reading it. But the authors have done a good job of clarifying important issues of alignment and have provided a workable and appealing framework and toolset for tackling those issues.<BR>(3 stars from me is good. 4-star ratings are given too easily.)	2003-11-27

Every enterprise needs to be creative at all times, in all areas, and in all activities. This is what Jeff Mauzy and Richard Harriman call \\"systematic creativity\\". Their call for universal and constant creativity might be a slight stretch but it stretches in the right direction. The universal nature of their opening message does not carry over into some unique formula for fostering systemic creativity. Instead of one \\"right\\" way, they draw on four decades of research in the field of creativity to set out basic principles and practical techniques that have endured. <br />The emphasis on tested principles and practices in place of a fixed recipe is the first of six underlying central assumptions for the book. The second assumption is that creativity and innovation are two distinct concepts. The authors follow clear practice in distinguishing creativity - \\"the generation of novel and appropriate ideas\\" - from innovation - which \\"implements those ideas\\". A third central assumption is that creativity occurs in three areas: individuals, coalitions and teams, and organizations.  <BR>The remaining pillars that hold up the perspective of Creativity, Inc.: Underlying creativity are four interconnected dynamics that form the \\"heartbeat\\" of systemic creativity: motivation, curiosity and fear, the breaking and making of connections, and evaluation; Creativity depends on climate; Systematic creativity asks everyone to be a leader. <br />This stimulating, informative, and cleanly written book is organized in three parts. Part I, Creative Thinking, Part II, Climate, and Part III, Action. The first two parts examine a range of aspects involved in building individual and organizational creative capability, while the final part shows how to connect creativity to purposeful work. Happily, the authors understand that organizations find it easier to boost creativity temporarily; making it stick as an integralpart of the organization is much tougher. They devote the final chapter to \\"Sustaining the Change\\". <br />If you're the kind of reader who likes to go beyond the main text and dig into the authors' sources and references, you'll be delighted to find that the compact (185 pages) of the main text is followed by copious chapter notes and references. Creativity, Inc. provides a rich set of principles and tools for steeping every aspect of your organization in creativity. Mauzy and Harriman's book on systemic creativity complements work on systematic innovation processes. Businesses that manage to get the twin engines of creativity and innovation running at full power will have the only enduring competitive advantage left.	2003-11-27

The economy may have slowed down, your product innovation has dropped off, growth has been too fast, or execution has been ineffective. According to Amir Hartman, what your company needs is ruthless execution (a term Hartman coined with John Sifonis while working with Hewlett-Packard). This consists of the method and strategies that Hartman's research suggests business leaders have employed to break through performance walls. <br />Ruthless execution consists of strategies organized into three categories: leadership, governance, and critical capabilities, each of which contains several practices. Hartman does not guarantee success in breaking through the wall if you use any of these strategies. But these approaches are common to those who have succeeded in the past and were used in the order presented in the book. <br />When troubled or uncertain times arrive, leaders typically but fruitlessly adopt either the \\"Run-and-Gun strategy\\" or the \\"Slash-and-Burn\\" strategy. According to Hartman, a third approach of ruthless execution works far better for most business leaders. In this book, he has no interest in identifying the major causes of companies hitting the wall. No matter what the cause it is an inability to focus and execute that is at the core of the problem. <br />By studying a diverse set of industries and companies of all sizes, using surveys, company documents, research reports, publicly available financial data (10-Ks), and interviews with key business leaders, Hartman believes he has discovered the practices used by those companies who succeeded in breaking through the wall. Much of the book consists of overviews of these efforts, many of them familiar to business readers, including Jack Welch's time at GE, Louis Gerstner's turnaround of IBM, Larry Bossidy's famous execution at Honeywell, along with Baxter, Novartis, and Cisco.<br />Ruthless execution proceeds through the stages of leadership, governance, and critical capabilities. The first part of the leadership aspect is strategic recalibration: the act of validating the direction and focus a company is going to take. This involves rearranging the portfolio of business initiatives (Hartman offers four rules for portfolio management), assessing how resources are allocated to initiatives, and setting a course while finding a healthy balance between performance and growth efforts. <br />After strategic recalibration, the second leadership practice is devising a business philosophy. Hartman prefers \\"business philosophy\\" to \\"organizational culture\\" because a culture may endure over generations but he is referring to the view that comes from the top and typically is identified with the CEO. He holds up Jack Welch as exemplifying the creation and promulgation of a business philosophy. <br />The second part of ruthless execution is governance. This consists of: Accountability - using a set of \\"alignment\\" strategies; Performance management system - using a small number of critical financial, strategic, and operating metrics (10 principles are offered); Discipline - communicating messages that are consistent, straightforward, and easily comprehended. <br />The final part of ruthless execution is critical capabilities: These are the specific actions that executives drive to break through the wall. They are the three critical skills and delivery capabilities with which business leaders need to be equipped: Productivity management - cost and working capital management, productivity management inc. technology-driven productivity improvement (which is aimed at optimizing, reconstructing, inventing and for which Hartman outlines six principles); Talent management - hiring the best talent and getting rid of underperformers; Focused corporate transactions - mergers and acquisitions, and divestitures. <br />The final chapter introduces a Ruthless Execution Index intended to help executives who want to understand where to improve their ruthless execution. While some executives will find much of the material familiar, the book gathers and organizes many aspects of the execution so vital to continuing and recapturing success.	2003-11-27

The way to succeed is to double your failure rate. That comment by Thomas Watson, Sr. is not among the innovators' words of wisdom in Stefan Thomke's densely informative exploration of technologies and processes of experimentation but it perfectly fits the message. Central to Thomke's message in this book is the idea that iterated experimentation through the use of models, prototypes, and computer simulations is the key to learning and innovation. Getting the key to fit in the lock of increased organizational innovation capability, however, takes some jiggling and struggling. Experimentation Matters details the technologies that can transform innovation but place just as much emphasis on the changes that must be made to business processes, organization, culture, incentives, and management. Thomke provides plenty of detailed illustrations of companies wrestling with these issues, and offers six principles revolving to help companies experiment early and often and to organize for rapid iteration.<br />The first part of the book explains in depth the reasons why experimentation matters for learning and innovation, and how new technologies are affecting the development of both products and services. Thomke shows how the rate of learning is influenced by several factors that affect the process and how it is managed: fidelity, cost, iteration time, capacity, sequential and parallel strategies, signal-to-noise ratio, and type of experiment. Beneath the bewildering diversity of approaches to innovation in different industries, Thomke uncovers six principles that can improve how experimentation occurs: Anticipate and exploit early information through front-loaded innovation processes; Experiment frequently but do not overload your organization; Integrate new and traditional technologies to unlock performance; Organize for rapid experimentation; Fail early and often but avoid \\"mistakes\\"; and Manage projects as experiments.<br />In the final chapter, Thomke looks at how some companies are \\"shifting the locus of experimentation\\" to customers as a way to create new value. This approach, sometimes referred to as \\"co-creation\\", not only raises productivity but helps fundamentally change the sorts of products and services that can be created. Innovation toolkits given to customers need to enable them to iterate through the steps of experimentation, be user-friendly, contain libraries of useful, pretested and debugged components and modules, and they must contain information abut the capabilities and limitations of the production process. In addition to the development of a customer toolkit, Thomke adds four other steps for shifting experimentation and innovation to customers and, very importantly, notes how the creation and capture of value also shifts.<br />One great strength of Thomke's book is the attention given to the managerial and organizational challenges of implementing new technologies such as computer modeling and simulation and combinatorial and high-throughput testing. As other writers have repeatedly emphasized - but many managers have not yet understood - new technologies *must* be introduced only in concert with revised business processes, structures, and management approaches. Iterated experimentation helps learning by increasing the number of failures. But if incentives continue to punish failures, the new technologies will be underused or misused. Financial incentives, organizational culture, and management communications will have to change if experimenters are to feel free to fail at the most productive rate.<br />Thomke illustrates and details the crucial role of organization, process, and management in realizing the potential of experimentation technologies with a range of illuminating cases. He devotes a chapter to these effects in the integrated circuit industry, examines the challenges faced by Bank of America in its bold service experimentation efforts, and shows how managers at Eli Lilly struggled with non-technological aspects of high-powered experimentation in the drug discovery process. A study of experimentation in the auto industry, particularly at BMW, suggests several lessons regarding the reality of technology introduction: Technologies are limited by the processes and people that use them; organizational interfaces can get in the way of experimentation; and technologies change faster than behavior. Thomke also shows how managers can look at projects as experiments, reiterating, refining, and learning from them as they proceed through the stages of design, build, run, and analyze.	2003-11-07

If you're one of the millions of people who work away from the corporate office much of the time you might. Or you might follow a strict routine of showering and dressing first thing. As Cynthia Froggatt argues in detail, non-traditional working practices vary tremendously - but eight principles can help employees and managers alike shape those practices for improved satisfaction *and* effectiveness. Making the change from traditional, regimented working practices to \\"virtual workplace\\" practices can be difficult but the rewards can be great. Froggatt's principles cover the issues thoroughly.<br />To ensure that working away from the office (whether at home, a coffee shop or library, a client's office, or elsewhere) increases productivity without causing anxiety on either side, this book recommends these guidelines:<BR>Initiative: Overcoming the fear of change and becoming change agents - Froggatt provides a checklist for uncovering obstacles to peak performance in the virtual workplace. <BR>Trust: Achieving confidence in the management-employee relationship - this requires doing away with the layers of outdated performance measures. A real concern is the \\"input bias\\" according to which managers evaluate workers more highly based on what they see rather than on what is actually produced.<BR>Joy: Creating a work environment that is enjoyable in atmosphere and attitude. Even if your company is not considering allowing or encouraging virtual work, the points discussed under this principle could help improve your workforce's motivation and commitment.<BR>Individuality - Creating a culture of autonomy creativity versus conformity. Froggatt outlines three types of solo workstyle, effectively demolishing the idea that virtual work equals working in a home office. <BR>Equality - Flattening the hierarchy so cooperation and teamwork can flourish. Perhaps the principle least specifically tied to virtual work, this one promotes the removal of all forms of hierarchy which, ironically, may be less influential for those who aren't often in the office to experience them.<BR>Dialogue - Providing an honest communication forum to inspire and inform. Even more than for regular workplaces, virtual work relies on open, honest communication.<BR>Connectivity - Optimize technological advantages, including employee locale. This principle is all about equipping your virtual workforce to enable people to take full, productive advantage of increased flexibility.<br />Workplace Options - Provide comfort /creative setting for all work locations. Here, Froggatt goes some way to redressing the emphasis on virtual work by stating that both the physical infrastructure of workplaces and the technological infrastructure of online work are crucial to the emerging environment of virtual work. Workplaces of the future are being shaped by six trends, argues Froggatt: Access will become more important than ownership; People will commute less but travel more; Individual choice takes precedence over management control; No more captive audience at \\"the office\\"; More attention to workplaces in the home; Blurring of leisure and work.<br />Drawing on companies such as Cisco Systems, Autodesk, Verifone, The Promar Group, and SAS Institute, Froggatt paints a diverse picture of the ways that companies can help balance work and personal life while enabling knowledge workers with differing work styles to become more productive. The illustrations of each principle help to make clear how you might go about implementing the abstractions. The downside - for some readers - is an absence of real theoretical underpinnings and little attention to the validity of studies cited to support the author's contentions.<br />For example, on p.40, a Nortel employee survey is used to show higher employee satisfaction of teleworkers as compared to the overall Nortel population. We are given no reason to believe that this is a fair or useful comparison. Perhaps the types of workers made virtual were more satisfied to begin with - a before and after survey would be more revealing. Readers may also find that in the author's eagerness to establish the viability and attractiveness of virtual work, the real challenges of virtual work may sometimes have been assumed away too quickly. On the whole, however, Work Naked provides plenty of ideas for those interested in exploring new working styles for 21st century knowledge workers.	2003-10-29

Schwartz isn't just any futurist; he's a kingpin at the Global Business Network and frequently consults to governments and large corporations. Schwartz argues that many of the big surprises ahead can be foreseen if we use scenario thinking to closely examining existing signs. With this point as well as in some details - such as the impact of shrinking populations - Schwartz is in accord with Peter Drucker. This book lays out the dramatic transformation and volatility we face over the next quarter century. The book's scope is wide enough that everyone is likely to find themselves startled and stimulated.<br />In case you read Schwartz's previous work and wonder whether he still believes in \\"The Long Boom\\", the answer is an undeniable and unashamed *yes!* Productivity and accelerating technological advances will return the economy to a long-term path of strong growth. This doesn't mean that Schwartz paints a pastel portrait of the future. We can expect a cleaner environment and opportunities in abundance, but must also anticipate massive migrations of people, declining populations in large parts of the Western world, a confusing and unruly international situation, global climate crises, plagues, and possibly an asteroid strike. Study this book, challenge Schwartz's thinking, and prepare yourself and your business for a wild ride ahead.<br />Schwartz believes that his forecasts and scenarios will stand up to the test of future history better than those of most prognosticators. The reason is that, in the grand tradition of \\"predetermined elements\\" in scenario planning, he is drawing out the implications of events that have already happened. Many of the big surprises are, in fact, inevitable. So why are we continually caught off guard? Schwartz pins the blame on our tendency as decision makers toreact to the drivers of change either with denial or defensiveness. Neither kind of response is effective and both are \\"fundamentally irresponsible\\" as Schwartz puts it. In this book, he aims to help us understand the kinds of inevitable surprises lying ahead, and to suggest steps that organizations can take to thrive.<br />In the author's view, humanity faces greater challenges now than ever before. At the same time we have greater capabilities than ever before. Our greatest challenge is \\"to master our own accelerating power, without being swept away by it.\\" Along with a few other well-grounded futurists, Schwartz has laid down a challenge along with weapons for tackling the future. Inevitably, most readers will read this book and find it both informative and engaging but few will incorporate the resulting ideas for action into their plans. When it comes to these large-scale shifts, *doing* has always been disadvantaged compared to *denial* and *defensiveness*. Being proven wrong about this would be a surprise but, alas, not an inevitable surprise.	2003-10-22
US	53077580	R3NX3Q590JOHAV	1591392721	61423174	Harvard Business Review on Building Personal and Organizational Resilience (Harvard Business Review Paperback Series)	Books	3	4	6	N	N	From trust to combat zones: a few nuggets of wisdom	In today's unstable global environment we appreciate more than ever the virtue of resilience in both individuals and organizations. This collection promises to provide you with the ability to solve problems without the usual or obvious tools and prepares them to improvise rapid responses to crisis. You *will* find enough solid contributions here to justify the purchase, unless you already have the original HBR articles. The pieces range from Robert Galford and Anne Siebold Drapeau's February 2003 \\"The Enemies of Trust\\" back to William Patagonis's \\"Leadership in a Combat Zone\\" from late 1992.<br />These two pieces also hint at the diversity of the collection hidden under the title. Patagonis writes about how he directed the logistics of the 1991 Gulf War. He explains that leading successfully requires a person to demonstrate expertise and empathy - which can be systematically learned and true leaders create organizations that support the cultivation of leadership. Galford and Drapeau analyze the role of trust, finding a disparity between managers beliefs about their own and their colleague's trustworthiness and their lack of confidence in their ability to build trust within the organization. In explaining the disparity, the authors distinguish three kids of trust: Strategic trust, personal trust, and organizational trust.<br />Two of the strongest pieces are Diane Coutu's \\"How Resilience Works\\" and \\"A Survival Guide for Leaders\\" by Ronald A. Heifetz and Marty Linsky. Coutu explains resilience at its toughest as consisting of a staunch acceptance of reality, a deep belief, often bolstered by strongly held values, that life is meaningful, and a well-developed ability to improvise. One weakness of this piece is that the reader is left to figure out how to go about the development process if no crisis forces the issue. Heifetz and Linsky draw on their book Leadership on the Line: Staying Alive Through the Dangers of Leading to explain risk management for leaders in two parts: An externally-focused part offers tactical advice about relating to your organization and the people who comprise it. The internally-focused part focuses on your human needs and vulnerabilities to help you from defeating yourself. <br />The other pieces included are: \\"Leading in Times of Trauma\\" by Jane E. Dutton, Peter J. Frost, Monica C. Worline, Jacoba M. Lilius, and Jason M. Kanov; \\"Crucibles of Leadership\\" by Warren G. Bennis and Robert J. Thomas; \\"The Toxic Handler: Organizational Hero - and Casualty\\" by Peter J. Frost and Sandra Robinson; and \\"September 11, 2001: A CEO's Story\\" by Jeffrey W. Greenburg.	2003-10-22

In this engaging, well-structured, and practical book, Richard Hackman addresses this puzzling gap between theory and practice. Teams should have a richer pool of talent and experience, greater resources, and more flexibility than an individual. Yet a painfully large proportion of teams function poorly, often underperforming the same work done by individuals. Drawing on years of research and observation of teams ranging from music ensembles to airline crews to hockey teams, Hackman illuminates the dark corners of teamwork. Anyone working in a team or leading a team will benefit from reading his book. The author's engaging style comes as a significant bonus.<br />Teams go awry because leaders have focused on the wrong things (such as leadership style) when designing, managing, and supporting teams. Hackman explains why team effectiveness is best measured by the three criteria of a team product acceptable to clients, growth in team capability, and a group experience that is meaningful and satisfying for its members. Team members and leaders alike will benefit from fully appreciating the five conditions that Hackman has found to foster work team effectiveness: having a real team, a compelling direction, an enabling team structure, a supportive organizational context, and expert team coaching - the first three of which are the core conditions.<br />Contrary to \\"cause-effect\\" models of team leadership in which all the emphasis is placed on leadership behaviors and styles, in Hackman's view the central role of leaders is to create and maintain these five conditions. Leaders should not attempt to continually manage a team to *push* it to perform well. They will do better to establish a clear purpose and then make small adjustments at the right times. Consistent with this approach, Hackman warns against the pervasive tendency to assign credit or blame to specific individuals. Taking that perspective blinds those trying to \\"fix\\" or improve team performance to dynamics only evident at a group level of analysis.<br />Commendably, Hackman does *not* present his findings as a *universal* model for teams. His Authority Matrix (p.52) sets out four levels of team self-management. He does not address \\"manager-led teams\\" which have the lowest level of self-management since they are invariably disastrous for well-understood reasons. Nor does he look in depth at self-governing groups which take on all four levels of setting overall direction, designing the team and its organizational context, monitoring and managing work process and progress, and executing the team task. Hackman's model revolves around the most heavily populated middle categories of self-managing and self-designing teams.<br />Don't mistake this group level of analysis for any kind of fuzziness. You will find the book outstanding in the author's ability to combine compelling narrative with a finely-carved explanatory structure. The first condition of having a \\"real team\\" may appear fuzzy, but only until you read chapter 2 in which Hackman analyzes real work teams into four components, each with its own subtleties. As you read the examples and reflect on your own experiences participating in or observing teams, you will see how commonly teams fail to have a real team task (rather than being merely a \\"co-acting group\\"), to suffer from being \\"underbounded\\" or \\"overbounded\\", or to lack clearly delimited authority or inadequate stability over time. On the last element of real teams, Hackman strongly disputes the notion that long-lasting teams tend to deteriorate in performance. The only except appears to be research and development teams who becoming uniquely stale after about three years of stable membership.<br />Despite pushing back against over-managing teams, Hackman finds a crucial role for leadership in setting a compelling direction - the second core element of effective teams. Even here, direction must be carefully limited to ends rather than means. In the very worst teams, a leader sets highly specific means but leaves the purpose completely unspecified. Hackman's example of such a team at a bank will make some of us wince in painful remembrance. This understates the subtleties of Hackman's account, which unfolds in his discussion of the trade-offs involved in setting direction for a team.<br />If this were an infomercial rather than a review, I would say \\"And there's more! Much more!\\" The last section of the book examines imperatives for leaders, including 7 execution skills of team leaders, and how to think differently about teams - the obstacles to improving teams, what it takes, and what it costs those who would attempt the task. If you prefer to test drive some of Hackman's ideas, you might first read his articles \\"The Five Keys to Successful Teams\\" (which covers some of the material in the last two chapters), and \\"New Rules for Team Building\\". You may want to abandon such caution however. Unlike so many books where 80 percent of the text acts as filler, adding little if anything to the initial points, every one of Hackman's chapters will yield an excellent returning on your reading investment.	2003-10-22
US	53077580	R2CQTC08CHP8RZ	1400046890	437487101	The Next Big Thing Is Really Small: How Nanotechnology Will Change the Future of Your Business	Books	4	15	16	N	N	Great reference but a little dull for nano-experts	If you've heard a little about nanotechnology and wonder about possible impacts on your business or your life, this is the book to read. Those who have already read widely on the subject will find little additional value in the book, other than its function as a comprehensive compendium of current development efforts and potential business impacts. The writing doesn't shine and sometimes has a oddly 1950s feel to it - see the chart on p.24 and the old-fashioned language on p.33 for examples. Despite this, the book performs well if you approach it as a current reference guide to the potentially enormously disruptive group of molecular-scale technologies called \\"nanotechnology\\".<br />Authors Uldrich and Newberry devote an unnecessary amount of text to convince the reader than nanotechnology is not science fiction. Those who think it is won't be reading the book, and those who do read it won't need convincing. The upside of this strenuous defensiveness is a wealth of facts and figures for the reader to assess each area of emerging and potential nano-business. The authors draw a sharp line between the more common microtechnologies of today (such as the MEMS sensors that deploy your airbag) and nanoscale technologies that operate at the level of one billionth of a meter. Some approaches to nanotechnology, such as Drexler's vision of self-assembling and replicating nano devices fit this characterization better than many of Uldrich and Newberry's examples yet, oddly, Drexler's name appears nowhere in the book.<br />Ever since IBM scientists woke up the mainstream to the potential of nanotechnology by writing their company's name with 35 xenon atoms (a minute size that would allow \\"IBM\\" to be written 350 million times in the space of a single printed period), developments have come ever faster. This book does a good job of showing both how broad and disruptive are the potential applications, and in outlining the probable sequence of developments. They divide the nano realminto nanomeasurement and nanomanipulation, and the latter into nanofabrication (or nanoscale engineering) and self-assembly then explain why the scale of the technology can affect potentially just about every product and industry including health care, materials, energy, inventory management, computers, agriculture, sensors - anything whose products and processes will be changed by the ability to made precise atomic manipulations that affect physical properties of strength, conductivity, and optical, magnetic, and thermal properties.<br />At the end of each chapter you will find a summary of the \\"nanopoints\\", including general but helpful prompts to get you thinking proactively about this technology. Toward the end of the book, the authors speculate about nanotechnology's affects on the world past the year 2013. For the long-range perspective they recommend tracking NASA, since its needs for stronger and lighter materials, self-repairing systems or materials, low-power equipment, and so on, would all be met by nano advances. For the next decade, however, I would instead recommend keeping an idea on DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). DARPA's model of innovation and its current areas of interest seem far more promising than that of the embattled and backward space agency.	2003-10-22

In their view, the corporation's responsibility is to maximize shareholder value within the bounds of the law. That's a tall order as it is, so resistance to the thought of additional sources of responsibility and additional relevant \\"stakeholders\\" isn't surprising. The writers gathered in this collection of papers from HBR see corporate responsibility less as a burden and more as an opportunity. The opportunity lies in creating new markets, resolving age-old business problems, improving public perception, strengthening brands, and melding the best ideas for governments and nonprofit institutions for doing well while doing good.<br />This collection of eight essays provides a firm foundation in both critical and creative thinking on issues of corporate responsibility and active philanthropy. If the terrain is unfamiliar, the collection's fifth essay - \\"The Path of Kyosei should be a comfortable entry point. Canon's honorary chairman, Ryuzaburo Kaku, sets out five steps along a path toward a \\"spirit of cooperation\\". Practical but still intellectually not so challenging is Rosabeth Moss Kanter's \\"From Spare Change to Real Change: The Social Sector as Beta Site for Business Innovation\\". Craig Smith in \\"The New Corporate Philanthropy\\" sees philanthropic strategies as giving a competitive edge. A similar perspective, worked out in some detail, comes from Michael Porter and Mark Kramer in their contribution, \\"The Competitive Advantage of Corporate Philanthropy\\".<br />Charles Handy takes his turn at defining the extent of corporate responsibility in \\"What's A Business For?\\". A more impressive piece with far more potential payback for the executive reader comes from C.K. Prahalad and Allen Hammond in their recent essay, \\"Serving the World's Poor, Profitably\\". Also of high quality is Roger Martin's \\"The Virtue Matrix: Calculating the Return on Corporate Responsibility\\". For the more philosophical, a challenging and well-presented argument for strong corporate responsibility appears in \\"Can a Corporation Have a Conscience?\\" by the fittingly-named Kenneth Goodpaster and John Matthews. With a couple of weaker spots, this collection succeeds in bringing together some of the best recent thinking on the issue in recent years. To fill in the gaps, be sure to look at the best pieces from other publications.	2003-10-22

Taking that as the foundation for his new book, Reichheld reinforces and updates his message that loyalty in the form of mutually beneficial relationships between customers, employees, suppliers, and investors (the first two being primary) is the key to sustained success. He finds that most companies fail the \\"acid test\\" of loyalty, with less than half of today's employees believing that their company deserves their loyalty. His current book draws extensively on examples to show how executives can put the loyalty effect to work.    You will find some of the usual suspects throughout the book: Harley-Davidson, Southwest Airlines, Dell Computer, Cisco Systems, Intuit, but also some examples probably less familiar: The Vanguard Group, Northwestern Mutual, MBNA, The New York Times Company, and the U.S. Marine Corps. All the cases make for vivid reading, though abstraction-centric readers can greatly reduce their reading time by going straight the end-of-chapter summaries and application tips. However, the case studies and stories show that the loyalty effect can be put into practice in diverse ways and Reichheld keeps his book below 200 pages.    Underlying the diverse aspects and implementations of loyalty, Reichheld has identified six principles: Play to win/win: profiting at the expense of partners is a short cut to a dead end; Be picky: membership is a privilege; Keep it simple: complexity is the enemy of speed and flexibility; Reward the right results: worthy partners deserve worthy goals; Listen hard and talk straight: long-term relationships require honest, two-way communication and learning; and Preach what you practice.    Stated in summary form, these will probably seem obvious. The detailed vision that the author presents of the principles, however, is not always obvious and certainly is rarely observed with any thoroughness. He analyzes each principle into component ideas. For example, \\"play to win/win involves \\"high road strategies\\" which themselves are further analyzed, along with more thoughts about strategic focus, partnerships, and growing from the core. You should find some rewarding insights with little effort in this book.	2003-10-22
US	53077580	R1IW8UXT4RQR9F	0465060536	421348216	Positive Illusions	Books	4	17	17	N	N	Highly intriguing but with some flaws	This popular book expands the message of a much-cited 1988 paper by Taylor and Browne which argues that most of us have unrealistically positive beliefs about ourselves and this is generally a good thing. Taylor argues that good mental health (resilience, persistence, and so on) is related to three key positive illusions: unrealistically positive views of the self, illusions of control, and unrealistic optimism. <br />During the late 1990s these views fit nicely into the \\"irrational exuberance\\" of the times. In the gloomier days from 2001 we might approach the claims more skeptically. The drastic failure of so many celebrated business success stories has suggested that arrogance, over-confidence, and self-delusion were a major part of the problem. Taylor's book presents what seems like a large body of evidence for the view that unrealistically positive self-illusions correlate with mental well-being and success.<br />The book is certainly worth reading both for assessing the implications for your personal thinking and decision-making style and that encouraged by your organizational culture. However, researchers have since strongly challenged the basis of Taylor's work. Some argue that it is mostly wrong while others find that some positive illusions can be beneficial but others are detrimental. The time period and context considered also matter. In discussion groups it was found that those who significantly over-rated themselves initially struck other group members as confident, interesting, and entertaining. By the seventh meeting, however, they were seen as arrogant, irritating, hostile, and generally narcissistic. These \\"self-enhancers\\" maintained the highest confidence and self-esteem yet were more likely to drop out of college. The academic conflict on this issue should be of particular interest to leaders who must inspire, and to those motivating organizations to make risky and difficult but needed changes.	2003-10-10

Of course endorsements aren't always objective, but a strong secondary indicator is the average five star rating from 104 reviewers here on Amazon - quite a feat. This book exhibited a third promising feature before even considering the details: After my initial rapid scan, numerous sticky flags pointed to chunks of text that demanded further reading.<br />The core business points made in this book by management consultants Donald Mitchell and Carol Coles are based on a ten-year study of companies that had grown the fastest over a three-year period. Fortuitously, on the same day that I read Mitchell and Coles' book, I also read \\"What Really Works\\", also based on a multi-year study and intended to identify the crucial factors in sustained outperformance. Comparing the two works is far from a waste of time since their style and approach differ substantially. The Ultimate Competitive Advantage is less obviously rigorous but far more lyrical, full of well-selected and well-related stories of entrepreneurial success. <br />I also endorse Mitchell and Coles' central message: The best-performing corporations are those that constantly review and update their business models to adapt to changing conditions. It would make for an interesting and revealing exercise to compare this thesis with that of \\"What Really Works\\" in which the emphasis is on clarity of strategy rather than business model innovation. Despite a superficial clash, the two approaches may mesh rather well when seen in the appropriate context.<br />The Ultimate Competitive Advantage can benefit executive decision-makers and managers at companies of any size, especially those who need a reminder of the enduring truths of value generation. The book is well organized, with helpful introductory summaries for each chapter, and can function as a Swiss Army knife of methods for almost any situation. If the fundamentals of pricing, costs of doing business, and benefits added seem too dull to read about, you could be missing out on a compelling rendition of core truths of which we too often lose focus.	2003-10-10

In Robert Tucker's latest book on innovation, he compares the current state of innovation to the position of the total quality movement in 1980. Based on our experience at ManyWorlds, I agree completely with Tucker's views about the need for systematizing innovation and with his assessment of how little of this is being done. Our own work in this area indicates that those who lead in systematizing innovation still have the opportunity to pull far ahead of the slower adopters.<br />The goal of this book is an ambitious one: To summarize and condense all the key issues of innovation while showing you practically how to implement a systematic innovation process. Tucker does a fine job of meeting this goal, drawing on his study of the Innovation Vanguard companies. He covers a wide terrain, including the cultural factors necessary for innovation, numerous methods for \\"empowering the idea management process\\", ensuring that your idea factory keeps running, looking ahead to innovate based on what the future probably holds, and how to develop saleable and innovative products. I'm happy to see that Tucker, unlike too many writers on the subject, recognizes that product innovation is just a start. Process innovation and innovation in business model design are crucial. The issues underlying business model innovation are handled well given the constraints of one chapter.<br />You'll find plenty of checklists and summaries, including five principles for driving growth through innovation, 11 ways to improve your firm's culture for greater innovation effectiveness, eight idea management models, 10 guidelines for your own idea management system, and more. At the end of the book, Tucker provides a map for going about starting your own innovation initiative. This is practically an encyclopedia of corporate innovation ideas. It would be instructive to follow up this book by comparing the new book on Open Innovation by Chesbrough as well as digging deeper into business model innovation.	2003-10-10

Peter Drucker has a beautiful mind, forever fresh and overflowing with innovative thoughts. This book, published just as the master of management began his tenth decade of life, shows him at his perpetual best. The text carries with it the sweeping knowledge, deep experience, and astute analysis that a reader might expect from Drucker at this point in his life. But you will find no timid conservatism, no holding on to safe ground here. Drucker has made a lifelong habit of leading the way in business thought and this book confirms that he just can't help himself.<br />In contrast to the typical business book which is 200 pages too long, every chapter and every page of Management Challenges for the 21st Century relentlessly tweaks the noses of bad assumptions while focusing our attention on the future. Drucker pulls together diverse trends and forces to map out the truly new management challenges. His first chapter, \\"Management's New Paradigms\\" argues that organizations (or what ManyWorlds calls \\"business architecture\\") will have to become part of the executive's toolbox, yet we continue to operate on outdated assumptions about the role and domain of management. <br />Fortunately much recent management thinking explicitly challenges one assumption pulled apart by Drucker: The idea that the inside of the organization is the domain of management. This assumption, says Drucker, \\"explains the otherwise totally incomprehensible distinction between management and entrepreneurship\\". These are two aspects of the same task. Management without entrepreneurship (and vice versa) cannot survive in a world where every organization must be \\"designed for change as the norm and to create change rather than react to it.\\"<br />Although Drucker is intent on uprooting old certainties and focusing organizations on constant change, he does not leave the reader without a compass. In the second chapter, \\"Strategy-The New Certainties\\", Drucker says that strategy allows an organization to be \\"purposefully opportunistic\\" and explains five certainties around we can shape our strategy. While other writers have addressed a couple of these, too little attention has been paid to some of the inevitabilities analyzed here, including the collapsing birthrate, shifts in the distribution of disposable income, and the growing incongruence between economic globalization and political splintering.<br />The book's third chapter, \\"The Change Leader\\", gives Drucker's unique perspective on the need for 21st organizations to be change leaders. \\"One cannot *manage* change. One can only be ahead of it.\\" Change leaders have four qualities. They create policies to make the future which means not only continual improvement but *organized abandonment* - a practice still almost unknown in practice. Contrary to typical company reactions, change leaders will starve problems and feed opportunities. For Drucker this means, in part, having a policy of systematic innovation and - in tune with recent calls for new budgetary practices - having two separate budgets to ensure that the future-creating budget is not stopped off in difficult times.<br />Strong as the first chapters are, I found the other chapters of this book even more incisive. The reader may come away with the sense that many of Drucker's points are obvious, but will realize that they only *became* obvious after hearing them. In his chapter on \\"Information Challenges\\", Drucker gives his own, historically-rich, controversial, and provocative take on our current information revolution - the fourth such revolution, he says). <br />The man who coined the term \\"knowledge worker\\" has no shortage of fresh thoughts in the chapter on \\"Knowledge-Worker Productivity\\", and has profoundly important things to say in the final chapter on \\"Managing Oneself\\". Management Challenges for the 21st Century is, of course, essential reading for aspiring manager-entrepreneurs in these confusing times. As for aspiring business writers, I can only say: Read it and weep!	2003-10-10

If you've read their many previous papers and articles, you'll find the contents of this book familiar but will probably be delighted to find all those ideas and more gathered informatively in one place. The authors' audience consists of companies in mature industries struggling to grow - and to grow in a sustainable manner.<br />Inspired by examples such as General Motors, Clarke American, and Cardinal Health, Slywotzky and Wise mix their own thoughts with others floating around the world of business ideas to come up with a strategy they call \\"demand innovation\\". I agree that typical product innovation, while retaining value, is far from the final word in achieving growth. The authors' demand-centric approach instead focuses on the customer's context in using a product or service, and satisfying that with the company's intangible wealth - customer contacts, business models, technical expertise, human capital.<br />If you are like most customers, you have no trouble finding any number of innovative products. Your wish-list of new stuff is probably making your bank balance very nervous. Yet the experience of finding, buying, using, getting support, and other issues that surround the product itself can create enormous frustration. Slywotzky and Wise do us the favor (as businesses and customers) of bringing together a set of opportunities to grow by helping customers reduce complexity and by helping businesses make better decisions and reach their market faster - often a newly uncovered or created market. Some of the methods for companies are ensuring operational excellence, treating growth as a systematic discipline, developing lots of small ideas and a few big ones, mandating growth at the operating level, securing high-level support for growth initiatives, and building your capabilities through acquisitions and alliances.<br />You may not find many of theseideas to be radically new, but that's no reason to ignore this book. The authors have done a fine job of gathering diverse elements of new-growth practices and putting them in a sensible framework of \\"demand innovation\\". Keep this book on the shelf next to you and pull it down next time you get that not-so-fresh feeling about your business and your markets.	2003-10-10

The assignment is a tough one - to provide a compelling, expansive, yet intensely practical guide to getting things done. Bossidy and Charan have nothing against theory and big ideas, but without execution they are worthless puffs of ideation. Even iconic intellectual Albert Einstein, the authors rightly point out, spent ten years developing the detailed proof of his stupendous insight which we call the theory of special relativity. <br /><br />Execution, the link between aspiration and results, seems like a simple matter yet countless corporate corpses demonstrate otherwise. It cannot be left as an afterthought, but must be integral to strategy, is the major job of the business leader, and must form a core element of the organization's culture. The authors refer to these three understandings as the \\"building blocks of execution\\" and devote a chapter to each.<br />Into the breach step Bossidy and Charan to lay out the three core processes of execution. Each of the core processes -  the people process, the strategy process, and the operations process - rise from the building blocks, each the leader needs to be deeply involved in all three. Putting this all together presents a massive but vital challenge to leaders. At its best it embodies a rigorous sense of realism and intellectual honesty. The thoughtful reader might spy an apparent paradox in the book. As the authors themselves note, you cannot truly learn how to execute from a book (although books can help). Nor is experience alone sufficient, for some people never learn. Clearly and deeply focusing on experience is the only route to full understanding of your particular business and people, your own strengths and weaknesses, and the qualities of your organizational culture. <br /><br />Bossidy and Charan have produced a helpful book that points in productive directions and gives examples of good questions to ask. But in the end some readers will feel disappointed by the absence of a distinct recipe or set of instructions. But business leadership is not science and no universal recipe exists to replicate. Nevertheless, Execution nicely counterbalances the predominantly abstract, inspirational, and \\"visionary\\" approach of many leadership tomes. Buy it, read it, do it.	2003-09-26
US	53077580	RK3OXKPJ8QENR	0929652339	166532895	Business Process Management (BPM): The Third Wave	Books	5	31	39	N	N	A brilliant, practical vision of 21st century companies	Over two decades ago in his blockbuster book The Third Wave, Alvin Toffler wrote that we stood on the edge of a new age of synthesis. We would see a return to large-scale thinking, general theory, and the putting of pieces back together. With fortuitous resonance Howard Smith and Peter Fingar position their thinking as the third wave of business process management (BPM), in doing so helping to realize Toffler's still emerging vision. From both a business and information technology perspective, it is almost as if Toffler was the prophet and third wave BPM the fulfillment of the prophecy. For if the contents of this book are to be believed, third wave BPM is the answer to many desperate pleas from the technical and managerial camps who have suffered through the first two waves associated with Taylorism and reengineering. The authors have done a commendable job of writing for both these camps at once. The result may frustrate some in each group hungry for more detail but the book succeeds in conveying the grand scale and promise of this Third Wave vision. These deeper details can be found in a companion book, Business Process Management: New Directions.<br />Third wave BPM has two goals: hyper-efficiency and unprecedented agility. It aims to meet the needs of companies, including a means not only to conceive of new processes but to implement them, the alignment of processes with strategy, turning organizational change into an engineering discipline, and a \\"pervasive, resilient, and predictable means for the processing of processes. Unlike previous approaches, BPM can create a single definition of a business process from which alternative views of that process can be crystallized - for managers, business analysts, employees, and programmers. The authors make one of many excellent points when they note that \\"information processing\\" should, up to now, have been called \\"data processing\\". BPM claims to finally move us from data processing to \\"process processing\\".<BR>BPM isnot just another revolutionary three-letter practice intended to displace all that came before it. On the contrary, one of its multiple strengths is that it synthesizes and extends previous process representation and collaboration technologies and techniques - such as reengineering, EAI, workflow management, service-oriented architecture, XML and Web services, TQM, Six Sigma, and systems thinking - into a unified approach. The entire approach is founded on process calculus, in particular one form of this called Pi-calculus. This author does not pretend to possess sufficient mathematical background to assess this as a foundation in the sense that electrical engineers rely on differential calculus as a foundation. However, the claim could be given added plausibility by noting that the recent field of social network analysis makes use of the mathematics originally developed for quantum physics.<br />Unlike the previous data-centric approaches, BPM's process-centricity equips its adopters to proactively rather than reactively manage change. Included in this is an ability to simulate change and its effects, making the authors' choice of the term \\"top-down\\" perhaps misleading. As Smith and Fingar explicitly say, by \\"top-down\\" they actually mean \\"the ability to model processes simultaneously at all levels in line with business strategy\\". The ability to simulate is tucked away in the last of eight broad capabilities of BPM: discovery, deployment, execution, interaction, control, optimization, and analysis of processes. The authors' understanding of \\"analysis\\" is generous enough to firmly include the synthesis resulting from business simulations. For those executives stung by business process reengineering (BPR) a good place to dip in would be the chart beginning on p.108 that looks at the BPR advocates' reasons given for failure and the third wave perspective as well as the p.118 chart relating BPM to Davenport's Process Improvement and Innovation.<br />While Michael Hammercomes in for repeated hammering, the authors look far more favorably on Thomas Davenport's angle on reengineering. To their credit, they do not present BPM as springing fully formed from their brains but as essentially an inevitable evolutionary development driven more by economic than technological forces. Further helping the reader to place BPM in context, the book explains how this approach relates to and subsumes John Hagel and John Seely Brown's recent work on loosely-coupled business processes. Chapter 7 is devoted to showing how BPM, far from being a usurper, is actually a supporter, accelerator, and amplifier of existing management approaches such as Six Sigma and Change Management.<br />A book this rich in big ideas defies adequate reviewing. In addition to the aspects mentioned here, the authors also explain how to measure the return on process investment, ten capabilities embodied in a business process management system, the three competencies required to build BPM competence, and how to apply Page-Jones' 7-stage model of expertise to BPM implementation, along with four informative appendices. No doubt BPM enterprises will experience difficulties not well anticipated in this book. Yet the skeptical eye of this reviewer cannot help count off the large number of nuggets of wisdom, and the seeming inevitability of this vision.	2003-02-19

This 1981 classic, updated in 1991 with new material responding to questions from readers, continues to provide practical guidelines for executives dealing with each other, with superiors and staff, with customers, partners, suppliers, and government regulators. If you have ignored this as a pop book, take a good look at it. This practical, non-academic, and well-illustrated book does not waste the reader's time with filler. The authors explain the problems that arise from bargaining over positions, presenting an alternative approach. Their method revolves around four elements: Separate the people from the problem; focus on interests, not positions; invent options for mutual gain; and insist on using objective criteria. They offer helpful approaches for situations where the other side is more powerful, refuses to play, or uses dirty tricks. The range of situations in which their approach can be applied is almost limitless. Keep this one close at hand to refer to repeatedly until \\"principled negotiation\\" becomes ingrained and natural.	2003-01-02

In a time when people are more prone to point the finger at corporations and plead the government to \\"fix things\\", Friedman's superb explication of the benefits of truly free markets (which does not include political bribes from Enron) deserves a revisit. Friedman takes on many mistaken ideas about free markets and the need for regulation. Advocates of intervention typically compare an imperfect free market (often a market only partly free but distorted by little-known interventions) to a perfect governmental solution. However, regulators are human too, and lack the disciplining forces of the market. Friedman's penetrating yet immensely readable analysis of a range of issues related to free markets and regulations remains as timely and relevant as ever.	2003-01-02

Most books of applied psychology fall prey to one of two weaknesses: Either they lack scientific content (or over-simplify) or they present solid information in an academic manner that readers find difficult to absorb and apply. Robert Cialdini's book stands out brilliantly from these books. Combining wide and deep scientific scholarship with an engaging, lucid, and personal style, Influence may be the single best work on the topic. The intent of the book is to show how we can understand and defend against pervasive non-rational influences on our decision-making. Of course the same principles could be applied to market products or influence colleagues and rivals either in place of or in addition to genuine reasons. One sign of the range of the book is the fact that Cialdini doesn't get to the famous Milgram experiment on \\"Obedience to Authority\\" until p.208. The book concentrates on several factors that evolution and culture have drilled into us to produce compliance for good reasons, but which can be abused by \\"compliance professionals\\": reciprocation, commitment and consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity. Any reader will find the research results stunning and frightening. Fortunately, Cialdini concludes each compelling chapter with hints on \\"How to say no\\". No matter how intelligent you are, you have undoubtedly fallen for many of these techniques used deliberately or accidentally. How many poor business investment decisions, product purchases, or strategic moves have been influenced by non-rational factors? You have to read this book. Why? Because I've done you a favor with this review and you owe it to me; you can't say you're a rational person if you don't; everyone else is reading it; I'm attractive, friendly, well-dressed, similar to you, and you like me; I'm an psychology expert and I recommend it; and you need to buy it now before all copies are sold!	2003-01-02

Fingar and Aronica have done a commendable job of examining and explaining the changes to business models brought by information technology. The authors tell the reader what they think was wrong with the dot-com economy and what needs to be done to succeed in the high-tech economy in which the major risk is not getting Amazoned so much as getting \\"GE'ed\\". The book straightforwardly delves into the business model implications of electronic marketplaces, peer-to-peer commerce, B2B exchanges, e-hubs, e-services, component-based architectures, m-commerce, collaborative commerce, value chain optimization, and more. The authors agree with a growing number of others, including re-engineering gurus Hammer and Champy, that the key to success now lies in extended business relationships. The book does an excellent job of looking at the new generation of Internet technologies need to enable new business models and processes. You do not need to be highly technically inclined to follow this discussion which helps business leaders understand what they need to do to power ahead in the real innovation economy. One strength of the book is reflected in the subtitle which shows that the authors are concerned not with technology alone but with how it fits together with new technologies and new business models.	2003-01-02

The Tipping Point may appear to be such a book. However, Malcolm Gladwell's excellent articles overcame my resistance and led to the discovery of a book rich in intriguing ideas and details that may indeed explain a surprising range of cultural and market-based behavior. Gladwell makes no hard claims for the scientific nature of his views, although he draws on plenty of published psychological and marketing research. The core idea is that a small but precisely targeted push can create a fashion trend, the outsize success of a new product, or a major drop in the crime rate. Most of the ideas in this book have clear application to marketing, and others to effective decision-making at many levels of business. Traditional economics, which revolves around an idealistic model of rational agents, has done a fairly poor job of providing practical uses for business and has been under attack from more psychologically realistic sources. Gladwell's book is a worthy addition to this corrective literature. <br /><BR>Starting with the compelling story of Paul Revere's remarkably effective nighttime ride warning of imminent British military activity, Gladwell introduces three rules of epidemics explored in depth in subsequent chapters: The Law of the Few (Connectors, Mavens, and Salesmen), The Stickiness Factor, and the Power of Context. The book elegantly and compellingly weaves these rules through discussions of diverse events and cultural epidemics, from New York crime and the revival of Hush Puppies to the popularity of Sesame Street and Airwalk sneakers and the causes of teenage smoking and suicide epidemics. Not every strand of thought of completely convincing, but the quality of discussion is high, assuming that Gladwell has accurately represented the research on which he draws. This book makes for a fascinating readwith a high \\"stickiness factor\\" and probably contains more actionable strategic and marketing ideas than most hardcore business books.	2003-01-02

Covey's perennial best-seller is certainly worth checking out, if you are one of the holdouts. Unless you have ample time, however, rather than reading it cover to cover and absorbing the numerous stories and illustrations, skim it strategically for the main points. Covey surely has a valid point in arguing that organizational effectiveness (the focus of the sequel) depends on personal effectiveness. His 7 habits span both \\"personal victory\\" and \\"public victory\\". A complete reading of the book may leave you impatient with numerous illustrations, annoyed at some sermonizing, and perhaps puzzled by the absence of real people to embody the habits. The 7 habits will seem obvious enough to many readers, though Covey's explication does bring them into focus and conveys their importance. <BR><BR>The 7 habits are: Be Proactive (personal vision); Begin with the End in Mind (personal leadership); Put First Things First (personal management); Think Win/Win (interpersonal leadership); Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood (empathic communication); Synergize (create renewal) - the fuzziest of the seven; and Sharpen the Saw (balanced self-renewal). Which of these you find most useful will depend on your own strengths and weaknesses, though a case could be made for viewing Habit #3, Put First Things First, as the essence of the book. This focuses your thinking on dividing up tasks across a four-quadrant space whose axes are Importance and Urgency. It's all too easy for us as individuals and as leaders to put almost all our time and energy into tasks that are Urgent and sometimes Important. Covey rightly emphasizes the healthy approach of scheduling regular, defended time for activities that are Important but not (yet) Urgent. These activities, what Covey calls Quadrant Three activities, tie in to each of your self-chosen roles (for instance, Strategist, Manager, Leader, Mentor, Spouse, Parent) to form the basic shape of your day and week. You could substitute other vital habits derived from your own experience or from books such as Patrick Lencioni's works while applying Covey's basic framework. In the end, of course, the value of a book like this can be realized not by reading only but by executing the wisdom.	2003-01-02

Hugh Courtney recognizes that traditional strategy approaches do not work well in conditions of significant uncertainty. Traditional tools such as Porter's Five Forces, market research, SWOT analysis, and NPV valuation models work only in \\"level 1 uncertainty\\". Courtney rightly critiques those who see uncertainty in binary terms, instead outlining four levels of uncertainty each of which require different strategic approaches. Level 2 uncertainty (several distinct possible futures), in addition to the traditional tools, can be tackled with scenario planning, game theory, and decision-tree real-options valuation (ROV) techniques. Companies dealing with level 3 uncertainty face a range of futures and need to use additional tools such as system dynamics models in addition to those of level 2. Companies facing confusing level 4 uncertainty, where there is true ambiguity, can use analogies and reference cases and \\"management flight simulators\\" to help make sense of deep uncertainty. In a sharp break with the usual approach, the growing number of companies facing level 4 uncertainty need to think backwards from hypothetical futures to what you would have to believe about the future to support a particular strategy. In addition to the levels of uncertainty framework, Courtney outlines the alternatives of \\"shape or adapt\\" to uncertainty, make strategic commitments now or later, and follow a focused or a diversified strategy. The details of this book may be familiar in many ways, but the overall framework potentially could be highly enlightening for planners who want to use the right tools for the job.	2003-01-02

If you have read and remember the first book, you may find little really new in this one, although a slightly different angle on the familiar material may be more rewarding than re-reading the first. Whether or not you agree with or find useful all of Covey's seven habits, the virtue-based approach of this work can deliver the goods more lastingly than rule-based approaches that fail to change your basic method of operating. Drawing on a heritage that goes all the way back to Aristotle, Covey's habit/virtue approach to life and our priorities allows him to show convincingly that business and ethics can comfortably live together. In the midst of the incredible change continually afoot in the Innovation Economy, Covey's message is to find the principle-centered core in ourselves and our organizations. Principle-centered leadership is the natural outcome of applying Covey's original message to those in executive positions of all kinds. What is the downside to this approach? Only that this means no quick fixes. Principles and habits take hard work and may look less attractive than books offering techniques and gimmicks for improved leadership effectiveness. In the end, managers know that this downside is not real, since the quick tricks either don't work or soon fail. Covey's approach can help you find the stable, guiding core amidst the mad tumble of the business world.	2003-01-02

In this book (in the UK going by the title of Five Temptations of a Manager) technology company CEO Andrew O'Brien has a mysterious encounter with an unlikely mentor on a deserted commuter train the night before the annual meeting of the board of directors. He's in trouble but doesn't understand why. The enigmatic Charlie leads him through an exploration of five \\"temptations\\" that often trip up ambitious executives: Choosing status over results; choosing popularity over accountability; choosing certainty over clarity; choosing harmony over productive conflict; choosing invulnerability over trust. Easily read in a single sitting, this book conveys the temptations effectively in fable form, followed by a summary and discussion by Lencioni. This may not be a comfortable book for some leaders to read. It doesn't let them off the hook for any of a company's problems. The message is timely as CEOs exit failing companies with massive severance packages. If you read only one of Lencioni's books, you will probably find his style further developed and even more effective in his second book, The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive, or his third, The Five Dysfunctions of a Team.	2003-01-02

We all know of groups of excellent individuals who seem unable to work as an effective team. Using the same approach as in his last book, Patrick Lencioni again does a superb job of conveying the elements of potent teams. Most of the book consists of a story or \\"fable\\" about a high-tech company full of top performers who are utterly failing to function as a team. A new CEO is brought in from a different background with the challenging task of melding them into a unit. The story format functions well in conveying the ideas in an engaging, clear, and well-illustrated manner. Following the story, an overview of the model presents the ideas in abstraction for quick reference and for wide application. The five dysfunctions-absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results-seem simple. And they are, yet implementing them, as Lencioni and his fictional CEO emphasize, will always be difficult. Lencioni's overview provides some productive ways of applying the model. Almost anyone who works in a team can benefit from this book. The pleasure of reading it will be soothing in the face of the continuing struggles of team-building-struggles which must be embraced and not avoided.	2003-01-02

The research challenge arises from the difficulty of finding hard data in a soft subject. The complexity of human interactions in groups defies neat categorizations and explanations. The authors of this highly readable volume do better than you might expect. Combining their deep knowledge in the subject with examples from a range of large companies (Shell Oil, Hewlett-Packard, Ben &amp; Jerry's), they explain how this promising aspect of knowledge management and organizational culture can work. Along with stories about communities of practice at various stages of development, the authors succeed in providing a fairly well-developed scheme for these communities and their care and feeding. <BR><BR>A community of practice (CoP) is a group of people who share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic, and who deepen their knowledge and expertise in this area by interacting on an ongoing basis. This book explains the potential value of CoPs, their structural elements, principles for crafting CoPs, analyzes their stages of growth, explores their downsides, investigates how to measure the value they create, and what role they play in community-based knowledge initiatives. It seems unfair to criticize this book, but more detail on how to implement CoPs would have been welcome. The authors have developed a helpful framework for understanding CoPs, illustrated by examples, but the reader will still need to think hard to implement them in a new setting.	2003-01-02

IT is being embedded into a growing range of physical devices linked together through networks and will become ever more pervasive as the component technologies become smaller, faster, and cheaper. These networked systems of embedded computers, referred to by this report as EmNets, have the potential to change radically the way people interact with their environment by linking together a range of devices and sensors that will allow information to be collected, shared, and processed in unprecedented ways. EmNets could be implemented as a kind of digital nervous system to enable instrumentation of all sorts of spaces. EmNets are expected be employed in personal monitoring strategies (both defense related and civilian), combining information from sensors on and within a person with information from laboratory tests and other sources; and EmNets will dramatically affect scientific data collection capabilities, ranging from new techniques for precision agriculture and biotechnological research to detailed environmental and pollution monitoring. <BR>The report expects EmNets to quite possibly dwarf previous milestones in the information revolution. It sees IT eventually becoming an invisible component of almost everything in everyone's surroundings. This 236-page report explores the potential of EmNets and the research challenges they present. It describes the many ways in which these emerging networks operate under unique constraints not present in more traditional distributed systems such as the Internet. A comprehensive, systems-oriented research agenda is presented along with recommendations to major federal funding agencies.	2003-01-02

In this book from 2000, Goleman applies the ideas of his previous book to the workplace. Why should executives bother with this soft stuff? According to research cited by Goleman (see the summary in Appendix 2) almost all of the abilities that distinguished stars from average performers were emotional competencies. While pattern recognition and \\"big picture\\" thinking were correlated with outstanding performance, cognitive abilities in general - above a certain threshold - did not have significant correlation. \\"Emotional intelligence\\" refers to a set of competencies that characterizes how people manage feelings, interact, and communicate. Building on previous work by others, Goleman characterizes emotional intelligence as being founded on five personal and social competencies: Self-Awareness, Self-Regulation, Motivation, Empathy, and Social Skills. Each of these five is further analyzed into 12 personal and 13 social competencies such as Accurate Self-Assessment, Self-Control, Initiative, Developing Others, Influence, Conflict Management, and Building Bonds. <BR>Unlike IQ, we can continue to improve emotional intelligence. Working With Emotional Intelligence is not a how-to book in the usual sense. It will help any executive understand the importance of EI in all its diverse aspects as well as showing examples of strong and weak EI in individual and organizational contexts. Improving is not easy work. Goleman explains the neurological basis of much of EI, including the role of the amygdala (which can make us impulsive and which affects our resilience under stress) and its interaction with the prefrontal lobes (which together also affect the ability to adapt to change), and the role of the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline (which allow us to distinguish good stress from bad stress). Goleman looks at \\"empathic design\\" (p.139ff)and the contagious effects of emotions on groups, among other important applications in the workplace. He also provides a three-page list of \\"Guidelines for Emotional Competence Training\\". Although parts of Working With Emotional Intelligence will strike you as the obvious dressed up with stories, you can extract some important information by scanning through this book. In an age of record levels of job stress (according to an October 2002 study), any words of wisdom on this subject deserve a hearing.	2003-01-02

Over the last few decades, and accelerating as we move into the 21st century, businesses have increasingly shifted emphasis to intangible assets, including brands, patents, relationships, knowledge, and organizational culture. Yet accounting methods and much input into strategy and decision-making have lagged behind this trend. Stewart, author of Intellectual Capital and a Fortune columnist, has produced an impressive book that investigates many aspects of the knowledge enterprise and the role of intellectual capital. The three main sections are &quot;The Theory of a Knowledge Business&quot;, &quot;The Disciplines of a Knowledge Business&quot;, and &quot;The Performance of a Knowledge Business&quot;. The weakness in this range is that it appears that Stewart has thrown in topics that have little relation to the main point of the book. Each chapter, with a few exceptions, can be read separately as they do not build one on another effectively. Some of the chapters are particularly rewarding: Chapter 10 looks at how to support knowledge processes; chapter 12, &quot;The Human Capitalist&quot;, gathers some interesting thoughts on work and pay for intellectual capitalists, and chapter 13 covers several recent views on how to account for intangibles. The book is definitely worth picking through for the many nuggets but would have been improved with a tighter focus and a stronger theoretical framework. Faults are easy to miss and, when not missed, to forgive thanks to Stewart's undeniable talent as an entertaining writer.	2003-01-02

If you are in your forties and have not yet been wildly successful, take heart. John Sperling, once an unhappy 52 year old Cambridge-educated history professor with $26,000 in savings, grew into an enormously successful entrepreneur. Now in his early 80s, Sperling is a billionaire, and heads the Apollo Group, a holding company whose main component is the University of Phoenix (UoP). UoP is revolutionizing access to business education for working adults in N. America and abroad. Rebel With a Cause is Sperling's personal memoir of his long struggle against the educational establishment to found and develop the for-profit UoP, transforming American education in the process. Sperling's background differs from that of many successful entrepreneurs. Born in a backwoods log cabin, Sperling started as a socialist and successful union organizer. Throughout his changing roles, the opportunistic, energetic, and apparently indefatigable Sperling thrived on adversity that would make most give up. In stolid but personal writing, Sperling reveals the details of the endless conflicts and triumphs, up to and including his new fights with the establishment over the legalization of marijuana. Still iconoclastic and entrepreneurial in his ninth decade of life, Sperling is now developing innovative new ventures including the Kronos age management clinics, and Seaphire, a project for developing aquaculture. Good reading for anyone facing adversity as they pursue their vision of something both worthwhile and potentially profitable.	2003-01-02

Ontologies, a term from philosophy referring to the types and classifications of things that exist, recently has become a term of art in the area of business technology design. This book systematically introduces the idea of ontologies and shows clearly and in detail how to apply this conceptual framework for enhanced Internet-based e-commerce and improved Intranet retrieval of corporate information and knowledge. The notion of ontologies first gained acceptance outside philosophical circles among those working on the Semantic Web as a means to enable agents to reason about Web content and provide sensible responses to unanticipated situations. Fensel provides a thorough survey of a range of ontology-based knowledge representation techniques in terms of their applicability to Web-based information exchange. While the first part of the book will be accessible to non-experts interest in the use of ontologies in e-commerce and knowledge management, the second part presents a more technical view on emerging Web standards.	2003-01-02

One significant exception to this assessment comes from the poor record of Barker's identification of existing and coming trends for the 1990s. By now, we can see the weakness of \\"gambling instead of taxes\\", \\"national health care\\" (surely the result of Barker himself falling into a paradigm trap), \\"solar, hydrogen, fission\\" (at least ten years too early), \\"time taxes\\", \\"virtual reality\\", and others that didn't make it very far. Barker, however, is not a prophet but a guide to a more expansive way of thinking about the present and the future. Barker brings philosopher Thomas Kuhn's work on paradigms into focus with clear applications to business and any form of strategic thinking. Definitely merits a quick read by anyone interested in thinking more effectively about the future.	2003-01-02

While you may not find Sutton's ideas especially weird (more like unorthodox and perhaps contentious), when considered together they definitely push the reader to challenge their assumptions about the corporate conditions conducive to creativity and innovation. Filled with gripping stories from far-flung contexts, Sutton conveys his ideas with verve and passion. These are also some of the qualities that support creativity. As Sutton notes, playfulness, curiosity, and zeal are hallmarks of the innovative company culture. Some books are stuffed with stimulating stories but leave the brain empty. Weird Ideas that Work weaves its tales into a rich fabric of ideas. For instance, Sutton makes the vital distinction between routine work and innovative work. Applying the methods of one to the other can only be disastrous. Related to this, Sutton looks at the issue of whether and when to separate innovation efforts from the mainstream organization. He also makes the distinction (which seems to be catching on more widely) between invention and innovation. Whereas invention is rather like science in that it involves creating something truly new, innovation is more like engineering in that it finds new applications for existing inventions. Grab a copy of this book, kick back for a couple of hours, and see if you can come up with another three and a half weird ideas of your own. One of them might just unlock latent value in your company.	2003-01-02

This is ideal as a first book on strategic planning since it provides a realistic, carefully set out action plan for developing a competitive strategy and implementing it to produce results. Even if you have read dozens of books on strategy, the no-nonsense, concise guidance of this book makes it valuable. The book is the result of extensive work by the authors with small and medium-sized businesses. It not only presents the strategy process in admirably clear terms, it provides templates and guidance throughout the process.

However, if you have not read the original, this book is worth reading, in part because it applies its own principles to communicate simply and briefly. Case studies are kept short and the central messages delivered efficiently then reinforced. Trout emphasizes the enormous amount of information and number of choices facing people and the consequent need for simplicity of message, and a clear position in the minds of consumers. Trout uniformly dislikes brand line extension, though he does not deal with counter-examples. The first section of the book, Understanding the Mind sets up the cognitive framework for the positioning approach. The second section, Dealing with Change, helps companies reposition themselves in consumers' minds. The third section, The Tricks of the Trade, goes into some specific strategies for penetrating the noise with your signal. There are deeper and newer books on the subject, but the clear message of this quickly-readable book is worth taking in.	2001-08-26

The 446-page book is a collection of 25 chapters by a variety of authors, each adding a perspective to the scenario learning process. Fahey and Randall explain how scenario learning builds on traditional scenario planning, then follow up with a chapter on integrating scenarios with strategy. Several essays explain basic approaches to constructing scenarios. The next section shows how to apply scenario learning in diverse contexts including industry scenarios, competitive positioning, technology investments, and anticipating new consumer products. The last section details the vital step of managing the organizational context for scenario learning. Included in this section is a contribution by Kees van der Heijden on the business idea, and Paul Schoemaker on common pitfalls in scenario planning. This book is an excellent resource on the practical use of scenarios in business strategy. It mostly avoids overcomplicating the process as some other books have done, and it focuses on practical strategic implementation, not scenarios for their own sake. At a time when the New Economy continually throws up surprises, looking ahead with scenario learning is more timely than ever.	2001-08-26

Yet, as he goes on to show convincingly, that which is obvious has rarely been practiced. When you read Godins thoughts about permission marketing and ideaviruses, they may sound obvious yet almost all marketers continue to throw huge sums of money at old-fashioned interruption marketing. The infamous peak of this was the spurt of expensive Superbowl ads by transient e-tailers. <br /><br />Like his previous book, Godins Unleashing the Ideavirus entertains the reader while successfully setting off bursts of ideas along the way. Rather than marketing at the consumer, Godins approach seeks to maximize the spread of information from customer to customer. The book provides the expected examples of successful ideavirus marketing, then develops a recipe for concocting your own ideaviruses. In order to show how to make your idea infectious, the book examines what makes a powerful sneezer, how hives work, and applies the concepts of critical velocity, vector, medium, smoothness, persistence, and amplifiers. As Godin shows, the now-familiar idea of viral marketing is one very specific form of ideavirus marketing. Most businesses will not be able to engage in true viral marketing, but all can use the ideavirus approach. <br /> While you may finish Unleashing the Ideavirus thinking that you really did not learn anything drastically new, it is unlikely that you will feel that youve wasted your time. Godin has once again written an enjoyable book that cleverly packages important ideas that have obvious practical use. Any book like this that causes the reader to continually stop and rapidly jot down ideas to implement is well worth the hour or two it takes to read.	2001-08-26

These two books have also been updated and integrated into Moore's latest, Living on the Fault Line. Crossing the Chasm, like the other books, is about and for marketing within high-tech enterprises. Moore's view is that high tech products require marketing strategies that differ from those in other industries. The \\"chasm\\" is the gap between sales to technically literate buyers and mainstream buyers. Moore's book provides well thought out strategies for bridging this gap. Moore disputes the prevailing view that rapid mainstream growth can follow continuously from early market success. Quite different strategies are needed and Moore provides them, illustrated by examples of companies and products that have successfully crossed the chasm. This is well worth reading, though if you read only one book by Moore, make it his latest, Living on the Fault Line.	2001-08-26

The book's popularity came from its great usefulness as a training and counseling guide. Many business people are at least passably familiar with the Myers-Brigg's personality typology. This book updates and expands on the previous book, while remaining highly readable and more practical than ever. Myers and Briggs distinguished 16 personality types. Keirsey maintains this typology but groups them into four categories: the Rational (NT), Idealist (NF), Artisan (SP), and Guardian (SJ). These may not be the only possible groupings, but a great many readers have found these personality groupings to illuminate overall personality and temperament types. Keirsey has added four kinds of intelligence (tactical, logistical, diplomatic, and strategic) to the Myers-Briggs framework, with each of the personality types having a different balance of these abilities. <br /> In a business environment, this book can improve understanding of other people in your organization. By taking the Keirsey Temperament Sorter and the Keirsey Four-Types Sorter, you will gain a better understanding of your own strengths and weaknesses. Once you have understood this framework, you will soon find that you can quickly identify the personality types of people with whom you interact. This can be an advantage in a competitive situation, as well as in fostering intra-organizational cooperation and communication. Many executives are already familiar with communication barriers between technologists and managers. This book provides a detailed perspective to recognize these and more subtle differences in perception, emotional responses, and cognitive style. One beneficial result of absorbing this book is an enhanced appreciation of the differences between individuals. Rather than seeing differences as a problem, this framework enables you to combine differing strengthswithin a team to form a more effective whole. We all know that each of us has strengths and weaknesses. This book helps identify them with more precision and offers insights on optimizing communication between the types. As with any intellectual construct that classifies human beings, a degree of skepticism is called for. This typology is not set in stone and there is a danger of being too quick to mentally fit an individual into one of the four temperaments or 16 types. Nevertheless, this is probably the most plausible and usable personality typing system available. This book can help everyone in an organization take practical steps to follow the frequent managerial exhortations to work as a team.	2001-08-26

Rather than filling out a theoretically weak book with numerous examples, or building a detailed theory which cannot be applied, Moore has produced a brilliant work of practical business theory. Drawing on and extending his work in Crossing the Chasm, Inside the Tornado, and The Gorilla Game, Moore looks at various stages in the development of businesses, how to manage for shareholder value, how to create and sustain competitive advantage, and how companies with diverse cultures can effectively overcome the innovator's dilemma.

Not that this is a bad thing. Powerful criticism of warped thinking and its implementation in strategy and business processes can be highly valuable. The usefulness of this book's criticism of \\"info-enthusiasts\\" would have been heightened had the authors presented a clear, actionable framework for implementing their thoughts, but this is frustratingly lacking. Early on the authors target Alvin Toffler as a prime representative of those who see everything through the lens of information. This lens produces a tunnel vision that shuts out social practices and other aspects of life that the authors insist cannot be reduced to information. Toffler provides an ideal target, explicitly presenting his \\"6-D vision\\" of demassification, decentralization, denationalization, despacialization, disintermediation, and disaggregation. These six forces, according to Toffler, have been unleashed by information technology, and will break down society into its basic constituents of individuals and information. Whether or not the authors are overly harsh on Toffler, their book does a superb job of showing the shortcomings of an entirely infocentric view. <br /> In eight chapters, Brown and Duguid explore the limits to information and to the reductive focus on it, the limitations of software agents or \\"bots\\", the mistakes in thinking that information technology means the end of the traditional location-based workplace, the dangers of re-engineering around information processes without considering social practices and communities, and the limitations of info-centric thinking about learning, organizational innovation and knowledge management, and education. <br /> All of this is well worth reading and paying close attention to. Yet this reviewer got the feeling that the authors often set up straw men to more easily make their points such as taking the most extreme statements of information technologists and futurists then presenting them as universal views among those groups. In some places they weave their arguments out of flimsy material that makes for a good story rather than for solid evidence. For example, they tell the story of how the scent of vinegar on old paper revealed information not contained in the words themselves. The point is well made, but the reader is left wondering how broadly this applies and why the authors do not mention information technology that at least attempts to achieve similar results (such as versioning, and meta-commentary Web tags). Some of the shortcomings of the info-centric view may also result from the immaturity of the technology. Certainly the authors have strong points about the value of physical proximity, though many workers are already finding technologies that allow remote work, and as broadband and eventually virtual reality become pervasive, more of the social cues currently missing may return to our tech-mediated interactions. Overall, this is an important book that identifies a real problem in thinking. In an infotech-saturated world, the authors may be forgiven for going too far in the other direction.	2001-08-26

Originally published in 1998, Dent's relentlessly optimistic book will turn off some sober readers by his somewhat breezy style and dramatic and sweeping claims. Yet, much of the foundation of this book's case for a prolonged economic boom lasting until 2009 in the U.S. (and later in some European countries) lies in respected academic work such as the books Generations, and The Fourth Turning. Dent's message boils down to an argument that predictable generational spending waves coming with a combination of generational innovation and implementation will combine with a range of information technologies and biotechnologies to propel a sustained boom. The current downturn does not refute his thesis, unless it becomes protracted.<BR> The Roaring 2000s is aimed at a general readership, including anyone wanting to understand the major changes ahead and how to take advantage of them. Dent makes some dubious assertions, perhaps over-applying his driving forces, so the book needs to be read with a critical eye. Still, the major forces behind his claims seem to be real and compelling. Business strategists who skim this book may find that it makes sense of the current turbulence and helps them plan for the decade ahead. At the very least, Dent's irrepressible optimism can only do you good in today's gloomy business conditions.	2001-08-26

The four main sections cover knowledge as related to the individual, the organization, strategy, and the economy. The authors include such luminaries as Edward O. Wilson, W. Brian Arthur, Blur co-authors Stan Davis and Chris Meyer, and Lester Thurow. Some chapters, such as that by Wilson are fascinating but not terribly useful to the executive. Some of the most interesting and useful chapters are \\"The Knowledge-Based Organization\\" by Christopher Bartlett, \\"The Role of Knowledge in the Connected Economy\\" by Davis and Meyer, and \\"Brainpower and the Future of Capitalism\\" by Lester Thurow. Overall, many of the contributions are frustratingly tantalizing but ultimately yield little actionable information. This problem is not limited to the academic contributors. Although somewhat abstract, Stephen Denning's piece on how the World Bank applied knowledge management details their three-part process, their 7-part definition of knowledge management, and their blunders, luck, unexpected lessons, and toughest issues. The topic of knowledge management and knowledge processes certainly is important, but most of the chapters of this book fail to show how to implement it. The exceptions are well worth reading. The remainder of the book can be quickly scanned for an overview of current (2001) thinking on the subject.	2001-07-18

Change-management specialist Susan Annunzio provides a five-step process for transforming established cultures and structures to enable flexible and fast-paced leadership. The author starts off with observations about the differences between the Baby Boom generation and the X and Y generations. This does serve to focus executives' attention on improving communication between diverse backgrounds, though it inevitably overgeneralizes. <br />A core part of her book revolves around the 20/60/20 rule. The top 20 percent of the workforce are the change leaders and high-potential performers at every level of the organization. These are the people who can be spurred to ignite change throughout the enterprise. The bottom 20 percent are the complainers and enemies of change. The middle 60 percent can be influenced by either the top or bottom groups, so Annunzio's strategy is to show executives how to use the top 20 percent to influence the middle group while diminishing the power of the obstructive bottom group. The best chapter is probably chapter 4: \\"Ask the Unaskable, Speak the Unspeakable\\". Through real-life examples and clearly articulated strategies, this chapter shows how to break through fear and open communications throughout the enterprise, allowing real change to begin. Most of the value of this book can be extracted by careful attention to this chapter while skimming the rest for the key points. The easy style of writing and the author's restraint in book length makes gleaning the core points rapid and painless. If you are part of a company where everyone feels trapped with old rules but where no one dares break out of the mold, this is a fine book to read and put to use.	2001-07-18

Kanter has written some good material on how companies need to develop a digital culture. But when you see a book of around 350 pages expounding on this topic, you might be concerned about how much value you will derive from reading. \\"Evolve\\" is engaging and contains the ideas Kanter has written about elsewhere (as in her HBR article \\"The Ten Deadly Mistakes of Wanna-Dots\\"), such as the differences between dot.coms, dot.com enablers, and \\"wanna-dots\\". This book addresses issues of profound importance for organizations attempting to transform their culture, processes, and architecture to take advantage of the Internet. Skimming this book will reveal some useful ideas, but much of the real content can be found in the HBR article. The book is filled with interesting examples and detailed cases of around 25 companies including: e-Bay, Drugstore.com, CNBC.com, and e-commerce venture at Williams-Sonoma and Cisco. Many busy executives, however, may be frustrated looking for the meat amidst the stories. <br />Kanter excels at presenting ideas that may not be particularly new in ways that are innovative and picturesque. For example, the third chapter \\"Lipstick on a Bulldog: Why Cosmetic Change Doesn't Work\\" will make you turn to that page, but you will find mostly company anecdotes. (The best part of the chapter, her \\"anti-rules\\" for success, already appeared in the HBR article.) Readers may enjoy her presentation of business strategy for Web-dependent companies as being like improvisational theater, but will probably agree that the biggest obstacles to change are not technological but grounded in management and employee attitudes. Though the book was published in 2001, it already sounds dated in some respects. Kanter's sharp distinct between dot.coms and wanna-dots no longer sounds convincing. Neither do her observations that unprofitable Internet businesses get high stock market valuations. Kanter's prescriptions for encouraging change may not be as actionable as in some other books and shorter writings.	2001-07-18

The current 1984 edition begins with a helpful introduction by Tom Bottomore. The entire book is well worth reading if you have the time for some substantial thinking about economics, politics, and history on a grand scale. However, Schumpeter's half-century old tome has recently come back into vogue as everyone is picking up his term \\"creative destruction\\". Schumpeter, coming from the Austrian school of economics, focused on processes rather than states, making his thinking different from that of other economists of his time and for decades after. His notion of creative destruction perfectly fits as a description of what is happening in the new economy, as new technologies and business models and architectures are simultaneously destroying old sources of value while creating new opportunities for profit.	2001-07-18

Coase distinguished his work from other economists by focusing on the role of transaction costs-now a common theme in discussions of the new economy. If you read only one of the chapters, it should be \\"The Nature of the Firm\\". Here Coase provides the intellectual foundations for strategic thinking about business architectures, mergers and acquisitions, outsourcing, and collaborative commerce. Some of this work was later elaborated on by Oliver Williamson (see his 1985 book, The Economic Institutions of Capitalism.) Like Joseph Schumpeter, Ronald Coase is an economist whose works from decades ago are now more relevant than ever. While Schumpeter's phrase \\"creative destruction\\" may be more memorable, in the end it is Coase's views on transaction costs and the nature of the firm that may be the more significant (and certainly more readable).	2001-07-18

Out of the many books available on time management, priority-setting, and turning plans into action, this is one of the very best. David Allen's system takes some investment of time to implement but then speeds up decision-making and improves clarity of thought by downloading all your free floating concerns into a well-developed framework of files and action lists. This allows you to focus on your current task without worrying about forgetting something and without losing track of materials needed in the future. After explaining his view of mastering workflow and project planning, Allen shows you how to set up for the process and then has you corral all your \\"stuff\\". You then process this until your in-boxes are empty. He shows clearly how to organize materials for reference and for later action, stresses the importance of regular review, and shows how to keep projects under control. Implementing the whole program requires an investment of time (preferably two full days), though some techniques can be put to use immediately with clear rewards, such as the two-minute rule and the use of special folders for action items that will help you clear your paper and email in-boxes, freeing your mind to focus on current tasks. Highly recommended for busy executives and anyone with a complicated life.	2001-07-18

O'Connor runs his company according to four disciplines which together powerfully maintain the health of the organization's culture. The four disciplines are: Build and Maintain a Cohesive Leadership Team; Create Organizational Clarity; Over-Communicate Organizational Clarity; and Reinforce Organizational Clarity Through Human Systems. While none of this will appear astoundingly new, the message is important and often not implemented. The fictional portrayal is followed by a more detailed analysis of the four disciplines. Most readers will find this a quick and enjoyable read that should ignite productive thinking about healthy organizations. Without a sound corporate culture even the smartest strategies and business models will not work optimally. Definitely worth reading.	2001-01-31

They have found that 90% of strategic initiatives fail due not to formulation but to implementation difficulties. Successful implementation of strategy requires all parts of an organizations to be aligned and linked to the strategy, while strategy itself must become a continual process in which everyone is involved. The Balanced Scorecard, originally seen by the authors as a measurement tool, is now presented as a means for implementing strategy by creating alignment and focus. <br /> Financial measures report on lagging financial indicators. The Balanced Scorecard aims to report on the drivers of future value creation. The book shows in detail how this is done from four perspectives: Financial, customer, internal business perspective, and learning and growth (these are outlined on p.77). These four perspectives produce a highly detailed framework when combined with the five principles of a strategy-focused organization: 1: Translate the strategy to operational terms. 2: Align the organization to the strategy. 3: Make strategy everyone's everyday job. 4: Make strategy a continual process. 5: Mobilize change through executive leadership. <br /> Absorbing every detail of this book will require many hours. The sheer detail of this complex system requires considerable attention, perhaps more than some readers can muster, but clearly distinguishes this work from many books full of business fluff. The style tends to be turgid and pedantic while being admirably complete. Readers can grasp the essence of the book's central points by reading only Chapter 1 (Creating the Strategy-Focused Organization), Chapter 3 (Building Strategy Maps), and Chapter 8 (Creating Strategic Awareness). Skip quickly through the chapters in Part Two: Aligning the Organization to CreateSynergies. This section is the least engaging of the five. The balanced scorecard approach to strategy will appeal to those with a systematizing frame of mind. The book is filled with complex diagrams of corporate processes consisting of interrelated boxes and forces.  <br /> This approach is extremely detailed and complex. It requires a major commitment and effort.  Though the authors claim it can be implemented by smaller organizations, this will be more challenging than for large companies who can commit a team full time to working out the details. <br /> Much of the value of the approach may lie not so much in following through on completely working out the balanced scorecard but on absorbing the lessons regarding organizational integration across silos and the importance of clarity about mission, strategy, and goals. The balanced scorecard is one way to achieve and implement this clarity but not the only way. Another would be continual reiteration of these (as in Confessions of An Extraordinary Executive). Some companies may benefit from strict use of this system, including finding units of measurement for its implementation. Others will gain much from applying the insights without such a formal and complete implementation.	2001-01-30

Bionomics makes extensive parallels with the world of biology to reveal capitalism's cooperative as well as competitive aspects. This book predates many more recent writings that apply biological and emergent order ideas to markets and is still one of the best discussions. As the economy is continually and dynamically driven into new states by technological change, the lessons of Bionomics are more pertinent than ever. They suggest great caution regarding government planning and control of a naturally growing and self-regulating market economy. Government's role is to protect the property rights that allow new economic orders to flourish.	2000-12-15

Recent discussions of &quot;market failure&quot; resulting from network effects or &quot;externalities&quot; have been critiqued by others, especially Margolis and Liebowitz. Cowen's collection digs deep into the economic theory of public goods, externalities, and free riding, as well as providing case studies of the successful private provision of supposedly public goods. Essays include Robert Axelrod on &quot;The Problem of Cooperation&quot;, and Nobel Prize winner Ronald Coase, with a helpful and substantial overview by Cowen. One point running throughout the essays is that new technologies, given clear property right assigments, can solve public goods problems and that this is typically a better solution than government involvement.	2000-12-15

The book does a marvelous job of entertaining the reader with stories and examples of creativity. The authors should be applauded for digging out the buried true details of corporate creativity. (The section on the Soviet Stakhanovite movement alone yields a historical lesson worth the price of the book.) On the negative side of the ledger, I found two major flaws: analytical weakness in discussions of some central concepts, and a relative neglect of how to apply the principles to your organization. The chapter on the relationship between creativity and intelligence exemplifies the book's analytical weakness. The authors cite research claiming to demonstrate the absence of any significant link between risk-taking and creativity. But they fail clearly to explain what they mean by &quot;risk&quot; and do not distinguish it from recklessness. Creativity does require taking risks, even if that means the psychological risks of being wrong, or feeling embarrassed. This chapter does include some surprising and important results. Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation are distinguished then several studies brought out to make the point that extrinsic motivation in the form of rewards encourages people to take the quickest and surest route to a goal, but not necessarily the most creative. While stimulating and important, this discussion of motivation is not entirely convincing. Clearly, intrinsic motivation is the gold standard, but the authors go too far in slighting extrinsic motivation (whether bonuses, stock options, prizes, etc.). The authors offer six principles of corporate creativity: Alignment, self-initiated activity, unofficial activity, serendipity, diverse stimuli, within-company communication. They illustrate each of these with numerous entertaining stories, but the lessons learned and how toapply them are relegated to a couple of pages at the end of each chapter. This book would provide much more value by trading off some story-telling for more implementation planning. Sometimes the authors provide at least a primer on implementing their six principles. For example, they briefly offer five characteristics of a system that promotes self-initiated activity: The system must reach everyone; the system must be easy to use; the system must have strong follow-through; the system must document ideas; and the system must be based on intrinsic motivation. Their first, and perhaps most crucial principle is alignment, defined as &quot;the degree to which the interests and actions of every employee support the organization's key goals&quot;. Yet, despite numerous fascinating examples, the reader is left without much idea of how to ensure alignment. Other books, such as Geoffrey Moore's Living on the Fault Line, do a better job of showing how to align organizations and their cultures in ways specific to their marketplace. Overall, anyone concerned with corporate creativity will benefit by skimming the book, focusing on the end-of-chapter summaries and working out for themselves how to implement these principles.	2000-12-13

You will find nothing here about rational argumentation or logical reasoning. Spence focuses on how to tell a persuasive story, and how to use that to get what you want at work and in other situations. This is dangerous stuff in the wrong hands, but combined with a rational basis it will make your arguments far more compelling, whether you are making a case for a new business project, asking for a raise, or defending your position.	2000-12-07

However, the constant refrain of \\"innovate, innovate, innovate!\\" is hardly new to anyone familiar with works such as Built to Last, and The Age of Unreason. Aimed at anyone wanting to be a business revolutionary, including \\"gray-haired revolutionaries\\" in sleepy old companies, this book offers a few useful ways of thinking and steps to take to shake up your business. However, much of the useful content can be found in Hamel's recent HBR articles, and the excessively breezy writing style triumphs over actionable content. Those most attracted to this book will find the least in it, whereas those most in need of its message will be unlikely to pick it up.	2000-12-07

Sanders does a fine job of compressing the vast intellectual history of science into a couple of concise chapters. She shows how previous physical world views from the Aristotelian to the mechanistic have influenced culture, including business thinking (most obviously with the re-engineering movement). The connection between complexity theory and Sanders' main offering to business strategists appear rather tenuous. The main lesson seems to be that complexity theory helps us to understand the dynamically interrelated workings of the world. The real theme of this book is not complexity theory but the use of visual thinking to gain insight and foresight in a complex world. Although the historical and expository parts of the book are well written and interesting, the main value comes from the second half on using visual landscapes (\\"FutureScapes\\") to assist in strategic thinking. While much of this will not seem particularly novel to those used to using MindMaps and similar techniques, Sanders does systematically lay out a procedure for applying this tool to strategic thinking. Don't expect to learn how complexity theory can directly solve business problem. Nevertheless, the 70 or so pages in the visual thinking section are worth studying and implementing.	2000-12-07

If you haven't thought much about the thinking process and don't have a background in cognitive psychology, this book is well worth reading. If you have, then you'll find it agreeable but not enlightening, though it may remind you of important points that you've forgotten to pay attention to. Wells focuses on flexible thinking and how to ask the right questions. He outlines the strategic thinking cycle: Perceiving, acquiring insight, developing foresight, understanding possibilities, identifying strategic levers, matching levers with capabilities, reasoning, choosing a core strategy, and making the strategy work.	2000-12-07

Ringland's book has the virtue of avoiding these two extremes. This wide-ranging book will suit both newcomers and veterans of scenario planning. Each kind of reader can pick out what they need from the four sections. Part I introduces scenario planning from the point of view of strategic planning at ICL in the UK. Ringland shows how scenarios can be linked to strategic planning and how they can be used for learning or to influence public opinion. Part II take a more theoretical approach, outlining eleven different methods, including those used by the European Commission, Global Business Network, and SRI, as well as computer-driven simulations. Part III presents eight case studies, allowing the reader to see the process as it was applied to British Airways, Cable and Wireless, the UK's National Health Service, and Shell. Finally, Part IV shows examples of scenarios including those developed by the author's company ICL, and MIT's scenarios for 21st Century organizations.<br />Hardly anyone these days has the time to read a 400-page book. Fortunately, Ringland has structured Scenario Planning to make it easy to pick out just what the reader needs. The variety of approaches explained and the range of case studies and examples is like a large menu from which the reader can choose just the tidbits desired. A well-balanced reading of selected chapters will provide all the essential elements needed to understand scenario planning. On the other hand, the book's main shortcoming arises from its breadth. No one approach is explained in sufficient detail to create a systematic and thorough understanding of any particular method. Such detail can make for tedious reading and may be unnecessary. But if you want to drill down to minute details, skimming Ringland's book will be a great warm-up before tackling Van der Heijen's book.	2000-12-07
