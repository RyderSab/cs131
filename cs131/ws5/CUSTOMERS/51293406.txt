What a moving story about love and the impact it can have on women, when they are faced with loving a man who's imprisoned. I found this book to very interesting and it anwsered questions, I have about women in that sitaution. It made me question how far I would go for the man I love and what it would mean for me as a woman, wife, mother, etc. I applaud asha for sharing her beauitfully told story and love affair with Rashid. She needed a man like Rashid at that point in her life and he was a blessing. The book shows how she allowed hereslf to see herself in a whole new way, thanks to the bond they shared. He seemed to empower her and he helped her shed some of her own demons. How beauitful is that. Being with him enabled her to grow in strength and spirit. I thought the story was richly-woven and is worth sharing with others. I couldn't wait to tell people about the book. I look forward to reading more from this strong-powerful sister. Thanks for beauitful story that focused on love and it's true power asha.	2002-08-16

I recently completed reading Homecourt Advantage and found it to be a very interesting. I thought it was very refreshing to have a sort of inside view as to what it's like living the life of a basketball star and what it's like for their spouses and families as well. After reading and hearing some of the gossip that surrounds some of the players, I was wondering when someone would spill the beans so to speak. Well, these two NBA wives did a beauitful job of telling some stories without being trashy about it. Being a avid basketball fan and female, I found it sickening and sad that some of these people still weren't happy as people. Some were straight ruthless and others were just plain weak. What had me on edge was how they thought money was the answer to everything no matter what and how they tried to use it in every situation. As I read about complex characters such as, Casey, Remy, Brent, Rick, Lorraine, Kelly, Coach Mitchell, Trina to name a few, I found myself trying to match them up with the real life person. Changing the teams name to the Flyers was clever and Rita Ewing/Crystal McCrary did a wonderful job of writing this story in such as short time. The story was creative, vivid, entertaining. Basically it's worth the read.	2002-03-20

I just recently completed Bernice McFadden's second novel, The Warmest December. What a compelling, heartbreaking, gut-wrenching story, that's sure to pull at your heart strings. Page after page, I couldn't imagine what would happen next. My heart ached for the Kenize and Malcolm Lowe and the pain they had to endure from their abusive father Hy-Lo(Hyman Lowe)There were times when I thought how could anyone be that cold-hearted and mean-spirited and then you meet Gywenth Lowe, his mother and their grandmother,who passed the genocidal traits down to her sons. What enraged me even more was that their mother Della, had the opportunities time and time again to save her children and herself as well but, sacrifices it all for what she values. Her own mother couldn't convince her, she was playing with fire. Her confession at the end of the book, was truly a shocker but, gave me some type of understanding as to why they endured so much pain and heartache at the hands of a mad-man. I found that even in those situations of domestic abuse, women try to convince themselves and others that, they're loved, well-cared for, etc. This story gives insight into the lives of abused children and all they suffer as children and possibily adults. You see the toll that it takes on other family members and friends of the family as well. Berince did a beauitful job bringing such a touchy subject to light and giving Kenize Lowe the strenght to share her story with the reader. Bravo!! Bravo!! Bravo!!	2002-02-05

Over the Thanksgiving holidays, I had the opportunity to read Rosalyn McMillian's This Side of Eternity and I have to say WOW!! This book keeps you on edge and shocks you in the process. I tried to guess what would happen next and oftentimes couldn't. The story is set in Memphis,TN. during the late 1960's. The era was during the Sanitation Workers Strike and the assassination of Dr. M.L.King. Two powerful moments not only in American history but, also the history of the city and state. This is the first book Rosalyn has written that wasn't centered around Detroit and she did a wonderful job.She pays so much attention to detail and makes you feel as though you're a part of the story. She focuses on the Russell family and their cursed lives so, it would seems. They struggle to overcome pain, heartache and tragic situation after situation, only to be faced with another. It's enough to make you scream. The family shows great strength and courage as the book progresses and you become overjoyed for them. I was pleasantly pleased with the book and enjoyed the mix of romance, fiction and mystery.	2002-01-16

After completing Renee Swindle's, Please Please Please, I couldn't wait to do my online review ... I found the book to be surreal, dramatic, an eye opener and redeeming read. My heart went out to Babysister because of the lack of self-love she had for herself. She was looking for love in all the wrong places. I kept praying for her to redeem herself and find her true passion in life. She seemed so lost from time to time. Even with the love and support and her father, Deborah, Rob, Lisette, Sherice and Darius and Jorge. Her weakness? One word, Darren. He was a true piece of work and took the statement, \\"all men are dogs\\" to a new height. This proves that year's of friendship, trust, honesty and love should be valued and treasured. Bestfriends have a \\"special\\" bond that's more like family. I'm glad Babysister learned that lesson, even if it took the most shocking moments of her life for it to come to light. Sometimes it's a hard pill to swallow but, water can make it easier. She needed to grow-up and while reading this book, you see it happen before you eyes with every turn of the pages. Renee did a wonderful job with her first novel and I look forward to reading her second novel upon it's release. I hope she'll give us a part II to this wonderful story for sure.	2001-09-06

I just completed E.Lynn Harris' newest novel, Any Way the Wind Blows and I must say it was all that. I couldn't put the book down. Basil never disappoints E.Lynn fans and that Yancey Braxton is too much but, the ultimate players in this book were Ava Parker Middlebrooks and Bart Paul Dunbar. Adding Bart to the mix made Basil look like a drop in the bucket. I couldn't figure this guy out for nothing and the things he says and does are enough to scare anyone near or far. Ava is the same she-devil, we've come to know, love and hate all in one breath. E.Lynn is a master in his own right. No one can do it better. I was left wanting more and more. The book was magical and in my book is another bestseller. Any Way The Wind Blows will have you on edge and have you believing that the wind can and will blow any way.	2001-08-31

What a powerful, surprisingly shocking and beauitfully woven story centered around Idlewild, Michigan. This book shines a spotlight on Joyce Mitchell the older sister of Ava and introduces us to people like Nate, Nikki, Tomika, Shelia, Sister and Bill, The Smitherman twins and the infamous Lattimore family. I was delighted that Pearl dedicated a book to Joyce and allowed her to share more of herself with us. It was a gratifying and wonderful book to read and well worth sharing with others. Joyce is a strong and remarkable woman, with so much to give and offer others and she does just that. The story is even laced with some comedy so, it's not too deep and heavy for you. While reading it I found myself rethinking various key moments in my own lifetime. Or as Oprah says, those light blub moments. This book has a liitle something, something for everyone and it's sure to be a book you won't soon forget. Happy reading and thanks Pearl for another delightful, life-changing and powerful read.	2001-08-22

My heart went out to 11yr.old twins Alisa and Ariana, who longed for the love and acceptance of their mother,(Catherine)Who's a piece of work, in every true since of the word. It's a story that celebrates the love, compassion and friendship that surrounds them from not only their father Terry, who's raised them since birth but, also from their extended family Roland, Jackie, Michael and Michelle, Mercedes, Momma C, Teresa and Veronica. The love they share amongst themselves is so powerful and inspiring to say the least. The inner strength each adult possess and passes on to the other was so touching and loving to. They're all wonderful and beautiful examples of what it means to be a family. What it means to love one another unconditionally. This story restores faith, hope and love in a very touching way and makes believers of non-believers. I look forward to sharing this book with my daughter, family and friends.

With yet another bestseller EJD has definatley done it once again, in what has to be one of his most risky and brilliantly written book yet. I couldn't put this one down!! Eric stayed true to style but, added some red hot spice to the pot. The interesting mix of Nicole, Ayanna and Mr.X(SMILE), was very edgy and racey for Eric and a true delight. The storyline was exciting, dangerous, surreal and beauitful all in one. I also found it interesting to see how the choices one makes affects their life, with family and friends and ultimately their lifestyle. How damaging the end results can be and how important it is to be true to others and most importantly yourself. How forgiveness and redemption can set you free from the emotional baggage we sometimes carry, hide and harbor. It was wonderfully written and well worth the money and read. I will read this one again and could'nt wait to share it with others. I'm sure many will find it to be a page turner and will be talking about the latest EJD hit blazin'up the literary scene. BRAVO!!

Terry does a wonderful job describing the realtionships Lewis, Janelle, Paris and Charolette each have with their mother and how it has molded them into the people they've become in their adult lives. What I truly loved is how Terry gives you the opportunity to see each of her children through her eyes. You find out how she feels and thinks about each of them on a personal level. Somepeople never know how their parents truly see and view them. I found that refreshing and a rare treat. She also shows how a father, Cecil can become lose and looked over in a family. But, he comes to see that it's not too late to build new relationships with each of his children and to start a new. I found Viola, the mother to be strong, sometimes overbearing and a &quot;true&quot; pistol. What's even funnier is the fact that, my mother-in-law bares the same name and some of the same qualities. I felt as though, I had lived this story before. It was simply surreal. She(Vy)surely added flavor to the pot. It was like reading about my in-laws and then some. I knew exactly who was who, in this turner. I laughed, cried, shouted and gave my amen's for sure and even found myself reaching for tissue. A Day Late and A Dollar Short, helps you see, what matters most in life and why. It pulls at your heart strings and makes you want to reach out to people and cherish what you have. This latest McMillian book was well worth the wait, though I pray it doesn't take her as long the next time around. Yes, I'm a &quot;BIG&quot; Terry McMillian fan and always will be. She and her sister have a way of doing for me. Though their writing styles differs, that's what makes it all the better. I'm eagerly awaiting the next bestseller,Terry and continued success as always.	2001-04-15

I still enjoyed the novel and it was worth my time. We even had a great book club discussion on it. The book uncovers some dirty little secrets from the past and how they can comeback to haunt you, when you least expect it. Dana and Vince can atest to that and they seem right for one another, from the moment they meet. But, they're love is tested and must be strong enough to survive the roadblocks such as, an ex-wife and ex-lover. Dana helps Vincent battle with being an absent father and he proves to be the big man she needs to get her through her on nightmarish past. Together they learn how to love and what it means to truly be in love. They come to understand that honesty and love hold the key to their future. It was great that they had friends such as Gerri and Womack to add a little spice to the pot. Gerri was too much and had me in stitches most of the time. This was a refreshing book, that mirrors so many lives. Eric must have been a fly on the wall somewhere.

I enjoy her books because, they take me back home to Detroit. I can picture everything and feel like a part of the story. Rosalyn has that magic in her pen when it comes to writing about home and what it has to offer.    Issac's character was battling some serious demons and trying to put his family back together. I cheered for him from the start. It's not easy for a man to deal with all that he did. I knew he was a fighter and deserved a chance to make things right. I'm glad he found himself. Set himself free and was able to mend broken fences. I cried as he ached for a relationship with his only child, Peyton and his wanting to reunite with Kennendy. It was touching when he and Miracall Lake came to be friends and lovers after their shared tragic past.     Kennedy left a bad taste in my mouth for the most part. She gave Isaac such a hard time and acted as though he wasn't trying to changing his old ways. Boy, did she found this out too late. I will say, I admired her strength and determination to better the lives of both she and their son-Peyton. She'd had to do what so many mothers and wives have to do when there's not a responsible man around. My only problem was that she lead Issac on and it greatly affected their relationship as well as others throughout the book.     Rosemary, Jesse, Paps and a few others add more flavor and drama to the storyline. Hats off Rosalyn once again!!	2001-03-29

I enjoyed seeing how it all started for him and I wasn't disappointed in the least. I read the book in 2-3 days and hated that I finished it when I did. I've been a fan of Eric's for awhile and never seem to be disappointed with his books. I find it refreshing that he can write from a male/female point of view and he does it so very well. Sister,Sister opens the door to the saga that carries over into almost all of his books. You see just what somepeople will do to be in a relationship or so-called one anyway. Eric shows us, how some are blinded by the &quot;thought&quot; of love and how it can make you think and do some crazy things, in the name of love. The story was funny, witty and edgy. Just like I like them. Each page left me hunger for more. Much more. This one is a bestseller in my book. I thought it was clever that Cheaters filled in the blanks and cleared up somethings for me. Eric is an awesome writer and I turn people on to him every chance I get. If you haven't experienced him yet what are you waiting for? Forever a EJD fan and awaiting the next bestseller ALWAYS.	2001-03-29

I recently read Michael Baisden's, The Maintenance Man and found that I couldn't put it down. I completed the book in 2DAYS!! It was just that good!! Simon, Teddy Bear and Malcolm are three men who, give us an upclose and personal view into their troublesome, different and oftentimes very complex lives. While reading you come to see how each of them values relationships, how their past can comes back to haunt them,what it truly means to be in love and the obstacles they must overcome to get the happiness and love they want, deserve and need. This book gives it all up. You laugh, cry, fuss and cheer as you breeze through it. While reading you get a feel for Atlanta, Louisana, New York and the various places throughout the book. You feel a part of the scene. Malcolm was my favorite I must admit and the most complex of the three. My heart ached for him as he struggled with his demons. Thank goodness he had his mother and Simon. Still there did come a point when he got what he deserved and I was glad about. What I found refreshing was the addition of Cythnia and Toni. These ladies really helped to add a little drama to the pot. Well worth the read and great for discussion.	2001-03-24

What's great is how each carries different views and just how different they truly are, even though they're bestfriends. They even struggle with keeping their own relationships with one another together. I was overjoyed by strong women like, Tracie and Angela and the support and comfort they gave. Valarie was a trip and had me scared for Erikah to. The locals were vivid and had me feeling as though I were a fly on the wall. Mike B.detailed the book very well. I felt he gave up too much detail in some parts of the book and he left me with a two-part question. What happened to Valarie and did Tony get Erikah or what? It as refreshing to read about men and their &quot;DRAMA&quot; for a change. Michael Baisden sure knows how to give it. He's the Terry McMillan of fiction, in my opinion.	2001-03-24

It was wonderfully written, powerful and so insightful. A true page turner from beginning to end. I hated to see the book come to an end. I could see bits of myself in Zuma, Pat and Faye. My heart went out to Pat and her hubby Mark as they longed to be parents. I cried for Faye and her family and the obvious pain they were all dealing with silently. The hard nose Zuma won me over after awhile and had me in stitches as she battled with that D-O-G Taj and anyone else who tried to cross her. She displayed so much courage in the mist of her own private hell. Sandy left a bad taste in my mouth. I found it hard to believe that she, could be so cold toward her own children. The way she refers to them, cares for them and talks about them was so dishearting for me. Oftentimes, I was brought to tears throughout this book and I look forward to reading it again and passing it onto others, Who I'm sure will enjoy it as much as I. While reading this book and afterwards, I found myself looking in the mirror and re-evaluating myself as a woman, wife, mother and friend. It made me think about the choices I've made in my past and the effects and impact they on my life.<br />  I look forward to reading other books by Sheneska Jackson and I'm sure they'll be just was powerful. In my opinion, Blessings, is a bestseller and touch and move many women and hopefully men, in the years to come. I'm heading to the store to buy extra copies for friends and family.	2001-01-18

Affirmative, Renewing and Powerful story	I read this back when it was first released by Ms.McMillian and had the pleasure of meeting my homegirl back in Detroit,MI. during her book tour. It's a moment I'll never forget. She's an awesome woman and a powerful  writer. Terry takes you on a reading journey that's sure to leave an  impression on you for days, weeks and years to come. I've been a fan of  Terry's for years and eagerly await each of her novels.<br />   In this story  Stella Payne is in search of a renewed life. She's a successful Black woman  and a single mother of one. She's decided to take a trip to Jamaica to  center herself and gain a new lease on life. However, when she meets a  younger Jamaican born Winston Shakespeare her life will never be the same.  She in for the ride of her life with a man who sees beyond their age  difference. Winston shows her a new way of seeing life and it's  possibilities. The love they share is AWESOME and HOT! This is a refreshing  story about a younger man longing to love and be with Stella, who's an  older woman. It a celebration of love. <br />  What I loved about the story  and movie was the beauty shared by Stella and Winston. Their story shows  that love can survive regardless of age. I also enjoyed it because so often  we hear of older men with younger women and their stories run like a flood  gate. How Stella Got Her Back lets us know that older women are glorious,  beauitful and &quot;ALL THAT.&quot; This story shows us that older women  can be just as, if not more beauitful than their young counterparts. I  applaud and celebrate these women for their true beauty and integrity.  Thanks Terry for giving a voice to these women and men and their love.	2000-07-20

My book club The Sistah Circle Book Club read this book back in November(1999) and we all truly enjoyed it. It was surreal, refreshing and very touching. Both DeBerry and Grant are a breath of fresh air in the  literary world and I'm on pins and needles waiting for their new novel, due  for release later this summer.<br />  This novel sent me on a journey from my  own childhood to the present. It helped me to see that the choices we make  or have made for us can greatly affect our lives and the path(s) we choose  to take. This story also showed how lies and secrets can  and will hurt and  at times can kill when you least expect it. It celebrates a precious 20  year friendship, that's more like a sistahood between Patricia Reid and  Gayle Saunders. Then there's the tragic day after school that changes not  only their lives but that of their other friend-Marcus Carter. As they all  grow and go on with their lives they realize love will see you through it  all. I look forward to reading this book again and again. I've recommended  this book to my sister-Joi, countless others and a woman in the bookstore  who bought on &quot;the spot.&quot;	2000-07-20

The book tells the story of a family troubled by their past and  secrets and how elders of a family can hinder your growth as individual.  How you can pass your fears onto your own family members and keep them from  truly living their lives. Mama Day is a renewing story of power, faith,  courage and strength. How we can overcome the fears of our past and move on  to true earthly glory. The story focuses on the Day family, Mama  (Miranda),her sister Abigail and Cocoa. Black women who's family has owned  an island that borders Georgia and South Carolina, since 1891. They live  simple and at times very eventful lives on this island, along with other  local residents such as Bernice and Ambush, Dr.Buzzard, Ruby, Junior Lee,  Pearl and countless others. What a beauitfully woven story that's sure to  keep your attention and leave you questioning what's more important to you  and your family.<br />I thank Dr.Taylor-Thompson for assigning me this book,  as well as Gloria Naylor's other novels to read and present to the class. I  truly feel blessed to have been in her class both of my first semesters at  Texas Southern University. She's a beauitful and wonderful mentor, who's  inspired me in so many ways.	2000-07-20

I read this book in a day! I just couldn't put it down! From page one I was pulled in and left wanting more. This story introduced us to characters such as Raymond,  Sela, Basil, Kelvin, Kyle, Nicole and Candance to name a few. The choices  and paths they choose to take and how they affect the ones they love. The  story also shows how secrets infest and destroy relationships. It's a story  that sheds light on gay men and the lifestyle they lead. You're able to get  a better understanding of these men and their world. This book showed me  that regardless of our sexual desires, we're all human with needs, fears  and desires. I know men who've struggled with their sexuality and what's  &quot;politically correct&quot;, according to society. I'm glad E.Lynn  Harris gave a voice to this world and showed us the good, the bad and ugly.  This is thought provoking novel your's sure to enjoy. Thanks E.Lynn for a  wonderful book on a beauitful morning.	2000-07-20

This novel is part-two to E.Lynn Harris' first novel Invisible Life. Once again we're engrossed in the lives of Raymond, Basil, Nicole and Kyle. We're introduced to newcomers like, Jared, Delaney, Gilliam, Pierce and  Janelle. E.Lynn has chosen new locations such as Atlanta and trips back  home to bring us into the pages of this wonderful story. Plus he still has  things going on in his old stumping ground of New York. This was another  book I can't put down.(May 1999) I picked this one up as soon as I  completed Invisible Life and when I looked at the clock I realized I'd been  reading and sitting in the same spot on my porch since the morning sunrise.  This book is compelling, powerful and yes BOLD. It's laced with rich and  beauitful language and continues to broaden your understanding of gay men  and the choices they make. AWESOME!  AWESOME!  That's what comes to mind  when I think of E.Lynn Harris and his writing style. Now it's on to Abide  With Me, which is part three of this &quot;AWESOME&quot; trilogy.

Gritty and Compelling	This was the second novel of Gloria Naylor's that was assigned to me by Dr.Taylor-Thompson(Texas Southern U.) and at first I found it to be a strange and complex book. I often talked with Dr.Thompson to make sure I  was getting the point. To my surprise I was and started to enjoy the book  once I realized what was going on. The story I've been told mirrors that of  Amiri Baraka's(LeRoi Jones)Dante's Inferno, which I also plan to  read.<br />What I found so compelling about this story was how the residence  seem to believe they were nothing if they didn't live on certain streets  within Linden Hills, an affluent African American suburb. They were  educated, money hunger and strange all in one. Willie the main character  and narrator, along with his bestfriend Lester take us on a journey beyond  the walls of these strange peoples homes and into their lives for an  unforgettable experience. They introduce us to people like Luther Nedeed,  Willa Prescott-Nedeed, Xavier Donnell, Rev.Michael T.Hollis and Laurel  Dumont to name a few. What the story reveals is greed, the need for power  and more power and the hierachy of what they believed life to truly be. I'm  planning and looking forward to reading this book again. Naylor's style of  writing maybe complex at first but, you'll soon get over that and find the  book very thought-provoking. You'll then be hooked ready to read her other  wondeful novels. I recommend this book to all, especially english teachers  in middle school and beyond for their students	2000-07-20

My first but NOT my last	This was the first novel of Gloria Naylor's that I read and it was truly awesome. As my assignment this past semester(Jan-May 2000)my professor wanted me to read every novel by Naylor in the order they were written and  published. Since I &quot;LOVE&quot; to read and am coordinator of my own  book club, this was simple for me. I'd seen the movie, The Women of  Brewester Place countless times and loved it.<br />The Women of Brewester  Place is beauitfully written and is a touching story about seven Black  women, with only one thing in common. They all reside in Brewester Place, a  dead end street with a brick wall to keep them from the other side. These  ladies give us a inside view into their lives. We see the trials and  tribulations each of them has or come to endure. We see why they live as  they do and come to love the strength and courage they come to possess  before it's too late for them all. The most compelling part of the book to  me was the part entitled, &quot;The Two.&quot; This part of the book is  heartwarming, gripping and surreal and it truly leaves an impression on  you. I cheered for these women as they came into their own and was ready to  cuss them for being so naive and passive at times. However, this book was  just entertaining as the movie and gives a more indepth look at each of  them. One thing I can say , this was a book who's story seemed to have gone  straight from the pages to the screen. We rarely see that where books are  concern these days. I recommend this heartwarming novel.	2000-07-20

I never excepted anything less. This book was well worth the money. I was pulled into the drama that surrounded Naomi and Juanita and wondered when enough would be enough. The  painful past that was cripling and haunting both Dana and Vince was enough  to break anyones heart. I felt a sense of hope, renewal and compassion for  Womack and Rosa Lee and their lives together. However, when it came to the  whole Malaika, Kwanzaa and Vince situation my heartached and left me with a  bitter taste in my mouth. I envied, applauded and praised Gerri for her  sheer guts and determination. All and all the book pulled me in from  beginning to end. It explores and shows you the the good, the bad and the  ugly of what lies and being a liar will get you. I'm glad we chose this as  our book club selection of the month and I truly look forward to our  discussion of yet another Eric Jerome Dickey bestseller. This one being a  Liar's Game.	2000-07-15

What a wonderful book full of surprises and some seriously unexpected turns. This book is an awakening, a serious wake-up call for people and the way they choose to live their lives. The past you carry around with you  like baggage or the shame you bare (as DeeDee does)when you have no  closure. Page after page I could see, feel and taste the hope, strength,  sprirt and faith that was revealing itself to characters like DeeDee,  Sarita, Freddy, Tyeesha, Skylar and Jade. This book tells the story of a  woman(DeeDee) who discounts herself because she believes she isn't  beauitful, she's aging, she's not the right color and her weight. She's  hauling some serious baggage and doesn't seem to have room for anything or  anybody other than her cat Langston. That is until Skylar and Brianna come  into her life. This book had me missing my friends and looking for the  nearest Belly Dance Classes. Thanks for the wonderful and inspiring read  Ms. Sinclair. Our book club truly enjoyed it.	2000-07-15

This book seemed to be so real, it was as though I knew  these people. I felt like I was part of the story. This book will restore  your faith in love and show you the true meaning of it. This would be an  EXCELLENT movie and I hope to see it on the screen one day. I always look  forward to reading Eric's books.<br />  My biggest kick came when Cheaters was  release and as I was reading it, there was my nickname &quot;Toy&quot;....I  couldn't wait to meet Eric, when he came to Houston and I look forward to  seeing him again when he does his tour for Liar's Game.

I had a trip back down memory lane with this one for  sure...It was definately ONE BETTER. I ached for the painful struggles  Spice, Mink, Sterling and Carmen endured while struggling to save their  families. Each seeking peace in a world of confusion and chaos.

Jeremy &quot;J&quot; has lived his life with blinders on that is  until the death of his father, a man he never really knew. His journey back  home, enables him to free himself of his pain and truly see that he isn't  the only one that's suffered heartache and pain along the way.

This story pulls at your heart strings and shows you how important  a father's love and acceptance are to his son. It tells the story of how  secrets, lies and the past will catch up with you sooner or later and shows  the lengths that a family will sometimes go to. Walking Through Mirrors is  a story of bonding and healing and how important it is to love and cherish  one another before it's too late.	2000-06-17

I felt like I was a part of the story. It's always great to read  a book you can lose yourself in and this was one for me. I just couldn't  put it down and had to read parts to anyone willing to listen. I plan to  buy copies for friends and family members. Victor is giving a new voice and  face to the literary word and it's truly a welcoming addition. Be on the  lookout for more great novels from Victor.

I read everyone of his books in 3-4 days. Abide With Me was supreme...I couldn't put it down most of the time. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a serious DRAMA!  That Yancey was too much and got exactly what she deserved...NOTHING. How  could she and Ava be so coldhearted toward Nicole. That Basil Henderson is  a true piece of work full of himself and BULL too.I look forward to reading  about him constantly, and think he needs a book dedicated totally to him.  Seeing Raymond struggle with issues of commitment, love, and truth was  heartwarming. I found myself being his and Nicole's personal cheerleader.  I'm glad they became friends again and that both are happy. Ava's hatred  toward Nicole was so real and typical in showbiz. Blaming everyone and  everything for her non-success.I feel like I'm in the story at times.  E.Lynn knows how to capture his audience and keep us........It's soooo  abiding..	1999-06-15
