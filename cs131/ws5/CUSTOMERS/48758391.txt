Sure he was good in Neverwhere, he entertained us in Stardust, set the comic book world on it's ear in The Sandman but he has never been this good. American Gods is epic - it spans miles and time and depth. It is a story of massive proportions that gets to the basics of what we believe in and why. It is about faith and love and fighting for existence. It is also a discourse on America. Here is this Brit making his observations about America. And he's right on people.<br /><br />I won't get into the plot because I hate to give away too much of books but when you read it, pay attention to the parts where Shadow stays with the two men who run the funeral home. This is probably one of my favorite parts of the book. Ibis and Jacquel are two great characters and Shadow's time at the funeral home is just fantastic. Gaiman is a master character creator. Even when his characters are gods, they are still human enough.<br /><br />American Gods is literature at it's best. Not fantasy but great literature.	2005-10-05

Two friends of mine kept bugging me, \\"Read Martin!\\" but I was skeptical. I'm not a typical fantasy reader. All the swords and sorcery stuff usually bores me. I've tried on numerous occasions to put a dent in Jordan's first book but usually I fall asleep or my mind wanders. Give me King, Gaiman, De Lint, Tolkien, Keyes, Fforde, and Salvatore... any of these guys and I'm a happy man. But I try to stay away from straight D&D fantasy. \\"He's not like that,\\" they told me.<br /><br />Then, A Game of Thrones came in to our bookstore with a special price of $3.99. So I bought it. I'm a sucker for a good deal!<br /><br />Now, a few weeks later, I've finished it. And HOLY CRAP! That was GOOD! It was better than good it was GREAT! The characters are rich and fantastic and devious and wonderful and heart-breaking and maddening. This is character-driven fantasy. There are no huge plot points that are not created by the characters' interaction. Whether they are warring, backstabbing, screwing, avenging... everything in this book is driven by an amazing cast of characters. I found myself taking my time but wanting to know what happened next so damn bad my slow reading pace was killing me. Also, there are hints at things in side stories and small glimpses of what to come. And I can't wait! I'm going to take a small break from Martin but I've already bought Clash of Kings and can't wait to leap back in.<br /><br />If you've been hemming and hawing about reading his books, stop, and read them. You will not be let down.	2005-09-23

Usually, I hate these things but having read the excerpts and having seen an advance cut of the movie, I figured I'd give it a go. And I was not let down. Two things:<br /><br />DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE! It will ruin the surprise and pace of the movie and take away from your viewing pleasure. I mean this as no disrespect to Keith but rather as complement in that he has done his job in spades!<br /><br />After seeing the movie (and the series), READ THIS BOOK! It gives back story and insights into the movie that you might not have thought of. It gets into each character's head and you can't but help but love his time in Jayne's cranium. It's a riot! River's stuff is really good also. Fantastic is the way he touches on almost every episode of Firefly in the book too. This book is a Browncoat's dream.<br /><br />That said, enjoy this book. Keith has done a great job and deserves a hearty handshake. Hell he enjoys a kiss from Kaylee... but that makes me a might jealous thinking about it so I'm not going to...<br /><br />Keep flying!	2005-09-13

He's a god among men. Powers, Jinx, Daredevil, Alias, Goldfish... these are some of the best comic books that money can buy. He writes great noir and fantastic dark stories.<br /><br />But the New Avengers, having risen from the ashes of Avengers Disassembled, has left me with a few issues that could be problems later on:<br /><br />Lineup. This team is a little too much contrived for my own tastes.<br />1. Luke Cage, having a big resurgence in recent years (thanks to Bendis and the Maxx comics) as a bad-a$$ African-American superhero. I like Luke Cage. He's cool to the core. He's the Samuel L. Jackson of the Original Marvel Universe. Yet, what are his powers? His skin's unbreakable and he can punch. He's the strong-arm.<br />2. Spider-Man. Another power-house. Sure he can swing around on his webs too but only if he has something to adhere them to. Take the boy out of the city and he's in trouble. Also, Bendis under uses Web-head. He's a comic relief for the team. Spider-Man is better than that and Bendis knows that.<br />3. Captain America. I have no problems with Captain. He's a born leader, strategist, moral compass, and all-around great superhero. Only problem is that he's a strong-arm too. Sure he can throw his shield but only so far. Captain America is all about fisticuffs and throwing the shield around.<br />4. Iron-Man. Now we get into some power. The suit can do amazing things (but can it toast a piece of bread just right?) and having Iron-Man on the team adds mobility and power to the team. Also, Tony Stark has developed from his tortured, recovering alcoholic into this playboy, all-around fun guy in recent years.<br />5. Spider-Woman. I always have a problem with the female knock-offs of male characters (Batgirl, Spider-Woman, Supergirl, She-hulk, etc). I'm not being sexist here at all. I love female superheroes. Give me Rouge, Storm, Sue Storm, and the Wasp (especially The Ultimate's Wasp). Spider-Woman has most of Spider-Man's powers but can shoot \\"venom blasts\\" from her wrists. So mostly she's a strong arm with limited-range artillery.<br />6. Wolverine. Same as Luke Cage in that Logan's a rough-neck who will get the job done at any costs. A strong-arm with a killer set of claws and even deadlier instincts. On top of that, he works with the X-Men, but as an Avenger, I don't get it.<br /><br />So my problem is that this team was put together by the marketing guys instead of the writers. Luke Cage, black. Spider-Man, popular, Captain America and Iron Man, staples, Spider-Woman, chick, and Wolverine, popular. This is not a team put together to be Marvel's Authority or JLA. 5 out 6 members are earthbound. This is not a good all-around team.<br /><br />Story: the story is for the most part weak. The whole escape of the bad guys and the subsequent hunt for them would be a great premise. To have S.H.E.I.L.D. be the bad guys is interesting but I think could be limiting. To have the guys go after the escapees every week would be great.<br /><br />Artwork: I love Finch's artwork but sometimes it's not the right type of work for the book that Bendis is writing. Finch doesn't do repeating panels very well. Nor does he handle panels when it's just someone's face. He tends to put too much detail into it. Oeming does Bendis' writing style justice. Finch doesn't. But then give him an action sequence and the boy shines like a beacon. If Finch is going to be a regular, than Bendis needs to write to Finch's strengths. That's the only way this book can flourish.<br /><br />Overall: If this book is going to be a \\"Dark\\" Avengers, then go that route. The whole going to Savage Land made no sense. Luke Cage and Spider-Man are city superheroes. Wolverine can work just as well crouching in the back alleys, chasing down one of the escaped convicts. Make it dark, keep them in cities, and have them chase down the remaining victims. It will give the series structure and will allow you to take a superhero group in a whole new direction: hunting down criminals. It could be very interesting.<br /><br />Sorry for the novel. I just wanted to put my three cents in. This comic has serious potential. It just doesn't know what it wants to be.g down criminals. It could be very interesting.    Sorry for the novel. I just wanted to put my three cents in. This comic has serious potential. It just doesn't know what it wants to be.	2005-08-30

I read it 8 years ago when I was just starting as a mystery reader. And God, was I blown away yet again! Even more so this time because having read a lot of mysteries since then, I'm able to see how much a gem this book is and how fantastic Laurie is as a writer!<br /><br />The delving into the psychology of paintings, the subtle language of the narrative, the plotting, the characters, the settings, and just about everything else makes this book such an amazing book. I've been a fan of Laurie's for a while now and it's good to go back and see why you first fell in love with this author in the first place. I love her Mary Russell series very much but her Kate Martinelli books are so first class that it hurts me to read her. She pulls off a complex story with such ease that you can't help but be left in awe.<br /><br />Pick this up and I promise you will not be let down. Enjoy San Francisco with one of it's finest detectives.	2005-08-19

It was when the Great Cow Race was just coming out in single issues. I took one look at it and was like, \\"They look like Smurfs!\\" I passed on the comic and didn't read them until I picked up the first collection, Out from Boneville, on a whim. And man, was I wrong.<br /><br />This ain't no Smurfs!<br /><br />This is high fantasy at it's best. This is a novel, plain and simple. It's on par with Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia. This is as good as it gets, hands down.<br /><br />I remember the first thing I noticed was its great humor. You can't help but be charmed by its characters, from Fone Bone all the way to Ted the Bug. Even the two Stupid, Stupid Rat Creatures. Then comes the subtle artwork. Sure, it looks cartoony but God it's beautiful. The way the panels move and flow between each other. His story telling pacing is amazing! Jeff Smith is a master storyteller.<br /><br />Ever since I picked up that first collection, I have been suggesting Bone to anyone who is a fantasy fan!<br /><br />I was rereading this over the weekend and my girlfriend, who is not a big comic book fan, looked over my shoulder and was like \\"Wow!

Akira, hands down, is probably one of the greatest, if the greatest, graphic novels ever. It is an amazing, unbelievably-detailed, engrossing, visually stunning, and fantastically written book. One that will stay with you like a great novel does. You can't help but be drawn into the plot, the characters, the artwork and not be profoundly changed by it. I remember being introduced to it as a teenager and feeling that my life had changed somehow because I'd read Akira.<br /><br />In the first volume, we get a taste of the genius to come.

I just finished HP6 and I was a little burned-out (something about reading 651 pages in two days that burns a person out). I needed something to just enjoy and not have to be reading every single word and analyzing what was going to happen next. Laura was just what I needed. Tess was just what I needed.<br /><br />As 2nd books go, this one was very good. It was a little uneven in that it gets really heavy and intense later but is in odd contrast to the beginning, which isn't so intense. The addition of Esskay and Tess' emerging feelings for the dog are great. More of Crow, which is something that is also great. These are fantastic characters that one can't help but wanting to fall back in with them and enjoy your time among them.<br /><br />I'm going to read the third book. I feel like I'm on a Laura Lippman kick. Not a bad to place to be, let me tell you.	2005-07-27

It's rare that you find a sequel that succeeds where the first book succeeded and is actually better than the first. Sure, there are mystery series where the books get better because the characters are better defined, the plots more intense and intricate, and the pacing faster. Usually, this happens because the writer is just getting better. Jasper Fforde is good. He was really good in Eyre Affair. I mean really, really good.<br /><br />And yet, he's gotten better.<br /><br />How about that? Lost in a Good Book is great! A bit confusing at times but then that seems to be part of his charm. Fforde likes to get you lost on purpose. He explains himself in the end but his books are definitely for those who trust an author enough to lead you by the hand through some confusing stuff but have a good time all the while. Thursday Next is taken to a whole new level of a character and the introduction of new characters (especially Ms. Havisham) makes this series seem all the more better. I can't wait for the next book...<br /><br />...but Potter comes out tonight and I must read the new book.

There are few books that when I'm reading them for the first time, I stop and say, \\"WOW!\\" Sorcerer's Stone was one of them. So was Neverwhere. About the time when the bad guys were chasing Door in the beginning of Neverwhere, I had to just close the book for a second, and just say, \\"Man, this is amazing.\\"<br /><br />About 10 pages into The Eyre Affair, I was feeling that way again. Man, what a world Fforde has created! Sure, it's a world that we know kind of - but still it's an amazing place. Airships, time abnormalities, reversed-extinct animals, Rocky Horror Picture Show-like productions of Richard III, and - so much more! I don't want to take away any of the joy of this book from you so my suggestions to you are this:<br /><br />1) Buy it!<br /><br />2) Don't read the back cover!<br /><br />3) And jump in! I mean head first right into the pages and just enjoy yourself because it's impossible not too!<br /><br />This book is fun, fast paced, adventuresome, and with a character who is just amazing. I have to admit that I got me a big crush on Thursday Next. She's pretty great in my book!<br /><br />I've passed this book over so many times because I thought it would be ridiculous but now I'm kicking myself for all the lost time that I could have been enjoying it.<br /><br />Good work, Mr. Fforde.

Half a Life is the second story arc of a continuing comic called Gotham Central. And Gotham has never looked this gritty since Miller left for warmer climates. Michael Lark, who deserves immense amounts of money for the unbelievable work that he does, provides artwork that is to die for. It's dark and taut and each panel is perfection. Greg Rucka provides us with a very, very excellent character in Renee Montoya. She is tough as balls, intense, and very human. This is powerful storytelling.<br /><br />Gotham Central has turned out to be one of the best comics in the past couple of years. Pushing Batman and his cast of crazy villains to the side as cameos and giving us the meat of the cops lives and cases provides hours of riveting reading. And rereading. Because these stories have depths and nuances that you didn't pick up the first time, trust me.<br /><br />BTW, highly suggest Bruebaker and Lark's Scene of the Crime GN. Good stuff there too! Really good!	2005-06-30

Perhaps one of the funniest authors on the planet, this new book isn't all about laughs. It's about people trying to figure it all out. It's answering the big questions: why are we here? Why do bad things happen? Should we just do ourselves in when it's all turned to crap? Not that there aren't funny parts. Because there are. He has a gift for creating funny scenes. For giving us real, fantastically detailed characters. Characters are what move Hornby's books, not plot devices.<br /><br />A Long Way Down rambles sometimes. It meanders along and you wonder how it will resolve itself and then it just does. But I was happy when I put it down. Not happy that it was over but happy that I had taken a walk with these four characters. His narration of each of them is spot on to their personalities. Each one of them, in many ways, tries to explain to you why they have got it figured out but in the end it's whatever you yourself have taken from the book that is the point.<br /><br />I won't say that because it's about four people thinking about committing suicide that it should be required reading for anyone who has thought about suicide. I'm sure there are more thought provoking, life saving books. I will say that it should be required reading for people who are Nick Hornby fans and for anyone who has ever thought, \\"What's the point of this s#$t!\\" And who hasn't thought that, huh?	2005-06-24

Not just good stories but great characters (wait `till you meet the profiler) and interesting details and a plot that just flies along at top speed. This book begins and doesn't stop throttling along until the end. And what an end it is!<br /><br />This is what we've been waiting for, folks! The juice about Pendergast is between these pages. You get to meet Diogenes and man, is he evil! Diogenes renders Pendergast a more mortal character. He's not his usual five-steps-ahead of everyone else but a man who is being hunted and knows it! D'Agosta is back and in great form. Along with a whole cast of characters from other Preston/Child books. It's like a family reunion!<br /><br />Now, a small complaint: I didn't like this book as much as Brimstone. I don't know if that I had it really built up in my head or that it just wasn't as good as it could be. There were some story lines that seemed placed for no particular reason other than to keep us guessing or to fill pages. Don't get me wrong, these story lines are great but the seem to take a way from the meat of the story. Also, I had this strange idea in my head that I would have liked to see D'Agosta take on Diogenes on his own. I think D'Agosta is more than just Pendergast's Watson.<br /><br />Supposedly, this is book two of a Pendergast trilogy. As a middle book, it's really good. Now, I can't wait for the next book!	2005-06-23

All the reviews and such I've read about this book state that it's a great book for video gamers, however, I feel that's too small of an audience. This is a very good book that should appeal to anyone in their 20's-early 30's who is just lost. There's a reason why the book is called Lucky WANDER Boy. The book is about working a pointless job, being involved in confusing relationships, looking back on our childhood to find deeper meaning, and figuring out what the hell we are going to do with the rest of our life.<br /><br />I liked this book a lot. There are a few things that bring it down and might loose readers, however, I don't want to dwell on them because they are stylistic and plot choices of the writer. There are a lot of funny moments and his essays on the different video games are great. The characters are well formed and quite interesting. The Portal Plant and it's inhabitants are a strange and dysfunctional family.<br /><br />One of the things that truly interested me about this book was that Adam's narrative seemed not always to be trusted. There's only one other book (and one that I absolutely loved) whose narrator made me start to doubt his observations and that was Debt To Pleasure by John Lanchester. If you haven't read that book, I highly suggest it. Often, it felt in Lucky Wander Boy that Adam told us what he wanted to see and not what was really happening. He seemed like a man who could lie to himself quite easily - and convince himself even easier. Still, he has an interesting story to be told...<br /><br />Don't read Lucky Wander Boy if you are a video game fan but read Lucky Wander Boy if you are alive. And lost.	2005-06-06

He always gives me a great story, fantastic dialogue, intense action, poignant moments, honest emotion, and tension that crackles like the pages of the book. He also leaves me feeling that the world would be better if Pike and Elvis were out there doing their thing.<br /><br />I'm always a little worried to go back to an author's first book. When you've read books later in the series, like I have done with Crais' Cole series, I'm always afraid that the first book is going to be weak or a letdown. Not the case here. Except for the sort-of lame cover, this book is as good as any of his later novels. Crais left me breathless as he usually does. And for that, I salute him as the Detective-Novel god that he is.<br /><br />Some criticism: there seemed to be a few inconsistencies between backstory that we would get later on with Cole and Pike. I think at one time Cole mentioned something about his dad. Also, Cole seemed to be about sex a lot more than other books. I thought in most cases it was put in to make the story more noir. You know, tough guy with a gun who lays the pretty ladies. But then, I remembered that the book was written in '87 - a different time. So maybe I'm pushing my '05 sensibilities on an '87 book. These are small criticisms, though. This is a strong beginning to an awesome series. Rock on Elvis Cole!<br /><br />BTW, who wanted Joe Pike to end up with Ellen Lang as much as I did?	2005-04-20

Each time I find something new, something that foretells what is to come, something funny that I never noticed before. Each time I enjoy this book as much as I did the first time I read it. There is such joy in Rowling's writing. Such fun and danger and such wonder. My only complaint is that it should have been longer. There is so much to cover in Harry's first year at Hogwarts that it could have been a few hundred more pages easily. The Sorcerer's Stone sets the stage for the brilliance to follow and one can't help but get caught up in the fun.<br /><br />Thanks Mrs. Rowling, you are the true magician.	2005-04-12

And when I was done, when I had closed the last page, I could only take a deep breath and think, \\"Damn this is going to be awesome on the screen!\\"<br /><br />Now as for the book, it's great. Matthew Stover is an amazing author. Shatterpoint was a little better at showing Stover's gifts because of the fact he created and wrote the whole thing - not adapted it from a screenplay. But still Revenge is very, very good. It's tight, cold when it needs to be, fanciful when that's caused for. There's a lot of what's going on in the minds of the characters compared to what we are going to see on the screen. You can tell also that Stover has a love for Mace Windu. Mace has got it going on in this book. And it plays really nicely into Luceno's Labyrinth of Evil. The two fit together really well. If you were thinking of skipping Labyrinth, I would suggest rethinking that notion. Because to really enjoy the novelization and get it's references, you should read Labyrinth. And Shatterpoint. He makes a few references of Mace's time on his home planet.<br /><br />A few bones of contention: the last 100 pages are really sparse. The stuff that Lucas really wants you to love and drop your jaw at on the screen, Stover goes over really quickly. The fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan is two pages, at best. I think it supposedly gets ten minutes of screen time. Also, the battle between Yoda and the Emperor is glossed over. And there are no real time spent or even glimpses of Chewie's home world. I know that Lucas is saving that for the film but still I think Stover is getting cheated as a writer because he could have done better things with it. Anakin's fight with Doku is tops, though! So is Obi-Wan's battle with Grevious!<br /><br />To sum it up, I really loved this book. I couldn't put it down and now that it's done, I miss it. I've read all the Prequel novels and I feel like I can close the book on Star Wars until Episode III hits the theaters. I'm glad that it ended with this book. Actually, if anyone were to read them in order, they'd get three really great books in a row with Dark Rendezvous, Labyrinth of Evil, and Revenge of the Sith.<br /><br />May the Force be with us all.hits the theaters.

Audrey Niffenegger is a fantastic writer who tapped into something powerful when she wrote the story of Claire and Henry! Never before have I ever fallen in love with characters so fast nor longed to return to them time and time again. I've read this book four times, people! And every time I love it more and more. It's so wonderful and moving and funny and exciting and... it's everything a great novel should be!<br /><br />A few things:<br /><br />Some of you might be put off by the Time Travel thing. Get over it! This is not a Sci-Fi book although she postulates a few interesting theories about why Henry time travels. It's more about family, love, friendship, self-abuse, rock and roll, love of books, fears, childhood, family tragedies, Chicago, fear of the future, and so many more subjects that I'm totally blanking on. That's what this book is about: life! It's not about how cool it would be to time travel! Actually, Henry really doesn't like it that much. It's about how much we are often NOT in control of our destines! Sometimes that's good. Sometimes it isn't. But it's life.<br /><br />Some of you might be put off by the back-and-forth in narration. This is one of the book's great strengths! To write in two character's voices and do them so convincing, is an amazing feat! Claire's voice is great and spot-on, as you'd expect having been written by a woman. But it's Henry's voice that, I feel, is the more unbelievable of the two! Henry is a real male character. He's not some stupid invention of the perfect guy nor is he some macho stereotype. He is a complex, articulate, humorous, heartbreaking character that blows me away. Never before have I read a book by a woman who nails a male character so perfect! Hell, even some male writers can't write a guy this well! And this book has such a variety of such side characters that you can't wait for them to walk back into the book. Gomez, Mrs Kim, Henry's dad, Claire's sisters, and so many others. This book is so full of fully-realized characters that you will wish that they were your own family or friends or lovers.<br /><br />Those two things seem to be the hardest things for general readers to get past. They hear about how it's about time travel or that it jumps back and forth in character's heads. I say, \\"People were reading a book told by a girl who was dead (Lonely Bones), so what's the big problem?\\"<br /><br />I love diving back into this book time and time again! I see it on the shelf and I can't help myself from just opening it up and diving right in, wherever I might be. Trust me on this one: pick this book up! Be sucked in! I promise, a promise in my hearts of hearts, you will not be let down!others.

No two ways to look at it. He knows his stuff. This book didn't have to be a Star Wars book. It could stand on it's own as a discourse on war. It could be seen as a social commentary on certain countries. It could easily just be a great Sci/Fi novel.<br /><br />This is Mace Windu. More than just Samuel L. Jackson sitting Indian-style, fingers together, talking in that cool voice of his. This is more than just Mace slicing through the neck of Jenga Fett. This is Mace Windu, warts and all. You get to know a character so well you can almost imagine him sitting across from you not having a conversation. If only all Star Wars books could deliver such characterization. Could deliver such story. Could deliver...<br /><br />I thought Dark Rendezvous was the best Clone Wars book out there. Shatterpoint rivals it. I don't want to say which one is better because they are vastly different yet both excel in battle scenes, characterization, plot, and summing up what the Clone Wars are: the beginning of the end of the Jedi.<br /><br />May the Force be with you.	2005-03-22

He's been doing this novelist thing for awhile now and knows how to write a story. So when he takes Lucas' script and balances and adds to it, you'd think Lucas would have looked at what he had done and maybe said to himself, \\"that's not a bad idea. I'll just do some of what Terry has done.\\" But he didn't and, alas, we were left with Phantom Menace - a disjointed film at best.<br /><br />The novel is very good in that it gives us the story in a brisk pace and it's characters in interesting ways. It also gives it in a balanced manner - starting with Anakin in the beginning and not just introducing him halfway through the story. We get some back-story of characters and scenes of interest like Anakin's care of a hurt Tusken Raider and the previous podrace against Sebulba when he \\"flashed his vents.\\" There are parts where we can see Brooks trying to do what he can with Lucas' script when the writing is just plain bad. Not Brook's fault - it's the source material.<br /><br />On the overall, this is a good book that gives you plenty of Star Wars action and tries to make up for what eventually ended up on the screen. Brook's portrayal of Anakin and Qui Gonn are very good. They have a better dynamic than in the movie and I found myself very moved (much like I was when I first read this book - a little bit on that: I'm reading the books over again in preparation of Episode III. I read this book the day it came out and loved it. I was very disappointed when I saw the movie and saw that much of what Brooks had accomplished was lost on the screen or wasn't attempted at all) when Qui Gonn was cut down. I would still like a little more on Obi-Wann's drawing on the force to leap out of the pit, over Darth Maul, and then killing him. I would have liked to get in his head a little more and find out what was going on. It doesn't seem like that monumental a thing in the book or on the screen however it's enough to get him made a Jedi Master. Also, I want to know why the hell Maul didn't react but stood there like he was glued to the frigging floor! But I digress...<br /><br />Brooks is a great writer and this is a good book. The best complement I can give is this: it's better than the movie.ant to know why the hell Maul didn't react but stood there like he was glued to the frigging floor!

I've read it about three or four times since I first bought it back in '95 and read it on my way home from a vacation in Florida. I love the story, the Natural History Museum as a setting, and the characters (especially Pendergast and Margo Green - D'Agosta also). I have since then read most of Mr. Preston and Mr. Child's novels, relishing in the sequel Reliquary (\\"okay\\" but I like Haywood a lot), the excitement of Cabinet of Curiosities (which I liked a lot), and the suspense of Still Life with Crows (also good, but for me, not as good as Curiosities) and a few others. I took my time with their books, saving them as treats for when I needed a good book that would definitely not let me down.<br /><br />Then came Brimstone. It feels, in many ways, that they were building up to this one. As if some of the events in the other books were being piled on and piled on until we got to Brimstone. Of course, having read the book, I see that it's more so for the next novel, Dance of Death. But I'm getting too far ahead...<br /><br />Brimstone is great! Taut, suspenseful, humorous in places, almost always interesting in it's subject matter of the arcane occult, arms dealing, and violins. Their characterization, as always, was spot on. However, I felt we got even more from these characters this time. D'Agosta really came into his own in this book. Pendergast was awesome as always yet he seemed a little more human with his revelations of his brother and the addition of Constance Green, a character that I expect more story about in the future. I couldn't put Brimstone down and was sad when it was over. I think I was starting to piss my girlfriend off because all I wanted to do was read the book any free second I got.<br /><br />And now it's over... and I have to wait for 3 months until the new book. Sadness, unfortunately, sets in. Thank you Messrs. Preston and Child, you have entertained me so but have left me sad because you are just too damn good.because you are just too damn good.	2005-03-14

It moves at a break-neck pace, has a fine collection of characters, and takes no prisoners from the first page to the last. That said, it isn't one of Robert Crais' best novels. If this was a James Patterson novel or even a Michael Crichton where cardboard characters, over-plotting, and emotional blackmail are the name of the game, then Hostage would be one of their better novels. But having read most of Robert Crais' other books, I know this to be one of his weaker books. He is capable of better characterization, better writing. Sometimes I felt like he was forcing me to react in a certain way instead of just letting me react. This was a great exercise in plotting and how to make a worse situation worse and then make it even worse. Talley was a worthy hero yet I wish we could have had more about his past beyond the \\"bad situation\\" and what happened after that. I will say that Mars was a really nasty character and I liked him a lot.<br /><br />Hostage is a good book. It's a good read. It's just not a showcase of what Crais is capable of doing. I hope it's a good movie. I hope Crais gets more press from the movie and everyone can see what a great novelist he is. Good luck Robert!	2005-03-07

That she is an impressive author who keeps getting better with each new book? That she has created a wonderful and believable character in Tess Monaghan? That her books are expertly paced and full of humor and heart? That if I were to meet Tess in real life, I would fall slavishly in love with her? Well, perhaps no one has said the last thing. I admit I've always had a thing for tall women.<br /><br />By a Spider's Thread is everything we hope to expect from Ms. Lippman and much more. That's what happens every time I read one of her books: she exceeds my expectations. And let me tell you, my expectations for her work are pretty high and with each subsequent book, keep getting higher. Spider's Thread gives us her usual cast of characters (I could have used more of Crow) and excellent new characters, a steady-moving plot, suspense, Tess's oftern humorous narrative, and the introduction of the SnoopSisters: a group I found to be rather interesting. Ms. Lippman is inventive, humorous, and entertaining. Who could ask for anything more? All right, a date with Ms. Monaghan -- but I know that's just a pipe dream!	2005-03-02

I saw an interview with her on CBS' Sunday Morning a couple of years ago and bought her most recent book for my dad. He's a mystery fan who likes his crime novels on the lighter side than me. I like Lehane, Connelly, Rankin - the noir stuff. How could this woman from Baltimore be writing stuff as good as the guys above? Not being sexist, here - I just couldn't see it. I should have thought of Laurie R. King who's Kate Martinelli series is as dark and good as the guys above. But, I didn't. I'm a moron! I just plowed through a litany of other books to read until I came upon this book. I asked my dad if he liked her and he replied, \\"Yes. A lot!\\" It dealt with Edgar Allen Poe and the Poe Visitor. Seemed interesting. So I gave it a try.<br /><br />Man, was I wrong! Laura is great! Strange City is witty and dark and quick-paced and has characters that are real and fantastic. Tess is one hell of a woman and I'm okay to admit that I'm a little in love with her. She's smart and sexy and tough but still vulnerable. I totally underestimated Laura and I promise that I will never to do that again.<br /><br />Keep at it Laura - Spenser ain't got nothing on you!	2005-02-23

I'm not talking about reporting or the ins and outs of a being a working PI but writing novels. Not just novels but damn good novels. Here, Laura knows her stuff. Very, very well.<br /><br />The Last Place is excellent. If you've never read her before, you are going to be surprised. Actually, if you've never read her before I would say go back to the beginning with Baltimore Blues because you need to read the progression of her character. Tess doesn't start off this tough as nails, sharp as a tack PI but as a reporter looking for work. Not only will you see the progression of the character but also the writer. Laura keeps getting better. With every book she takes what she learned from the last one and builds upon it. Her narration gets stronger, her descriptions more detailed, her plot tighter, and her books keep getting better. Laura knocks me side the head with each new novel and The Last Place is no exception.<br /><br />Actually, it's better than that. I put this book down with a sense that I had just read something amazing and strong and the tip of an iceberg. I put this book down very pleased and for that I quite indebted to her. Thank you Ms. Lipman.	2005-02-23

I walk into a B&N or a Border's and I see John Grisham or James Patterson on their front displays. Big signs trying to sell the latest lark from these guys and I think to myself, Robert deserves better. He deserves to be up there on the front display. He deserves a sign that says, \\"The Best Damn Thriller You Are Going To Read This Year.\\" Hell, that's not even good enough! He deserves: \\"Robert Crais = Thriller.\\"<br /><br />The Forgotten Man is, hands down, his best work. I thought LA Requiem was great. It was sad and harsh and vivid and gritty but Forgotten Man goes beyond that. Elvis Cole may be one of the best detectives in all of mystery. He is unbelievably defined, attainable, funny, surprising, and, sometimes, heartbreaking. Cole is as real as Rankin's Rebus, Lehane's Kenzie, and Lippman's Monaghan. They are so detailed you can see them clearly in your mind's eye. See them sitting at a table at your favorite restaurant (or if we're talking about Rebus and Kenzie, your favorite bar.)<br /><br />Joe Pike is back too - not as much as I would have liked him to. If I had one complaint on this book it would have been not enough Joe Pike. Starkey is also back for more. And WOW! That character is going places. Crais has such a gift at creating unforgettable, fantastic characters. Characters that live with you even after the book is done. And, let me tell you, it's done too quick!<br /><br />I have been following Crais' career for a while now and all I can say is that he deserves better. Not because he can sell lots of books but because he delivers what others fail too. Why read the newest book from some author who jumped the shark five books ago when you can read a book from someone who delivers what the other guy should time after time after time? If you are a lover of hard-boiled fiction, do yourself a favor and buy Forgotten Man. You won't regret it and you will be giving Robert Crais deserves: your attention.	2005-02-23

He gives us descriptions and reasons and explanations about things we saw in Phantom and things we only heard mentioned. The action isn't too intense, not like Labyrinth of Evil. Obi-Wan seemed a little too \\"green\\" of a Padawan and not as sure of himself as he was in Phantom. And there are some red herrings thrown at us about Senator Palpantine that only distracted and didn't enhance the story. Qui-Gonn is at the center of most of the story and much deserved. I thought that he was a cool character who, in Lucas fashion, was cut down before we could get to know more about him.<br /><br />If you are looking for an okay Star Wars book and want to find some more info about what happened behind Phantom, then this is your book.	2005-02-22

I would have preferred a little more characterization - but that's me! There were some minor characters that seemed to be used to either fill space or try and emotionally involve the reader. I'm not sure if they were needed. We got the whole thing that war is bad and nasty. We got the sheer tonnage it takes to supply a war. We got the whole antidotes about war but what I wanted more of was really getting into the characters and their plights in this battle. It would have been really cool to if the bad guy had been Grievous. He's much cooler than the guy whose name I can't even remember other that the fact that he was a banker and is now a military general.<br /><br />This is a good book if you are looking for some Star Wars action. I would have liked to have seen the result of Anakin's Trials (if you know what I mean because I don't want to give the plot away) but for some odd reason, that was not in the book. I'm not sure if it's even somewhere in the comics or novels. Alas, it is another thing that Lucas has chosen for us not to see.<br /><br />That said... let the Force be with you.

Sean Steward could give lessons to old Sir George Lucas about how to construct a story and get into the heads and hearts of characters. He gives us Dooku and Yoda as flesh and blood not cardboard cutouts. He gives us two wonderful Padawans and their masters. The scenes with the Padawan tournament are amazing. Asajj Ventress is fantastic and evil and just kicks total but. This is a tragedy on a Shakespearean level in that these characters are doomed to destiny. If you are a Star Wars fan and the recent movies have let you done, leap into Dark Rendezvous without abandonment and, I promise, you will not be let down. You will only love the little green guy (not Kermit) even more and perhaps see Dooku as more than that guy with the crooked lightsaber and an impeccable beard.<br /><br />BTW, this should have been in hardcover and Jedi Trial in paperback.
