This one right up front lets you know it is a collection of short stories unlike 1633 which was about 4 short stories intermixed haphazardly throughout the book with about 3 or 4 hundred pages of boring history and old plane safety and flying. <br />The stories in Ring of Fire introduce new people and have occasional appearances of our heros and heroines from 1632 - some of the stories happen before 1633 and some after 1633. A few of the stories even had some of the joy and adventure which made 1632 so good. It was a nice look back into the Mr Flint's 1632 time frame by many authors but did not really advance the overall series much. <br />Hopefully Mr. Flint will re-engage and put some effort into writing a real sequel.	2004-01-02

Either Kindan is mentally challenged or they need better proof-readers and editing; some whole paragraphes seemed repeated; Kindan seemed to learn Nuella's secret twice, plus Kindan explained at the beginning of the book to his freind about the watch-wher going in-between, knew nothing about it in the middle of the story and later in the story knew it again. <BR>Overall, the story was good and I enjoyed revisiting Pern - the ending had a nice little twist but could have been a little longer cleaning up loose end.	2003-12-09

Dr Felix Rossi, his sister, the maid and particularily Sam was well done. The story plot is  some blood is recovered (stolen) from the Shroud of Turin and Dr. Rossi works on making a clone of Christ. Of course some people do not want that to occur and the press wants front page coverage. The story moves on at a good pace and is an interesting read. However to me, the book's ending fell flat; I think it needed about 20 or more pages and with more resolution. I doubt if there will be a sequal because there is not enough story left for a sequal without it becoming a religious book.	2003-01-24

Kirk and Picard vacation together on Bajor first planning to arrive by doing a plantary orbital skydive and then assist with an archaeological dig in progress. Problems already start on the dive down and get worse as the leader of the dig is killed before their arrival and of course Kirk and Picard get in the middle of everything risking their lives. But during the quiet periods Kirk tells Picard of his first major assignment and of the start of his and Spock's freindship (about 40% of the book). The main story gets resolved well but the story Kirk tells does not because I think it is the intro to his next book coming out. <br />For those that have not followed the original Star Trek from the begining and throughout. Kirk is still around in the new Start Trek time frame because he disappeared in some kind of time thread and was thought dead for around 75 years and was brought back by Picard in the movie and latered seemingly died but was returned to life (a book by Shatner). Spock (an ambassador at large) is still alive since Vulcans have very long life spans; McCoy is a very old admiral having had 100 plus repacements and grafts; Scotty is still around having locked himself in a perpetual loop on his ship's transporter when his ship was trapped and he was much later released by Gordie on the Star Trek Next Generation.	2003-01-24

Although I considered the plot and story mediocre as alternative histories goes - the superb job he did making Shakespeare as a main character into the story was great - showing outstanding research and implementation. I am not sure it will fly with the majority of alternative history buffs, but if you enjoyed Shakespearen stories, the Shakespearen time, or even the movie &quot;Shakespeare In Love&quot;, I think you would really enjoy the story.<br />The differing history is based on the Spanish Armada having won and Spain having ruled England for about 10 years with both the Spanish and English getting a little complacent with the way thing are. The story then revolves around Lieutenant Lope de Vega (former Spanish playwrite assigned to watch for treason in the theater) and Shakespeare who is hired by loyal English rebels to write a play to incite rebellion in the populace and who is also hired by the Spanish to write a play honoring their King Phillip II.	2002-12-08

The main character is again Mark Beamon, an older and slightly used up FBI agent put out to pasture as Special Agent in Charge at the Phoenix office. He gets pulled into a complicated case by his former partner Laura Vilechi who has been placed in charge of finding a missing rocket launcher held by Yasin, a powerful Afghan terrorist. The case gets much more complicated involving Volkov, a powerful drug lord and other drug dealers, the mafia, CIA bosses, and his own FBI boss.

This one has a good story and tied up the connecting thread of the series - which was imminent war with the Klingons and a medically altered Klingon posing as a recently acquired recruit on the Enterprise with the mission to kill Kirk. The main story of this sequal is the Klingons want to steal Dilythium Crystals from a newly settled planet located by an almost deactivated star base. All the usual Star Trek main characters do their thing and in this series the lower level security people are highlighted.<br />Very good series - should be read in order.	2002-09-05

Although it could be read without reading the first of the series, I would recommend reading them in sequence. The first book was good but this one is better, since their is more interaction between the crew and more action is encountered. Kell is still on the Enterprise and considering how to complete his mission of killing Kirk but he is having second thoughts. The main action in this books revolves around protecting the third planet of System 7348 possessing a non-advanced population from the Orions (employeed by the Klingon) that are destroying the planet to extract Dilithium crystals. However, interacting and helping the natives of the planet make Kell rethink again.<br />Although good, I found bad that is this book just feeds into the third (the first in the series more finished a story with just the series subplot open). Secondly, Kell makes choices and decisions and seems to change them much too easy.<br />I'm really looking forward to the third and final.	2002-08-19
US	52958571	R3H22ILESBKO5K	0399148701	17508097	Red Rabbit	Books	3	13	18	N	Y	OK but below par for Clancy	This book occurs early in Ryan's career making it a diffcult story to write as everyone knows the history of Ryan and most of the main characters at the CIA from all the books he has written occurring later in time. Clancy has done a good job of squeezing it in, however, since this has happened in the past and is not significant enough to discuss in the future, the scope and importance of the situation had to be on a smaller scale so it is not much of a story and it is almost lost in his detailed telling. Also some sentences and a couple of paragraphs seem to be repeat multiple times - better editing should have been done. <br />The main story is the KGB wants to kill the pope and the subplot is the Foleys starting their Moscow tour as head CIA there and trying to get out a supervisor in the KGB's main encryption group, whose main reason for leaving is that he was assigned to handle the communication for killing the pope and disagrees with it. It is a good story but below par for Clancy - I would have been really disappointed if I had paid the premium cover price, but at Amazon's discounted price it was a fair read.	2002-08-18

The book starts with two diplomatic missions one to England headed by Mellisa and Rita and the second to France with a continuation on to Holland headed by Rebecca. Julie and Mackay goes to Sweden visiting Mackay's dad and spend the whole story dealing with their sick kid and the dad's medical conditions. Mellisa and her group spend the whole time in England discussing history and killing fleas. Almost all of the book then is setting up the ending with Cardinal Richelieu plotting and the Americans getting prepared. <br />I did enjoy reading about the main characters again, the people of 1632 interacting with them and the modern equipment, and the new stuff happening. But what I found terribly disappointing about 1633 is that it wastes so much of the book contriving for characters to explain the current and future regular history and explaining how having the Americans back in that time and having access to history books changes things (GEE, MAYBE) - we hear it from the French, the English, the Spanish, the Dutch, the Swedish and even more history explained by the American's again -- painfully BORING, that should have all been covered by 2 or 3 pages of prologue and then almost all of the book slowly setting up the expected big conclusion which turns out to be a fairly small ending because most of the big conclusion is in the next sequel(s) - plus a whole lot of excessive pages on extra detailed flying info. All these boring chapters should have been used on giving us the big ending, more action, more on the main characters, and some expansion on interesting lesser characters and subplots that were started and never pursued (I did enjoy the extra pages spent on developing the characters of Mr. Simpson and his wife; but I wanted more on Gustav's daughter, Quentin'sdissension, on the treason and subsequent new intelligence and counter-intelligence service, etc., etc. - there was so much good stuff to write about - why all the junk  filler).  <br />It seems like; Mr. Flint wrote way less than half of the book - as only some portions had the action, zest, humor, and enjoyment that was seen throughout 1632. It seems like 9 writer got together and tried to deliver this baby in 1 month even though it has been over two years since 1632 came out. The majority of the book must have been written by others who had not even read 1632 and only knew the history of the time and the main characters names and how to pilot a plane because in many chapters the people seemed bland and out of character and some chapters seemed not to fit (probably something to do with futures sequels)-- plus the author(s) watered the story down to get a 1634, 1635, 1636, etc out of it. But all in all, I still enjoyed reading the book - particularly the last part -- but mostly, I was very disappointed, it should have been so much better. 1632 earned four stars, I had a hard time giving 1633 one star (after finishing the first 75%, I was wondering how to assign negative stars). <br />1633 has the serious fault that most alternative history stories make in that they waste so many pages first contriving conversations on telling the regular history, then more explaning how their timeline switch will cause a difference, then they tell a short story of the different timeline, and then go on to explain how it is different -- so the reader ends up with a book with a short story intermixed with a majority of boring filler talk. 1632 had little filler and did not waste time with diseases either while 1633 was way more than half filler and had a bit on illness and diseases; implying that future sequels will even waste more pages on illness, misery and suffering besides boring contrived historical conversations, so we will get even less action and plot advancement - very disappointing.<br />This book does not stand alone, nor tries to - it does not have a true ending, it just gives a convoluted narrative history lesson and sets up the next sequel; plus you need to have read 1632 before to understand it (but do NOT reread 1632 just before reading 1633 as I did - you may be less disappointed not remembering all the joy of reading 1632). If you really loved 1632 and its characters then I would recommend you read this book. If you didn't care much for 1632 - do not bother with this one. 1633 should be awarded the non-honor of Sequel with the Least Action and Least Plot Advancement of the year but I could have put up with that if 1633 was at least close to the fun romp that 1632 was.	2002-07-18

It had all the main characters return for a last bow. This story takes place shortly after the movie &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;. Kirk's 2 nephews and a lot of scientist are getting ready to go to a planet called Sanctuary and setup a peaceful colony and Kirk finally is convinced to go along. Of course he invited Scotty and Chekov (both of whom are not busy). Needless to say; he finds himself in the middle of a dangerous crisis affecting Star Fleet and millions of lives. Spock, McCoy and Uhura also come in to help.<br />Overall a very good story and I would reccommend it to all Star Trek fams.  They retried an old and novel concept with this book - they finished a story with a single book - we did not have to wait monthes to get 3 or 6 books to finish a story. I think that alone deserves an extra star and hopefully this will become a trend again.	2002-07-04

Kell's mission is to kill Kirk and disable the Enterprise because the Klingons are gearing up to resume their war against the Federation. There are also things happening at Star fleet command and on a Klingon ship where Kell's brother is stationed. How Kell doesn't gets detected when he is transported or when a tricorder is used by his landing party trying to find human settlers and Orion pirates is beyond me (although he does avoid exams by Dr McCoy) but I quess he can not be detected early for the story to happen.<br />I would recommend the book to any Star Trek fan as it was a good book with a somewhat stand alone story although the main thread will be continued into the other 2 books. My main objection was the somewhat excessive overthinking on Kell's part - granted some is needed but not that much. I also think it would be much better to have a bigger book with less filler than dragging it out as a trilogy, particularly since I am ready to read the rest of the story and have no ideal when I will be able to - plus I know it will then be the middle and I will still have to wait longer for the conclusion.	2002-07-03

Kirk and Spock decide to lay low so as not to conflict with their existing ship during the three days and go to recover a shore team they left on Tlaoli, but while there they encounter the Janus Gate. The Janus Gate is a very advanced combination time machine, transporter, and healing unit system left by a long gone advanced race. Sulu, Chekov, and Kirk get swapped out with different versions of themselves. Kirk with himself 19 years younger and Sulu and Chekov with 20 year older versions of themselves. As book 3 starts the Enterprise team has both Sulus and Chekovs with them and the younger Kirk. This book deals with getting the real Kirk back and trying to resolve the time conflicts, which makes an interesting story. However, with the alternate times (paralell universes? whatever) the story resolves the regular Enterprise, its crew and timeline but kind of ignores the second timeline/universe and I also wonder why only different one - seemingly the young Kirk and older Sulu and Chekov come from the same paralell universe - timeline but why not 2 or 3 different ones. <br />I enjoyed the book and if you have invested time in the first two - you need to read the third. If you haven't read the first two; do not bother to read this or them until you have read many of the previous books - prefferably where you get the whole story in one book.<br />Again as in the first book the blurb on the cover explaining the book has nothing to do with the story in the book.	2002-07-02

The story is as fast paced as usual and many of the same NUMA characters lend support such as Sandecker, Gunn, and Yaeger. He also gets help from the famous naval historian Perlmutter and run across a Russian rival counterpart Petrov, who Austin has crossed paths with before. The basic story is a very rich Russian, Razov, plots to overtake the government of Russia but before he does he wants to seriously hurt America which set Kurt Austin on his trail. <br />The story although good seemed a little more farfetched then his usual and the writing did not seem as clean as usual. Plus it did not have his usual quirk of Dirk having a short meeting with Mr Cussler passing thru going somewhere.	2002-07-01

This gets Stovic advanced to be a Blue Angel (one of his thoughts for shooting the MiG). Trouble is Ismael Nezzar (the brother of the MiG pilot) is a former terrorist that now decide he needs vengence on Stovic and of course the Blue Angels and America in general (even though he does blame the Algerian pilot for starting it). Much time, money and effort is expended on protection.  Kent Rathman (Rat) is the main protection, a very capable multi-agency worker that tries to keep Stovic alive and stop Ismael and his fellow terrorists, of course with the help and interferance of the FBI, CIA, Navy, police, etc. Rat would have been a much better main character and I would like to see more stories with him. There was also some subplot with the National Security Advisor Sarah StJohn, which I did not see adding anything of use to the story.<br />Over all a good book with a lot of info on the Blue Angels which I assume is true since Huston was not only a pilot but also a graduate of TOP GUN.	2002-06-29

I am really looking forward to book 3 to find out how all is resolved. However, Spock does give us a clue that they (the original crew) will not remember any of it after the time loop is corrected, but that has never happened before on many of their trips to the past - yet needs to as this series takes place early in their careers and they now have a lot of information they should not know.<br />Usually in most series, each book tries to tell a stand alone story, but this book (series) doesn't even try. It continues on right after the first book and ends on a cliffhanger ready for the third. Now we have to wait for the ending to come out. I see no reason why this should not of been a larger (probably more expensive) book instead of a series.	2002-06-19

Chekov, Sulu and Uhura are prime upper deck officers and have been well covered in many books; but there were about 3 others on the rescue team that had fairly good parts other than being the sacraficial guy in the red suit going down to the planet's surface. <br />The story is setup well - not only is this probably the Enterprises first of many trips back in time and the crews' experience of something sending them back in time travel but both happen. Kirk, Sulu, McCoy, and all are their usual great team with help from other crew. But, there is no end because it is a book leading into another series. Lately, all books seem to be coming out series - although some stories need the extra wordage; it is discouraging to buy a book and get a third or sometimes a sixth of a story - particularly when there is no way the book can stand alone requiring waiting and buying the rest of the series.<br />I also agree with another's comment. The blurp on the back of the book describing it seems to be about some other story and apparently whoever wrote the editor's review...only read the blurb on the back of the book also and did not even read the book; but that is OK as hte story described on the back sounded less interesting.	2002-06-18

This was not as good as some of Parker's earlier books, but if you are like me - a Spenser fan, it was great reading of Spenser, Hawk, Susan, Rita, Quirk and Vinnie again. The storyline is that the young pretty wife of an old rich man is blamed for his murder and Rita Fiore (widow's lawyer) hires Spenser to uncover the truth. Spenser in his usual fashion annoys people until the bad guy thinks he is getting too close and tries something, then Spenser is on the chase. I kind of wish that Parker had not diverted his time and effort on other endeavors like Wyatt Earp, Jesse Stone, and Sunny Randall books and kept the Spenser writing high. What I would really like is for Parker to write a pre-series book on how Spenser got in so tight with Hawk and Vinnie -- who are such serious dudes that it is hard to image them helping Spenser out as much as they do for free. I have read all the Spenser books, watched the Spenser TV shows and made for TV movies and about the only times Spenser has helped out Hawk is when Hawk has gotten into trouble helping Spenser.	2002-04-14

I really enjoyed the writing in this book and the detailed description of the school, the ice, and the people except for the main character.

The main character is Lydia (whose mother was killed when she was 15). She is now 30 and an crime author and crime consultant, having become famous on writing about the serial killer that killed her mother. Reviewing articles from the paper and TV, she sees another serial killer at work. The story line gets a little muddled in whether she is good or has some minor paranormal powers. She calls her long time freind Jeffrey (former FBI agent - now a private crime consulant) for help. Again the story is muddled with issues with him and her issues with the 15th annivery of her mothers death. All in all a great first book of a new author and well worth reading. I look forward to another story not so muddled.	2002-02-23

As I expected from the reviews, this is very similar to his previous book. Sending in the SEALs to get the job done, the weak president, his staff and the NSA (Admiral Morgan) still talking very politically incorrect.<br />Having said all that, I think it was an interesting and believable  story with the Chinese trying to expand and getting indirect help from Iran. I am sure the US would step in - maybe not exactly as done in the book though. Unlike others that thought the ending was not feasible and ruined the story. All you need to do is look at the way big companies and the government behaves and it is most likely the military does also - so I think the ending is very possible.	2002-02-18

Although the book does repeat a lot from the past books, I thought this one was better than the previous and moving the plot along and had interesting characters. I was hoping that we would resolve things but we have at least one more sequal to go.	2002-02-18

Occasionally it seems a little unbelievable, but then again look at the stuff we see in the news. <BR>The story is written around Quinn Barry, a new FBI hire, she is in a safe programming job and finds a problem. Trying to work through the channels she gets put down and transfered by her boss, she endeavors to solve the problem, first on her own then with help from a suspect. The case is extremely difficult because the real culprit is extremely bad, very talented and has help from government higher ups. The book ocassionally gets pretty brutal (torture and rape) but it is essential for the story and did not bother me. I would definitely recommend this book. However, I noted in some reviews that it did bother a few people - therefore, if you are easily offended - skip this book and find tamer material by always checking the reviews before reading a book.	2002-02-06
US	52958571	R15SQY6V2UJBVX	0738830658	343343222	The Crowning Circle	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Outstanding first try	For mysteries, I read authors Robert Parker, Thomas Perry, James Patterson, Patricia Cornwell, Sue Grafton, Janet Evanovich, etc and I think this book is right up at the top with theirs. <br />The story all happens in a small Ohio town and evolves around Skeet Cullum (a forensic psychologist) who inadvertantly and unwantingly gets his super hi-tech freind involved with many unsolved murders. Also, while working on these cases, they both have to expand and grow in their personal lives. The characters are fleshed out really well and actually grow and improve as people through to the end of the book and the plot moves with a nice pace that just makes you want to keep reading it. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is reading mysteries by the same or similar authors as I do.	2001-12-31
US	52958571	RR4J6L3Y9H4BA	0679453067	668170725	Pursuit: A Novel	Books	4	7	8	N	N	good but some places drag	I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who normally read Perry. For someone new I would recommend trying his Butcher's Boy or Jane Whitefield series first. This book seems to combine people with characteristic of Perry's more notable past characters -- a hitman (&quot;The Butcher's Boy&quot; - his first and in my opinion best book), someone smart and highly trained pursuing him, (&quot;Death Benefits&quot;) and women a bit like Jane Whitefield (many books). It was a very good story and I enjoyed it and would have given it 5 stars but there were some places that seemed to drag, particularily with all the hitman's overthinking and exercising details. As usual Perry does a good job of fleshing out his main characters and a few sub-characters - I really enjoyed the pursuer character (Prescott) and would have liked more about Millikan (prescott's freind - a professor and excop). Hopefully, we will see another book with Prescott and Millikan.	2001-12-26

I agree with other reviewers that Ashman was a great character but the author lost it and never finished the story which had a good start. Save your time and money for another book - try Steven Hunter &quot;Point of impact&quot; or &quot;Black Light&quot; or by Franklin Allen Leib &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot; or by Robert Littell &quot;Walking Back the Cat&quot;.	2001-09-06

If you liked his previous Pitt adventures you will enjoy this one.	2001-09-05
US	52958571	RLDPP74Q13NA5	0451457803	201826021	On the Oceans of Eternity	Books	3	2	5	N	N	Not as good as the first two in the series	This is the third in the series and I beleive the last. You almost need to read the first two &quot;Island In The Sea of Time&quot; and &quot;Against The Tide of Years&quot; to realy enjoy this one as the premise and most of the real character developement was done in the previous two, which is why I rated this only 3 stars while the other two deserve 4 stars. <br />The story is the continuation of the Island of Nantucket being sent into the far past and this book resolves the majority of the islanders taking care of the rogue element that is taking advantage of the natives.<br />I read the book 1632 by Eric Flint (which I liked immensely) and Stirling was recommended as an author who would also be liked, so I read his series. I felt Stirling's story (3 books) to be much meatier and more realistic then Flint's story, but if you enjoyed this series and time travel , DO read 1632 for a light enjoyable dessert.	2001-02-18
US	52958571	R1O6THQCP3JNIX	0671047310	644541461	The Third Option	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Very good	This book builds on his former 2 hits &quot;Term Limits&quot; and &quot;Transfer of Power&quot;. Although the book stands alone it helps to have read the previous ones. Both of which are also very good. <br />This book continues on with the story of Mitch Rapp who is a top notch spy/assassin. He is double crossed and returns to find out who set him up. Other characters from the previous books show up and have good parts. I think the story was well written and characters well fleshed out (maybe because I already knew them from the previous stories). <br />I did drop it a star because the book ended setting up another sequal (however I am ready to buy and read the sequal).	2001-01-30

I was pleased that it covered Bean and Petra more, but was disappointed that the book did not go in more depth about Ender's parent or Peter more. It also did not move the story along very far. It rehashes the Battle School kids getting to Earth and maybe a year or so of what they encounter (kidnapping and battles) and their reaction. It was like a half-sequal setting up two more sequals to finish the story.  If you love Ender and the kids, it is worth the read, otherwise save 20 bucks and wait to see if the next does more because in skipping this one you will not miss much of the story.	2001-01-23

Perry has a new character John Walker, not a professional like the Butcher Boy nor anything like his Jane series. I was glad to see Perry branch out and do new material, many of my favorite authors last year seemed to just plug out another sequal setting up another sequal. Though I would like another book about Walker. <br />Walker is pulled from his small cubicle at an insurance company by Stillman a &quot;trouble shooter&quot; and matures as the case proceeds and expands. At first he resists but since the case involves a former girl freind of his (who seems to be either setup or guilty of pulling of a 12 million dollar insurance scam), he feels the need to see the case through and prove her innocent. <br />All the main characters were well developed and the plot was rivoting. The end was a little quick and the FBI involvement a little weak but all in all a great story.	2001-01-23

As the title implies, The  Chinese go against the Russians and we jump in to help our Russian freinds.  I particularily liked the interactions in the White House and with other  government agencies and the battle descriptions. My only disappointment was  that even with the 1028 pages I still wanted more storyline about Clark and  Ding plus I wanted to know more about Nomuri and Ming afterwards. <br />A  great book that stands alone but is helped by prior knowledge of his other  books. I strongly recommend it for all Clancy fans but recommend new  readers to start with earlier books and read as fast as you can to get up  to this one.	2000-08-27

However, this one would not  stand alone as well as the others as it ties a lot of unfinished lose ends  together. We learn more about the Olivium and its thefts and again meet the  big black energy absorbing cloud moving through space. This was a well  written book and had more good interaction between the Start Trek crew. A  definite read for all Star Trek fans.	2000-08-21

It is better than a few of the previous books, particularly the third which was weak. As the other books, this book will stand alone but it is good to have read them all in sequence. The  stories thread together and manage to keep coming up with new and different  problems to be solved.<br />In this book, through a sneaky suicide run, the  Kauld contaminated the planet's soil early on in the fourth book unknown to  everyone on the settler's planet, which Kirk has heroically saved from  total destruction twice before. After a few monthes as the damage is  exponentially worsening, Spock detects the problem and the planet needs  saving again without much time to accomplish it.<br />This is another good  read for Star Trek fans with the famous chemistry between the Enterprise's  crew, plus a few other interesting character.	2000-07-26

I read it in less than two days, because it was very easy to read and was so entertaining it was hard to put down. It was like reading a newer and larger Connetticut Yankee in King Aurthers Court.  I then had to order my own copy, since I was reading someone else's  book.<br />It starts with a 3 mile radius hemisphere from present day West  Virginia (as if picked up with an icecream scoop) replacing a similar  section of land in Germany in 1632 during some bad war, aligning the river  and most of the terrain. The author only states it was done as an item of  art by some quirky advanced extraterrestial beings viewed as a &quot;Ring  of Fire&quot; by story characters and goes into a well written story of the  &quot;future&quot; common Americans adapting and interfacing with the  Europeans of the 1600's. Both plot and character developement is well done  and it is an upbeat book. <br />Although it was mild and short and I did not  find it the least bit offensive, I was a little surprised at what could be  called &quot;gratuitous sex&quot; in the middle of the book describing two  secondary characters wedding night (how could that be gratuitous?). This is  very unusually for Science Fiction, particularily in a light upbeat  story.<br />I really am looking forward to a sequal, as I am sure times will  get harder as more and more machines, equipment and modern things fail or  are used up. Plus I would like to see more about his interesting  characters.	2000-07-22

I was disappointed and hope he does not plan to go back even farther and do  Bob's grandpa -- it is getting to be a soap opera. Instead he should start  a new character or maybe have Bob's daughter go to Dessert Storm if he has  to keep it in the family.	2000-07-14

This book is 3 of 6, it can stand alone but it helps to read all in sequence. The main Star Trek character in the book is Chekov who with some help from  Uhura, Sulu and a little from Scotty try to help out the disgruntled  settlers on a new world that kind of blame the Federation and Kirk (who is  off world keeping space pirates away) for making things there worse. It  seems when you have trilogies, foursome and now a six book sets the Star  Trekness is waterdowned, but if you are a true fan you always enjoys  meeting your Trek freinds again. However, if you are not a Trek fan, I  would advise starting with the old shows, movies and books rather then  starting with this book.	2000-07-04

The main character is David Vandemark who acquires some psychic power (a little hard to swallow but it was fairly low key) and after his wife and  child was killed by a serial killer goes on a serial killer killing spree.  Of course the FBI is after him although the agent and later agents  naturally secretly kind of likes the fact he is getting rid of bad guys  that they can't get. All the main characters (Vandemark, 2 FBI agents, girl  freind, and bad guy) were fleshed out well and the plot was good and again  suprisingly the &quot;psychic&quot; power did not ruin the story.	2000-06-29

Cobra is the main character, a long distance shooter/assasin, but a good interesting fellow. I enjoyed the tie in to JFK and the life of  Cobra (I would have loved more details, at least another 100+ pages more).  Tolliver is the other main character and a man of problem that makes it to  the White House. The only thing I did not care for was the book's layout,  it started in 1963 for a few chapters than jumped to 1999 and while going  to 2000+ it interspersed chapters filling in some of the years between. I  like more sequential stories, but it still was very good and I highly  recommend it.	2000-06-15

Seawolf	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Good, but not as good as his last	I enjoyed this book and was glad Robinson added the last 38 pages that most authors would skip, namely there are consequences for mistakes and not all ends well. On the down side, I think there was a little too much filler  with the seals Special forces talk and action and he gave us breif  histories of too many seals, going into more depth for two or three  individuals would have been better. Also his NSA character does go way  overboard talking bad about races, religons, and nationality. I think this  is wrong, I prefered the way Clancy and others would have a lower level  person doing it with higher ups pointing out that the majority of these  people were good and they were being misled or kept in the dark about  things by a few bad leaders which all races, religons, and nationalities  occassional get.	2000-06-10

I would have prefered Ricketts (a spy like Clancy's Clark) to be the  main character or even Sami and to have resolved more of the Israeli behind  the scenes involvement which was setup but never finished and more on the  reasons and plans of the bad guys; instead we had more plane and helicopter  fighting. If you are into planes and shoot them up, it is a good read, but  I would not recomend it to serious readers.	2000-06-07
