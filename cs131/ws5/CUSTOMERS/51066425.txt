I spent a considerable time in a couple of bookstores and local yarn stores in an attempt to select which poncho pattern books were the best.  Having scoped out what I believe is everything on the current market, this one is definitely the best.  Why?  Well, there is a whole range of styles and designs.  In addition, the patterns, while of varying levels, are easy to follow.  This is the only one of the poncho books where, for me, the hardest decision is which one to knit -- there are several that I would love to have for this fall.	2005-08-12

The patterns are really original, but they also get those creative juices flowing.  I've been knitting about a year and a half and, while some of the patterns are too challenging for me at this time, others are really \\"doable\\" and present great ideas for future projects.	2005-08-09

I loved the Yarn Girls' Guide to Knitting, and was not disappointed with this one, either!  Once again, the Yarn Girls offer patterns which are accessible to beginning to intermediate knitters, and the results are great.  I am not an advanced or expert knitter, so the baby patterns in other books which are worked on size 0 to 3 needles sometimes seem a tad overwhelming.  The patterns in this book are quick and easy, but look stylish for the young kids for whom you always want to knit.	2005-08-09

There are some patterns in this book that are so simple that I felt foolish for being so \\"afraid.\\"  I'm thrilled with the instructions.  This is a really non-intimidating book for knitters who are just taking the plunge from scarves and such.  Also the basic knitting instructions are very clear.  I have referred back to them when I am doing projects that are not in the book.  (I also love their baby book, by the way.)	2005-02-10

I purchased this book hoping for creative takes on scarves, having gotten beyond the \\"basics.\\"  I have serious cautions about this book: (1) Unless you are very experienced, forget it.  The scarves are, for the most part very intricate and require way beyond beginner/intermediate skills.  Many of them are extremely complicated, and most look like they would take endless hours to complete. (2)  In addition to the required skill level, because the scarves are not clearly pictured, it is hard to visualize what they should look like on completion.  Again, a problem if you are not an advanced knitter.  That being said, if you are an advanced knitter and willing to attack intricate patterns, I am sure that this is a good resource.	2004-12-14

As with Barry Scheck's book, &quot;Actual Innocence&quot;, one of the most disturbing conclusions is that there are many more falsely-convicted individuals who never will be cleared because their alleged crimes did not leave DNA evidence behind.<br />The pictures in this book put a human face to the exonerated.  The simple, direct accompanying text and quotes from the former prisoners tell the story over and over.  I highly recommend this book in conjunction with Actual Innocence which discusses the causes of false convictions and attempts to articulate solutions to this ongoing problem with our legal system (even though it is one of the best legal systems in the world).	2003-12-14

However, I was admittedly a tad skeptical.  I was concerned that someone could really mess up this concept making it too religious, too one-dimensional, too a lot of things.<br />Although I ordered the book a few months ago, I finally picked it off my shelf a couple of days ago . . . and couldn't put it down!  Ms. Lankford has written a tight, fast-paced thriller which deals respectfully with multiple religions.  While one must necessarily suspend some belief, her efforts to accurately discuss and interweave medical and religious issues was wonderful.  The characters are well-defined and work together.  <br />I consider myself more spiritual than religious, but I can understand why some might see this concept as sacriligeous.  But this is really a &quot;non-denominational&quot; book that explores an intriguing concept, assuming the Shroud of Turin is what it claims to be.<br />I will look for more books by Ms. Lankford in the future.	2003-06-08
US	51066425	R1DZWAJNR7OG6P	0786889780	805394515	First Person Plural: My Life as a Multiple	Books	2	13	26	N	Y	Has not altered (no pun intended) my skepticism	First, this is one of the most horribly written books that I have ever read.  The author never saw a simile that he did not like, no matter how contrived and absurd.  (E.g. &quot;her eyes were all Monte Carlo; as sharp as the creases in a gambler's pants&quot;.)  At first I just stopped and rolled my eyes; later I would call a friend and read these absurdly dramatic excerpts so we could both laugh.<br />A friend suggested that I read this book when I expressed skepticism concerning MPD or DID, whatever name is assigned to the condition.  This book did nothing to change my view.  On the contrary, as other reviewers have noted, there is nothing to back up his claims that his &quot;alters&quot; were created at time(s) of alleged molestation by several people.  Nor is there any explanation for why these alters waited to show themselves until his late 30's, coincidentally when he stopped his endless suffering from a sinus condition which also made him the center of attention within his family. A little odd that a random pscychologist in a small town diagnosed him, yet he has trouble finding one to &quot;support&quot; his diagnosis when he moves to the San Francisco Bay Area.<br />There is little to no discussion of any credible supporting evidence for the &quot;causes&quot; of his personalities; any mother would be upset when her always attention-seeking son claimed she abused him.  His brother confirms nothing.   Nor is there any explanation for the adult alters.  The others supposedly emerged to shield him from abuse; what about the older ones?  Surely, given their natures as womanizer or sage elder they couldn't have been &quot;created&quot; by the mind of a small child.  <br />Don't get me wrong.  This guy has some severe psychological problems.  But I don't buy the DID.  It seems more like hype to sell the book.	2002-10-07
US	51066425	R1IEEE000AO6DB	039914739X	683788691	Isle of Dogs	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Nice try, but. . .	I am probably one of the few people who was not thrilled with this book, but finished it, nonetheless.  I have been a long-time Patricia Cornwell fan, so I thought that I should give it the benefit of the doubt.<br />Unfortunately, &quot;noir&quot; comedy is not always my cup of tea to start out with.  However, ISLE OF DOGS, is not just dark comedy but one that continuously slips into slapstick, childish humor.  To top it off, the characters are caricatures, each one less sympathetic than the other.  I would accuse Ms. Cornwell of portraying the minorities in a racist manner, except that she portrays the whites as badly as the rest . . . so I guess there is no discrimination there. <br />This attempt at dark humor is just not what we expect from Ms. Cornwell, and she does not pull it off.  Sorry, but I love the taught, intellectually stimulating Dr. Karpetta novels. I am willing to forgive and forget this &quot;slip&quot; . . . but will not continue to follow her if future books have the same tone and lack of intellect.	2001-10-27
US	51066425	R3HKK94GJK6D31	0786866586	574463302	Shopgirl: A Novella	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Thoughtful story	I'm not quite sure what I expected when I started to read a book by Steve Martin, but I was pleasantly surprised by &quot;Shopgirl.&quot;  The title character in this story, is an overqualified, bored glove salesperson who actually is an artist in her &quot;real life.&quot;  She is lonely and subject to severe depression when, into her life enters an older, wealthy man, lonely in a different way.<br />Even though this is a short book (hence the &quot;novella&quot; description), the main characters are well-developed, and evolve and grow over the course of several years.  As a former LA resident, I found the descriptions of the city and its social scene quite accurate and, although a bit of a fairy tale of sorts, the story seemed realistic.  I recommend this for an entertaining, short read.	2001-01-03

This is, by far, one of the best books I have read in a long time, leaving me sorry that it was over.  The writing is beautiful in its depiction of life, from the women's point of view, about 4000 years ago.  It was so incredibly moving that I found myself in tears at several times -- something that does not happen often!<br />This tale is a possible story of the life of Jacob's daughter, Dinah, who barely is mentioned in the Old Testament.  It starts with a recounting of Jacob's marriages to Dinah's mother, and her mother's three sisters, the births of the resulting children, and Dinah's youth, learning at her &quot;mothers'&quot; sides.  It continues with Jacob's departure with his family and flocks from the lands of his father-in-law, and follows Dinah through her death.  I don't want to say any more, because it would ruin the story.<br />The author does not suggest that this is the &quot;real&quot; story, or a &quot;supplement&quot; to the Bible.  It is not a religious book, per se, but does discuss the God of Jacob's father and, in contrast, the multitude of gods worshipped by other cultures of the time. The story is meant to provide a possible tale of an otherwise minor character, and affords a glimpse into the women's world of that time, not usually covered in the Bible.<br />I cannot recommend this book more highly.	2001-01-03

You can look up items by pattern, which are cross-referenced to the manufacturers' names.  The book is full of color photographs of makers' marks as well as examples of hundreds of patterns on various types of pieces.  The back of the book contains values for the photographed pieces.  Another helpful feature is the section on reproductions.  This is a great reference book.	2000-12-17
US	51066425	RWUK2EP4K6OUW	0399146687	239822085	Perish Twice	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	Not a bad sequel	After reading many of the earlier reviews, I have come to believe that those who do not like this book either (a) don't like the Sunny Randall character and/or (b) just don't like Robert B. Parker's writing style.  I, on the other hand, like both.<br />I am particularly impressed by the author's ability to portray female characters without making them all helpless, vacuous, or just &quot;men in pants.&quot;  This book is chock-full of female characters with totally different personalities.<br />As for the plot, this is a complex detective story which starts when an outspoken avowed lesbian feminist hires Sunny because she believes she is being stalked.  Two murders later, Sunny uncovers a series of interesting and ultimately related characters who have weaved the classic &quot;tangled web.&quot;  As she proceeds with her investigation, Sunny also counsels her insipid sister and emotionally-wrought best-friend.  While some might think that these side-stories do not belong in a detective novel, I found that these characters added to the development of Sunny's character -- maybe it is because I am a woman.<br />This is a very quick read which will keep you guessing pretty much until the end.	2000-11-27

This book is very entertaining, with complicated plot twists, but I can't give it five stars because it lacks the incredible technical forensic details of the later Rhymes books.<br />This is the first of the &quot;Location Scout&quot; books which Deaver wrote under a pen name.  The lead character, John Pellam, is a Hollywood location scout who is checking out locations with his partner in a small upstate New York town.  Pellam is fired after the death of his partner derails the film's shooting schedule.  Rather than retreat to Hollywood with his sorrow and tail between his legs, Pellam stays where he is to prove that his friend was murdered, and not the victim of a drug-related accident.  He meets a number of local denizens, some welcoming, and others not, in this curious village.  The plot is quite complex, and full of last minute twists.  <br />This was a good, quick murder-mystery-suspense story.  I look forward to reading the rest of the series as they are re-released.	2000-11-22
US	51066425	R1RBV7WLVMQ4II	0446525502	717558254	The Rescue	Books	3	5	5	N	Y	Predictable and too sappy	I am not a great fan of romances, but have tried to review this book without regard to my personal tastes.  I ordered it due to the very positive early reviews and, in fact, it was better than most romances I have read.<br />However, there were also many shortcomings which I think would be apparent even to most romance lovers.  The story concerns a single mother with a developmentally challenged son who are rescued in a storm by a volunteer fireman near a small town where she recently moved.  She is overwhelmed and driven by her need to teach and nurture her son, he is overwhelmed and driven by the past and the need to take on the most risky tasks in various &quot;rescues.&quot;<br />The story is very predictable and formulaic . . . no real surprise ending, although there are some ups and downs.  The narration gets bogged down in the characters' internal, repetitive musings.  You want to scream &quot;Enough!&quot; and &quot;Get on with it!&quot;  While the characters are somewhat multidimensional, they are too melodramatic and out of touch with their own issues -- all of which are obvious to the reader from the first few chapters.<br />I realize that this book is very appealing to some who like this genre, and are willing to overlook these flaws.  However, if you are not a major romance fan, you will probably be aggravated by this story.	2000-11-10

The most difficult thing that you will face when you receive this book is the decision as to which recipe to make first.  This book has a wonderful collection of diverse recipes from all over the world.  While some appear to have many ingredients, a closer review indicates that many are spices.  As a result, the recipes are quite easy to prepare and very tasty!  Buy this book if you like stews, and want some variety.  You will not be disappointed.	2000-11-09
US	51066425	RM5Q3RPKFHAZQ	0375705856	963629300	Plainsong	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Interesting snapshot of rural life	&quot;Plainsong&quot; is an unusual book in that you really feel like you have walked into a small town for a brief stay, in the middle of the characters' daily lives.  It is clear that significant events have occured and relationships have developed prior to your arrival, yet you are never sure exactly what those events were, or how the relationships formed.  Similarly, at the end of the book, not all of the loose ends were cleanly and neatly wrapped up.  As a result, it is like viewing a snapshot, or at least a video excerpt, of the characters' lives.<br />The book describes events in the lives of several people in a small town which appear, at the outset, mostly unrelated.  However, these stories end up woven together, as the characters lives eventually overlap.  The main characters are a teacher and his two young sons, a fellow teacher who takes a young pregnant girl under her wing, two elderly bachelor ranchers, and a school troublemaker.<br />I agree with other readers that there are some distractions in the book, primarily the author's affected failure to use quotation marks around spoken words.  There was no need for this unusual writing style; I, too, found that I had to reread certain paragraphs to figure out what was said and what was not.  However, after a while this becomes less difficult.<br />Otherwise, the book is well written and seems to be a realistic description of the ebbs and flows of a small Plains' town.	2000-10-27

It is amazing that a new novelist could pull off a such an intriguing and well-written book.  The story seamlessly flips back and forth between a chronology and past events.  While most of the narration is in the third person, first person observations by Amanda and her niece, Ruth, are interspersed.  Slowly, the hidden secrets which have forever impacted all the characters' lives are revealed, like peeling away the layers of an onion.  This kind of storytelling is difficult to pull off, but works marvelously here.<br />The story spans the end of World War I to the beginning of World War II, and remains true to the technological, societal and economic changes over this time.  The characters are complex and believable.  The central character is Amanda, who takes on raising her niece, Ruth, after her sister Mattie drowns under mysterious circumstances.  The story is tragic but nonetheless wonderful and, frankly, I held out hope for better times at the end.<br />I don't want to go any further, since I don't want to spoil the story.  However, as is clear from this review, I highly recommend it.	2000-10-13

This is not the &quot;Great American Novel.&quot;  However, it is a fun story with entertaining characters.  While some of it is a little predictable, this did not detract from the fact that is a fun and, in the end, uplifting book.<br />Samantha (&quot;Sam&quot;) has been married for about 20 years, when her husband, David, decides to move out and seek a divorce.  Sam is devastated, especially since David refuses to really talk about it (dare I say like most men?).  Sam's &quot;support team&quot; includes an outspoken, headstrong best-friend, her quirky mother, and a other entertaining characters who help change her life for the better.<br />This is a quick, fun, and even thought-provoking read about why we get into, stay and end relationships.	2000-10-09

In fact, during the first half of the book, my inclination was to give this book an even lower rating.  The second half was more interesting, but still could not overcome the problems with this book.<br />First of all, as other reviewers have noted, the writing is really cliche.  There was nothing creative about the prose, except the fact that the story is told alternatively between the first person (as Basil) and the third person.<br />Second, the main characters (except Windsor) are so vapid and self-involved that it is hard to feel any sympathy for them.  In fact, both Basil and Yancey (the formerly betrothed) have both concealed from each other such important aspects of their lives, and acted in such manipulative manners, that I found myself feeling that they really deserved each other.  However, I found the relationship itself hard to swallow -- why would Basil fall so hopelessly in love with such a shallow woman?  He doesn't imply it is her looks, but this seems to be her only positive attribute...  At least Yancey's attraction to Basil, his repeatedly-described manhood and his money, are obvious.<br />As I said, maybe my expectations were too high, and maybe I should have read the author's prior novels (which apparently involve some of the same characters) in order to feel some empathy for the characters.  However, the best attribute of this book is that it is a quick, unchallenging read.	2000-10-06

I seriously considered giving this book a lower rating, but it was not  horrible, just a waste of time given the plethora of well written books out  there.  I really don't understand all the other glowing  reviews.<br />&quot;The Carrier&quot; is a badly-written, far-fetched and  scientifically suspect &quot;medical thriller.&quot;  Don't get me wrong, I  understand the need to &quot;suspend belief&quot; when reading many novels.   However, the improbabilities and inaccuracies in this one hit you in the  face. To top it off, the characters are two-dimensional caricatures, none  of whom you end up caring about.  This combination left me eager to finish  the book, just so I could put it aside.<br />Also, will someone please tell me  where the editors are these days?  The text is repetitive (for example, he  &quot;explains&quot; several times how he (a) created and (b) is going to  &quot;fix&quot; the bacteria-gone-bad), there are disgraceful spelling  errors (&quot;affect&quot; used improperly instead of &quot;effect&quot;),  someone should have told him that active verbs are preferable, and the tale  contains rampant blatant factual errors (yes, the author is a man, but  couldn't someone tell him that 25 year-old women don't have &quot;regular  mammograms,&quot; let alone BEFORE being examined manually). These examples  may sound picky, but they are representative of the sloppiness which I felt  permeated this novel, and distracted from the story. Even the dates on  which the events supposedly happen don't add up.  <br />In any case, I would  advise &quot;passing&quot; on this book unless you are really out of better  books to read.	2000-09-07

The descriptions of Lahore and the  societal strata in modern Pakistan are captivating.  The author has crafted  captivating, multi-dimensional characters, none of which is perfect, but  each of which I felt drawn to, in a different way.  The story focusses on  our &quot;hero,&quot; who loses his job, and then makes a series of bad  decisions which compound on one another.  <br />This book is marvelously  written.  Every other chapter is told in a different style, from another  character's point of view (the alternating chapters are told from the  protagonist's point of view).  The changes in tone are extremely realistic,  and showcase the author's obivious talent.  <br />I found the first couple of  chapters a little confusing, at the outset, but they became clear as the  book continued -- in fact, when I finished the book, I immediately turned  to and reread the beginning.  I have never done this before.<br />I very  highly recommend this book, which is, in reality, a colorful fable.	2000-09-04

Also, the book had vivid descriptions  of the area and persons surrounding the Natchez Trace which added much to  the tale.<br />Anna has just assumed a management forest service job on the  Natchez Trace.  She is the first woman in such a position in this area of  the &quot;Deep South,&quot; and is subject to significant animosity on  several fronts, especially from her two long-timer subordinates.   Unfortunately, within days a local girl is found murdered in her  jurisdiction, under peculiar circumstances.  Along with her charming  counterpart in the Sherrif's office, Anna dives into the investigation,  although she has little understanding of the relationships and dynamics  among the locals.<br />This is not the most suspenseful page-turner that I  have read, although the mystery remains well-concealed until the end.  It  is, however, a very pleasant read.  I highly recommend it.	2000-08-22

It centers around  new-mother Brooke, and her pregnant best-friend Mary Rose, who is pregnant  by Brooke's cousin.  The characters surrounding these women are quirky and  wonderful.  While both women are enthralled by their children, they do not  glamorize the pregnancy experience, in and of itself.  Both the pregnancies  and the trials and tribulations of early motherhood are described in a  &quot;real,&quot; no-holds-barred, but humorous manner.

Walter Lutz is  morbidly depressed about his life.  He originally chose to work in the  non-profit industry and, despite his constant job moves, he realizes that  the goal of earning &quot;six figures&quot; is an unreachable brass ring.   He also feels burdened by his wife, two children, and their needs.  All of  this is magnified by his living in growing, affluent Charlotte, North  Carolina.<br />The story takes some bizarre turns, including his being held  responsible for an accounting error by his predecessor which he did not  catch for a few months, and his lack of success in his new position (I will  not &quot;ruin&quot; it by revealing the most significant developments).   While Walter's character is not very likable (you want to slap him and say  &quot;take some responsibility for your life&quot;), his wife is only  slightly more engaging.  As their life spins out of control, I found myself  vaguely interested, but not highly moved or drawn into the story.<br />This is  not a horrible book; in fact, several other reviewers have appeared to  enjoy it.  However, there are so many much better books out there, I would  suggest passing on this one.	2000-08-22

However, the reviews on this book  correctly led me to conclude that it is not a usual King book, and I  definitely liked it.<br />Nine-year-old Trisha strays off the Appalachian  Trail as she lags behind her arguing mother and brother, and then becomes  hopelessly lost when she tries to take a &quot;shortcut&quot; back to the  trail.  The suspense and tension in this book are those inherent in a story  about a young, but determined child, armed with a very small amount of  survivor knowledge.  For emotional support, she increasingly imagines that  her favorite pitcher, Red Sox's Tom Gordon, accompanies her on her trek and  provides her with guidance and support.<br />This is a wrenching story, as you  keep hoping that this poor child will be found, will escape the woods  unharmed, and so forth.  I found myself saying &quot;NO!&quot; out loud  when she made bad decisions, and encouraging her as she plunged  ahead.<br />This is a suspenseful and inspiring story.	2000-08-21
US	51066425	R3SNGYHWLQQGI7	0679774025	504166475	All over but the Shoutin'	Books	5	4	5	N	Y	Wondeful memoir	&quot;All Over But The Shoutin'&quot; is part memoir, and part ode to the  author's mother.  Throughout their tough life as very poor whites in the  Deep South (a trailer park would have been a &quot;move up&quot;), Rick  Bragg's mother sacrificed herself for the hope that her sons would end up  in a better place.  Bragg neither romanticizes this life, nor does he dwell  on the hardships.  Although he talks about having a chip on his shoulder,  the author does not whine, but simply trudges ahead with the conviction  that he can do what he loves, and do it well.<br />Rick made it out of that  hardscrabble world based on his writing talent.  Without a formal  education, he progressed from writing about local sports at a weekly  newspaper to, ultimately, winning the Pulitzer Prize for feature reporting  at the New York Times. The second portion of the book chronicles his  progress and travels in the newspaper business.  The chapter about his  mother's first trip on a plane to go to the Pulitzer ceremonies is  wonderful.<br />Beyond telling a moving story, this book is beautifully  written. Bragg has an amazing talent for story-telling; it is not  surprising that he is such a success as a journalist.  I cannot more highly  recommend this book.	2000-08-13
US	51066425	R2L6JJF3L9106X	0385496338	428029467	Ten Thousand Sorrows	Books	3	11	18	N	Y	Interesting, but not great, memoir	I am very torn in my evaluation of this book.  I don't want to appear to discount the tough times that the author suffered, first as a  &quot;mixed-race&quot; in Korea, then at the orphanage, then with her  ultra-religious adoptive parents and, later, in an abusive marriage.   However, as several other earlier reviewers have noted, there are many  holes in the story, and other &quot;facts&quot; which appear inherently  questionable.<br />This memoir appears to be the cathartic process of mid-life  psychotherapy, including childhood &quot;memories&quot; which may or may  not be accurate.  While the apparent (but unstated) dates in the book lead  me to believe that she left Korea around age 4 or 5 (see the cover photo,  taken in the US), her detailed recollections about her experiences in Korea  are too vivid.  Also, while her parents were wholly unprepared for adopting  a Korean infant, and apparently lacked any sensitivity, it is really hard  to believe that this toddler learned English in a few days and the piano in  a month.  As did other reviewers, I found her failure to refer to any  dates, and the lack of identity of her parents, ex-husband, or anyone else  to also affect some of the credibility.  (If she lived in a small  unidentified desert town, how did she end up so close to the beach when she  took her daughter out of school one day (in August? ) to go to the beach?)  Clearly, she must not have been trying to protect her adoptive parents  since they are still alive, and their friends and fellow church members  surely know who they are.<br />This memoir is interesting with regard to its  depiction of growing up essentially a non-believer in a Fundamentalist  Christian home in a small desert town, and the hypocrisy of her family and  church.  Her parents appear cold and cruel.  However, I am not sure how  complete these recollections are, especially in light of her present  perception that her parents have now made nearly a 180 degree turn in their  attitude.  Clearly, Ms. Kim has been psychologically scarred by her early  experiences (her admitted-self mutilation is a clear sign of a borderline  personality), but I was not left with the feeling that her story is  representative of the experience of other Korean adoptees.<br />Finally,  although Ms. Kim is a journalist by trade, this book is not very  well-written.  Many sections are repetitive, the story is hard to follow  because it jumps around chronologically, and the last psychotherapy section  is overall negative and written in a &quot;stream of consciousness&quot;  style.  Overall, this book would have been far more compelling if it had  been written in a more credible fashion.	2000-08-13

With due respect to him, his editors should have taken a heavier pen to this draft,  which was full of awkward writing and undeveloped points.  (The fact that  this work is so much briefer than Mr. Puzo's earlier works lends credence  to the conclusion that it needed to be fleshed out.)<br />That being said,  this was not a horrible book, but it was not what one would expect from  someone as talented as Mr. Puzo.  The characters were, for the most part,  two-dimensional and some of the relationships not fully clarified.  <br />Don  Aprile, who has survived the FBI incursions into the Mafia, is gunned down  by unkown assailants.  He has annointed the nephew that he raised as his  &quot;heir apparent&quot; to the remaning family businesses, as he  carefully has sheltered his children from the less savory aspects of his  life.  The story line was interesting but a little hard to follow (I didn't  think that the underlying attempted transaction made sense).  This is  definitely not the best novel written by Mr. Puzo.	2000-08-01

The students were urged to  ferret out &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot; and given almost free reign  over their decisions and punitive actions.  I agree with the prior reviewer  that this book brings to mind a real &quot;Lord of the Flies,&quot; and  would add to that the Salem Witch Trials.<br />Although their actions were  encouraged, at the outset, by their teachers, the students quickly turned  their attentions to their instructors and &quot;found&quot;  counter-revolutionary, &quot;bourgeouis&quot; and other improper behavior.   Nearly all the teachers were branded, even after the Communist party  instructed the students that most teachers should be considered good or  &quot;relatively good.&quot;  When the students ran out of teachers and  local petty officials to attack, they turned on each other, forming  alliances which accused their opponents of non-revolutionary behavior.  The  mounting violence and resulting chaos are, on a certain level, surreal.   The author's &quot;postscript,&quot; while brief, ties the account to the  present with its description of the &quot;where they are now&quot; of his  friends, and enemies, during this time.	2000-07-23

He accomplishes much of the horror through a brain-damaged man who he controls like a puppet,  and has been scheduled to commit machine-gun rampages at set times  throughout the day.<br />Deaver is a master at writing stories in which law  enforcement is forced to work in artificial time-constraints, in order to  prevent further disasters.  In this case, the FBI calls upon a retired, and  reluctant, questioned document specialist, Parker Kincaid, to analyze the  killer's ransom note, and aid in his capture.  This analysis was  interesting, but not as fascinating as the forensic work performed by  Lincoln Rhymes in other Deaver books (Rhymes, by the way, has a  &quot;cameo&quot; in this book).<br />While this was a very good thriller, I  do not rank it as highly as other Deaver books that I have read.  Despite  the tight time factor of the investigation, I found that the book dragged,  ever so slightly, at certain points. My criticism must be placed in  context, however: I enjoyed this book, and simply have high standards for  Mr. Deaver's work.	2000-07-23

On the contrary, they are significantly flawed, which lends to an interesting story.<br />Charles Davis is a once-heralded  novelist, whose recent works have received progressively less-glowing  reviews.  His wife hires a temp who she met at her office to assist her  husband organize his office.  When Charles discovers that the efficient  temp is writing her own, promising novel, he takes her under his wing, and  simultaneously pries into her hidden past.<br />While some elements may seem  predictable, the twists and turns make this a tight, fast-paced read.  You  are not sure with whom your sympathies lie at various points in the book,  which, to me, made the book very interesting.  This is definitely a very  good read if you like psychological thrillers.	2000-07-23

Although he initially declines, an ambivalent Armsterdam  becomes caught up in a complex mystery filled with colorful characters,  with elusive motivations.  <br />&quot;The Naked Detective&quot; is a quick,  enjoyable and colorful detective story.

It is great for someone who intends to vacation in lovely Steamboat, or who is new to the town  and/or hiking.  The directions are clear, and the maps are quite good  (accurate and simple enough to orient you well for the hike). As an added  bonus, there are quite a few full-color pictures of the area.<br />This is NOT  for someone who wants difficult hikes and/or who is already somewhat  familiar with hiking at Steamboat.  However, it is a great  &quot;starter&quot; which will familiarize you to the hiking alternatives  in the area.	2000-07-14

She is no longer works at a video  store, but has landed a job as a cameraperson in a network's New York local  station.  She becomes convinced that a condemned murdered has been falsely  convicted and, in turn, convinces the network's newsmagazine, &quot;Current  Events,&quot; to allow her to produce the story.  This proves far more  complicated than she had anticipated.<br />If you liked &quot;Manhattan is My  Beat,&quot; you will like this one.

This is the first book by David Sedaris that I have read and, for the most part, it was very funny.  During certain portions (I am ashamed to include one short scatological piece among them) I was laughing out loud.  Others  were very funny in a more &quot;dry&quot; sense.<br />The first portion of the  book is Sedaris' autobiography of growing up in a quirky family, dealing  with a not-too-successful speech therapist, and working (?) as an artist  and in other trades.  Next, he describes his stays in France at his  friend's house in the country and in Paris.  Anyone who has spent time in  France, and struggled with the French language, will be able to relate to  the humourous situations.<br />This is definitely a good book if you need some  chuckles and some loud laughs!	2000-07-13

While this may not be &quot;The Great Indian  Novel,&quot; it is a beautifully written story.<br />I see this book as a  &quot;coming of age&quot; novel.  The narrator has led a fairly isolated  life until he arrives at Benares to continue his studies after completing  his undergraduate degree.  There, he meets a number of European and  American expatriates, apparently his first true encounters with Westeners.  Their behavior and attitudes are so vastly different from his that he is  left puzzled, especially at the beginning.  The relationships that he forms  transform his life in ways that he could not have anticipated.<br />The  narrator describes different areas of India, and Indian life, from his  native point of view.  His descriptions of the cluttered city streets,  rural poverty and Himalayan beauty are viewed without the usual Western  &quot;filters&quot; in so many English language novels.<br />I think that this  is a beautiful and moving first novel.	2000-07-09

This novel is very different from the Lincoln Rhymes series, but is entertaining in its own way.<br />The  protagonist is a 20-year-old free spirit in Greenwich Village, currently  working in a video store.  She becomes a &quot;detective&quot; after she  finds a customer shot to death when she arrives at his house to pick up a  video, and then decides that the police is not working properly on the  case.  Her character shows both naivete and incredible spunk.

This achievement becomes the catalyst for profound changes  within her eccentric family, as her father shifts his attention to his  daughter's gift.  The now-ignored son proceeds on his own quest, the  distant mother continues certain hidden activities, and Eliza plunges into  hidden powers of letters and spelling.  I don't want to say much more,  because I don't want to ruin the story.<br />As strange as the characters may  seem, they become believable; each is well-developed.  The story is very  &quot;different,&quot; in a disturbing but moving way.	2000-07-09

It also was well researched, presumably, in  part because, before his death, the victim had hired a private investigator  to dig up the dirt on his ex-wife in preparation for a trial.

The book discusses the history of the Merrimack Valley in northeastern Massachusetts, weaving in stories about the author's parents'  lives there as immigrants from Italy and Lebanon.  It also compares  descriptions of the area written by Thoreau, and others, in the 19th  century.<br />While most of it was fascinating, some aspects of the book  bothered me.  First, as the book progresses, it becomes evident that it is  a collection of prior essays; some portions are repetitive, almost down to  the exact language.  Second, I felt that the author was trying too hard to  be &quot;lyrical.&quot;  Some of the writing seemed &quot;forced,&quot;  convoluted, and grammatically awkward, to the point that I had to reread  sentences to figure out what she wanted to say. <br />Despite these  criticisms, it is an interesting read about an area that has changed so  much over the last 150 years.	2000-07-03

My expectations were vastly superceded; it is clear  that the movie was unintelligible because (a) too much was cut out and (b)  there was an obvious effort to over-modernize it (the book was written  almost 20 years ago).<br />&quot;The Eye,&quot; a private investigator becomes  obsessed with a woman after he witnesses her kill a man who he has been  surveilling.  Unlike the film (which takes place over a relatively short  period of time), in the book he trails her for over a decade.

They also take a close look at what caused these wrongful  convictions in the first place.  The chapters discuss a whole range of  problems which lead to wrongful convictions from erroneous identifications  to &quot;junk science&quot; to overzealous law enforcement and prosecution,  and more.<br />The most sobering point is that DNA -- which only has been  useful for a few years -- can exonerate a prisoner ONLY IF the perpetrator  left a smidgen of his DNA behind.  Since this occurs in a small subset of  cases (rapes and some murders), there is no way to prove easily that  someone has been wrongfully convicted in other situations.<br />Rather than  just point out the problems which result in wrongful convictions, the  authors offer numerous suggestions, both throughout the text and in the  conclusion.  The most obvious one, which has only been adopted by a couple  of states, is that, whether or not you are for or against the death  penalty, executions should be suspended automatically until DNA evidence  can be reviewed, if available.

At times it is a tad disorganized, but it is such a quick read  that this does detract much.

This collection of interrelated short stories  together form a remarkable tale of subtle, and perhaps even unconscious,  redemption. Socrates becomes a mentor, best friend, and invaluable member  of society.  In addition, he learns that not all is black and white,  whether it be with regard to morality, or as between the races.<br />The  stories and their moral teachings are subtle, like well-crafted fables.

I applaud Steve Thomas for his courage in writing this book,and was shocked by the DA's conduct in this matter.  The story behindthis debacle needed to be told, and this was done undoubtedly at personal risk to the author -- if he is lying, he could be held liable for significant damages for defamation.<br />This book is chock-full of the facts involved in the investigation, and the evidence which leads to the conclusion that one or more of the Ramseys was involved in JonBenet's murder. (I disagree with Thomas that it was only Patsy, although I believe that she was directly involved.)  The completely baseless &quot;Intruder&quot; theory championed by the Ramseys was created by the DA's office, or the DA's office adopted the Ramsey's theory.  It is hard to decide which, since this book confirms that the DA and &quot;Team Ramsey&quot; practically worked as a single unit, with the DA handing over most of the evidence to the prime suspects.<br />Yes, the officers who originally arrived at the Ramsey house severely compromised the scene.  Thomas makes no excuses about this.  However, this book documents the tireless efforts by the JonBenet investigation team, which were continuously hampered by roadblocks placed by the DA's office.  It also discusses the attempts to secure assistance from the FBI specialists and others in law enforcement; these outside experts invariably supported the Boulder Police Dept., but were handled dismissively and/or ignored by the District Attorney.<br />I wish that there could be a resolution to this tragedy, but this appears unlikely.  The only partial &quot;resolution&quot; that I could see would come as a result of the Ramsey's threatened defamation suit against Thomas (on Larry King a couple of weeks ago).  Since truth is a defense, this civil case might provide some resolution, as did the OJ Simpson civil lawsuit. . . Let's see if they actually file it.	2000-06-16

The portrait &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring&quot; by the famous Dutch painter, Vermeer, apparently is considered &quot;the Dutch Mona Lisa&quot; because of the girl's enigmatic  look as she gazes at the painter.  This book tells a possible story  explaining the painting.  It revolves around a young maid who worked at the  painter's house, and who was enthralled with his work (and him). The story  takes place in the highly stratified and puritanical Dutch culture of the  mid 17th century. When I finished the book, I felt that I has just read a  beautiful fable.	2000-06-15

I gave this book 3 stars, because some of the overriding principles might be of value to a recent graduate.  I very well may have found some guidance from this book at that time in my life.<br />However, as someone just a tad  younger than Ms. Shriver, I learned little from her book.  Moroever, her  lessons are garnered from an unusually sheltered position.  Risks can be  taken, and certain choices can be made, when one does not need to work.   Her &quot;asides&quot; about her wealthy family (and spouse) become a  little irritating.  Also, while she undoubtedly had to work hard to get  where she is, she needs to stop trying to convince herself that her name  and connections didn't open any doors. . .<br />The writing, itself is not  exemplary. It has a really &quot;chatty&quot; tone, which became a little  irritating (especially the name dropping and the defensive &quot;I'm not  Oprah, you know. . .&quot;).	2000-06-15

Ruby is actually the widow of the rabbi of the local, small Jewish community in Eternal, Texas.

In fact, she confides to her daughter that Silvie is  meant to be an anagram of Elvis. The Elvis-date story, in its various  permutations, surfaces at several points in the story, and provides the  basis for Silvie's mother's ever-present discontent with her suburban  life.<br />As Silvie grows up in her mother's bizarre household, she attempts  to break away; ultimately, she moves to New York.  When her mother is  diagnosed with cancer, Silvie's world is turned upside down, as she tries  to reconcile her relationship with her mother and find out the  &quot;truths&quot; and &quot;whys&quot; about her and her mother's life.<br />I don't usually cry when I read books, but the tears flowed around the  end.	2000-06-15

When Richard's mother passes away, and he  culls through the bric-a-brac of his parents' lives, he learns about his  parents' past, and the choices that they made.  At the same time, he  commences a relationship with another lover of &quot;junk&quot; who is  demonized by her job at an animal shelter, where she is required to  euthanize animals on a daily basis.  Richard's efforts to assist her come  to peace with her personal torture also bring him to peace with his choices  in life.	2000-06-15

It seems that, instead of getting repetitive, each of the Lincoln Rhyme/Amelia Sachs thrillers is getting better.  In this one, Rhyme and Sachs are asked to assist a small town North Carolina police department in  a volatile murder/kidnapping by an odd local teen known as the Insect Boy.   (Rhyme is at a nearby UNC campus for experimental spinal surgery.) By  taking them out of the &quot;safety&quot; and familiarity of New York, this  book takes a fresh look at the forensics the pair use to track down  criminals, and provides new challenges.<br />This story takes more twists and  turns than any of the prior Rhyme/Sachs tales.  Every time I thought things  were about to slow down, there was another bizarre turn of events.  Read  this if you want a fun page-turner, which you will find difficult to put  down!	2000-06-14

The attrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge, which resulted in large-scale genocide of the Cambodian people, have not received the attention that they warrant from the Western press.  This book describes  the horrors of the Khmer Rouge's brutal rule, from the view of a woman who  was only a five-year-old girl at the time the Khmer Rouge invaded Phnom  Phen.<br />As young as she was, the author showed incredible courage and  determination.  I have always wondered why some people survive in such  horrid conditions; this book provides some insight into the will-to-live,  and refusal to give up which kept this woman alive.  <br />The descriptions of  her family's suffering are graphic, but no more than necessary to provide  the reader with an authentic feeling about the torture, starvation and  other maltreatment by the Khmer Rouge, as led by the &quot;invisible&quot;  but revered and feared leader, Pol Pot.<br />By the way, a complementary book  about this epoch which I recommend, told by a woman who was a few years  older, is &quot;When Broken Glass Floats.&quot;	2000-06-10

Rather than being  redundant, I found that this book complemented the other.<br />Both girls  were daughters of relatively privileged families who were part of the  forced evacuation of Phnom Phen.  The author of this one, Ms. Him, was a  few years older, and this slight age difference provides some different  perspective. In addition, Ms. Him's family evacuated in a different  geographical direction, which also affected her family's displacement over  those years.  The author shows how, as a child, she demonstrated incredible  determination and courage in the face of the most horrendous conditions  imaginable -- she even escapes one work camp as she was near death from  dysentary.<br />This book provides another necessary and compelling  autobiography of a horrible time in history.	2000-06-10

The Coffin Dancer is  known for his creativity, adaptability and persistence (you cannot change  your mind once you have hired him).<br />The book's rapid pace, pulls you into  the frenzy so that you feel like you are there, watching Lincoln and Amelia  work toward their goal.  As with the previous Lincoln Rhyme book, Deaver  includes meticulous detail concerning forensics, primarily the recovery and  analysis of trace evidence; I'm not a scientist, and cannot evaluate the  accuracy of these descriptions, but they are fascinating.  In addition, the  ending caught me totally by surprise.<br />I ended up reading this book in  almost one sitting . . . until late in the night, something I don't often  do.  A great Summer read.	2000-06-09
US	51066425	R3YDGG65ZA3L7	0375406530	663303744	Waiting	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Waiting -- for something to happen	&quot;Waiting&quot; is an appropriate title for this book, as I kept waiting for something to happen.  The protagonists fall in love, but must wait 18 years for the man to divorce his wife from an arranged marriage,  because of the legal limitations on divorces at the time.  Throughout this  lengthy courtship, nothing much happens between them. <br />The tale in  Waiting supposedly spans the Cultural Revolution, and a few years after its  end.  What bothered me most about this book was that it almost ignores the  realities of life during this oppressive time in history.  The portrayal of  life is unrealistic, based on what I have read.  The &quot;harshest&quot;  thing which we hear about is the almost voluntary &quot;confiscation&quot;  of a few books (leaving many more behind).  Otherwise, the Cultural  Revolution appears to have no impact on the story.<br />The interaction  between the characters is interesting since they reflect views of both  &quot;traditional&quot; and Maoist China. However, the book drags, so much  so that I found myself waiting (with the &quot;lovers&quot;) for something  to happen.  At the end, your sympathy for the primary characters vanishes.	2000-06-07

The story focusses on the life of Ninah Huff, a young girl who has grown up in the compound of the Church of Fire and  Brimstone and God's Almighty Baptizing Wind.  Her grandfather founded the  church after a falling out with another congregation, and most of the  residents are related to one another.<br />Grandpa Herman imposes upon his  flock extremely strict and often bizarre &quot;laws,&quot; the origin of  which is a little hazy, but which govern and control the actions and  thoughts of his followers.  Punishments are designed to remind  &quot;sinners&quot; of Christ's suffering, and include sleeping in a grave  or with nettles sprinkled in the sinner's bed.  Meanwhile, the followers  wait anxiously for the coming &quot;Rapture,&quot; spending time primarily  in church or toiling the fields of the compound.<br />Ninah and another young  church member fall in love, and the repercussions of this romance  ultimately impact the entire congregation.  While there are some tragic and  disturbing scenes, the ultimater changes (a figurative &quot;rapture&quot;)  are moving.	2000-06-07

There is an obvious cultural divide between the old-timers who continue to till the communal  land, and the younger generation who toil at the plant.  However, none of  them seem to fully comprehend the ticking time bomb which looms in the  distance.<br />The horror of the Chernobyl accident, and the mishandling of  the situation by the Soviet government, are disturbing.  When one of the  elder women of the town finds herself alone in Kiev after a governmental  evacuation, she determines that she has no real alternative other than to  return to the poisoned village, where others soon join her.<br />I couldn't  put this book down.  The characters are fascinating -- especially the  tenacious old women who have seen so much hardship their whole lives.  Their strength shines through, as they treat the radiation poisoning as  just another hurdle in their lives which must be  overcome.<br />Coincidentally, I finished reading &quot;The Sky Unwashed&quot;  on the day that the Ukranian government finally agreed to close down the  remaining reactor... Hopefully, the rest of the harm can be repaired.	2000-06-07

I kept hoping that it would become more interesting, and that I would develop some feeling or empathy for the characters.  Instead, I had  to force myself to finish the book.<br />The principal problem with this book  is that most of the characters are cliche and two-dimensional.  The only  multi-dimensional character, the protagonist, Jo, is unsympathetic.  She  seems to bottle up her emotions, and then act in an extremely self-centered  manner.  While I was curious regarding the &quot;whodunit&quot; portion of  the book, the resolution was not believable, and I found myself really not  caring for the people involved (except,maybe, the murder victim and Jo's  husband).<br />In an interview with the author at the back of the edition that  I read, she said, in effect, that she liked the story, but had a hard time  writing it, and did not relate to Jo.  I believe this explains why the book  drags, is repetitive and tedious.<br />I note that some readers appear to have  loved this book, but others had sentiments similar to mine.  Maybe this it  either &quot;clicks&quot; or does not &quot;click&quot; with you.	2000-05-30

Billie Letts has a talent for creating quirky and mostly lovable characters that complement each other.  We would all be lucky to know the people who become Novalee Nation's &quot;family&quot; after she is  abandonned, and gives birth, at a Wal-Mart. Each of the characters, in his  or her own way, teaches Novalee valuable lessons about life, trust,  friendship and love. While Novalee encounters many difficult hurdles in her  life, the book is an enchanting and inspirational tale of someone becoming  more than anyone could ever expect her to be.  <br />By the way, the movie,  while it cuts out large chunks of the book, is still very good. If you've  seen the movie, buy the book.  If you read the book, don't be  &quot;afraid&quot; to see the movie.	2000-05-19

Both authors are Oklahoma residents, and write about people living on the  fringe.  Like Ms. Letts, Ms. Park also creates vivid characters, although I  did not find all of those in &quot;Bingo Queens&quot; quite as developed.   However, the interaction between these individuals -- some more empathetic  than others -- was believable and engrossing.<br />The both tragic and  inspiring story centers around Darla Moon, daughter of the town whore, and  aspiring dress designer, dying to leave the small &quot;town&quot; of  Paradise for greener pastures in New York.  Darla's courage, independence,  loyalty and love for those around her carry her through a series of trials  and tribulations.<br />I agree with at least one of the other reviewers that  this novel takes a while to get rolling, although I'm not quite sure why.   However, I could barely put it down for the last two-thirds (the first  third would generate a less-than-five-stars rating).  In fact, part of me  wishes that the author would write a sequel, because I'm dying to know how  things turn out.  <br />The author is to be commended for her compelling first  novel.	2000-05-17

However, this book is much more than that.<br />This is really an expose of  the development of medical theory re gender and identity, and the  &quot;nature vs. nurture&quot; battle within academia.  The arrogance of  the doctor who insisted that he could be raised as a girl based on a mere  circumcision is maddening.  His obfuscation of the actual dismal failure of  his experiment was criminal malpractice.<br />It is tragic that a child was  forced to undergo such successively callous events of medical malpractice,  first with the incompetent circumcision doctor, and then at the hands of  Dr. Money.  One can only hope that he has found peace with his regained  identity, and that other children will not be submitted to similar torture.	2000-05-14

As with the others, this one was a fun, pleasant read, but I kept having the feeling that, during some portions, it  was &quot;deja vu all over again.&quot;  For example, there is an entire  section on truffles and truffle hunting, as in at least one of the earlier  books.  While there are some new vignettes with regard to this special  fungus, a lot of it seemed repetitve.  I almost felt that I would have  gotten the same enjoyment by rereading one of the earlier books.   <br />Despite this criticism, there are some new stories, and the book was  enjoyable, like its predecessors.  I just can't give it a higher rating  because of the lack of originality.	2000-05-14

I loved &quot;Where The Heart Is&quot;, and looked forward with anticipation to this book -- I was  not disappointed.  As cliche as it may sound, this was another book which I  did not want to end.  <br />The story centers around &quot;The Honk&quot;, a  diner operated by a parapeligic Viet Nam Vet.  Ms. Letts creates a blend of  distinct and (mostly) lovable characters, including some  &quot;regulars&quot; of the diner and a couple of people who appear and  become the catalyst for change. Ms. Letts leads the characters through a  whole range of life events, which leave you with the entire range of  emotions.  In the end, you are left with the feeling that these people have  formed a family of their own, probably with stronger bonds than  &quot;real&quot; families.<br />If you loved &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;,  you will love this book.  I hope that Ms. Letts is writing another book, as  we speak!	2000-05-10

However, what could have been a really fascinating story, became an agonizing read because of the author's awful writing (not that expected  from a Harvard professor).  Not only does he use tortured grammar (perhaps  from reading too many German source documents), but the story is told in a  haphazard, stream-of-consciousness manner with little organization.  He  constantly digresses, which further disrupts the account.  While some of  the digressions are interesting, the way that they are thrown in detracts  from the story.  This could have been a wonderfully fascinating read, but I  felt that I had to pull myself through it.  The story itself is compelling,  but needs serious editing.	2000-04-24

Blind Eye is a page-turning story, the scariest part of which is the fact that it is true.  The lack of fail-safes and protections from dangerous, let alone incompetent, physicians in this country is frightening.  (In  fact, without revealing anything dramatic from the book, a striking fact is  that the medical establishment in several African countries was more  effective than in the U.S.)<br />The only portion of the book which I felt to  be lacking was the section on Dr. Swango's psychiatric profile.  The  analysis was somewhat simplistic, and left me with more questions than  answers.  I would have liked to see a more thorough discussion and  diagnosis of his complex sociopathic character.<br />Nevertheless, this is one  of the best books I have read in a long time.	1999-09-10
