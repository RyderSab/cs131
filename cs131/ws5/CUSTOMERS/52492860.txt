US	52492860	R3JTO7NBVI0ANO	0060011483	499848218	The Chocolate Ship	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Lack of Character Development	The premise of this book sounded great but because there was a lack of character development it was hard to understand what motiviated some of the characters.  The author went overboard in her description of every single detail of the cruise and the settings instead of focusing more on the characters.  There was also an overabundance of primary characters making it hard to keep track of who was who.  I thought the book was okay, but would have a hard time recommending it to others.	2003-03-18

The storyline jumped around a bit.  The scenes never connected, which in turn made me feel disconnected from the book.  I couldn't get into the story and finally I just had to hurry through it to get finish with it.  It's not a bad book, but there have defintely been better ones by this author.	2002-02-06

I don't understand how she could place all the blame on the breakup on Jeff.  She seemed to refuse to take at least some of the blame.  The book is reading more like a pity party for Sheila.  I also agree with the other reviewer, in that they are taking way to long to get together.  I really enjoyed Alice Woodson's other book (Snowbound with Love) and would highly recommend that one.	2002-01-16

I thought that it would be more of historical analysis of each fraternity/sorority, but yet it was nothing more of a dry recitation of facts  The information that was presented is available on each sites website.  I was looking for a more comprehensive view of each organization.  There was also a number of errors throughout the book, that have been reported by other reviewers.  I give the author props for tackling such a tough subject, but it just fell short of what I expected.	2001-08-02

It focuses on Marissa who only dates married men and the threatening phone calls that she beings to receive from one of the wives.  I thought I had figured out who the stalker was, but I was thrown by the suprise ending.  This is one book that you will not be able to put down.	2001-07-19

This family went through many trials and tribulations, but manage to stick together and hold on to their faith in God.  It proved to me that God doesn't give us more than we can handle.  I feel that this is Mrs. Roby best work to date.  She deftly handles the issues of domestic violence, and caring for an elderly parent.  Issues that we all can relate to.	2001-06-21

Needless to say, I agree with the majority of the reviews.  This book was horrible.  It had absolutly no plot, the poetry inserted after ever chapter was unnecessary.  And why did Omar Tyree think it was necessary to make himself a character in the book.  Totally unncessary.  Tracy didn't grow as a person, like I thought she would.  Instead she stayed a spoiled and needy person.  I wish that I would have checked this book out at the library, instead of buying it.	2001-06-11

Unfortuntely, the characters seemed to be stock characters at best.  I could never get a feel of the characters, therefore, I could not get into the story, nor  sympathize w/their situations.  The problems that they faced were more  appropriate for the 1800's than the year 2000.  The romance between Honey  and Stephen felt forced and stiff.  I just did not enjoy this book at all.	2000-05-07
