Wealthy, beautiful, stylish and privileged, she spends most of her time trying to disguise the fact that she is one serious scholar who does not fit the mold of a 1950's woman.  Hers is a life of dicotomy, on one hand she is a slave to the fashions of the day spending copious amounts of time (and her father's  money) on being the best-dressed and most elegant young woman possible; while her internal dialogue reminds us that even the most outwardly privileged have their demons.  As other reviewers have stated the fact that this novel was written by a man speaks volumes to the author's skill in nailing a female voice.  Gloria's journey to eventual maturity is a fascinating one, and this novel provides compelling insight into a thankfully by-gone era for women.  I especially enjoyed Gloria's eventual \\"revenge\\" on her father's creepy colleague, a truly horrid character if there ever was one. 4.5 stars.	2005-10-12

It really isn't a \\"haunted house\\" story at all, more like a time travelling possession story.  I say this because the \\"haunting\\" if you can call it that is not limited to the house, but rather inhabits the characters of the story who travel around and do some very nasty bidding on behalf of the house (or should we say on behalf of Jack) The premises of time and ones perception of it were very thought-provoking, but the actual rationale behind some of the events just didn't ring true.  I agree with another reviewer who mentioned the killings of some of the characters that came totally out of left field with absolutly no motivation behind them.  Now don't get me wrong, there are truly disturbing scences here, and many that are fraught with such a level of misogyny that some individuals may have a hard time reading them.  But as a lover of ghost stories, there is a real difference, between being shocked or repulsed by what I'm reading, and being scared by it.  This one covered the repulsion factor just fine, but it sure didn't keep me up at night.  I'm going to suggest \\"The Ghost Writer\\" by John Harwood as a much better example of the genre.	2005-09-18

I was however pleasantly surprized by some very witty writing, quirky but lovable characters and a genuinely entertaining story.  This one looks like \\"chick lit\\" at first glance, but don't be off-put, there is some strong writing here, and a fine little story to boot.	2005-08-23

While the writing for the most part was quite good (although if the author made reference to a Catalpa tree one more time I was ready to scream), the characters, however sympathetic never really engaged much of my interest.  While I could feel for their various plights, I, hard-hearted reader, never really cared all that much about them.  I have to say that I enjoyed \\"Memory of Running\\" by Ron Larty, a novel with a similar feel far more than this effort.  I would try this author again as I feel he does hold promise, but this one just didn't shine for me. 3.5 stars	2005-08-02

Family secrets abound in Rebecca's tale; a witty, humourous story rife with 70's and 80's nostalgia and some very memorable characters.  Rebecca's search for passion and meaning in her life is well worth a read.  She is sometimes a rather hapless character, and her cold fish of a husband is totally annoying, but Rebecca will ultimately find what she needs most in some very untraditional and wonderful ways.	2005-06-28

I can't pinpoint it but while reading I just kept thinking, \\"I've read this story before\\", there was nothing fresh here and very little that kept me engaged.  I did find the sex scenes between Daisy and Duncan rather creepy and I'm no prude.  I also agree that the ending was a let-down and did nothing to help me enjoy this story.  Overall, I would recommend readers take a pass on this one.	2005-06-11

I haven't read such a compelling, suspenseful, literary chiller in a very long while.  As other reviewers have stated if this type of story (a sophisticated ghost story very much in the Victorian tradition), is your thing then you will certainly find this novel \\"un-put-downable\\".  The mix between the narrative and the insertion of the haunting and connected \\"stories\\" is superbly crafted, rarely have I seen it done better.  As many other reviewers have already stated, the ending was not up to par with the rest of this story.  The author did not do this story justice by finishing his novel with such a hurried, confusing, let-down of and ending.  If nothing else you should read this story just for \\"The Revenant\\" alone, that one will stay with you for years. 4.5 stars.	2005-05-31

Once you get past the fact that he is a hard-drinking, chain-smoking, nearly 300 pound boy/man complete with Vietnam war wounds, recently deceased parents and a schizophrenic sister, whats not to like?  Some might find this story sappy and predictable, I found it heartbreakingly touching and uplifting.  Yes, this is the story of Smithy's \\"quest\\" across America on his bicycle; but it is equally his sister Bethany's sad and haunting story as well.  Anyone who has lost a loved one to the ravages of mental illness will feel the tragic emotion in these pages.  I came to care about Smithy and Bethany and quirky Norma.  And while the ending was somewhat predictable I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.	2005-05-26

My favorite by far was \\"Put a Lid on It\\". David's description of his sister's apartment was so funny it left me howling, and the book is worth reading for this story alone. \\"Baby Einstein\\" and \\"Repeat After Me\\" are also priceless in their hilarity.  If you love David Sedaris, this work will not disappoint.	2005-04-26

When it comes to men and whether or not they are \\"into\\" a woman, we gals do make it far more complicated than it needs to be.  Men are sexually motivated, men who do not want to have sex with you are NOT into you.  Really, everything else Greg says should be required reading by all women/girls prior to entering the dating world.  It would save us all alot of heartache and humiliation.  Honestly ladies, men like to pursue, if they're not, then you know your answer. Okay there are shy men who may require a \\"nudge\\", but honestly any guy who's received the \\"signals\\" from a woman he's interested in will be like a dog with a bone (eg. all over it and not willing to let it go!)	2005-04-23

It can be done successfully (try reading Fair and Tender Ladies by Lee Smith), but it can also run the risk of having a one-sided, self-centered feel as it sometimes does here.  It's not that our main character is without merit.  She's witty, smart and ferocious in her sister's defense.  Some of my favorite letters were the one's written to her sister's medical team; the kind of letters we have all wanted to send, but never had the guts to.  I did however find myself skimming through many of the letters, and I do agree with the other reviewers who noted that it just did not seem plausible that a globetrotting movie exec would be taking the time to write lengthy hand written letters.  3.5 stars	2005-04-14

It demands careful attention, that and a pad of paper to keep all the characters and their various nicknames straight.  Without this forethought the story could easily be construed as confusing and convoluted.  It may not easy keeping all the details in order but once you do the result is immensely worthy of your time.  Mathilde is a wonderful heroine, loyal, witty and relentless in her pursuit of the truth.  Just the kind of gal you would want on your side.  This gripping story of devotion and fearless determination coupled with the insanity and cruelty of war is a must read. 4.5 stars	2005-04-07

The mere concept of putting together a mismash of found notes, letters, cards, lists etc,means that there will be some duds amonst them, but there are also many that are hilarious, terrifying, touching, profane and downright bizarre.  It's one of the oddest cross-sections of the modern human experience you are likely to find. Some of my favorites were \\"Give me one too/July 19th (for it's eerie premonition of possible things to come.) All the notes left on improperly parked cars for the sheer hilarity brought on by major frustration(we have all wanted to leave these on a car at one time or another)And by far the best of the bunch \\"Aaron's Algebra Test\\"(where ever Aaron is now, lets hope he's putting that imagination to good use!)  Yes, there is plenty of foul language and sexually explicit content here so it's not a choice for your twelve year old.  It is however a highly entertaining way to spend a few hours.	2005-03-25

The story of Elizabeth and her life as an somewhat reluctant but deeply caring midwife in early 20th century Appalachia, is both heartbreaking and uplifting.  Elizabeth is the bastard daughter of a strong loving mother, herself a midwife in a long line of women crucial in caring for women during childbirth.  The reality of what the job sometimes entails is too much for Elizabeth to bear, and the scenes devoted to \\"midwife's mercy\\" are gutwrenching to read.  Elizabeth's heartfelt search for love and acceptance is tinged with both sadness and hope. An excellent read worth seeking out.  4.5 stars	2005-03-12

I enjoyed this story of longing, forgiveness and hope, but like another reviewer couldn't help thinking back to my own late stages of pregnancy and saying \\"no way\\".  Perhaps I'm being naive but for women in the latter stages of preganancy, issues of importance are food, sleep, and bathroom location. Taking a new lover is likely the furthest thing from their minds. Equally so are jumping on TransAtlantic flights for rather vague reasons, trapsing from Boston to New York in search of ones ner-do well- brother, and spending days painting and plastering....um.... not so much. That said, this is a sweet, hopeful story with some wonderful characters, and a storyline (however unlikely) that has you hoping that despite all the roadblocks, love does come for Verona and Zeke.	2005-02-23

Magical Thinking is very funny in places, but unfortunatly those places didn't come often enough for me. While Burroughs had me smirking, Sedaris has me spewing my coffee through my nose!  The funniest of the bunch was by far \\"Debby's Requirements\\", any of us who has felt held hostage by a cleaning lady can relate to that one.  Overall not a bad way to kill a couple hours, but for my money, no where near as hilarious as Sedaris	2005-02-21

These are not your typical chain rattling, spook filled, gorey tales.  For the most part these stories focus on the subtle line between the living and the dead, playing on our fears of the unknown, and leaving the reader with an overall feeling of disquiet rather than downright fear. These stories will have you pondering the possibilities rather than jumping at noises in the night.  My personal favorites were \\"The Trentino Kid\\", \\"Doctor Hood\\", and the very unnerving \\"An Amicable Divorce\\"  If you can appreciate a \\"thinking\\" reader's ghost story, these are the tales for you.	2005-02-08

The story of three women ( a doctor, a widow and a death-row inmate), and how their lives become intimately entangled one hot Texas summer, is both heartbreaking and strangely uplifting.  Forgiveness, retribution, lonliness and love in all its forms are told with an aching and unflinching voice.  An added plus to this story was the ending.  In my mind it was perfect, unexpected yet totally plausible.  This book does not disappoint.	2005-01-25

Life with a certifiable mother can never be easy, but the author manages to find humor in even the most heartbreaking situations.

All time travelling books require a complete suspension of disbelief, but this one just became too weird for me.  Whenever I'm reading about a 40 year old time travelling man appearing naked before his six year old \\"future wife\\" I can't help but be creeped out!  Plus the author seemed to make glaring factual errors that grated on me (eg. A Bellini cocktail is made with peach juice not pear, and since when did most cars in the late fifties/early sixties even have seat belts let alone ones that were actually used?)<br /><br />I found the dialogue cliched, the writing mediocre, and the characters just plain dull.

Author Ron Rash does not disappoint with this lyrical Southern Gothic murder mystery that is so much more than a crime story.  Told through the changing voices of the main characters this novel is rich with passion, tragedy and redemption.  It's also a fine mystery that will keep you guessing throughout, as things are rarely as they first appear in this story. Ultimately, the truths of the dead will return to avenge the lies of the living.  Worth seeking out. 4.5 stars.	2005-01-12

At first glance it may appear that the author has an axe to grind with the Mormon church.  Closer inspection reveals however that it's not the religion itself she has issue with, just the narrow-minded, paternalistic and hurtful way that faith has often been interpreted and applied (especially towards women).  I wasn't sure what I was going to make of this story, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  The author has crafted a compelling page-turner that keeps you hooked.  My only negative comment would be at times it came off too preachy and occasionally bordered on the melodramatic.  That said, still a worthwhile and suspenseful read.	2005-01-10

While I enjoyed the writing in this novel I cannot say with all honesty that I enjoyed the story.  In fact, it left me with an overall feeling of despair and distain.  We meet a number of women in this novel, most of them with the odd commonality of seeking out frequent, anonymous, often abusive sex.  These are not underpriviledged victims here, these are educated women (with the exception of one character still a teenage girl, whose story was by far the most troubling), women with options and choices. So why does all the sex in this book feel so wrong, so nasty?  These women have sex with men whose names they don't know, men they don't even like, let alone care about, over and over and over again. All they are left with are blurry faces that disappear before morning, leaving behind unwanted pregnancies, venereal diseases and a whole lot of angst.  As I read this novel, I kept saying, why??.. Why would these women continue to subject themselves to this, what point is the author trying to make here?  That as women we are compelled to \\"fill\\" ourselves up with men, in the most literal sense of the word.  That in the \\"filling\\" we will do some \\"finding\\"?  Sorry, I just don't buy it, empowerment and fulfillment does not have to come at such at painful price for any woman.	2005-01-02

It is however satirical and one must remember that with satire the brush strokes are broad.  I kept wanting to say, no that's not how it is in the burbs, only to reign myself in and enjoy the ride.  Besides who of us has not met a perfect \\"Mary Ann\\" mom, and who knows whats really going on behind the closed doors of those idylic looking homes.  As another reader stated, the novel does have a kind of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" feel to it (although not quite as over the top).  Well written and enjoyable.	2004-12-17

Welcome to the unhappy world of the Chase family.  The tragic death of the youngest son Ronnie five years earlier has shaken their lives to the core, but that's just the beginning of the bizarre path they are about to follow.  I won't reiterate the plot, suffice to say the author keeps the reader so unsettled and engaged that it is difficult to put this one down.  The characters here are beautifully drawn.  It speaks to the author's talent that we come to care deeply not only about the main players, but also about the secondary characters, even though we are given only a brief glimpse into their lives.  The only thing preventing me from giving this novel 5 stars was unfortunatly the ending felt somewhat rushed.  That small issue aside, this is one of the best reads of 2004.  4.5 stars.	2004-12-07

The atmosphere created around an upscale neighborhood of BMW's and martini drinkers felt remarkably current and not at all dated.  In fact our society is likely even more enamored today with the trappings of the wealthy than when this novel was first written.  This creepy story focuses on a new house built in an established well-to-do neighborhood. Although the reasons are inexplicable, the house itself is hell bent on wrecking havoc on the individuals who reside within it's walls.  There are no ghosts here, just a malevolent force bent on destruction.<br /><br />Told from the perspective of the couple who live next door, this novel provides a different take on the traditional haunted house genre; that of the observer not the resident.  My only minor criticism of this story was that the ending felt somewhat rushed given the build up.  Still, a worthy book if your looking for a late night read.	2004-12-02

Imagine being a teenage girl growing up in a place where all things sterotypically \\"teenage\\" are forbidden. No media, dancing, movies, rock n' roll, drinking,  the list goes on and on.  As Nomi describes it being a Mennonite is \\"to belong to the most embarassing sub-sect of people if you are a teenager\\"  Which is not to say that Nomi doesn't rebel, she rebels with wild abandon.<br /><br />Nomi's narration while often hilarious, is tinged with a palpable sadness.  Both her mother and elder sister have fled their small rural town for parts unknown, leaving Nomi to fend for herself with her loving but painfully inept father. As Nomi's family members abandon her what seems like a cruel reality does indeed become \\"a complicated kindness\\"  This is a lovely novel that will linger with you.

If you take a quick look at the reviews for this novel to date, you will notice that there is not a bad one in the bunch.  This wonderful, hilarious, poignant novel is a joy to read, pure and simple.  The year is 1985, and our awkward, lovable hero Brian finds himself trying to adjust to his first semester at university.  The trials and tribulations of Brian's life and loves make for some of the funniest prose I've read for a long time.  The author nails the mid eighties time period, along with those painful years of young adulthood.  You'll be thankful you're not eighteen again, but you'll be smiling all the way through.  I loved every page of it!	2004-11-01

For the most part I find them overhyped, and patently disappointing.  Not so with this refreshing little foray into the engaging world of domestic intrigue that is the detective agency of one Mma Precious Ramotswe.  Lovely evocative writing, wonderful characters and a simple yet intriguing story.  What more does one want in a bestseller?  I was so taken with the first installment that I shall certainly be reading the entire series. 4.5 stars.	2004-10-28

A needy, high maintenance girl who blames most of her problems on the fact she is beautiful, pairs up with an eager, devoted man who feels he never quite measures up to his stunner of a wife.  The fireworks are inevitable, and the sparks do fly.<br /><br />While Chloe pursues a high powered career in finance, Jack  plays the role of struggling writer.  His time at home allows him to become inappropriatly entangled with the odd residents of their apartment building, while Chloe pursues her own brand of misbehavior at the office.<br /><br />Wonderful writing, remarkably well developed characters, a witty and believable plot, this novel would as others have mentioned, make a fine movie<br /><br />It's impossible not to enjoy riding along with this train-wreck of a marraige as it hurtles toward it's satisfying crash ending.	2004-10-20

Raised by loving but distant parents, who, consumed with their own medical careers often treat childrearing as an afterthought.  The family is kept running by Maureen, a kind of hired familial major domo, who ensures everyone is where they should be when they should be there.  Denny's adulthood is both fulfilling yet lacking, and that sense of \\"something missing\\" pervades the pages.  Life does not always deal one the hand we expect, and resiliant characters like Denny fill this novel with a quiet grace.  This story does not disappoint.	2004-10-12

This is one of those stories. It's a wonderful, frightening, meander through the dysfuntional childhood/adulthood of one Southern boy.  There are shocking, horrific passages here, expertly interspersed with ones of great humor and joy.  Occasionally the novel borders on the wordy, and in spots was often repetitious, but these minor faults in no way impact the power of this story.

I felt for the character of Sara; young and intellegent with nothing but promise and success maped out in her future, she finds herself deep in the throws of adolescent love with a boy from the &quot;wrong side of the tracks&quot;. An unplanned pregnancy results and Sara for all her intellegence childishly chooses to ignore things until too late. She proceeds with an open adoption which of course we know is headed for disaster. I thought the issues of maternal devotion and insecurity(by both the birth and adopted mothers), were accurately portrayed and painfully realistic. The birth father appears to have no interest in the child and although Sara is forced to move on with her life, she is never fully able to let go of the baby she left behind. The book provides a satisfying conclusion (no sugar coating here), on what is a complicated and emotionally laden issue. There are no winners here just a oddly comprised &quot;family&quot; struggling to make a life for themselves. A few of the characters were fairly weak (Sara's parents were paper thin, and Danny's mother was a little sterotypical), but overall a good effort by this author.	2004-07-29

Frank is busy living a rather banal existance; thoroughly dissatisfied with his lot in life and compleatly unmotivated to do anything about it, we meet Frank in the final stages of the extramarital affair he is about to end.  It's hard to hate Frank because while he seems shallow and self-absorbed his genuine bewilderment with life, combined with his hilarious and politically incorrect reactions to the tragedy that unfolds, makes him in an odd way, highly likeable.  A witty and satirical novel with a good dose of black comedy thrown in, Among the Dead is worth seeking out.	2004-06-29

A fortysomething, chain-smoking, scheming &quot;ner do well&quot; with a trust fund and a death wish; his distain for women is obvious even though he shamelessly pursues just about anything in a skirt.  Despite his often loathsome treatment of those around him, the reader is also privy to Hugo's scathing wit, insighful intellect, gourmet musings, and occasional bursts of humanity.

It's always a pleasure to come across an author that is endowed with both gifts. Keeping Faith is a highly readable, thought provoking look at religious dogma, family secrets and modern relationships.  What would you choose to believe if confronted with the unexplainable?  Can true religious miracles exist in this age of doubt?  Picoult does not try to steer us in any one direction, just poses the questions and provides the fodder for thought and discussion. For that she gets 4.5 stars. My only negative comment pertains to the point of view, which jumps between a third person and first person narrative.  I often found it confusing and rather offputting and would have preferred a consistent type of narration.	2004-05-25

If you are of an age to remember when you could leave your house in the morning and disappear for hours without concern, you will love this novel for the wonderful sense of nostalgia it will no doubt bring.  The merit for this novel is not purely based on sentiment however; it is one fine horror story that hurtles the reader along at breakneck speed.  Full of fine scares and boys we all knew as children, this novel does not disappoint.  4.5 stars.	2004-05-07

I found myself laughing out loud many times while reading this odd but fascinating book.  Early on the author states that Stiff is not about the process of dying or the loss of loved ones which are decidedly unfunny topics.  It's all about the curious things that human kind has done with the dead over the centuries.  Yes, much of it is rather gruesome but it's written in such a humourous and tasteful way as not to be offensive (strange as that may sound).  This is not subject matter that most people would be apt to admit an interest in, however there must be a reason there are so many popular &quot;morgue&quot; shows on TV.  While certainly not for everyone, if you've ever been curious about the &quot;lives&quot; of cadavers, this one will not disappoint. 4.5 stars.	2004-04-23

The themes of wartime occupation, collaboration, and resistance as seen through the eyes of children is unique and moving.<br />My problem lies with the characters themselves, it was difficult to sympathize with any of them even through their times of hardship and tragedy.  Mirabelle the cruel, migraine prone mother was a bitter shell of a woman. Framboise, far too calculating and spiteful even in light of the harsh treatment meted out to her by her mother.  The siblings never held my interest and were left rather underdeveloped.  I did think the plot twist near the end was well done, although again it did nothing but reinforce my lack of affection for the siblings.<br />As a small aside, another reviewer commented on the silly names of the characters and I would have to agree. As someone who lives in a English and French speaking country I have never heard of Francophone's with these type of bizarre names.  It also seemed odd that someone with the strange name of Framboise would then name her own children with goofy food names (after nuts no less), when she was so desperate to remain anonymous.  Not a bad book, but for me it's hard to love a book and not care about the characters. 3.5 stars.	2004-04-15

The abuses this mother subjects her child to are unthinkable and there are many passages in this memoir that will make your skin crawl.  The author tells her story in such a matter of fact way that at times I found myself wishing I could crawl into the pages to rescue this girl.  Even though it was obvious the author's mother had suffered her own horrible abuses as a child, it was difficult not to despise this woman to the core.  It is amazing that the author survived this nightmare of a childhood.  Her memoir makes for a powerful and disturbing read. 4.5 Stars	2004-04-08

It's anything but. Sixtysomething school teacher Barbara Covett's life appears to be a bitter, dull affair. She is contemptuous of both her colleagues and students, and appears to be little more than a lonley, friendless spinster.  There is however a lot more going on with the mild mannered Barbara than may be evident at first glance. When she meets Sheba Hart, the new art teacher, Barbara develops what could only be described as an &quot;unusual&quot; attachment.  The married forty year old Sheba has her own secrets as well.  She's carrying on an illicit affair with one of her students.  Barbara's growing attachment to Sheba is both fascinating and disturbing, and the novel is both scathingly funny and highly literate(you may well need to haul out the dictionary a time or two).  Barbara may be a mousy &quot;old bag&quot; (as she describes herself), but for my money she's a force to be reckoned with.	2004-04-05

Jim Kokoris's debut novel \\"The Rich Part of Life\\" is an all time gem of a book, and if you have not read it you should.  That said it is always with a sense of trepidation that I approach the sophomore effort of an author when the debut is so beloved.  Is it possible to live up to the reader's expectations when the first book was such a delightful reading experience?  Jim Kokoris certainly has a way with quirky characters, sort of a less outrageous John Irving.  Sister North is no exception to this and is peppered with lovable oddballs.  Sam is a shallow, disillusioned Chicago lawyer who's life has taken an unexpected turn for the worse.  He heads out on a road trip of sorts to track down Sister North, a wise talking nun whose calm, clear advise is dispensed on the airwaves. Once Sam arrives in the small town that the Sister calls home, his life becomes intertwined with an unusual cast of characters.  Does Sam find fulfillment and hope in this most unlikely of places?  Perhaps.  Did this reader love this effort as much as The Rich Part of Life?\\", sadly, no.  A good second effort, and highly readable, but the sophomore curse seems firmly in place.	2004-03-31

While the story is often humorous and makes for an entertaining read, there is a darker undercurrent prevalent in this novel. The author touches ever so subtly on a variety of subjects that often had me re-reading passages to make sure I understood just what she was saying.  A fine effort for a first novel,I look forward to reading more from this author.	2004-03-22

You don't have to be a fan of Stephen King to appreciate this biographical look at the craft of writing.  Love him or hate him, it's hard to argue with his success or deny that the man knows how to tell a story.  He devotes the first part of this book to the story of his childhood and young adulthood, with plenty of trials and hilarity thrown in. He moves on to the craft of writing itself, offering in his words &quot;no bull%@*$&quot; about how to write a story.  He ends with a harrowing look at the accident that almost killed him, along with his own list of favorite books.

The woman is literate, funny and tells one hell of a story. \\"Disobedience\\" is no exception to this.  Filled with the quirky, amusing antics of the Shaw family, Hamilton creates characters you want to know.  When mother Beth Shaw's extra-marital affair is discovered by her email snooping son, the Shaw's lives become an open book.  Herein lies my problem with the novel; the voice of our narrator Henry, the son in question.<br />Henry is a seventeen year old boy, albeit a witty, intellectual one, but a teenage boy none the less.  While Henry's dry observations had me laughing out loud on many occasions, a voice inside my head kept saying one thing over and over.  \\"This is great writing, and I'm enjoying this story, but this is not how a seventeen year old boy talks or thinks, this is the voice of a middle aged woman\\"  In her quest to be literary, the author has made Henry's narration far too mature and urbane to be believable. Even the most sophisticated seventeen year old would not have the life experience necessary to form the types of opinions on sexuality, infidelity and marraige that Henry is apparently capable of. While the novel is enjoyable and worth reading, Henry's voice never quite rings true.	2004-02-21

The intimate look at the lives, loves and hardships of two &quot;sisters&quot;, Sudha and Anju makes for poignant and entertaining reading.  Whenever I read a book about Indian women, even in modern soceity, it always re-emphasizes how different and difficult the lives of women in other cultures can be.  While some themes are universal to all women(love, marraige, children), the expectations, rules and traditions that govern women's worlds are vastly diverse.  This is a great story to curl up and get lost in.	2004-02-21

Set in Norway in the mid-nineteenth century, Dina's life is from an early age, fraught with tragedy.  Her mother is killed in a freak accident when Dina is five, and in his grief her father sends her off to live with another family.  Dina returns wild, unruly, and most unlike the women of her day. She is married off at sixteen to a friend of her father's, a wealthy land owner named Jacob. Her life as the new mistress of the estate is tempetuous to say the least.  No one really seems to understand Dina, and few are able to get close to her.  After her husband's death, Dina realizes she is pregnant, and so adds the duty of mother to the responsibilities of running the businesses of the estate.<br />Dina's trials and tribulations make for very interesting reading. Dina however is not an easy character to sympathize with. So while I ultimately enjoyed this well written novel, I never warmed to Dina(quite the opposite in fact).  She may not be a particularly likeable character, but she is a memorable one.<br />4.5 stars.	2004-02-01

The Lost Diaries of Iris Weed is a well-written page turner with one of the most unlikeable characters I have encountered for awhile.  Professor Jason (Lars) Larson is a smug, arrogant, self-serving womanizer, with a semester worth of new conquests awaiting him each year.  His long-suffering wife tolerates this behavior for her own reasons, and the couple is blessed with a young daughter whom they adore.  When Lars encounters student Iris Weed, his world begins to turn upside down.  Lars finds himself obsessed and lustful over this unusual, headstrong, young woman, who does not play into his hands as he expects.  When Iris turns up dead, the police begin to focus their suspicions on Lars, who knows much more than he is revealing.  The ending takes a nice twist and the story is suspenseful and satisfying.  It would rate 5 stars if only for one thing; Lars' character is so unrepentant that I found myself wishing bad things to befall him too.	2004-01-16

A powerful and provocative look at the world of addiction, complete with a cast of characters undoubtably being chosen by Hollywood as we speak(I'm hoping for James Gandolfini in the role of Leonard) The author's unconventional style of writing does take some getting used to, but it keeps you on your toes and adds to the overall feel of unease.  In many ways this novel is like a bad car accident, you are repulsed and fascinated at the same time. This book speaks to the stranglehold of addiction and offers no apologies for the author's unorthodox philosophies on recovery.  It's certainly not to everyone's tastes, but there is no denying the author has captured the essence of something that most of us will be fortunate never to experience.  4.5 stars	2004-01-12

The question of what you would do if your could live your life over with all your present knowledge intact is both fascinating and gut-wrenching.  So for story idea itself &quot;Replay&quot; gets high marks.  The writing however does tend to get bogged down in a new-age eighties kind of way.  There were certainly some &quot;cringe worthy&quot; passages that unfortunaly left the story with a rather dated feel to it.  That said it's still worth a read and does provide much to ponder.  3.5 stars	2004-01-10

He's a sensitive, self-depreciating twenty-year-old who just happens to be able to see and communicate with the dead.  Odd's unusual &quot;gift&quot; has left him with a rather heavy burden to bear; the ability to commune with victims of crime (and hopefully find their killers), as well as a knowledge of  future tragedies.  This foreshadowing of danger is made clear to Odd by his ability to see &quot;bodachs&quot;, malevalent, spirit-like creatures who thrive on impending doom.  Odd's quest to discover and avert an unknown disaster is well written and interesting, but I did feel the ending was somewhat rushed and underdeveloped. Odd is such a unique and likeable character however, that perhaps we could look forward to his appearance in a sequel.	2003-12-31

Imagine this, you are a 47 year old woman happily married for over 20 years with two grown children, a job that you adore and a husband whom you love deeply. One day you are blindsighted with the information that your husband is leaving you for a younger woman.  And not just any other woman, she's your trusted co-worker, and by the way you are out of a job too.  This is the hand that our heroine Rose is dealt early on in the novel.  How she copes with the destruction of her marriage and her struggle to find her identity makes for some interesting and entertaining reading.  While some of the scenarios may have been a little too predictable, and I often felt that Rose was far too civil to her estranged husband and his lover, this novel makes for an enjoyable read none the less.	2003-12-14

Rachel and Ned lead an ordinary life in a small New England town.  A happy family of three, their teenage daughter Kate, a source of pride and joy.  Then inexplicably their daughter's behavior begins to change from normal to highly disturbed, especially after Kate learns of her mother's pregnancy.  A series of events causes the family's world to come crashing down around them with drastic consequences for all.  While much of the story rang true, especially the parts about trying to carry on a normal life while your world is in chaos;  many things in this novel just did not add up for me.  Given the highly irrational and destructive behavior of their daughter the author must be saying one of two things:  you can do everything right with your child and they can end up with severe mental illness (ie schizophrenia),or this child is seriously troubled for some tangible reason.  The problem with this story is you never know which direction the author is trying to steer you.  There is nothing in the plot to lead you to believe that these were less than stellar parents, yet their seemingly normal daughter turns in to a near sociopath over night, what gives?  I would have preferred more insight into Rachel's highly dysfunctional relationship with her own obviously disturbed mother, as well as a clearer rationale for Kate's behavior.  3.5 stars.	2003-11-30

What if two twentysomething girls from England headed to India for a little fun and enlightenment?  What if the trip that should have been little more than a memorable adventure turned into the holiday from hell with tragic consequences?  The author does several things right with this novel.  Her descriptions of the stress, fear and difficulty associated with travel in a third world country are frighteningly accurate. Travelling \\"on the cheap\\" can be anything but glamorous, and the author's descriptions of the sights, smells and sounds of the place put you right there with the characters.  The characters however are where some of my difficulties with this novel begin.  Neither Esther, our beautiful, impetuous narrator, or Gemma her chubby, bookish  friend are well developed enough to garner much sympathy from the reader.  With out giving anything away I found some of their actions,(especially Gemma's decision to ignore an impending disaster), totally unbeleivable, and given the outcome, almost sociopathic.  The horrific event which is crucial to the plot, is treated in such an offhand and dismissive way by the author and her characters as to be offensive to the reader.  As other readers have noted, I saw the ending coming a mile away, even though much of the suspense leading up to it was well done.  Overall not a bad book, but one that could have been so much better. 3.5 stars.	2003-11-29

This is a small, sensible, gem of a book on the often overwhelming and thankless task of being a wife and mother. No, it's not a feminist rant, just a realistic look at what it means to sacrifice yourself for others.  This book would make the perfect gift for every mother with young children...trust me.	2003-11-27

A compulsive liar with a drinking problem, she has a husband that seems to have something to hide, parents who have separated, and a close friend whose recent and suspicious death was bizarre to say the least. Dair's life is definately spiraling out of control, and her lifetime of lying is starting to take it's toll.<br />This is a well written page turner with just enough twists to keep the reader guessing.  My only criticism would be that I found the &quot;animal telepathy&quot; angle a little difficult to swallow.  Even an animal lover such as myself grew tired of the endless references to the character's pets.  That said, this is still a enjoyable, albeit unusual mystery novel worth reading.	2003-11-13

I'm afraid not	I know I'm venturing out into unpopular territory by giving this novel less than a five star rating  I will however risk the negative votes by being honest with my review.  This seems to be one of those stories that elicits a strong emotional response in it's readers; and while I found the story enjoyable and often compelling, something was lacking for me in the character of Peekay.  Oh, I felt for him during the trials and tribulations of his childhood, but for me something just didn't ring true.  Everything about Peekay seemed just a notch over the top, just a little too much to be genuine.  Brilliant, athletically gifted, loved by young and old, black and white, never at a loss for the right thing to say and do in any circumstance, the list goes on and on.  There is nothing wrong with \\"idealistic\\" characters, but Peekay often struck me with a certain smugness that I found unappealing.  I still think this is a story worth reading, but as far as idealized characters go, I had a much easier time with say \\"Owen Meany\\" than I did with Peekay.	2003-11-07

This return foray into his work was for the most part enjoyable.  This is a solid little novel that keeps you interested and guessing throughout.  I was also impressed with Straub's ability to get into the head of a teenage boy, I thought it was remarkably well done.  My only criticism would be of the ending. I like some other reveiwers found it a bit weak, and rather out of left field.  Overall, if a well written mystery/ghost/love story is your thing, I believe you will enjoy this one.	2003-10-30

This story delivers the goods; its well written, has true-to-life characters, and best of all, it's actually scary.  The book almost reads like three novellas, with the common theme being the very creepy house itself. I guarantee that if you are a fan of the haunted house story you will not be disappointed.  You may however think twice about that old home renovation.  Light on gore and heavy on story, this novel deserves all the praise the reviewers are giving it.	2003-10-22

To say Lou Ann's family is dysfunctional is an understatement; Daddy has a roving eye and Mama's laundry list of neuroses would fill the page.  To cope with this intolerable home life, Lou Ann creates an imaginary world with \\"The Box Children\\", the unborn babies from her mother's many failed pregnancies.  This novel speaks to the resiliant spirit of children from dysfunctional homes, and offers a somewhat hopeful future for our heroine.  If you read this book you will think as I do, that Lou Ann was able to triumph over adversity and make her way in the world.  4.5 stars	2003-09-24

The subject matter is brutal (a violent rape),and her family rife with dysfunction (Dad is distant and cold, Mom is constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and Sis is overachieving and lonley).  Alice is the glue that binds this fragile family together, and her rape and it's aftermath brings out the best and worst in those around her.  This is a well written, page turner of a book that I would recommend highly.  If you enjoyed Alice Sebold's novel \\"The Lovely Bones\\", I can guarantee you will not be disappointed with this effort.	2003-09-18

It has it's moments but overall there are far better efforts out there.  &quot;Sloppy Firsts&quot; is wittier and much funnier, albeit it is written from a female perspective.  This one tends to ramble on too much, although it did provide numerous obscure late &quot;70's&quot; references that unless you were a teenager in those years would pass right by (ie, how many people remember the lyrics to the Dan Hill song, &quot;Sometimes when we touch?&quot;).  Overall not a bad quick summer read, but you will have to look elsewhere for more substance.	2003-08-15

Not an abduction or an accident, they are as the novel simply states, \\"Poof\\", gone into thin air.  This is the unliklely premise that the author successfully pulls off in this dreamlike, but realistically gripping novel.  Five year old James accompanies his family to the circus; a birthday treat for his seven year old sister.  James is withdrawn and developmentally slow, an issue that is weighing heavily on the minds of his parents.  Much to their surprize their shy son eagerly volunteers to assist the clown with his stage routine;  the finale of that act resulting in the disappearance of James much to the delight of the audience.  However when James cannot be located after the show and a security tape is viewed, the world of his family comes crashing down around them.  How James' strange disappearance effects his family and those connected to their lives (the clown from the circus and the police officer sent to assist them), is both gut-wrenching and uplifting.  While the premise is unlikely the author pulls it off through flashbacks and \\"what if's\\".  A thoroughly enjoyable story with much to ponder.	2003-08-13

The first two were fun, fast reads; somewhat predictable but likeable none the less.  I'm afraid to say that I did not enjoy this installment nearly as much as the others.  Becky seems to be somewhat cured of her out of control spending, unfortunatly she also seems to have become a spineless simpering girl unable to make any type of decision.  The plot ends up becoming tiresome, and Becky's schtick is definately wearing thin. I think the series has run out of steam, but something tells me &quot;A Shopaholic Gets Preggers&quot; can't be far behind.  2.5 Stars.	2003-07-24

There are so many social commentaries going on here its hard to know where to begin.  The central theme of course is the suicides of the five beautiful, remote Lisbon sisters.  The why of their deaths is not really relevant to the storyline, in fact a satisfying answer is never obtained.  The novel is more a reflection on the alienation and angst of those teenage years.  The unrequited longing that teenagers feel for one another, the need to rebel, the need to conform, the desperate urgency that permeates every emotion.  The narrator's observations and &quot;investigation&quot; of the deaths takes on an almost creepy voyueristic tone, yet still maintains an almost childlike innocence.  This novel is well worth your time to read, just be prepared to be a bit &quot;creeped out&quot; now and then.	2003-07-15

Mirabelle is an oddly unsettling character, an aloof, introspective, artist adrift in a world of siliconed Beverly Hills blondes.  Her appeal to men is quietly unnerving, they are drawn to her without ever really understanding why.<br />I am often not a fan of the novella simply because they rarely contain enough character or plot development for my tastes.  Shopgirl, while entertaining did leave me pondering a whole lot of loose ends.  Mirabelle is certainly suffering from fairly severe clinical depression, yet this illness is treated in an almost superficial way.  We learn that Mirabelle's father is harboring some unresolved Vietnam war secrets, but nothing more is ever learned.  Ray Porter, Mirabelle's wealthy, older lover has a whole heap of unexplored neurosis just waiting to be uncovered.<br />So, if you are looking for an interesting quick read, Shopgirl fits the bill. Just remember this is a novella, and if you like all your questions to be answered you may find yourself disappointed.	2003-07-06

I will certainly pick up the sequel, Second Helpings based on the smile this one brought to my face.	2003-06-28

The interwoven lives and stories of two WW2 era comic book writing Jewish cousins takes us on a roller-coaster ride through Europe, NYC, and even Antarctica.  Highly implausible events and scenarios are written in such a way that not only do they make sense, you can't imagine the storyline any other way; surely a sign of superb writing and a clever plot.  My only negative comment would be that I felt the novel dragged a bit in places and perhaps could have benefitted from a more judicious edit.  That aside C & K is still well worth your time to read. 4.5 stars	2003-06-27

I think therein lies part of the problem; the author spends so much time bombarding us with the details of parapsychology and psychic research that the story itself seems to get lost in the shuffle.  While the book is well written and full of evocative language, the thrill element of a good haunted house story is sorely lacking.  What's the point of ghosts if not to give a scare or two?  Try &quot;The Woman in Black&quot; by Susan Hill for a far better haunted house story.	2003-06-01

I approached her second novel with both excitement and trepidation.  Could her sophomore effort live up to the near perfection of her first book?<br />This is the story of Lily, a twentysomething Londoner who beleives she may have just met the man of her dreams; a handsome, successful architect named Marcus.  Lily learns that Marcus' relationship with an ex-girlfriend named Sinead has recently ended under tragic circumstances.  Marcus' veiled comments about Sinead lead Lily to believe she has died, but has she?  Lily begins to obsess about what happened to Sinead; when she starts to see her image on the street and in her dreams the lines between reality and fantasy become blurred.  The truth of what happened between Marcus and Sinead makes for some gut-wrenching reading.  Maggie O'Farrell once again shows her prowess with the pen, creating characters we feel we know intimately.  This fascinating look at relationships past and present, and how the two are often intermingled is well worth your time to read.  Did I love this novel as much as her first?....no, but that would be asking for a near impossibility.  4.5 stars.	2003-05-25

Strange Fits of Passion is a well written page turner that delves into the terrifying realm of spousal abuse.  The era is the late sixties and early seventies, and while domestic abuse is certainly prevalent it is rarely discussed and often quietly accepted.<br />Maureen English would appear to be leading the perfect life; an outwardly happy marraige to a successful journalist and a lovely new baby daughter.  Behind closed doors however life for Maureen is anything but blissful.  Her hard drinking husband is subjecting her to regular doses of physical and sexual violence.  Terrified for the safety of herself and child, Maureen flees in the night to the relative anonimity of a small New England town.  Maureen changes her name and begins to attempt to pick up the pieces of her shattered life.  The facade quickly crumbles when Maureen's husband locates her and attempts to force her to come home.  While very disturbing to read at times, this novel also shows us how far we have come in understanding domestic violence and it's effect on it's victims.  Women who were subject to this brutality had few resources and even fewer options for help.  Remember, in the era the story occurs, a man could not even techinically be charged with raping his wife in the State of Maine. While domestic violence is still prevalent, one would hope in today's era a woman would fare far better than Maureen ultimately did.	2003-05-21

This is the story of Addy Shadd, an elderly Black woman with plenty of heartbreaking secrets in her past.  Addy comes to \\"inherit\\" five year old Sharla Cody, a mixed race child with no father and a less than caring mother. The fascinating story of Addy's life is carefully weaved into her present relationship with Sharla, it makes for a story you won't want to put down.  My only minor negative comment would be that at times the volume of tragedy in Addy's life seems overwhelming even for the reader. That aside, I would highly recommend seeking out this novel. 4.5 stars.	2003-05-09

Maggie O'Farrell's first novel, &quot;After You'd Gone&quot; is one of my all time favorite books, and I realized that it would be impossible not to make the inevitable comparisons.  Like her previous work, this is a story about relationships, love, grief and the unknown.  Ms O'Farrell has the enviable ability to interweave story lines in subtle and unique ways, &quot;My Lover's Lover&quot; is no exception.<br />Lily meets Marcus at a party and he would seem to be the perfect man.  A handsome, articulate architect, this man would seem to have no flaws.  But things are not as they appear, and the mystery of what happened to Marcus' ex-girfriend Sinead begins to inflitrate their relationship. The lines between reality and imagination are very blurry in this novel, and it takes careful attention to the story to avoid some level of frustration.  Overall this is an unusual and compelling read, that had me both confused and delighted.  I can't say it ranks quite as high as &quot;After you'd gone&quot;, but for fans of Maggie O'Farrell, a must read none the less.	2003-03-28

My only criticism (if you could call it that), was that I was fascinated by the character of Clay's mother, Anneth, and would have loved to know more about her turbulent life.

Okay, I know this is a &quot;fun&quot; book, the humour is tongue-in-cheek and over the top, and I indeed did laugh out loud in several places. However, I often felt that I  was  reading through a psychaitrist's case study, I mean this girl is in need of some serious intervention.  When I read &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot;, I thought Becky was in need of some professional help then, now the poor thing seems downright certifiable. While Becky's antics are fun to read about, they must be done in conjunction with a total dispensation of belief.  A life lived like hers would be anything but funny!  That said, this is a very quick, cute little book that you can polish off in a couple hours.  I know the next in the series pertains to Becky's marraige, I can only imagine &quot;A Shopaholic Does Therapy&quot; can't be far behind.	2003-03-15

He's handsome and popular, but also angst ridden, bored, and sexually frustrated.  But Kevin's life is different from that of his friends; not only is he struggling with the realization that his mother's death may have been self-inflicted (due to her knowledge of his father's affair),but Kevin is gay and that is complicating matters even more.  He lusts after a class-mate only to discover that the feeling is not mutual. To compensate for his growing sense of paranoia of being discovered, Kevin falls into a relationship with a girl, with less than stellar results.  Kevin's growing frustration with how to express his sexuality makes for some angry outbursts and hilarious dialogue.  This well written novel is poignant, funny and filled with memorable characters.  The author has the feel of the era just right; my own high school years came easily back to memory.  This novel confirms that gay or straight, popular or not, the adolescence experience is in so many ways universal for all.  Highly recommended.	2003-02-27

Amy Priestly and her widowed father Oswald are headed toward a collision course with unnamed horrors, all of which reside in their home of Nazarill.  I admit that it took me awhile to get into this novel, the style of writing is often difficult, especially the cadence of Oswald which only grows more archaic as the story progresses.  The final few chapters are superb, with the level of tension building to an almost unbearable climax. If you are looking for a well written horror story that delivers, this one does the genre proud.	2003-02-17

This is old-fashioned ghost story telling at its best; short, simple and superbly told.  Best of all it delivers the goods, a shiver, a jump and a fright that lingers.

I truly think most of the humour in this book is meant to be tongue-in-cheek, it's just too over the top to be taken so seriously.  Whether you have been a full/part time working mom, or a stay-at-home one, who of us has not felt guilt about whether we were being the best mother to our children.  Maternal angst goes with the job of motherhood.  The anger directed toward this book seems to be focused on the fact that \\"Kate\\" didn't have to work, had nannys and cleaning women and was still struggling. As mother's we all have different stories, and while certainly not the most common scenario, this is just one of many.  Good mothers come in all manner of packages, as do bad (remember Jack's comment about his stay-at-home mom that played bridge and drank martini's all day?)  This book is a quick, funny and poignant read.  No, it's certainly not indicative of most women's motherhood experience, but remember.... it's fiction!	2003-01-30

I have the utmost respect for Matheson as a horror writer, but for me Hell House has one very fundamental flaw... it's not scary.  The writing is atmospheric, moody, occasionally even shocking, but.... it's not scary. The only character I even felt remotely sympathetic towards was the psychic Florence, as for the rest.. lets say I was often rooting for the house. A truly scary haunted house story needs to quicken the pulse, give a shiver, or make you jump at a strange sound, all were sadly lacking at the Belasco residence.	2003-01-26

The story of a Canadian family living with their haunted house experiences as told through the eyes of the mother had promise, but suffers a bit through the lack of a good editing.  What seems like endless repitition of the same information, along with a rather amatuerish style is somewhat distracting to the reader.  The story itself is interesting and well presented, but if your looking for a good scare this one will likely leave you disappointed.  There was one major flaw that as a reader left me truly frustrated; the author supplied some photos of what were thought to be siginificant objects related to the haunting, yet many more of these items were found and described but not photographed.  There was also additional &quot;phenomenon&quot; such as handprints that appeared several times but were not photographed.  It seems very odd that the author would photograph some of these items and events and not bother with others.	2003-01-23

Twilight Zone, Night Gallery, and the \\"movie of the week\\" were my childhood thrills.  Like many others I have never forgotten the vision of Karen Black being chased around by a possessed Zuni doll, in Trilogy of Terror.  I now know where that story comes from (The Prey), along with several other thrillers from years past.  This is a solid collection, yes there are a few clunkers, but overall the stories are excellent.  My personal favorite was \\"Disappearing Act\\", a truly unnerving reading experience.  This collection has stood the test of time for good reason.  4.5 stars.	2003-01-23

In fact it's so enjoyable I cannot think of a single negative comment to say about it.  The author has got the art of storytelling honed down to a fine art in this novel.  Some books are full of great language, great imagery, or great characters.  This one reads like a long bedtime story being read to you by a parent; you don't want the teller to stop and you sure don't want to go to sleep till it's finished.  Highly recommended, a real treasure.	2003-01-09

The \\"novelty\\" of not knowing the gender of the narrator never really did it for me, (perhaps as I had convinced myself of the sex of the narrator fairly early on).  But as the story progressed I became more and more involved, not so much with any of the secondary characters including our narrator's love interest, but with the narrator him/herself.  The depth and pain associated with their love was palpable and very real.  I'm not quite sure whether I actually enjoyed this book, but I'm still thinking about it, and that in and of itself says something.	2003-01-03

For me this book was all about longing, longing for love (lost and current), longing for identity and self, and longing for solace.  Each of the three characters brings to the story similar and unique perspectives on these needs.  Although I felt for the characters (especially Virginia Woolf), there is a strong sense of aloofness and detachment with these individuals.  We are never fully allowed into their worlds, (especially with Mrs Brown) and we are given only minimal insight into the motivations for their actions.  This distance can leave the reader feeling somewhat unsatisfied (Why are these people doing what they're doing?).  But I think that's the point, it's up to the reader to make up their own mind as to what is going on here.  &quot;The Hours&quot; is thoughtful, pensive and open to a variety of interpretations.  A quick read but certainly not a &quot;light&quot; one.	2002-12-06

It was certainly funny, poignant, and sharply witty.  I did however come away with a fairly pervasive sense of underlying sadness.  While I believe the author's childhood to be basically a happy one, there were certainly some elements of major dysfunction going on in this family (she devotes an entire section to the things her father has won and lost through gambling).  It would also appear that her mother suffered from rather chronic depression (she spends most of the book on the couch reading).  That being said it was obvious that the author was well loved by her family, and it's a pleasant change to read a memoir about childhood that isn't filled with pain and abuse.	2002-12-02

I confess it brought a tear to my eye more than once so the author must have gotten some things right.  I would have prefered a more in-depth look at the friendship between Ann and Ruth, I often felt that the author was just scratching the surface.  The cast of &quot;supporting&quot; friends almost seemed unnecessary to the storyline, they just didn't add much and often seemed like an afterthought.  That said I did enjoy this book, but because of it's brevity I can only give it 4 stars.	2002-12-02

Our main character Pi tells our writer that he has a story that will make him believe in God.  A tall order, as Pi is a practicing Catholic, Muslim, and Hindu.  The story Pi tells is an amazing one.  Now at first the idea of a teenage boy shipwrecked on a life boat with a tiger, a hyena, a orangutan and a zebra seems almost ridiculous to say the least, but trust me, it's anything but.  I read this book in one sitting, it had me that hooked.<br />The feel of this book is almost indescribable, yes it's surreal but by stripping down life to its' most basic elements (survival, strength, weakness, compassion, cruelty, resourcefulness and faith), it makes painfully clear how fragile our existance truly is.  I can't predict what you will believe after it's over, I know however you will be thinking about it for some time.  You will just have to read this one for yourself, now.	2002-11-29

I miss these characters (especially Sugar and Sophie), and even after close to 900 pages I was not ready to give this book up.  My only hope is that perhaps a sequel is in the works.  I love a book that I can get lost in, somthing that transports me to another time and place, this is one of those books at it's finest.  Yes, it's a bit raunchy at times (but always appropriatly so), after all prostitution is central to the plot.  If your'e prepared to give up all you free time for a bit (you will want to do nothing but read), then you've found your match.	2002-11-29

I wish I could say the same thing for &quot;Blessings&quot;, I just could not get past the incrediably unlikely premise that this story is based on. We have Skip, a twentysomething single guy, down on his luck, and needing a break after taking the fall for a robbery attempt and spending some time in jail.  He goes to work for Lydia Blessing an elderly, wealthy, widow with more than her share of personal and family secrets.  Now enter baby &quot;Faith&quot;. Skip finds a newborn foundling left on his doorstep (he lives over the garage at Lydia's estate), and what does our petty criminal with a heart of gold decide; I'll keep this baby as my own, yes, that won't cause any concerns with my parole officer.  Honestly what do you think the chances of a 20 year old guy with a whole heap of issues, taking on the dauting responsibilities of caring for a newborn not his own are?  After I suspended all disbelief, I began to think, well it is possible.  Then I remembered what a newborn is all about and thought no way, no how.  In any event, the story moves on with Lydia finding out about the baby and the two forming an odd friendship based on their growing and mutual adoration of the infant.  There was likely no way to end this story &quot;happily&quot;, but this ending felt rushed and forced to me, not at all satisfying.  I actually found the side story about Lydia Blessings early life, her secrets and family far more interesting than the Skip and the baby route.  The author could easily have written a far more compelling novel, by focusing just on this storyline.  As it stands this one comes off about as bland as baby formula.	2002-11-14

She was offered ECT as a procedure of last resort, as all other forms of treatment had been unsucessful to date. She declined ECT, and three weeks ago took her life. This \\"diary\\" holds great interest for me, as I am very curious about the author's decision to go forward with ECT. For her, the treatment was successful, and now I can't help but wonder if it would have had the same result for my friend.<br />I enjoyed reading this book very much, it's funny, touching and gives real insight into the pain and desperation that is felt by those suffering from severe depression. Like the author my friend was also highly educated, and high functioning for a great deal of the time. I would recommend this book for anyone dealing with depression, and for anyone wanting to gain a better understanding of this misunderstood illness.	2002-11-06

Perhaps that is a good thing, as I approached the &quot;The Little Friend&quot; with no pre-conceived notions about Ms Tartt's ability to write.  I am left with no doubt about her ability to write, and write and write and therein lies part of the problem.  This book could easily have been trimmed by a couple of hundred pages, and likely been far better for it.  I have no problem with detail, but copious quantities of it that seem to have no purpose other than to fill the page... well that just seems like a lot of filler to me.   Another reviewer said this book kept putting them to sleep, and I confess I had the same reaction, usually I'm good for hours of steady reading, with this one 20 minutes and my eyelids were drooping, not a good sign.  When a book is over 500 pages in length it better be able to hold my attention, this one did not.  I never cared for any of the characters, even Harriet our protagonist got on my nerves.  So readers, I'm with the consensus on this one, not a stellar work on any level.	2002-11-06

My 5 year old's entire Kindergarten class has wanted to hear this story over and over.

I think only those who have been in the depths of such despair (as the author of this important book has),can fully comprehend that type of pain. My best friend suffered for years with severe, chronic depression, and recently took her life.  This book was recommended to me as a place to begin to understand the enormity of a suicide, and to help me deal with the profound and gut-wrenching pain that has followed.  I have found this book to be very helpful, especially the final chapter, &quot;A half-stitched scar, those left behind&quot;.  If a suicide has ever touched your life I would highly recommend seeking out this book to begin the healing process.	2002-11-01

Another reviewer has likened this work to that of John Irving, and I would have to agree.  Like Irving, Eugenides introduces us to an offbeat and unusual cast of characters, the main being Cal/Callie a Greek/American hermaphrodite being raised as a girl in a hilarious, lovable, ethnic family.  This novel is rich with detail, history and research, it's easy to get lost in this big, meaty book.  I especially loved the scenes where the young Callie heads out alone to find her father during the Detroit race riots, hilarious and touching.  The characters are wonderful, beginning with Cal's grandparents (whose marital secret sets the stage for Cal's turmoil), believe me, you've never met another family quite like this one.  Cal will go down in my list of unforgettable characters, you truly care about her/him and will miss him when the book ends.  Don't let the unusual subject matter turn you off, this is a book worth reading.	2002-10-30

Was it a ghost story, an examination of a marraige, or the journal of one man's near descent into madness?  I conclude it's all of these things, but I must say I found it rather lacking in the scare department.  The main reason I choose a ghost story is for a few good frights, and I can't say I had any here.  If a book purports to be a ghost story, then give me a chill here and there.  Yes, this one had ghosts but they didn't do much other than occasionally beat up the narrator, and be generally annoying.  I did find the cover art very intriguing and looked at the face often while reading, in fact I found that image far more frightening than the story.  So overall not bad, but certainly not a stellar ghost story.  For a much better thrill that is equally well written try &quot;Ghosts&quot; by Noel Hynd.	2002-10-10
US	44761874	RQ81DDSKJQ2H0	0374525188	315724223	Housekeeping: A Novel	Books	4	9	9	N	N	This one will get you thinking	Upfront let me state that I think \\"Housekeeping\\" is a book worth reading. The writing is lyrical, profound and often awe-inspiring. This is the story of two sisters, Ruth and Lucille. The death of their mother has forced them to live with a series of relatives, each of whom has moved into the family home. The final relative to arrive on the scene is their Aunt Sylvie, a non-conforming drifter whose eccentricities make her suitability as a mother figure questionable at best. She collects garbage in the living room, rarely cooks or cleans, doesn't care whether the girl's attend school, and likes to ride the rails.  Lucille yearns for a \\"normal\\" life and eventually rebels against and leaves this unconventional household.  Ruth seems to lose herself and her pain in this strange lifestyle, and becomes Sylvie's soulmate. This novel is a complex examination of what constitues a \\"normal\\" homelife, and how our society places much credence on outward appearances, often caring little for what goes on behind closed doors until it may be too late. While I believe Sylvie was a caring figure, I also believe she was not the best choice to raise these children, and ultimately they paid the price for that. This is not a happy story with a tidy ending, so if you like your fiction that way this is likely not the book for you. However, if you are willing to think beyond the box for a few hours you will be rewarded with a rich reading experience.	2002-10-05

I am always intrigued by novels that have reviews ranging from \\"this is the best book I've ever read to this is the worst thing ever\\".  I would place this book somewhere firmly in the middle, certainly not the worst I've read, and most assuredly not the best.  The premise is certainly fascinating, when we meet our narrator Susie she is talking to us from heaven after her murder.  Susie looks down on her family's ordeal after her murder, and follows the life of her killer as well.  I did have some problems with the lack of emotion displayed by Susie.  I know she's dead and perhaps that's what happens but dead or alive a narrator needs some feeling,and Susie sure didn't have much.  Case in point,about the worst thing she can say about her murderer is \\"that man has no shame\\".  One would expect a slightly more emotional response when discussing one's killer you would think.  Like many other reviewers I did give a groan when Susie inhabits the body of her friend for a romp with her old love (yikes!)  So overall not a bad book, I think it could have been better but worth a read if the premise interests you.	2002-09-30

I truly wanted to like this novel,(as it was a selection by my bookclub), alas I did not.  My reasons for disliking it are simple; it is terribly dull. I kept waiting for something to happen (it never does).  The characters are one dimentional at best, and our muse Griet would appear to be the most amazing and accomplished teenager to have ever lived.  At the tender age of 16 she knows everything about running a large household, raising children, manipulating the mature women of the house, fending off the advances of men, and in case that wasn't enough she's giving art tips to the master himself, um sure... that's plausible.  While the premise of this book was fascinating the execution certainly was not.  The best thing about this novel?... the cover art!!	2002-09-25

It's not that I didn't enjoy it, the writing is witty and I had a few good laughs while reading.  I can also state that the Mrs X's of the world don't just live in Manhattan, they are everywhere.  Perhaps it's that as a Mom I felt such disgust over the treatment of Grayer by his uber rich parents that I could hardly keep reading at times.  The Nanny Diaries is a quick and easy read, that while perhaps being a guilty pleasure read for some, made me want to go and give my son a big hug.	2002-09-14

The story of a family dealing with their young daughter's disfiguring and fatal illness is touching and realistic.  Told from the father's perspective we come to realize that all parents experience many of the same joys, heartaches, and frustrations, whether their children are healthy or terminally ill.  A quiet, thoughtful book that I will remember fondly.	2002-09-04

It's not that this is a bad book, in fact I enjoyed it in parts quite a bit. It's just that when Diana finds herself in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, things began to take a turn for the &quot;unreal&quot;.  She meets up with a group of people after an unusual event and within moments these total strangers are treating her like their long lost best friend.  Now I know Diana is grief-stricken and still in a state of shock, and it may be that the residents of this part of New Jersey are the friendliest people in the world, but this whole idea seemed so unlikely and contrived that I could not get past it.  While some reviewers had difficulty with the character of Diana, I was more put off by Louisa.  Yes, we kept being told how beautiful she was, but other than that I could not for the life of me understand why anyone would want to have anything to do with her.  Overall this is a quick read that touches on some important issues about grief and healing, but it's certainly not a story that will stay with me.	2002-08-30

I could not agree with you more, what a fantastic book to get the imagination churning.  I went through this book with my five year old, he took a turn making up a story and then I would take a turn.  Believe me some of his stories were better than mine, and he has not yet become bored with this book as he does with so many others.  So turn off the TV and sit down with a child to make up some stories!  My only caveat would be that I would not recommend this book for the very young or those children who are easily spooked, as some of the imagery is a little on the creepy side.	2002-08-28

It takes a lot for me to give up on a book, and I came close with this one several times.  It just did not seem to hold my attention, I found my mind wandering off mid-page, not the desired result in a whodunnit.  The book starts off promising enough; police chief investigating the murder of a mentally handicapped girl begins to suspect that his own son is involved.  We then flash forward to the former chief's daughter, now also a cop who begins to reinvestigate the old unsolved case.  So just what were my problems with this novel?  Firstly this story contains some of the most unintentionally hilarious dialogue that I have ever read (don't buy it?, try reading page 105 without snickering!) There are all kinds of sub-plots that don't go anywhere and have nothing to do with the mystery, the characters seemed shallow and wooden... Oh I could go on, suffice to say this one just wasn't for me, there are far better whodunnit's out there.	2002-08-22

It's still a fun read, that had me laughing out loud and genuinely touched, especially when Cannie shared her pain about her father.  It's hard not to like Cannie, she's witty, smart and has some great one-liners.  Yes she's struggling with her weight, but don't all North American women, fat, thin or average struggle with some body image issues at some time?  There is plenty to relate to here, in our quest to be &quot;body perfect&quot;.  I liked this book and I liked Cannie, what more needs to be said!	2002-08-20

Calvin and his family spend a part of each summer in lovely Portofino,Italy.  Calvin's parents are strict Prodestant fundamental missionaries who are desparate to convert the &quot;heathen Catholics&quot; around them.  Calvin's two sister's are equally zealous, but Calvin is not so sure.  He is constantly embarrassed by his mother's non-stop praying, his father's temper and the agonies of adolescence.  On another level however there are many obvious jabs at fundamentalists, and as I understand the author was in fact raised by missionary parents there are some very unflattering references drawn with respect to his father.  That said this is still a super little read that is both poignant and hilarious.  It's worth your time to seek this one out.	2002-08-12

While this is not a \\"whodunnit\\" (and those of you looking for one will be disappointed), a murder does figure prominently in the storyline.  Our story takes place in 1972 with 10 year old Marsha narrating.  Her father has run off with her Aunt, her mother is at her wits end, her twin siblings are getting into trouble, and a neighborhood boy has been murdered.  I could especially relate to the time and feel of this story as I too was a ten year old girl in 1972.  I remember just as in the novel when everyone knew their neighbors and no one locked their doors.  But times are changing and the murder signals an end of innocence in Marsha's life and the world around her.  This is a well written story with an extremely realistic feel; I could picture this neighborhood so clearly in my head it was as if I had actually been there.  Seek this novel out, it's well worth your time to read.	2002-08-07

Molly, Gary, Suzanne and Baby Otis were people I actually was concerned for, and needed to know what the outcomes in their lives were.  This is a touching story that is not as sickly sweet as you may think, these people are far from perfect and certainly possess as many weaknesses as strenghts.  I had a few minor problems with this novel (there were some glaring typos for example), and some of the big issue problems like the financial crisis seemed to be forgotten by the end of the novel, but these are again minor and in no way affect the overall worthiness of the story. It is easy to lose yourself in the lives of these characters for a few hours, it would make for a fine summer read.	2002-08-03

While I am not typically a fan of the \\"gothic\\" novel, I have wanted to read this modern classic for years to see if it would live up to the hype. I was pleasantly surprized to find that \\"Rebecca\\" is indeed worthy of the praise it has received over the years. I won't re-hash the plot, (naive young woman marries widower, goes to live at his creepy estate where the memory of his former wife Rebecca is everywhere). Suffice to say this novel has great suspense, a superb sense of foreboding, and enough plot twists to keep you hooked. As other reviewers have stated, it was a particularly brilliant detail to keep our heroine unnamed, it allowed the lingering memory of Rebecca to pervade this novel just as she infiltrated each of it's characters. Rebecca does not disappoint, highly recommended.	2002-07-31

This is not your typical \\"dysfunctional family\\" fare although you might think that by reading the book jacket..... young girl and her siblings are orphaned when parents are killled in a car accident. Yes that does set the stage for this book, but the story itself is not limited to a melodramatic interpretation of the outcomes of that event. The author flawlessly weaves the narration of the main character Kate between the past and present, it's as skilled and understated a portrayal as I have ever read. This novel would be an excellent choice for a bookclub, I give it an unconditional recommendation.	2002-07-28

Although I know I was supposed to feel great empathy for the main characters, I never got there.  Much of the character development was woefully lacking, and the vast jumps in time (practically just pages between the childhood and adulthood of Sophie for example), did not make getting to know these people any easier.  This novel needed to be considerably longer, with much more detail as to the motivations for the characters actions.  The ending felt hurried to me; a plethora of social ills dumped again into a few short pages.  All this said, I believe the author does possess talent and as I understand this is her first novel perhaps that skill will emerge more clearly as she matures as a writer.	2002-07-24

Our main character Alice while intellegent and lovely, is so easily swayed by the men in her life I was beginning to think she was incapable of knowing her own mind.

Greenwood as an author. \\"Breathing Water\\" and \\"Nearer than the Sky\\" are two truly remarkable novels.  This novel too held much promise, but upon completion I came away feeling rather unsatisfied.  The world of Piper Kincaid is not a happy one.  A thrity year old woman dying of breast cancer, she begins to reflect upon the traumatic events of her adolescence.  Her seemingly loving mother abandons the family, forcing Piper and her brother to fend for themselves while their disinterested father persues his \\"life\\" elsewhere.  Seeking affection and approval, Piper reaches out to a teacher with disastarous results.  In her dying days, Piper thoughts are full of both her mother and the teacher, sorrow and regret. While the author touches on some type of resolution for Piper, I felt another few chapters were necessary to leave the reader with a better sense of closure on Piper's inevitable death.  Ultimately, perhaps the story tells us that although life may afford us the opportunity to attempt resolution, death may not be so generous.	2002-06-08

It's the story of a large quirky Southern family as they gather together for a wedding, that and so much more.  There is so much going on in this tale that it's almost impossible to describe it in few words.  The characters are beyond unique, each one a treasure, and with names like you've never heard.  The author keeps jumping into the narrative with his running commentary which you would think would become annoying after awhile, but only adds to the charm and hilarity of the story.  This novel is so clever and imaginative that I found myself smiling all the way through.  It would be impossible to give this any less than 5 stars!	2002-06-05

Usually after finishing a novel I have no trouble knowing what to say about the book, not here.  This is a novel of contemplation, it is both lyrical, poetic and at times slow.  The story of a Japanese girl disfigured by the atomic bomb and the German/American scientist who helped create it, covers some complex philosophical issues.  Is the use of a weapon of mass distruction justifiable if it brings about a perceived greater good? (in this case the end of WW2) The opening scene of Emiko and her brother witnessing the drop of the bomb is truly haunting and brilliantly written.  While I had great sympathy for Emiko she was not a particularly empathetic character.  I felt much more warmth for Anton the scientist and his long-suffering wife Sophie.  My reason for not giving this novel 5 stars was echoed by another reviewer.  I never felt like I got to know the characters well enough or understood the motivation for many of their actions.  This especially applied to Sophie, who seemed both disillusioned and content with her lot in life.<br />There is a lot going on in this book, although it is a quick read it is by no means \\"light\\" reading.  In conclusion, a line from Anton has been staying in my thoughts, he states he is less haunted by the dropping of the bomb, and more haunted by what the world would have become if the bomb had not been dropped.  What indeed?	2002-06-03

I would give this collection a 4.5 if I could but since there are really no duds in the bunch and I am feeling generous a 5 it is!  Whether you love or hate Stephen King there is no denying that the man can write a story.  I sometimes feel he is at his best within the short story genre.  As much as I have enjoyed many of his novels over the years, I have often felt he is prone to repitition when he gets into the novel.  Nonetheless there are some wonderful stories here.  While I can't say that any of them scared me silly, I did have some favorites.  The best scare was had by \\"The Road Virus Heads North\\", the story of a yard sale purchase gone horribly wrong.  I liked \\"The Man in The Black Suit\\" for the way it preyed on our childhood fears of a \\"man in the bushes\\".  \\"Riding the bullet\\" gives us that classic hitch-hiking tale with a twist, and 1408 made me think of all the hotel rooms I've been in and what may have really occured in them.  If you are a fan of King's work, or just looking for some quality short stories on the creepy side this is the ticket.	2002-05-25

The descriptions of murder and mutilation are graphic and disturbing to say the least.  That said, this is a well written page turner that had me guessing all the way through.  We meet Detective Jack Caffrey, young, handsome, clever and tormented.  He appears to have met his match with a serial killer whose sheer brutality and perversion are almost unthinkable.  I especially liked the side story pertaining to the disappearance of Jack's brother, and how it relates to his creepy neighbor.  Jack's relationship with his girlfriend Veronica gives new meaning to the word dysfunctional!  So if you think you've got the stomach for it, by all means go ahead with Birdman, you won't be disappointed.	2002-05-22

Just let me say that I liked this novel, but did I love it?, no I'm afraid not.(if I could I would have given it a 3.5) Why? well although the writing was lovely and I am rather partial to bees and coming of age stories in general, I was far more interested in the Boatwright sisters and their lives than the life of the main character Lily.  What I really would like is a &quot;prequel&quot;.  I want to know much more about the sisters and how they came to live and work as beekeepers and black women of independent means in a time when that was rare in the South, that would have the makings of a great story!  I was also craving much more information about Lily's mother, and her life and relationship with August, along with what happened in her marraige to T. Ray.  So I guess overall I did not dislike this story, I was just far more interested the the &quot;supporting&quot; cast so to speak.	2002-05-14

I must agree with another reviewer who stated that the character of Marcus seemed remarkably placid and content considering that he had such hopeless parents, both of whom appeared incrediably self absorbed and self-centered.  Marcus finds what he is lacking in parental direction in Will, an unlikely candidate considering he is a 36 year old man who appears quite content in a life with no career, no real interests (except finding women ), and no real thoughts for his future.  The two form an odd but mutually beneficial friendship, that brings them both closer to maturity and what it takes to really be a man.  While I did not enjoy this novel as much as &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, it still makes for a fun read.	2002-04-30

None the less, I was captivated by this fascinating and compelling story of an unlikely horse and the three men that encouraged his greatness.  The writing is so evocative you'll swear you are hurtling down the backstretch along with the jockeys.  As I said I have no real interest in racing, but I even found the copious amount of detail about the lives of horses, jocks, trainers and owners far from dull.  Join in cheering for Seabiscuit, you won't be disappointed.	2002-04-24

Cadence Roth is a dwarf living in Hollywood under the shadow of a famous character she onced played.  She just wants to be an actress, but as you can imagine roles for dwarves are few and far between. Although it would be easy to feel sorry for Cadence we don't, she's just too resourceful, witty and strong for pity. Cadence's story is not always a happy one, but it is ultimately uplifting.  A highly recommended novel.	2002-04-15

I started reading this novel right after finishing another book, and my intention was to only read a few pages at that time.

This is a witty, poignant, well written look into yet another generationally dysfunctional family.  It's a wonder children ever grow up to be &quot;normal&quot; if people's lives mirror so many of the novels I've read lately(including this one). Ruby and her sisters try to make the most of their indifferent upbringing. This novel has a great deal of humor and a profound sense of sadness and loss on many levels.  If you enjoy British authors and dysfunctional (albeit humorous) family scenarios, you will enjoy this novel.  My only negative comment (if you could call it that), is that there are an awful lot of characters in this story, and you may often find yourself unable to keep track of who's related to who, who's sleeping with who, and who's fathered who's baby!	2002-04-07

As many of the readers have already stated it's written in the form of letters; the letters however are never answered, so it does read more like a diary.  Once you get used to the style, this is a funny, poignant and very touching story.  Ivy Rowe is a story teller with few equals, and a character not easily forgotten.	2002-03-30

A fantastic piece of writing, the author's got a uncanny ability to evoke emotion like few I have ever read.  If you have ever been deep in the throws of love, or had your heart broken, Ms. O'Farrell's writing will touch you deeply. This is not a happy story, but it is a superb one and ultimately redeeming on many levels.  Books this good are rare, you will not be disappointed.	2002-03-26

I am not typically a reader of short story collections, there are usually too many mediocre efforts thrown in with the odd good one.  What a pleasant surprize to find a collection of superb short stories, no duds in the bunch.  These are not happy tales, most of them are odd, unnerving and even disturbing.  Something or someone is &quot;missing&quot; in each story.  The reader is taken on a sometimes shocking, sometimes subtle ride through the secret thoughts and actions of it's characters.  My personal favorites were, I demand to know where you're taking me, Among the missing and Here's a little something to remember me by. If you are a reader of short stories (or not), you will not be disappointed with this effort.	2002-03-22

Eva's mother dies shortly after childbirth leaving Eva to be raised by her loving father and aunt.  From the moment Eva somehow escapes her crib as a newborn, we are certain that her life is not to be ordinary.  At the age of six she encounters her two &quot;companions&quot;, a woman and girl who are obviously otherwordly.  The mystery of why the companions are with Eva goes on throughout her life, are they there to help or harm?  This is a beautifully written story that is impossible to put down.  I can almost guarantee you will find it difficult to maintain a dry eye at the end of this story.	2002-03-21

To portray so many of them as all good or all bad only adds to their sterotypical nature (the \\"evil\\" moonshiner, the doctor with a heart of gold)  It was unfortunate that the character of Lizzy died off so early in the novel as she appeared to be more complex than many.  Our main character Kit is interesting and sympathtic, her mother I'm sorry to say was just plain annoying, whatever her mental handicaps.  I'm afraid to say the \\"revelation\\" of Kit's paternity was no surprise at all...don't skewer me for what seems like a lot of criticisms.  There are many wonderful aspects about this book, and I look forward to reading another novel by Donna Morressey.	2002-03-18

This is a very different take on the idea of just how far a mother would go to save her child from a certain death.  Just what would you be willing to do?  Would you \\"sell your soul\\" so to speak?  Dinah is a woman who seems to have everything going for her, everything that is except a healthy child.  During an endless hospital stay with her son she is \\"visited\\" by a ghost who claims to be the spirit of a long forgotten lover.  The ghost taunts and teases forcing Dinah to revisit her past and cast doubt on her future. The ghost makes the ultimate offer, possession of Dinah for the saving of Elijah.  This is a heart wrenching yet oddly funny tale about love, devotion, forgiveness and acceptance. It's well worth your time to read.	2002-03-13

This novel was chosen by my bookclub and the overall opinion on this one was that we all enjoyed it.  As none of us were terribly familiar with Dinah's story, I did feel compelled to read the chapters in Genesis for the original version.  It is obvious that Ms. Diamant's &quot;story&quot; is just that, a fictionalized version of what MAY have happened to Dinah.  Just because it is not biblically accurate does not mean it is not a compelling read.  We all were impressed by the sisterhood between the woman, it's not often you read about women's cycles with such positive and beautiful prose.  Kind of makes you wish for a Red Tent of one's own to hang out in for a few days each month.  Now the childbirth issue is another entirely, as someone who had a very difficult delivery it makes you realize how lucky we are to have modern medicine around if we need it during childbirth.  In conclusion if you are looking for a historically accurate interpretation of the bible, you will likely be disappointed, however if you are looking for a fascinating and and well written story you will find it here.	2002-03-07

Any novel that can captivate me for 500 pages has got to be something extra special, and this one did.  It has everything you want in a novel, great writing, superb characters, humor, sadness, joy and pain.  I loved every word.  There is really nothing more to be said, if you have not read this book you are truly missing out on something magical.	2002-02-27

It's really too bad this book is out of print as it is definately a good ghost story.  I must disagree with many of the other reviewers however, while creepy and well written I would not clasify it as &quot;terrifying&quot; and it certainly did not keep me up at night.  The story development is excellent, the characters quite believable, and the &quot;ghosts&quot;do all the right things.  I especially loved the ending, it was totally unexpected and was actually my favorite part of the story.  If you can find it, Ghosts is definately worth a read.	2002-02-18

In order to cope with her nightmarish childhood, she develops a keen sense of humour and some imaginary friends that follow her into adulthood.  Although she is successful academically and professionally, Thelma struggles with her sense of self and reality.

This matter-of-fact story about a young woman's descent into the depths of depression is nothing short of brilliant.  I watched a close friend suffer for years with the demon of clinical depression, and always wondered why someone with so much going for them would fall prey.  The answer I now know after reading this novel is that there is no answer, it just happens.  Although I believe that someone who does not suffer from depression can never fully understand what it feels like, reading The Bell Jar will likely take you as close as you can bear to come.	2002-02-12

Uh... no! and believe me I'm a gal that can appreciate a great pair of shoes as much as the next. This is the type of book you can finish in a couple hours while your lolling around. It's amusing and predicatable, not quite as funny as Bridget though. I actually began to think Rebecca's \\"holism\\" was bordering on the pathological, she really seemed to require some professional help!

The characters are wonderfully drawn, the story simple yet compelling.  We are given an intimate look into the daily lives of each member of the family.  Each character a marvelous study unto themselves.  We feel the family's pain and small joys, as they try as best they can to exist in a society that seems to be falling apart around them.  Unlike another reviewer who grew tired of the 'excessive' references to sights, sounds and smells, I was fascinated by these descriptions, even when reading about the family waking up to find their home flooded by raw sewage!  A final note, if any of you think your mother-in-law is a pain, wait until you meet Ammayya!  I would highly recommend this novel.	2002-01-31
US	44761874	R2NMIMJQ9QGSFT	0345439147	124729349	Swimming	Books	4	1	2	N	N	As In Life, Sink or Swim.	Let me start by saying that although I ultimately enjoyed this novel, for some reason I had a difficult time getting into it.  This is a fine piece of writing, and an interesting examination of sibling rivalry, family jealousy and secrets, and the often naive memories that the youngest family members can have of events.  It also shows us how easily seemingly harmless behavior can spiral out of control with life long devastating consequences.  My only criticisms are these; I sometimes felt the characters were too &quot;predictable&quot;. The eldest son Aaron was &quot;solid and sensitive&quot;, Jack, &quot;wild and searching&quot;, Suzanne, the girlfriend &quot;manipulative, and cold&quot;.  I never felt like I got to know these characters, and I didn't much care about them.  Only Lila, the youngest daughter seemed &quot;fully developed&quot; for lack of a better word.  Now in fairness to the author, perhaps these characters were purposely kept this way to correspond with Lila's childhood memories of them, as a reader however I was sometimes left wanting.  I must agree with other reviewers who have questioned the purpose of the prologue.  It introduces us to the parents of these children, and sets the location where events unfold, however once we get to the novel itself the parents become such minor and in my opinion lifeless characters, that it becomes difficult to believe that these two &quot;flat&quot; people could produce such dynamic offspring. That said, this is still a very good book and certainly worth a read.	2002-01-26

Rick Bragg has honored the memory of his family in a way I'm sure we all wish we could.<br />This poignant look at the hardscrabble life of a Southern family is both heartbreaking and hilarious.

I liked this book, however I'm usually not at a loss for what to say about a novel, and this one has me slightly stumped.  The writing is excellent, and there were many times I stopped and re-read a sentence for no reason other than it was so perfect.  It really is an examination of grief, and the various ways individuals cope(or do not cope with it.) As another reviewer stated I would have liked more insight into the mind of the son,<br />and his feelings about the disintigration of his family.  I found this novel to be less of a &quot;story&quot; per se, and more like a vignette of a time in the lives of three people.  It was satisfying but for some strange reason I can't quite put my finger on, this book did not stay with me once I finished it. Perhaps like it's subject matter the memory fades with the passage of time.	2001-12-19

On one level it is a universal tale about the everyday horrors of being an adolescent girl. Popularity, looks, brains or the lack there of, and all the small cruelties that girls inflict on each other are examined in a way so raw and truthful, that it's hard not to remember the agony of being a fourteen year old girl. On another level is is the disturbing story of Kate, a manipulative girl who<br />seems to be living a charmed life. We meet her charismatic minister father, her bitter grandmother and learn that her mother is strangely absent. But things are not what they appear, Kate's home is oppressive and something truly horrific is taking place behind closed doors.  It is especially interesting that the author leaves it up to the imagination of the reader to determine just what those horrors may be. In her desire to rid herself of some of her father's relentless demands, Kate enlists her girlfriend who is oblivious to her real motivation. This book will really get under your skin, it's well worth reading.	2001-12-06

However as the other reviewers have stated this book is ripe with painful almost unbearable material, and the sheer difficulty of slogging through the misfortunes of the Henderson family makes for some mighty depressing reading.  You will likely find yourself saying &quot;Enough already, how much more can these poor people take!&quot;  That said this is still an excellent book, and well worth your time to read.  Just remember if you are looking for a &quot;feelgood&quot; read this is probably not the book for you.	2001-12-05

The writing is very clear and straightforward, and the plot certainly held my attention.  There were many interesting analogies drawn in this novel.  The character of Margaret was both villan and victim, just as Tess was, the reader is both drawn and repelled by her at the same time.  A compelling look at small town life, &quot;traditional&quot; family values, and the harboring of secrets.	2001-12-03

I was pleasantly surprised with the various plot twists, they were both plausible and unexpected.  This book operates on a fear everyone has had at one time or another. Someone we love is not where we expect them to be, and our imaginations begin to get the better of us.  The story of Anna and what may or may not have happened to her during an impromptu trip to Italy, will keep you reading and interested till the last page.	2001-11-30

This is not what I would call a stellar &quot;ghost story&quot; but it is interesting and well written.  I must echo other reviewers who were left rather unsatisfied overall.  Even though I re-read several parts of the book, I still could not gain clarification on why the ghost chose to haunt Hannah and Connery. Perhaps ghosts are not really all that concerned with their motivation for haunting, however the author never really delivers the goods as to why Hannah was the intended victim.  Considering the phantom follows her around from place to place there must be a reason.  The dual plot line is well done, and very similar to &quot;The Weight of Water&quot; by Anita Shreve (I do think Ms Shreve was more effective overall with her effort however.)	2001-11-30

Things Unspoken is storytelling at it's best, simple and beautifully written.  The story of three motherless children left to essentially fend for themselves while their physician father pursues his career and his 'things unspoken&quot;, is both heartbreaking and uplifting.  Set in the 1950's and 60's, Jorie and her brothers experience a strange life, removed of friends and family, their closest mother figure an alcoholic housekeeper who eventually like the others must be sent away.  Desperate for the approval and affection of their distant (and in today's perspective), negligent father, each child must find their own way to deal with the hand they have been dealt.  This novel could have been weepy and melodramatic, but it is neither.  The author does not pursue the &quot;dysfunction of the week&quot; route, she tells us the story and allows the reader to watch what unfolds.  This is a superb novel.  There is a reason the reviewers are all giving it 5 stars.  Read it now!	2001-11-21

As I read I kept wondering what happened to the Lake Wobegon I have come to know and love.  This feels like a different place, and perhaps that is the point, as I suppose places are indeed different when examined from the perspective of a 14 year old boy.  Did I laugh?... yes, but I grew tired of the bathroom humor and endless adolescent facination with all things sexual.  I must agree with many of the other reviewers that this book is in need of a more thorough editing.  I hope in his next effort Keillor returns us to the Lake Wobegon I was longing for.	2001-11-14

The subject matter is certainly topical and unnerving, and even though you know early on in the novel that something horrible is forthcoming, the author's weaving of the tale is brilliant.  This could have been a melodramatic soap opera of a story, instead you begin to realise how the totally bizarre and horrific behavior of the mother is tolerated.  This is truly a fine piece of writing, and if you are in a book club this would be an excellent choice.	2001-10-02

Much of the writing is beautiful and poetic, and I appreciated than even in times of extreme hardship and war there is humor.  Now for my criticisms, the beginning is slow, even tedious at times, and the ending seemed like a huge cop-out.  Are we truly to believe that Corelli, a man of immense passion and committment, would return to Greece several times after the war, watch the love of his life from a distance and not inquire as to whether she was actually married till they were both senior citizens?  Ridiculous!  If you can get past the beginning, and take the ending with a grain of salt you will enjoy the middle.	2001-09-16

I love Sex and the City, the show that is, the book is another matter entirely. I know the series is &quot;loosely&quot; based on the novel which is just as well. If it was written like this poor excuse for a book it would have been cancelled after it's pilot episode. The show is ripe with raunch and wit, along with characters we truly care about. This book is grim and dark, poorly written, and ripe with people I would never want to meet. What we have here is a rare example of the show being far better than the book. I never thought I would advocate TV over the written word, but in this case, turn on HBO.	2001-09-16

It's simply another single British girl saga complete with the requisite dysfunctional family, quirky friends and on again off again love interests.

This is the only book in memory that I actually wanted to either throw out or burn!  If you have not read anything by Thomas Harris forget this one and read Red Dragon or SOL.  If you have read these but not Hannibal, trust me, avoid this book at all costs.	2001-07-14

No, you won't be reading this to your pre-schoolers (at least I won't be), and it does take a rather perverse sense of humour to appreciate this book, however it had me giggling all the way throught the ABC's.	2001-07-13

Yes, it's silly and implausible but that's also what makes it so charming and hilarious.  The section concerning Bridget's discovery of the &quot;Asian boy&quot; in Darcy's bed had me howling, and her mother is truly hysterical.  Overall I enjoyed this one even more than the first.  It should also make for a great sequel in the movie department.	2001-07-13

Passion, longing, lust, and the unconditional love of a parent for a child are all weaved together in a creative and innovative style.  This is a highly enjoyable book.	2001-07-10

I was reading it in bed one night and my laughter kept waking my husband.  When David and his partner hit France the laughs are almost non-stop.  If you need a good guffaw this should do it.	2001-07-10

I found the entire premise to be nothing short of silly (how many mothers would give up their children based on their supposed involvement in an accidental fire?) The plot was laughable and the main character pathetic. Sorry I wasted my time on this one.	2001-07-05

I agree with many of the reviewers that Bee Season is a fine effort for a first novel. I began to have difficulty with the plausibility of the plot as the book progressed. It seems beyond comprehension that a husband could be unaware that his wife whom he believes to be a high powered attorney, has spent the past ten years unemployed and deep in the throws of mental illness. We have all heard about people leading double lives but this was just too far fetched. The level of dysfunction heaped upon this one family pushes the limits of day time television (lets see we have a mentally ill kleptomaniac mother, a self-absorbed and obviously out of touch with reality father, a bullied son who becomes a Hare Krishna, and poor little Eliza the invisible child with a penchant for spelling who flips for Jewish mysticism and transmutation!) Don't get me wrong there were many things about this novel I enjoyed, and I believe the author possesses immense talent. I look forward to her !next effort.	2001-07-04

I could not however put this book down, the story is that compelling and well written.  I would highly recommend this novel.	2001-06-26

The main character Tamara poignantly brings back all those memories of being a 15 year old girl on the verge of womanhood, yet still a child in so many ways. This book would make for a lovely little summer read, I highly recommend it.	2001-06-21

The characters and plot are totally engaging, and my only criticism is that I wished it was longer.  This should be an Oprah pick.	2001-06-04
US	44761874	R2EO9OTLV7M19U	0375727345	498826779	House of Sand and Fog (Oprah's Book Club)  (Vintage Contemporaries)	Books	1	5	6	N	N	Felt like I needed a bath after this one!	This novel was chosen by my book club... Our overall review was a resounding thumbs down.  It starts off promising enough with an interesting premise, and did hold my attention till about the halfway point.  Then something strange begins to happen to the plot and the characters, they both deteriorate to the point of ridiculousness.  I was especially amazed with the character of Lester, who although seemingly portrayed as a loving father engages in such inexplicably reckless and stupid behavior as to certainly result in his children being minus their daddy. The novel is also gratuitously interrupted with raunchy ...descriptions that sound like a junior high school boy and his friends were penning the scenes.  Save yourself the aggrevation and don't bother with this one.	2001-05-12
US	44761874	RN3FVRV1G0K3	0316678104	155429542	Fortune's Rocks: A Novel	Books	2	7	8	N	N	Mediocre at best	I am a fan of Anita Shreve's work, and would site Weight of Water as one of my favorite books, but this overly long novel was a huge disappointment.  The thought of a 14 year old girl becoming so overcome with passion for a 41 year old colleague of her father's is ludicrous.  The characters came across as cold and totally unsympathetic, the dialogue was stilted to the point where I found myself laughing at passages that were certainly not meant to be humorous.  Give this one a pass, I wish I had.	2001-04-27

I just did not find it as laugh out loud funny as many of the reviewers.  The writing is weak, the plot predictable and the characters rather shallow.  I am a huge fan of British humor, but I would advise readers to give this one a pass.	2001-04-23
