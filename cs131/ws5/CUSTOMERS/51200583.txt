He mostly focuses on the Madden twins:  Joel and Benji.   Despite being quite different in various ways, the brothers get along well and have often composed their songs together.   Their father caused substantial hardship on the family when he abandoned them in 1995.    Joel and Benji's mother and two other siblings struggled greatly when their father was no longer around to provide for the family.   This abandonment definitely inspired some of the lyrics of the songwriting brothers.    In spite of hard times, the brothers formed their band in Maryland and got their start there.<br />   The author lists numerous concerts played by Good Charlotte in the U.S. and abroad.    He gives dates and places for many of their shows as well as other bands they toured with.   Many black and white photos appear throughout the book as well as a few color shots.   The Good Charlotte website was one source used by Small to garner information for this book.   But he also produces numerous good quotes  from various interviews the band members gave along the way.<br />   Mr. Small portrays GC favorably throughout the book.   The guys go out of their way to treat their fans well and keep ticket prices low.   They have also helped out various charities along the way.   Small shows the twins to be positive and inspirational as they try to help young fans cope with high school.    Good Charlotte is clearly not the manufactured band some skeptics make it out to be.<br />    Besides discussing the band's albums, this book also describes the bands involvement with the movies &quot;American Wedding&quot; and &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot;.  <br />   As far as info about the other three band members, this book is rather sparse.   But this volume is still worth having if a person is seeking to learn about Good Charlotte.   The author shows they are a band who have earned their success and shouldhave a bright future.	2003-12-22

The main drawback of the book is that the author apparently never interviewed Avril for it.  Also, he apparently never interviewed anyone  even connected with Avril.  So this book is written from a distance.<br />   Mr. Thorley describes Lavigne's childhood growing up in Napanee, Ontario.   She lived with her religious parents and two siblings.  Avril was a tomboy from the start, playing sports with the boys.   She played the guitar from an early age, practicing on it for hours at a time.    She sang in her local church choir and at country fairs.   While still in her early teens she got to perform on stage with Shania Twain.  <br />  Thorley describes how Avril was discovered and was eventually offered a record deal.   After being signed, she moved to an apartment with her brother in Greenwich Village, NYC.   Her first attempts at making music with those assigned to her did not work out well.  But she eventually met songwriter Clif Magness and they hit it off.   Once they paired up, the songs started coming for her debut album &quot;Let Go&quot;.   According to the author, Avril co-wrote all the songs.   And Thorley does a good job of describing the style, lyrics and overall appeal of the various songs off &quot;Let Go&quot;.   This book also provides some quotes from Avril about what inspired some of her songs.<br />   Throughout the book, Thorley gives Avril credit for being independent and refusing to be molded into someone she was not.  Her individuality comes out in her songs as well as her clothing style.<br />   This book also describes the success and chart positions of &quot;Let Go&quot; and some of Avril's singles.  And many of the awards are listed which Avril won.<br />   Besides the commentary, this book also provides numerous good, upclose photos of Lavigne.   <br />  In summary, this book provides a well-written survey of Avril's personality, her life and hermusic.  Until someone with access to the singer writes a book about her, this volume may be the best one out there.	2003-11-15

Hayes: One of the Good Colonels (Civil War Campaigns and Commanders Series)	Books	4	3	4	N	N	One Good Soldier	This book is another well done look at Rutherford B. Hayes by Dr. Ari Hoogenboom.   In this volume the author tells the story of Hayes' Civil War experiences.   <br />   Before joining up Hayes was not enthused about the War.  But as a soldier he quickly became convinced of the value of his mission.  By the end of 1861 he had come to see the war as &quot;a crusade against slavery.&quot;  <br />   Hayes started out as a major in the 23rd Regiment of Ohio Volunteers.  He soon rose to colonel.  By the end of the war he was a general.   He served four years in all (1861-1865).   Hayes last battle was in October, 1864.   While still on active duty the voters of Cincinnati elected him to Congress.<br />   Hayes' war action was mostly in Virginia, West Virginia and Maryland.  William McKinley stated that when Hayes was in battle he was &quot;intense and ferocious.&quot;   He was wounded five times in action but maintained his enthusiasm for being a soldier.  He proved himself a capable officer who earned the respect of his men.   He often defeated the enemy and helped achieve ultimate Union victory.<br />   Hayes had the luxury of seeing his family several times during the War.   He wrote numerous letters home and kept a diary.  These writings proved invaluable sources for this book.<br />   This book provides numerous detailed maps of the battles which Hayes fought in.  There are also several bios given of the various generals Hayes served under or against.<br />   Dr. Hoogenboom clearly understood Rutherford B. Hayes and described him accurately.  The reader gets a clear picture of the 19th President before he attained that office.	2003-03-24

In the introduction to the book, Andy Peebles describes John as \\"the finest interviewee it has ever been my privilege to face\\".<br />   This interview mostly covers John's solo work and his life after the Beatles.  Mr. Peebles asks Lennon about virtually every solo album John did.  He also asks about various individual songs from those albums.  John talks about the various concerts he played without the Beatles.   And he discusses work he did with other musicians, such as Mick Jagger, Elton John and David Bowie.<br />   In the interview John does refer to Paul, George and Ringo.  He also speaks of the childhoods of  Julian and Sean.  John mentions his personal assistant and future author Fred Seaman in this book.<br />   John describes his troubles with the record companies.  They didn't want to release some of his work because of the lyrics or album covers.  Then he'd get shorted on the royalties.   And on top of that some of his songs weren't given radio play because of controversial lyrics.<br />   John says he was set up by the police when he was busted for drugs in England.  And his criminal record in England caused him trouble for the rest of his life.<br />   Regarding the Double Fantasy album John says all the songs came to him while he was in Bermuda.  On that album he mostly used musicians he'd never worked with before.<br />   Ironically, Andy Peebles' last question to John was about his personal security.  John replies in effect that he feels safe and comfortable on the streets of New York.  Unfortunately, that false sense of security proved fatal in the end.<br />   This book shows that John Lennon in his final days was in good spirits.  He was sharp, honest and insightful.   He had numerous plans for the future.   He was already planning and working on his next two albums when he died.	2003-02-23

Sam Houston was LBJ's only brother.  He lived with and worked for Johnson off and on for decades.  In spite of the author's great admiration for LBJ, he is still willing to write critically of his brother.   So this book combines knowledge of its subject matter with objectivity.  This combined with a very readable writing style makes this book well worth reading.<br />   This book was written in 1969, the year LBJ left office.  According to author Booth Mooney,  Johnson viewed this book as a huge betrayal by his younger brother.  So much so that LBJ apparently quit talking to Sam Houston.  That it caused such a rift is surprising since the book is basically favorable to LBJ.  According to Mooney, the two brothers never reconciled before President Johnson's death in 1973.<br />   In this book we see Sam Houston as the easy going prankster.  This stands in contrast to the serious Lyndon.    Not only did the author live with Lyndon and Lady Bird periodically during the 1940's and 50's but he also lived with them in the White House during much of the Johnson Presidency.   So the author can speak authoritatively about not only his brother but many other politicians of that time.<br />   Sam Houston Johnson shows that his brother was a loyal Vice President to John F. Kennedy.    Both in public and in private LBJ defended Kennedy in spite of the bad treatment he received from Kennedy's men.  And according to the author it was Lyndon who convinced Kennedy to send men to the moon.<br />   The author contends that Secretary of Defense McNamara was two-faced and disloyal.  He believes that if Johnson would have dumped McNamara sooner the Vietnam War might have ended much sooner.   And LBJ would have been easily reelected in 1968.  <br />   The author also criticizes President Nixon.   He states that as a candidate Nixon was irresponsible and opportunistic in his comments against Johnson.	2003-02-10

One each on Johnson and Carter.  Robert Dallek and Hendrik Hertzberg are the speakers.  Their speeches from 1995 show great knowledge and insight into their respective Presidents.<br />  Hendrik Hertzberg was a speech writer for President Carter during his last two years in office.  Hertzberg is a good speaker and often used humor to describe Carter and his administration.  Hendrik describes Carter well.  He portrays him as a loner and someone opposed to pomp and glitter.  He also stated that Carter was no idealogue.  Rather he handled issues one by one as they arose.  And he spread himself too thin.  Hendrik  descibes some of the major events of the Carter Administration.  The Panama Canal Treaty, the Israeli/Egyptian peace talks and the failed Iranian hostage rescue mission.  Hertzberg portrays Carter as a courageous moral leader.  But he also shows that Carter was not a great political leader.<br />  Robert Dallek is a successful author and he shows here that he is also a good speaker.  Dallek studied Lyndon Johnson thoroughly  and clearly understood him.  He states accurately that Lyndon Johnson was a complex man with a seemingly contradictory personality.  Dallek quotes several stories about Johnson to show his sense of humor and his temperament.<br />  Dallek provides data about Johnson's popularity over the years.  As President, his approval ratings were good.  As an ex President he's less popular.  Dallek gives three reasons why he thinks LBJ's popularity has fallen.  His assessment is probably correct.<br />  Dallek then proceeds to rate Johnson as a President.  He gives LBJ high marks in the realms of vision, pragmatism and consensus building on domestic issues.  And he states that Johnson was very successful in passing his bills through Congress.  Dallek provides a whole list of good bills which Johnson pushed through.  In summary, Robert Dallek's assessment of Lyndon Johnson and his Presidency is very accurate and well informed.y is very accurate and well informed.	2003-01-29

It is not a book. <br />   A brief history of the cards and the 1888 campaign accompanies this product.  This deck of cards is a reproduction of the original deck from 1888.    The two Jokers are roosters.  The Ace through the 10 are pretty standard.   All four Jacks feature Senator Allen Thurman of Ohio.  (He was Cleveland's running mate.)   Cleveland's wife, Frances Folsom, appears on the Queens.   And finally, Grover Cleveland himself appears on the Kings.   Portraying a President as a King could have produced a backlash.   But hopefully, most people didn't take it too literally.<br />   I don't know if the original cards produced any votes for Cleveland.   But they are an interesting campaign item from the 19th Century.	2003-01-04

Using pictures, drawings and interviews, the author gives an accurate picture of the history and functions of this historic structure.   Besides the lighthouse there is also the fog signal building.<br />   The storms of 1905 on Lake Superior made the need for a new lighthouse apparent.  Numerous ships were destroyed or damaged that year during the shipping season.  And over 100 lives were lost on the Great Lakes in 1905 due to ships crashing on the rocks or sinking in the storms.<br />   In 1907, Congress approved funding for the construction of a lighthouse and fog signal at Split Rock.  Construction began in 1909 and finished in 1910.<br />   Mr. Hall does a good job of describing several of the men who worked at Split Rock prior to WWII.  And he also recounts many of the stories of the children of the lighthouse keepers.  They lived in the homes built next to the lighthouse.<br />   Mr. Hall also gives a thorough and accurate description of the technology used to create an effective and timely light in the tower.<br />   &quot;...the opening of the North Shore highway in 1924&quot; was the seminal event in making the lighthouse a major tourist attraction.  Once the lighthouse was accessible, the tourists came to see it.  According to the author, Split Rock received &quot;...five times as many visitors as any other station&quot; in the U.S. Lighthouse Service.<br />   Split Rock's fog signal ceased operations in 1961.   And the lighthouse followed in 1969.  But the tourists have continued on.<br />   In summary, Mr. Hall gives a very well done survey of Split Rock Lighthouse.  Its construction, history and people are all covered here.	2002-09-18

The Indians, the early German settlers and the cattle drives to Kansas are described by the author.<br />   The future President experienced life in various forms as a child.  He listened to his grandfather tell stories of rugged 19th century Texas.    Johnson listened to his father talk politics.   And his mother would read poetry to him.<br />   For fun he played baseball.   For income he shined shoes.<br />   This booklet provides a nice survey of the Texas Hill Country and LBJ's place in it.	2002-06-04

It is an interesting blend of fact and fiction.  Much of the dialogue is surely made up by the author.  But the dialogue serves the purpose of showing kids what life was like for Dolley in her early years.   And it provides an idea of how she may have thought as a child.   This book also contains many black and white illustrations showing various events from Dolley's life.<br />   Dolley Payne grew up on a plantation with slaves near Richmond, Virginia.  Her father, John Payne, was a Quaker who fought in the Revolutionary War.  After the War, Payne freed his slaves and moved the family to Philadelphia.  Unfortunately, Mr. Payne was more successful with his plantation than he was as a Philadelphia businessman.<br />   In Philadelphia, Dolley met her first husband, John Todd.   Unfortunately, Mr. Todd and their baby died from yellow fever.  Dolley also contracted the fever but survived.<br />   Aaron Burr was the unlikely matchmaker who brought Dolley and James Madison together.    Eventually, the couple moved to Washington, DC, from Philadelphia.   Dolley acted as hostess at the White House during Jefferson's Presidency.   And then she was First Lady in her own right during James Madison's Presidency.  During that time she was the only First Lady who had to flee the White House because of a British invasion.<br />   Dolley Madison was pretty, warm and cheerful.   She brought happiness to many.  So children and adults can both enjoy this uplifting book.	2002-06-03

It is easy to read and practical.  The points and subpoints are laid out clearly.  The author provides good background on the city of Thessalonica and Paul's relationship with the church there.  Various characteristics of the Thessalonian church are given.<br />   Some of the themes of the sermons/chapters of this booklet are:  characteristics of a good leader, the importance of the Bible, brotherly love, moral purity, God's will, discernment and the Second Coming.<br />   A few criticisms could be made of this booklet.  On page 12, the author states, \\"The true Gospel will always produce hostility among those who do not receive it...\\"  This would imply that all non-Christians are hostile towards Christianity.  That is thankfully not the case.<br />   On page 15, Pastor Heitzig states that \\"the Didache...was written by the twelve apostles...\\"  But the Didache was most likely written in the second century AD, after the 12 were all deceased.<br />   On page 19, the author says, \\"Jesus taught that the Bible was from God.\\"  It would have been good, though, if Skip would have stated that the Bible to which Jesus referred was the Old Testament.<br />   On page 20, Heitzig says, \\"You cannot grow spiritually on emotional experiences.\\"  But emotional experiences can be a great help and source of spiritual confidence for many people.	2002-04-09

While the subtitle promises &quot;Authoritative Answers&quot;, the author often admits in the book that he doesn't have an authoritative answer for many Bible questions.  Perhaps the publisher picked this book's titles.  The fact that the author does give various possibilities is actually a good thing.  But he should have chosen the phrase &quot;735 Possible Answers&quot; in his subtitle.<br />   This book has several good traits.  It is easy to read.  Richards is good at getting his points across.  He often offers more than one theory and then gives the reasons behind them.  And then the reader can decide which to believe.  The introductions to the various books of the Bible are also helpful. <br />   This book has some negative points.  The author's attempts to harmonize Matthew, Mark and Luke are often not convincing.  In Matthew 8, Richards incorrectly states that Matthew only lists one demon possessed man.   In both the NIV and NKJV Matthew lists two demon possessed men.  Regarding the 3 accounts of blind Bartimaeus, Richards states that &quot;There is no conflict at all in the three reports.&quot;  He is referring to the story as it appears in Matthew, Mark and Luke.   But Richards is wrong here as anyone who reads the accounts will see.  And as another reviewer has stated, the author often reads his theology into the texts rather than let them speak for themselves.<br />   This book's explanation of Matthew 16:26, about a man losing his soul, is not convincing.   The plain meaning of the text is rejected in favor of Richard's theology.   This book certainly downplays the significance of what Jesus said about forgiveness in Matthew 18:21-35.<br />   There is also a problem with the many verses this book doesn't address.  The New Testament contains several verses indicating a belief by the apostles that they were living in the end times.  The author failsto address these verses.	2002-04-04

Professor Kramer notes that these two men had very similar political views in spite of their very dissimilar backgrounds.<br />   The three selections from Paine in this book are from Common Sense, The American Crisis and Rights of Man.  A recurring theme with Paine was the absurdity of monarchies and hereditary ones in particular.   He points out that a child or an idiot can rule over a nation with the flawed hereditary system of Great Britain.   And he writes about the illegitimate nature of the British monarchy in its origins.  He believes the ones who started the monarchy were ruffians and robbers.<br />   This book has several selections from Jefferson.  \\"A Summary View of the Rights of British America\\" and \\"The Declaration of Independence\\" cover similar themes.   Namely, the terrible treatment of the American colonies by the British kings and Parliament is described.<br />    In the \\"Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom in Virginia\\", Jefferson well makes the case for religious freedom.  To coerce belief or punish opposing views is evil and foolish.<br />   This book also includes various of Jefferson's letters  to James Madison.   A grateful letter to Thomas Paine from Thomas Jefferson is featured here.   And Jefferson's eloquent yet humble first Inaugural Address appears.<br />   In summary, this book well demonstrates why Jefferson and Paine are given credit for so influencing the thinking of colonial Americans.   These two men helped produce the courage to act against tyranny.	2002-01-27

Fuller.   Predictably, this book is not light reading.   This volume makes it apparent why Dr. Bultmann was and is a prominent theologian.  This book has 5 main sections:  The Old Testament Heritage, Judaism, The Greek Heritage, Hellenism and Primitive Christianity.<br />  Professor Bultmann points out various unique features of ancient Hebrew religion.  Their &quot;strong sense of history and election...distinguished Israel from all other nations.&quot;  Also, &quot;a non-sacrificial form of worship&quot; such as occurred in the synagogues was unique.   Finally, having a God who was not tied to the land was unusual.    But the author does believe that the Persians or Iranians influenced ancient Judaism in several doctrines.   The resurrection of the body and &quot;hell as a place of torment&quot; came from the east.   Also, Babylon and Persia influenced Jewish apocalyptic writings.<br />   Bultmann also has important chapters regarding the Mystery Religions, star worship and Gnosticism.   According to the author, &quot;Christian sacramental theology differs little from that of Gnosticism...&quot;  However, Christians did not adopt the Gnostic idea of the pre-existence of the soul.   For Gnostics, their redeemer came before history began.   With Christians, Jesus was part of recent history.<br />    With Paul and the Stoics, the author sees overlapping ideas and vocabulary.   But one key difference is the source of freedom.   &quot;The Stoic is free because of his reason.&quot;   With Paul, a Christian is made free by the grace of God.   The Lord's Prayer is similar in content to Jewish prayers of the day, but it is unique because of its brevity and simplicity.   Finally, it is shown that &quot;the early Christian doctrine of man&quot; is very different from the Greek view.<br />   In summary, this book succeeds in describing what preceded Christianity, what surrounded it and the early forms it took.	2002-01-03

Moody and the Moody Bible Institute of Chicago.<br />    D.L. Moody was born in 1837 and grew up in Massachusetts.  He moved to Chicago in 1856.  Before the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln visited Moody's church in Chicago.   During the Civil War, Moody was a volunteer chaplain.   He preached to Union and Confederate soldiers.<br />     In 1870, Moody met the powerful singer Ira Sankey in Indianapolis, Indiana.   Together they formed an effective partnership.<br />     In 1871, the great Chicago fire destroyed Moody's home and church.   Besides his work in the U.S., Moody also toured Great Britain and Ireland as an evangelist.<br />     In 1886, Moody founded what would become the Moody Bible Institute.   In 1899, the evangelist died and was buried in Massachusetts.<br />    The rest of this book describes the development of the Moody Bible Institute from its inception into the 1980's.

Books	2	9	16	N	N	Another Book on a Controversial Subject	Mr. Burton does do a good job in making his views known.  Some of his evidence and reasoning are worthwhile, some are not.  Many of his interpretations of Scriptures are doubtful.<br />    This book does show various differences between the KJV and more modern translations.   Some of the differences are significant while many are inconsequential.   Burton claims there is a conspiracy among the modern translations to deny basic Christian doctrines.   But he fails to show that modern translators are intentionally denying the truth.   And the author is too quick to claim that modern omissions are an attack upon the KJV.   Burton apparently assumes that the modern translators had a KJV in hand and cut out portions of it to suit their beliefs.<br />    Referring to the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;, Burton states that &quot;This is the text that the Protestants of the reformation knew to be the Word of God...&quot;   But his evidence here is missing.   And again, on page 62, he refers to &quot;the Greek text that real Christians have known to be the infallible Word of God.&quot;   So again, this book relies on the gut instincts of &quot;real Christians.&quot;   Not a good idea.<br />    Chapter 4 is a worthwhile criticism of The Living Bible.   It shows how various parts of The Living Bible do a disservice to what the Bible really says.<br />    In summary, this book is worthwhile in various respects but cannot be taken as &quot;gospel&quot; truth.	2001-12-16

John Schrank was the strange little man from New York who took it upon himself to kill Roosevelt.  It is still the only time I know of when someone tried to kill a former President.  After following Teddy through various states, Schrank finally shot his target in Milwaukee on October 14, 1912.  <br />His main reason given for the shooting was his obsession with preventing any President from getting a third term in office.  But Schrank also said, in effect, that President McKinley told him in a dream to do it.   There is also evidence of a third motive.  <br />Regardless, Roosevelt went on to deliver his scheduled speech that night in spite of his wound.   He was subsequently transported out of Wisconsin and taken to a Chicago hospital to be treated for his injury.  The bullet was never removed.<br />Schrank spent the rest of his life in two different Wisconsin mental hospitals.   He was regarded as a model prisoner and died in 1943.<br />Mr. Gores tells this story quite effectively.  Relevant photographs are also included in this booklet.	2001-11-12

It is the story of what Roosevelt did after hearing of President McKinley being shot until Teddy became President himself.<br />After hearing of the attack upon McKinley, Roosevelt quickly took a train from Vermont to Buffalo, NY, to see the President.  After being assured that McKinley would survive, the Vice President joined his family in upstate New York, north of Albany.  Given Teddy's rural location and primitive communications, there were delays in getting telegrams to him.  When it became clear that McKinley was failing, the message was sent for the Vice President to come back to Buffalo.  So three different teams of horses and men had to transport Roosevelt in the darkness of night down a sloping and dangerous path for 35 miles.  It was during this ride that McKinley died.   Roosevelt was delivered to the North Creek, NY, railroad station in record time.  From there he took a train to Buffalo where he was sworn in as President.	2001-11-11

The classes were held at Miami University in Coral Gables, Florida. The 44 young men of that first class became known as the Class of 40-A. The instructor for these navigators-to-be was Charlie Lunn.<br />     The author, Colonel Whitcomb, was a member of that Class of 40-A. As such, he is uniquely qualified to tell the story of their adventures.<br />     Their stories are dramatic. These men were plunged into World War II with a vengeance. Several of them were killed by enemy forces. Those who survived sometimes faced situations worse than death. The men who were caught by the Japanese were often beaten, starved and killed. When American soldiers were transported by Japanese ships, the conditions were especially terrible. No water or air created maddening results.<br />     The author describes how demoralizing it was for U.S. troops in the Philippines. With the Japanese forces against them, U.S. forces were constantly attacked by shelling and bombing. Backups for the Americans were promised but failed to materialize.<br />      But with the aircraft that survived enemy attacks American pilots and navigators were able to bomb the Japanese. The Doolittle Raid on Tokyo is described in this book. And the later firebombing raids on Tokyo were also very effective at hurting the enemy.<br />      Wherever their missions took them, the navigators and pilots often had to contend with antiaircraft fire and enemy fighter planes. They also had to at times deal with their own damaged aircraft, tropical storms, lack of fuel and lack of sleep. In spite of the trying conditions, the navigators of the Class of 40-A were able to guide their planes to numerous successful missions against the enemy. And ultimately, American forces won the war.<br />      This book from 1995 is published by Air University Press, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama.	2001-09-24

According to Mr. Mooney, A Texan Looks at Lyndon  &quot;overstated Haley's case so baldly and was so scantily documented that I felt it could do little or no harm to its target.&quot;<br />  On page 5 of Haley's book the author discusses illegitimate government.  He states that the ruler fears the people and the people fear the ruler.  The reality is that LBJ campaigned tirelessly across the country in 1964.  He spoke to and shook hands with thousands of people.  Does that sound like a man who is afraid of the people?  In November, 1964, the people gave President Johnson over 60% of the popular vote.  That would be a strange result if the people feared LBJ as Haley said they did.<br />  Haley uses the 1948 Senate race to show that LBJ was illegitimate.  But he wisely says little about the 1954 Senate race.  In 1954, Johnson beat his primary opponent by more than 500,000 votes.  What basis does Haley have for saying his Senate seat was illegitimate after 1954?  If the voters of Texas thought the results were wrong in 1948 then they could have corrected it in 1954.  Instead, they overwhelmingly reelected Senator Johnson.<br />  On page 83, referring to the success of Brown and Root, the author wisely admits that &quot;there was really little that was criminal or illegitimate about it.&quot;<br />  In chapter 6, the author discusses the Billie Sol Estes case.  On pages 142-143, Haley admits that &quot;Despite all suspicions of Lyndon, he was never proven to be involved...&quot;<br />  In chapter 7, Haley credits Johnson with passing major elements of Eisenhower's program through the Senate.  But Haley sees that as a bad thing.  If LBJ was just interested in self-promotion or partisan politics then why would Johnson the Democrat help Eisenhower the Republican in such a tangible manner?<br />  On page 169, Haley faults Johnson for supporting slum clearance.  Apparently, the author believes that slums should be left intact.<br />  On page 172, Haley refers to &quot;the 1964 Civil Rights Act -- which will end the American Republic.&quot;  That bill did pass and our Republic still stands.  Thankfully, the author missed this prediction.<br />  On page 213, Haley refers to Secretary of War McNamara.  That position was apparently done away with in the 1940's.  But perhaps Secretary of Defense McNamara was not offended by Haley giving him the wrong title.<br />  While Mr. Haley has a strong command of the English language, some of his information and reasoning should be called into question.	2001-09-03

In each of the 14 chapters, the author describes an encounter with Jesus by various people in the New Testament. Most of the stories are taken from the Gospels.<br />Skip's knowledge of ancient Jewish customs and culture is probably the most helpful part of the book. This information makes familiar Gospel stories even more meaningful.<br />In each chapter, an encounter with Jesus is described. Skip shows that Jesus used different methods with different people. He did so because the people who came to Jesus had different requests and different motives. Some readily believed and some held back.<br />Skip also uses stories of his own to further make the points of each chapter. And he attempts to make the lessons learned relevant to the reader. In the second half of each chapter, the author appeals to the reader to apply to his life what has been shown.<br />Chapter 13, about the Apostle Thomas, is particularly interesting. It describes the differences between doubt and unbelief.	2001-08-29

Presidents Kennedy and Reagan are given as the two examples of recent Presidents who knew how to use humor to their advantage.  Ford cites examples of how Kennedy took tense situations and neutralized them through humor.   Nixon and Carter are listed as Presidents who lacked humor and had difficulty with the press. <br />This book also has several pages of reproduced cartoons.   The modern ones focus on Ford and Reagan.<br />Various members of the Ford Administration give examples of funny incidents that happened during their time in the White House.   President Ford describes his anger at how he sometimes was portrayed by comedians.   Members of Ford's staff give examples of how Ford used humor to ease tension with audiences, staff and others.   There are also worthwhile stories given here about how hard the Ford White House worked to win the GOP nomination in 1976.    Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld are two members of the Ford Administration quoted here.   It is interesting that they are now both back in Washington as members of the Bush Administration.	2001-07-29

The most important part of this booklet is where it demonstrates that the Reagan tax cuts did not create the deficits of the 1980's.  Craig shows that revenue to the federal government increased dramatically during the 1980's.   This booklet shows that the reason for increased federal debt during the 80's was because of dramatic increases in spending brought on by the Congress.   And it is shown that Reagan's ability to control Congressional spending was limited by the Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974.<br />Dr. Craig also makes the point that Gorbachev and the Soviets apparently did believe that the Strategic Defense Initiative which Reagan promoted would work.  Because the Soviets would not have strongly opposed S.D.I. if they thought it would fail.	2001-05-22

Truman: A Documentary History	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A Behind the Scenes Look at Two Presidents	This book reproduces many of the significant letters between Presidents Hoover and Truman.   Their contact started in 1945 when Truman became President and continued with varying frequency until Hoover's death in 1964.<br />    The prelude to the initial meeting between the two men is recorded here.  Truman himself recounted years later his invitation to Hoover to meet together in the White House in 1945.<br />   The two men definitely had conflicting opinions of each other.   Hoover initially saw Truman as mediocre and unable to comprehend the issues.  In 1947, Hoover would not stay at Blair House for fear it was wired.  Years later, Hoover expressed much gratitude to Truman for treating him better than Truman's immediate predecessor had.   Hoover viewed Truman as unpredictable.  While Truman was cordial and kind in letters and in person to Hoover, Truman nonetheless referred negatively to Hoover in campaign speeches in 1948 and 1952.  Hoover viewed these as personal attacks.  Truman's claim in 1965 that he never held Hoover accountable for the Great Depression is indeed doubtful.   <br />  Hoover's important work to fight human starvation in Europe after WW II is recorded here.  Hoover and Truman worked together to combat this tragedy.   The work of the Hoover Commission to reorganize the executive branch of the federal government is also recorded.<br />   Bess Truman's letter to Hoover in 1949 is shown here.   She requested Hoover to donate a portrait of Mrs. Hoover to the White House for public display.<br />Hoover's letter of 1950 showing thankfulness for Truman's survival of an assassination attempt is reproduced.<br />The speeches each man gave at the opening of the others Presidential Library are recorded.<br />I found one comment of the editors to be doubtful.  They claim the Hoover/Truman friendship is unprecedented in the history of the Presidency.  In April, 2000, Jimmy Carter stated that he and Gerald Ford were &quot;the closest personal friends&quot; of any former Presidents &quot;in the last 200 years&quot;.	2001-03-20

Eventually the two men had their differences and this book was issued without Kato's approval.  Also, the book came out in 1995 before the verdict was reached in the criminal trial.   Mr. Eliot does a good job of demonstrating how Kato when questioned by Marcia Clark gave a much different version of reality than he did to the author.   Fear, gratitude to O.J. and self promotion appear to have won the day with Kato.<br />This book has much information which is not common knowledge.   From this book a person gets a much more accurate view of life with Kato, O.J. and Nicole than press reports provided.  Nicole's day to day life is portrayed and her various likes and dislikes.  Kato's life with O.J. is also shown.  Kato accompanying O.J. to film shoots, football games and other activities is documented.  Various confessions of both Simpsons to Kato are recorded here.  Some information is given about each of the four Simpson children.  In short, if one is looking for little known personal information about the Simpsons and Kato, this book provides it.	2001-02-18
