The book contains no plot and is a self portrait of the artist himself.<br />One can understand why 'Tropic of Cancer' was banned in the US for over 30 years. Modern writers owe Miller a debt of graditude for easing the threats of censorship.<br />Miller's passionate diatribes are pure poetry and definitely influenced by the man he most admires, Walt Whitman.<br />For those purists who require that a novel have a defined plot, you will not like 'Tropic of Cancer' but for those who appreciate the artistry of the written word, have fun.	2000-11-13
US	51635830	R2FILTHFFAJ09E	0385333641	580864553	From Here to Eternity	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Personal hell in paradise.	This ponderously long novel, about the men of Company G stationed at Schofield barracks in Oahu, begins about ten months prior to the Japansesse surprise attack of Pearl Harbor. It deals with the personal struggles of men preparing for war in a peacetime army where promotion is given to the good athletes rather than the good soldiers.<br />The two main protaganists are 1st Sargeant Milt Warden and Pvt. Robert E. Lee Prewitt a hard-headed Kentuckian who is bent on being a career soldier. Warden runs his company with percision but his efforts are thwarted by his company commander, Captain Holmes, a brown noser with whose wife Warden begins an elicit affair. In the meantime Prewitt, an accomplished boxer and bugler, makes Warden's and his own life miserable by refusing to box on the regimental boxing team coached by Captain Holmes.       <br />Warden and Prewitt develop mutual respect for each other and Warden does his best to lighten the load on Prewitt, even though the other NCO's in Company G proceed to make Prewitt's life miserable at the urging of Catian Holmes.<br />The main female characters are the embittered Karen Holmes, wife of Captain Holmes, who willingly enters into an intense affair with Warden and Alma the beautiful prostitute who befriends Prewitt.<br />Warden and Karen begin their affair because of their hatred for Captain Holmes. Despite the risks, Karen and Warden keep seeing each other and fall in love. If Warden and Karen are to be together for the rest of their lives , he must choose to take a commission and give up the job he loves and excels at.<br />Prewitt and Alma's relationship was more need than love. Alma's  ambition being to save enough money to go back to the states and live an ordinary life while Prewitt's ambition, even though he was a non-conformist, was to be a thirty year Army man.<br />The story all comes together with tragic circumsatances on the day the Japenesse bombed the island.<br />The novel tells an interesting story and Jones does an excellent job of capturing the grit and brutality of the military and the sometime savagery of its men. I expect that the Army is probably not too different today than it was in 1941. Jones should know as he served with the Marine Corps in the Pacific during WW2.<br />I enjoyed the book immensely and plan to read the rest of Jones's trilogy.	2000-10-02

While the younger females all seem to be rather flighty and  promiscious. I am suprised that female readers were not put off by  Cheever's chauvinism.<br />Cheever achieves a unique yet powerful style with  the contrite journal of life that Leander pens. Especially poiignant is   Leander's letter to Coverly after the son reveals to his Father the  homosexual advances that he had encountered and his accompanying fellings  of guilt.<br />All in all it was a worthwhile read at least from a male point  of view.

This was my second experience with Faulkner, I read 'The Bear' in college  some 25 years ago. 'The Bear' was written when Faulkner decided that he  would no longer take it easy on the reader and stopped  punctuating.<br />Reading 'Light in August' is not quite as frustrating; more  like driving over a mountain, everyime you hit a straightaway you see  another switchback on the horizon.<br />The story is not complicated but the  characters are and Faulkner interweaves his passionate story by taking you  as far back as three generations to make the reader understand from whom  some characters evolved.<br />The best and most important character is Joe  Christmas, the abused mulatto with no sense of heritage whose atrocious act  is central to the goings on.<br />The passion with which Faulkner writes was  simply unmatched by his contemporaries.	2000-08-06

To the contrary, I felt that Stegener ended his novel quite  succintly by coming to terms with his own bitterness.<br />The tale of Oliver  and Susan Ward was one of courage, determination, and dogged stubborness.  Although you admired their good qualities, each was flawed to the extent  that they could not truly make each other happy. The fact that each lived  so long in their emotionless state was bitter irony.       <br />I have to  admit that at times I thaought I was reading a Westernized version of Edith  Wharton. However, on the whole I enjoyed my few weeks with Angle of Repose.	2000-07-09

It covers almost 100 years of tyranny by Ceaser Augustus and his predecessors.<br />Claudius, grandson of Mark Antony and adopted son of Augustus, narates. Deformed by birth,  Claudius is treated as a non-person by both his Grandmother and Mother.  Claudius tells of the trials and tribulatrions of the Roman empire as it is  ruled by three tyrants: Lydia, Claudius' grandmother and wife of Augustus,  who rules unofficially; Tiberius, brother of Claudius' father, who is both  paranoid and a sexual predator; and Caligula, son of Caudius' brother, who  is deranged.  All three will stop at nothing to amass and retain their  wealth and power. <br />Most of Claudius' family are evil and their treachery  leads to the demise of all the good ones like Claudius' father and brother.  Almost all of thefemale charcters are evil. Claudius,partially through his  wits and intelligence but mostly beacuse other family members view him as  slow and unimportant, survives everyone.<br />You will both laugh and cry at  the absurdities and tragedies of a power mad ruling class. Graves implies,  without going into graphic detail, incestuous activities that must have  created the genetic mental deformities that lead to the insanity and sexual  perversion that seem to grow with each generation.  <br />I recommend anyone  who enjoys a fast paced and historical novel to read 'I Claudius'. Keep a  scorecard on whom is related to whom and how they are related beacuse it is  very confusing.	2000-06-21

The story is about New York, circa 1880, and the  stuffiness of the elite class. <br />The author descibed her characters  succintly in Chapter 33 when she wrote &quot; It was the old New York way  of taking life &quot; without effusion of blood&quot;: the way of people  who dreaded scandal more than disease, who placed decency above courage,  and who considered that nothing was more ill-bred than scenes, except the  behaviour of those who gave rise to them&quot;.<br />The plot centers upon a  engaged lawyer, Newland Archer. From one of the finest families in New  York, he falls for an exotic beauty with a scandalous past, the Countess  Olenska, who also happens to be his fiance's cousin.<br />The young man  struggles with whether he settles into the staid and boring life that his  family name and status have earned him surrounded by people he despises, or  does he follow his heart. He defends the charcter of the mysterious and  exotic Countess Olenska, who is scorned by both family and friends. The  Countess, equally in love with Archer, makes the hard decision to let  Archer go so he can fulfill the life that has been planned for him.  <br />Beautifully written but dreadfully slow.	2000-06-12

I found those other writers to be wordy and dull, but what could you  expect from a bloody colonial.  <br />The story involves the effects that  three famillies have on each other - The Schlegel's inherited wealth whose  purpose in life is to enjoy the finest music,literature and art; the newly  rich Wilcox', arrogant and self important; and Leonard Bast and his trashy  wife. Bast longs for the same kind of life that the Schlegel's enjoy,  knowing full well that he will never better his class in life.<br />The  Sclegel sisters befriend the Wilcox's on a trip to Europe. After an ill  fated romance ends betwen Helen, the youngest Schlegel sister and the  youngest Wilcox son, Margarett Schlegel intensifies her friendship with  Mrs. Schlegel who is somehow more compassionate than her husband and  children.<br />After Mrs. Wilcox death, Margarett and Henry Wilcox, the  patriarch, become friends, get engaged and marry.The Schlegel's misguided  attempt to assist Leonard Bast in bettering his life results is humiliation  to everyone involved and eventually ends in tragedy.<br />The heroine is  Margarett Schlegel whose strength pulls everyone together at the end.	2000-03-19

I had the map but admit that Kipling's use of slang when referring to certain  characters was maddenning.<br />The odd assortment of charcters are great but  Kim is the star of the show. Kim, an orphaned son of Anglo parents, is  raised on the streets of Lahore where he befriends an old Tibetan Lama. Kim  accompanies the Lama on  his serach for a mystical river.<br />Along the way  they come across the regiment in which Kim's Father served. Kim is adopted  by the regiments two chaplains who turn Kim over to Colonel Creighton who  runs a sophisticated spy system. Kim is sent to an English speaking  Catholic school.The allure of the road to Kim is too enticing and during  school holidays Kim goes on adventures with the likes of his friend the  part time Afgahn horse trader and part time spy for the British.  <br />Kim  completes his education both in the school and on the road and he becomes  an important member of the spy system.<br />Kim seems to benefit from the  experience of everyone he touches and in turn evereyone Kim encounters seem  to be better off by the experience.<br />His relationship with the lama is  truly special and transforms Kim from street urchin into a compassionate  young man whose strength  keeps the Lama alive as they travel the  Himalayas.<br />Kim is a truly delightful book if you are up to the challenge.	2000-03-19

This should be required reading at the high school level.<br />The story is that of the Joad's, a displaced family from Oklahoma who migrate West,looking for work in the  rich agricultural areas of California.<br />No novel tells the story of  depression era America better than the Grapes of Wrath.<br />The Joad's, like  millions of other Midwestern and Southern farmers, lose their land through  a combination of generations of bad farming techniques, dry weather that  occurred several growing seasons in a row, and the depression.<br />The end  of the rainbow is California, rich in agriculture with the promise of  plenty of work. Along the way the family endures physical and emotional  hardships, as well as ridicule and humiliation.<br />Once they arrive in  California, the Joad's find that the labor supply is so plentiful that the  promised jobs are either non-existant or the pay is paltry. Furthermore,  the California land barons want the 'Okies' to stay only long enough to  pick the crops and they employ whatever means necessary to keep workers  migrant.<br />There are many poignant scenes in this novel and the character  of Ma Joad is truly a classic as she strives to keep her family together  and from starving to death. The last scene involving the loss of a child  and a straving man are heart rendering.<br />But the real value of this  novel is in the social conscience that it attempts to evoke. For his work  Steinbeck was villified as a Communist, although his later work showed  Steinbeck as a political moderate.	2000-01-16

For the time it was written The Rainbow must have been quite controversial. Themes such as sexual promiscuity and homosexuality are dealt with. <br />The story is of three generations of tempremental women  coming to terms with their own sensuality and femminism.<br />Like most of the  books of that generation that were written by British authors, the prose is  beautiful and poetic. But unlike its predecessors, the female characters  are strong and femminism is a central theme.<br />Personally, I prefer  American writers such as Twain, London, or Steinbeck who create more  beleivable and down to earth characters.<br />I just do not seem to enjoy the  stories of Wolfe, Hardy, and Lawrence, although I do appreciate their  prose.	1999-12-02

It caught my attention early and kept it until the end, although it left me with many unanswered questions. Some of his scenes are the most sensual, without being pornographic, that I  have read. Obviously Fowles is an atheist who tried to instill in his  readers that the &quot;godgame&quot; was justified since it helped  transform an egotistical and inmature young man into something better.  Those of us who believe in one true and loving God may have a hard time in  accepting the demonic pleassure that  Conchis and his cohorts obtained by  demoralizing and humiliating a fellow human being. If their intentions were  so honorable, then why did they leave their victim drugged to wake up with  a loaded revolver by his side?  But if Fowles intention was to make his  readers take an introspective look, he succeeded and told an interesting  story at the same time.	1999-06-19

Another extremely funny anti-war novel on the lines of Catch 22,  but not quite as good.  Billy Pilgrim driven mad by his experiences of war travels in  time and between worlds.  This book wouid have had a greater impact had   Vonnegut described  in more detail the horrors of the Dresden bombing,  which he witnessed first hand.	1999-06-19

Instead I was forced by my teachers to read fast paced thrillers like Great Expectations, Silas Marner, The Scarlett Letter and Return of the Native.  It took me ten years to discover that books were actually written to be  enjoyed rather than endured.    Had I read Catcher in the Rye as a teenager  I would have seen it as a great adventure by an angry young man. Today I  read it as a cry for help from a disturbed young man. If Salinger wrote the  book today I can't help but wonder if Holden, rather than taking a road  trip to New York, wouldn't just steal his fathers 357 and blow away all the  people who he believes wronged him. I also wonder how Holden himself, now  in his sixties, would critique his own actions. Would he be ashamed of his  behaviour or proud of tell his grandhildren about it? Somehow I believe  even though he may look back fondly at his actions,  he wouldn't share that  with either his children or grandchildren.	1999-06-08

The parts that will remain in my memory the most are the night the men  had  to push that cannon through the mud and the morning they  climbed MT.  Anaka. Mailer's descriptions were so vivid that you could  feel  how  exhausted those men must have been. I also particularly liked Mailer's  subtle references to the class separation between the officers and enlisted  men as well as the interactions between Hearn and Cummings. There was no  truly central charcter but Mailer's &quot; Time Machine&quot; asides  contributed greatly to the development of the character ensemble. The  ending however left me unfullfilled and should'nt a 700 page novel leave  you satisfied?.	1999-06-08

It reads more like a journal  than a novel. How could this garbage be considered one of the most important works of the 20th century? If this is the Bible of the  beat generation no wonder the beat generation receives barely a notice in  the annals of American History. At least Hayden and Hoffman had an agenda.  What was Kerouac's agenda? Get drunk, do some drugs, make love  and groove  on the people. What a waste of intellegence.	1999-06-07

I consider this a great collection of tales rather than a novel since you simply do not have enough time with  each character to become attached. Anderson seems to understand and capture  the flavor of small town America and that is what makes the book so  readable.	1999-06-06

The sad story of a couple who failed to staisfy each others loves and passions.<br />Edward, a passionate womanizer, spends his adult life trying to find sexual and emotional satisfaction while his wife, Lenora, trys to  &quot;fix&quot; Edward and his indiscretions.  Narrated by Dowell, a friend  whose emotionless wife is interlocked in a tryst with Edward.<br />Fascinating story of how people can destroy each other trying to get  someone to love them on their terms.<br />Sometimes I was not sure whether to  laugh or cry. Ford uses his words eloquently so that you can understand the  emotions of the characters.<br />I was dissapointed in the character  development of Dowell. Although he was a brilliant storyteller, Ford does  not let us into the depths of his heart as he did with the other  characters.	1999-06-03

I do not care to read anything further about the &quot;lost generation&quot; if Hemingway's characters are typical. The dialogue (of which most of the book is written)is corny and the only charcters worth  saving are the natives that are encountered in the Basque Region and  Pamplona.<br />Thankfully Hemingway wrote less than 200 pages. I kept hoping  that the story would end with Lady Ashley, Jake Barnes, Robert Cohen, and  the other &quot;ugly americans&quot; and arrogant Brits entering a detox  center and becoming the initial success stories of AA.	1999-05-08
