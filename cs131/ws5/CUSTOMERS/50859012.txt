Don't know which kind of Orgasm is right for you? The Bartender's Black Book, by Stephen Kittredge Cunningham, offers no fewer than three choices. The original Orgasm (aka Burnt Almond or Roasted Toasted Almond) combines vodka, coffee liqueur and amaretto. Orgasm 2 uses triple sec and white crme de cacao instead of the coffee liqueur; Orgasm 3 uses Irish cream instead of the vodka. If Sex On The Beach is more your motivator, you'll be pleased to discover four varieties as you leaf through this handy, spiral-bound volume.    If The Bartender's Black Book were a simple compendium of titillating or even interesting mixed drink recipes (Sex on the Sidewalk, Atomic Waste, Quaalude, Dying Nazi From Hell, Rigor Mortis, Wharf Rat, International Incident, Root of All Evil, Tongue Stroke, Wombat) it would join the ranks of dozens of other stimulating compendia; good reads perhaps, but incomplete references. The Black Book, published by the Wine Appreciation Guild, is instead a definitive professional guide, featuring over 2600 recipes for every variety of mixed drink (or drink mix), with special sections on garnishes, bar tools, a wine guide by Robert M. Parker, Jr., and anything else you need to know about drink preparation. Cunningham is a professional bartender whose penchant for detail turned him into a drink recipe collector, then into a careful professional compiler. He revises the book each year, adding dozens of new recipes, many of which continue to expand the art of nomenclature: Leg Spreader, Hot Tub, Dirty Ashtray, Creature from the Black Lagoon, Prison Bitch, Brain Tumor, Boston Massacre, Jumper Cable, Stuffed Toilet, Long Sloe Comfortable Fuzzy Screw Against the Wall with Satin Pillows the Hard Way, and whatever else the mind of man can think to drink.    Cunningham covers the novelties, certainly, but he also gives us the ammunition we need to handle the basics. As an example of the care with which the Black Book has been produced, in the case of Martinis, Manhattans, Rob Roys and related spirit/vermouth mixtures, Cunningham provides bold-faced cautions: \\"DRY can mean either make drink with Dry Vermouth or less Sweet Vermouth than usual; PERFECT means use equal amounts of Sweet and Dry Vermouth; SWEET means use more Sweet Vermouth than usual; NAKED means no Vermouth at all.\\" Speaking of Martinis, Cunningham adds a useful section that cross references more than 100 Martini variants: classics like the Gimlet and the Negroni, more unusual varieties like the Maiden's Prayer and the Purple Russian. A 30-page index cross-lists every drink in the book by constituent ingredient; Amaretto, for example, is used in several hundred drinks from the Abby Road to the Zonker; Dark Rum's applications range from the American Graffiti to the infamous Zombie. There are sections explaining beer and cognac varieties, all spirits, mixers and liqueurs, and an interesting monograph on \\"Being a Good Tipper\\" (think, 20%). The beverage references are generic (i.e., \\"Coffee Liqueur,\\" rather than Kahlua or Tia Maria, \\"Orange Liqueur\\" rather than Cointreau or Grand Marnier). The result is a true resource, prized by professionals, supremely useful to amateurs with standards.    By the way, I know you're wondering, but, no, I have never actually had an Orgasm, of any variety, nor do I expect to have any Orgasms in the near future. You ask why not? I'm still working through the hundred or so drinks that begin with the letter \\"A.\\" Atomic Bodyslam, anyone?    (...)	2005-06-03

Of course, Byron used the term \\"rum\\" to refer to all potent alcoholic beverages. If anything, the usage attests to the wide historical and social reach of rum. \\"Here is a drink,\\" Broom writes, \\"that has been the catalyst for the birth of nations.\\" The scope of Rum, the book, aided immeasurably by the superb photography of Jason Lowe, does true justice to the beverage. <br /> <br />Rum is distilled from sugar cane, and like sugar, it reveals a history of misery and pain. \\"Rum was slavery's currency; it made some people vast fortunes and helped others forget their misery,\\" Broom reflects. Caribbean sugar production was so labor-intensive that it almost mandated that slaves be worked to death and periodically replaced. The rum and slave trade went hand-in-hand, enriching cities like Bristol in England and Newport, Rhode Island. American rum, sugar and slave trade with the Caribbean led to the first major commercial rifts between the American colonies and England; these soon escalated into heated debate, then gunfire and revolution. America's founding fathers reached for rum above all other beverages when they needed to stiffen their resolve. <br /> <br />In the nineteenth century, technical innovation spurred the creation of a modern rum industry. The Caribbean nations stratified into various \\"schools\\" of rum production: Don Facunado Bacardi in Cuba developed light rums; Jamaica kept to fuller-flavored rums (\\"Jamaicans are hard-headed people. They weren't going to change.\\") In the twentieth century, changing beverage tastes in Britain (favoring whiskies), prohibition in the US, and the Great Depression of the 1930s signaled a decline in rum's popularity. Today's swing away from the whiskies and towards exotic mixed drinks heralds a revival. <br /> <br />After covering the history of the beverage in great depth, Broom moves to an exacting study of how rum is manufactured. It all begins in the sugar fields. Harvesting and processing sugar cane and its derivatives is \\"hot, hard, brutal work that has not changed over the centuries,\\" Broom writes. Manufacturing processes vary throughout the Caribbean. You'd never imagine that photographs of pipes and distilling equipment-much of it aged, all of it dignified-could be so exquisite. The passion for the machines and the processes cannot be separated from the passionate beverage itself. Rum is more than a drink; like salt, cotton, pepper or gold, it is a human story. <br /> <br />The key core of Rum is a section entitled \\"Pure Rums.\\" Broom covers each nation's rum culture and industry in detail, starting with Cuba, \\"the island that first elevated rum from an interesting to a modern classic spirit.\\" Cuba, the largest Caribbean island, is \\"the cradle for most of the world's great rum-based cocktails and is home to some of the finest barmen on the planet.\\" Jamaica, of course, has its own ideas. Rum is integral to Jamaican life. Even non-drinking Jamaicans use the beverage as a medicinal rub for wounds and to ward off colds. Jamaicans drink their strong rums-which may at times be distilled illegally-with passion and quickly-voiced opinion. Yet all the islands, and mainland South American nations like Guyana, Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Venezuela and Brazil, have their own rum heritage. French-speaking Martinique has its own rhum agricole-cane juice rum-subject to strict appellation regulations. Guadeloupe's rhum traditionelle is extremely popular in France as a cooking ingredient. Puerto Rico, home of present-day Bacardi, has become a major rum producer for the American market. The British have their variants; the Royal Navy long motivated its sailors by dispensing (or withholding) rations of rum. Rums are produced in India, Nepal, the Philippines, and all over the world. <br /> <br />You don't just sip or \\"nose\\" rum, Broom insists, \\"you pull all your senses to work: sight, smell, taste, hearing, touch-plus that remarkable reference bank in your head known as memory.\\" And, yes, Broom recommends a certain type of glass for your tasting, in this case a tulip-shaped sherry copita, a brandy snifter, or even a white wine glass; anything but a tumbler. Once you've refined your sense and taste for rum, you can try a hand at some of the \\"ancient cocktails\\" (Classic Daiquiri, Rum Flip, Tom and Jerry) or \\"modern cocktails\\" (Between the Sheets, Floridita, Mai Tai, Mojito). An extensive final section explains and reviews more than 180 major rum brands, many with evocative label illustrations. Ultimately, Rum-in all its ebullience-could hardly pretend to calm the spirit as Byron suggests; you'd require the real thing for that. <br /> <br />Food writer Elliot Essman's other reviews and food articles are available at [...]	2005-05-23
US	50859012	R3MOT83MEA0E5L	189126754X	940200066	Prosciutto (An Italian Pantry)	Books	5	3	7	N	N	A first-rate guide to prosciutto and Italian cured meats	My first memories of prosciutto entailed a veritable explosion in my mouth. As if hurtled in a flash to my first culinary Oz, I had the distinct realization that I was not in ham country any more. To call prosciutto \\"Italian Ham\\" is akin to calling the operas of Giuseppe Verdi \\"Italian Musical Plays.\\" Neither term properly conveys the sublime we find so often when it comes to Italy. <br /> <br />Carla Bardi's Prosciutto comes to us from the Wine Appreciation Guild's \\"Italian Pantry\\" series: luscious fully-illustrated volumes that give us the Italian A-to-Z on olive oil, pasta, cheese, and of course prosciutto and all its cousins. In truth, the book's original title, Salumi, gives Italian food devotees a far better idea of the book's ambitious scope; the term refers to \\"a vast array of different meats that have been cured with salt and spices then cooked or dried.\\" But even the term salumi fails to go the whole distance. Strictly speaking, salumi refers to any food (though usually pork) preserved in salt. The term insacatti refers to those meats packed into natural or synthetic animal gut. To do true justice to the book's subject, the author is forced to resort to the unexciting but accurate phrase \\"Italian deli meats.\\" Salamis can qualify as salumi, insacatti, or both, but these distinctions are best left for the linguists. We food fanciers would rather read, salivate, and go online to book trips to Italy. <br /> <br />Prosciutto is the only book I know of to go into true depth on Italian deli meats. The photographs provide as much as the eye can possible absorb without having to call in reinforcements from an additional sense. Take the page on culatello, a specialty ham produced only in the Bassa Verdiana area (Giuseppe Verdi's birthplace) in Italy's matchless Emilia-Romagna region. The photograph of the string-draped, pork-filled pig's bladder after the humid curing process has mottled the skin is truly evocative; of course we get the inside shot of the meat in slices, artfully arrayed. <br /> <br />Parma ham, a close regional cousin of culatello, benefits from a dry curing method. Legally, it can be cured only in the region between the Taro and Baganza rivers, near the city of Parma. The pigs involved are reared indoors, subsisting largely on the whey from that other inimitable product of the city, Parmesan cheese, showing that everything in Italian cuisine depends on everything else. <br /> <br />In addition to the fine photography on every page-in fact the high point of all the book's prodigious color-are the dishes featured in each of the 30 recipes that make Prosciutto such a valuable find for the cookbook section. Many of the recipes are elegantly simple. Finocchiona is a Tuscan salami variant that owes its name to a healthy dose of wild fennel seeds (combined with pork and fat from a pig's jowl, red wine, salt, pepper and herbs, all stuffed into a cow's gut). The featured \\"Finocchiona Salad\\" showcases the meat on a bed of arugula, topped by fennel and Pecorino cheese. Another recipe wraps the finocchiona in cabbage leaves, simmers it in tomato basil sauce, and pairs it with Polenta. Mortadella, developed in the Italian city of Bologna, cannot be compared with the mass-produced, machine-extruded bologna (pronounced \\"baloney\\") that still hoodwinks Americans into believing they are eating food. The book's recipe for \\"Fried Mortadella\\" dips chunks of mortadella in beaten egg, then bread crumbs, before pan frying. The recipe, as are many Italian recipes, is simple; if only the ingredients were not so difficult to find. At least the photographs instruct as they seduce. <br /> <br />You can't eat photography, but it does motivate you to hit the icebox at least to fill the void. The gustatory mitigation is at best temporary. The sad thing about Prosciutto is that the book can only hope to cover the 25 or so general and regional categories of Italian deli meats. In real fact, every town and village in Italy boasts its own proud variant, a few produced from goose, venison, wild boar, or even horse. The producers-even if they argue about politics, automobiles and love-undoubtedly agree that these products are designed to be enjoyed without hurry. I guess it's finally time to arrange that year-long sabbatical. <br /> <br />Food writer Elliot Essman's other reviews and food articles are available at [...]	2005-05-12

I picked it up personally on the Greek island of Santorini, where steam still percolates from the ground some twenty-five hundred years after the island exploded, upending the Aegean world. You can believe my powerful paperweight is the match of even the most truculent culinary book. It has certainly helped me plumb the depths of Greek Salad, a \\"Dionysian Travelogue\\" by American wine writer Miles Lambert-Gócs. Lambert roams Greece-the Aegean islands, the mainland, the Ionian islands-in an attempt to transmit, even amplify, a taste of Greece into accessible English prose. The result-even if you can taste Greece only vicariously-is the stuff of persistent reverie. <br /> <br />Taken individually, Lambert's 26 vignettes could only succeed in generating dramatic tension, unless, like me, you retain taste memory of a challenging retsina from Rhodes, or the best yogurt you have ever ingested. The whole of Greek Salad, though by rights it should be at least a coffee-table book (it is a tight small-format paperback), succeeds as it satisfies. I read just yesterday that recent surveys found Greeks, both male and female, to be on average even heavier than Americans. Evidently, Greeks do a lot of eating and drinking. The way Lambert tells it, the food, the wine, the soul of Greece do not spring fully-formed from a laminated restaurant menu; they are animated by earth, sea and sky. If you find yourself in Greece, you might as well eat, and wash it down with wine that originates just a stone's throw from your table. You can work it all off in the gym on your return. <br /> <br />Lambert has the imagination and scope to extol both the obscure and the predictable. Nearly every American \\"Greek diner\\" I have ever turned to as refuge from the night has offered a credible mousaka, a hybrid dish Lambert examines lightheartedly in his chapter on Larissa, on the Greek mainland in Thessaly. \\"Mousaka,\\" Lambert writes, \\"certainly cannot lay with the en croute delicacies; but on the other hand it does not sink with the fluid casseroles either. Sometimes it seems to slide in between the terrines and pâtés...However, the rarer low-built mousaka, with its slim strata, cuts nicely on the bias and, if highly flavored with sweet spices, can for all the world seem a soft, non-stick baklava.\\" If detail is delicious, Lambert serves up a feast, even if we want to pardon the author's French. <br /> <br />Or ferry-hop to the Aegean island of Syros, which Lambert visits for a second, longer look after having guiltily given the island short shrift in a previous incarnation. Here Lambert is hosted by shipping magnate John Vatis, who, after having acquired a taste for chardonnay in California, has fostered a wine-culture on the island. Vatis cultivates his vines \\"under Israeli conditions-no water and very bad land,\\" using elaborate drip irrigation systems combined with the best technology money can buy. At the outset, a California enologist had informed Vatis that the \\"official\\" temperatures on the island were far too hot for chardonnay. But that was before the enologist visited the island and \\"found himself needing a jacket on the veranda in the evening-and before John discovered that the temperature readings were taken in the daytime in a stuffy nook downtown.\\" At lunch, John's wife Helen prepares that other food I find on Greek diner menus: \\"pastitsio of a quality above what even an inveterately hopeful fan of Greek dishes might imagine that pastitsio has in it\\" (and a far cry from my own pale experience in American eateries). <br /> <br />Greek Salad handily transcends the American notion of \\"Greek food and wine,\\" and yet I find a strong Greco-American thread throughout the book. Lambert sweeps through Greece not only as a journalist but also as a representative of the United States Department of Agriculture, a role that forces him on occasion to visit food processing plants, consume their output,and say nice things about it. We Americans love foreign references to our homeland, and Lambert provides them, from the Greek sailors who wax fondly over their visits to US ports, to Lambert's own habitual pilgrimage from his home in Virginia to a Greek wine shop in Astoria, New York, where he crams his car trunk with viniferous products he simply cannot live without. Writers always have a choice of perspective, voice and personal character; Lambert's is one of honest immediacy. The writing is unapologetically personal, vivid, experiential; therein lies the problem, since the only meal we really get to eat is composed of words rather than olive oil and lamb. Those of us who can't quite swing a leisurely voyage to Greece had better hope PBS drafts Lambert to host a thirteen-part series soon. <br /> <br />Food writer Elliot Essman's other reviews and food articles are available at [...]	2005-03-25

Kurlansky drives home a real point: you cannot separate the fish from the men who risk and lose their lives to extract it from the sea, nor can the food be divorced from the dollars it represents. In culinary terms, I was inspired to start cooking with dried cod; it's the kind of thing you don't notice in your supermarket until something--this book in my case--sticks it into your consciousness with no going back.

We tend to know just a few dishes that have some loose association with Russia: Chicken Kiev, and Beef Stroganoff, for example, which both have significant French influences, or Borscht, a simple dish indeed. With the fall of that awful wall Russian cuisine has enjoyed a renaissance, even in Russia herself. Visson exploits today's new interest in this world cuisine with her exhaustive coverage of every conceivable course, all based on authentic, pre-revolutionary recipes. As an example, for kotelety alone she gives us five different family recipes. (It's a shame she didn't consult my mother, former professor of Russian, for another five). For shashlyk (Georgian meat on skewers similar to shish kebab) she gives no fewer than three possible marinades. Real cooking by real people demands such variety and depth.

Now that the forbidden fruit has got my attention, I am deep frying myself in this compendium. I read all the food science books and get something from each one, but I like Parsons' way of putting things. For example, he entitles a chapter &quot;fat, flour, and fear,&quot; the fear relating to failure or perhaps a piecrust. This is smart, because this kind of thing happens. Food science helps, with a good dose of hands-on experience. As Parsons tells us: &quot;The only way to learn how to make a good piecrust is to make enough bad ones...&quot; Of course, we knew that already, but it helps seeing it repeated in a science context.

There are books you re-read years gone, but I found myself devouring clumps of this book just days after reading it in the conventional way. Mort Rosenblum could have given us an encyclopedic guide to the &quot;noble fruit,&quot; but instead he follows his passions--and does first class journalistic digging--to press out the finest extra virgin essence of his subject. I also like the way Rosenblum writes, as much a friend as an authority. France, and its olive oils, comes first on the author's list, but he also does justice to subjects as disparate as the place of olives in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the promising growth of the high-end California olive oil industry, and even the seemingly bottomless corruption on the olive oil front in the European Community.

Alton believes in multi-tasking, and he has a point; in my kitchen, most likely in yours, 20 percent of the implements do 80 percent of the work. Even in the most capacious kitchens, space comes at a premium. Ever injure yourself clattering through a drawer-full of this and that? You get my point. Kitchen tools and implements need to earn their stripes in terms of both quality and utility. For this reason, Alton's great taxonomy in &quot;Gear&quot; lays out an extremely useful framework, if anything, to avoid buying something expensive and needless. The serious cook cannot help but disagree with something Alton propounds, and yet still benefit from the depth of his viewpoint. This is an important culinary work, and a good read as well.<br />Food writer Elliot Essman's other reviews and food articles are available at [...]	2004-07-03

Yes, he has his opinions and tastes, but for every statement he makes he opens a question to remain answered. I particularly enjoyed his excoriation of food faddists like Horace Fletcher and James H. Salisbury, his keen analysis of cultural food proclivities, and the good taste he exercised by including a lengthy quote from Duke Ellington on the &quot;cult of abundance.&quot; Near A Thousand Tables is a book for those who view cuisine as a multifaceted phenomenon, quintessentially human, and about as easy to understand as humankind itself.

It is universal in its scope, yet at the same time, how can I put this, British. A team of eminent culinary scholars put this one together. Now I know you're wondering, before anything else, if the flightless bird of the Antarctic itself is edible. The answer is, with some reservations, yes. The book's 500-word entry on its namesake ingredient shows at once the usual detail and characteristic humor of the Companion's approach. We are told that we are often reminded of the penguin by the paperback edition of a book or by \\"observing at social functions those few Englishmen who still dress up to look like waiters or penguins-it is never clear which.\\" The problem with the technically edible penguin is that it eats only fish and hence tastes strongly like its diet. The penguin is most important in the food chain for the guano it leaves as waste, an excellent fertilizer. South Africans eat the eggs of some species of penguins.<br />British foods-\\"Yorkshire Pudding,\\" \\"Cheshire Cheese,\\" Scottish Haggis,\\" and scores of others less known to us-get thorough treatments of course, but so do foods from all over the globe. One need only look at the companions to the \\"Penguin\\" entry in the Penguin Companion to learn something new about two quintessentially American food traditions. Move one up alphabetically from \\"Penguin\\" and you learn the essence of Pennsylvania Dutch cooking: the \\"interplay of sweet flavors against salty ones,\\" sweet apples, for instance, combined with salty ham. The entry covers the usual explanation that the Pennsylvania Dutch aren't really Dutch at all; \\"Dutch\\" was originally a term used in America to refer to people who spoke German, a corruption, perhaps, of \\"Deutsch.\\" Move one entry down from \\"Penguin\\" and you get a thorough entry on \\"Pemmican,\\" the product of hardened preserved meat associated with native North Americans. The word, it seems, is derived from the Cree pimiy, meaning \\"grease.\\" I've always known that small berries were added to a dried meat and fat mixture to make pemmican, but the Companion postulates a reason: the berries contain benzoic acid, a natural preservative, which inhibits bacterial growth. Skip up slightly and you get a full page on the important spice \\"Pepper.\\" Move back a few and you get the full story on \\"Peking Duck.\\" It's all here in exhaustive detail.<br />Not everyone is as insane as I was to read every entry, every page, but this masterpiece is truly a good companion.

US	50859012	R3R9OO17RASSS2	0688102298	748518137	CookWise: The Hows & Whys of Successful Cooking, The Secrets of Cooking Revealed	Books	5	37	37	N	N	Supremely Useful for Any Cook	I've just opened Shirley Corriher's 500-page masterpiece Cookwise to a random page, hoping to find true wisdom. If the random opening technique works with my Shakespeare and my dictionary, it ought to work with a book subtitled: The Hows & Whys of Successful Cooking. Sure enough, I've hit pay dirt. The chapter is \\"Eggs Unscrambled,\\" the recipe, \\"Mesmerizingly Smooth Flan.\\" The author (who lives in Atlanta) lets it slip that she has actually taught the recipe \\"in Texas to people who had been making flan for years,\\" and who subsequently abandoned their tried and true recipes in favor of hers. It's true that you'll see similar boasts-usually based on the work output of a female ancestor-in recipe books you can buy at any gift shop or truck stop. But Ms. Corriher leaves her Granny out of the picture; instead she relies on science. In the flan's case, using corn syrup with a little lemon juice prevents the caramel from crystallizing; an extra egg yolk adds smoothness; a towel placed underneath the baking disk prevents the bottom of the flan from overcooking. Tips and tricks are one thing-every cook should keep a collection-but few \\"kitchen secret\\" books can compare to Shirley Corriher's well organized voyage through practical food science.<br />I should hope the eye latches on to the word \\"practical\\" before it does \\"science\\" in the previous sentence. The author is not just a \\"culinary food sleuth\\" who roams the country giving speeches and fixing problems in corporate test kitchens; she is also a dedicated home cook with extensive experience cooking for real people in family and social situations. You can buy stimulating, even well-written, books on food science that may or may not give you techniques you can apply in your own kitchen, but Cookwise treats science only as a means to immediate results. This species of science isn't simply interesting; it can be liberating. (If the word \\"science\\" brings up nightmares from eighth grade, the word \\"perspective\\" is an appropriate substitute.) In her introduction, the author relates how thrilled she is whenever she learns a fact or technique that can be helpful in improving a dish. As an example, she'd never realized how important bubbles in fat were in cake-making. When you make a cake, the baking powder or soda you add doesn't create a single bubble, she reveals. These leavening agents only enlarge bubbles that are already in the mix. You, the cook, create the bubbles when you mix butter and sugar together as the first step in making your cake batter. The best cooks beat the butter and sugar together five minutes or more; the average cook combines the ingredients and little more. Your old recipe, or your granny, may have already told you to do this, but now that you know why, you're one step ahead. Technically, yes, this is science, but don't worry, there isn't going to be a surprise quiz.<br />You will find recipes in Cookwise-230 in fact-and many of them are as basic as Shirley's \\"beat-the-Texans-at-their-own-game\\" flan: homemade mayonnaise, sinfully easy fudge, lemon curd, pecan pie, sweet potato pudding, prime rib, seared scallops. They are sound recipes of course, but if that were all, Cookwise would be one of those volumes you'd have on your shelf for occasional use but little more. Instead, the recipes illustrate the many principles Corriher crams into this extensive book. Because only food fanatics like me read these kinds of books from cover to cover, Cookwise is structured to be an open-anywhere browser. An ideal place to start, perhaps, is with an individual recipe that appeals to you. Once you learn the principles behind the recipe and produce a successful dish, you cannot unlearn them, and will automatically apply them to dozens of recipes from sources far and wide.<br />I am now learning from these pages the useful fact that acids-with vinegar and citrus juices acting as the major culprits-also tend to discolor vegetables. Corriher gives me an immediate trick with the science: when you want a citrus flavor, say in a salad dressing, use the zest (grated peel) from citrus fruits like lemons and oranges instead of the juice. If I'm making a salad for an outdoor picnic, however, safety comes first; a high acid content based on either citrus juices or vinegar will help keep bacteria away.<br />I haven't yet read Cookwise from cover to cover as I have Alan Davidson's The Penguin (Oxford) Companion to Food (a thousand-page masterpiece) or James Trager's The Food Chronology (only slightly shorter), and there's a reason. I keep putting Cookwise down to cook real food for real people. Since I do read culinary reference works, I am aware that I may already have encountered many of the principles Corriher discusses, but I also recall \\"learning\\" about chlorophyll in eighth grade. It may have been useful if my eighth grade science teacher had lectured on broccoli rather than on the chlorophyll it can so easily lose if overcooked. It will suffice that Shirley Corriher (who, by the way, is a benevolent, cherubic presence who frequently pops up as a guest on Alton Brown's \\"Good Eats\\" television series) has pulled all the science together into a package I can use every day in my own kitchen. <br />Food writer Elliot Essman's other reviews and food articles are available at [...]	2004-05-28
US	50859012	R1J4TJOWZ2ADC1	1584790830	107539513	I'm Just Here for the Food: Food + Heat = Cooking	Books	5	5	5	N	N	If you want to cook with knowledge and perspective.	Among the television food gurus, Alton Brown is the thinker, the intellectual, the food physicist, chemist, biologist, and educator. In this book, Alton calls himself a \\"culinary cartographer.\\" He likes metaphors. He tells us that if he gave you directions to his house in \\"Proustian detail,\\" you'd certainly get there, but, without a map, you couldn't improvise yourself out of a blocked road, or a wrong turn. What's does this metaphor have to do with cooking? It's this: there's a big problem with recipes. They are the driving directions, in tenth-of-a-mile increments. They do not function as a map. They add little knowledge and no perspective. Without a food knowledge base that transcends individual recipes, you will have more failure than success in the kitchen. The truth shall make you free.<br />Alton Brown has conceived I'm Just Here For the Food as just such a map of cooking's complex terrain. He carefully follows his subtitle-Food + Heat = Cooking-in structuring the book. Instead of organizing the book by types of food (meats, vegetables) or types of dishes (appetizers, main courses, desserts), Alton takes us on a step-by-step journey through every major way to apply heat to food: searing, grilling, broiling, roasting, frying, sautéing, poaching, simmering, boiling, blanching, steaming, braising, stewing, and pressure cooking. He devotes the final third of the book to food-science-rich chapters on brining (with rubs and marinades), sauces, egg cookery, and a final concession to microwave cooking. An extensive appendix with very clear information on cuts of beef and pork (indexed to cooking method), knife and cook tool care, food safety and cleanliness, rounds out the book.<br />Alton's list of his cooking rules gives a good idea of his philosophy and what his book offers. For most dishes, you don't have to be that precise measuring seasonings, for example. For most dishes, you can try substituting almost any water-based liquid with another. You can switch foods of the same family: scallions for onions; or switch ingredients with similar uses: anchovies for capers. Only in baking (where professionals use the term formula rather than recipe) must you \\"not fool with Mother Nature.\\" In his television programs and in this book, Alton demands time and again that all tools should multi-task (e.g., a meat cleaver does double duty as a meat tenderizer). The tool that gets the least amount of use in today's kitchen, he remarks, \\"is the brain.\\" Cooking, he stresses, requires perspective and thought.<br />Alton gives us both. Take his chapter on roasting. The reason many cooks do not roast is because you cannot learn the technique from a recipe any more easily than you can learn to dance the tango by using stick-on footprint patterns. While most recipes call for adjusting roasting time by weight; Alton shows us that the shape of the roast is the determining factor. The roast doesn't care about how long it stays in the oven; it only cares about how hot it becomes internally. Delightful cartoons show how and how not to insert a roasting thermometer into your meat. We must respect the laws of physics, so Alton stresses that where we place the roast in an oven will dramatically affect the way it cooks.<br />Alton gives recipes at the end of each section to illustrate the points he proposes in such passionate detail. For roasting, he offers such staples as rib roast, perfect baked potatoes, and meatloaf, but he starts with roast turkey. Ever had a dried out turkey? I thought so. Alton doesn't shy away from controversy. Stuffing is evil, he writes, and basting is equally evil. Stuffing soaks up the meat juices, and extends a turkey's roasting time (and hence drying out time). Basting a turkey is useless, since the skin is waterproof; opening and closing the oven door all the time also increases the cooking (and drying out) time. Alton brines his turkey in a solution of salt, sugar and frozen orange juice concentrate and lets it soak overnight. (He devotes an entire section later in the book to the theory behind brining, which \\"teaches\\" the cells of the meat to retain moisture when the meat is later subjected to heat.)<br />Poultry skin browns because of the fat layers directly beneath the skin, so Alton counsels starting the bird at 500 degrees for half an hour to make sure the browning occurs before the fat has a chance to drip off. You'll then remove the nicely browned bird from the oven, reduce the heat to 350 degrees, cover the turkey breast with aluminum foil (because the legs take longer to cook), insert your roasting thermometer, and finish off the turkey.<br />I'm Just Here For the Food contains over 80 similarly enlightening recipes, all for basic foods you probably already actually prepare. The absolute cure for diseases like dried out turkey, badly poached fish, or soggy French fries is care, perspective, and a very digestible dose of science. Alton Brown offers us all three in this book and in his superbly conceived television series. His whimsical sense of humor, his cartoons, puppets and the hands that appear out of nowhere bearing essential ingredients, are just amusing little plusses.<br />Food writer Elliot Essman's other reviews and food articles are available at [...]	2004-02-02

Who, I thought, knows better than anyone else what constitutes a healthy mind? What if there's some aspect of my brain that varies from the definition? What if I eat what she recommends and end up turning into somebody else? If I am what I eat, shouldn't I change what I eat only with the utmost care?<br />Further, in matters of nutrition, I am wary. I firmly believe that people do not have opinions on nutrition; they have convictions. Whenever I catch wind of a looming nutritional crusade, I run lest I be targeted as the infidel. There's nothing worse than sitting down to a meal you love and not being able to enjoy it because you're worried about what other people will think.<br />But Natalie Savona is not the kind of nutritional writer who thinks you should be burnt at the stake for eating burnt steak. She has attracted rather than repelled me with her concentration on the blood sugar/mood connection. In my case, she's preaching to the choir. I remember what all that ice cream used to do to me in my younger days.<br />The Kitchen Shrink is a beautifully produced, large format book, filled with Savona's food doctrine. Though Savona includes some interesting recipes at the tail end of the book, her writing on the food/mood connection is the gist. She comes to the point quickly. Blood sugar balance isn't the whole story, but it comes first for a reason. We've heard it before (but we can stand to hear it again): the \\"blood sugar seesaw\\" puts our bodies through an unnecessary daily workout. It makes our daily stress worse; it is itself stress. Stimulants like alcohol and coffee, sweet, sugary and starchy foods give us temporary highs, then more pervasive, longer lows.<br />Savona suggests adding certain foods to strengthen the adrenal gland and build up the body's ability to handle stress. \\"At least three times a week,\\" she writes, \\"eat pumpkin, sunflower, sesame,hemp, and flax seeds and/or oil-rich fish, such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, tuna, or herring.\\" She follows with predictable advice about choosing fresh foods, then specific advice as to which foods, vitamins and minerals enhance levels of serotonin, dopamine, and other mood maintaining neuro-transmitters. She covers familiar ground in talking about good and bad fats, essential fatty acids, and the virtues of olive oil. But then she has an interesting section I found very useful: a complete strategy to use nutrients to give the body's \\"waste disposal\\" systems, like the liver, a needed break. Fiber and water are important here, but we should also avoid processed foods, too much alcohol, too many prescription and over the counter drugs, too much food in general. For the truly motivated, she lays out a complete 21-day body cleansing program.<br />After a short concession to issues of food sensitivity, Savona moves on to what I consider her most original work, individual sections on how to use food to alleviate specific mind/body complaints. She covers, in turn, energy deficit, premenstrual problems, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), insomnia, binge eating, brain fog, and depression. She indexes her back-of-book recipes to menus designed for each particular problem; for pre-menstrual problems, you'll cut down on salt and perhaps start your day with Savona's \\"Designer Muesli,\\" an amalgam of oats, barley, rye, wheat germ, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, raisins and dried apricots, with soy milk or yogurt. Can't sleep? Have a \\"Baby Spinach and Goat Cheese Salad\\" for dinner, or perhaps \\"Quinoa With Roast Vegetables.\\" For every mood, there's a menu.<br />Just as Savona was seeming too much the crusader for my particular taste, she presented me with a side bar, designed to get on my good side, that conceded the value of chocolate in maintaining good mood. She even admits that this \\"food of the gods\\" (as the Aztecs originally named it) \\"has been scientifically shown to have built-in feel-good factors, including mental stimulants such as caffeine and theobromine,\\" as well as the important mineral magnesium. Even though chocolate releases coveted endorphins into the brain, Savona counsels moderation because of its high sugar and fat content. (We all know that with chocolate, moderation is more easily preached than practiced.)<br />There's plenty of material in The Kitchen Shrink to warrant a purchase, even if you've heard much of it before. The book is truly handsome, suitable for gift giving or displaying on your coffee table.

You'll get to appreciate what a long road chocolate has traveled since the Spanish conquistadors first learned of it from the Mexican Aztecs in the sixteenth century. Chocolate charmed (and addicted) Europe as a beverage for several centuries, but it wasn't until the nineteenth century that European pioneers like Conrad van Houten, Rudolphe Lindt, and Jean Tobler (all of whose names have been immortalized as high-end chocolate brands), and Americans like James Baker (of the baking chocolate brand) and Milton Hershey (of the Pennsylvania chocolate giant) brought chocolate into the food industry mainstream. Cacao trees are maddeningly difficult to grow; harvesting must be done by hand; beans must be fermented, then sun-dried, then roasted, and only then is the cacao shipped from its tropical home to chocolate factories all over the world. In the factory, the cacao goes through a number of sophisticated and costly processes that result in the many varieties and quality levels of chocolate products we now take for granted.<br />Nick Malgieri's Chocolate is a demanding, no-compromises book, simply because there are so many ways home cooks can be tempted to relax their standards. Inexpensive \\"compound chocolate,\\" a product based on cottonseed oil, is one of them. It's easy to work with and inexpensive, but it's not the real thing. Chef Nick would rather have us learn to achieve a temper pure cocoa-butter-based chocolate, the way the professionals do, for better flavor, surface sheen and that quality chocolate \\"snap.\\" Tempering involves coaxing the fat molecules in the chocolate to line up in the right direction; it requires quick wits and sensitivity to small temperature variances. It sounds tricky at first, but Malgieri is a dedicated teacher; he won't let you fail. You break through barriers, you learn, and you become a better cook.<br />Food photographer Tom Eckerle's contributions to Chocolate are exquisite, capturing every chocolate grain and nuance of shade, but Malgieri's scholarship, depth and leadership qualities make Chocolate a must-have-on the counter, not the shelf. (It's a handsome volume but, go ahead, stain it.) The cakes section alone is book length: first explaining in detail basic methods for producing cake layers for chocolate cakes, using genoise and sponge cake rounds and sheets, then moving into scores of meticulously delineated examples of plain cakes (\\"Chocolate Sour Cream Cake\\"), single-layer cakes (\\"Vermont Farmhouse Devil's Food Cake\\"), rolled cakes (\\"Swiss Roll,\\" and the \\"Traditional Bûche de Noël\\" or \\"Yule Log\\"), layer cakes (\\"Chocolate Chestnut Cake\\"), meringue cakes (\\"Chocolate Pavlova\\"), molded cakes (\\"Chocolate Hazelnut Mousse Cake\\"), cakes in bowls (\\"Chocolate and Vanilla Trifle\\"), and individual cakes (\\"Chocolate Buttermilk Cupcakes with Boiled Icing\\"). Malgieri goes on to give equal depth to cookies, creams, mousses, custards and soufflés, ices and frozen desserts, pies, tarts and pastries, chocolate confections, sauces and beverages, and finally a pair of sections on the demanding subjects of chocolate decorations and showpieces.<br />Every recipe in Chocolate fits in with Malgieri's overarching purpose as an educator: to cover the field, teaching, explaining, and coaching serious, intelligent cooks, both amateur and professional. This kind of painstaking groundwork is necessary, if one is to show true respect for the world's most demanding culinary ingredient.<br />Food writer Elliot Essman's other reviews and food articles are available at [...]	2004-02-02
US	50859012	R3N1XIZOIZSNXY	0471359254	902748820	The Professional Pastry Chef: Fundamentals of Baking and Pastry, 4th Edition	Books	5	33	39	N	N	My Continuing Reference in the Kitchen	If you're looking for clarity and completeness, you've found your book. I've always felt that a &quot;professional&quot; approach can only help to raise our standards even if we don't make a living in the kitchen. Friberg delivers. The book is very well written, the recipes and technique advice well organized and conceived.<br />Despite the title, most of the 650 recipes Friberg uses to illustrate his technique sections are of household, rather than industrial, proportions. You dog lovers will appreciate the \\"Special Reward Dog Biscuit\\" recipe with which Friberg begins the book as a tribute to his Akitas, who will not touch the store bought variety. Friberg's recipe for Sachertorte, among dozens of other delectables, has long resided in my culinary kennel. You'll find all the basics, of course, but if you want to go further, you won't need another book.<br />Food writer Elliot Essman's other reviews and food articles are available at [...]	2004-02-02

The Professional Chef (7th ed., 2002) is promulgated by the venerable Culinary Institute of America (the other CIA). It is the institute's complete basic professional course. The book is profusely, nay, minutely, illustrated.<br />Since The Professional Chef is a text, written based on the CIA's experience in teaching food techniques to thousands of students who often come to the Institute knowing next to nothing about food, it is organized for learning. The book gives full detail on every basic culinary technique, explains scientific backgrounds of major food phenomena, repeats and recapitulates nicely. This is a serious text, but of course you do not have to master the whole thing.<br />Ever wanted to really know how to cut a carrot? The Professional Chef will give you illustrations and exact instructions on julienne, batonnet, brunoise, paysanne, fermière, lozenge, rondelle, and tourné techniques. Preparation techniques for individual vegetables-onion, garlic, leeks, tomatoes, peppers, mushrooms, chestnuts, corn, artichokes, peas, avocados, asparagus-get their own illustrated spreads.<br />Lest you begin to think \\"this is way too much detail for me,\\" bear in mind that the CIA has bent over backwards to make these materials superbly usable and didactically sound. Dip often into this true resource; double dip if no one is looking.<br />Food writer Elliot Essman's other reviews and food articles are available at [...]	2004-02-02
US	50859012	R15GRZI2NUAMSL	0517573830	909072844	La Varenne Pratique	Books	5	47	49	N	N	I keep recommending this book	La Varenne Pratique by Anne Willan bristles with more than 2500 full-color photographs. Willan is the founder of the famed Ecole de Cuisine La Varenne in Paris. Her standard are high, yet the text is as crystal-clear as her consommé. I opened the book at random just now to be dazzled by a two-page, twelve-photograph spread on just how to remove lobster meat from the shell. The instructions for complex operations like boning a leg of lamb, shaping a braided loaf of bread, baking fish in parchment paper, share quarters with basics like properly shelling peas, lining a pie mold, or testing the doneness of pan-fried meats.<br />I have bypassed wedding gift registries three times now and given brides La Varenne Pratique; two of these brides have already validated my boldness by doing the same.<br />Open randomly again, behold: color photos of fourteen types of root vegetables. So that's what salsify and scorzonera (vegetables common in Italy) look like! With photographs like these (eight varieties of beans, ten of rice, eleven of lettuce varieties) I am amazed that some magazines have to resort to publishing photographs of naked people in order to coax people into reading their trenchant articles.<br />Food writer Elliot Essman's other reviews and food articles are available at [...]	2004-02-01
