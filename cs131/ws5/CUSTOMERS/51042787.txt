He builds up an excellent non-human character. The protagonist, Peter DelaSangre, is a dragon trying to be human. He was raised like a human and finds himself confronted with his heritage when he goes on a quest for his mate.<br />Unlike some reviewers here. I enjoyed this novel. Troop's novel can't even be compared to LK Hamilton. He blows her out of the water with a more believable story.<br />My only complaint with this novel is that the dragons are green. There are so many other more interesting colors for dragons.	2003-08-24

Although I run a small game, this book is still a major resource.<br />The book includes an extended weapons list, rules for managing lores and influences and tips for organizing game and delegating responsibilities.<br />I highly recommend this book for Storytellers.	2003-08-12

The text was at times hard to read. The information about the First City was interesting enough for a storyteller to consider raunning a game set in the First City.	2003-08-11

Also, if you ever wish to bring werewolves into your chronicle, it has all the information you need.<br />This book is organized better than most of the Mind's Eye Theatre books.<br />All in all, I highly recommend this book to Storytellers of any WW genre.	2003-08-11

Here is the nit and gritty of the Malkavian clan. They are truly insane mystics not stuffed animal hugging whiney children, as they are often portrayed. These Malkavians have seen the truth; and the truth has made them mad.<br />This book has an excellent working of the Malkavian Madness Network and Clan specific Merit and Flaws.<br />If you like Malkavians or if you think they are all mindless children, buy this book.	2003-08-11

I've already begun intergrating some of the Crafts and events into my game.<br />This book offers a wide selection of culture-specific rotes which i find very useful. I find that some of my players have a difficult time making their rotes unique to their characters. More specificly I find the sections on India and Europe most useful for my game.<br />The downsides to this book are the lack of MET conversions and that the chapters are so short. I would love to have more information on the different crafts. But as with all game supplements: if you don't know it, make it up. ;)	2003-08-08

Lackey has done a wonderful job on Swan Lake (The Black Swan), and Beauty and the Beast (Fire Rose). The Gates of Sleep however is not as well done, but a good read nonetheless.<br />The main problem I have with this book is the pace of the love story. Dr. Andrew falls for Marina far too quickly. I would also have liked to see more about her Guardians. Lackey creates such wonderful personalities for them and then just cuts them off.<br />The environmentalist thread thrown in the soup was an interesting take but not particularly neccessary.<br />All in all, it's not a bad read.	2003-08-08

Her family only recovers an elbow the dog brings back -- But the story quickly turns into one of hope and renewal.<br />We watch through Susie's eyes as her family & friends learn to cope with her death and find ways of healing themselves. She watches as her friends fall in love and her little sister grows into a young woman.<br />Sebold's writing style is very smooth. She's a wonderful storyteller. The ending seems to come at just the right time. I thouroughly enjoyed this novel.	2003-08-08

This books has everything you ever wanted to know about Mages in the Umbra and then some. This book gives much needed information on what happened to the Masters that were trapped in the Umbra when the Avatar Storms tore the worlds apart and gives some hints one what os to come in the future.<br />Especially useful are the various discriptions of the many Umbra Realms and planes, as well as those that dwell there. The rotes are a very useful tool to get past the Avatar Storm and also give ways to travel around the Umral realms.<br />The downside to this book however is the lack of MET conversions. But the infomation jammed into this book alone makes it well worth the loss anyway.	2003-08-08

Once again, Harris makes a wonderful tale come to life. First Sookie wants to meet a vampire, then she's up to her ears in vampires. The vampires find Sookies particular disability (hearing minds) to be very useful. Add in a mysterious dead body, a maenad and a missing vampire, and you have quite a mystery to solve.<br />I highly recommend this book for a fun relaxing summer read. Harris writes in a style that is much more entertaining that LK Hamilton. Where Anita Blake is experienced in the occult, Sookie is still learning as she goes.	2003-07-23

However, I have still found this book to be a valuable resource.<br />Where the Laws of Ascension books skim over details, this book fills in the gaps. I have no experience with the previous incarnations of this game, but I like the direction this game is going in.<br />This game focuses on the small changes that characters can make to make bigger changes for the world. It gives storytellers more room to take the game in the direction they want it to go in.	2003-07-22

It also helps to despel the stereotype about the Choristers being a group of fundalmentalist Christians.<br />If you have any Chroisters in your game or even if you are considering having a Chorister in your game, I highly recommend acquiring this book.	2003-07-22

This book however eases that problem. I found this Tradition book to be very informative. The Rotes included are very useful and mostly subtle. This book has given me a newfound appreciation for the Hollow One Tradition.<br />More than a Tradion of Goth-Mages, the Hollow Ones are about survival. Their main means of survival is to remain as unnoticed as possible.<br />I highly recommend this book as a necessity for a well rounded Mage game.	2003-07-22

I started out LARPing with Laws of the Night -- the Vampire game. But after a while, I found Vampire to be too simple for my needs. So I decided to try out Mage and then I was blown away.<br />Mage has the power, the intrigue, the danger and complexity that Vampire had been missing. Instead of taking the same powers that everyone else has, you can create your own Effects. Sure, as an ST this gives me tons more work to do, but it's all worth it. Now players have more room to create more interesting characters and they have more power to make changes (as opposed to having some centuries old elder boss then around).<br />I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for something more in a LARP game.	2003-07-22

They DID give a brief overview of various eastern religious and philosophical beliefs. And they gave a better picture than the Karate Kid, monks or ninjas. They explain the philosophy of the Tradition in a way that is interesting (and gave me quite a few plot ideas as a Storyteller).<br />The book itself is well written in a style that is both informative and entertaining. The details of the Himalayan War and information about Do alone have made this book well worth the price. My only complaint is the books many references to 'Dragons of the East'.<br />This book is absolutely necessary if you want to have any kind of Akashic character NPC or player in your game.	2003-07-22

(And in particular, a certain ghouled mage). The greek style drama about the Massasa War was both interesting and informative.<br />Other than giving information about the Order of Hermes' reaction to Tremere and vampires and general, Blood Treachery also gives some information on the Celestial Umbrood amd gives information on ghouled mages.<br />My only complaint really about this book is that it lacks Mind's Eye Theatre conversions. But the information packed into the book more than makes up for this.	2003-07-22

This book gets to the nit and gritty of the Euthanatos. It has the details on how one can join some of the more selective factions and hints on the big Order of Hermes House Janissary plot.<br />The rotes included are quite useful and the stroy threaded through the book leaves the reader wanting more. The improved version of Iron Avatar is much more interesting than the one included in 'Laws of the Ascension Companion'.<br />This is one of the best Tradition Books released thus far.This book is an absolute MUST for Storytellers and players alike.	2003-07-22

Rather than seeing the Cult as a group of Druggies and Sex addicts, we can now see them has a group of mysics somewhat like the Dreamspeakers but with less traditional ways of releasing themelves.<br />The Rotes included are all very useful and interesting. I can't wait to use them in my game.<br />This Tradion Book has caused me to rethink my view of the Cult of Ecstasy. I think that this book has some insights that players and Storytellers alike would not want to miss out on.	2003-07-22

While the narrative was slightly confusing in the begining, but it does pick up after a bit.<br />The character archetypes, Rotes and spirit creation information makes this book a valuable resource.<br />The main shortcoming of this book is that it contantly references other books such as 'Axis Mundi', 'The Spirit Ways' and 'Werewolf'. However, the information on spirits completely makes up for this.<br />This book is an absolute MUST for any Storyteller or Dreamspeaker player.	2003-07-22

I remember that fall just a few short years ago. But had I known then what I know now. I would not have read it. Some people may like the spoon-fed type of information Cunningham  presents but if you really want to learn about Wicca. I recomend  Wicca:  The Old Religion in the New Millennium by Vivianna Crowley instead.<br /> I'm  not bad-mouthing this book, however. It is very good for beginners.

I felt left out of the conversations since I did not read the book. Now, I understand what everyone was raving about. Angela's Ashes  touches the hearts of us all with the tales of his father's alcoholism and  how his family struggled to survive. Who could not to relate to the story  of a little boy trying to grow up and be a man? While reading this story I  didn't know whether to laugh or cry.<br /> My favorite part of the book is  when Frankie hears his first bit of Shakespeare; \\"I do believe, induced by  potent circumstances, that thou art my enemy.\\" It made me think of the  first time I saw a real Shakespearean production of A Midsummer's Night  Dream. I was awestruck by the beauty and majesty of the Shakespearean  language. \\"It's like having jewels in my mouth when I say the words,\\"  McCourt writes. When reading this passage I was smiling thinking, \\"Wow,  that's right!\\"<br />While it is almost impossible to completely relate with a  character in a book, it is equally impossible not to know somewhat what the  character must be going through. I find that Frank's story is very  emotional. Yet McCourt does not blame anyone in his memoir. In a way, he  just seems to say, &quot;Sure life was hard but life is life. What do you  expect?&quot; It is this attitude perhaps that makes the memoir more  enjoyable to me. Whereas some writers might directly or indirectly use  their memoirs to blame their problems on others, McCourt just tells his  story.	2000-04-25
US	51042787	R34908A35ZB5IJ	0679746048	92211220	Girl, Interrupted	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Interrupted and Proud	Girl, Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen was an excellent memoir. I found it to be easy to read and understand. I finished it in two days. The speaker in this memoir is an easy character to relate to. The memoir is a short, hilarious portrayal of an institutionalized teenager as an adult looking  back on her two years at the hospital. While committed at the hospital she  still experiences some of the same things \\"normal\\" teenagers go through.  The memoir also includes copies of her actual records from the hospital.<br />  The whole idea that anyone could easily be classified as \\"crazy\\" -  from someone standing with you to wait for the bus to even the ice cream  man -- was interesting to me. I found this memoir to be very insightful. It  is interesting how a vast majority of teenagers go through a mental illness  at some point in their lives. Kaysen makes the point that people tend to  delude themselves into believing that they are normal and that no one in  their families can possibly be crazy. It made me actually wonder what could  really be classified as \\"normal\\" anyway?<br />  I found the fact that  Kaysen tried to kill herself to destroy a certain aspect of her character  interesting. Everyone had parts of their personalities that they'd rather  not have. Kaysen chose a drastic was of dealing with it whereas I  personally try to hide it. They are both self-destructive behaviors but who  is to judge what is right or wrong? It is natural to try to battle with  your \\"darker side.\\"	2000-04-25
