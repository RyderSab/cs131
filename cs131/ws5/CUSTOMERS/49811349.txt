Until I found this book I was struggling with the issue of faith.  Hagin's work has opened my eyes beyond anything I could ever have imagined.  I am in the process of ordering a copy for  my friend and I plan to order more.  If you really love the people in your life, you can't not tell them about this book!   Hagin walks you through the steps to learn what faith really is, how to reach the highest level of faith, and how to even write your own ticket with God.  He writes in such simple, yet touching, and often funny language that you have no problem understanding what he is saying and applying it to your life.  I read something in that book every single day.  I highly recommend it to EVERYONE working on their faith issues.	2005-09-11

This latest novel is one to join the ranks of his other mediocre and disappointing works.  The story begins interestingly enough, but fails to continue in that vein.  The main character has no real depth and his love interest, the typical aloof love interest of most John Grishman novels, seems to have entered the picture solely to make sure that there IS a love interest.  The main character's time in Italy is only sporadically interesting.  I certianly could have done without the long dialogues about learning Italian and about what the man in the restaurant is wearing.  To be blunt, there was entirely too much filler.	2005-08-17

I find the story to be lacking in depth and perhaps that is meant to be symbolic of the lack of depth demonstrated by the characters.  Overall I would recommend this book to those who like light books about the rich, New York set.  If you are looking for a thought-provoking tome you should look elsewhere.	2005-01-31

I have to agree with another reader who stated that Jones' writing was amateurish.  In fact at times I believe that she was adding a great deal of filler, as she could not possibly know everything that was going through the minds of those who were at the heart of the story. Now, having said that, I would like to add that I don't think this site is appropriate for a  discussion of whether or not Peterson is innocent. At any rate, I would only recommend that someone buy this at a discount price or check it out of the library.  I am generally not a fan of people who try to capitalize off tragedies and after reading this I stand by that even more firmly.  The book was interesting, but don't expect to find a classic.  You won't.	2005-01-23

Ever talented, gracious, and brilliant, she has created a masterpiece that is both humorous and moving.  Her love for her mother is woven into each word on each page.  The class and elegance her mother instilled in her is ever present.  In response to the review written by the white woman from Connecticut, I have to ask: are you kidding me?  You wondered HOW those black people got to those events?  Women like Fales-Hill are a bigger part of the black community than I suppose you fail to realize.  There is nothing NEW about this facet, something your friends should have told you after reading Our Kind Of People.  To everyone else, I highly recommend this book!	2005-01-02

Without a doubt the two women have entree into the elite world about which they write and their authenticity shines through on the pages.  The story grabs you from beginning to end and spins an intricate web of deception that is like no other.  My only problem with the book was that the ending was just a little too neat.  As far as my own pesonal vision for a cast...Lauren could be plyed by Essence Atkins or even Halle Berry; Manny could be played by Taye Diggs; Tandy could be played by Lynn Whitfield, and Ed Thomas could be played by the man who was Shelby's father in The Wedding ( I can't remember his name right off).  I would definitely recommend this book to everyone.  The biggest plus is that, as another reader pointed out, the book is not about African-Americans who are on drugs, or living in the hood, or making their money in the entertainment business.	2004-12-13

It was definitely written by two women who know the ins and outs of the NBA and relationships that revolved around the NBA. However, after having read Gotham Diaries first, I should say that this particular work paled in comparison.  The story began in an interesting manner, but as it began to progress there were times when it just got bogged down and to be honest...boring.  I think many of the issues in the book were just resolved a little too neatly at the end.  I would have liked to have seen stronger women.  Most of the wives/girlfriends were professional women who were dead set on maintaining those careers, yet they displayed a subordinance in their personal relationships that I found to be unsettling and perhaps unrealistic.  Either way, if you are looking for a superficial read, then this is a pretty good book to choose.	2004-12-11

I expected the book to be a great deal more interesting and I was sorely disappointed.  If you are looking for an interesting look at the life of the spoiled paris Hilton, look elsewhere.  The disgusting, cutesy manner in which the book was written does not even remotely resemble the wold party animal who supposedly was very active in the writing process. The book is filled with more pictures than actual words.  It resembles a coffee table tome rather than a good sunstantive book.  I would not recommend buying this book to anyone.  Keep your money.  She doesn't need it anyway.	2004-11-13

I have read both of Mr. Graham's books and I have thoroughly enjoyed both.  I firmly believe that he is shedding light on an aspect of the black community that has been hidden for years because people in this country can't handle the thought of there being a black elite that does not hinge on athletics and entertainment.  I admire Graham for showcasing the blatant and subtle racism that continue to plague this country even today.  The chapters on interracial dating, dining in certain establishments, and his time at the country club speak volumes and are especially poignant.  Unlike many on this site I appreciate Graham's lack of tolerance for interracial dating.  I notice that others who have responded talk of fairness and colorblind dating, but the fact of  the matter is that there are MANY blacks who date whites solely because they DO think that they are better than blacks.  I applaud Graham for keeping it real.	2004-11-13

Finally a book that heralds the accomplishments of a sector of the population that has been constantly overlooked: black women.  Throughout the book, the author discusses the age old question of whether it is possible to have it all.  Judging by the women profiled in the book, its not only possible, but imperative!  Granted some of the women felt that there was more that they could do or acquire, but a majority of them were qute settled and happy with themselves and their chosen lifestyles.  <BR>    The book is an easy read, something that is difficult to accomplish in some instances with nonfiction.  Chambers brilliantly weaves in self help strategies with colorful and interesting anecdotes.  I would definitely recommend this book to every black woman out there.  It provides a lift as you read and see just how powerful and accomplished black women are and continue to be on a daily basis in a world that only grudingly acknowledges them.	2004-05-13

I was expceting to be enthralled and engaged from the moment I picked up the book until I put it down.  That was clearly not the case.  I found the book to be dull and to only repeat details that have been mentioned previously in other novels.  The flashbacks were often distracting and served no real purpose.I learned nothing new from this novel.  All details of her sickness that were found between the pages of this book were merely repeats and could be found in any Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis book worth its salt. As a collector of Kennedy books, I feel confident enough in my discerning taste to recommend that all interested parties refrain from buying this book.  Go sit and read it at your local bookstore.  (Trust me, it certainly won't take long!)	2004-04-22

It was difficult to get too involved in it because the author maintains a surface level depth throughout the entire book.  In other words, this is definitely not the most thought-provoking, earth-shattering book I have read in my life. Many of the characters were one dimensional and failed to evolve during the novel. I have to agree with another reader that the author failed to bring forth Andrea's true dedication.  I was also sorely disappointed with the ending as I felt it was entirely cliche. If you want a novel that has twists and turns, this is not the novel for you.	2004-04-22

I was wrong.  Dead wrong.  Instead I find tales of deceit and lies interwoven to form a web of snobbery, elitism, and low self-esteem. Yes, low self-esteem.  For if one really reads betwen the lines and asses the information in Kessler's book, one will find that the people are lacking inmany ways that money cannot fix.  Overll the book was interesting.  However, I feel that Kessler indeed got bogged down with too much namedropping and with too many vague and uninteresting characters.  The story could have flowed a bit better and perhaps would have been more interesting had he gone more indepth about the bigotry that currently inhabits Palm Beach.  Still, this was not Kessler's best work.	2004-04-03

This book is truly the work of a highly intelligent and highly comical individual.  Far from being evil or dangerous for kids, the book is inventive engaging, and happens to be a real page turner.  The characters are far from flat and invoke sympathy or disgust.  The children are loveable, especially Sunny, the biting baby.  Sprinkled throughout the book are opportunities for children to not only witness an interesting story, but also opportunities to add new words to their vocabularies.  Add to this the fact that the book s are not overly dense and long and you have the receipe for the perfect children's book.  Important: This book can also be emjoyed immensely by adults.	2004-03-18

It appears as though Rowling is running out of steam ( and good storylines).  This novel takes us more on a journey through a troubled adolescent mind than anything else.  We see Harry go from  being a pleasant, resourceful, and loveable young boy to being a resentful, brooding teenager. I'm not sure I care for this change.  As a matter of fact, many of the major characters lose a great deal of their luster and likeability.  We see the great Dumbledore in a less than positive light, even questioning his usually impeccable judgment.  Sirius becomes a moody, pouty housemate, no longer the likeable, eccentric godfather figure.  All in all I would recommend that readers tread carefully with this one and avoid going into their reading with exceptionally high expectations.  I can assure you they will not be met.	2004-03-18

Once again, as is becoming the case with many Kennedy inspired books, the information contained is not shocking or even new to reader, despite what the author promises.  This &quot; missing history&quot; can be found in many other books written about this self-destructive family.  Indeed I read not one thing that captured my attention as having never been mentioned before.   Not only that, but the book seemed to contain more information about Jack than about Jackie.  Perhaps the title should have been  Jack Kennedy: The Missing History of the Kennedy Years.	2002-05-15

Kennedy, Jr.	Books	2	6	15	N	N	Sickening	The book itself is the work of a man who desperately wants to be seen as part of the inner circle.  Indeed he was not.  As one reader posted, Blow really did not have the opportunity to spend that much time with John if you examine the contents of the book closely enough. As I was reading I got the feeling that Blow had to fill in a large amount of space that easily represents his lack of true knowledge about the subject. The book was long and held on mildly interesting anecdotes that have already been previously published about the Kennedys and in particular John.  If Blow wanted to make waves, he should have revealed things that are not already known by the public.  He could very easily have gotten his information from many other sources, thus rendering his own account less than unique.  As someone who has read inordinate amounts of information on the Kennedys, I would not recommend this repetitious, boring work to anyone unless of course they can read it for free.	2002-05-15

Contrary to what some readers have claimed, this book DOES add some new insights on the Kennedy's.  Many argue against the truth and merit of this book, but I say those people are the ones who don't wish to have their illusions about the Kennedy women dashed.  Many of the facts included in the book can be easily verified.  In fact I admire Taraborrelli for taking many delicate issues and disussing them skillfully and in  a way that isn't offensive.  IN response to a specific comment made by a reader, Taraborrelli never said Jackie was jealous.  He said she got fed up because she realized what a loose cannon Marilyn really was and how serious the situation could actually get.  Make sure you know the difference.	2001-11-21

I was sorely disappointed.  Not to be mistaken, there are some humorous points in the book, but overall it seems more like an encyclopedia or some other tome of information.  There were too many definitions that made the book read like a textbook at times.  At times the book bordered on the pretentious side.  Still, in spite of my problems with the book, it was a pleasure to see a book that, like Our Kind Of People, showed the more affluent side of the black population in America, a population that seems to be ignored.  I believe the authors had a good idea, but perhaps their approach is the problem.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who takes things like this seriously because it can be a bit offensive I believe.  This book is clearly for the lighthearted.	2001-10-14

I am interested in pursuing employment with the FBI and this book gives me a good idea of what to expect.  I recommend it highly to everyone, especially those interested in working with the FBI.  ON a different note, this book was reassuring in the face of the recent tragedy.  It is heartwarming and reassuring to know that men like Whitcomb and his team will be there to assist in keeping our country safe.

An important piece of history revealed	I first saw Graham on a talk show discussing his book and I was immediately intrigued.  Here was a man who dared to write about an aspect of black society that has been ignored for too long.  I knew right away that the book would be viewed controversially simply because it put blacks in a new light: as entrepreneurs, lawyers, bankers, doctors, and in general citizens with a great deal to offer their communities.  I was not at all bored with what has been termed by others as &quot;name-dropping.&quot;  How are we supposed to be fully aware  and appreciative of the great history in this segment of black society if there are no names given?  I was saddened in reading the introduction to find that there are some blacks who respond negatively to this book.  This book is long overdue and Graham does an excellent job of capturing the essence of these prominent people.  Graham's book is informative and has interesting stories that chronicle the struggles that these people endured to pave the way for themselves, their families, and other blacks in society.	2001-09-06

Calling them niggers?  Spending thousands on the same belt in different colors?  Driving cars into pools? I've always wondered about Ethel Kennedy and now I think I know all there is to know. Including the fact that she was a spoiled, uninterested, racist who was obsessed with her husband, and turned a blind eye towards his affairs.  Any glamour I had attached to her is now gone and I'm utterly disappointed.  Of all the Kennedy brothers I held Bobby in highest esteem because he was a tenacious man who fought hard to rid this country of many injustices.  Now in light of his having married Ethel I question that.  How could he love and marry a woman like that?  She was reckless and had no respect for personal boundaries erected by others.  She was a poor mother and left the day-to-day raising of her children to nannies, dogs, horses, friends, and whoever else happened to be hanging around Hickory Hill on a given day.  I could appreciate to a certain extent, her love and devotion to Bobby.  However, she was on the brink of being obsessed.  She was horribly jealous of both Jackie and Joan and would make rude comments at their expense.  In short she could dish it out, but was hard pressed to take it.  It seemed as though she believed everyone was put here on earth to serve her.  In light of her &quot;I'm a princess&quot; attitude and her strong religious beliefs,  I cannot fully understand WHY she tolerated Bobby's infidelities.  All in all, this book was disappointing as it revealed a side of Ethel I would have preferred not to see.	2001-08-31

It offers both simple and complex ways of hiding your money.  There were a few areas that seemed inconsistent with what I know about bank accounts.  or instance, I have not yet seen a bank that does not require your SS number when opening an account, whether its non-interest bearing or interest-bearing.  The most encouraging thing about this book, is that its not a book that only the wealthy can benefit from.  EVERYONE can benefit.  In order to fully get the most out of this book, you must keep an open mind.  If you are a patriotic citizen who believes that the government has a right to know about all of your assets, then this book may not sit well with you.

I have been quite interested in offshore advantages and this book is the first I've come across that explores those advantages with the idea that you will remain a US citizen.  Other offshore books are geared towards those who wish to renounce their citizenship and move to another country.  schneider's book goes into a great amount of detail on the legalities of offshore havens and even has a nice section that takes a look at each individual haven.  You can find out which laws certain havens adhere to, how much it costs to bank there, privacy ratings, and much more.  The only problem I had with the book is that a healthy portion of the book was geared towards those who wish to start an actual bank offshore, not just a bank account.  However, Schneider clearly knows what he is talking about and anyone would do well to take a look at this book.  In the Apeendix is a list of countries, the banks located there, the type of banking each one does, and how to get in contact with them, information we normally would have to pay an arm and a leg for.

US	49811349	RCZYT31YO4ERH	0740703579	669904317	The Millionaire Mind	Books	2	10	24	N	N	Not very interesting	In recent months I have become very interested in personal finance and have found myself perusing the aisles of the bookstores looking for good books that avoid repeating what every other book says: save 10-15% of your earnings, invest, and look into good retirement plans.  Upon locating this book, I thought surely I had stumbled upon something innovative and insightful, surely this book would put all others to shame.  Well, it disappointed me entirely.  The main theme for the book is live cheaply so that you can acquire wealth and then...continue to live cheaply.  As many other posters pondered, what is the point of acquiring all of this wealth, only to hold on to it with a thightfist.  Truly you do not gain anything when you behave like a miser.  I was not impressed with the values that many of the millionaire hold in high esteem as contributing to their wealth.  I see no reason not to enjoy nice things.  True it is encouraging to find that many millionaires were not valedictorians and in the top SAT percentie, but how many poeple actually ejoy such success stories?  Only a select few.  I would also like to once again agree with another poster that the people interviewed for the book were very uninteresting and one-dimensional.  The book hails the typical American values that in essence are really associated with a male-dominated culture: have a wife at home, go out and break your back, spend lots of time with your kids, and above all STAY MARRIED to avoid having to pay for a costly divorce.  Perhaps all of these values and tidbits would serve as being helpful in a Dummy's guide to Living the American Dream, but in a finance book, there is no room for it.  The book is repetitous and honestly does not appear to cover a broad range of millionaires, only the miserly ones.  In short, I would really not recommend this book to anyone looking for sound advice on joining the ranks of millionaires.	2001-04-24

The women profiled in the book were affluent and so the idea of staying home to raise children is more socially acceptable for them. I think its based more on social aspects than on a real desire to nurture the child. Still after hearing about all the activities these women involve themselves in, I don't see how they really have time to raise and nurture their children.  IN essence they are staying homew because they don't want to actually hold down a job.       I was very disturbed at the constant mantra of putting your husband and children first.  By the end of the book, if I were a weak person, I would wrongfully think that if I have children and don't stay at home, that not only will I be a bad mother with children who hate me, but my marriage will fail because I did not coddle my husband and put his needs abouve mine.  Why, I have to ask, would anyone want a marriage of this kind?   The authors justify husbands taking a less active role in making the marriage work and in raising the children.          Frankly I do not appreciate the jibs at working mothers.  A good book about SAHM's would show a broad spectrum and also would focus on celebrating staying at home rather than knocking working mothers.             The authors make a great deal of generalizations that are really not true.  The happiness they generally speak of that SAHM's moms have is just not something that I have encountered when being around SAHM's. They are the women whose husbands are having affairs because the wife has no interest in intimacy or because the husband is no longer intrigued by the wife.  They are the ones who begin to feel burned out and moan about people taking them for granted.  I resent the authors blatantly saying that having a woman at home makes for better and more stable marriages.  I fail to see how these marriages are TRUE partnerships.  All in all I think the authors wasted a great deal of their time in writing this bok and its disappointing because both of them had carrers in writing and s I would expect better work from writers.	2001-02-15

Once again JK Rowling managed to grab my attention and retain it throughout 700+ pages.  Imagination abounds as Harry faces a very challenging and trying situation.  The book was funny, witty, and inventive.  However, I was a little disappointed with the sad ending and felt that it was unnecessary.  As I'm sure peple would not like for me to reveal the ending in case they have not read the book, I will refrain from divulging the ending.  Still, it cast a slight shadow over the book.	2001-02-15

I too considered him to be an Uncle Tom and a traitor to his race.  However, I changed my mind after reading the book.  I now see Darden as a man who stood up for what HE believed was right.  Still there is a bit of bias on his part towards OJ. I have to wonder if his desire to convict OJ came out of belief in OJ's guilt or if Darden wanted to convict OJ for being a somewhat poorly educated man who Darden feels was unjustly rewarded with riches.  I feel as though Darden's ideas about the race factor in the trial were a bit warped considering the fact that if Furhman lied aobut his racial epithets, he would surely lie about planting evidence.	2000-12-19

Second I don't understand why the women don't insist that the husbands take a more active role in parenting.  Third i don't appreciate these women trying to throw stones at working mothers. I certianly have more respect for working mothers.  Sorry, but you will never convince me that those kids in Columbine shot up that school because their mothers didn't stay home.  THAT in itself is a whole different issue of parenting.   Quite frankly the book is sickening and takes women all the way back to the 1950's as far as women's roles.  I was particularly appalled when the women claimed that in their partnership marriages, their husbands careers and lives came first.  What is equal about that?  I'm sure the men DO support their wives staying home because they are getting spoiled out of the deal.  I threw my copy away.	2000-12-12
