That said, Mr. Silva has written an intriguing work set with the all-too-real world of terrorism as backdrop.  Michael Osborne is a C.I.A. analyst who works in a relatively safe world after beginning his career as a field agent.  When an airliner is shot down off the coast of New York, Michael begins to take interest when the murderer is found dead, his body bearing the marks of an unknown killer with whom Michael has a past.  As Michael begins to investigate, he finds that the conspiracy is world-wide and there is more to the tragedy than it first appeared.  A decent read.	2005-09-15

I enjoyed this book a great deal, even though I read it on a 747 flying out of Kennedy Airport towards London! This is Silva's second book, and the first to deal with the threat of international terrorism. It is quite topical in a sense, considering the fate of TWA600. It is an excellent thriller, fast paced, with well-developed characters. Clearly a good training for Silva, since his character development in his subsequent novels was outstanding. I do not agree with some other reviewers who state that the plot is not believable. I believe that it is all too believable. The story starts when an international airliner is downed by a missile fired from a terrorist on a boat. The terrorist kills his accomplice in a signature fashion, which comes to the attention of a CIA analyst, Michael Osborne, who has his own personal score to settle with the terrorist. And so we plunge into the intriguing and scary world of international terrorism, and the anti-terrorist efforts spearheaded by Osborne. Of course, there are some interesting sub-plots woven in as well, often dealing with the personal lives of the main players. It was a damn good read, and can I strongly recommend this book.	2005-07-28

A recent article said this, \\"David Kirby's new book, 'Evidence of Harm' is a must read for anyone seeking to understand the connection between autism and childhood vaccines containing the mercury based preservative Thimerosal. The book examines the political and legal side of this travesty and presents information that cannot be disputed.  The book is a result of a thorough investigation and is by no means an anti-vaccine campaign. But most importantly, it's obvious that Kirby has no ax to grind.\\"   <br /> <br />After reading most of this book, and better yet interviewing Mr. Kirby on my radio show in Sheboygan, WI, I still have many more questions than answers.  It is frightening that this book is being made into a movie ala Erin Brockovich.  When Kirby told me about this, he was excited.  I am scared to death.   The only good thing is that the movie will bring the pseudo science in autism, like chelation and radical diets to light and show people how silly they are.   The reviewer aforementioned says it's a thorough review of the information.  That, I think, is absolutely incorrect.  Kirby, without knowing it, is being subtly influenced by the vaccine paranoia people.  Beware of books like these because they lead with fear and not knowledge!  <br /> <br />Thanks a lot for letting me vent.

Gayle Lynds' \\"Masquerade,\\" which seems to predate this novel by a couple years, also deals with an international assassin for hire.  Her sequel, \\"The Coil,\\" has a similar shadowy international group.  I am still waiting for her next novel.<br /><br />The early parts of this novel by Silva seem a little fragmented and superficial, with some parts a little peripheral to the main plot.  It comes together better as the novel progresses.  There is the shadowy international group of people with money and influence who are willing to use assassination to disrupt the peace - in war and disorder there is profit.  There is a CIA employee and his wife, a lawyer for a Washington firm, who seem to be the white hats.  There are newspaper reporters, intelligence agents, and politicans.  Everyone has their own agenda, and you can't really trust anyone.  Double crosses abound, and some people are not entirely what you think they are.<br /><br />Of course there is the assassin, trained to kill since he was a teenager.  A man without a known face, planted by the Soviet Union under deep cover, and eventually going independent, taking assignments through his handler.  He is a cold blooded killer willing to kill anyone who can identify him, and he has his money well concealed.  He has many identities, and is fluent in many languages.  He looks forward to retirement after this \\"last job,\\" and there is no trust between the assassin and his employers.  If a painter moves into your neighborhood (landscapes and portraits), and he leads a quiet life, has a taste for moderate priced wine, and does his own shopping and cooking, well...<br /><br />It's hard to say if there is a winner in this novel.  There is a lot of collateral damage.  The white hats seem to prevail to a point, but the real black hats cover their tracks by killing potential witnesses.  There are always sacrificial goats.

Gergen has a way of seeing the character of politicians, the good and the bad.  I found his thoughts on Nixon, Ford, Clinton and Reagan very interesting, especially Reagan.  By working side by side with Reagan, Gergen learned that real leadership is not just based on intelligence, but on a dream that comes \\"from within.\\"  Although Clinton had the most raw intelligence, Reagan rates higher because he used what he had a lot better.  I agree with that.  He also makes some interesting observation about Nixon and how he let power go to his head in the final months of his administration, even though he could be a \\"master of political strategy.\\"  After listening to Gergen talk, Jerry Ford sounds like perhaps the nicest president.  I also found it interesting when he compared Nixon and Clinton, two immensely talented politicians who succumbed to their demons.  It was also interesting when he talked about how Reagan was secure within himself and didn't have to prove anything to anyone, while Clinton was a bit insecure and tended to alienate his staff especially during times of high tension in the West Wing.<br /><br />I also found it interesting to hear David talk about the leadership qualities he absorbed from the great men he worked for.

In the beginning chapter, he admits that there are disturbing questions worthy of great debate, questions whose answers will form the foundation for students and learners.   What will education do to take the edge off of racial tension?  How will education help prevent civil and world wars?  Back in 1969, Carl Rogers saw some disturbing trends.  He talked about the possible student revolts against this conservative and rigid institution which could be very harmful to the entire process. Some of his worst nightmares are taking effect today.  School violence in our inner cities is sky rocketing with no end in sight. Child are losing respect for their teachers at a very young age. There seems to be a lot less respect for educators than there was 25 years ago when I was in school.  Rogers was also concerned with profit-making corporations getting too much of a hand in education.  This is a big concern these days with the society taking on more and more of a corporate feel.  If Dr. Rogers saw education at a crisis point in 1969, then where are we now??   <br /> <br />In the book, CR also differentiates experiental (self-directed)learning from meaningless rote type learning, where there is no personal context for connection.  To have freedom to learn, a person's self-confidence and curiousity grows along with intense curiousity to learn more, to have initial learning build on itself to create something brand new.   <br /> <br />This book made me think of the unnecessary regimentation which still plagues much of public education. Students should be encouraged (like in the movie \\"Dead Poets Society\\") to do their own dance, to fill their own sails with self-directed discovery.  <br /> <br />Rogers' concept of congruence has a lot to do with what he is talking about here.  The ability to be real in a relationship is much like the teacher being real in accepting the trueneeds of the student.  It is only with empathic listening, not regimentation, with honestly instead of false airs of playing the education game, with a person-centered approach to education and career related goals, not wishes imposed from the outside.....that, I believe, is what he is getting at.  A teacher, he says, \\"must be a person to his students\\", not a faceless embodiment of a cirricular requirement nor a sterile tube through which knowledge is passed from one generation to the next.\\"   <br /> <br />He sums up his feelings about developing optimal climates for student learning, in a person-centered way: <br />\\"If we are to have citizens who can live constructively in this kaleidoscopically changing world, we can only have them if we are willing for them to become self-starting, self-initiating learners. Finally, it has been my purpose to show that this kind of learner develops best, so far as we now know, in a growth- promoting, facilitative, relationship with a person.\\"	2005-03-07

In it Rogers shows really ambitious his person-centered theory is, and how difficult it is to apply.  What it boils down to is that if the world was filled with caring relationships, it would be a much better place to live in.  Through his encounter groups, Rogers meant to explore how wide varieties of people could learn to get along and work through complex problems in their lives.  He goes alittle to far with the free love theories, but as I read the book, especially his final chapter \\"In a Nutshell,\\" I began to realize he was serious about changing the world into a more person-centered place. He was the nuturer in this vast world of conflict and violence.  The power he is referring to here is the power and capacity for human beings to love and appreciate each other during this very short time we have together on this earth.     Another interesting chapter is when he addresses the need for a world government and the abolishing of war. These are quite radical ideas, but he has a point. If we don't have our own houses in order,in a person-centered way, we will not be able to avoid conflict, war, etc, which is based on ignorance.	2005-03-05

She managed to get the breaks in the business that made all the difference.   <br /> <br />Most impressive, I think, is her sincere and passionate letter at the end of the book to her late husband Spencer Tracey, who died back in 1967.  \\"Spence\\" was the one man she loved the most in her life, and she was, till her final years, very puzzled by his character.

There are also ideas on creativity and what the signs of an excellent business(a business running on all cylinders) are.   <br /> <br />     Throughout the book there are helpful quotes from people who have succeeded in the business world, like: Robert Townsend former CEO for Avis, Larry Hohman, founder and chairman of WYNCOM, and Ross Perot, a1992 presidential candidate and chairman of the Perot Group.  There are many others contributing to this book too.  <br /> <br />     Perot said of leadership, \\"Leadership is empowering a group of people to successfully achieve a common goal.  In order to do that, you get to tap their full potential, the motivators are the same things that get you or me excited and cause us to do outstanding work.  That's the most important thing to remember, that most people who are part of the team are very much like he or she is.  A successful leader is one who gives credit where credit is due.\\"       <br /> <br />     Robert Crandall, Chairman and President of American Airlines said, \\"Use leadership to empower others.  Leadership is not about doing it all by yourself, but about involving other people.  You build a sense of teamwork by a participatory process of management.\\"  Former President of the University of California, David Gardner, says: \\"To put one's ego aside, to listen, to do whatever is necessary to achieve the common good in a given situation, is a formidable challenge, but the advantages of the empowering style of leadership are considerable.\\"   <br /> <br />     The former CEO of Avis Corporation, Robert Townsend, says to be a good leader is to be a good problem solver.  He notes five tips for attacking problems most successfully.  <br /> <br />1. Define the problem. <br />2. Gather as much data as you can <br />3. Consider alternate solutions <br />4. Pick the best solution <br />5. Apply the best solution <br /> <br />     Townsend also notes that a proactive leader cannot be good at these steps without initiative.  He states, \\"Initiative is important in the workplace because it shows the manager that you are ready to take on more responsibility and make more important decisions.  If you do it well, it shows that you can learn, take on more responsibilities and know how to properly advise your staff on important issues.\\"    Townsend says a good employee is always looking for more efficient ways to do his/her job.  Having a \\"To Do\\" list to start each day and to start with the most organized as possible work space are excellent ways to start.  <br /> <br />    Executive Peter Drucker is quoted in his book \\"Leader of the Future\\" as saying real leaders do not start out with the question \\"What do I want?\\"...they start out with the question, \\"What needs to be done?\\"   Other good questions to ask are:  \\"What can I do to make a difference?\\" , \\"What are the organization's missions and goals, and am I in line with them?\\"   He also says good managers are extremely tolerant of diversity and are not looking for carbon copies of themselves.   Good bosses are also not afraid of the strength of their associates.  They are concerned about making the right decision, not the popular decision.  Effective leaders are doers, not preachers!  <br /> <br />     Another business executive from a large oil corporation, gives advice on taking initiative in meetings: <br /> <br />1. Really listen to what others have to say. <br />2. Participate in the discussion, but don't dominate it. <br />3. Prepare well for the meeting. <br />4. Speak clearly and loudly with confidence <br />5. Do your part to keep that meeting on target.  Don't let it ramble too much. <br /> <br /> <br />     Workers should ask questions at meetings.  They should come with their concerns, but should bring constructive solutions first.   Managers should be mindful of trying to craft creative solutions with a variety of issues, and shoul be ready to compromise. Managers should, in cooperation with workers always be finding better ways of doing things, and finding ways to save the company money.   <br /> <br /> <br />     Larry Holman, founder and chairman of WYNCOM gives some advice that could apply to leaders or followers in a company: <br /> <br />1. Increase your vocabulary by learning a new word daily. <br />2. Attend professional developmental programs. <br />3. Listen to motivational tapes. <br />4. Be aware of your own strengths and weaknesses. <br />5. Join charitable groups in your community. <br />6. Pick a mentor at work, and bombard him/her with questions.   <br />7. Stay in touch with your creative side.  <br /> <br />        There are also tips on empowerment, releasing the full potential of employees.  It's important for managers to bring out the very best in all their staff.   One executive pointed out that it's not possible to bring out this full potential in workplaces that are \\"punitive\\" where people are \\"risk averse.\\"  Very interesting stuff.   Another CEO talked about the concept of vision.  A clear vision for an organization, she says, \\"unifies and inspires.\\" Employees ideally become self-motivated to be part of the vision.  People produce more when they are self-driven and produce within the context of a \\"powerful vision.\\"  As the old clich goes, \\"There is no I in TEAM.\\"   One more thought about vision.  Thomas Tierney, President of Vitatech International explains it quite eloquently: <br />He says, \\"Visions are born of commitment.  The gestation period of greatness is accelerated by this shared vision; one which uses a spark of future promise to ignite the passions of a population.  These passions establish a collective resonance which is unstoppable.  Stay away from toxic thinkers.\\"  <br />Lawrence Miller, President of Miller Consulting Group says, <br />\\" I think the notion of continuous improvement is a really helpful value.  To achieve that, you need to continually learn and accept continuous change. The first enemy of learning and quality is arrogance. Companies and their executives who think they have reached wisdom close themselves off from further knowledge.  And finally, former Secretary of Labor and Harvard University professor Robert Reich suggests a leader may be one who is not necessarily on top of the totem pole, but who is not afraid to say what needs to be said.\\"     <br /> <br />     These are good words to live and work by!   I enjoyed \\"1001 Ways to Take Initiative at Work\\" and I know you will too.   <br /> <br /> <br />Submitted 2-2005,  Jeff McAndrew,  WHBL Radio <br /> <br />	2005-02-12

Sheldon is definitely the master of \\"What's going to happen next??\\"  The book follows the trials and tribulations of one Dr. Stevens, brilliant psychoanalyst, who is hunted down by ruthless killer, for no apparent reason.  <br />Dr. Stevens is forced the confront the possiblity that he is paranoid, but in the end we see the naked face of evil and find that evil in this case is a more messed up and paranoid face, almost beyond comprehension.   Sheldon's work is anything but dull and predictable, and I highly recommend it.   <br /> <br />Like his latest novel, it's an easy read, but what a great unrelenting rollercoaster ride!  <br /> <br />	2005-02-09

Carson had a knack for getting people to think about what we are doing to the earth in the name of greed and ignorant business interests.  I would hope every high school senior could read this book, so they can reflect on what vehicles, smokestacks, etc. are doing to our precious environment.  How about species still disappearing at an alarming rate and mainstream America seems not to care enough?   <br /> <br />    Carson has many common sense solutions, that would be seriously considered and implemented today, as one reviewer writes:  \\"Many insects have natural enemies that, if introduced into a problem area, will keep down pest populations. Even localized spraying will work better than mass, indiscriminate spraying. Carson argues that biological control methods are increasingly important because insects are building up resistance to pesticides, requiring the creation of even more virulent poisons in a never-ending cycle where nobody wins.\\"   <br /> <br />She was telling people bad news, when most people want to hear good news.  The same goes for today's society.  George Bush is telling people good news, news they want to hear, while people like Howard Dean lost because he wasn't telling the people what they wanted to hear.   Politicians need a lot of courage these days if they want to tell the truth and do what's right on environmental issues and other issues. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-02

I found myself tired of thinking too much reading an Amy Tan book with ten gazillion characters, so I took a break with Sidney and it was worth it.  A lot of imagination in this book \\"Are You Afraid of the Dark\\" and anyone with a high school education can understand it.   <br /> <br />     I liked that I never could quite predict what was going to happen next in this murder mystery.  The good characters are good and the evil characters are very evil.  No gray areas here, but it's kind of fun.  I agree with a recent reviewer who said, \\"fresh scenery and characters, not a deep and thought provoking work of art but rather a pleasant respite from our own mundane worlds. Sheldon, like Stephen J. Cannell, uses his experience in screenplay writing to bring his novels alive, snapping and crackling with energy and tension.\\"   <br /> <br />That says it all.

He admired his uncanny ability to describe everyday experiences of common Americans and make them stand out in a positive way.  Rather talked about how Charles went against the grain of network television, when networks were consciously \\"dumbing down,\\"  Charles was trying to appeal to Americans who had read at least one book per month.  He had faith in the intellectual capacity of citizens and their ability to help democracy.   <br /> <br />This book contains wonderful stories, crafted only in a way Charles could. He saw the everyday heroes in the USA, the heroes who didn't make the headlines, but who mattered a lot in the hearts and minds of many.  Charles was trying to be a bright light in a sometimes dark world, and he succeeded.   <br /> <br />Give this book as a Christmas present to any friend who truly cares about his country and who is tired of the partisanship that is tearing the nation apart.

This book affirmed in my mind that this man is made of the fiber it takes to be president of the United States. George Bush has had four years, and it's time to give someone else a chance. Kerry is a man who will not jump to war, who will be in favor of keeping social security, who will be in favor of concentrating more on domestic issues than world domination.   After reading this book, one gets a sense that soundbites in the news cannot come close to telling the whole story about this man.  He HAS a plan for health care, education, terrorism, the environment and so on.  He very clearly spells out his plans in the book.   <br /> <br />    After seeing him speak live in Sheboygan, Wisconsin last week, I grew more confident that this man is ready to lead a nation and ready to improve relationships between the USA and hundreds of countries around the world.  He very clearly articulates in the book how important the United Nations is and how it must be preserved to bring the world together.   <br /> <br />    If you want to see how bright this man really is, to get beyond the soundbites and the rhetoric, then pick up this very readable book.

Comments like this are from people who totally misunderstand Bill Clinton the person. He is very courageous individual who has gracefully dodged and confronted the arrows of criticism from the extreme right-wing.     Comments like this from his detractors are not helpful:    \\"Oh well, guess Bill's bad childhood gave him the typical liberal excuse to engage in such behavior and then manipulate the circumstances in this self serving tome. The still burning question is: Why is he not in the slammer??? Perhaps this will be answered in My Life, Part 2: The Disgrace and Impeachment Years.\\"    Those who make jokes about Clinton or who enjoy disparaging his character are not people trying to build this nation up, but are obsessed with their own political power or lack of it.      He talks openly in this audio book about his relationship with his wife, with people important in his life and admits that even though he has made mistakes, he believes he has helped the country move forward, and I think he is right.  His themes of inclusion and compassion for the most needy in our society is not something we find among George W Bush's country club friends.   Clinton deeply cares about the country, and he is humble about admitting his mistakes, unlike the current president who has an arrogant chip on his shoulder.     He is very clear about his beliefs on maintaining a strong United Nations, maintaining and not trashing our environment and keeping social security program alive.

The best way to lose weight and get healthier is to exercise and eat in moderation.  This anti-carb stuff is nonsense.  If you exercise regularly, don't snack, and eat the good foods like fresh fruit and vegetables, you won't have to worry about gimmick diets.  Why can't people wake up and smell the coffee? <br /> <br />I don't think people have to give up pasta or anything else that tastes good just so they can follow the latest guru and fad. Eat less, exercise and don't eat if you're depressed.

I agree with this review from a Boston reader:      \\"The sad thing is that he's very talented and passionate radio host, but he'll never influence the mainstream audience because his logical reasoning skills are so poor and so slanted. He won't agree on any foundations to have a fair debate, so the opposition writes him off as a lobotomized partisan.    They're right. Hannity is incapable of changing his mind about anything of substance, and even if he did so he couldn't admit it directly.\\"       In this book he tends to overuse the word evil, to use circular logic, and cannot show any kind of moral clarity because of his strict adherence to the Republican Party.       He may have some points when describing Jimmy Carter's and Neville Chamberlain's ineptitudes, but he fails to admit how conservative foreign policy tends to divide and conquer rather than unite. While the GOP focuses on status and class politics, the democrats aim for unity. Which do you think is more moral, \\"I've got mine\\" or \\"I want to help the less fortunate.\\" ?   I'm afraid Hannity is on the wrong side of the tracks.       Hannity is a very polished radio host who happens to be wrong on many things. If you like to hear him wrap himself up in the US flag and spout propaganda from the Bush administration, then this will be a good read for you.	2004-08-04

Updike is an author I discovered in college, but haven't been seriously reading him since a couple years ago. I devoured &quot;Roger's Version&quot; and his latest short stories, and I didn't know what to expect with the latest Bech book. This is the first of the Bech books I have read. What an amazing book. Updike has a way of describing reality that makes it feel more important..almost surreal.  <br />  <br /> Bech, Updike's alter-ego, runs loose in this one, even resorting to murder of his least liked critics. If you are looking for very DARK humor, here is where to find it. In this pathetic yet somewhat brilliant character, we find some autobiographic hints about Updike himself I'm sure. Some of his dislike of critics is probably projected into Bech's harsh words. And at one point Bech wonders if he is polluting the world with subtle pornography, maybe something the author wonders about from time to time too.  <br />  <br /> Perhaps the best part of the book is the end when Bech gives a rambling but very interesting Nobel Prize acceptance speech in Sweden. This is something only Updike could write. He rambles on about mortality, religion, relationships and birth and death. Vintage Updike. He is a world class writer of the highest order.  <br />  <br />  <br /> Jeffrey McAndrew <br /> author of &quot;Our Brown-Eyed Boy&quot;  <br />  <br />	2004-07-31

This book has so much hope, and exudes respect for human experience. In essence, rituals are spiritual and they are found all the time in the lives we lead.  Until we recognize this we will be less aware of the spiritual magic of being alive each and every day.  Fulghum illuminates this page by page.  He has a very philosophical view of life that is quite contagious.  His presentation style is much like Garrison Keillor in the audiotape of this book I listened to. Soothing, but it jolts us awake with spiritual truths time and time again.

It is obvious that President Carter did thorough research to fill this book full of interesting details about the Revolutionary War Days. One gets a feeling for the viciousness of this period...of the hate of the British and the vast misunderstandings among the people that led to tragic bloodshed. <BR>Through his main character, Ethan Pratt, one sees the good, the bad and the ugly of the period.  I enjoyed most what Ethan through of the confusion around him, and how he dealt with war and family issues.  Character development could have been a little stronger, but it was a great first effort!!  <br />I'm a big Jimmy Carter fan.  He was one of my favorite US presidents, if not my favorite.  I remember during my high school and college years watching Carter on TV and hoping his decisions would turn out to be the right ones.  I was really pulling for him and felt so proud of the efforts he made in the middle east.  Nice guys sometimes finish last, but they can still be good role models.

He was right in so many areas, and his words are prophetic. <br />If the emphasis on pleasure beats out the emphasis on meaning, America will continue to have a very rocky road!<br />Bloom's observations on what is really going on in our campus's is startling and sometimes depressing.  It was stunning to me that many college students are turning away from classical literature.  We need more people like Allan Bloom, to &quot;tell it like it is.&quot; <br />Jeffrey McAndrew<BR>author of &quot;Our Brown-Eyed Boy&quot; and political moderate	2004-05-28

Along with John Updikes's \\"Rabbit Run\\" this is one of the great novels I have ever read. Period. Through the eyes and heart of Charlie Gordon, we see the best and the worst of humanity, we see a person with little resources available to him struggle with enormous challenges. <br />Thanks to a scientific invention that leads to a startling new procedure, Charlie's IQ raises from about 70 to over 300.  It was interesting how getting smarter did not make Charlie any happier.  He was probably happier mopping floors at the bakery than when he was able to understand \\"higher echelons\\" of society.  The message of this book is that the goodness of the human heart can be pure regardless of educational level or intelligence.  <br />I found most interesting how Charlie attempted to understand his earlier life as he gained more reflective abilities and how he attempted to understand his family.  Also interesting...how he<BR>attempted to understand women.  As a lower functioning person, he barely grasped sexual politics if at all.  When he is forced to understand, he still doesn't because he sees the old Charlie in himself no matter how smart he gets.  He sees the old Charlie glaring at him in the mirror.  <br />Even as he starts losing his intelligence because of a procedure that was not perfect, he still has the great desire to retain as much as he can, and to keep reading books, a brilliant way to say through a novel, that learning leads to more learning in life and you can never completely get back to where you were before, but hopefully always moving forward. <br />This, for me, made me more sure of my unconditional positive regard for humanity, especially the potential for learning and love that we all have.  Charlie taught me a lot and I know he will teach you a lot too!(...)	2004-05-25

Updike is a writer who can take average situations and make them surreal.  Harry's angst about his son who is hooked on cocaine, the nature of the car business, and his dull and boring marriage.  While being angry at his son's addiction, Harry is addicted to food and the comfort commercial America promises him.   As the Publisher's Weekly stated, its about the aborted American dream, or is Updike saying something deeper about American, about its meaningless materialism and about the things we value.  This was the best of the Rabbit series.  The writing about Harry's slow personal disintegration can be painful to read about, but even more painful, finding some parallels between my life and Harry's.  <br />Reading Updike is like entering a colorful dream world which also urges the soul to consider some grim realities. <br />Jeffrey McAndrew<BR>author of &quot;Our Brown Eyed Boy&quot;<br />p.s. Another Updike book I would recommend:  &quot;Roger's Version&quot;	2004-05-01

It was almost like having an insider's view of what psychiatrists think, the thought processes they go through when deciding what techniques to use with patients.  This book takes patience, but if you have the patience to re-wind or re-read, it is highly worth it.  It was interesting to hear him talk about directive vs. non-directive approaches to therapy and when each is most applicable. I would have liked to see him include more examples of couples with children having problems.  It seemed like a lot of his examples included childless couples.  Also, a lot of his examples included those high on the socio-economic scale, which may turn off Johnny Lunchbox and Susie Middleclass.  <br />I wish he would have included more about Rogerian therapy, and it's non-directive nature.  I also would have found some more references to religion interesting.  All in all...it was a good book.  A lot of thought went into the work, and I can certainly tell Dr. Kramer majored in English in college.   Perhaps he would be better at writing fiction..just a thought.<br />Jeffrey McAndrew<BR>author of &quot;Our Brown-Eyed Boy&quot;	2004-05-01

Truman represented the opposite of the arrogance that pervades today's White House.  He was a common man from Independence, Missouri who rose to greatness.  He was one of us, not talking to us from &quot;on high.&quot;  He loved his country, and it was obvious from reading the book that his common sense approach to leadership was admired deeply by ones who followed him.  <br />America may never see someone like Truman again.

I like his emphasis on seeking spiritual solutions to problems instead of material solutions to problems.  It's not what we have on this earth that matters most, but the wealth of spiritual growth we generate during our lifetimes. He is also right on the mark when he talks of the connectiveness of all life, and for us to recognize this brings on a totally new awareness. As human beings we are all brothers and sisters, and the sooner we realize this, the sooner we will avoid the destruction that war will bring.<br />The only negative thing, some of his ideas seem to be presented in a non-scientific way.

If, as a nation we take care of our children, we will be able to start to clean up our culture. In the book, Clinton talks openly about the vulgarity on TV and in the movies and says more regulation and awareness is needed in the area. She says the government must be involved, which hard core republicans may disagree with, but <BR>she also stresses (in so many words) that the government is us, and we must take responsibility for the children that we raise..some on an unhealthy diet of junk food, PlayStation and All Star Wrestling. <BR>She also is strong in her opinion about changes needed in the Family Medical Leave Act.

This book was very well written and looked closely at <BR>the life of a complex and very thoughtful founding father. <BR>It was great to hear about John and Abigail's wonderful relationship.  It was interesting to read about the stress Adams felt as he was caught between his commitment to his country and his obvious dedication to family and to his generous and loving wife.

This book is something you might have gotten to read if Tom Clancy had been a liberal.<br />A mole assassin is left stranded in deep cover by the end of the Cold War. He goes into business for himself and is ultimately hired by the military-industrial complex to shoot down a passenger jet and blame it on the Palestinians. The real object of the exercise is to get America to deploy a missile defense system and re-elect a right wing President.<br />A resourceful CIA analyst is thrown into the fray and disrupts the bad guys' plans after a lot of good people (including his own wife) have been killed, wounded or otherwise put in harm's way.<BR>If this sounds familiar, it should. It is a variation of the plot of Clancy's Patriot Games, brought out of Ireland and set on the post 9/11 international stage.<br />Silva did much better with The English Assassin. This is basic fluff.	2004-02-12

Having discovered Silva's writing through \\"The Dead Artist\\" and \\"The English Assassin,\\" I've come to expect subtlety and nuance, with sympathetic characters.  Silva is one of my new favorite authors.<br />Going back to read \\"The Mark of the Assassin,\\" for me, was a disappointment.  While Silva's concepts and characters match those of his later books, he seems less focused here.  We watch political maneuverings, clandestine meetings, brutal attacks, yet never really doubt what's going on.  We see little of the main characters within the first hundred pages, and when Michael Osbourne and his wife do take center stage, they are puppets in a less than credible play.<br />The writing is fine.  Dialogue moves along.  But the improbabilities and coincidences begin to mount quickly.  Even as the pace picks up in the last quarter of the book, I found myself doubting the scenes.  One example: the KGB trained, world-renowned assassin moves in for the kill by taking the disguise of a bicycle courier(even getting multiple piercings to look the part), but as soon as our erstwhile hero sees him from a distance, the cover is blown.  Ah, too bad--all that effort for nothing.<br />For a fast-paced story and streamlined writing, \\"The Mark of the Assassin\\" surpasses many second-rate novels.  Clearly, though, with only his second book, Silva was fine-tuning his storytelling, and I had a difficult time getting lost in this tale.  Having been spoiled by his newer, richer work, I finished this one with barely a mark.	2003-06-24

The book is filled with vulgar language -- and I assume that the reason was to make the characters sound tough. What happened to showing a tough character rather than telling his threats in language that loses its force by overuse? \\"F\\" this, and \\"F\\" that, and \\"F\\" everything else becomes a cliche' within a couple of chapters.<br />I generally read a book in a day or two, but the convoluted pathways made this one tedius and time consuming. Frequently, I set it aside to watch TV. <br />I was very disappointed because the author did not identify the Director. A sequel is great, but to lead someone through a complicated story, and not answer the most significant question, is not. <br />Perhaps he reveals the identity of the Director in his next book.

An American jetliner is shot down from the sky off of Long Island by a hand held Stinger missile by a two man team in a small boat, killing all aboard.  The boat is discovered to be the tomb of a dead Palestinian terrorist with links to the militant group the Sword of Gaza.  He had been shot 3 times in the face, the signature of premier assassin Jean Paul Delaroche, known as October.<br />The attack had been orchestrated by a group called the Society, a clandestine group of wealthy businessmen, intelligence experts, career military men and criminals.  The goal of the Society was the maximizing of profit by promoting world chaos.  Mitchell Elliott, multi millionaire industrialist and owner of Alarton Defense Systems was a prominent member.  Through years of political contributions, Elliott was able to control policy decisions of America president James Beckwith.  Elliott now stood to make a fortune by supplying the nation with a missile defense system.<br />Michael Osbourne, top CIA agent and Middle East terrorism expert is called in to investigate the tragedy.  Osbourne, now married to beautiful and high powered lawyer Elizabeth Cannon, years ago, witnessed the killing of his girlfriend Sarah by Delaroche.<br />Osbourne suspecting that the Sword of Gaza was not involved in the plot, starts to investigate Elliott and Delaroche.

Then, there's your money-grubbing conspiracy to rule the world using terrorism, extortion, etc. Does this sound at all like SPECTRE from the old James Bond movies? Perhaps the author should have considered making an original plot instead of trying to make just another lackluster spy novel. In conclusion, if you want a good suspense novel, stick to the works of Frederick Forsyth or John Le Carre.	2002-06-29

Enter Michael Osbourne, a senior CIA \\"case worker\\" (the preferred term for \\"spy\\").. Osbourne recognizes the assassin's mark as that of the man who killed his former lover and many high profile political figures.  As he gets closer and closer to finding the killer's identity, Osbourne becomes more entangled in the assassin's web, and unknowingly, places his life, and that of his entire family`s on the line.<br />Silva masterfully includes all the cookie cutter elements that genre fans want in a really good read: a solid (and very visual) education of international locales,  inside details of covert activities, rapid pace story telling, masterful plotting, lots of chasing, twisting and turning...but he adds something even more spectacular: a romantic undercurrent that humanizes the roles of the protagonist AND antagonist.  Silva beautifully weaves in two riveting love stories right under the surface of the main plot.<br />I have a couple of pet peeves (Elizabeth's whining throughout the first half of the book was particulary annoying) but they were immediately squashed as I raced throughout the night toward the last page.<br />If you enjoy fast-paced spy thrillers that take you on a whirlwind of espionage action all around the globe, then this is the book for you.

While that was a fictionalized account of how the Allies deceived Hitler as to the location of the D Day landing, this is pure  fiction. Or is it? A CIA operative who has a strong moral code and a highly  competent professional assassin who serves a secret group made up of the  worlds movers and shakers are destined throughout the pages of the book to  end up in a confrontation that ends up raising more questions than it  settles. Entertaining writing, fast paced action, believable characters and  enough allusion to actual people or events to keep you wondering where the  fiction blends with the present day.

The geography is accurate, the  dialogue is witty and crisp, and the vocabulary is educational.

Then for the villain to jump in a Range Rover with snow-shoes and  dehydrated food? Where's the road? Who lit the flares? The Innuit? How did  the vehicle get there? And get out?

But it's not nearly as good as &quot;The Unlikely Spy,&quot; which was brimming with character and a real  sense of place.  What disappointed me most about &quot;Mark of the  Assassin&quot; is that Silva is touted as having intimate knowledge through  his previous work in journalism with the subject he writes about.  Yet his  grasp of life in wartime London 50 years ago was much more gripping than  this one.  Maybe that says more about today's life inside the Beltway than  Silva's writing style!  I'll hope for a return to his premier form in the  next novel.	1998-12-22

I haven't read that book, so I won't go into comaparisons, but, viewed on its own merits, The Mark of  the Assassin is a decent book, that probably should have been a lot better.  The characters are exactly the sort of people you'd expect to inhabit this  sort of book; the right-thinking CIA operative, his smart, tough attorney  wife, the rumpled CIA spymaster, the slightly dotty, sixtysomething  Republican President (who reminded me of a similar character in the movie  Clear and Present Danger, the manipulative White House Chief of Staff, the  shadowy, Christian conservative defense contractor, and on and on and on...  no surprises there. Silva's  writing style, though, is clean and economical; it reminded me of Frederick  Forsyth.  And he does come up with one memorable character: international  assassin Jean-Paul Delaroche, code name &quot;October&quot;.  I didn't buy  his techniques all of the time, but his motivations and character quirks  were never less than convincing.  All told, an unspectacular second effort.	1998-12-01

I must say, though, that despite the incredibility of the plot and the cardboard characters, his ability to describe places and to build atmosphere came through brilliantly from time to time.

The problem of this novel is that the author did not get a tight grip of  everything, wasted lot of pages on describing the relationship of Michael  Osbourne and his wife; the President was sufferig a low rating in the poll  and not popular(what a repetive bore). Besides, the alocations of the  whereabouts were also quite stereotyped. Why a  terrorist group would  always send a fax first to a guy worked in Times, London, and then it had  to be passed along again to MI5, and then, inevitably repeatively passed  along to CIA?  Don't understand why should we have to read so many  tasteless yet so detailed blabblahblah, man? This book and its author just  gave me an impression of the mixtured wannabe of F. Forsyth(The Icon) and  J. Archer(The 11th Commandment)--only regretfully worse--and my, my, my,  these three books are so alike. The other problem of this book is that the  author has used lot of straight-ahead sentences almost in every page but  failed to be improved by his editors, making the read even more tiresome  and bored. For instance, the last paragraph on P.72, only the first  sentence sounded quite promising, &quot;The President looked very  exhausted.&quot; Then, all of the following sentences begun with a &quot;He  had..., he had..., he turned..., he had...&quot; There is no way to call  this novel a thriller since it was so loose, forcing me to read it like a  3rd-party moron chewing a candle off, then spitting out the tasteless  tidbits hopelessly.	1998-08-15

This second effort was not quite as good, but well worth reading.  The element that made _The_Unlikely_Spy_ so enthralling is fundamentally missing here: the historical context.  Since _Mark_of_the_Assassin_ is set in modern times, there is no equivalent here to the depiction of wartime London.<br />However Silva does have a knack for transporting the reader, in this case geographically rather than temporally. His settings in France, England and the US genuinely make you feel like you are there.	1998-05-30

Not only is this NOT as good as &quot;The Unlikely Spy,&quot; Silva proves himself to be yet another politically motivated author who uses the celebrity status gained from a past book to advance his political agenda.  Just look at the cast of characters:  There's the President's manipulative chief of staff (just like Ronald Regan's Don Regan); there's the telegenic dimwitted Republican President who is the puppet and tool of the manipulative chief of staff (just as Ronald Reagan was portrayed); there's the evil First Lady who is controlling things behind the scenes (a la Nancy Reagan); there's the all-knowing media on the side of &quot;good&quot; versus &quot;evil&quot; (the Washington Post); and, of course, there's big business which is up to its collective eyeballs in &quot;evil&quot; because it wants to build and profit from a space shield (i.e., a not-so-subtle reference to Reagan's Star Wars).  There's even a pair of terrorist killers who are portrayed as two nice people who are in love, victims of terrible childhoods.  And, well, you get the idea.  There's even a &quot;Vince Foster Suicide.&quot;  One of the immediate tipoffs to Silva's political views comes in his statements that (paraphrase) the previous Administration had a Cabinet as diverse as America yet this Administration had chosen Cabinet members solely from the Good Old White Boys Club. This transparant reference is to Clinton vs. Any Republican President.  On top of this, the plot is tedious, predictable, and SLOW.  You want to scream out on page 100, &quot;Yo, Dan-O, we've got this figured out already.  Enough.  Just get on with it, will you?&quot;  Yet, despite all these problems, Silva has promise.  I'm looking for a return to the style he set in his first effort, &quot;The Unlikely Spy.&quot;  As for this one, save your money.	1998-05-27

It was like the author either stoped caring or he didn't know where to go with it. I was highly disappointed in this novel.	1998-04-20

Anyone who has read the synopsis (or the book) can tell right away that it is without a doubt based on the crash of flight 800 off Long Island. (And you know what controversy there was/is over what caused that crash). Well, that real life tragedy is the obvious source of this fictional story. And it is used well. &quot;Assassin&quot; is one of the best thrillers I've read since THE SHAPE by Craig Furnas (also listed on Amazon.com). Get &quot;Assassin&quot; for your summer read. Read it by the pool. Read it on the beach. But don't read it on an airplane!!!	1998-04-17

This book has a lot of suspense that kept me turning the pages. The ending, however, surprised me. Osbourne and Delaroche are by far the best and most interesting characters in the book. Although, Astrid Vogel is a nice addition to this good thriller. Overall, this book is one of the best assasin books I've read in my life. I am about to read the &quot;The Unlikely Spy&quot; to see if it is as good as this book. For readers who like action or assasin books, you will love this book.	1998-04-11

True, it lacks a few of the things-like the character development-that made &quot;Unlikely Spy&quot; an INCREDIBLE book, but I still rate it better than 90% of its' genre. If you liked Daniel Silva's 1st book, I think you'll find equal enjoyment here....I did!!!	1998-03-18

The Mark Of The Assassin (originally to be titled The Society) is an exciting, fast-moving thriller that is well-worth reading. It has it all...interesting characters, good plot and sub-plots, lots of action and some good surprises.  Silva can expect another bestseller when this book goes on-sale in March (possibly April); however, it is not without some minor flaws, such as occasional weak dialogue and a few secondary characters which could have been developed more. I think you'll be able to easily  overlook these flaws.<br /><br />The Mark Of The Assassin is a very good second effort by Silva, but it is not as good as his previous thriller, The Unlikely Spy (which is now out in paperback). Enjoy!	1998-03-03
