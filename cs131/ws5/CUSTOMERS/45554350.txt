The first story featured a murder mystery within the animation industry (Michael Joens has past week in the animation field.) and in this novel, the plot revolves around people involved in horse-racing and breeding.<br /><br />Our heroine, Sandra Cameron is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder from the events of the past story. She's having nightmares as well as breakdowns and although her relationship with Tom Rigby, as well the kitten Sylvie he gave to her, have helped, she's still pretty messed up. Things only seem to go from bad to worse when the murder case in this novel, of horse trainer  Chet Gundry, ends up involving both her and her father as potential suspects.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, there are more deaths and more potential suspects as well. The web grows quite complicated and the strain takes its toll on both Sandra and Tom. It'll keep you guessing right up to the end.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy \\"Blood Reins\\" quite as much as \\"An Animated Death in Burbank,\\" but overall it was still a great story. It's probably just because I have an interest in animation, but don't really care much about horses. Still, if you enjoyed the first book in the series, you'll probably like this one. And I'm definitely looking forward to the next installment in the series.	2005-10-11

Of course, the movies only give us a limited insight into this character, leaving the novelizations to fill in the gaps.<br /><br />Enter \\"Shatterpoint.\\" A novel based during the time of the Clone Wars (between \\"Star Wars: Attack of the Clones\\" and \\"Star Wars: Revenge of The Sith), \\"Shatterpoint\\" focuses on the story of Mace Windu, sent to his home planet, Haruun Kal (containing a native race of untrained Force users), in order to seek out his apprentice, Depa Bilaba. Actually, he isn't sent, so much as volunteers, for an important reason --- Depa is a master of Vaapad, a special Jedi combat art that only one other Jedi has mastered - Mace himself.<br /><br />Mace is drawn in by Depa's disturbing message --- that \\"there is nothing more dangerous than a Jedi who's finally gone sane.\\" He heads for Haruun Kal and is soon caught up in a very surprising ambush. He is forced to adventure through an unforgiving jungle (though the natives would deny that the jungle has any personality at all) and comes face-to-face with the harsh realities of war.<br /><br />Much of the story is told through Mace Windu's personal journal, in which we get his personal accounts of his feelings and actions. Recorded for the Jedi Archive, this journal is sealed so that once it's recorded it can't be altered, such that Mace can't go back and try to make it look better. These are some of the deepest moments of the book as Mace sorts out his feelings and confronts the terrible situations he's forced to deal with.<br /><br />If you've never picked up any \\"Star Wars\\" novel before, try \\"Shatterpoint.\\" If you've read Matthew Stover's works before and are thirsty for me, definitely get \\"Shatterpoint.\\" And if you're looking to learn more about Mace Windu, \\"Shatterpoint\\" is definitely the right book to choose.	2005-09-24

In this book, \\"Things Not Seen,\\" he takes a departure from that path for a unique and moving story about a boy who wakes up, takes a shower and finds that he's gone completely invisible.<br /><br />This story has a fantastic premise, but it also has a deep feeling of realness. You may have fantasized about being invisible, but what if you didn't know to make it stop and had to deal with it all the time? The boy, Bobby, in this story, confronts this situation --- he can no longer go to school, he's afraid of being found and studied by the government and he can't even go out and hang with his friends. As he begins to deal with the realities of his new life, he finds himself doing and thinking things he never would have thought of before. And when his parents are hurt in a car crash, he's left alone at home and has to start fending for himself.<br /><br />As Bobby ventures out, he meets a friend --- someone with whom he can share his experiences and open up to as he's never to anyone before. I won't spoil for you just how this happens, you'll have to read this and find out for yourself.	2005-09-21

He wakes up one morning and his family finds that it's simply not on his face. They (his father, mother, older sister and little sister) go on a hunt through the house leading all the way out into the backyard for it, but it doesn't seem to be anywhere. It's not in the laundry basket and he definitely didn't wash it off wish his washcloth, or wipe it off with his towel.<br /><br />Readers will by able to search along with Sammy as they flip large flaps throughout the book, revealing the contents of the various places that Sammy's family searches for his smile. And younger readers will smile their own smiles of delight as they discover just where Sammy's smile happens to be.<br /><br />This story has words, but for the most part, the pictures tell the tale. Each page is illustrated in full. The illustrations, by Katy Bratun, are brightly colored and rich with detail.	2005-09-20

It was a good choice, as this is another superb \\"Star Wars\\" story by this author.<br /><br />\\"Star Wars The New Jedi Order: Traitor\\" focuses on the story of Jacen Solo and Vergere --- his tormentor, or perhaps his eventual savior. Jacen's first experiences with Vergere certainly don't seem very positive. She sticks him in a torture device called the Embrace of Pain and then takes away his ability to use the Force. He's then thrust into many new situation, with Vergere there the whole way, although it soon becomes clear that her agenda is much deeper than he may have originally thought.<br /><br />\\"Traitor\\" is a powerful tale of Jacen Solo's journey as everything, or at least many things he knew, change all around him. A major power, the Yuuzhang Vong, wants to convert him to one of their followers, but that may not be as easy as they thought. Just how things turn out for Solo is something you'll have to find out for yourself.<br /><br />Based on this book, I'll probably at least give a look at the other \\"New Jedi Order\\" books from the top. This tale, however, is definitely a hard act to top.	2005-09-17

This one is another in this great line.<br /><br />\\"Lunch Money\\" focuses on Greg Kenton, a boy who is only in the sixth grade, but is already hard at work on planning a business empire. Although he enjoys many normal-kid activities, he's already working hard --- raking leaves, shoveling snow, doing extra chores for cash and various other activities. His first ever bank deposit was $3,200 and then he decided that school would be a great place to make money. His attempts at selling candy and toys were shut down by the principal, but he has a new idea that he's sure will work --- Chunky Comics --- miniature comic books, hand-drawn, mass-produced and sold for a quarter each. It's a great idea, but problems soon crop up:<br /><br />- His long-time rival --- Maura Shaw --- steps in with a plan of her one<br /><br />- The administration, of course, eventually catches wind of Greg's plan, once again throwing a wrench in the works.<br /><br />So what follows is a tale of two rivals finding out things they never knew about each other and thoughtful questions about school policies, courage, hard work and what's truly important in life.<br /><br />Like all Andrew Clements novels, this story is extremely well written and easy to follow. The characters are identifiable and believeable --- the other most major character in the story being the math teacher named Mr Zenotopoulous, known to most simply as Mr. Z. Mr. Z. fears the sight of blood and has a long history of avoiding conflict because of this, but he ends up finding himself more involved in the situation that develops with Greg, Maura and the comics than he ever would have thought possible. In this, Clements once again shows his knack for helping his readers to see things not just from the students' points-of-view, but from the teachers' as well.	2005-09-16

For those who have read \\"Knight Life,\\" \\"One Knight Only\\" will definitely come as something of a surprise. It's a much more serious novel for perhaps much more serious times. That's not to say that there isn't still much of the same sort of humor that readers have seen in \\"Knight Life\\" and other Peter David stories, but on the whole, this is a much more weighty book.<br /><br />I'll admit, it took me a while to get used to the more serious tone of this story, but once I did, it turned out to really be pretty good. In the original \\"Knight Life,\\" Arthur Penn became mayor of New York. In this story, he's since moved up in the political arena --- way up --- and has now become President of the United States. It's been quite a journey and there have been losses along the way too --- Merlin, for one, turned to stone by Miss Basil, whom he was no longer able to control. Arthur is also now faced with the growing threat of top terrorist leader Arnim Sandoval, who will soon make things personal. But all of this may be nothing compared to the very legendary individual that Arthur will soon be facing.<br /><br />If you liked \\"Knight Life,\\" I'd say give \\"One Knight Only\\" a try. It may not quite match the amazing standard of writing set by Peter David in that first story, but it's still good.	2005-09-06

This large, colorful picture book is a faithful retelling of \\"The Book of Beasts,\\" one of many stories originally found in \\"The Book of Dragons,\\" written by E. Nesbit over one hundred years ago. In this story, a young boy named Lionel is, to his great surprise, crowned king after the death of his great-great-great-great-great grandfather. His grandfather was said by some to be a magician and sure enough, he finds in the royal library a book called \\"The Book of Beasts.\\" He lets out of it some wonderful creatures, such as a butterfly \\"all red, and brown, and yellow, and blue,\\" but then he ends up setting a dragon loose upon the kingdom. It's an upsetting start to his days as king, but eventually young Lionel vows to set things right.<br /><br />The story is abridged (but done very well) and fully illustrated in ink, oil pastels and oils by Inga Moore. The illustrations are beautiful and fanciful, many covering entire pages and others woven into the text. Fantasy fans of all ages will enjoy this story and may be inspired to take a look at \\"The Book of Dragons,\\" if they haven't already.	2005-09-06

Well --- that's not quite right, rather the girl Natalie Nelson (pen-name Cassandra Day) is encouraged to publish the story by her friend, Zoe Riceman (a.k.a. \\"Zee Zee.\\") Andrew Clements describes the girls' friendship as \\"push-and-pull\\" Natalie has always been a writer, while Zoe is a talker. Further, Zoe is the daughter of an attorney and could possibly be one herself, she's been winning arguments ever since she could talk. At first, Natalie doesn't want to publish her novel, not sure it would succeed, but is slowly brought around to the idea by Zoe.<br /><br />What follows is a hilarious, but also touching tale of the ins-and-outs of publishing, friendship, and good, hard-work. Readers will laugh at some of the riotous schemes in the book and cheer as progress is made. And they will also find things to relate to in the tale of a daughter, her widowed mother (and editor) and a girls' memories of her father.	2005-08-28

In this original \\"Dragon Tales\\" book, Max and Emmy are playing a game of hide-and-seek, but can't seem to find a good hiding spot from Zak and Wheezie. Zak and Wheezie of course have a big advantage --- having to heads makes things a lot easier when it comes to seeking.<br /><br />Determined to gain a leg-up, Emmy decides to hide in the Forest of Darkness and convinces Max to come along as well. It's a great hiding place and Max and Emmy wait a long time with nobody finding them. But then they start to get scared when they give up the game, but can't find their way out.

I saw \\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\\" and wasn't wowed by it, but I thought it was a decent, enjoyable movie. After seeing some of the acclaim for the novelization, however, I decided to definitely give it a read --- I love movie novelizations.<br /><br />Although I know of course it couldn't be possible, I do call this the book on which the movie should have been based. This is a thrilling and compelling adaptation of the true final saga in the \\"Star Wars\\" series. Matthew Stover gets right into the heart of the story and the characters. Throughout the book, you'll find his compelling and detailed descriptions of the characters --- their emotions, their place in the story at that time, their relations with others and much more.<br /><br />The action scenes are great, but this book is at its best in the depictions of the characters and the relations. You'll learn many things you never knew or never picked up on before about Darth Sidious, Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi and many of the other characters you've come to know through Episodes I-III (and in Kenobi's [and I suppose Anakin's] case, the other Episodes as well.) Matthew Stover writes about these characters with such depth that one would almost believe, if they didn't know better, that he created them. You'll relive all the drama, the highs and lows of the movie and feel more satisfied with the plot than you ever were before.<br /><br />I'd even go so far as too say that even someone who's never been a fan of \\"Star Wars\\" before could enjoy this novelization. As for myself, I'll definitely be seeking more of Matthew Stover's work.<br /><br />Edit --- Audiobook on CD Review<br /><br />Hmm, apparently you're only allowed one review per \\"set,\\" so now I'm adding in my review for the audibook version on CD as of November 6, 2005:<br /><br />Wow, and I Thought the Written *Book* Was Great<br /><br />This is the audiobook adaptation of Matthew Stover's version of \\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\\" on CD.

However, following up on the great example set by the book, the people at Books on Tape who put this together have gone the extra mile. There's stuff on here I never expected --- musical scores from the movie, sound effects including light-saber humming and astromech whistling, full surround sound and other audio elements for a truly immersive experience. Pretty much all audiobooks I've heard before have been pretty much just a straight read-out-loud, with maybe some music at the beginning and end.

He's kind of worried at first, but some assurances from Blue and our friend Joe persuade him to give it a try. Once he's there, he realizes they do a lot of the same things he already likes to do and decides that school is, well... cool.<br /><br />This is a story that parents may have to read to their kids, or they can just enjoy looking at the pictures. Each page is fully and brightly illustrated and Joe himself is included in the book, probably through much the same process used to edit him onto the animated TV show. This book also includes many of Blue's other school-friends, including Magenta, Green Puppy and Orange Kitten.<br /><br />This book is a nice change of pace from the television story on which it's based. The problem with the television story was that it tried to cram the events of an entire school day into like ten minutes --- a rushed pace that seems like it would probably cause kids starting school some worry. This book also covers an entire school day, but since you're reading and enjoying the pictures instead of watching, it doesn't have the same feel. I'd say in this case, the book definitely triumphs.	2005-02-11

In it, the legend of King Arthur is turned on his head as Arthur, Merlin and other characters from the time arrive after ten centuries of hiding into the modern craziness of the twentieth century. Once there, Arthur hopes to regain the fame and power he once had, but he'll have to do something he's not used to --- starting relatively small. Thus does Arthur Penn's (Pendragon's) campaign for mayor begin. However, he'll have to face many old foes from the past, as well as the opposing candidates for mayor --- the second being something not nearly as much to worry about as one would think.<br /><br />\\"Knight Life\\" is full of Peter David's typical off-beat humor and is a wonderful first offering from him. This version is an updated version of the original release, offering Peter David's improvements to an already great story.<br /><br />I'm not completely familiar with the Arthurian legend, but still found it quite easy to get into this book. Sure, some hardcore fans may find things to nitpick, but overall I thought this was a really great read and it's also made me curious to check out more of the legend.

Like all the books in this set, this book features bright, attractive full page illustrations and an engaging story. Also included on the back is a fun Mad Libs game for kids to play --- although you'll probably wanna make a copy or write it down, rather than writing on the book itself.<br /><br />The plot is this: Mr. and Mrs. Read are going out and Arthur and D.W. are curious as to just who their babysitter will be. Mom and Dad think Arthur and D.W. will like a surprise, but as kids will do, Arthur and D.W. think of the worst. They're soon spinning fantasies that the babysitter could be anything from a robot to even Arthur's strict teacher, Mr. Ratburn. (A scenario that seems to appeal only to Baby Kate --- in the fantasy, D.W.'s dozing and Arthur's barely awake, while Baby Kate is scribbling at the bottom of a whiteboard, having apparently just done some advanced algebra!) Can any of these aweful scenarios be as bad as reality?<br /><br />So who's the mystery babysitter? Well, if you're at least somewhat familiar with the series, then you'll probably be able to guess just from the profile with a question mark on the front cover. If not, then prepare to be surprised just like Arthur and D.W.	2005-01-23

In \\"Garfield's Guide to Everything,\\" Garfield dishes out advice on many topics near and dear to his heart and rants on some not so dear. In here, you'll find advice on everything from laziness to pscychics. There's actually a lot of good information in here and it's all done with the Garfield wit and humor you've come to love. Watch also for funny, up-to-date pop-culture references.<br /><br />Included with the advice are everything from Garfield cartoons to Garfield promotional posters. While they may seem like shameless advertising (and hey --- why would Garfield be above that?), they actually help quite nicely to reinforce the points that Garfield is making. Watch out though, you might find yourself wanting one or more of these posters if you don't have them already!<br /><br />At the end of the book, Garfield gives a hodepodge of short, additional bits of advice on subjects that didn't merit full-page entries, such as armageddon and procrastination. Make sure to soak up this information, followed by a big dinner and then a nice, long snooze. All day perhaps?	2005-01-09

Having hidden the fact that she's a genius all of her life, she feels that grades on report cards aren't a good measure of a student. She decides to do something about it by getting all Ds (and one C, to her disappointment) on her own report card.<br /><br />Things seem to be going the right way at first, but even a genius can't anticipate everything. It's not long before the situation becomes out-of-control, but fortunately there are those willing to help.<br /><br />While it's possible this book might have a negative effect on some children, I don't think it's really suggesting that anyone hide their genius. If anything, it's simply suggesting that child geniuses can do great things, but at the same time, they need some time of their own to simply be like ordinary kids. That, and the action this book can inspire about the matter of grades, means that it gives two (and possibly more) great messages.<br /><br />The character portrayals seem reasonably accurate. Well-rounded characters are important, but it's also important to remember too that there are parents and other adults out there who can be rather close-minded, and don't take the time to actually get to know what's going on in the life of their child as well as they should. (Without being unnecessarily prying and intrusive, of course)	2005-01-08

Irritated at this childish behavior and upset because his position will soon be eliminated, the instructor decides he's had enough. When very little disciplinary action is taken against the student, he lays down a challenge --- organizing the upcoming holiday concert will be all up to the students and he's stepping out of the matter entirely.<br /><br />The boy who flung the rubber bands quickly takes charge, feeling that he could manage things much better than what the teacher had been doing. He soon finds that matters aren't as simple as he thought and that without guidance, things are getting out of control. But with help, he and the class find themselves on the way to a holiday concert that will be one everyone in attendance will remember.<br /><br />Those who have read many of Clement's past works will find that things go rather differently in this one than in some of his other stories. That's good thing and the ending of this book leaves a lot to think about.	2005-01-08

The plot is distilled to its most basic elements, with all references to the villain plot and the more complex elements of the story removed.<br /><br />The basic plot is that after an accident, Funshine Bear and Grumpy Bear have a disagreement when Grumpy feels that Funshine doesn't take anything seriously. Funshine is worried by this pronouncement and decides to leave Care-A-Lot for someplace where he can crack jokes without hurting anyone's feelings. He ends up becoming King of Joke-A-Lot, but his friends all miss him and want him back.<br /><br />This will probably be a good read for any young kid who is just starting to read.

I'm not a trekker or a trekkie, but I enjoy watching the shows and reading the novelizations. \\"Voyager\\" was probably my favorite installment of the show and up until now, I've very much enjoyed Golden's novelizations of the continuation of the story.<br /><br />\\"Spirit Walk: Old Wounds\\" mainly focuses on Chakotay, who is now Captain of the Starship Voyager and his new crew. While there are a lot of interesting ideas set up, the book focuses far too much on middling interpersonal issues and conflicts. Basically, this a book where for large stretches of time, nothing very interesting happens and then you get something that's only somewhat exciting. Although some time is spent with Janeway, The Doctor, Paris and Torres, I really feel that these best characters of the series are largely ignored, particularly the show's standout - Captain Janeway. She's turned into some big-time Admiral who is off running diplomatic missions and doesn't seem to have that old spark. Did I mention that Commander Tuvok is entirely absent from the story, save only a passing mention?<br /><br />I'd say that \\"Spirit Walk: Old Wounds\\" did just enough to keep my interest to make me want to continue reading Christie Golden's novelizations of the continuation of \\"Voyager.\\" I'm really looking forward to the next edition becuase if Golden properly pays off what was set up in \\"Old Wounds,\\" then \\"Enemy of My Enemy\\" should be a very good book. I just really hope that the format for this next book is a lot different because if not, I will quit about halfway through, like I felt like doing with \\"Spirit Walk.\\"	2004-12-15

Following their honeymoon, they're invited to meet the parents, but Shrek has misgivings from the beginning. Most of the characters from the first movie return and also joining the cast are Prince Charming, Puss in Boots, the King and Queen and the Fairy Godmother.<br /><br />This movie novel is basically \\"Shrek 2\\" with most of the naughty bits removed, such that is this were the version released in theaters, it would probably be rated G. Most of the songs and many of the pop-culture references are gone too, although luckily at least a portion of the \\"Fairy Godmother Song\\" is included.<br /><br />That said, this is actually a pretty good novelization. It stays true to the plot, but also adds in a couple new gags that don't change the story, but are still quite funny. If you like reading novelizations of movies, then you'll probably like this one. The only disappointing thing about this one is that the bonus ending (those who have seen the movie know what I mean) is completely cut.	2004-12-14

Books	5	4	9	N	N	Sing it Stossel	In this audiobook, John Stossel masterfully reads his work \\"Give Me a Break,\\" the title being based on his series of segments for the ABC newsmagazine \\"20/20.\\" However, there's so much gospel truth in this book that he could sing it if he wanted to. Well, okay, not gospel truth, and Stossel isn't perfect, but at least he's willing to say what he really feels and doesn't kowtow to anybody. He also seems to be willing to acknowledge his mistakes if someone can give him a good argument if he's wrong. He doesn't suffer from what he calls \\"the conceit of the anointed.\\"<br /><br />The book begins with Stossel's personal journey --- overcoming stuttering and breaking into news and consumer reporting. I learned some things I was previously only vaguely aware of about Stossel --- mainly his past in consumer reporting before deciding to go after government fraud. He explains the various situations and people he's dealt with, presenting amazing evidence of supreme illogic and stubbornness of some of government's and corruption's most hardened defenders. Included in this audiobook version are actual clips from these segments so you can hear it for yourself.<br /><br />One of the best parts of this book is when Stossel talks about a time he confronted a third-world dictator. He explains that the segment is available for schools and says that he got letters back saying that he shouldn't have been so rude to this dictator. His response: that he's runing lifes and *somebody* ought to be rude to him. I couldn't agree more and thank goodness Stossel comes from a country that at least somewhat protects those freedoms.<br /><br />If you've just been reading the main media blah blah blah, then prepare to have your eyes opened. Or, if you don't want to open them, they'll be forced open, assuming you actually pay attention.	2004-12-07

That's certainly an understatement. If there's any justice, this book will be remembered forever and will be a staple of school cirriculums.<br /><br />In \\"Frindle,\\" a boy finds himself tired of the same old school routines. The boy, Nick, always has great new ideas that don't break the rules, but always stir up controversy and interest. He calls them \\"thought-grenades.\\" His biggest comes when a stiff English teacher tells him that words come about because people simply accept them as meaning what they do. He then invents a new word, frindle, to use instead of the word pen. It stirs a huge controversy that even he can no longer control. But the rewards are well worth the risk.<br /><br />This book has important ideas about free speech, learning and taking the right action. An inspirational story for all who want to make a difference.	2004-12-01

Until recently, I was one of those who had never picked up a \\"Harry Potter\\" book to do anything other than shelve it on a library shelve --- I had only seen the movies. Finally, my interest got the better of me and I decided I had to read the books. <br /> <br />I read the books in order, but \\"Goblet\\" was the first one I was inpsired to re-read. \\"Goblet\\" is the first of the longer books of the series, over double the size of previous editions. Nevertheless, it is a compelling tale from start to finish, and a very important turning point in the series. If you only read this once, I can pretty much guarantee that you will miss out on any number of important details. Read the book and enjoy it. Take a break from it if need be and then return to it to take in what you missed before. <br /> <br />Without spoiling too much detail, I will attempt to give a brief summary of what happens in the book. Harry Potter is invited to the World Quidditch Cup, in which a number of strange events take place. He then returns to Hogwart, where a competition threatens to place him in mortal danger. Readers also learn much more about Harry's magical world and about the vast culture of wizards from around the world that inhabit it.

In this story, Buster Baxter finds himself in danger of failing third grade if he doesn't receive at least a B+ on an important test.<br /><br />The book version makes a few important changes to the story. Unlike many other television adaptations, Stephen Krensky's alterations always seem to be for the better. This version enriches the story with new details and enlightening descriptions of character fantasy sequences. Also one important detail is changed --- in the television version, the characters are tested over everything they've learned in third grade, while in the book it is only a math test.<br /><br />The only problem with this adaptation is that a rather odd bit is left in regarding division. At one point, Francine and Muffy attempt to tutor Buster by having him split a group of 20 candies evenly. He correctly splits then into two sets of 10, but struggles when they ask him to split them into even groups of three. They then criticize him when he begins eating candies, even though he has the correct general idea --- 20 candies cannot be split evenly among a group of 3.	2004-11-26

Apparently, perhaps the author was thinking that those who needed only basic help would sit and just use the guide, while the more \\"hardcore\\" players would access the information online. The problem is that it's the hardcore players who are probably going to be getting the guide anyway. Maybe they have their game system in a completely different room from the computer. They got the guide because they wanted something with detailed information and pictures without having to print something out online. This defeats that purpose.<br /><br />The site referenced in the book no longer works, but fortunately you can still activate all of the old codes by visiting the guide section at Square Enix's website. In fact, the entire guide, with much more detail, is all available there. If you can do without pictures, it'd probably be much easier to copy and print the entire thing.<br /><br />Fortunately, I didn't shell out one cent for this strategy guide. Instead, I checked it out from the library. For that rate, I think I got my \\"money's\\" worth, a basic description of how to get through the major parts of the game. I would have been very disappointed if I had actually paid money for this.	2004-09-26

While I generally prefer the somewhat less \\"hardcore\\" mysteries, I found this book a bit too peaceful and uninteresting.<br /><br />There are two plots to this book - a murder mystery and a tale of a criminal called the Silencer who is somehow destroying sound systems across Martha's Vineyard. The Silencer plot seems at times to be more interesting than the murder mystery. The main action of the book throughout mostly focuses on the main character gallavanting throughout Martha's Vineyard and having numerous conversations with people hoping to piece together clues that will help him solve these two mysteries. Also closely connected are events involving a new computer that the main character's kids have been on his back to purchase.<br /><br />I think the major problem with this mystery was that I never really developed any sort of attachment to the characters. The major protagonist, a retired cop named J.W., is a prime example. He's apparently retired, yet seems to get involved in these private investigations for no particular reason and sort of unofficially reports to the police department. He's an okay character, but I never really feel any sort of suspense or danger with him, or much interest in his doings. The mystery he's trying to solve seems wholely uninteresting, mainly involving a bunch of people who almost seem like they'd be better off dead. The mystery just sort of wraps up at the end, without a very interesting conclusion, leaving everything back to the status quo.<br /><br />This was a mildly okay read, but I'm not really motivated to seek out any other books in this series.	2004-08-14

Temple is doing publicity for the appearance of a feng shui personality at a furniture store when what else should happen but murder. It turns out that the inner workings of this store are far more complicated than anyone could have ever thought and to figure things out, Temple will be hooking up with some unusual characters, while fending off some as well. Midnight Louie is also right in the middle of the action, along with some feline help, not that he still isn't the star.<br /><br /> The ending for this book is definitely one of the best yet of the series. In fact, there are a lot of great moments and surprises in this newest book of the series.<br /><br /> I really enjoy this series because it has a definite feel of realness about it. Sure, there are other stories about mystery-solving cats, but in this one I really feel like I get an in-depth look at all sides of the characters. Sometimes it's not pretty, but it definitely has me waiting for more. Shall we next be seeing &quot;Cat In a Purple Predicament?&quot; Nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.	2004-08-06

Arthur and Buster find that there's a fun game to be played with them after Muffy dismisses the collection she received as a useless birthday present. Arthur learns that his Grandma Thora was champion player and starts taking lessons from her, but finds that she didn't teach him everything.<br />Fans who saw the original television story will once again be pleased with Krensky's ending.

To discuss them in much detail would spoil certain key plot elements, but both they and the events of the story evoke strong emotions.<br />My favorite part is how the author seems to have a real understanding of the animation industry. After checking the cover flap, it turns out that he has worked in a number of jobs in animation. I think it brings a real authenticity to the book that makes for some very fascinating reading. The author seems to have some very strong opinions about certain aspects of the animation industry. The fictional animation company portrayed in the book has many parallels to some in the real world.<br />I was disappointed to learn that this is the first book in the series... but only because that means I can't run right out and read some more! I hope that there's another story soon, because this a great book that definitely deserves a followup.	2004-06-10

The entire book is filled with fascinating insights into the process of television directing. The interviewer does an excellent job of exploring all aspects of the process and interviewing directors in a wide range of television fields. Readers will almost certainly learn many things that they never knew about television directing and gain a new respect for the process.	2004-06-10

Each one is very detailed so that you can take a look for it yourself on the show. The author has a tongue-in-cheek style that makes for fun reading.<br />There are only couple issues I can think of. Sometimes when comparing some nits to the official companion book, you see that it isn't really a mistake. Also, occasionally the author will harp about something that could have a reason explanation, for example, the &quot;varying mass&quot; of Odo. The extra mass could simply going into and coming from a subspace pocket or something. One other thing is that the trivia questions can be rather obscure at times, ranging from anything to drink or food orders, to immemorable planet names. It seems they serve more as informational, rather than a testing of knowledge.<br />Overall, any flaws are far outweighed by the book's strengths. It's a shame that the author never did a guide for the remaining three seasons of the show. It would have been fun to see the nits for those seasons, but I guess there's always watching and observing to take care of that.	2004-05-16

Also included each episode are a few pictures from the episode itself.<br />My favorite part is the behind-the-scenes information revealed by the cast and crew. You learn the intentions and thoughts of the actors and many of the people working on the show. This enhances the enjoyment of the show as you understand what they liked, what they thought they could have improved and what points they were trying to make with certain things.<br />Also of great interest is the additional information spread throughout, analyzing particular aspects from the show or the season as a whole. Even if you don't consider yourself a &quot;trekkie&quot; and maybe more of a casual viewer, you'll definitely find something to interest you in this guide to the show.	2004-05-16

It was obviously an accident, but can Franklin bring himself to forgive her?<br />A moving story, that would have worked well on television if production hadn't been stopped. This one goes deep and the ending is very satisfying. Possibly the best Franklin television storybook to date.	2004-05-14

I'm not normally one to say this, but what we have here is an attempt at milking more money out of a children's television character.<br />\\"Franklin and the Contest\\" takes its main idea from the television story \\"Gee Whiz Franklin.\\" Previously only available in foreign markets, this and other fifth season \\"Franklin\\" stories have recently aired in the United States. However, the note on the inside cover that says it's based on a televison story is a joke. The contents of the book are sad distillation of the original script. The original story was a great tale about helping perserverance and helping out a friend. All we have here is a dopey story with a lot of the details changed about Franklin entering and winning a contest (which isn't even anymore close to what happened) originally. This sort of editing is sad and ridiculous and it's made worse by the unnatural feel of the dialogue and writing of the story.	2004-04-14

It seems to me like the series has kind of taken a new direction, a new feel and it really took time to shake out, but in this book it really works well.<br />This book brings in a couple of past elements that have worked well for the series in the past and also successfully adds some new characters. I don't want to say too much or really describe much for fear of giving something way, but I thought that these elements added a nice touch.<br />One more nice touch is moving the description of Qwilleran and his backstory and stuff to a prologue section. This stuff, while always nice to read, really does mainly just serve as introduction for anyone that might just be joining and so it really makes sense to place it in a prologue.<br />Although I would still prefer to read about Qwilleran actively pursuing and solving a mystery, at least Koko is in fine form in this episode. His catly behavior and death-howls are all well within character as well as his reactions to the various characters. Yum-Yum is preciously cute as always, her story mainly tying into something set up in &quot;The Private Life of the Cat Who...,&quot; Mrs. Braun's work compiling Qwilleran's essays on the cats.<br />I had said that trying for #26 would probably not be a good idea, but I went ahead and read anyway and this time I am left wanting more. If that is a good gauge of a story's worth, then this story definitely measures up.	2004-02-03

Franklin shares in the joy of his friend Bear's becoming a big brother and Bear learns that even though his parents are spending a lot of time with the baby, there's ways he can help as well.<br />One thing I really like about this rerelease is that a number of the recent \\"Franklin\\" book releases have included Franklin's sister Harriet in stories she wasn't in before, but this one correctly preserves the timeline of the series.

In this story, Franklin becomes a part of a type of combination Boy/Girl Scout group called Trailblazers and can't wait to start earning all sorts of neat badges. When he learns that it might take many months to earn his badges, he's at first disappointed, but after learning more about Trailblazers, he comes around and gets a special surprise too.<br />As always, the illustrations are superb, with great attention to detail and many striking full-page illustrations.

(And if you know about Franklin, then you know how important Sam is to him.)

The plot is solid and there are some nice illustrations. Readers will also identify with a lot of Franklin's feelings, especially as he begins to reconsider his decision to run away. My only complaint about this story is the alterations made from the television episode. For one thing, Franklin's baby sister Harriet was not in the television show in this episode, but the writers have been editing her into the storybooks, most likely as an attempt to try and change the timeline to make it look like she was in the show all along. The other big mistake is that the original story featured the excellent character Snail in a major role, whereas in this story he only appears on one page and doesn't even speak.	2003-06-17

Theyr'e fun to read and have interesting characters and dialogue. However, that doesn't seem to be the case here.<br />There are two main problems with this version of \\"Franklin's Trading Cards.\\" The first one is the striking lack of resemblance to the television episode on which it is based. Sometimes this can be a good thing, but the changes really aren't for the better. The television episode features both Snail and Goose in major roles, but they're completely absent from this story, fundamentally altering the plot. The other major change in the basic story (there are others, but of less importance) is a major difference in the ending. I won't spoil it, but it's completely untrue to the original ending. The second major problem is the dialogue. Usually, the dialogue in the \\"Franklin\\" series is interesting and, most importantly, natural. The characters speak, for the most part, just like you would expect real kids to speak. Not so in this story. Typical lines include: \\"I will eat Fly Krispy cereal for lunch and supper. ... I will make Fly Krispy squares for dessert.\\" Note the avoidance of contractions, a pattern which seems to hold true with only a few exceptions in the book.<br />I understand what's being attempted here. The writers are trying to bring the dialogue down to a level intended for a younger audience, as part of this new \\"Kids Can Read\\" series. But the result is an unexciting story and unnatural dialogue. Fans of the series will probably want to avoid this one and watch the well-written television episode on which it is based instead.	2003-05-30

(A situation that may be familiar to many readers.) Although Arthur's helpful to her, he also discourages her idea of teaching the gerbil tricks. But this doesn't stop D.W.! In addition to the good, original story, the book also includes wonderful illustrations and dedicated readers will be able to spot the name of at least one of Marc Brown's children. Recommended for Arthur fans and a must for D.W. fans.	2003-05-08

There was a lot of bad dialogue, it's hard to watch any season five episode with some of the voice actors they had and it was painful to watch the Brain attempting to be funny. However, the wonderful Stephen Krensky actually manages to make a bad story into one that's actually kind of fun to read. He does so by adding details that weren't in the television version and adding extra dialogue to enhance parts o the story. Also, he smartly removed a very bad gag involving Brain's brain telepathically communcating with other brains. A good read for all Arthur fans.	2003-03-14

This is a novelization of one of the lost fifth season episodes of the \\"Franklin\\" television series. This is one of many stories that viewers never got to see due to the cancellation of the program after the fourth season. Overall the story itself is fairly decent. Franklin is tired of having to go bed so early all the time and so he convinces his Mom to allow him to invite his friends for a \\"stay-up over.\\" However, his plans start to fail when all of his friends want to get some sleep, but he keeps trying to find ways to keep them awake.

Well, I got the book and immediately noticed Lilian's letter on the back cover of the book. (More on that later.) Unfortunately, this newest offering is no better than the previous and possibly even worse. How I long for the days in with Qwilleran and his cats actually got actively involved in solving cases. Does that happen here? Not even close. Qwilleran sort of gets involved in snooping around, but never gets actively involved.<br />Okay, well maybe that's not too good. But the story itself is interesting and keeps the reading wanting to read, right? Not really. The suspense level was about zero. In short, almost nothing interesting happened. Threads are picked up that never seem to go anywhere and there is little to hold the readers' interest. Even the return of Qwilleran's &quot;secret agent&quot; Celia Robinson does little to pick up the plot.<br />If you were hoping that maybe things would get better, don't read this book. Keep your good memories of past editions. I give it two stars for a story that I was at least able to follow from beginning to in with a little interest, although that may be too generous.<br />On the back cover of this book, Lilian Jackson Braun states that it is the 25th in the series and asks if we should try for 26. My answer is an emphatic no. The series is tired, the magic is gone, please let's just end it before it gets any worse.	2003-02-11

It's filled with well-written, cautionary tales of people who did astoundingly stupid things and paid the ultimate price: death, or in some less drastic cases, sterility.<br />If this were the only thing this book had, it would still be a good book. But this book offers far more than that. In addition to these tales (some certified and some not and both are clearly marked), there are Honorable Mentions (people who did stupid things but didn't pay the ultimate price, but who still might in the future) and Personal Accounts. The book is also sprinkled with the author's wisdom, applicable quotes and each chapter opens with a discussion of a topic related to the subject of the chapter. The book also integrates well with the website, where you can voice your opinion on the book or stories in it, submit new stories, or read more about a particular story in the book, or a topic related to it.<br />As the book says, the grimness of some of these tales makes it such that it may be that it's best read in small doses. But whether you learn something, or just laugh, you'll love The Darwin Arwards II.	2003-01-30

What better way to pander to today's audience, eh?<br />The thing is, selling out, or rather, not selling out, is actually an important theme of this book. When Francine finds her friend Muffy Crosswire watching the Backstreet Boys, she calls them \\"sellouts,\\" saying that they're only interested in money. She then creates her own band, based on the theme of not selling out. Things, however, begin to fall apart when Francine begins to suspect her band members of only being in it for the money. Then, the Backstreet Boys come and teach everybody a lesson about the appreciation of music.<br />So, it would seem that the book version of the Backstreet Boys \\"Arthur\\" special does not overdose on the Backstreet Boys, featuring them mainly towards the end of the story.

So I was pleased to find within the past year Miss Carol Nelson Douglas' Midnight Louie mysteries.<br />This edition of the series has some of everything. There's mystery, intrigue, suspense, humor and so much more. One of the really neat things is how the story explores such personal aspects of the characters, from a priest trapped in a situation where he must sacrifice his own personal values to save those dear to him, to a public relations woman going undercover despite the danger of a \\"stripper killer.\\"<br />To add to all of that, there's Midnight Louie and his saucy daughter Midnight Louise (not that he would ever admit to her parentage personally.) Much of the story is written by Midnight Louie himself, from his perspective and while this may sound cheesy, Midnight Louie is one heck of a writer, perhaps even better than Mrs. Douglas herself.	2002-07-10

But whether his comments are positive (&quot;Traffic&quot; [4 Stars]: &quot;powerful precisely because it doesn't preach.&quot;) or negative ('Inspector Gadget' [1 and 1/2 stars]: &quot;would it have killed them to add a real 'Inspector Gadget' cartoon as a warm-up and scene-setter'), Ebert often seems to be right on the money.<br />As if all of this weren't enough, the book is elevated with two interesting sections in the back: &quot;Film Festivals,&quot; a review of Film Festivals that Ebert has attended and &quot;Questions for the Movie Man,&quot; a collection of Ebert's question and answer columns.<br />Finally, at the end, there's a list of the star ratings Ebert has given for every review that's appeared in any of his books.	2002-06-15

That is until Arthur threatens that he just won't do his homework, in fact, he'll even skip school. Francine doesn't believe him and so she decides to call him on it- by daring him! Things escalate from there, until everyone in Arthur's treehouse is dared, including the studious Brain! You'll have to read the book to find out how they deal with this, but it all comes down to the lesson that you shouldn't do something you know is wrong simply to prove that you can. This book isn't as funny as some of the other Arthur chapter books and some of it is just weird, but overall it's still a decent story.	2002-04-28

Knows What True Power Is	Those who watch the \\"Arthur\\" show know that the program places a huge emphasis on the enjoyment of reading. The characters are passionate about their books, from once organizing a group against parents who wanted to ban a particular book, to waiting in long lines to get copies of their favorites. One character, however, who was always left out the mix was D.W., Arthur's adorable, amusing and to Arthur sometimes annoying little sister. That is, until \\"D.W.'s Library Card.\\" The television episode in which D.W. learned that all she needed to do to get a library card was to a write her name is now, appropriately, available in book form, ready to be checked out at libraries all over, or for your purchase. The old adage says \\"don't judge a book by its cover,\\" but it's hard to pass up a book with a cover featuring what is probably the most adorable picture of the D.W. character ever. The inside of the book is fully illustrated as well and the original story is kept mostly intact, with only extraneous plot points left out, probably to make things easier for the younger audience it seems to be targeted at, as well as (most likely) the parents and older siblings who have to read it out loud. A fine addition to the \\"Arthur\\" series, for both its pure value as a story and the good it will do in the drive to get kids excited about reading.	2002-04-27

It's a very ordinary kind of book, the kind with both a front cover, a back cover and pages in between. The kind of book in which anything can happen - and usually does. (End detective-style voice)<br />Generally, when you pick up an \\"Arthur\\" chapter book, you can rely on an amusing as well as educational story. Any story feature Buster in his detective mode, however, is in a class of it's own.<br />Buster gets a detective kit and starts looking for a mystery. He even gets really into the role, donning a coat and fedora. At first, though, he can't find a mystery. Then, Arthur is accused of stealing the quarters that he was collecting for the \\"Buy a Puppy For the Fire Department\\" project. Arthur knows he's innocent and so do we, so needs somebody to help him, giving Buster his first case. Solving mysteries though, Detective Baxter, soon learns, isn't as easy as it seems.<br />This book is enjoyable for readers of just about an age, assuming they've reached the reading level to read a 58 page story in chapter book format. For the best effect, watch the TV version of this story first and pay attention to Buster's voice when he's speaking as a detective. Then read the story using that style of voice.	2002-04-21

Jones book I read and I wasn't disappointed. Junie B. is a realistic portrayal of an amusing and cute kindergartener. She's can also be rather precocious and self-centered at times and this story teaches an important lesson about not being that way. The ending was surprising and in my opinion pleasant, although everything did not work out the way Junie had hoped, an unlikely hero emerged. As for Junie B.'s dialect, she speaks it like it is and I would agree that parents should probably monitor reading of these stories. Neverthless, that doesn't detract from a great story.	2002-04-20

I give this four stars for a well-written portrayal of what happened on the TV show, but there really isn't that much of the extra stuff. Also, it's not as humorous as some of the other stories.	2002-04-16

All Fired Up\\" on the \\"Arthur\\" television series. Fortunately, it isn't. It's a unique and beautifully illustrated story about fire safety that teaches children what they need to know and also manages to entertain in the process. D.W. fans will love seeing D.W. in her firefighter's hat as the \\"fire boss\\" as well as when she was just a little baby. The story is generally kept pleasant throughout, without arguing between Arthur and D.W. It also has a surprising and satisfying ending.	2002-04-11

This is a great series that teaches kids about sportsmanship in an interesting as well as humorous way. However, this book, \\"Arthur and the Best Coach Ever,\\" shows are startling lack of coordination between those working on the television show and those were developing the book series.<br />Both the television story and the book share a couple basic plot points. The soccer coach for Lakewood Elementary is no longer able to coach the team and Ed Crosswire is brought in as a replacement. In both versions, none of the kids are very happy, as they liked the old coach and Ed's coaching abilities are rather questionable.<br />The similarities stop about right there. In the book, Ed is presented as an inept coach who knows nothing about soccer and is always ignoring the team while he tries to run his automotive business from the sidelines. The team members begin to feel like they don't care about them, although really he's just caught in a pickle because he has no understanding of basic soccer concepts, or how to coach a team.<br />The exact opposite happens in the television episode. In the TV version, Ed seems to be quite knowledgable of soccer, even having played in the past, and tries to run the team like a machine, putting them through overly demanding drills.<br />Overall, \\"Arthur and the Best Coach Ever\\" is an okay story and in my opinion, somewhat better than the television version. Still, the lack of synergy between the TV show and the book causes confusion among followers of the seires and I'm not entirely certain what exactly this particular book teaches kids about good sportsmanship. Also, some of the humor found in the other \\"Arthur\\" books is missing. Pass on this one, and try one of the other, better, \\"Arthur\\" books instead.	2002-02-23

Her more recent offerings hadn't been what I had come to expect from the series and I hoped that perhaps things would pick up and the series would return to its previous quality. Unfortunately, I was disappointed...<br />In the past, Lilian Jackson Braun's works have been an excellent mixture of mystery, suspense, and storytelling. In recent \\"Cat Who\\" history though, and especially in this work, there's a couple of elements missing: the mystery and suspense! Instead, it reads more like one big story with some elements about a murder mixed in. Although it was a mildly interesting little story, there was really no suspense factor that would keep me wanting to read the book over some other book I might happen to have with me at the time. Some of the best things from past works are missing, such as Qwilleran actively working to stop murder plots, Koko and Yum Yum being a more significant portion of the story, and Celia Robinson- Agent 0013 1/2 being written once and forever written out of the series. On the positive side, one character is for the most part missing: Polly.<br />If you're just starting out on the series, or you haven't yet read all of the \\"Cat Who\\" books, don't read this one first. If you are a loyal fan, and can't abide by missing out on her this newest book, then try getting a copy of this from library first before deciding whether to buy. You may found you made a wise decision.<br />With this latest offering, Lilian Jackson Braun is not only up the creek, she's jumped the shark.	2002-02-09

As has already been noted, one of the biggest and most glaring problems with this guide is when it instructs you to equip a Revolver that you don't have. Specifically, when you reach the Coastal Ruins, the guide instructs you to \\"quickly equip the Revolver with LaserSight.\\" The thing is, you don't have one because the revolver isn't available until much later in the game, when you reach the City of the Dead. (Where the guide states that you can \\"pick up a Revolver, if you don't have it already.\\" Of course, you wouldn't have it already because it's not possible to get it before then.) The trick, actually, is to equip either the Crossbow to fire at the targets, follow the strategy another reviewer stated of using the grenade launcher followed by the shotgun, or load a super grenade into the grenade launcher and then one blow can take out all nine targets.<br />If this was the only problem, then perhaps the guide would still be worthwhile. This guide, however, also completely misses out on many cool secrets. This is absolutely insane, as the spine states \\"ALL SECRETS REVEALED.\\" Yet it misses two very easy secrets at the beginning of the Valley of the Kings, making this a blatant lie!<br />Edit--- okay, so now I realize that the book actually does reveal all secrets- *in a separate section in the book of the book that isn't mentioned anywhere in the course of the normal text!* How, I ask, is that helpful? (Which means, of course, that they stuck in some time after they were originally finished writing the guide, just so they could claim on the cover, \\"All Secrets Revealed.\\" Sorry, doesn't wash.)<br />Add in descriptions that often confusing (despite provided photos) and you have a guide that, while it may get you through the game, is definitely not worth of the title of \\"Prima's Official Strategy Guide.\\" Don't buy this strategy guide. Instead, just locate one of the many walkthroughs available online. Not only are you more likely to get complete information because site readers can e-mail in if the guide-writer misses something, but you can also check against other walkthroughs to make sure you're not missing anything. The only problems I see with this is if you must have something to hold in your hands (you could print one, if you don't mind using up printer ink, or you have a hookup where you can print stuff for free), or if you don't have Internet access (in which case you wouldn't be reading this.)readers can e-mail in if the guide-writer misses something, but you can also check against other walkthroughs to make sure you're not missing anything.

When Buster &quot;rescues&quot; a cat from a tree, he at first denies that it was an act of heroism; he just happened to be in the right place at the right time. As more and more attention starts be heaped on him, he starts to really get into being a hero, even starting a script for his own television series, which he states will be &quot;edutainment.&quot; (&quot;It's supposed to be a combination of entertainment and education, but often ends up being the worst of both.&quot;) When he starts trying to get the Brain to do his homework and being otherwise pompous, his friends start hatching schemes to try to bring his eager down to size.

Danger.com \\"Most Wanted\\" is a well-written story with characters that its teenage audience should be easily able to relate to. There's Andy, a somewhat troubled teenage guy, who's life crashes around him. There's Andy's Mom, a single business-woman who tried to hide from Andy that he was adopted. There's also Syd, who's deep and intelligent, but also sometimes annoying with her name-calling and eating of health food. Therefore, even those are not adopted should be able to relate to something in this story. I gave it four stars because it seems to drag at times, and I didn't think much of the ending, but overall it's a pretty good read. Of course, there's also the Internet aspect, the idea that a story like this could really happen to someone who's not careful with what they do on the Internet. One complaint related to that aspect is when I tried to visit the Internet site listed inside the book, ...... I got a not found error. Very annoying.	2001-12-31
