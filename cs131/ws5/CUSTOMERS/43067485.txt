Dwayne lost his touch with Never Say Never while it was mislabeled as a \\"follow-up\\" to The Womanizers.  It was like Never Say Never was written before...but much better. How many books are already out there about sista-friends going through relationship drama while having each other's back?? Too many! The edgy and sometimes gripping storylines that I've read in Dwayne's past books were definitely missing here. The characters were weak and judgmental. Mike's cameo was cut too short and I really wasn't sure what Ahmad and Shay's place in the book was to begin with.  A twist should have been added to one of the chapters. The \\"happily ever after, everything is now okay\\" ending just didn't sit right with me. It was like everyone changed their minds and altered their personalities.  <br />Nothing surprising at all. <br /> <br />Dwayne, you do a much better job when \\"the fellas\\" are your protagonists so why not bring it back? <br />  <br />	2005-09-22

Harlem wasn't your typically street-girl-done-come-up character. Her mentality was unique. The girl was classy beyond words and wise beyond her years but with a hint of ghettoism when she needed it the most. I read this book in less than a day. When I wasn't completely shocked, I was laughing with exhilaration or crying with heartbreak. Here's a story that forced me to take a closer look at my own life and uncover a personal hidden strength for what God has in store. It's too good of a book for me to tell the storyline so go out and support this amazing author by buying it yourself.	2005-09-21

Only the intelligent can decipher Dickey as he writes in his infamous poetic fashion... He's sure to sing a thought-provoking song on every page. His almost lyrical word-medley running off the pages was practically more interesting than the story content itself... <br /> <br />It was quite odd that a married AIDS researcher of all people would have an uncontrollable libido and participate in casual intimacy at the drop of a dime with his wife's assumed sister - a woman he knew nothing about!  Although written in a similar fashion, Genevieve didn't quite capture me like The Other Woman did. Genevieve dragged on far too long before any revelations occurred. Like many readers, I found myself losing interest. I would put the book down for days before picking it up again.  It's true that some people have skeletons in their closet and a dark past... Shameful that such a presumed intelligent man had to go through such lengths to learn his own wife's history...I guess communication in relationships is a thing of the past regardless of education and status level. Dickey could have created this couple as high-school educated retail clerks for all the difference it would have made. But EJD, you're still the man... <br />	2005-06-09

I'm speechless after reading newcomer Trista Russell's debut novel. Her effort was outstanding. I love her writing style. I felt very close to main character, Sarai. A part of me could empathize with what Sarai was going through. I didn't quite understand why she didn't leave well enough alone when she knew what was at stake. Choosing to get back at those men was a dangerous decision. I loved how Trista tied three endings to the novel. I'm anxious to read the conclusion. Conrad was pretty much left out of the ending... I'm very interested in reading his reaction to Sarai's antics. I want to read what becomes of Savion and what becomes of their father. I'm desperate to know if Sarai lives or dies... Does Tramel really take her back? What happens to Damion??  <br /> <br />Hurry and bring us another page-turner, Trista. Inquiring fans want to know! <br />	2005-02-27

Anyone who chooses to read this is better off NOT reading Drama Queen first. It's almost as if the characters were changed. I thought Anjelica was written off at the end of the first story...(On the day they were supposed to wed, Kayla buried her sister--pg 272, Drama Queen). In No More Drama, Anjelica has magically come back to life with a personality 180 and an explanation for all of her transgressions.. I guess anything can happen in a fictional tale, but can we at least add a pinch of reality?     Overall, there seemed to be too much going on in so few pages. I actually needed to use Drama Queen as a reference tool to try and make sense out of this mess. I wasn't successful at all.     Lajill, you should skip the \\"drama\\" all together in your next effort. It's slowly dying and some things can't be recuperated.	2005-02-07

The nonstop drama and fast-pace kept me on the edge of my seat. I managed to connect with each character's emotions...but didn't necessarily understand their mindset.  Mya was pitiful... Sad to say that women like her do indeed exist. I was proud of Max in the end even though I never understood why. Dwayne could have done a better job at digging deeper in to Max's reasoning. I guess it's safe to say that a near death experience could change who you are. Shay was one of the stronger characters... She was proof that even strength can't defy love.  I still wonder if the men hadn't gotten caught up in their womanizing ways, would they have ever stopped and learned to appreciate and respect their women? Probably not and that's true to life. Good job, Dwayne.	2004-10-21

I couldn't even finish it. Just like another reviewer wrote, there was far too much emphasis on racial stereotype. A marriage between two different races is not uncommon nowadays. You would think this book's setting took place decades ago! Do strangers really stop people to offer derogatory comments on their biracial children? What got me was the scene at the mall. The cops asked Renee to show proof that Janae was her child? Unreal! All of this was utterly distasteful to say the least. <br /> <br />Also, Renee was pretty faceless throughout the story. I couldn't form a picture of her or connect with her in any way (other than the attitude leaving a lot to be desired). Why was she always so bitter? Was it me, or did we only learn her age halfway through the book? <br /> <br />The Giovanni tragedy was sudden and seemed out of place in the story. Again, I couldn't connect at all. <br /> <br />Mr. Murray..... why do you feel the need to justify your writing?

Mr. Joseph initially captured me with his contribution to A Dollar and a Dream. Reading this story was no disappointment. The writing flowed well. Good usage of flashbacks and past-tense dialogue carried me through the chapters. Each character displayed a certain level of strength that you just don't read about in today's fiction novels. The friendship between Roy, Colin, and Vic was genuine. I could feel a natural bond with the characters and found myself wanting what was best for them. True love is color blind. I applauded the way Vic handled his situation with Julie and still managed to work things out with Latrice in the face of adversity in the name of love. Colin is a symbol of hope for all brothers. I felt sorry for Roy and all Stacey took him through with her emotional baggage.  <br /> <br />My guy friend told me that Mr. Joseph is selling \\"the code\\" to women. All I can say is, do your thing, dog! Can't wait to cop the next one. <br />	2004-08-18

Although it's a quick read, I was absolutely bored halfway through the book. All throughout the book, Kayla was surrounded by people that loved her and supported her (other than Anjelica). It kind of alleviates the drama when so many people have your back. I never understood why Kayla had such a hard time telling her father about her condition. It didn't make sense at all. I also didn't get why Geno kept popping up wherever she went. Talk about coincidence! It started to get ridiculous. Was he stalking her or were they living in a very small town? <br /> <br />LaJill brought a nice mix of supporting characters in to the book...but their personalities/roles needed to be a bit more defined.  Kayla's three girl friends didn't appear to have any individualism at all. The last couple of chapters were captivating. It's nice to know that this book will have a sequel. Too many questions were left unanswered. It's also apparent that the Kayla/Geno/Craig love triangle is far from over.  I would like to read much more about the mystifying Craig. His lies and betrayals left me perplexed.	2004-08-14

I agree that the ending left a lot to be desired...however, that's what keeps a loyal fan anticipating the next volume in this intriguing saga of the lives of Reesy and Misty. How long did we patiently wait for this continuation? I'm happy to patiently wait for the next....I'm hooked!    Reading Scenes from a Sistah and Getting to the Good Part are a MUST before picking this one up. This story ended exactly how I wanted it to. The love between Reesy and Dandre is beatiful. I didn't think anything that occurred was unrealistic. Despite popular beliefs, some African-Americans do come from money. Also, I can't count the numbers of times I've wanted to pack my bags and drive straight across the country...leave my worries behind - start anew. Who says that's the answer, but I commend Reesy for having the strength to do so. What I wouldn't do to have a friend like Sleazy in my corner.

I'll give it 4 stars only because it didn't take too long to read. I wasn't utterly disappointed, but I expected a lot more. The murder and mayhem didn't read like a Carl Weber novel at all... For a second I felt like I was reading a novel by Zane. In parts of the book, I didn't quite feel his voice like I normally do. His touch of originality was also missing. Seemed like I read this one before. The ending left a lot to be desired.. I wish he'd brought in a few more characters from Married Men to bring the story full-circle. Those guys from Married Men were Wil's closest friends...it was unreal that they didn't each make cameos to help see him through the mess that he and Diane experienced. I wouldn't mind reading more about Trent and Melanie in the future....but Wil as a focal character is an absolute bore. Let's try it again, Carl.......	2004-04-12

I wasn't quite so captured by most of the stories by the no-namers, and yes, the erotic story lines took time to jump off in some of them. If Zane thought these were the best out of all the tales submitted to her, I guess the rest were absolute garbage. Zane's Flood stories at the end were a bore as was the story about the \\"treats\\"... Zane should have perhaps mentioned on the back cover of the book that some of the stories were about same ... sexual encounters since that is an entirely different type of flava...	2004-03-16

Although Mr. Holmes writes flashbacks providing background information about each of main the characters, thus letting the reader know what lead them to their current circumstances, a lot was left to be desired. I never understood that if Goldie wanted to leave so badly, why didn't she just go? I found it hard to believe that Kat was taking ALL of her money making it impossible for Goldie to stash in order to get from under her wing. Goldie was a shamefully powerless character. Weak in the mind with a tough-girl demeanor. Yuck.<br />I also didn't understand the Jules' shooting scene at all. Goldie hated Kat. Why in the world did she kill for her? Jules could have been written out of the story completely and it wouldn't have made much difference in the outcome of the book. Right before Kat kicked Goldie out, Goldie had been upstairs packing her suitcases with every intent to leave anyway, trying to find the courage to break the news to Kat. Why in the world did Goldie show resistance when Kat kicked her out? Why did she ask where she should go? Where was she planning to go with her bags already packed? I also didn't understand why Goldie didn't try to reach Tender on her cell phone since it was obvious that she couldn't get to Tender through Kat. Did anyone else notice that the ending narration in one of the chapters stated that it would be the last time that Goldie spoke to Kat, yet, she spoke to her again in one of the following chapters? Shame on Mr. Holmes for his lack of synchronization in this story.  <br />I thought a lot of other pieces of the book were also missing and there was no real climax in the story. The characters were niave and unbelievable and the ending was dull and ill.  Even though the fight between Kat and Tender seemed to be pulled right from Players Club (the dressing room fight between Ronnie and Diamond - where's Cube's credits?), don't compare this to the movie. Players Club was better, hands down!	2003-12-13

True To The Game started out interesting, but it lost me towards the middle of the book... This book had no structure. I didn't quite connect with any of the characters or even the story line, for that matter.

This book accompanied me to bed a many night and praises are due to Mary B. Morrison for doing the thing in this tale that forces me to go out and cop Soul Mates Dissipate and Never Again Once More. This was more than just some drama-filled story about sex and deceit that is becoming more and more common of today's fictional authors. Mary's book was hot and spicy while karma was displayed two-fold. What a splendid story and I definitely walked away with a lesson. I look forward to reading what becomes of Fancy in Mary's next novel.

Here's another disappointment by Zane! The Heat Seekers was absolute garbage, but since she has produced quality work in the past (Addicted), I decided to give the sista another chance and support her latest effort. Big mistake! The Sisters of APF isn't worth the paper the book is printed on.<br />This book has absolutely no premise. Where was the climax? What was the point? Reading about Mary Ann, Patricia and Olive and their multiple sexual escapades did nothing for me. It was all in vain. You gotta hand it to Zane for depicting the men in the novel (Clarence, Trevor, Hakim, Alejandro) as absolute imbeciles. They were madly in love with these women and seemingly faithful minus a minor indiscretion here and there. Meanwhile, the women are participating in multiple encounters with various partners in every place imaginable from alleys to firehouses. All of this is painted as justifiable throughout the book and the men have NO CLUE!! Pray tell, how is having sex with nine men in one night treating your body as a \\"temple\\"? This is not my idea of being sexually unrepressed at all... There are other terms for this type of behavior! <br />All in all, this is most likely the last book I'll ever cop from this author unless she can do a complete 180. Instead of dropping a rushed novel every three months, Zane could learn a lot from her counterparts who put out a quality and developed 5 star story every year or so.	2003-08-29

I only purchased it because I wanted to continue to support her after she delivered a first effort (When You Look At Me) that was remarkably one of the best books I've ever read.<br />Backfield in Motion's story line just didn't grip me. Reading this book took too much effort. It was far too fictatious and overwritten at times (e.g. constant emphasis on Duane's nine-inches). The ongoing battle between Asia and Sylvia bored me - I was hoping some drama would kick off, but there was nothing. They found that the best way to handle conflict was to avoid one another (yawn). It also seemed to me that Asia lost her own personal identity in Duane. There's nothing wrong with being a housewife and a mother, but somewhere down the line she lost sight of herself and I think that is what this book advocated. The only pivotal moment in this book was the Epiphany tragedy.  <br />By the way, if Ms. Biggs is reading this, I wanted to point out that my city doesn't have a football team. What was up with that?? I'm rating your book one star less than I would have just for that inaccuracy.	2003-08-13

The entire concept of the tale was lame, the plot was weak, the characters were uninteresting, and the overall writing just did not hold my attention.<br />EJD has done a complete 360! I applaud his latest effort. The writing was brilliant. The wording was almost poetic. He amazingly and effortlessly succeeded at writing first person using a woman protagonist. Yvette was the perfect supporting character. Any sista could use a friend like her. Eric Jerome Dickey knows women, he knows sensuality, he knows romance, he knows drama, and he is the voice of all scorned brothas. Hear him roar in this tale of a beautiful marriage of two successful individuals that turned sour almost overnight in the blink of an eye. Following \\"Freckles\\" through her journey of happiness,  heartbreak, pain, agony, contempt, fulfillment, and self-discovery opened my eyes. The ending left me speechless.

Some of the stories were better than others, but that's to be expected from a collection. I got more out of the stories by not reading them in order (start with a few in &quot;off the hook&quot; and work your way back to &quot;wild&quot;). Some of Zane's more graphic details I thought were perhaps over exagerrated or more or less, wishful thinking. Even still, the bulk of the stories were satisfying in the worst way. One suggestion I would have for Zane is to give up on the second person writing. It's harder to follow and is almost like reading a journal entry. I'm much more interested in the gritty dialogue.	2003-02-25

As I close yet another one of his page-turning masterpieces, I wonder again what inspires his ideas. This book is remarkable, witty, candid, scandelous, and oozes ingenious and originality. I found myself at times laughing, crying, and wanting to ring the necks of the characters.

I loved how the author forsaked proper grammer and puncuation, choosing to right the story like words that flow from the mouth. It gave the book a definite feel of reality and I read it conversation style, deeply in touch with the characters. The narration lifted me - first person would have done no justice for this tale. Instead of just sticking with a one-sided story of the main character, background information was provided about all of the supporting characters as well - present, past, future - I loved it.

Nikai had a lot of personal issues that she needed to deal with but chose to spend her time seeking happiness in other people. The relationship between Nikai and Robert never cultivated even though the author allowed years to elaspe. I never understood what their beef was with one another. They spendt a lot of time declaring their love but never once was any love shown. The drama-driven family situations and friendships that surrounded them seemed to be heavily unrealistic at times. I was lost in a 400+ page tale that could have easily been written in half the pages along with a point.	2002-10-30

She had the right idea when  deciding to write this novel. Its focus on the workplace setting and corporate America made it a rare commodity in fiction and any office worker could easily relate to the overall setting. <br />However, I didn't care for the immorality that transpired throughout the tale. Joyce was a middle-aged and successful black woman in a high position at a top corporation for twenty or so years. Why did the author feel the need to give her a deep, dark, and degrading past that explained how she landed her position? I truly believe that black women like Joyce (and myself) can be succesful in corporate America without scandel. Also, why did the author make Joyce a quitter who ran away with her tail between her legs instead of fighting the good fight, like women of color ought to be portrayed? <br />Faulkner was assiduos. Why did the author fail to make Fred recognize Faulkner only for her diligence? She had all of the traits of a corporate leader. What was up with the end of the story? Whatever happened to holding on to your dreams? What kind of message is the author sending? <br />The tale of Margaret was heartbreaking and unfinished, leaving me hanging in the air. I really wanted to know what became of Lisa, the main source of Margaret's pain. <br />I really appreciated Greg's cameo, but I was hungry for more.  Hopefully, Ms. Spencer will make Greg the primary focus again in her third novel.	2002-08-09

This book is a welcome addition to my collection of erotica.

I was sorely disappointed!! Throughout the book, I kept wondering, \\"When will I get to the good part? Where's the vivid ... scenes?? Where's the peak story line?\\" Didn't happen!!<br />Zane's faceless characters lacked depth. The first chapter of the book was somewhat juicy, but then \\"Tempest\\" did a personality 360. I had to wonder if I was still reading about the same character. Someone needs to tell Zane that readers are not picking up her latest effort to read about self-proclaimed celibacy. Geez!! <br />The entire book read like amateur writing. There wasn't even a story line. What a flop!... Better luck next time...	2002-07-15

The author sings a song in her writing that touches the soul. She touched all aspects of Sara's life and brought it together in a roundabout way. She continued to develop the characters and the plot in to a unified whole. This was a love story with a taint of suspense that kept me turning the pages. The funeral scene had me in tears. <br />After reading the author's &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, I was somewhat intrigued at how the characters in the story mirrored a few of her actual family and friends. It left me to wonder how much of the story was based on events that truly happened. I look forward to reading more from this author.	2002-07-15

Reading it was almost like listening to juicy gossip or having a good friend confide in you. I blamed Mia for her problems and not so much Brice. Mia was in over her head to begin with! I found myself almost willing her to develop into the strong, independent woman that her character needed to be. Brice reminded me of men I've known in the past and was a refreshing reminder of the type of men women need to avoid. It was nice to get a peek into the life of a military man as I've never been exposed to this lifestyle. To me, Christian could have been a better friend. Just \\"being\\" there wasn't enough. What was he trying to do, wait until something drastic happened before attempting to knock some sense into his friend? The heart can't be lied to, and he was suffereing from some serious denial throughout the book. I'd like to see another book by this author focusing more on Christian and what he really wants out of life. He's the type of man who could make a woman one lucky lady.<br />A welcoming first effort from Electa and I hope to read more of her work in the future!	2002-02-02

The plot signified reality even when I hoped things would get better. Tammy and Hassan's love for each other was utterly genuine which doesn't always equal a bed of roses. <br />I loved how their children were active characters in the book. They weren't just given a name and pushed to the side so that the focus could be on the adults like so many other authors tend to do. We were allowed to actually see the children grow up along with watching Tammy's development as she became more responsible with age.<br />I loved Ms. Biggs writing style and how she allowed us to see the story from both Tammy and Hassan's perspectives. They told the tale jointly but through different eyes and it was amazing in comparison at how differently men and women think and feel and view the same situation. Kudos to Ms. Biggs for skillfully bringing this to life.<br />The only bad part to me about this book was the bad editing and  the Tom character. It was almost as if he was created as a Prince Charming to save Tammy from the harsh depths of reality. A man old enough to be her father? Please. Ms. Biggs could have done better at attempting to find a way to reer Tammy's heart from Hassan. What was with the instant marriage thing? This should be a rewrite.<br />Although I didn't care for that part of the book, the ending left me thirsty for more! Hassan knows what he wants and there's probably not a man who can't relate to Hassan's feelings for Debbie. I agreed that he made the right decision in the interim, but he and Tammy simply belong together. I literally cried tears as their deep love for each other tore at my heart. <br />Ms. Briggs, I hope you're currently in the process of writing the sequel and please don't let it be a disappointment!	2002-01-11

Mark and Nicole were a couple who had it all. Based off of a few minor misunderstandings, they were ready to throw it all away. Where was the communication? At times I felt they were acting like children. Nicole was a nieve, spoiled, crybaby who never once considered confronting the woman she thought was trying to steal her husband. Had she have done this, I wonder what Ashlei what have said. It would have made the story a lot more interesting. I also think Nicole got off way to easy with the situation with Nick. The fact that he left her 3 million dollars was a bit unrealistic as well seeing that he had a wife and two teenage children. How much money did he leave them, or was that not a factor? If Nicole and Mark had sat down, talked, and behaved like adults in the beginning, there would have not been much of a book for Ms. Faye to write at all.	2001-11-18

Once I finally got past the very slow start of the early childhood scenes, I couldn't put it down. However, being the critic I am, I do have to point out why I couldn't give this winner five stars. First of all, like several others have already pointed out, some of the terminology Zane used in her early chapters did not reference the seventies and early eighties accurately. Writers (and film producers as well) need to be a bit more careful when doing their flashbacks to go ALL THE WAY back, lingo and all. Also, the ending was way too overdramatic. I just couldn't picture the scene at the cabin happening in real life. It reminded me of an ending scene from &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; or &quot;Scream&quot;. Definitely, unrealistic, but entertaining, nonetheless. The fact that STD's were never a factor was also very untypical of today's world. The sex scenes were definitely the best I've ever read. I hope that I can give this author's next effort the full 5 stars it'll probably deserve.	2001-11-14

It was confusing at times and caused the book to lose focus. There was just too much going on, I guess.

It's not like it was referred to as a nickname. To me, this appeared to be the character's actual name. It was baffling and mysterious in a &quot;I don't get it&quot; kind of way. One thing about the book I didn't care for was the excess amount of background information about Babysister's life that was provided. Readers are forced to read through page after page of past details, most not even relevant to the current plot. I found myself skimming through a lot of pages. Other than that, I enjoyed the book overall and thought it had a catchy ending.  It was a trip to read what was going through this sistah's head.	2001-11-09

I have no idea how she did it, but it was good to get inside Greg's head. This book actually helped me understand the opposite sex a bit better. I found myself falling in love with Greg and wishing he were real so that I could hop the first plane to Dallas :) Adrian was a sick and confused sistah to say the least. I would easily rate this author's first effort five stars if it weren't for the very predictable outcome. It was bizarre that Greg didn't see the warning signs as he told this  story first person when the average reader could see right through Adrian's schemes.

Ms. Files passed the test. I was happy that Reesy was our potaganist this time around and we were allowed to get into this WILD girl's head. At times I felt she was acting like a 22 year old rather than a 32 year old, but I was impressed with her development throughout the book. Inside her tough as nails &quot;hand in your face&quot; sister-girl deameanor, she was a very emotional and sensitive person. I literally cried tears with her as she discovered a love lost. Ms. Files did an EXCELLENT descriptive job of putting Reesy in touch with her feelings. There's not a woman out there who can't relate to this type of love and pain. It was emotionally real. <br />We saw a different side of Misty in this story as well. Her character wasn't quite as developed as Reesy's, but her maturity was evident. <br />I loved the way Ms. Files ended the book on a closed note, not leaving the readers looking for more.

I purchased it well over three months ago and I'm only halfway through it. It's VERY slow paced. This automatically makes me give a book a lower rating because I'm a reader who can usually finish a book that's well worth reading in about two to three days tops. If the book is a real page turner, I'll finish it in hours, losing sleep if I have to. If you're in to the subject matter, I suggest trying your luck at reading this.

Due to all the positive reviews it received, I expected something a bit more explosive. It took me awhile to get past the first few chapters. It's not like I didn't have the time. It was just whenever I picked it up, I felt the urge to put it back down again after reading a page or so. I took it on vacation with me and finally progressed throughtout the book. <br />Marcus Major writes with too much narration and not enough dialogue. I hated his character &quot;Bunches&quot; from the start. She was a spoiled little Miss Know It All that the four men treated like gold. Mr. Major should have developed her more to give her a bit more of a personality instead of letting the four men run her throughout the book. <br />The ending was RUSHED. Go figure. Once Bunches' and ????'s relationship was out in the open, I expected the book to continue so that readers could see what would come out of it and see how the other three guys would except the relationship after their initial shock. Mr. Major didn't give readers that option. The way he ended the book, a sequal is needed.	2001-10-15

I enjoyed &quot;Not A Day Goes By&quot;, but was outright disappointed by this sequel. Can you say &quot;Too much name dropping!!&quot;. Someone needs to tell Mr. Harris that in order to make fiction writing more effective and realistic, it's best to chill some of the nationally known names and events. Especially when they're so recent. I would much rather read about make-believe stars and envision them as being real then read about Billboard's top 50 and how his character ranks among them. You could easily see how Mr. Harris rushed the book's ending. It was as if he got tired of writing or had somehow lost his creative touch. In this rush, he failed to give readers any outcome of several major events. One of those events being Basil's livelihood. Instead, Mr. Harris spent time having Yancey and Basil explain to each other the events that took place in the book. Events the reader was already aware of. Terrible writing style!  <br />Oh yeah, each main character in the book (except one) were cruel and enjoyed inflicting harm to others. Funny how they all got off easily and got to live happily ever after. Is that the message Mr. Harris wants to send, that it's ok to hurt people because you might get away with it? The one character that was punished, was actually the only character who did not deliberately hurt or attempt to hurt anyone. <br />Better luck next time, Mr. Harris.	2001-08-06
