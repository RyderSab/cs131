She tells her story in short segments, some touching, some pitiful, some just baffling. <br />Though my heart ached for Katie, I learned that she is made of tough stuff -- she's \\"durable goods\\" and not fragile glass. Author Elizabeth Berg can pack quite an emotional wallop into a few phrases or sentences. Here is one example: \\"Those days, my mother always sounded like a poem. She couldn't do a whole sentence; it took too much air. So she would say pieces like that. Sometimes, even if you felt bad she was dying, you'd want to yell, 'What! Just say it!' Even if you were loving her so much, your fists clenched and your heart feeling like it had a tight peel around it, you would get mad like that.\\"<br />I would recommend this book both to adult readers and to adolescents experiencing their own coming of age.	2003-09-21

Satrapi grew up in 1970s Iran with two outspoken parents who encouraged her to express her views. Coming of age into a country in tumult, she discovers that expressing her views might not always be welcome or safe. Truly funny moments, including Satrapi's dad smuggling contraband rock music posters under his coat, bump up against moments of horrifying brutality and upheaval. Will Marjane &quot;bow her head and let the wave pass&quot; or will she stand up against oppression?<br />I started this book knowing very little about Iran and its people. Not only did I get to know a brave and intelligent young woman, I also learned a lot about a country's role in modern history.	2003-09-21

Each re-reading uncovers a new delight. This book encompasses the first years of Anne and Gilbert's married life, spent in the seaside town of Four Winds Harbor.<br />I can't decide which character in the book is my favorite. Maybe it's Cornelia Bryant, outspoken but good hearted, whose rants about the uselessness of men accompany her ever-present needlework. Or it could be the beautiful, heartbroken Leslie Moore, whose natural intelligence and vivacity have been dulled, but not extinguished, by a series of tragic life events. Or maybe it's gentle Captain Jim, who captivates the Blythes with his tales of world travel, sea adventures, and the lost love of his life. <br />The book contains an interwoven medley of incidents large and small, joyous and sad, culminating in the revelation of a spectacular truth that has a powerful impact on the major characters.	2001-05-28

Also during that time, Steve met his first love and experienced the worst kind of heartbreak. <br />As Steve relates the sometimes wonderful, sometimes painful story of those years, he alternates with commentary on his senior year in San Diego: his academic recovery, fueled in part by a new love interest, and his reconciliation of long time tension with his father, a famous astronaut.<br />The novel's structure highlights the downward trajectory of Steve's Houston years, contrasted with the upward swing of his year in San Diego. Thomas tells Steve's story with a mix of clever humor, engrossing early-90s trivia, and non-sentimental, realistic teenage emotions. Highly recommended.	2001-05-28

They are phantoms of the people who factored in his life over the years: from his working class childhood in Albany, from his glory days as a baseball star, from his spitfire years as a union rabble rouser, and from his present life as an alcoholic drifter. The ghosts appear to Francis as real people, each with a memory to a relate or a past wrong that Francis must make peace with.<br />His past is full of regrettable mistakes: the &quot;scab&quot; he killed with a well-aimed rock, the infant he accidentally dropped, the insane bum he killed in self defense, the woman he left behind when his grief became too overwhelming, and the woman he now keeps company with, who has borne his rage and misery.<br />Francis is a lost man, but the story of his coming to terms with all the pain in his existence is both haunting and uplifting. There was not a character in this book that didn't arouse my sympathy and, ultimately, my respect.	2001-03-17

I chuckled over Fadiman's countless true and amusing insights, such as the division of the world into those who constantly and subconsciously proofread written material and those who do not. I delighted in Fadiman's many perfect and seemingly effortless turns-of-phrase. Fadiman manipulates the language so skillfully that she risks seeming condescending, but she never does. Rather, she comes across as a lover of words and a sincere bibliophile.<br />After reading a library copy of this book, I purchased my own, because I knew I would want to re-read and savor the insights on varied aspects of reading: the odd shelf in a personal library, reading aloud, plagiarism versus borrowing, marriage and the merging of books, and reading books in their settings. This book has earned an honored spot on my bookshelf.	2001-03-11

But are there some areas of human experience that transcend the healing power of stories? Anita Shreve explores this question in &quot;The Weight of Water.&quot;<br />Jean, a journalist, is researching an article about a brutal double murder that occurred in 1873 on Smuttynose Island, an isolated encampment off the New Hampshire coast. Jean's husband, five year old daughter, brother-in-law, and his girlfriend accompany her to the island where she takes photographs, and to a nearby town where she discovers a journal written by an eyewitness to the murders. The journal's author, Maren, lived on Smuttynose, survived the murders by hiding in a cave all night, and later identified the killer. Or so the story goes.<br />Maren's journal reveals a life of incredible isolation and psychological distress, strained by outside forces (much as Jean's own marriage is strained). Maren's repressed sadness and rage eventually build to a moment of release, one that will affect her and her family forever. Beneath her story lies Jean's own, likewise one of sadness, repression, and hidden anger that is headed for its own moment of release.<br />More compelling and sadder than &quot;The Pilot's Wife,&quot; this novel shows Shreve as a true master of the human heart.	2001-03-06

After his death, new information is revealed -- Jake had another wife and child in Ireland, and had also hidden information about his mother, his job, and his involvement with the IRA from Kathryn.<br />As Kathryn absorbs the shock of these revelations, past incidences take on a new significance; missed phone calls and arguments begin to make sense. Kathryn had never suspected Jake because she loved and trusted him -- she'd felt as if she had no reason to doubt him.  <br />Now, at the same time as she learns the truth about her husband, Kathryn is also learning about some secrets that Maddie, her fifteen year old daughter, has concealed from her.<br />So, how well do we know those we love? Shreve's answer: not very.	2001-02-23

His happiest times are spent on the field playing goalie. When he moves to Lake Windsor, Florida, and learns that his handicap may keep him off the school team, he is in despair.<br />When a sinkhole swallows part of his new school, Paul has the opportunity to transfer to a school across town, where he can perhaps play for the soccer team. That school, Tangerine Middle, is quite different from the Lake Windsor school. The students are mostly from working-class families who live in Quonset huts, rather than upper-middle class families who populate the brand-new developments of Lake Windsor. At first, Paul is wary about fitting in, until he starts to realize the flaws in the world of his family and their friends.<br />Paul begins to ask some tough questions: Why was the Lake Windsor school built on unstable ground? Why do the expensive Lake Windsor homes have so many problems? Why does his own family keep so many secrets, especially about his older brother, Erik, who is on his way to becoming a football star but has a worrisome mean streak?<br />As Paul presses to find answers to these questions and others, he uncovers layers of deception and some terrible, wonderful truths. A highly engaging, thought-provoking book, Tangerine is one of my favorite books for middle-school readers.	2001-02-23

Almost on a whim, he and his wife decide to move to Tuscany, uprooting their former life and relocating before they have found a house or learned much of the language. Luckily, as a writer and artist, respectively, Ferenc and Candace both have work that travels easily. <br />The two wade through the notorious Italian bureaucracy involved in searching for and purchasing a house, eventually finding and settling into an idyllic farmhouse. Ferenc and Candace gradually adapt to their new home, adjusting to life in Italy with the help of friendly neighbors and townspeople. <br />The joy the Mates feel is contagious, though tinged with jealousy in my case. Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of this book is the couple's love for one another, blossoming in this beautiful setting and radiating from every page. A gorgeous tribute to a lovely place.	2001-02-22

Are they okay? Are they getting enough to eat? Is someone there when they need help? How would I know if they had problems at home?<br />Tish Bonner is the kind of student it's easy to overlook: quiet, seemingly bored in school. Yet her life at home is troubled. Her depressed mother spends most of her time at home, yearning for her estranged husband, who abandoned the family. Tish must take on the responsibility of supporting the family, including her young brother.<br />Tish hides her problems from the world, confiding only in the journal that began as an assignment for English class, but expanded beyond mindless homework to become an outlet for her emotions of sadness and desperation. Unfortunately, Tish marks every entry &quot;do not read,&quot; preventing her teacher from understanding her situation and providing help. Tish's diary entries are increasingly panicked and worrisome, as the condition of her situation at home deteriorates. <br />Haddix does a great job of taking the reader into Tish's thoughts, and creating suspense as we wait for her to reach out to someone. A recommended book for middle school aged readers and their teachers.	2001-02-22

But who wouldn't, given what he's been through?<br />His mother is dead, murdered years before by his father, who is now serving time in prison. Max lives with his grandparents in a basement room, rarely emerging from his &quot;down under&quot; world because he thinks he's too huge and too stupid to function.<br />When Kevin moves next door, though, Max's life begins to change. Kevin, also thirteen, has the body of a young child but the brain of a grownup. The two become friends and allies, combining their strengths and uniting as &quot;Freak the Mighty.&quot; Max has the muscle power, while Kevin has the imagination (and teaches Max to unlock his own). The two embark upon various hilarious and suspenseful adventures, culminating in a kidnapping and a daring rescue.<br />The best part of the book, besides the terrific story of a friendship, is the writing style. Narrated by Max, the story reads like an eighth grade boy's monologue -- conversational, funny, and instantly appealing. <br />This book is a real treasure.	2001-02-20

He advertises for a wife and gets Sarah, plain and tall (and smart and fun). She agrees to stay and take care of Papa, Caleb, and Anna, although she misses the Maine coast where she grew up. <br />The plot, like life on a 19th century farm, moves slowly and simply along. I was suprised and touched to learn how eager the children were to make Sarah happy and comfortable in her new life. <br />The story was very short and easy to read, and would be of interest to children in elementary school.	2001-02-20

His personally designed, luxury-style balloon crashes on the island of Krakatoa.<br />There on the island, which seems completely isolated from the outside world, live a group of incredibly wealthy diamond speculators who have left western civilization behind and created a society of their own. Their world is occupied by terrific time-saving inventions and a unique system of communal living. One example of their lifestyle: the families, who were re-named A-Z when they moved to Krakatoa, alternate the hosting of meals each day. The cuisine matches their letter of the alphabet (the C's specialize in Chinese food, for example).<br />The islanders, eager to keep their fabulous wealth to themselves, have vowed never to leave. That is, until a volcano erupts, forcing all to abandon the island in a contraption made of 21 air balloons. The eruption of Krakatoa was an actual historical event, though the island was thought to be uninhabited. The addition of history into this fantastical story is a pleasant touch.<br />This imaginative adventure was a lot of fun.	2001-02-17

Yet even in this tiny hamlet, the children are immersed in the images and language of the war. They have divided themselves into two camps -- Allies, for those in power, and Axis, for the outcasts.<br />Dawny, the narrator, is aligned with the &quot;Japs.&quot; He and his motley crew of associates plot to overthrow the Allies, local bullies who have long oppressed them. What starts as a game begins to grow more serious as the stakes get higher and the maneuvers riskier. <br />Suddenly a group of GIs arrives. They plan to use Stay More and its environs to carry out war exercises. The soldiers, who grew up all over the country, infiltrate the town, associating with and befriending the locals, and changing many of them, including Dawny. The soldiers' arrival makes the encroachment of the &quot;outside world&quot; more imminent in a town with just one radio.<br />I really enjoyed the pacing of the narrative and the appealing characters in this book. The ending left me very confused, though, and dampened my enthusiasm for the book.	2001-02-15

His mother doesn't understand him either, and rationalizes his father's behavior with lame excuses. When Ian begins growing a giant pair of wings, he becomes even more alienated from his family. <br />At first, Ian sees the wings as an embarrassing encumbrance, but under the guidance of two caring friends, Maggie and Miz Hawkins, he starts to see how this source of angst can also cause great joy and liberation. In short, Ian learns to fly in both the literal and figurative sense.<br />A few factors prevented me from enjoying this book as much as I wanted to. First, Brittain's prose is wooden and flat; not even the flying scenes come alive. Also, character development is lacking; even the &quot;good&quot; characters never advance beyond cartoon-like composites of two or three traits. The &quot;bad&quot; characters, such as Ian's father, are so despicable that I had to wonder why Ian even cares what they think. <br />Which brings me to my biggest disappointment: Ian's choice concerning the wings. Ian is willing to sacrifice his own happiness for the sake of people who hardly seem to care about him. Why?	2001-02-14

The boy's father, a sharecropper, struggles to support his family, but can't always provide for their needs. When he comes home with an entire ham, the family is suspicious, and no one is surprised when the police come looking for him. The police lead away the father, in the process shooting and wounding his coon dog, Sounder.<br />Nobody expects that Sounder will survive, the same as most would doubt the boy's survival in such an existence of poverty and despair. Yet the dog does survive, and so does the boy. Both display a resilience made all the more amazing by the deprivation of their backgrounds.<br />The boy, who visits his father in prison, meets a kindly teacher who becomes a sort of foster father. The boy learns to read and write, tools he needs to become empowered and to escape his desperate situation. While Armstrong doesn't give any false hope -- we know that the boy will face many more difficulties -- he makes the book a testament to the power of the human spirit to overcome despair and, ultimately, to triumph.	2001-02-04

His musical inclination results in big trouble when he is kidnapped and taken to work on a slave ship. His job on the ship is to play the fife while the slaves are forced to &quot;dance,&quot; supposedly to keep their bodies strong.<br />Jesse, who has never given much thought to slavery, recoils at the treatment of the slaves, treatment that was typical for its time, I suspect. Paula Fox does an especially good job of delving into the psyches of the men who voluntarily serve on the ship's crew, people who are not evil by nature, but whose constant rejection of the horror of slavery has inured them to normal human emotion. <br />A shipwreck during the book's course leads towards a somewhat dubious conclusion. For the most part, though, Fox skillfully carries us into the experience on the ship. We smell the stench, feel the claustrophobic crowding, and experience disbelief and outrage right along with Jesse. This book is a reminder of the unspeakable horrors that people -- even so-called decent people -- can inflict upon each other.	2001-02-03

Then Aunt May dies, plunging Ob and Summer into unrelenting sadness.<br />A classmate of Summer's, the eccentric Cletus Underwood, convinces Ob and Summer to embark on a journey to visit a medium he has read about. They agree and begin a trip, several hours by car. Somewhere along the way, they learn to accept the past and embrace the future.<br />Rylant, who won a Newbery Medal for this book, uses a gentle touch to tell this quiet story. She develops her characters by dropping subtle hints through their words and actions. She also incorporates rich seasonal symbolism. Yet, something about this book just didn't work for me. Perhaps I kept waiting for something to happen, some epiphany that never arrived. Though I could appreciate Rylant's craft, I didn't come away from the book feeling awed, but rather lulled and somewhat disappointed.	2001-01-21

And what letters! These are no slapdash, catty-chatty constructions, but rather articulate, vivid, thoughtful epistles between two people living very different lives in the 1990s.<br />The letters are real; they are the products of former Yale roommates Kate Montgomery and Hilary Liftin. Kate, recently married, moves to Kenya with her husband to teach English for the Peace Corps. Her narrative of life in Africa begins with stunned delight (giraffes walk by!). Increasingly, though, her letters begin to detail the awful conditions and debasement of the people there. We learn of rampant disease (Kate seems to catch every one of them), polluted water, and unsanitary schools where students are beaten mercilessly. <br />Hilary, from the other side of the ocean, relates her experience as a single woman looking for love, satisfying work, and a decent apartment in New York City. Her stories are funny, poignant, sometimes heartbreaking, and just as interesting as Kate's.<br />The best story of all, though, is that of the friendship that sustains and enriches these two passionate women across the miles.	2000-12-14

Kenny's older brother, Byron, provides much of the hilarity, from his sub-zero mirror-kissing fiasco, to his ill-fated attempt to consume an entire bag of stolen cookies. However, some of Byron's stunts cross the line between innocent hi-jinks and juvenile deliquency, and the Watson parents decide to intervene. They arrange a trip to visit awe-inspiring Grandma in Birmingham, Alabama. The Watsons set off in their car, equipped with an Ultra-Glide record player and all the latest tunes.<br />Until three quarters of the way through the story, the tone remains lighthearted. Shortly after the Watsons arrive in Birmingham, though, Curtis changes gears. The event that causes this rather abrupt shift is the bombing which killed four young girls in a Sunday school class. The story's mood becomes dark as Kenny grapples with the deaths, and the existence of evil in the world. <br />Although I recognize the importance of including the serious event, I confess that I did not enjoy Curtis's writing as much after the change in tone. Overall, though, I really enjoyed this book for its fascinating characters and funny adventures.	2000-12-04

Yet out of such ugliness, she extracted great beauty in order to write this dazzling memoir. Despite Karr's dysfunctional childhood, her writing is completely devoid of woe-is-me whining or psychobabble.<br />Karr has a gift for spinning a tale, perhaps inherited from her father or honed at gatherings of his friends in &quot;The Liar's Club,&quot; a group that met to drink, play cards, and swap stories. And boy, the stories she tells! There's the stories about her mother's manic/pyschotic episodes, including one time when she set her children's belongings on fire, another time when she attempted to drive the family off a bridge, and a third time when she threatened her lazy husband with a gun. Karr also tells about her inconsistent relationship with her father, who suffered a difficult life but emerged, if not unscathed, then unbroken. <br />Most remarkable about the book, though, are not the amazing stories but the matter of fact, even at times hilarious tone in which they are told. The woman telling these stories is no victim; she is a survivor. A miserable childhood did not cause Mary Karr to surrender her spirit, but rather forged her in fire and made her stronger.	2000-11-15

She and her wealthy family had always felt removed from the war, until a knock came at the door one Sunday morning.<br />The Russians who had taken control of Poland were arresting Esther's entire family for the crime of &quot;capitalism.&quot; They were loaded into foul-smelling, crowded cattle cars and shipped all the way to a Siberian outpost. Once in Siberia, the whole family, including nine-year old Esther and her frail but feisty grandmother, were forced to toil in dangerous mines or to work outdoors in brutal weather. <br />As the days stretched into months, Esther and her family became accustomed to the harshness of their new lives. Their priorities changed; Esther learned to value things she previously took for granted, such as a day at the fair, a chance to attend school, and a costume party. <br />This true story (Esther Rudomin became Esther Hautzig) serves as a reminder that indignities and cruelty happen everywhere, and that the human spirit can be resilient enough to overcome any obstacle. Despite the deprivations she suffered, Esther matured into an articulate and vivacious young woman. <br />Although the story could perhaps benefit from some editing in its long middle sections, it is a solid introduction to an important part of history, told through the eyes of one who lived it.	2000-10-28

Two mayoral candidates represent each side of the coin.<br />Esther Cunningham, with thirty years in office, a passel of grandchildren, and a penchant for fast food, is facing a challenger in the latest race. Mack Stroupe, a hot dog vendor, promises progress and prosperity for the town if he is elected. It's a tough sell, but he wins many people over.<br />Something about the whole situation, though, sounds an alarm for Father Tim, town counselor and conscience. Is the mayoral race somehow connected to the mysterious Miami Development, the company that wants to purchase Sadie Baxter's mansion and turn it into a spa?<br />Changes of another sort are happening all over Mitford, and some are definitely for the better. For instance, Dooley Barlowe has developed into an ambitious young man, and is becoming more grounded, too, as Father Tim works to reunite his scattered family, one by one. Some changes are more chaotic, such as the opening of the Kavanaugh home to new residents, including Harley Welch and his surrogate daughter, Lacey Turner. And some changes, like most in life, are a mix of good and bad, such as Father Tim's impending retirement.<br />I read this Mitford book with as much pleasure as the previous three, and look forward to more.	2000-10-18

Her half-hearted approach to tasks at church disappoints the meddlesome, but well-intentioned, ladies of the church committee. <br />When her husband is turned down for a much-needed promotion, Anna takes matters into her own hands. In order to raise money for her daughter's private school tuition and her son's road trip to India, Anna takes on a job at the local supermarket. To the consternation of the church ladies, the outrage of her husband, the embarrassment of her son, and her own personal delight, she keeps the job even after her money woes are lightened by the award of a scholarship to her daughter.<br />The job begins a broadening of Anna's perspective that extends beyond produce and canned goods. As she attracts both the notice and the desire of several men, she turns to one for the affection that is missing from her relationship with her husband. <br />Although it has its share of sadness and tragic turns, overall this is a story of personal growth and self discovery. Trollope's lucid prose and incisive characterizations make the book a pleasure to read.	2000-10-16

The unnamed narrator, possibly Paulsen himself, spends a glorious summer with relatives -- his uncle Knute, Aunt Clair, and cousins Glennis and Harris. Harris becomes the narrator's constant companion and partner in crime, through hours of intense farm labor, enormous and frequent meals, and non stop high energy play.<br />Some of the boys' pranks are a bit too slap-stick for my tastes, such as an incident involving urinating on an electric fence. And some characters, such as the dirty, mute farmhand who seems to inhale pancakes, are little more than cartoons.<br />What I remember most about the book, though, are its many funny moments -- Harris believing that a movie (which he has seen several times, no less) is really happening...ambushing the pigs...attaching a motor to a bike and zooming down the road. &quot;Harris and Me&quot; captures the long, carefree days of childhood with joy and zest.	2000-10-16

Yet, even with some structure in place, he is not completely equipped to deal with the academic and social pressures of the Ivy League life. Even some of the people in Cedric's own DC community do not approve of his efforts to become successful. <br />Suskind points out that minority scholarships most often benefit middle and upper class students, while people like Cedric, with an inner city, working class upbringing, rarely receive the kind of financial support necessary for a superior education. Little help exists for those who are truly &quot;disadvantaged.&quot; In light of how few supports he had, it is a true inspiration to read about Cedric's eventual success. <br />I hope that some of the anger at the disparities between rich and poor that this book arouses can be channeled into finding ways to help people like Cedric, and his less lucky peers.	2000-10-11

The path to love is rocky, though, and planted with obstacles, including the ferocious widow Edith, who is determined to sink her claws permanently into Tim, through such methods as good cooking and deliberate entrapment. <br />Tim's struggles of the heart are interspersed with his continued adventures as pastor and citizen of Mitford, including the growing pains of his foster son Dooley, and the unexpected arrival and protracted stay of his reclusive Irish cousin.<br />Throughout the book, Karon sends a hopeful, uplifting message without becoming syrupy. She incorporates a decidedly realistic portrayal of the confusion and uncertainty of new love with a subtle but unmistakable moral message that will do more for Christianity than a hundred sermons.	2000-09-30

For four British women, the attraction brings them to San Salvatore, a Tuscan villa, for an entire month of vacation.<br />The women are very different. Lotty Wilkins, nervous and talkative, is treated like a child by her husband and is starting to chafe from his oppression. Rose Arbuthnot, with a &quot;face like a disappointed madonna,&quot; is pious, sweet, and desperately unhappy. Margaret Fisher, stern and demanding, lives in a past peppered with famous literary encounters. And Caroline Dester, striking beautiful and popular, is lonely and bored with her whirlwind social life. <br />The four rent San Salvatore together, and immediately begin to change. Lotty loses her nervous demeanor, and becomes a self confident, mature woman. Rose blossoms when she realizes that she does possess beauty, and wins back the love of her formerly indifferent husband. Margaret thaws out and begins to smile and relax, even conversing with the other tenants, living in the present instead of the dusty past. And Caroline re-opens her heart to love and friendship by recognizing the emptiness of her life before she left for Italy.<br />What is it that changes these women? Sun and rest in a beautiful place? Yes, partly, but mostly it is the friendship of three extraordinary people.<br />I'd love to see this enjoyable novel brought back into print.	2000-09-27

They are four extraordinary sixth graders, possessing both brilliant minds and precocious insights into human behavior. They are the kinds of students that teachers feel lucky to encounter a few times during a career -- and Mrs. Olinski teaches all four during the same year! She recognizes their talent without exactly knowing why.<br />The four students form an incredible friendship centered around the ritual of Saturday tea, and, later, on an academic bowl team coached by Mrs. Olinski.<br />The book, which won a Newbery medal, had received some criticism for portraying twelve year olds with adult characteristics. It's true that their vocabulary and especially their insights boggle the mind. But I'd like to think that people like the Four Souls really exist, and, more importantly, that all children have flashes of brilliance that align them with the characters of this book.<br />The author's ingenious use of structure results in a perfectly balanced book, in which each of the children is given equal voice. These four people emerge from the sometimes ugly world of middle school, and, partially helped by and partially helping their teacher, they create of world of their own, where loyalty, creativity, and unusual thinking are the keys to happiness and self-discovery.	2000-09-21

For although Catherine is  purportedly writing a diary that encompasses the year 1292, she seems as  modern as any present day 15-year-old.<br />Everywhere she turns, Catherine  locks horns with the system that exploits her. She hates the needlework she  must complete -- and all the chores she must do! Catherine envisions a  number of &quot;glamorous&quot; careers -- artist, crusader, monk -- but  she is, of course, prevented from each one by her gender. Cushman uses the  metaphor of a bird to represent how Catherine feels -- free-spirited, but  caged in and flapping her wings against the bars of her societal  constraints. <br />The book contains many funny scenes, especially those  involving the ingenious plans Catherine devises to repel the suitors that  she hates. And, like Cushman's novel &quot;The Midwife's Apprentice,&quot;  the book contains a lot of historical information, particularly about the  less romantic sides of the Middle Ages (disease and unsanitary conditions).  <br />My main complaint about the book concerns its ending, when Catherine  suddenly and inexplicably abandons all her reservations about marriage and  consents to be engaged to a man she has never met. I would have enjoyed the  book more had Cushman found a way to build to the conclusion, or if she had  altered the ending completely. Sure, another outcome may have been  unlikely. But Catherine is an unlikely kind of girl.	2000-09-18

The heroine, who is nameless as well as homeless, uses the dung for heat, a  decision that Jane Sharp, the town's midwife, recognizes as a clever one.  Jane hires the girl and names her Beetle, for dung beetle.<br />Beetle is a  smart, compassionate girl, but a timid one, too. She allows Jane Sharp to  boss her around and the local boys to tease her mercilessly.<br />Karen  Cushman chose the England of the Middle Ages as a setting for the book, and  has researched the subject exhaustively. We learn about village life,  medicine, feudal structure, and the place of women in that society. Most  enjoyable to follow is Beetle's progress from a scared, meek little girl to  a self-assured young woman who has chosen her own name: Alyce.<br />While not  romanticizing Alyce's situation, Cushman makes it clear how much more is  available to her than to upper class women of her time. At the end of the  book, Alyce chooses her own future from several options. She selects the  life that will allow her the most independence. With a name and a career of  her own choosing, Alyce has come far indeed from the dung heap.	2000-08-24

Father Tim leads a quiet life.  That is until Barnabas the dog and Dooley Barlowe the pre-adolescent enter  his life, and he begins to develop a friendship with his neighbor Cynthia  Coopersmith, and countless professional and personal concerns intervene.  <br />The plot is interesting, but the book stands out for its likable,  true-to-life characters, and for the peaceful atmosphere that permeates it.  Father Tim, with his unflagging devotion to God, is an inspiration.<br />Jan  Karon's books have entered my canon of &quot;comfort reading,&quot; perfect  for a pick-me-up when I tire of the darkness and dysfunction of many modern  novels.	2000-08-23

Since then, I have returned to LaVaughn's story several times. Each  time, I experience the same sense of joy and awe at Wolff's ability to tell  a story, and to create sympathy without judging.<br />LaVaughn is an inner  city kid trying to make good by earning a college scholarship. Her  hardworking, firm-but-loving mom supports her, but urges LaVaughn to put  academics first. Jolly, a teenaged mom who has been roughly handled by  life, requests a babysitter, and LaVaughn responds.<br />Wolff makes us  question every stereotype we may hold: that teenaged moms brought their  problems upon themselves, that people who are out of work are lazy, that  every poor person is anxious to accept a handout. None of these  preconceived notions is true for Jolly or the other characters in the  novel. Yet, while painting every character with a sympathetic brush, Wolff  does not release any of them from responsibility. Life works out best, she  reminds us, for those that rise above the despair of a hard situation and  do something to make it better.<br />Wolff's free verse style creates strong  images of Jolly's life, both stark and joyful: the battered card where she  scrawls her desperate plea for help, the filthy floor in her apartment,  Jeremy's triumph at being toilet trained, the blooming of a lemon plant  that represents the hopes of children despite the harshness of their lives.	2000-08-21

He structures his treatise in seasonal form, with a series of menus  branching out into meanderings about food, travel, and family life. Through  his verbose ramblings, Tarquin reveals himself as a much more than he  suggests at first. In short, he has murdered his nanny, his parents, his  brother, his neighbor, and an acquaintance and her husband.<br />I had to  marvel at Lanchester's skill in setting up this story. Like the fish stew  that Tarquin describes so lovingly, the novel has layers upon layers of  density. Tarquin, the sociopath, knows exactly what he is doing, as he  subtly drops hint after hint about the killings. He draws attention to his  own cleverness in destroying life, since, to paraphrase his own words,  destruction is a higher art than creation.<br />This novel demands attention,  through its complicated sentences and erudite phrasing, as well as its  complex ideas and undercurrents. In the end, though, Lanchester, much like  his main character Tarquin, leaves the reader both awed and extremely  uneasy.	2000-08-21

The  story provides one possible answer.<br />Would we do the same thing as Hank  Mitchell, the narrator? After stumbling upon $4.5 million while in the  woods with his brother and the brother's friend, Hank concocts a  &quot;simple plan&quot; which will enable the three of them to keep the  money. If things go as planned, all the trio will have to do is wait a few  months, telling no one in the meantime about the money. Of course, the plan  falls apart, people end up dead, and the money becomes worthless.<br />The  premise of Smith's book rests upon the reader buying into the idea that he  or she would do the same thing. But I don't buy it. From beginning to end,  I found myself questioning every action of the characters. They all seemed  so pointless, and the more mired the Mitchells became in this impossible  situation, the less I sympathized. By the end, the Mitchells seemed not  regular people trapped in an inevitable situation, but inhuman, selfish  monsters.<br />To Smith's credit, he sure can tell a story and keep those  pages turning. The story was indeed engrossing, just not one I could  believe.	2000-08-18

My own reading of the book convinced me that the award was  well-deserved.<br />Billie Jo's poems span a period of years filled with  difficult experiences: poverty, unemployment, her mother's death in an  accident, her own maiming in the same accident, her trouble communicating  with her father. Her life is certainly not easy, her path almost never  smooth. Yet, the poems radiate such a hope, even a joy at times, that the  book never becomes depressing. <br />I think some of the images of this book  will stick with me for a long time -- the family chewing their dust-laden  milk, her mother's tent of pain, her father's smile at the dance, Billie  Jo's first concert after recovering from her burns. Billie Jo is a survivor  whose story is both thought-provoking and uplifting.	2000-08-18

His chosen turf is the &quot;north  country,&quot; the borderlands between the United States and Canada. Mosher  traveled from Maine to Washington, meandering a few miles one either side  of the border.<br />In this account of his odyssey, Mosher intersperses short  anecdotes from his life as a resident and traveler in these areas, combined  with mini-sketches of the people and places he encounters. Nobody and no  place merits more than three pages of Mosher's spare prose. Mosher voices  himself in the taciturn manner of the hardy border people. He strives for a  rough-and-ready effect, implying that his itinerary was haphazard, and that  his encounters were primarily ones of chance. I suspect that a lot more  planning went into the trip than Mosher suggests.<br />My favorite chapter was  the one on &quot;fresh starts,&quot; in which Mosher profiled people who  had left one life for another. For Mosher, traveling through places both  familiar and completely new was its own form of fresh start.	2000-08-17

They have differences in race -- Sara Kate is white,  while Clover is black -- and in background -- Sara Kate is a highly  educated, cultured city girl, while Clover has lived all her life in rural  Round Hill, South Carolina. Clover's beloved Aunt Everleen is also none too  fond of the newcomer she views as an intruder in their close knit family.  Over time, though, the characters learn to adapt to each other. The  transition from strangers to family is subtly told, and remarkably moving.  <br />Sanfers, who grew up in a rural South Carolina town much like Round  Hill, and still manages her family's fruit stand there, tells Clover's  story in a series of non-linear vignettes. This technique results in some  confusion: a character that was dead two pages ago will suddenly resurface,  alive. I can foresee that this jumping around would especially confuse  younger readers, the target audience of this book.<br />I also have my doubts  about the voice of Clover. She is perhaps the most mature, self aware ten  year old I have ever encountered in literature or in life. Despite these  flaws, though, this book is a strong story, beautifully written.	2000-08-08

He piles words on top of words, images on top of images, flinging them all at the reader with a fastball pitch. The pitch, though, is well-thrown. <br />Wolfe's  subject is New York City during the 1980s. He touches as many groups as he  can -- wealthy Upper East Side socialites, tabloid journalists, criminals  and burnt-out agents of justice in the Bronx, cut-throat sleazy lawyers,  unscrupulous Wall Street stockbrokers... No class of people escapes having  its faults exposed in Wolfe's sharp, accurate prose.<br />Wolfe is sociologist  first, novelist second. He probes the psychology of all these disparate  groups and finds a common denominator: selfishness. All people are out for  themselves no matter who is destroyed along the way.<br />At the same time he  satirizes the dark side of the human experience, Wolfe makes it impossible  to hate any of the characters. There is no true villain in this story. As  readers, we are left with just the uncomfortable sensation of recognizing  human nature's ugly parts.<br />&quot;How much differently would you act in  this situation?&quot; is Wolfe's implicit question. There are no easy  answers.	2000-07-29

It is a place of beautiful contrasts -- stone eroded into unusual formations, standing red against a bright blue sky. Unfortunately, the park was experiencing difficulties  associated with a skyrocketing number of visitors: destruction of trails,  traffic congestion, parking shortages.<br />Edward Abbey was a ranger at  Arches Park during the 1960s, before a single paved road traversed the  park, when it was an entirely different place. &quot;Desert Solitaire&quot;  details his season spent in the wilderness, when he grew increasingly  familiar with the power, beauty, and intensity of the Utah desert. His  writing, much like the landscape, possesses a captivating depth and  clarity.<br />Sadly, Abbey foretold that his book would be an elegy to a place  that would cease to exist. The Arches Park that he wrote about with such  passion has disappeared, replaced by the colassal traffic jam he  prophesized.

My confusion over many parts of the book led me to wonder whether something was lost in the translation. But I can hardly  imagine this crazy story making sense in ANY language.<br />Set in the future,  its premise is that people undergo many reincarnations and must continually  come into contact with the same people until they resolve any problems with  their relationships. Esquivel invents countless innovations and concepts --  virtual TV, body switching, regression to previous lives through music,  thought-reading computers, computers that interfere with thought-reading  computers...<br />Often while reading I had the feeling that Esquivel wrote  herself into a corner, then created a goofy new invention or outrageous  plot twist in order to extricate herself. Piled on top of a wildly spinning  plot is a new-age philosophy concerning the law of love -- something about  radiating peace, a pyramid, and crystals. <br />Perhaps this book's secret is  not to take anything it says seriously, but rather to sit back and enjoy  the wild ride.	2000-07-22

Her Japanese father died when Kim was a toddler, after he had  severed ties with his family in order to marry a white woman. Kim's mother,  since remarried, rarely speaks of her first husband, especially the years  he spent as a child, interred in a prison camp during World War II.<br />Kim  (whose Japanese name is Kimi, hence the book's title) sets off on a journey  in search of her father's family. The search doesn't result in a cliched  happy reunion. Like real life, Kim's quest and its result are much more  complex than that.<br />Throughout the book, Kim's addiction to serial romance  novels is highlighted. The authors include &quot;excerpts&quot; from these  cheesy novels to point out how different people's lives really are from  these silly fantasies. As Kim notes, not everyone in real life has pretty  eyes, shiny teeth, and problems that go no deeper than pimples.<br />I like  this book for incorporating history in a non-textbook sense. True, the  sections that mention the prison camps tend to get a little didactic, with  many long speeches from survivors. Overall, though, this book was enjoyable  both as an entertaining coming-of-age story and a painless history lesson.	2000-07-22

Finch possesses a power that makes  it possible to converse with the departed and to observe their behavior,  but not to touch them.<br />The dead include Lucy Armour, the suicide victim  who teaches Finch to have patience and to forgive, William Blott, the  closet cross-dresser who discovers, in death, an ability to nurture others,  Finch's mother, whose guilt over the accident that burned Finch has caused  her to withdraw into herself, and Finch's father, who still comforts and  protects his daughter. <br />Sheri Reynolds writes in a simple, accessible  style replete with imagery. Her messages are clear and beautifully stated:  people must connect with others in order to grow, and let go of past hurts  in order to avoid bitterness. Despite the problems that Finch faces, the  book resonates with optimism.	2000-07-20

Umarried and orphaned, Valancy has never experienced any form of love in  her life. For a woman of the 1920s, then, she has had no life to speak of.  Without friends, without happiness, without a future, Valancy decides to  change her whole way of thinking and enjoy her final months of  living.<br />The results are spectacular. Valancy accepts a position as a  nurse/housekeeper for a dying schoolmate, then proposes marriage to the man  she loves, the mysterious recluse Barney Snaith. She alienates her prissy,  begrudging, snobbish family in the process, but doesn't mind since they do  not deserve her respect in the first place. <br />During the course of the  story Valancy blossoms from an &quot;old maid&quot; to a loving, lovable  woman who has a purpose to her life. Montgomery fills the story with humor  and sympathy, and with a feeling of hope. Through Valancy, she shows that  is possible to escape even the most constrictive, unhappy situation and  find real joy.	2000-07-20

A spunky, intelligent heroine, Charlotte isn't afraid to get callouses on her pretty hands despite her high-class upbringing.<br />The  story, with several astonishing plot twists, kept me hooked for more than  200 pages.   Avi provides pictures and explanations to help readers  understand unfamiliar nautical terms. <br />I recommend this book to young  readers and others who would enjoy a gripping sea adventure with a strong  heroine.	2000-07-19

His gentle humor and thoughtful insights  translate well into print form.<br />In &quot;Piano Lessons,&quot; Adams  conveys the attraction of music, even for those of us who have little  experience or talent in producing it. He details the course of a year in  his life, a year when he decided to invest in a piano and learn to play it.  Adams mainly used self-teaching methods, but also participated in a session  with a private teacher and attended a week long music camp.<br />Besides  chronicling the routines of practicing and acquiring a greater familiarity  with the instrument, Adams' book branches off to cover other aspects of his  life during the time, and a sizable amount of history of the piano and of  notable pianists, past and present. Those tangents are mostly interesting  and enjoyable, thanks to Adams' polished prose style.	2000-07-19

Whitney Otto's idea for this novel had some intriguing possibilities: to tell the stories of several women who sew in the same California quilting circle. The quilt becomes a metaphor for the women's lives, made of  different fabrics (experiences, personalities, thoughts, actions...) but  surprisingly harmonious when woven together by the quilters (the  storyteller).<br />Otto approaches the individual women's stories by devoting  a section to each one. She tells each story in the third person (I think  first person might have been more effective). Each section is preceded by  &quot;instructions&quot; where the author addresses each character by  comparing her life to some aspect of quilting. Those instructions adopt a  rather condescending tone with such remarks as &quot;ponder the meaning of  marriage in the late twentieth century&quot; (paraphrased).<br />None of the  characters appears to change or grow much during the course of the novel,  though it's difficult to tell since each section is so short. The ultimate  conclusion that the young observer Finn draws -- that marriage isn't  perfect but that she hopes her own is &quot;wonderful,&quot; left me  dissatisfied and asking &quot;what else?&quot;	2000-07-19

All of these issues appear in microcosm in two Michigan towns -- St. Joseph's, predominantly  white, affluent, safe, attractive, and on the &quot;other side of the  river,&quot; Benton Harbor, predominantly black, crumbling, drug-infested,  crime-ridden. A single event, the disappearance of a Benton Harbor teenager  who was later found dead in the St. Joseph River, forced people from both  towns to confront problems that had been building for many  years.<br />Kotlowitz took great measures to explore the case at length,  interviewing many people from each town, analyzing the evidence in police  reports, even taking a boat down the river himself to examine the question  firsthand. His clear, uncluttered prose style complements his thorough  reporting methods.<br />Despite his painstaking investigation, though,  Kotlowitz was not able to determine the cause of Eric McGinnis' death,  accident or murder. There are no definite answers, he concludes, but the  infinite number of possible interpretations reminds us how complicated the  issues really are.	2000-07-18

Nick Bantock fills the pages with lavish art, often in inventive forms such as collage, letters,  and fold-out inserts.<br />On top of the fascinating, appealing artwork,  though, Bantock includes an interesting story line. As in the Griffin and  Sabine stories, the plot line of &quot;The Forgetting Room&quot; has a  haunting dark side. Bantock explores the nature of the artist and the  intensity of the relationships that artists tend to form.<br />Bantock also  sets up a kind of game for the narrator, and the reader, to play. The game  itself is ultimately more compelling than the answer. Armon, the main  character, eventually discovers that he must confront the personal demons,  or duende, of his own past and the past of his grandfather, before he can  fully recognize his own identity as an artist.  Unravelling the mystery  behind the past is an intriguing process, made enjoyable by the beauty of  Bantock's artwork.	2000-07-17

Stegner's  book was compelling enough that I wanted to return to the book whenever I  had to put it down, and I missed the characters when I finished. I not only  know people like Sid, Charity, Sally, and Larry, I feel as if I know these  specific people. <br />One of the central messages of this book, (and Stegner  does not hide his messages, but rather weaves them into the story and  repeats them often) is that life can be cruel, but that the love of friends  and family helps to ease the pain. The people that love us help us to cross  to the safety of happiness.	2000-07-15

This memoir explains why.<br />When Ellroy was ten, someone strangled his mother and left her body in a car. Her killer has never been found.<br />The memoir documents Ellroy's life  before and after the murder. In denial at first, he escaped into a life of  drugs and crime. Later, Ellroy dropped the lifestyle, but maintained a  fascination with crime, especially murdered women such as the famous  &quot;Black Dahlia.&quot;<br />Ellroy's writing style swings between two  extremes. At times he writes with the cool detachment of a detective. For  example, he describes in extensive detail the murder scene and the state of  his mother's violated body, reporting much as a uninvolved coroner might  do. This unemotional style, Ellroy explains, was one method he developed to  cope with his mother's death. <br />In other parts of the memoir, though,  Ellroy departs completely from this eerie detachment. He invites the reader  into his &quot;dark places,&quot; the ugly parts of himself that most  people keep hidden. These scenes are some of the most intensely personal,  and powerful, in the book. By writing about dark emotions and dark  experiences, Ellroy is able to move past them.<br />Part of the memoir focuses  upon Ellroy's attempts, thirty years later, to track down the truth about  his mother's life and death. Truth about others, much like the truths about  self that Ellroy explores earlier in the memoir, prove difficult to grasp.	2000-07-13

Thernstrom details the haunting story of a troubled Harvard undergraduate who murdered her roommate. Both young women  were immigrants from poor families who had risen above their backgrounds to  gain admission to what is probably the most prestigious American school.  Their similarities ended there, though. <br />Sinedu, the killer, who  committed suicide shortly after stabbing her roommate, was alone in  America. She lacked any network of close confidantes, or any skills to form  friendships. She had approached the Harvard administration for help with  her mounting academic and emotional problems, but her requests resulted in  no real aid. <br />Thernstrom does a thorough job of investigating the  backgrounds of both Sinedu and Trang, the roommate who earned universal  admiration for her kindness, industry, and friendly manner. <br />Perhaps the  book contains a bit too much self-indulgence, though. Thernstrom agonizes  too often over whether she should be writing the story at all. In the end,  though, she reaches the sound conclusion that her investigation, and  others, can only go so far. Sinedu's mind, and whatever motivated her final  actions, will always be a mystery. We can only wonder, and grieve at the  waste.	2000-07-11

Capote's technique of interweaving facts with embellished details was  innovative for its time. He fills in what he obviously can't know, such as  the thoughts of the soon-to-be-murdered victims. <br />Since this book's  publication, many imitations have followed, but &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;  still stands out.<br />What Capote does best is the cultivate an interest in,  and even sympathy for, all involved, not just the murdered Clutter family  and their grieving friends, but also their two murderers, especially the  sensitive soul, Perry Smith.<br />Capote is a master of his form. As any  writer does, he manipulates the slippery truth, pinning down one version of  reality that will remain in the minds of readers.	2000-07-11

I'm glad that I didn't.<br />Despite the  misery of his childhood, McCourt's memoir includes a number of lively and  humorous vignettes. Two of my favorites are his the account of his attempts  at Irish dancing, and the hilarious description of Frank's ill-fated first  Communion. <br />Nevertheless, McCourt does not mask his anger at the  institutions that failed him and his dyfunctional family. School teachers  (with one exception) were uninspiring, church people shut the door in his  face or expected the poor to grovel for handouts, government officials  lacked empathy. <br />McCourt doesn't fall into the trap of  over-generalization, though. Most people, despite their flaws, have their  redeeming qualities in McCourt's account. Most notably, his hard-drinking,  criminally irresponsible father also told beautiful stories, regaling Frank  with tales of Irish heroes. No hero himself, McCourt's father passed his  gift for telling an enthralling story to his son.	2000-07-11

She perfectly conveys the atmosphere of a Catholic church, and of the rural  Wisconsin town where most of the story's action takes place.  &quot;Action&quot; is perhaps the wrong word, since much of what happens  concerns inner struggles and relationships between members of a family in  which much goes unsaid.<br />This is a story told in gaps and silences. Just  as Sam disappears, leaving no clues, much of what occurs in the novel  remains hidden, unexplained. Ansay's spare, minimalist style enhances the  themes of the haunting story she tells.	2000-07-11

McBride's mother raised twelve fantastically successful  children despite enormous obstacles. Unfortunately, McBride seems to value  resume-type accomplishments more than ones of character. He tells us every  degree earned by his brothers and sisters, but very little about them as  people. What type of personalities do they have? Who are their families?  What are their passions? I would have liked to have known.<br />McBride takes  a removed stance, as if it were somebody else's family that he was assigned  to report on. His background in journalism may help explain the odd  distance McBride maintains. <br />In the end, I knew a lot about the details  of his mother's life, but little of her inner existence. Perhaps this  limited amount was all that McBride could tell. Perhaps all we really know  about people is what they present to the outside world. Despite the  altnerating points of view (McBride alternates chapters as \\"himself\\" and  \\"his mother\\") McBride never climbs far enough into his mother's head to  make her seem real to me.<br />My favorite scene: McBride's mother speaks at a  church celebration/reunion. Overcome by emotion, she throws away her notes  and speaks ad lib, from the heart. I wish that McBride had followed her  lead when writing this book.	2000-07-10

Both qualities  were lacking in this book.<br />Page after page chronicled the mishaps in the  life of a manic-depressive woman (weeks in bed, followed by deliberately  running into a woman with her car), as told by her daughter. I would rather  have heard the story from the woman herself. What was running through her  head as she pressed that gas pedal? What, in her mind, was the reason for  her seemingly miraculous recovery, and her even more miraculous, instant  reconciliation with her daughter?<br />A subplot that seems only somewhat  related focuses upon the narrator's grandfather, an overbearing bully who  keeps everyone except his daughter at a distance.<br />Overall, a well-meaning  book that could have benefited from substantial revision.	2000-07-10

I  finished the book with a real affection for this character, drawn so finely  and so lovingly by a truly masterful writer.<br />I had seen the movie version  starring Gywneth Paltrow before reading the book. I expected to read the  entire book with Paltrow's raspy laugh and swanlike neck in mind. Yet  Austen transported me away from my cinematic preconceptions. There is so  much more to &quot;Emma&quot; than a movie can capture: the incisive social  commentary, the near perfect grasp of human nature, which hasn't changed  much since Austen's time, in all its ugliness and sublimity.<br />There has  been much discussion over why Austen remains so popular with readers today.  After all, her characters are geographically and socially isolated,  immensely concerned with money, and (with a few exceptions) have no  discernible occupations other than hunting for mates. It is hard to find  similarities between these lives and those of modern Americans. What Austen  does so well is to depict her particular place and time with astonishing  clarity. Through Austen's (and Emma's) eyes, we see the commonalties that  exist among all people, no matter the time or place.	2000-07-10

She presents a series of fragmented snapshots, strings them together, then expects the reader to do much of the interpretation. The result: a grim, relentless,  despairing mosiac of a life in the process of falling apart.<br />I have  admired Didion's non-fiction (&quot;White Album,&quot; &quot;Slouching  Towards Bethlehem,&quot; &quot;After Henry&quot;) for her adroit use of  language: her skill in putting together words that pack in a maximum amount  of powerful imagery, the way her phrases implant themselves in my thoughts  and remain there.<br />While &quot;Play It As It Lays&quot; demonstrates some  of that same skill with language that is evident in Didion's journalistic  work, I doubt that the story of Maria will cling to me like the stories of  people from Didion's essays: the abandoned child on the highway, clinging  to the cyclone fence, the neglected flower child rocking on a rocking  horse.<br />A day after I read &quot;Play It As It Lays,&quot; I wondered if I  had dreamed it. Not so for Didion's non-fiction. In that case, I wondered  if I had lived it.	2000-07-10
