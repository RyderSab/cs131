US	52959253	R1KOIMMCX2OPEB	0312932804	394302937	Welcome to Temptation	Books	4	3	6	N	N	4+ Wow!	I don't read romances (is this considered one?), but found this book at a library book sale. For 50 cents, it seemed an acceptable risk. <br /> <br />I really liked these characters, the story, & the town and was wowed by the hottest love scenes I've ever come across. If there were more men as skillful, funny, & caring as Crusie's lovers out there, you'd see scores of happy, smiling women all over the place. <br /> <br />Just one plot point that didn't gel for me is what kept the book from the total 5 star rating, but it's minor. <br /> <br />So it's not the great American novel and won't ever be considered literature, but it's just what's needed to sit back, relax, and enjoy. A book that's pure entertainment.	2005-04-22

I haven't disliked a book this much for quite a while. I also haven't returned a book to Amazon in over four years. Until now.  <br /> <br />Anyone who's ever been on a diet knows everything in the 3-Hour Diet. All the discussion about fats, proteins, and carbohydrates is elementary.  <br /> <br />What it comes down to is a calorie-restricted diet. Jorge gives people approximately 1400 calories a day. If we all ate 1200 to 1400 calories each day, most of us wouldn't have any weight problems. <br /> <br />While it probably is good to be able to eat at three-hour intervals, it is not practical for the majority of people. I realize overweight people don't usually eat on a schedule -- no matter what the majority believes, people with weight problems usually skip meals. But, this book gives no new insight. <br /> <br />(One person who writes a testimonial in the book actually says her colleagues remind her to eat when her watch alarm goes off. Wouldn't happen in any office I ever worked in -- how about you?) <br /> <br />Jorge takes up space: <br />1) bashing Atkins & low carb diets (others have done it better & the reader gets the idea he hasn't any idea of the intricacies of these diets -- he's just mouthing the party line) <br />2) numerous pages (62 of them/31 days) taken up with a daily mediations, pithy sayings from Jorge, and a chart to keep track of your food and water intake.  <br />3) a very, very short exercise section (gee, does he expect you to buy one or more of his exercise books? Naaah!) <br />4) recipes -- do you really need to pay $16 for more recipes? <br />5) food suggestion lists -- guess what? They talk against the same kinds of starchy carbs and high fat proteins the low carb diets do. <br /> <br />Jorge has a web site. You probably can get the same kind of information there, but it's not free. Sign up as a member and you can choose to pay $3 per week and get just about everything in this book. Go for the platinum membership ($12 weekly) & you canattend monthly live teleconferences and some other stuff. <br /> <br />OK, one sort-of-good thing in this book -- fast food suggestions. If you like to or have to eat out at a fast food restaurant, there are suggestions for food you can order that stick with this plan. But, then, you dieters out there probably already know how to do that, too. <br /> <br />All this information, and much more, is easily found free on the Internet. Pass on this book.	2005-04-05

The newest edition is just as useful now as their first one was years ago.<br />Long, long ago ... before the Internet ... planning your wedding was a local endeavor where you were at the mercy of Bridal Show exhibitors. If you were lucky, you could get truthful information from couples who'd already gone through the process. If you were lucky.<br />Bridal Bargains took the secrecy out of wedding planning and exposed it to the light of common sense and economic forces.<br />This book is the first one I recommend to the wedding planning classes I teach, the first one I used myself, and the most comprehensive I've found to date.<br />Now they've added a plethora of web site addresses.<br />Yes, web sites come and go, but an afternoon spent flipping through the book and trying various sites (and I compared them with a few other books who provide web address information) found this book to have the highest number of 'live' addresses. When time is at a premium, this is an important factor.<br />I noticed that a previous reviewer wasn't happy with the amount of the book dedicated to buying a wedding dress. I can certainly understand that, but with the majority of brides purchasing from bridal shops, discounters, and major manufacturers, this information needs to be exhaustive.<br />In the 22 years I've been 'doing' weddings, I have had less than 15 brides have dresses specially made for them, perhaps another 12 who wore suits or a dress not designated as 'bridal', and maybe 9 who wore a dress belonging to a Mom, Grandmother, or other family member. Denise &amp; Alan's emphasis on dress manufacturers reflects the reality of the market.<br />All in all, this is a book well worth the price. Use it and save yourself time, money, and stress.	2004-05-13

It works on many levels and for multiple age groups.<br />Each page features a letter of the alphabet along with an appropriate sea creature or sea subject. For example: \\"Ff is for fish.\\"<br />Nothing different here, is there?<br />Well, yes, there is. One page starts with the featured letter and the next page begins with a beginning word. \\"Gull begins with Gg.\\" The pages alternate that way throughout the book.<br />Along the bottoms of the pages are sentences like: \\"Fantastic fish float with fins\\" or \\"Sea gulls glide in gusty gales.\\"<br />These sentences, as with all the others, allow an older child to read to a younger one, allow any child to build his vocabulary, and keep this book from getting stale.<br />The alphabetic glossary in the back contains the pronunciation of selected words and their definitions.<br />Another feature is the page borders. Pictures surround the pages with sea horses, turtles, life preservers, canoes, and lobsters, to name a few. If you'd like, you can use the edge pictures to count. You can count total items in some pictures or pick out items that are the same or different.<br />The other thing I noticed is that each page has some action. Dolphins play with balls and rings, gulls fly in the sky, a ship heads for harbor in a stormy sea. The pictures aren't static.<br />As I've said, this book works on many levels and is one your child won't outgrow too soon.	2002-10-26

Get this book!	When my husband &amp; I bought a house recently, it came complete with a man-made pond, stream, and waterfall.<br />I borrowed every book about ponds and water features from the library. They didn't own The Master Book of the Water Garden. Too bad. This is the most complete book on the subject I've come across.<br />To begin with, it has wonderful pictures and makes a great coffee table book, even if you're not looking for water garden information.<br />There are two indices: one that's general and one that's specifically for plants. Throughout the book are \\"Problem Solving\\" asides. Sometimes entire pages are dedicated to answering questions about fish, plant depth, water quality, and much more.<br />But I thought its strength was the amount of very specific information on the subjects it covers. Other books dealt with just ponds, or waterfalls, or wet and dry streams. This book covers all that as well as fountains, water meadows, bogs, and containers.<br />Discussions include bridges, decking, walkways, lighting, filters, propagating plants, &amp; the various kinds of liners. Cleaning and maintaining the water feature is included, as well as seasonal upkeep. Designing your water garden, picking plants, choosing a location, &amp; deciding on size are just a few of the subjects covered. And fish subjects aren't limited to just koi and goldfish.<br />I was most interested in how to drain and repair a leaking pond. This has been difficult information to find. Swindells even tells you what to do with the fish while you're making repairs or changes to the pond.<br />My only criticism is that the plant index uses the Latin names for the plants. Though it does include common names, in many instances, if you're not sure what you're looking for, a specific plant may be a bit difficult to find. I must admit that there are full color pictures of the plants in the book, though my favorite water plant, horsetails, isn't included.<br />This book is already well thumbed and the pages wrinkled from where they've been wet. In other words, it's useful and used.	2002-10-15

I wait until someone with distance does justice to a life.<br />Soldier, though, is the exception to my rule. June Jordan is able to look back over what seems a chaotic and sometimes cold, cruel childhood, and put it into the context of her life.<br />The style is many times lyrical and poetic. The words draw you in and keep you reading. The story works back and forth between what's actually happening to June, the child, and what she's thinking about as it unfolds. It's quite different from most autobiographies.<br />While I understand her father's quest to make sure his child is never a victim, his methods seem too brutal for words. It was a different time, and reality for an African-American is different, too, but reading about it is grueling.<br />I did have a problem with the fact that June's memories seem much too clear. I may be missing the point, but I don't know anyone who can remember her childhood with such clarity and from the age of six months. Perhaps this is literacy license. If so, fine. The problem, then, is mine.<br />No matter, this book is a fabulous read. I whipped through it in two hours.	2002-10-13

If you love rich colors, you'll love this book.    If you're afraid strong color won't work in your spaces, one look at these rooms will change your mind.    Showcasing interiors using browns, blacks and grays, purples and reds, blues and greens `Mood Indigo' works with all shades from the strongest, darkest of the hues to the lightest.    There are tips on how to use strong colors, discussions about room size, light needs, finishes, textures, a short history of paint, pigments, and color trends.    Color is used not only on walls but in accessories, on fabric, floor coverings, lampshades ... well, just about anything you can think of.    Room designs run the gamut from country to traditional to eclectic to rustic. You'll see color used in hallways and kitchens as well as the more usual bedrooms, dining rooms, and living rooms.    Inspiration abounds. Add the fact that this is a great coffee table book, if nothing else, and you'll be happy you bought it. Everything about this book is quality.	2002-08-14

This book would be perfect as a wedding shower gift or for a housewarming -- man or woman.<br />As for context, this book covers just about every topic a young person needs to set up a new home or apartment. From organizing your 'stuff' to cleaning all kinds of surfaces, you'll find it here.<br />There are sections about entertaining, safety, manners, and trouble-shooting your furnace, water heater, and other systems.<br />Scattered on the left and right page edges are tips -- time savers, budget stretchers, household lessons, smart ideas, and more. They are included in the very extensive index. <br />The five-ring format allows you to remove and take pages to the hardware or paint store. It also lets you add any tips or hints you may find elsewhere.<br />If you are an experienced homemaker this book will be a little too basic for your needs. A better choice, if you're deep into the subject, would be &quot;Home Comforts&quot; by Cheryl Mendelson.	2002-07-27

There are entire sections on faux wood techniques as well as malachite, lapis, marble, tortoise shell, and granite. Sections on stenciling, gilding, glazing, and antiquing are included.<br />For some reason, I loved reading and looking through this book. Unfortunately, and this is probably my fault, I am not inclined to try any of this.<br />It looks like way too much work and too much time for the result. This could be because there are just so many faux wall &amp; surface treatments being shown in interiors I may just be tired of the whole thing.<br />But, if you're interested and want to know how to get started, what tools you'll need, and what the final results will look like, this book covers it well.	2002-07-27

My affair with this book is love-hate. <br />I never heard of Tracy Porter or her 'style' until the publisher sent me a beautifully designed shopping bag filled with catalogs showcasing her retail items and the gift of a personal teapot cum cup & saucer -- very clever.<br />The items from her retail line are much cleaner and more mainstream than the pictures in this book which purports to be from her home.<br />What Tracy does is give the reader permission to take things out of the 'keeping for good' closet and use them everyday. That's good.<br />What she also does, and I'm sick to death of it, is use items that have seen better days. If I see one more piece of distressed furniture or one more chipped painted chandelier I'm going to scream.<br />People -- reupholster your furniture!  If something's ripped, fix it. Unless your furniture sports real antique fabrics or finishes or is showing true wear and tear from daily use, repair it. Enough I say!<br />Tracy bravely uses color in her home. I do think there's too much of a mish-mash in many of the rooms, but that's my personal taste and not necessarily bad.<br />The other problem I have with this book is this home supposedly has three small (under 4 years old) boys living in it. Yet, there is pin a cushion on chair seat (a delight to the eye), a faux leopard throw hanging off a chest (on top of which sit four painted glasses and a matching glass martini shaker), lampshades with antique buttons hot-glued around the rim, and a dresser top filled with a letter opener, very, very small porcelain dolls, perfume bottles, and hat pins, to name a few.<br />I hope as soon as the photographer left Tracy ran through the house clearing off all these potential accidents waiting to happen.<br />There is a very short project section which gives instructions on how to make some of the items shown in the book. If you're a fan of decorating books, magazines, or shows you've seen them all before.<br />What I did appreciate is the resource directory at the back of the book. In alphabetical order it lists many of the places you can buy nice home design items. Where there is a web site available, it is included, so you're not forced to call.	2002-07-27

She uses examples from her own life & from her family to 'tell it like it is'.<br />There's no writing as though she's a guru on high dispensing wisdom that's nothing more than theory.<br />When you read anything from Azriela, be it her books, web site, or newsletters, you get a very clear picture of the woman behind the words.<br />\\"Starting from 'No'\\" is a workbook filled with self-tests, charts, checklists, worksheets, quizzes, tips, & strategies. Everything is backed-up with examples, stories, and real life experiences. The suggestions for working though problems are down-to-earth and do-able. No 'pie in the sky' for Azriela.<br />And the examples come from small business people, sales people, home-business owners, writers, consultants, coaches, and more. These are real people, like you & me, who have come up against the same fears, problems, & rejections & lived to tell about it.<br />Chapters cover:<br />=> fear of rejection & why rejection is just the word we use for fears of all kinds -- failure, success, humiliation, approval (or lack thereof), and more<br />=> how to make yourself rejection proof. What concrete things can you do to overcome the fear that cripples you?<br />=> what are your limits? Can you stretch them? Are you taking on more than you can handle & setting yourself up for failure?<br />=> the power of your mind. The only thing you have to fear is fear itself -- now who said that!?<br />=> resiliency & flexibility -- do you know when to hold fast & when to give in? Do you see yourself as a victim? Do you see negative situations as everyday occurrences, use them, & move on?<br />=> maintaining detachment -- take a step back & assess situations.<br />=> asking for referrals, building rapport, keeping yourself motivated, & knowing when to take a break.<br />=> staying in the game -- do you know the difference between temporary setbacks & when to throw in the towel?<br />Shall I go on with more examples? Nah. Just know there's much more.<br />I found so much useful information in this book. One section that caught my attention while thumbing through the book is what Azriela calls \\"The Jaffe 3-5 Rule\\".<br />Many of us were taught the '3-Foot Rule'. It means that anyone within 3 feet of you is a possible prospect.<br />Talk about pressure! I never could figure out how to bring up products while standing in line at the post office.<br />Azriela rejects this notion, too. Her '3-5 Foot Rule' has no pressure attached & reads like this:<br />\\"To prosper in your business, focus your efforts on no more than three to five major target markets, using no more than three to five primary marketing tools, and making the most of your three to five greatest business skills. Be sure you spend your time in three to five major business responsibilities, and if possible delegate the rest.\\" (p. 144)<br />You're not left in the dust after this statement. Azriela walks you through a step-by-step way to implement the idea so it'll work in your specific business & situation.<br />Then she shows you how to draw up a chart so you can see what needs to be done & then prioritize your tasks.<br />I'm not categorizing this book. It's not self-help, though it has those aspects. It's not strictly a management book, either.<br />Let's call it a success book.

When I started to read this book I realized just how much  we're saturated with stats every day.<br />I loved the example that showed how reporters can use government  statistics to arrive at outrageous headlines like: &quot;The Shocking  Increase in Cocaine Use.&quot;<br />Or what it means when educators say that all children need to perform  &quot;at grade level.&quot; Do you want your child to do so?<br />Do you run banner ads on your web site? If so, how do you count the  number of your visitors to reach the cost you charge?<br />Are you the biggest e-store in your specialty area? How did you come to that conclusion?<br />Do you remember any of the statistics you learned in school? Do you ever have use for them?<br />Well, this nifty little book gives great examples of how anyone can use statistics to prove their case.<br />But, what I really liked the most is that it's a quick read. Even if you're not a statistical genius, you'll easily grasp the various examples. It's short, to the point, and it's relevant.<br />Full of charts, graphs, illustrations, and cartoons the book covers everything you'll ever need to know about how statistics are used in the every day world.<br /> Some of what's covered includes:<br /> =&gt; using graphs to prove your point<br /> =&gt; how percentages can lie<br /> =&gt; when is average NOT average?<br /> =&gt; definitions that make your case<br /> =&gt; why making assumptions can make you fail<br /> =&gt; associations &amp; causation - how do they link?<br /> =&gt; confounding -- two or more ways to draw the same conclusion<br /> =&gt; sampling &amp; how to make it work in your favor<br /> =&gt; measurement - can you get the same results more than once?<br /> =&gt; the big picture - how to use many smaller studies to reach your conclusion<br />Am I telling you to skew numbers to prove your point? No, but you should be aware of how others are doing just that. In the long run it might save your sanity as well as your pocketbook.<br />My only negative comment -- the price could be a little lower.	2001-03-28

Many people have,  but most don't have any idea where  to start. Jan Stankus's book will  tell you everything  you'll need to know whether you have one spare room or  six.    I admit I was thinking about the possibility of buying  a larger house  than we can afford and putting the unused  space to use as a B&B. I  needed information, but surfing  the Internet was a long and time  consuming job.    There is no web site that has the  plethora of information in this book.    This book is very well written. I actually sat down with  it and read  most of it straight through, like a novel.  The index is so good you can  easily go back to the topics  you'll need if you pursue the B&B route.    Stankus doesn't pull any punches when she tells what's  involved in  owning and operating a B&B. I found out things like:     * the difference between a B&B and an inn     * safety concerns for yourself and your house     * zoning issues and ordinances     * insurance, fire laws, and other legal requirements     * furnishing and outfitting your home     * how to get in the guide books     * applying to and using an RSA (reservation service agencies)     * ways to market your B&B business     * what's involved in the B&B lifestyle     * your competition - how to find it and use it to your advantage     * how to price your rooms     * determining your start-up costs     * amenities - what are they and do you need them    Included are: some useful web sites; a state-by-state list  of the  RSA's; U. S. & Canadian tourist offices; and a  number of various work sheets.    Stankus also deals with issues such as allowing pets or  children as  guests, medical concerns, food preferences  and allergies.    There is enough information to give a reader a solid  background in how a B&B works.     Here are some other sources if you're enamoured of the  idea of a B&B:     * look for local or regional classes  (many times taught by owners of B&B's)...    As always, Globe Pequot's \\"How To\\" series is chock  full of useful  information, reasonably priced, and  delivers more than expected. I've decided B&B (or  innkeeping) isn't for me. But, if you want to explore  the option for yourself, I can't think of a better  book to start with.	2001-03-28

I don't normally write reviews for works of fiction, but this book deserves to be praised. The first thing that stands out about &quot;Quieter Than Sleep&quot; is the use of language. <br />Most mysteries and detective novels count on fast dialog to move the story along and to give the reader a sense of the characters. These books normally use short paragraphs and shorter sentences. They aren't always successful, either.<br />Dobson, instead, writes longer passages using the most wonderfully descriptive words. She sets scenes beautifully and allows her characters carry on internal dialogs with well-chosen words.<br />Don't think this bogs down the story or the momentum. It doesn't. The plot moves along at a good pace. <br />I felt that her characters were extremely well-defined ... more so than in most mysteries.  There's a real sense of who these people are and an understanding of why they act as they do. Their motives are clear.<br />The clues are there. A few red herrings lead you astray. Sub-plots keep your interest. Marry that with an academic setting, faculty in-fighting, New England staidness, and Emily Dickinson and you end up with a most excellent book.<br />It was quite a surprise to find out that this was a first novel for this author, it's that well done. I'm working my way through her other books. Dobson is well worth reading.	2001-02-16

This is my first book by Tamar Myers. It will be the last.<br />This plot is  so tangled and the characters so shallow I wonder how it was ever  published. Here's why I say this ...<br />The first chapter of the book says  it's October, but later on, in several chapters, Magadalena Yoder, owner of  the PennDutch Inn and the main character, says it's July.

It's  never clear.<br />Magadelena is Mennonite descended from Amish, but in a scene  when she meets up with two Amish children she answers them in English when  they address her in Pennsylvania Dutch, which she speaks. And the  children's grandfather refers to her as &quot;English&quot; their term for  all outsiders. <br />The woman lives in the community. Her family is Amish and  she's a practicing Mennonite. It doesn't make sense for her to be referred  to as &quot;English.&quot;<br />Magdalena's character is annoying. The woman  is supposed to be 45 years old, yet she constantly addresses people as  'dear'. &quot;Well, dear, it must be something you said.&quot; &quot;Yours  is a beautiful name, dear.&quot; &quot;So, dear, what do you know about  this Hemmy person?&quot;<br />Cut me a break! The only people I know who  address people as 'dear' are either bad waitresses or really old ladies.  When a 45 year old talks to people this way, it's downright stupid. <br />But  the clincher is that Magadelena figures out 'who done it' because the  character uses the words 'rubber band' instead of the Pittsburgh slang term  'gum band'. This proves the character couldn't possibly from Pittsburgh as  claimed.<br />I am a born and bred Pittsburgher and haven't used 'gum band'  since I was 8. Would that be a clue that I'm not who I say I am? For Tamar  Myers it is.<br />Take your chances, but I thought this book was a complete  waste of time and money. The editor should have been able to catch the  numerous discrepancies and mistakes. I wonder if it was ever read in its  entirety.	2000-08-30

I never burned my bra (heaven knows I need it to keep things where they belong!), but that doesn't mean I'm not a feminist. That said, I didn't know feminism precluded a clean, well-ordered environment.<br />The author of  this book is a lawyer &amp; professor. She has children. She works outside  the home. And she cleans. Cut her a break.<br />In her introduction Cheryl  Mendelson specifically states she is writing a 'reference' work. One that  would work equally well for beginners as well as for experienced  homemakers.<br />No where in this book does she say you have to do everything  she suggests or follow her lead. She's simply supplying the information.<br />Unless you live in a sty, everyone cleans. How much time you spend on  that activity is up to you. If there are tricks and short-cuts to make it  easier, all the better.<br />Since reading this book, I've have re-instated  many of the routines I used to have. What happened? I'm actually spending  *less* time on cleaning and straightening than before.<br />The only thing I  disagree with is the emphasis on disinfecting surfaces, bacterial  contamination, etc. I think we all need a few germs in order to build our  immune systems. Studies have shown that parents whose children are kept too  clean get ill more often.<br />Unless there is a person in your household who  is already immune compromised, I'd ease up on the sanitizing and  anti-bacterializing.<br />Many things have changed, but, unfortunately, women  are still judged on how their houses look. But, even if that wasn't true, I  doubt I'm the only one who still wants a clean, organized home, who likes  linens to smell fresh, who feels a sense of satisfaction in cooking  great-looking, good-tasting meals.<br />Being a feminist means being  yourself, living the way you want -- and allowing others to do the same.	2000-05-15

After  reading the entire book, you will come to see a sameness to the designs.  They look to my eye to be variations on the theme of craftsman/prairie  style.<br />The openness gets boring, as does the constant use of light walls  with light wood trims. There is a lack of color in these rooms that breaks  my heart.<br />You'll also notice a squareness to rooms, staircases, windows,  fireplaces, kitchen islands -- everywhere you look there is a rectangle or  a square. Very seldom (you can count them on one hand) will you see the use  of curves or circles.<br />And where is the practicality in having kitchens  opening into family rooms, living rooms, and eating spaces? Doesn't anyone  in these homes ever cook? <br />Even with the best exhaust systems, cooking  emits odors, deposits grease and oils into the air, mucks surfaces, and  requires constant upkeep. That's one of the reasons kitchens used to be  separated from the living spaces of the home. (OK, fire was another  reason)<br />Privacy is another issue.  Loft bedrooms that open to family room  spaces offer none, even though the author shows and suggests 'away spaces'  where one can close a door and go to be alone and quiet.<br />There is such a  thing as too much togetherness and houses like these have few places for  family members to get away from each other.<br />As a practical person I feel  the owners of these houses will constantly be cleaning because the very  openness doesn't allow for clutter or a mere closing of doors (since there  aren't very many!). <br />I suppose I was expecting more of a 'how to' book. I  want to know how to put storage under stairs, eke an extra few inches out  of a powder room, make use every inch of space in a kitchen, design  bedrooms with plenty of windows without givingup wall space.<br />As with  most things design, it's all a matter of individual taste. This style isn't  mine.	2000-05-15

I read this  whole book on a flight from Chicago to San Francisco. My laughing out loud  had passangers &amp; flight crew looking at me like I was some crazy  woman.<br />I've been going aroung for days saying &quot;Lo mein&quot; out  loud and laughing to my self. My husband read it as soon as I finished, and  he's also &quot;lo mein-ing all over the place.<br />If you've even thought  about what makes a person creative or a genius, this book will give you  plenty of food for thought.<br />I don't want to give away the plot, but let  me say the premise, as clever as it is, will offend some people. Suspend  belief and enjoy it for the good story it is.<br />And if you guess the  ending, I'll eat this review. It sure caught me by surprise.	2000-05-15

This is one of the most complete.<br />While Dr. Siegal is an obvious proponent of the idea that many people have undiagnosed thyroid problems,  you shouldn't rule out the possibility that he is correct in his  thinking.<br />If after you read this book, take all the tests, fill out the  checklists, keep track of your temperature, and try his 28-day eating test,  you don't think you got your money's worth, I'd be surprised. <br />The 28-day  part of the title is a way to evaluate your metabolic function. There is a  bit of math involved, but it's not especially difficult.<br />You use your  present weight, your weight on day 29, various charts that help you  calculate exactly how many calories you eat, how many you need to maintain  your weight, and a number of other factors that will, in the end, tell you  just how easy or difficult it is for you, personally, to lose  weight.<br />This book does not support any one way of eating: it's not low  calorie, it's not low fat, it's not low carbohydrate. It's not a diet book  at all. It simply calculates your metabolic functioning based on whatever  way you eat.<br />Dr. Siegal also gives strong arguments for the use of  natural thyroid supplementation as opposed to the use of  synthetics.<br />While some may find it too detailed, I think it's most  complete in its coverage of this topic. In a way, it takes a lot of what  other books have and presents all in one place. <br />The medical jargon may  be a bit difficult, but it's great information to take to your doctor.<br />By  the way, Dr. Siegal has a web site at: [...]<br />The book  also provides web URL's to a number of sites dealing with thyroid.	2000-04-08

Everything, if you believe Paul Clarke.    For those who might not know, Charlie Trotter's is an award-winning restaurant  located in Chicago.  I haven't yet been able to save up the $300 needed to  eat there, but, from what I hear, it's an experience you'll not soon  forget.    Back to the book -- this is a tough call.  I like it.  I hate it.   I can't make up my mind.  And maybe that's because it's almost like  reading three different books.    First, it's a semi-bio of Charlie Trotter:  his restaurant, how he runs it, his marketing strategies, his continual  quest for excellence, his ongoing mission to make the dining experience in  his restaurant extraordinary.    Secondly, it's an examination of how you  can apply the pursuit of excellence to your business.  Both these aspects  make it an interesting read.    Then there's this underlying, ongoing  discussion of having employees 'buy in' to your vision for your business.   Though Clarke emphasizes rewarding this loyalty, and Trotter does so, I can  say from my own experience, it just ain't so!    I found myself talking back  to Clarke as I read.  My husband thought I was going gaga.  But I was so  angry!    Much of what Clarke says feels manipulative to me.  When I was an  employee I was an excellent employee.  I was the one who came in early,  stayed late, did whatever it took, asked for more responsibility -- in  other words I played the game.    It seems as though all the suggestions  favor the employer rather than the employee.  And this is where I get  bogged down.  I'm torn.    As an employee, I was used & abused too many  times by the companies I worked for.  And I know I'm not the only  one.    But, as a small business owner, I'd want my employees to act exactly  as Clarke suggests.  It feels wrong, although I can't put my finger on  exactly why that is.    I suppose any book that elicits this kind of  response must be read.  That's my recommendation to you.  If you hate the  management advice, you'll love the discussions about food, wine, & the  restaurant experience.	1999-12-16

This is a personal  story of how she changed careers from social work to PR with the help of  many people along the way.<br />It's the stories that make the book easy to  read.  It's those same stories that illustrate that doing the extra, the  unexpected, the gracious is what will set your business apart from the  rest.<br />If I learned nothing from this book, it's the importance of names.   Knowing them, spelling them correctly, and using them often.  Terrie is  especially adamant about it since her name is misspelled often.  She also  emphasizes that you can't know a person's sex by their name, so make sure  you find out.<br />She practices what she preaches because she must name every  person she knows AND every person who's ever helped her somewhere in this  book.<br />Interspersed in the stories are the suggestions, tips, tricks, and  hints that make the book valuable.  Things like: returning phone calls  within 24 hours; sending thank-you notes; making gifts personal to the  person you're buying for; introducing those who are unknown to the known  (especially when dealing with celebrities); helping without expecting  something in return; the value of your reputation; and much more.<br />This  book would make a good companion to Harvey Mackay's book &quot;Dig Your  Well Before You're Thirsty&quot;. Harvey has even more suggestions than  Terrie and he goes into specifics (such as how he's set up multiple  Rolodexes to keep track of people).  Harvey's of the same school about the  importance of getting to know people, staying in touch with them, and doing  things for them without being asked.<br />Since networking is a fact of life  today, whether online or in person, if you've never read a networking  how-to book, consider this one.<br />If you can only buy one, buy Harvey and  borrow Terrie from the library.  But, you should read both.<br />Note: Terrie  used selected (mild) curse words throughout the text.  Though it seems to  be her style and her way of speaking to her reading audience, I found them  distasteful.  We all let lose with choice words at times, but I find it  extremely unprofessional to use them in a business situation.  This book is  a reflection of her business and it's not flattering.	1999-12-16

Let me tell you the box story: I received a strangely-shaped box from RPS. It was tall and looked like 3 or 4 posters could fit inside, rolled-up & standing upright.    I opened it to find something wrapped in plain, brown Kraft paper. (NO -- I didn't order any porno or sleazy  stuff! )    Inside were 2 books I had requested from Actium Publishing to  review.    The box thing was a suggested promotional idea straight from this  book. Right on page 27, Gielgun, suggests that a package in an unusual  shape will catch the eye of a customer and make them focus on what it is  you're sending them.    He suggests using an ice cream box & enclosing  sales materials that might begin, \\"We just wanted to sweeten your  day.\\" You can get white cake & cookie boxes from bakery supply  houses. Or gold boxes; that would be attention getting!    How about those  Chinese food take-out boxes? They're not expensive.    \\"A New York  based entrepreneur has sent half-envelopes to his potential customers. He  cut regular # 10 envelopes in half and sent only one side (glue-sealed at  the \\"open\\" end) to prospects. The reply rate to these bisected  envelopes was 20% to 30% higher as compared with the whole ones.\\" (p.  27)    The box is the reason this book is being reviewed so soon. Once I got  it open I just had to start thumbing through the book -- the bright red  cover helps, too -- and ideas kept catching my eye.    Next thing I knew,  I'd gone though almost 2/3 of the book! From there, writing this review was  easy.    I'll never underestimate the power of provocative packaging  again.    Broken into 11 chapters, the tips are organized in areas such  as:    => mail order => trade shows & fairs => overseas =>  wholesale => cold calling => online => & more    When I say  tips, don't think I mean 1 or 2 line descriptions. Each idea takes an  entire page & many augment the main idea by providing multiple related  suggestions.    The best way to show how the book works is to give some  abridged examples.    IDEA --New Broom Sweeps Clean (p. 15)    \\"If your  prospects are corporations, and if you want to get on their receptive side,  contact the new, rather than long-time employees. Employees who have been  with a company for many years tend to stick to work routines and practices  which have proven to work for them, and are not very receptive to new  ideas.\\"    IDEA -- Find Yourself a Moniker (p. 28)    \\"For  prospects & customers to remember you, the name of your business may  not be enough. Develop a professional handle that would convey in a  catchphrase the essence of your business. \\" Example: 'The Tune-Up  Maestro' for a car repair shop.    This works because I can't forget a  course (the Clinical Action Guide) I bought from Drew Eric Whitman, DRS --  'Direct Response Surgeon'. He even went so far as to have his sales  materials carry a picture of him in surgical scrubs, masked, & holding  a scalpel.    IDEA -- Make Your Competitors' Advertising Budget Work for You  (p. 94)    Here's a simple way to take customers away from your competitors:  accept their coupons, and make it known that consumers will get from you  the same discounts or incentives your competitors offer in their  ads.\\"    IDEA -- First Year Club (p. 102)    As the owner of a business  start-up, your first, most pressing goal is the creation of a solid  customer base. One way to create repeat customers from the very start is by  offering new customers a 5% discount for life on all your products and  services.\\"    IDEA -- Business That Close Down No Longer Need Their  Telephone Numbers (p. 114)    This is a little know fact, it seems, or how  else can we explain the millions of good phone numbers that go to an early  grave together with their owners every year? A business telephone number  almost always has some life left in it.\\" If a rival business goes down  the tubes, get that number as your own.    I don't want to give away too  much here because Gielgun deserves that his book bepurchased. Just let it  be clear, these ideas & all the others are more detailed than I've  written here.    The reason I say this book's level is beginner/intermediate  is it's almost 50-50, for me at least, between ideas I've come across  before & those totally new to me. The low price makes it affordable to the more experienced  marketer.    But, if you're a very savvy marketing maven, this book is  probably too elementary for you.    As with all things Internet related,  there's nothing new in the 'Online' chapter of the book. It's useful only  for the newbie.	1999-12-16

What may sound like a hippie-dippy, touchy-feely, new age book for the Birkenstock crowd is actually a serious, fact-filled planning tool.    If you believe that your business can be  successful and still be built on principles then this book will not only  reinforce that belief, but walk you through how to go about setting it up  that way from the beginning.  If you're already in business, you can still  use this information to change your direction and refocus your  goals.    Geri Larkin's book grew from her own business career, her  experiences as a Buddhist seminarian, and as a trainer.    Basically, the  idea here is that your values merge with your work.  That you strike a  balance between having a business and having a life.  The steps are easy:  1) simplify your life; 2) make money honestly; and 3) work is one of the  most powerful spiritual practices.  If you run your business by your own  principles, success will naturally follow.    Even if you are not a  Buddhist, the planning tools alone are extremely useful.  Yes, there are  sections about setting your goals and discovering what you want out of your  life and business.  But it's much more.  This is essentially a workbook.   It's full of checklists, worksheets, charts, and formulas.    Beginners will  find this book most useful, but don't dismiss it if you're already in  business.  There are entire chapters devoted to cash flow calculations,  setting up a marketing plan, and writing a business plan.  You know.  A  business plan.  We ALL have one, don't we?    I did remember balance sheets  and income statements, but I sure had forgotten how to do a cash flow  analysis, how to figure mark-ups, and how useful a budget can be.    This is  a book best read with a pencil in hand and a calculator close by.	1999-12-16

This is not an etiquette  book, though the topic is discussed.  It's not a how-to-look-good book, but  that's included, too.  It's not merely an effective communication book,  either.<br />The book chapters cover topics such as:<br />=&gt; first impressions  =&gt; the handshake =&gt; gesturing for impact =&gt; eye contact =&gt; body  language signals =&gt; the power of your voice =&gt; self-promotion =&gt;  making great presentations<br />DOES CASUAL DRESS DAY MAKE YOU WANT TO CALL IN  SICK?<br />Volin's section on 'casual dress' is the best I've ever come  across.  For those who hold outside jobs, casual dress days must be a most  confusing situation.<br />I was never quite sure exactly what 'casual'  actually was and ended up wearing clothes that were more formal than they  needed to be.  I figured it would be better to err on the side of  stuffiness.<br />That was OK around clients, but it made my colleagues  uncomfortable.  I think they felt I was either showing off to the boss or  just standoffish.<br />Buff &amp; Polish explains many different levels of  casual dress based on kind of workplace.  It ranges from well-pressed blue  jeans all the way up what Volin calls 'executive casual'.<br />ACCESSORIES --  ARE YOU A WINNER OR LOSER?<br />Do you ever think about the accessories you  wear, own, &amp; carry?  In 7 packed pages devoted to the subject, here's  what's covered:<br />=&gt; belts &amp; suspenders =&gt; cuff links &amp; shirt  sleeve length =&gt; wrist watches =&gt; jewelry =&gt; socks &amp; stockings  =&gt; shoes =&gt; fabrics =&gt; eyeglasses =&gt; pens &amp; pencils =&gt;  briefcases<br />IMAGE IS MORE THAN CLOTHING<br />Some books I've read talk about  'image' as it pertains to yourbusiness card, brochure, stationery, and  such.  And I've read books that cover how to 'dress for success'.  But,  image takes in so much more.<br />In the chapter &quot;The Power of  Professional Presence&quot; topics include posture, balance, stance, voice  inflection, what to do with your hands, &amp; how to sit.<br />For example, I  asked Volin, &quot;On page 38 of the book, you say not to sit with hands  resting quietly in the lap?  This has always been a favorite position of  mine during interviews.  In fact, I was told to sit like that.  Why do you  not like that position?&quot;<br />Her answer:  &quot;Females have been taught  to take up less space than males.  When sitting in a chair, I recommend  resting your arms on the arms of the chair or at least be more expansive  with your use of space so you appear more confident &amp; less  demure.&quot;<br />Good answer, isn't it?  And one I'd never thought about  before.  It's true that most men take up a larger physical space, and have  deeper, louder voices.  So they automatically come across as more forceful  &amp; self-assured, even if they aren't.<br />USE COLOR TO MAKE A  STATEMENT<br />This is the only business book I know about that considers  color -- it's effect, the proper use of it in clothing &amp; when putting  together a presentation, what it says about your personality, &amp; how it  influences our emotions.<br />Buff and Polish suggests you have a 'color  analysis' done so you can find the colors that will make you look your  best. <br />There are many great benefits to having your colors analyzed.   Wearing the right colors allows natural beauty to shine through while  creating a healthier and younger appearance.  Knowing what colors look best  on you will virtually eliminate costly color mistakes when shopping for  clothing and cosmetics.  Finally, knowing that you look good will help you  feel better about yourself and help you project a more positive image.  <br />Volin takes the discussionof color further.  She also discusses the  psychology of color and the best way to use color in a presentation.<br />A  book bursting with useful information.	1999-12-16

For  everyone else in the world, BUY THIS BOOK!<br />I've never come right out and  blatantly said this before, but the amount of absolutely excellent  information in this book coupled with the low price forces me to.  Oh,  let's not forget the money it will save you, either.<br />I've had this book  on the 'to be read' shelf since August.  I should have read it before I  decided to close all our credit card accounts except one.  I didn't know  the leverage I was losing.  I do now.<br />All the conventional teaching tells  you to close accounts, pay off the card with the lowest outstanding balance  (something psychological about clearing one thing), and then paying all the  rest off.  Daskaloff suggests paying off the card with the highest interest  rate first &amp; NOT close any accounts.  Wait until you read why!  You'll  be completely surprised --well, I was.<br />Parts of this book will make you  do some work.  You'll need:<br />   *  enlarged copies of all the charts<br />    *  a few pencils with erasers<br />   *  a calculator or adding machine<br />   *   file folders or an expanding file<br />   *  all your credit card statements  for the last year<br />Daskaloff walks you step-by-step through the process of  seeing exactly what you owe, what your interest rates are, what your  flexibility rating is (total credit limit/total balance due = flexibility  rating -- anything above 2 is good), how to figure rates for purchases vs.  cash advances, and so much more.<br />He tells you all the bad news about  making minimum payments.  I didn't know (or never paid attention) that when  you make minimum payments the minimum goes DOWN each month, so your  payments are less.  But, what's happening is that you're actually putting  less money on the principal.  In some cases, you're not even covering the  interest from the previous month.  And you're paying forever.<br />Have you  ever received a letter telling you that since you're such a good customer  you can 'skip a payment'?  That's another no-no.  Interest is still  accumulating and you're not really saving.<br />Daskaloff says you should  never pay less than the previous months' interest charge.  Pay much more if  you can.  It's the only way to eliminate the debt.<br />There's a really nifty  section explaining how the same interest rate offered on a variety of  credit cards can differ.  Depending on the terms and how the finance  charges are calculated what you pay might astonish you.<br />One example  follows: you have a card with an APR of 19.2%, a balance of $1000.  You pay  $300 per month on it.  Here are the calculations based on how the finance  charges are figured:<br />1. Adjusted Balance --finance charge = $11.20<br />2.  Average Daily Balance -- finance charge = $13.60<br />3. Previous Balance --  finance charge = $16  (p.103)<br />This book really will help you get back  control of your credit card debt.  There are URL's for all three credit  bureaus, information about transferring balances, using cash advances, and  when to use those checks you get to pay off other cards or buy things.<br />He  also tells you about the various places to get help with your debt, such as  credit counseling &amp; working with each company to set up payments you  can meet.<br />Because I used one of Daskaloff's suggestions I was able to  have my credit card interest rate not only lowered, but a guarantee for it  to stay that way for the next year.<br />I'm still in awe of all the  information packed into 200 pages.<br />If you'd rather keep your head in  the ground, not know how bad off you are, and hope it'll all just go away,  then don't buy this book.  It'll give you power over your credit, obviously  something you don't want!	1999-12-16

We've got Machievelli, Attila the Hun, and, just a few weeks ago, Goldilocks, to name a few.<br />I'm not sure  why this has come about; perhaps it's only a gimmick to grab our attention  and set a particular book apart from the crowd.<br />Gimmicks are OK, I  suppose, but, after you get past that, content &amp; usefulness reign.   Unfortunately, that's not the case in this book.<br />This is probably the  most pretentious book I've come across.  It would be fabulous if you were  teaching a &quot;Business as Literature&quot; course.  It'd be the perfect  book.<br />It's not perfect for the general reader.  If you hated or didn't  understand Shakespeare in school, you're not going to feel any differently  now.<br />It's not Shakespeare's fault this book fails.  Here are some of the  problems I found:<br />=&gt; even though the authors give plot summaries,  unless you are very, VERY familiar with the play in question, you will find  the business stratagems difficult to deduce from the context<br />=&gt; it is  abysmally difficult to read because quotes from the plays are strewn in  between the business parallels the authors are trying to get across<br />=&gt;  though it's sprinkled with examples from modern day businesses (Virgin  Atlantic; Amazon.com; Pak Mail Centers; Dell; &amp; more), they get lost in  a sea of Elizabethan English<br />=&gt; in many places I thought the authors  were working overtime trying to make plots fit the business lessons they  were touting<br />Did I say it was pretentious?  Oh, boy, is it!  Here's why.   The book's overall format is set up like a play: Prologue, Act I, Act II,  and so on, right up to the Epilogue.<br />Then, at the beginning of each  chapter, ah-hem, excuse me!, each act, you get a quote (from the Bard, of  course).<br />And then, get this -- Dramatis Executivus Summarius -- which I  take to mean dramatic executive summary.This is nothing more than an  overall introduction to the theme for the chapter.  It's enough to make you  scream.<br />What follows is the business information broken down into Scene  I, Scene II, etc. until you're just about gagging over the entire concept.   It goes too far.<br />Mixing a business example with a quote slows down the  reading.  Try this one.<br />&quot;When (Richard) Branson phoned People's  Express and kept getting busy signals, he concluded that &quot;they must be  doing really well or they're really inefficient.  If either was true, I  figured there was room for competition.&quot;  He promptly bought a single  747 and began flying customers.  He felt akin to Mercutio in Romeo &amp;  Juliet: &quot;In delay, we waste our lights in vain, like lamps by  day.&quot;&quot; (pp.18-19)<br />Yeah.  Sure.  Akin to Mercutio.  Do you see  what I mean?<br />I recommend this book to anyone who's a fan of Shakespeare,  who loves business books built on gimmicks, or who teaches  Literature.<br />For everyone else --pass.	1999-12-16

All the praise sounds like paid endorsements from friends of the authors.<br />Getting the idea that I didn't like this book?  Not at all.  Actually I loved it.  It was fun to read  &amp; quick.<br />But, that's all it was -- animated &amp; entertaining.<br />Goldilocks is purely ephemeral with management insights added in  order to convince you that what you're reading has substance.  The  so-called 'business principles' are nothing more than short, shallow  blurbs.<br />Here's how the book is arranged.  There are 27 different fairy  tales.  There are two I'm not familiar with.  Ever hear of the &quot;Bremen  Town Musicians?&quot;  Or &quot;The Old Woman &amp; Her Pig?&quot; <br />Each  tales is modernized and reflects a business theme.  For example, The Three  Bears operate a budget motel deep in the forest and Chicken Little reads  the Wall Street Journal because she follows the prices on corn  commodities.<br />The story follows with details concerning a business issue  such as:<br />=&gt; marketing =&gt; team building =&gt; sales =&gt; cash flow  =&gt; hiring employees =&gt; customer service<br />A shaded box follows called  * Basic Lesson *.  Sometimes there's more:<br />=&gt; how the tale applies to  serious managers =&gt; a real-life story =&gt; a conclusion, called the  'bottom line'<br />What I found is that most of the time the 'lesson' wasn't  what I thought it was.  It might be me, but I think the tale's outcomes  aren't clear.<br />Let's talk 'Sleeping Beauty'.  You all know the basic  story.  In the Mayer's version Beauty's parents are wealthy beyond  imagination.  Think Bill Gates.  She has everything she could want --  wealth, beauty, intelligence.<br />The curse put on her by the uninvited guest  is:  &quot;Nothing worldly will ever satisfy you.  All this wealth is going  to bore you, enervate you, exhaust you.  It will all seem so tawdry and  meaningless that you won't be able to stay awake.&quot; (p.67)<br />The  Mayer's lesson is that you shouldn't leave people out of your planning  process because it results in poor outcomes.(read Wicked Witch)<br />My take,  from the way the tale is written, is this: when you give someone all they  need in worldly goods, when they have everything, then you remove all  motivation to excel at anything.  They have nothing to strive for.<br />Or how  about the 'Ugly Duckling'?  In this version the lesson is to nurture and  tolerate your staff's innate skills &amp; differences.<br />Yet the story  makes it clear that the swan (ugly duckling) was forced to leave the ducks  because he didn't fit in with the corporate culture.  The way he looks  doesn't adhere to the duck dress code &amp; he trumpets when he should  quack.<br />In most of these tales the conclusions don't support the story  examples.<br />Who's right?  I don't know.  Maybe it doesn't matter.<br />What  does matter is the authors came up with a neat gimmick then made the tales  fit their pre-conceived business lesson.  At least that's my  conclusion.<br />If you come across this book when you're browsing the  bookstore &amp; you have time, read some of it.  If you see it at the  library, check it out.  Buy it only if you have extra money around &amp;  are looking for some business fluff to break up the day's work.	1999-12-16

Most business people who deal with foreigners speak English, French, or  both<br />The appendix contains interesting &amp; valuable information, too.   I especially liked the pictures of phone, electrical, &amp; ground  adaptors.  There's an entire page of metric equivalents for those who don't  use them daily.  Morrison includes a page about travel medical insurance,  too.<br />What's missing?  Information about African countries is nearly  non-existent.  Other than Egypt, no other country is covered, not even  South Africa.<br />And, if you're looking for in-depth information about  online courtesies, you'll have to dig deep to find them. There are few.	1999-12-16

You will if you read Dana May Casperson's book.    While including many of the basics you'd expect in an etiquette book, she also covers subjects such as:      *  tea meetings  *  video conferencing  *  teleconferencing  *   chairing meetings  *  cultural courtesies  *  travel safety  *   physical disabilities  *  using a concierge    Interspersed throughout  the text are Q & A's specific to the topic under discussion.  One of  the questions she deals with, often missing from books on manners, is  tipping maids in hotels.    I have a special interest in this because I  spent a year working as a hotel maid when I was in college.  Sad to say  that the majority of hotel guests do NOT leave tips.  Casperson suggests $1  to $1.50 per person/day.    She also addresses those of us who work at home  by suggesting we have a least 2 'knock 'em dead' outfits available at all  times.  Everyone will need to meet with a client or attend a lunch at some  point, so this makes sense.    This suggestion is also good for anyone who  has to travel for business.  Having a few outfits you can pull together at  a moment's notice and knowing that they fit properly and look good will  make anything unexpected seem a breeze.  This goes for men, too!    Another  suggestion is to have an 'emergency kit' in your desk, briefcase, and/or  car.  This would consist of:     *  extra socks or pantyhose  *   deodorant  *  toothbrush, toothpaste, & breath mints  *  a  sewing kit/safety pins  *  makeup/shaving supplies/facial tissue  *   nail file/nail clippers/hand cream  *  hairbrush/comb         *  a  small address book with phone numbers, email, etc. of clients, doctor &  family member for emergencies    There's also an entire section about  corporate gifting.  Many companies do not allow employees to accept gifts  or only allow gifts under a certain dollar amount.    This part of the book  includes many suggestions for gifts as well as theproper use of your  business name/logo on gifts.    There are a few places where I think she  dropped the ball.  I don't think it's a good idea to include your home  address, phone and fax number in your email signature file.  For those  working at home, especially women, it could be dangerous.    I also disagree  with her suggestion to take a hostess gift when you're staying at someone's  home for a weekend.  I think it's OK to bring something small like  chocolates or a bottle of wine, just as you would when invited to dinner.   But, it's always better to send a 'thank you' gift after you return home so  you are able to select something appropriate to your host's home,  interests, and tastes.    Is this the best book of business etiquette?  Not  in my opinion.  But, I read & collect etiquette books so I'm  biased.    Letitia Baldrige's New Complete Guide to Executive Manners is  longer and more in-depth. As the social secretary for First Lady Jacqueline  Kennedy, she's also an in-demand speaker on subjects such as \\"Business  Protocol\\" and \\"Executive Presence.\\"  Some find her  old-fashioned, but she's my personal favorite.    If you want a good, quick,  basic overview of what's-what for proper business manners, then Power  Etiquette is a worthwhile book with over 180 pages of information.     A  note: Casperson has absolutely no sense of humor.  Both Letitia Baldrige  and Miss Manner's have a breezy way of writing about etiquette that removes  the stuffiness.  Unfortunately, you couldn't find a spark of wit here if you had a map.	1999-12-16

Janet Attard is a familiar name to most people doing business on the Internet, especially on AOL.<br />She has been the force behind the growth of the Business Know-How discussion boards &amp; newsletter. She plans over 70 weekly live chats, as well as compiling thousands of articles, tips, &amp;  hints on every aspect of small business you can name.<br />This book begins after you've done  all the basic start-up work for your business. There is no discussion of  the best legal form for your business to take &amp; you won't find  questionnaires to test your entrepreneurial skills. Attard assumes you've  passed that point &amp; are ready to go to work.<br />What you will get is  insight on topics such as:<br />=&gt; finding suppliers =&gt; mailing &amp;  shipping strategies =&gt; trade show savvy =&gt; selling to the government  =&gt; building a web site without going broke =&gt; making cash flow =&gt;  how to make a big impression on a small budget =&gt; using the mail to  build business =&gt; choosing &amp; using office equipment<br />I must admit  that I thought Attard would have nothing new or of interest to me.  After  all, I've been in business for some time. (egotistical, isn't it?)<br />But,  she surprised me with a number of interesting &amp; useful ideas. Briefly,  here are a few:<br />=&gt; make use of a CD-ROM phone directory. Attard  suggests one called SelectPhone costing about $150. It will allow you to  find customers &amp; suppliers. (p. 84)<br />=&gt; ask for an editorial  calendar. The editorial calendar briefly lists the types of stories that  will be covered each month for the calendar year. Newspapers &amp;  magazines plan far ahead for special topic issues. (p 91)<br />=&gt; advertise  where your competitors advertise. If your competitors have been advertising  for many months in a specific media, their ads are probably working.(p.  104)<br />=&gt; familiarize yourself with advertising laws. Just because  you're small doesn't mean you can ignore or avoid complying with laws  regulating advertising.(p 120) There follows a page and a half of laws that  might trip up a small business owner.<br />=&gt; buy US postage stamps at less  than their face value. Buy your stamps from a stamp dealer rather than the  post office.  Stamp dealers often buy stamps in quantity hoping they will  go up in value.(p. 149) I really liked this one and  * never * would have  thought of it.<br />I could give many more examples, but that wouldn't be fair  to Attard, who's obviously put blood &amp; sweat into this book<br />Let me  leave you with some more topics of interest:<br />=&gt; using the web ferret  for quick web searching =&gt; the when &amp; how of yellow page ads =&gt;  what's a press room &amp; why you want to use it =&gt; your trade show  toolbox -- what's in it &amp; why =&gt; what you should know about credit  card fraud<br />You're all getting used to the fact that I'm as much a  stickler about the design of a book as I am about content.<br />This book is  well laid out, the type is large enough to read easily, &amp; typefaces are  consistent through out the book.<br />The few gray boxes used are well placed  &amp; don't interrupt the flow of the text.  My only dislike is this: to  make the * tips * boxes stand out from the other gray boxes, all the text  contained within them is underlined.  They are the only part of the book I  found difficult to read &amp; found myself skipping over them most of the  time.  I know I missed valuable information because of it.	1999-12-16

A good, all-round variety of tasty  dishes using ingredients easily found.  You won't have to stock up on  esoteric spices and vegetables. The preparation instructions are clear and  easy to understand.  There are even side bars on the pages with hints,  substitutions, and sample menus. The &quot;Before You Begin&quot; section  tells you how to stock your pantry...what to have on hand in the way of  equipment, condiments, spices, etc.. The book is not overly heavy on  desserts. One of my pet peeves with most cookbooks is too many desserts not  enough &quot;real food.&quot;  What I would have liked is a better index.  For example, look up pasta and you get a list of four dishes and then the  phrase &quot;see also specific types.&quot;  If you don't know the name of  the specific pasta recipe you're looking for, you'd miss it.  It forces you  to really look through the book.  Also, I'm not sure why all cookbooks  these days DON'T include nutritional information for all the recipes.   Calories per serving, carbohydrates, protein, chloresterol, salt, etc.  should be included.	1998-10-24

An introductory section gives suggestions for stocking a vegetarian pantry. There's also a brief overview of nutritional needs. Since these recipes are from around the world, the variety is refreshing and different. My only caveat is that I expected more recipes for the price. The books has about 200 for the price of [$]. I don't know if we're paying for the glossy paper, the beautiful colored pictures, or Linda's name.	1998-10-24
