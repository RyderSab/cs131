The Last Vampire was published by Archway Paperbacks (Pocket Books) as a book for &quot;young adults&quot; but it is can be enjoyed by all fans of the vampire genre.  It is concise and fast-paced and totally unlike the slow moving and sometimes wordy Anne Rice books.  The book introduces us to a 5,000 year old vampire who looks like a beautiful 18 year old girl.  She is intelligent, powerful and deadly.  If you like vampires, you will like The Last Vampire.	2001-12-24

The romance in these books reminds me somewhat of the delightful Harriet Vane/Lord Peter mysteries by Dorothy Sayers.  The historical research is impressive and the writing is great.  In Death at Daisy's Folly the authors describe life the highest ranks of society in Victorian England.  The Prince of Wales and his mistress, Daisy, are spending a weekend at Daisy's estate.  Sir Charles Sheridan is asked by the Prince to investigate a suspicious death, and Sir Charles and the lovely Kate are thrown together again during the investigation.  If you enjoy romance, history and mystery, you will enjoy this book.	2001-09-21

Mr. Sandford's stories contain gore, violence, humor and sex.  He tells his stories well, but don't buy a Sandford novel expecting to find a &quot;fair&quot; mystery with all of the clues set out in a way that the reader can unscramble.  In Easy Prey, the 11th book in the Prey series, Minneapolis Deputy Police Chief Lucas Davenport goes after the murderer of a beautiful fashion model.  Suspicion falls on lovers, drug dealers and others.  The deaths mount as the hunt continues.	2001-09-19

He has written some excellent supernatural horror novels.  This book is classified as a horror novel because that is what Richard Laymon normally writes, but it reads more like a mystery than a horror novel.  I enjoy mysteries, so I enjoyed this book.  It contains more gore than most books in the mystery genre, but less horror than most books in the horror genre.  This is not Richard Laymon's best book, but a good storyteller is always fun to read.	2001-09-16

The book provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses, the good points and bad points of the men we call Cowboys.

That means there is graphic sex; and some of the graphic sex in this Buckskin novel involves rape.  With that warning out of the way, I tell you that the Roy Lebeau Buckskin series is by far the best of the genre.  (Avoid the Kit Dalton Buckskin books; they are among the worst of the genre.)  In Colt Creek, Buckskin Frank Leslie rides into town broke and hungry.  He becomes a full-time bartender and a part-time lawman.  The powerful Coe family is trying to stamp out any possible opposition to Coe control of Colt Creek.  Buckskin Frank Leslie stands in their way.  If you enjoy adult westerns, you will love this book.  Note 1:  There really was a gunfighter named Buckskin Frank Leslie.  He rode with Wyatt Earp and he may well have been the man who killed Johnny Ringo.  Note 2:  &quot;Roy Lebeau&quot;  writes excellent adventure novels under another name.	2001-09-06

The previous Arly-Hanks-in-Maggody mysteries have all rated four or five stars in my opinion.  I have read most of them two or three times.  Unfortunately, the 12th book in the series does not compare favorably with the earlier books.  Arly is still chief of police in Maggody.  Ruby Bee and Estelle are still doing their best to be helpful.  Raz is still in love with his pig.  The regular Maggody cast of characters is in the book, but Joan Hess' magical spark seems to be missing.  (Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers had some efforts that don't rate four stars, so it can happen to anyone.)  Read this one if you want to keep up with developments in Maggody, but if you have not read any of the Maggody mysteries, don't start with this one;  it is not representative of the author's great talent.	2001-09-05

(Don't you hate it when authors have allegedly intelligent characters do incredibly stupid things?) There is a little of the amateur-detective-does-something-stupid at the climax, but not enough to prevent me from looking forward to the next book in what I hope will be a long and successful series. The book is set in Victorian England. The amateur detectives are a wealthy Englishman, Sir Charles, and an independent-minded American woman who goes to England to take a job as secretary to her wealthy aunt. The characters are enjoyable, the setting is enjoyable, the writing is superb.	2001-09-05

Her talent as an author shines out of every page of this wonderful book. The book is set in the vicinity of Milan, Italy, in 1825 with flashbacks to 1821. The rich and powerful members of high society in Milan spend their evenings at the opera house unless they are relaxing at villas on Lake Como. Amateur detective, English dandy Julian Kestrel arrives in Milan in 1825 to solve the four year old murder of a powerful nobleman. The amount of &quot;action&quot; at the climax as well as the length of some of the explanations of relationships at the conclusion of the book may irritate a few mystery purists, but that is a small price to pay for the beautiful tapestry of words woven by Ms. Ross throughout this novel.<BR>The death of Ms. Ross was a great loss to American liturature. The author's biographical note on the hardcover edition indicates that she was a trial attorney. If she was as good in court as she was as an author, I am glad that I never had to face her.	2001-08-30

Ms. Ross wrote four Julian Kestrel books before her death. This is the third book in the series.

The novel focuses on a pshychiatrist who seems to have as many mental problems as the people she is supposedly treating.  In fact, every character in the book seems to have serious mental problems.  There is some sex in the book, but most of it isn't likely to excite the reader.  There is a lot of gore if you like gore.  There is a vampire who rarely appears as a vampire.

There are seldom any car chases, shootouts, fist fights or explosions.  There is no bad language or graphic sex.  Christie's great talent was in putting together word puzzles.  She puts all the clues in front of us and then devotes her considerable talent to confusing and misleading us as to the identity of the murderer.  And she does it so wonderfully and so completely that we love her.  Go figure.  If you are new to the mystery genre, start with another book.  This one was written for experienced mystery readers.  If you are an avid reader of cozy mysteries, you will love The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.	2001-08-03

Her style was to create the atmosphere of an English village before 1935 and to create a puzzle involving the death of someone in the village.  Her detectives don't beat anyone up or make love to the suspects.  Her detective is given the same clues that the reader sees, and in the last chapter, the detective weaves the relevant clues into the solution.  In The Body in the Library, the detective is Jane Marple, an elderly spinster who uses a sharp mind so solve the puzzle.  I like the early Jane Marple mysteries; The Body in the Library is fairly typical.  You might find this book more enjoyable if you first read The Murder at the Vicarage.	2001-08-03

If you prefer action filled American mysteries or fast moving Sherlock Holmes tales, Agatha Christie is probably not for you.  She creates mind puzzles in which you are given all the clues while the author tries to confuse and mislead you into suspecting the wrong person.  No one has ever been better at red herrings and misdirection than Agatha Christie.  If you enjoy glimpses into British life in the 1920's  combined with enjoyable characterizations and creative plotting, settle down to enjoy an excellent example of the cozy mystery genre.  The Murder at the Vicarage combines all of the best characteristics of vintage Agatha Christie without the sometimes annoying presence of Agatha Christie's more famous detective, Hercule Poirot.	2001-08-03

Slocum rides in to rescue the maiden in distress.  Because this is an adult series Western, we have a few graphic sex scenes and a few gunfights.  Because there is apparently very little editing done in adult series Westerns and dozens of different writers submit material to the series publisher, the quality within the series varies greatly from book to book.  Strangely, the quality of Slocum and the Lone Star Feud varies widely WITHIN the book.  The first few chapters are excellent.  Somewhere around page 40, the book goes from five star to one star.  Apparently the author and the editor were not aware of Gray's Rules for Westerns.  There is a gross violation of rule number five which says that the hero should never be captured by the bad guys or knocked unconscious more than once in a book (and not at all is preferable).	2001-07-28

In this mystery, a science fiction author is murdered at a small meet-some-authors gathering at a bookstore.   The premise is good, but the characters are either boring or irritating.  I kept hoping that one of the men in the book would eat a steak, say &quot;shut up&quot; to one of the women, and find a backbone.  I also hoped the parrot would fly away, that the female characters would exhibit some common sense, and that the book would end.

During the trial Lord Peter becomes infatuated with Harriet, not because of her appearance but because of her intelligence, poise and personality.  A hung jury gives Lord Peter time to search for the real killer.<br />  Agatha Christie may have a slight edge over Dorothy Sayers in the creation of plots and puzzles, but Ms. Sayers has the edge in the use of language and in the creation of vivid characters.  Lord Peter is a delightful detective.  His romance with Harriet Vane continues through four wonderful books which should be read in sequence.

The crime solver in the Evanovich novels is Stephanie Plum, bounty hunter from hell.  Her job is to recover criminals who have been released on bond but who have failed to show up for court appearances.  Stephanie is assisted in her efforts to become a successful bond enforcement agent by two men who make women drool and by Grandma Mazur who strikes terror in the hearts of funeral directors.  Stephanie's adventures with men, cars and funeral homes make this series incomparably funny.  <br />As is the case with most well-written series, relationships change and characters develop as new books come out, so I advise reading the Evanovich books in sequence starting with One for the Money.  If you don't have a sense of humor, stay away from Evanovich.	2001-07-28

She has a command of English and a story-telling ability that makes her, in my opinion, one of the two greatest mystery writers of the twentieth century.  Most of Ms. Sayers' mysteries feature Lord Peter, second son of the Duke of Denver.  He is one of the most delightful characters in English literature and well worth meeting in any of Ms. Sayers books.   Most of the Lord Peter mysteries stand alone and can be read without worrying about sequence.  However four of the mysteries involve Harriet Vane, and for maximum enjoyment, those four mysteries should be read in order.  Strong Poison describes the first meeting between Harriet and Lord Peter.  Have His Carcase explores the relationship between the two of them as they investigate the death of a man whose body Harriet discovers while hiking along a deserted beach.  The interaction between the two of them can best be understood and appreciated if Strong Poison is read first.  Have His Carcase may be the least enjoyable of the four  romance-mysteries involving Harriet, but this book leads to the final two books in the series, and those two books are the finest romance-mysteries ever written.	2001-07-28

Occasionally I come across one in the middle.  Longarm books are written by many different people and all of the books are attributed to a presumably non-existent person named Tabor Evans.  Because some of the Longarm authors write like eighth graders, its dangerous to buy a Longarm without first reading a review by a trustworthy reviewer.  The author of Mountain Bandit is a good author. If he or she had been allowed to create a new hero, I believe the book would have been very enjoyable.  Unfortunately, to those few of us who read all of the good Longarm books, the Longarm of Mountain Bandit does not quite match our image of the &quot;real&quot; Longarm.

The books in this series are worth reading as an introductory course in antiques.  In the later books in the series, Lovejoy's irrational and self-destructive behavior may bother some readers.  Lovejoy's treatment of women is likely to bother feminists.<br />The Judas Pair is an early Lovejoy mystery.  A man who claims to own a legendary set of matching dueling weapons is murdered, and the weapons are not found in his collection.

Before her death at the age of 82 in 1995, she wrote a series of 20 mysteries set in England and Wales during the 12th Century.  (She also wrote many other books under her real name, Edith Pargeter.)  In the Cadfael mysteries, her &quot;detective&quot; is a former Crusader who has decided to spend his last years as a monk in a monastery in Shrewsbury.  I have found the Brother Cadfael in the books to be far more interesting than the Brother Cadfael of the television series.  Many of the books in the Cadfael series are as much (or more) historical romances as they are mysteries.   Don't start any book in this series unless you enjoy a strong dose of romance and medieval English history mixed with mystery.  The Cadfael series (like most good series) is more enjoyable if the books are read in sequence.  Dead Man's Ransom is the ninth book in the series.<br />In Dead Man's Ransom, Brother Cadfael is called upon to solve the murder of the Sheriff of Shropshire, Gilbert Prescote.  Suspicion falls on a Welsh captive and on others who have a grudge against the stern sheriff.  Cadfael's investigation is hampered by Welsh raids along the border and by continued strife within England.	2001-06-14

Holly's life centers around her two Alaskan malamutes.

Concurrently, Holly is researching an actual historical event in which a woman who had been captured by native Americans managed to escape (killing several of her captors in the process). I enjoyed the combination of colonial history and wry humor aimed at dog fanciers and Harvard professors.  I read Susan Conant because I enjoy the world she creates and the vivid way she brings dogs to life on the printed page.

The book starts somewhat slowly, but when the action begins, it builds quickly.  Joanna is forced to deal with office strife, the normal pressures of a new job, and the murder of a respected acquaintance. This is the second book in a series.  It is usually more rewarding to begin a series with the first book, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book without having read Desert Heat, the first in the series.	2001-05-26
US	48950701	R2PR4HQ8HHL5ST	0671694952	174526762	Baptism for the Dead	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A good mystery in an excellent series	Robert Irvine has created a detective named Moroni Traveler who has a love/hate (perhaps mostly hate) relationship with the Mormon Church in Salt Lake City.  The author, in creating the setting for his novels, takes us into the history of the Mormon Church and its relationship to Utah political power.  The characters are interesting and likable and the background is interesting.  In Baptism for the Dead, the detective is hired to find a missing person and winds up, somewhat unwillingly, assisting the Mormon Church in its battle against a local cult.      Robert Irvine can be counted on to deliver a well-written and enjoyable mystery.  Baptism for the Dead is worth reading.	2001-05-05

If you prefer protagonists who combat evil and overcome hardships, avoid this book.  The book is set in California during the Depression.  The book convincingly portrays the agony of the dust bowl victims who headed for California in the hope of starting a new life.  Among the travelors is a man named Cooper.  Cooper, to avoid a prison term, becomes a paymaster for an orange grower who employs and abuses migrant workers.  A nanny employed by the orange grower believes that she has the power to control dead animals and dead people.  Cooper, seemingly unable to control any circumstances, is driven by circumstances beyond his control into mental and emotional hell.	2000-11-18

She writes with zest.  Her stories hold the interest of her readers.  Her characters have feelings.  Blood Debt is the fifth book in a series featuring a strange love triangle composed of the vampire son of King Henry VIII, a vampire female detective from Toronto and a human Toronto police officer.  In Blood Debt, ghosts seek vengeance, and our three protagonists set out to find the murderer responsible for the ghosts. Ms Huff writes with more than a touch of humor.  The police officer, in the midst of an escape attempt gone awry, asks himself:  What was that plan again?  Let him beat you sensless and then escape in the confusion?....Oh, good plan.  As with most well-written series, its most satisfying if the reader starts with the first book in the series (Blood Price) and continues through the series chronologically.	2000-10-27

Rebels and Readcoats covers every significant military action in the eastern colonies from Lexington to Yorktown.  The book is superbly researched and beautifully written.  I first read this book as a teenager forty years ago and loved it.  I read it for the fifth time last year, and I still love it.	2000-10-14

The lovers find it difficult to keep the tryst a secret when burglaries, thefts and murders abound.<br />I enjoyed the Sayers-like references to literature and the Jonathan Gash-like discussion of antiques.  However, you should avoid this book if you find it irritating when (1) heroines withhold evidence from the police or (2) heroines, knowing that there is a murderer at large, place themselves in dangerous situations.	2000-10-14

He has written a series of books in which:  1.  The Devil uses sex to take control of a community.  2.  God's warrior (Sam Balon in various incarnations) fights the Devil.  3.  Lots of people get killed, raped, tortured, turned into zombies, turned into vampires.  4.  Big Battle.<br />Johnstone's discriptions of &quot;arguments&quot; between God and the Archangel Michael may irritate thoghtful Christian readers.  If you like lots of violence and some graphic sex, you will give the book a fairly high rating.  If you are a stickler for logic and theological consistency, you will give it one or two stars.	2000-10-14

The hero of a series of books by Fletcher Pratt and L. Sprague DeCamp learns how to travel to the alternate universes.  The Wall of Serpents is set in the world of Irish myth.  The authors are great story-tellers and this series works very well.  The sword fights, battles of magic, and battles of wit are all delightful.  The reader will find this book more enjoyable if it is read after The Compleat Enchanter.	2000-10-10

Agatha Christie comes to the rescue, and the two most famous mystery writers of the mid-Twentieth Century set out to solve a mystery.  If you are already familiar with events in the lives of Agatha and Dorothy, this book will not reveal anything about their lives that you don't already know.  The book is worth reading if you are (as I am) a lover of the works of Agatha and Dorothy.  But don't expect the plot or the writing to equal the efforts of the real Agatha Christy and Dorothy Sayers.	2000-10-10

I love her style, her humor, her ability to entertain and her ability to use the English language.  It is fairly obvious why Ms. Sayers did not finish this book.  The part of the novel written by Ms. Sayers is far below her usual standards.  The part of the novel written by Ms. Walsh is so unlike anything Ms. Sayers would have written that I am amazed that some reviewers talk about the book being &quot;seamless&quot; and well-written.  Dorothy Sayers is a great author, but she knew what she was doing when she stuck this book away in the safe.  I'm sorry that her heirs didn't leave it there.	2000-10-08

In my opinion, it is the most satisfying book in the series.  It contains enough gunfights,  humor, sex and history to make the book a delight for intelligent readers.   The Gents (Riley Stokes and Cas McCasland) decide to make easy money by  becoming bounty hunters.  They set out to collect the bounty on an innocent  man who has fled to Palo Duro.  The change from bounty hunters to rescuers  is facilitated by the beautiful sister of the wanted man.  As in the first  book in this series, Thorstad has created a very interesting set of  characters -- even the guys in black hats are enjoyable.	2000-09-01

The  first twelve books in this series were written by a marvelous author using  the pen name Roy Lebeau.  Any one of the Lebeau books rates among the best  westerns ever written.  I wonder why publishers can't give us more westerns  of this caliber.  In Pistoltown, Buckskin Frank Leslie, one of the premier  shootists of the old west, helps a woman hold on to her ranch against the  bad guys.  Lebeau describes gunfights better than any other author.  (Note:   don't waste money on the Buckskin &quot;novels&quot; written by anyone  except Roy Lebeau.)	2000-08-26

Many of the characters in this book have been introduced to us in  Martin's previous books, and it is probably a good idea to read The  Education of Jennifer Parrish only after reading the earlier books in the  series. If you are turned on by stories of sexual domination, you will  probably like this series.	2000-08-18

First you must read Strong Poison, then  Have His Carcase, then Gaudy Night.  When you have finished the first  three, you are ready for a reading experience that will delight any lover  of good literature.  Dorothy Sayers and Agatha Christie may not have liked  each other very much, but I am in love with both of them.  They knew how to  WRITE!	2000-08-12

Joan Hess has created a town full of  interesting (and very funny) people.  Living in Maggody might be hell;   reading about Maggody is heaven.  If you were turned off by the Claire  Malloy series by Hess (and who isn't irritated by heroines who can only  unmask a killer by doing something incredibly stupid), don't worry.  The  Maggody series is blessed with humor, wit and charm and a likable heroine.   Miracles in Maggody unfairly stereotypes fundamentalist Christians.  But  Hess unfairly stereotypes most other ethnic and religious groups -- and  does it with so much light hearted style -- that even a dyed in the wool  fundamentalist like me enjoyed the book.	2000-08-12

In Martians in  Maggody, an enterprising moonshiner bolsters the local economy by creating  a tourist attraction in a corn field.  This field of dreams (or nightmares,  for the local police chief)becomes a murder scene.   As always, Police  Chief Arly Hanks is bothered more by her meddlesome mother and by the  characters who populate the strange world of Maggody than by the Martians  and the murderer who are only passing through.	2000-08-12

Each of his books is so well written that they are a pleasure to read. Gunstock is the second book in the series. Other books in the series have better gunfights, but this book has a set of very satisfying villains. Its a pleaure to read a work by a writer who knows that horses need food, water and rest, that hard blows to the head can cause brain damage or death, and that Westerns can be a literary art form. Very highly recommended if you are not offended by graphic sex and violence.	2000-08-12

His Horatio Hornblower novels are the best works in their genre.  All of  the Forester novels are easy to read and well crafted.  Unfortunately, the  time Forester spent writing Payment Deferred would have been better spent  on another Hornblower novel.  This is a mediocre work by a great author.   It is only of interest to those of us who want to read everything written  by C. S. Forester.	2000-08-12

If you enjoy novels in  which good people are dragged into depravity but struggle to escape the  sexual bonds imposed on them, Russ Martin is for you.  In this book,  Jennifer Young is becomes the slave of one of the leaders of the forces of  evil.  More erotic than frightening and more wordy than necessary.	2000-08-12

Logic would tell you that the first book in an adult western series would be carefully selected and carefully edited so that readers would come back  for more. Logic would be wrong in the case of Rowan's Raiders, the first  book in the Scout series. Our hero's actions defy logic as completely as  the publisher's.  The Scout sleeps soundly or daydreams while wolves,  bears, Indians and outlaws approach withing striking distance.  (The only  times he is alert to approaching danger are the times when nymphomaniacal  women approach his camp.)  Fortunately, for the Scout, he escapes the  wolves, bears, Indians and outlaws because he is equipped with magic  matches which are able to start improbable fires under any circumstances, a  magic knive which cures bulletholes and arrow wounds, and an immortal  horse.  It also helps that the bad guys keep forgetting to kill the Scout  despite being presented with many opportunities.  The height of absurdity  is reached when the Scout stumbles upon the rough hewn log cabin of the  filthy outlaws and finds it empty, even the bathroom.  Our intrepid author  doesn't explain what a bathroom is doing in an outlaw hideout in the  Dakotas in the 1870's.	2000-08-11
