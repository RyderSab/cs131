US	49102989	R38IS5U9LE86J0	1563890534	664686034	Shazam!, The - Archives, Volume 1 (Archive Editions)	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Curiously Flat, Albeit Entertaining	First, the caveat: vintage comics must be taken for what they are, for good and for ill.  They are plot-heavy and character-light.  The plots are outrageously unbelievable, with a liberal use of deus ex machina.  In many ways, the early Captain Marvel stories found in the \\"Shazam! Archives\\" Vol. 1 are the apotheosis of vintage comics, as Marvel faces unlikely threats in impossible stories.  However, from the beginning, Captain Marvel had one advantage: the art of C.C. Beck, which, although in its infancy in these first issues of \\"Whiz Comics,\\" originally published by Fawcett, was already showing the distinct qualities that have defined the Marvel family to this day.      The frustrating thing about this volume is the formulaic approach writer Bill Everett takes in his scripts.  He gives the reader a very exciting origin for this new super-hero.  Billy Batson, a homeless paperboy follows a mysterious stranger into the subway (pretty irrationally), and is taken to the wizard, Shazam.  Shazam gives Billy the power to transform into the adult Captain Marvel by uttering the wizard's name.  Billy quickly uses his new powers to thwart the evil Dr. Sivana, and gain himself a job as a roving radio reporter (school not being a concern for child super-heroes at this time).      But after that admittedly stirring origin, the series falls into a pattern: Billy is assigned to report on some odd event, finds some sinister agent behind it (frequently Sivana) as part of a bid to conquer or destroy the world, and then thwarts it handily as Captain Marvel.  They stories are not without their charms, of course, with some fun concepts along the way, like Sivana and his daughter Beautia ruling the planet Venus.  There are certain things that were unique to this strip, the big one being the fact that Sivana, Marvel's most persistent enemy, knows the secret of his power.  Another interesting plot point is Beautia's amorous feelings forCaptain Marvel, which is amusing because of course as Marvel is really still at the age where he finds girls \\"icky.\\"  However, most critics admit that Everett's scripts were serviceable at best, especially compared with that came later under the stewardship of Otto Binder.    If you want to read the whole \\"Shazam!\\" Archive series, obviously, you should start here.  But be advised that it's a curiously flat, albeit entertaining, volume, and that its going to be a little while get to the greatest material the Marvel family had to offer.	2005-10-06

Each volume is just a good rousing and satisfying read.  However, with this new volume, \\"Fathers and Sons,\\" Sakai has shown that he is not willing to rest on his laurels, and that he keeps pushing for better things.    Miyamoto Usagi is traveling with Jotaro, the son of the woman Usagi once loved.  However, unknown to young Jotaro, Usagi is not merely a beloved \\"uncle,\\" but his father.  Usagi is conflicted.  He is escorting Jotaro to Katsuichi, Usagi's sensei, to learn the samurai way.  Should Usagi tell Jotaro the truth, or would that cause too much pain for Jotaro?  However, there is another secret that Usagi doesn't know that puts a sad and intriguing spin on events.    As the title suggests, the overall theme of this volume is the father/son relationship.  The titular story has Usagi and Jotaro coming to the aid of Lone Goat and Kid, Sakai's parody of Lone Wolf and Cub.  In \\"The Pride of the Samurai,\\" Usagi and Jotaro encounter a stubbornly proud but completely destitute ronin and his son as they seek to defend their meager squatter's shack from the local government.    However, not all of the stories concern themselves with paternity.   In \\"Kill the Geishu Lord,\\" Usagi once again crosses paths with the young lord Noriyuki and his vassal Tomoe, as a gang seizes a village to set a trap.  It's a straightforward action tale, as is \\"Hokashi,\\" in which our heroes encounter a group of assassins disguised as street performers.  Naturally, this gang has a grudge against Usagi.  These stories reveal that Jotaro is quite the formidable little fighter, a chip off the old block.  The last story, \\"Bells,\\" is a tale of Katsuichi-sensei's youth, a sad tale of his love of the woman of another dojo, and the tragedy that resulted.    These are all good stories, but the real impact of this volume lies in Usagi's final decision about telling Jotaro the truth.  I won't spoil it, but any astute reader will see it coming, as well as that twist Sakai throws in.  Sakai sucessfully writes a very touching moment because it is completely in character for Usagi to make that decision.  This attention to character is why this series transcends its furry animal trappings and achieves something quite sophisticated, almost brilliant.    Anyone who hasn't read Usagi Yojimbo should.  This volume might not be the best place to start, as it is unusually heavy on past continuity.  On the other hand, Sakai makes his work very accessible, even this volume.  On its own merits, this volume stands out as one of the best of a series that is in itself one of the best the medium has to offer.	2005-09-25
US	49102989	RJUQUDRRHC4FP	0345457242	772147660	Drive to the East (Settling Accounts Trilogy, Book 2)	Books	4	5	6	N	N	A Nice Rewarding Romp in an Enjoyable Series	At this point, you are either on board with Harry Turtledove's massive alternate history of a southern Civil War victory or you are not.  You've accepted his ability to tell an entertaining story despite his numerous flaws, or you've just given up on him.  There isn't much in-between.  So this review of \\"Settling Accounts: Drive to the East\\" is probably most useful to people who are still on board.      In 1942, the CS, under fascistic president (and Hitler stand-in) Jake Featherston have driven through the US up to Sandusky, Ohio, splitting the US in half.  Despite the fury of Featherston's blitzkrieg and the death of US president Al Smith during a bombing, Featherston is chagrined to realize that the US is not going to roll over and give him what he wants, and so the CS, despite its more limited resources, must push on to Philadelphia, the US capital.  At the same time, the US begins pushing back, attacking Fredericksburg, VA, while also fighting the Mormons in Utah, Canadian rebels, and the Japanese navy.  Featherston also continues his scheme for the \\"population reduction\\" of African-Americans in CS borders.  In the meantime, the US's German allies suffer a number of difficulties in their war with the CS's vengeance-minded friends, Britain, France, and Russia.  And nearly all belligerents seem to be racing to build the atomic bomb.      Despite having well over a dozen POV characters, Turtledove does an excellent job of keeping up the pace of the novel.  He cuts across those POVs quite skillfully, depicting the horrors of the battlefield and the difficulties of the home front.  While most are useful characters, some are certainly superfluous, and there are times that the reader will wish to know more about some aspect the war that Turtledove has not addressed.  Unusually for Turtledove, he has allowed a sense of \\"good and evil\\" to creep in.  The US, despite doing some nasty things in Canada and Utah, are far more preferable to the abomination Featherston and theCS have grown into.  Thus, the reader begins to rather idolize characters like Flora Blackford, US Congresswoman, and Irving Morrell, US general extraordinare and white knight, while we hiss Featherston his cronies.  That we have been following these characters for eight books and 30 years within those books makes those connections surprisingly deep and real.    Of course, there are some pretty obvious flaws here.  Turtledove is still far too repetitive on points that seldom need much repeating (yes, CS tobacco IS better than US tobacco, in case you didn't know), although he has noticeably curbed that at other points.  Further, as others have critiqued, Turtledove has followed our own World War II quite a bit, specifically the Eastern Front, with the CS playing Nazi Germany militarily and politically, and the US playing Russia geographically, although happily not politically and not quite militarily.  Thus, it comes as no surprise when Pittsburgh plays the role of Stalingrad.  However, Turtledove knows when to work off-script, with the death of Al Smith, the attack on Fredericksburg, and the introduction of \\"people bombs\\" a few decades early.  Thus, Turtledove doesn't allow the proceedings to become wholly predictable, although I have no doubt that the CS will lose in the end.      The main problem with this book is that it is the second book in the \\"Settling Accounts\\" series, and that it is the ninth book set in this time line.  So if you really want to start reading this series, for heaven's sake, don't start here.      However, for those who have followed, \\"Drive to the East\\" will be a nice rewarding romp in an enjoyable series.	2005-09-25
US	49102989	R1UY06IZJ3XAMV	0300079796	436320915	Yale English Monarchs - Richard III (The English Monarchs Series)	Books	3	14	16	N	N	Intelligent and Scholarly Work, but not Very Interesting	Richard III is a name that conjures up an image of pure evil on par with Hitler and Jack the Ripper.  His image has been shaped by Shakespeare (who was shaped by More among others): the crook-backed schemer, cheerfully murdering all those who stood between him and the throne, inflicting misery upon England until finally being overthrown by the heroic Henry Tudor.  As is the case with other historical figures, Richard's extreme image has invited polarized debate, with those supporting the traditional view, and newer Riccardians who insist that Richard was the Second Coming.    Charles Ross takes a more objective position, guaranteed to make neither side happy, but far more valuable to historical discourse.  On the whole, Ross concludes, Richard was not the monster of popular imagination, but rather a man who lived in politically unstable times, came to the throne by usurpation for good or for ill, but was never to achieve any substantial measure of support in England, and so never became an effective ruler.  In other words, Ross argues, Richard was a man of his times, and his times were not pleasant.  If Richard seems a bit of a monster to us, so would most of his contemporaries.      However, this approach cuts both ways, as Ross lays aside some of the more interesting points of contention surrounding Richard.  Most specifically, he pays only passing lip service to Richard's part in the death of his two young nephews, the \\"little princes in the Tower,\\" one of whom, Edward, was the rightful heir to the throne.  Ross comes down on the side of tradition, pointing out that Richard probably did have them killed (their exact fate was never really known), arguing that to keep them alive would have been dangerous to his own claim, and that Richard was too pragmatic not to kill them.  It's a valid argument, and perhaps the most responsible way of dealing with this issue in a book that Ross admits is not meant to be comprehensive.      Unfortunately, Ross spends so much timediscussing which family Richard gave what title to, and what land earned what income, the whole of the book feels very weighed down by minutia.  Indeed, Ross becomes so intent on his laundry-list which lord owned what, who had what title, who lived where, and who was loyal to Richard and his family, that he seems to have forgotten just who was the subject of this book.  He effectively distances the reader from Richard, engendering indifference.  Simply put, one of the more sordid events in Richard's reign would have injected some pep in a surprisingly lifeless book.    There is no doubt that Ross is a scholar.  However, he lays out the history in a very bland and unengaging way.  He never invites the reader to actively read his work, he simply lectures them and ignores any hands the come up for questions.  His work, while intelligent, isn't very interesting.	2005-09-25
US	49102989	R2UW431MQBTRDG	1563893673	599897778	A History of Violence	Books	5	32	33	N	N	You Have a Gun in Your Face--What Do You Do?	As other reviewers have noted, David Cronenberg's movie adaptation of \\"A History of Violence\\" will be released at the end of the year.  This is the primary reason I picked up this graphic novel tha  I passed on when it was first published.  I'm glad I did pick it up, because John Wagner and Vincent Locke have crafted a gut-wrenching story of violence and revenge that transcends its lurid subject matter.    Wagner's premise is simple.  Tom McKenna, husband and father of two,  is closing up his diner when a couple of killers attempt to rob and murder him.  Tom foils them, killing one in the process.  Naturally, he receives a great deal of publicity, which he seeks to avoid.  In short order, some very tough looking types come around looking a guy named Joey, a guy, it seems, who resembles Tom, right down to missing a finger.  What follows is a hard-boiled tale in the best tradition of Ross MacDonald or Jim Thompson, as Tom finds his past catching up to him, and trying to eat him and his family alive, while Tom does everything in his power to beat that monster back (including killing a few people).    John Wagner is a British comic book writer, most remembered as a co-creator of Judge Dredd.  That early work shows to some extent.  \\"A History of Violence\\" is, well, violent, often appallingly so, as Tom is witness to, and himself inflicts, all manner of cruelty upon human beings.  However, Wagner imbues his work with a soul.  Tom and his wife, Edie, are good people, and Wagner makes it clear that whatever Tom has done, he has paid his dues.  He deserves his happiness.  That is underscored by the appalling antagonists Tom fights.  Wagner further makes it plain that for Tom to win the final showdown, he still has to pay one last due.    Vince Locke's art is an interesting moody and sketchy style.  It is highly detailed on the one hand, and yet his line work has an almost surreal quality, reminiscent of a woodcut.  While it goes without saying the acts of violence are vivid(and almost difficult to view at times), Locke also depicts the more mundane aspects of the McKennas' lives, underscoring the everyman quality of Tom and the essentially average existence he leads.    Cronenberg has admitted in interviews that he did not know that the script for \\"A History of Violence\\" was originally a graphic novel until he and the screenwriter had gone through several drafts.  Still, the advance reviews are good.  The key to a successful translation of this GN to film is maintaining the central point:  you have a gun in your face-what do you do?	2005-08-14
US	49102989	R3IQVEZK2WZJU8	1582404879	999113364	The Walking Dead, Vol. 3: Safety Behind Bars	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Thought-provoking, Chilling, and Heart-warming All at Once	The best of the zombie movie genre (that is to say, Romero's films) usually have had a thing or two to say about human nature.  Robert Kirkman has been doing this to some extent in \\"The Walking Dead\\" all along, but perhaps more conscientiously with the third volume \\"Safety Behind Bars\\".  After the events of last volume, Rick, Lori and company find an abandoned prison which, ironically, is the perfect place to hide out from the dead wandering the world.  But there are still a few human prisoners, and while they seem a reasonable lot, it soon becomes clear that even when the dead roam outside, and humanity is on the ropes, a serial killer still feels free to act on his sick desires. <br /> <br />Kirkman's strong suit is characterization.  Indeed, this is the most important thing he brings to an otherwise standard genre piece.  His characters act and interact like real people would under these circumstances.  Despite the horror of the world, people are only so willing to trust one another, treat each other with decency, or to put their own self-interests on hold for the benefit of the survivors.  Indeed, even when circumstances would appear to be black and white, they blend into gray almost immediately. <br /> <br />Granted, Kirkman is telling a sprawling epic story here.  Not every character is important beyond eventually being cannon fodder (zombie food or otherwise).  Don't have any revelations about life and your place in the world if you're not in the top tier characters, because two pages later you will be dead.  Nonetheless, even if every character isn't the most important character, Kirkman does an excellent job of making each character distinct. <br /> <br />The artwork by Charlie Adlard and Cliff Rathburn is terrific.  They fill this volume with decayed corpses, gut-wrenching gore and death, at the same time depicting quiet moments of smiling children, happy couples, and general peace.  Particularly effective is the juxtaposition of the cold, bleak prison walls that are the only form of safety.  Naturally, we also know that the prison isn't completely safe, because there are zombies in every dark corner, and creepy convicts walking in the bright sunlight. <br /> <br />While Kirkman has taken on other comic book projects, I sincerely hope he keeps this one on the front burner.  It is thought-provoking, chilling, and, at odd-moments, heart-warming all at once.	2005-08-14
US	49102989	R2GIQ97KARAB4O	0439784549	162568542	Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6)	Books	5	4	10	N	Y	Adds New Emotional Depth to the Series	\\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" is unique among the \\"Harry Potter\\" series.  While the whole of the series has been at its core a coming-of-age tale, it has been set in a world of fantasy, with J.K Rowling emphasizing the fantasy element.  \\"The Half-Blood Prince\\" is a reversal, concentrating on Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they find themselves on the cusp of 17, the age of majority in the wizard-world.  The plot of the novel is tailored more toward growing pains than toward the war against Lord Voldemort.  However, Rowling never lets the reader forget that the pain Harry endures is directly tied to fighting the good fight. <br /> <br />At the beginning of the novel, set just weeks after the end of \\"The Order of the Phoenix,\\" Harry is still struggling with the death of Sirius Black, his godfather, while aware of the war that has begun in earnest in the wizard world, a war that has spilled over into the Muggle world.  However, Harry soon learns he has little time to grieve, as he is quickly collected by Dumbledore, discovers he passed many of his OWLs, is appointed captain of Gryffindor's quidditch team, and begins certain lessons with Dumbledore himself.  He also discovers an old textbook in his Potions class, full of spells and charms written by a previous owner simply known as \\"The Half-Blood Prince,\\" and quickly gains a great deal of skill in Potions.  <br /> <br />On the personal level, it becomes clear to Harry (as it has been clear to the reader since about book 3) that Ron and Hermione have feelings for each other, as Ron begins a relationship with a fellow student, much to Hermione's chagrin and to Harry's discomfort as he's caught in the middle.  However, Harry himself soon realizes that his feelings for Ron's sister, Ginny, may be more that of a surrogate older brother.  Complicating things further, Harry is suspicious of the behavior of Draco Malfoy, his old enemy, suspicions shared by few.  But most importantly, during his studies with Dumbledore,Harry finally learns the origins of Lord Voldemort, and why he and Voldemort are locked in a death-course that only one can survive. <br /> <br />Rowling has substantially progressed as a writer.  While all the books have been enjoyable and involving, there is a great-deal of emotional depth here.  For example, the reader is hit with the sudden realization that we have effectively watched Harry grow up, and that at the end of this novel, Harry is effectively an adult.  Ron and Hermione have begun to figure out that their feel more than mere friendship for each other, and it makes the reader smile.  Most surprisingly, Rowling actually brings a level of sympathy to her series most overt villains, Draco Malfoy. Malfoy, the snotty little bigoted aristocrat child, is in many ways a pawn, bread to be a snot, and forced into a destiny that he has no real heart to fulfill.  <br /> <br />The main emotional impact of this novel is the death of an important character to the series.  It's an open secret by now, I'm sure, but I won't say the name.  I should add that the circumstances of that character's death are such that Rowling could undo it quite plausibly.   <br /> <br />The overall story arc of the conflict between Harry and Voldemort is advanced very little.  We have Voldemort's back story, and the means by which Harry will (presumably) destroy Voldemort in the next book.  Indeed, a better title for this novel would have been \\"Harry Potter and the Legend of Voldemort\\" or something like that.  The identity of the Half-Blood Prince is never particularly tantalizing, and the revelation of that figure's real identity is basically an anticlimax.  It may be resolved in a more satisfactory way in the next book.   <br /> <br />My initial worry when reading this book is that Rowling was simply killing time before bringing the series to its conclusion.  But, as I was reading, I came to suspect that Rowling was deliberately taking a break from her overall story.  In doing so, she brought a new depth of character and emotion to the series, and has created a greater tension for the final novel, wherein Harry, Ron, and Hermione have more than their lives to lose.  Thus, Rowling has done something perhaps more adult than she has done before, and the series will greatly benefit from it.	2005-08-13

Volume 3 contains the Batman stories from \\"Detective Comics\\" #71-86, slightly over a year's worth of stories.  Bob Kane and company definitely were hitting their stride here, with many a creative plotline and some very nice art.  A couple of minor villains who have managed to keep their place in the rogues gallery, including the Cavalier and Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee make their initial bows in this volume (although the Cavalier hasn't been around since the 1980s).<br /><br />There are a quite few Joker stories.  Even then, DC knew how important this character was in the Batman mythos.  Great art from Kane, Dick Sprang and Jerry Robinson, among others.  While they're all good, \\"The Joker's Double\\" is the best written and illustrated.  It makes an interesting turn of events to have the Joker aid the side of justice to flush out an impersonator.<br /><br />\\"The Scarecrow Returns\\" seems timely, given that villain's pivotal role in the new movie.  Also of note was the early attempt to rehabilitate a Batman villain in \\"The End of Two-Face!\\" as poor Harvey (still called) Kent (not Dent) is actually cured (which we all know didn't stick).<br /><br />Suprisingly, even though Superman and Wonder Woman were slapping around Axis types left and right, Batman remained fairly apolitical, as only one, very preachy story, \\"The Bond Wagon\\" wherein Batman and Robin put together a group of Revolutionary re-enactors.  Fun, but predictable, and almost out of place.<br /><br />Like all golden age comics, plot heavy, and character lite.  But great fun, nonetheless.	2005-08-05
US	49102989	R2XTFJ3VDL1NIU	0156011190	892766246	The Big Killing (Bruce Medway Mysteries, No. 2)	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Setting, and a Talent for Misdirection Serves this Book Well	\\"The Big Killing\\" is my first Robert Wilson book.  It is the second in his series of mysteries featuring Bruce Medway, British expatriate living in the Ivory Coast.  Since it was in the bargain book section, I went ahead and picked up the third and fourth books.  However, I'm not so sure if that was a bit of a hasty decision in the end.    When we first meet Medway, he's a bit of a mess.  Evidently, the events of the first book, \\"Instruments of Darkness\\" (which I have not read) have left him a disillusioned (although I doubt that he was ever \\"illusioned\\"), adrift in the Ivory Coast, broke, pining for his lost love, and waiting for his Syrian millionaire patron to give him something to do.  In the meantime, the Liberian Civil War is raging, with one of its apparent casualties begin the Liberian VP, found with his innards ripped out by a killer simply dubbed \\"The Leopard\\".     Naturally, as is the case in such novels, Medway finds he has three jobs all at once.  His Syrian millionaire friend wants him to check on the manager of his sheanut plantation.  An old friend from England asks Medway to chaperone a young diamond merchant.  And a repugnant pornographer asks Medway to deliver a package.  These diverse plot-threads soon converge in a political tangle, as Medway maneuvers his way through the thoroughly corrupt world of West Africa.    The plot is quite brisk, if convoluted.  Medway stumbles into ambushes, tangles with corrupt village police, dodges a massive kidnapping plot, all while the bodies pile up around him.  Numerous characters enter the stage, although only a few actually seem to have any bearing on the overall novel.  Wilson is very good at playing with the reader's perceptions and stereotypes, as some characters who seem as if they're going to be critical to the overall plot wind-up dead within a few pages of their introduction.  Other characters who seem as if they are merely in the novel to provide background color actually prove extraordinarily relevant.  This talent for misdirection serves Wilson well, as he keeps the reader enticed by the enigma of his novel as we try to figure what's going on with Medway.    It's fortunate that this novel is so plot-driven, because Medway is not a terribly strong character.  While drawn from the writings of old school hard-boiled fiction, Medway feels as if he's lacking something.   He never quite appears to be the moral White Knight Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe is.  Nor is ever the self-righteous tough guy who is willing to bloody his hands for justice like Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer.  While he seems an okay guy, Medway seems to simply be going through the motions, playing tough-guy detective, tangling with cops, killers, and dames.  While that's part of Wilson's intent early on, he never really gives Medway anything to strive for, beyond simple survival.  Medway never really seems to care about the various people dying around him, but he seeks justice for them nonetheless.  His code is perhaps too fuzzy to understand, and that might have been Wilson's goal, but Wilson did the character no favors by not letting him grow within the course of the book.    The real draw of this book (and I suspect the whole series) is the setting.  West Africa is no paradise, and Wilson shows us this.  It's corrupt and violent, with miles of distance between the haves and the have-nots.  Despite the fact that it has been decades since the region has been under direct European Imperial rule, one of the central issues, Wilson reminds us, is that the Europeans never left.  They come back, fulfill their own interests (be it diamonds, be it political instability), and then leave while West Africa is force to pick up the pieces.  Moreover, Wilson also makes it clear that this situation exists because native born African elites benefit by it.  But even more basically, Wilson evokes a place that is hot, humid, and depressed.  Wilson's efforts to instill a sense of indignation in his reader isa success.    On the whole, I did like \\"The Big Killing,\\" although not as much as I expected to when I flipped through it.  That's a little unfair on my part, I suppose.  Hopefully, with more realistic expectations, I can enjoy the rest of the Medway series.	2005-07-30
US	49102989	R32GZYYXMXFUGQ	0812579259	606443502	The Keep	Books	2	5	11	N	N	A Literary Shell Game	F. Paul Wilson's \\"The Keep\\" has a pretty solid reputation in the horror genre.  Certainly, the premise is intriguing:  Nazis arrive at a keep in Romania in anticipation of \\"Operation: Barbarossa,\\" release something evil, and one by one become victims.  But something happens in the last third of the book:  a novel that has been a legitimately creepy Lovecraftian horror novel abruptly becomes a stand Howard bit of sword and sorcery.  The end result is unsatisfactory.   <br /> <br />At this point, I will issue a \\"SPOILER ALERT!\\"  I just can't discuss this novel, and my frustration with it without examining some of the key plot points. <br /> <br />As I said, it starts quite nicely. Erich Kaempffer, a sturmbannfurher of the SS, has been given a new assignment.  He is to go to the Dinu Pass in Romania to investigate a telegram from Captain Klaus Woermann to the high command, stating that \\"something is murdering my men.\\"  Woermann has occupied a mysterious keep, one with an unusual history:  it has been kept immaculate for centuries by the locals, in the employ of parties unknown.  It is surrounded by unusual crosses.  Birds refuse to nest in it.  And anyone who attempts to stay the night is given to bad dreams.  Naturally, the Germans disregard this.  One greedy fool goes poking around, opens a chamber, and promptly has his head torn off.  Over the next week, a victim is taken each night.   <br /> <br />Kaempffer, who is bucking for a promotion to his own death camp, grudgingly takes the assignment.  Kaempffer and Woermann have a great deal of animosity between them, stemming from Kaempffer's acts in the First World War.  That is exacerbated by Woermann's disdain for the Nazi part and Hitler.   <br /> <br />However, Kaempffer proves just as impotent to prevent the grisly murders.  So, Theodor Cuza, an expert on the region, and his daughter, Magda are summoned.  The tension is further heightened by Cuza's poor health and the fact that father and daughter are Jewish.  And,a mysterious man, simply called Glenn, who \\"knows\\" the truth of the keep, soon arrives. <br /> <br />And from here, the novel becomes less horror and more adventure.  Cuza soon encounters the monster.  Everyone believes it to be a vampire, but in fact it is something far more sinister.  And it soon becomes clear that its influence is unhealthy to Cuza, as he grows more enchanted with the notion of using the monster to destroy Hitler, while growing suspicious of Magda's relationship with Glenn.   <br /> <br />The major problem with this novel is the structure of the narrative.  Wilson starts the novel squarely focused on Woermann and Kaempffer as antagonists forced to put aside their relationship to fight the horror.  However, as the novel progresses, it soon becomes clear that the real heroes of the novel are Magda and Glenn.  Which is frustrating because Glenn is never really drawn fully as a character.  Magda is reasonably solid, but Wilson reiterates many times just how much she has given up for her father, how strong she is inside, and how unattractive to men she thinks she is.  In the meantime the sympathetic Woermann and the evil Kaempffer are simply dropped when they have served their purpose to the narrative, without any real sense of closure, despite effectively carrying the novel from page one. <br /> <br />Another problem is the switch in genre.  With Glenn's arrival, and the truth revealed, the horror vanishes, and instead we get what must have been the inspiration for \\"Highlander.\\"  I really don't want to go too much further into it, but, suffice to say, I really wished that the monster had been a simple vampire.   <br /> <br />Wilson can tell an entertaining story.  It's just the sense that I had been playing some sort of literary shell game when I finished the book that really bothered me.  This is a shame, because I really felt as if there was the germ of a great idea here.  It just was never allowed to grow organically.	2005-07-15
US	49102989	R3QQY0NBM5OFH1	1582404135	593518819	The Walking Dead, Vol. 2: Miles Behind Us	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Maybe the Best Zombie Movie Ever, and it's a Comic Book!	I have a confession to make.  I have no intention of seeing \\"George A. Romero's Land of the Dead\\" in the theaters.  A couple of years ago, I would have been just as rabidly intent on seeing this film as one of the ghouls shambling around on screen. But the genre has suddenly been saturated, and I'm a little burned out, particularly as each film follows a basic pattern:  \\"zombies appear, civilization crumbles, people take refuge, make stupid mistakes that pick them off one by one, last group of protagonists appear to escape only to die\\".  In the meantime, the audience is treated to scenes of grotesque zombies engaged in gory consumption of victims before being shot in the head, and victims of bites disintigrating in zombiedom themselves.    The sole zombie story I still enjoy is \\"Walking Dead\\".  At first glance, that may be a little counter-intuitive.  It follows the formula--zombies have appeared, civilization has crumbled, and a few survivors are moving along, trying to survive, occasionally getting picked off by errent zombies.  The zombies can only be done in by a bullet to the head (or an axe or whatever).  However, Robert Kirkman has two distinct advantages in telling his story in the comic book format:  time to allow his characters to grow, and the talent to make the reader care about their growth.  In other words, \\"The Walking Dead\\" may be the best zombie movie ever, and it's a comic book!    It's just that simple, and it's why I heartily recommend this series.  It's cliched beyond belief, but it's so well-done that the cliches hardly matter.    Of course, every story has to have its hero, even an ensemble cast like this one.  And Rick, former police officer, is a sterling example of humanity.  Not perfect by any means, but as manner characters point out, a pillar of strength for his extended family.    \\"Miles Behind Us\\" is very episodic, as Rick and his group leave the Atlanta area and begin a migration, looking for food and shelter, while dodging zombies, adding more stragglers to their ranks, and losing others to attacks.  In other words, Kirkman concentrates on telling the kind of story that you really can't tell in a two hour film.  While the format doesn't allow for the \\"jump\\" moments, wherein monsters suddenly appear to eat someone, the constant threat, the empathy Kirkman creates, and the alarming cast turnover keeps the reader in a state of heightened suspense.      Of course, half of the success of this series is the artwork. Charlie Adlard's art is excellent, conveying the generally exhausted state of the characters, the desolation of the world they live in, the decomposition of the zombies, and the horror of the attacks.  Every panel is chilling and ominous.      So, speaking for myself, I'm content to stay home and get my zombie movie fix from Messrs. Kirkman and Adlard.	2005-07-02
US	49102989	R2QUY3BA3DRWDH	0375713549	835531493	Fletch	Books	4	15	15	N	N	Great Dialogue and a Great Protaganist Mean a Great Book	I've seen the Chevy Chase movie, although it's been years. I remember it having some good one-liners, etc., although it was not a \\"great\\" film. Still, bargain bins are great things, and this book was too good a bargain to pass up.    I. M. Fletcher, \\"Fletch\\" to his friends, is a reporter chasing a drug story on the beaches of California. Here, he is approached by Alan Stanwyck, wealthy businessman, about doing a favor. It seems Stanwyck is dying of cancer, and wants Fletch to kill him at the end of the week. Fletch, intrigued, agrees. He naturally investigates Stanwyck while juggling the drug story, dealing with an editor he has no respect for (rightfully so), and dodging his ex-wives' (yes, wives plural) lawyers.     Let's face it, the real draw here is the dialogue. Kevin Smith is among many people who have said they learned how to write great dialogue from Gregory McDonald. And it's not hard to see why, as McDonald has a gift it. He simply lets his characters talk. There are no adjectives, adverbs, \\"he said,\\" \\"she said\\" in his pages of speaking. He simply chooses his words (or his characters do), and everything is left to the reader to \\"see\\" and \\"hear\\"--tone, body language, etc. And it keeps the reader turning the page, hoping not to get caught in the crossfire as Fletch trades barbs with whatever \\"lesser\\" being he is forced to deal with as he pursues both stories.    Which isn't to say the plot is lacking. It's quite gripping. Actually the two disparate plot-lines are gripping, as Fletch moves in and out of his investigations, using solid detective work and a great deal of duplicity to get answers. Unlike the film, the two stories Fletch chases don't come together in any meaningful way, but the chase is in and of itself fun. Indeed, even if you have seen the film, you will be surprised at how different the many details of the book differ from the film. They are almost two different stories.    And in many ways, the Fletch of the book is very different from the character of the film. As I read the book, I was never quite sure if I liked Fletch as a person. He refuses to pay alimony (never quite clear if it was because he couldn't or simply wouldn't), he has a relationship with a 15-year-old girl who is a drug-addict that doesn't seem terribly healthy, he hates his editor, and he demonstrates just generally misanthropic tendencies, with little obvious reason. But, somehow, he won me over, and so I was rooting for the guy to finally overcome all the obstacles in his life, the most important obstacle being the entire human race.     While I am not in a huge hurry to read the next book in the series, I do think I will eventually. Fletch is an interesting character, and I am very curious about the course of his career.	2005-06-26
US	49102989	R35ZWMHHC32HGJ	0345461525	782615868	The Bloody Crown of Conan (Conan of Cimmeria, Book 2)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Great Conan Stories	\\"The Bloody Crown of Conan\\" is the second collection of Robert E. Howard's classic character published by DelRey.  It contains three stories, including the only Conan novel \\"The Hour of the Dragon\\", as well as the novella \\"The People of the Black Circle\\", and the shorter \\"A Witch Shall be Born.\\"  While I'm not sure if any of these rank highly as personal favorites, they are all entertaining, rousing, and even chilling.   <br /> <br />Because there are only three stories, it's relatively easy to critique each story, as opposed to the first collection. <br /> <br />Naturally, \\"Hour of the Dragon\\" is the centerpiece of this collection:  nearly 200 glorious pages of intrigue, fantasy, horror, and war.  Conan, king of Aquilonia, finds himself unseated from his thrown when a group of plotters, led by Valerius, a Aquilonian duke, resurrect Xalotun, a long-dead wizard, who uses his powers to defeat Conan.  Taken prisoner, Conan escapes, and sets upon a quest for a magic amulet with the power to destroy Xalotun.  Through the course of this episodic novel, Conan encounters evil in various forms, especially in the dark land of Stygia, where he meets giant snakes, vampire women, and evil priests.  Through this, he comes to understand the importance of his tenure as king to the people of Aquilonia, as they are subject to tyranny by the gang of usurpers.  Indeed, \\"The Hour of the Dragon\\" represents an interesting level of growth in the character.  Even though Howard did not write these stories with any sort of chronology, he have taken into consideration how the character would have changed throughout his life.  Stories that take place early in Conan's life reveal a basic callowness.  He's a thief and adventurer, essentially thumbing his nose at so-called civilization.  However, by the time of \\"The Hour of the Dragon\\", a more mature Conan has emerged, one who acts in the interests of justice and altruism as much as in his own self-aggrandizement.   <br /> <br />Don't worry, the young Conan is present in the other two pieces, particularly in the creepy \\"The People of the Black Circle.\\"  Here, Howard tells the story of Conan in his free-booting days.  After the death of the king of Vendhya by black magic, his sister Yasmina ascends the throne.  However, she soon finds herself under the power of Conan, whose bandits have been plaguing the kingdom.  Initially seeking to ransom the queen, Conan instead finds himself in an uneasy alliance with Yasmina when the evil sorcerers who murdered her brother seek to kill her as well. <br /> <br />A slightly more mature Conan is present in \\"A Witch Shall Be Born\\".  The story itself is pretty basic, as another queen, Taramis of Khauran, is replaced by her evil twin sister, Salome, a witch.  The real centerpiece of this story is the crucifixion of Conan (here, the captain of Tarmis' guards) by Salome's ally Constantius.  Naturally, Conan survives the grisly death (although he at one point rips out a vulture's throat with his teeth), and he raises an army of bandits, while inside, people subject to Salome's degrading rule quickly realize that their queen has been replaced.  While most critics tend not to give this story too much credit, I found it fascinating that this story, much like \\"The Hour of the Dragon\\" concerns itself with the theme of good leadership and the dangers of arbitrary rulers.  \\"A Witch Shall be Born\\" also sees Howard experimenting with narration, including a lengthy letter by a diplomat to Khauran describing the horrors under the rule of Salome.  So I would argue the story has more value than perhaps the critics give it.   <br /> <br />The various illustrations and plates by artist Gary Gianni are excellent and add to the pleasure of the collection.  Also, the various editorial material, including essays examining Howard's creative process and business concerns as he wrote the stories, as well as various rough drafts and summaries, are interesting insights into the stories, and thus, greater enjoyment. <br /> <br />I eagerly await the next (last?) volume in the series.  Howard was first-rate, and it's terrific that DelRey is making these stories available.	2005-06-20
US	49102989	R3TB5EVG56THH1	1401204740	665268202	Wrath of the Spectre	Books	4	17	17	N	N	A Grisly Hoot	If there is such a thing as a \\"big Spectre fan\\", I'm probably one.  I enjoy the character anyway, and one of my fondest memories of the 1990s was reading John Ostrander's excellent \\"Spectre\\" series from DC Comics.  That series was a nice blend of horror, super-heroics, and philosophical moralizing.      So when DC published a collection of the Spectre stories that ran in \\"Adventure Comics\\" in the early 1970s, I gleefully snapped it up.     For those not familiar with the Spectre (which would be the vast majority of people who are not comic book readers), the Spectre is Jim Corrigan, a police officer killed in the 1940s, but returned to Earth with the purpose of eradicating evil (see \\"The Golden Age Spectre Archives\\").  His is given nearly unlimited power to achieve that end, ususally punishing evil-doers by killing them in creative and gruesome ways.  Unfortunately, as super-heroes went into decline, the Spectre was the first to vanish (the fact that the strip had been taken over by a dofus sidekick didn't help).  DC did bring him back in the early 60s, concentrating on his more super-hero aspect.  But it was in the 1970s that DC attempted to return the more horrifying aspects to the character.  These are collected in this volume.    On the whole, I enjoyed this collection.  Michael Fleisher's scripts are simple and to the point.  Basically, Corrigan, still acting as a New York City detective, comes across some very ghastly crime, involving cruel and wanton murders, and chases down the guilty parties, executing them grotesquely.  These villains themselves range from the mundane, like bank robbers to the more frequently disturbing, like a mannequin maker, whose creations come to life and commit mass murder, or a nutty scientist who wants to make museum displays representing aspects of society, with stuffed innocents to make up these displays.    Given the period these stories are from, Fleisher's character development isn't as strong as it could be.  On the other hand, it's a little better developed than your average DC comic from the period (although they were getting better).  In between turning people to glass or cutting them in half with scissors, Corrigan finds himself negatively impacting people around him, including a young woman, Gwen Sterling, who is in love with him.  Given Corrigan's status as a dead man, that can never be.  Corrigan is also plagued by reporter Earl Crawford, who quickly realizes that there is something super-natural murdering criminals in the city.  Crawford follows this scoop to his detriment, risking his life, freedom, and sanity.    Of course, none of these scripts would have worked if the art wasn't so great.  Jim Aparo (one of my personal favorite artists) knows how to convey mood, action, and general creepiness throughout the procedings.  It's great to see so much of his work in one place like this.    I'm not sure this series fits into present DC continuity.  Given some remarks that indicated Superman was fiction in the story, I'm not sure if it fit into then-DC continuity.  Still, even if these stories don't \\"exist\\", their spirt lives on, in the form of Ostrander's Spectre, and the rampaging monster found in DC's \\"Day of Vengeance\\", running now.      Regardless, its value does not lie in where it fits in, but that it exists at all.  It came at a time when both comic companies were putting their toes back into the horror pool, and its run was probably much too short.  It's just a grisly hoot.  I hope DC brings back more of their seventies horror comics, and finally reprint Ostranders \\"Spectre\\".	2005-06-12
US	49102989	R3P0YJWRKLUTJ0	1595820124	832214217	Vampire Hunter D, Vol. 1	Books	3	67	75	N	N	Not Great Literature, but Great Fun Nonetheless	While I know many Americans are familiar with the manga \\"Vampire Hunter D\\", the popular series of Japanese novels have finally been translated into English and are being published in the US.  This novel, set in the year AD 12,090, is an entertaining mix of genres, most importantly post-apocalyptic futurism and basic horror, with little sword and sorcery thrown in.       Vampires have ruled humanity since the 21th century, after humanity initiated the last world war.  Now their time is coming to an end, humanity is reasserting itself, and specially trained humans are needed to kill the various monsters, mutants, and vampires that still prey on mankind.      D (the only name he is given) is such a hunter.  D is a dhampir, the off-spring of a vampire father and a human mother.  With his tremendous supernatural powers, D agrees to help young farm girl Doris fend of the ammorous attentions of Count Magnus Lee, one of the few vampires to rule his domain.      First, the unpleasant truth.  This isn't a particulary well-written book.  There is the caveat that this is a _translated_ work.  However, I suspect that this was a pretty literal translation.  Stylistically, Kikuchi seems to be heavily influenced by 19th century European works as well as early 20th century pulp ficion--many of the turns of phrase, elaborate description of setting, reminded me of an imitation of H.P. Lovecraft imitating Charles Dickens.  Kikuchi has an interesting tendency to editorialize about the qualities of his characters:  the villains are evil, he states over and over, and the heroes are good.  Consequently, the character development is enough to keep the action going.        This may sound negative, but it's not meant to be.  So the stuff ain't Shakespeare.  I did enjoy the novel, even if its artistic merit is limited.  The action sequences are vividly described, the plot is intriguing, there's a fair ammount of suspense, and the characters are likeable.  The dialog is servicable, but never really clangs on the ears.  In a sense, \\"Vampire Hunter D\\" is comparable to a summer blockbuster.  Its light, fun, and keeps the reader turning the pages.    One big problem I had was the formatting.  There was not a hyphen to be found, and so the end margins were uneven.  Hopefully DH Publishing will clean this up for the rest of the series, as it was a distraction.      I do look forward to the next novel in the series.  I don't think I've signed on as a fan, so to speak, but there are worse ways to spend the afternoon.	2005-06-03

Much like the Dredd-verse, \\"Strontium Dog\\" is set in a distant post-apocalyptic future.  After a nuclear war, strontium-90 pollutes the landscape, causing genetic mutations.  These mutants are outcasts (shades of \\"X-men\\"), with very few rights.  Their only option to get ahead is bounty hunting, becoming Strontium Dogs.   <br /> <br />The protagonist of this series is Johnny Alpha, whose mutation allows him to see through anything, including into people's minds.  His partner is Wulf, a normal person with great strength and a stereotypical Scandanavian accent.  Also in tow is a creature known as the Gronk, an alien with great healing abilities, very little physical courage, and a penchant for speaking like Jar Jar Binks.   <br /> <br />While Johnny Alpha's world is not quite the biting satire that Judge Dredd is, it is an action-packed one.  First, Johnny and his group are taken captive by a savage warrior race.  Then, while on the trail of a rogue strontium dog, Johnny and his gang must fight their way through a hell-like dimension.  Finally, Johnny travels back in time to capture that arch-fiend, Adolph Hitler.   <br /> <br />This volume is a nice action-packed romp.  If you like Judge Dredd, you'll like this.	2005-06-01
US	49102989	R2VTWZJJ0794KI	1401205887	861679184	Judge Anderson: Anderson, PSI-Division - VOL 01	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A Thorough Blast to Read	I'm getting why 2000 AD and Judge Dredd are so popular.  The stories aren't spectacularly original.  But they are well-plotted, well-characterized, and are always just a blast to read.   <br /> <br />Case in point:  \\"Judge Anderson:  Anderson-Psi Division\\", which  collects three story arcs from Judge Anderson's solo adventures.  Judge Casandra Anderson is a denzien of a distant post-apocalyptic future, wherein the surviving population has been jammed into Mega cities.  These cities are patrolled by judges, the best and the brightest the city has to offer.  These judges are given the power to enforce the law, convict felons, and execute sentences, all on the spot.  Some judges have various psionic abilites, which are useful to solving and preventing crime.  Unlike Judge Dredd, Anderson is a character with a sense of humor, and certain warmth.  That doesn't stop her from being a tough-as-nails badass when the situation calls for it. <br /> <br />In the first story, \\"Four Dark Judges\\", Anderson becomes increasingly concerned that Judge Death and his cronyies are attempting to return.  Her efforts to prevent that make matters worse.  In \\"The Sacrifice\\", Anderson attempts to save a boy from demonic possession, but must face a no-win situation.  And in \\"Hour of the Wolf\\", Anderson keeps getting images of a giant wolf attacking Mega-City 1, as a conspiracy of revenge is set in motion with her as a primary target. <br /> <br />Despite the elaborate background of these stories, they're self-contained.  If this is your first experience with the \\"Dreddverse\\", you won't be overwhelmed by continutiy or backstory.  They're also actioned-packed hoots, with a solid ammount of satire and violence built in.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, since DC is no longer publishing 2000 AD material, I have no idea when a volume two might be published, or by who.  Still, it's worth your while to have the first one.	2005-05-22

Neither are very interested, mainly because they can feel the bad ending coming, and the events of the previous novels in the series have left plenty of scars.  However, after some preliminary investigations, the PIs agree to join the hunt.  In typical Lehane fashion, it soon becomes obvious that there is much more to the girl's disappearance than anyone suspected, as Kenzie and Genarro encounter the girls oblivious drug-addict mother, who is beholden to a dangerous drug-dealer, two very driven cops, and a whole lot of violence. <br /> <br />As I said, I'm not sure how I feel about this book, which means, oddly enough, Lehane succeeded in his goals.  The ending is realistic given the plot and completely true to the characters' motivations and personalities.  Without giving away anything, as has been the case in the previous books in this series, justice is served, but unlike the previous books, innocent parties are punished with the guilty ones.  I personally was left feeling very torn ethically, vaguely wanting Kenzie and Genarro to lose this one, but not really.   <br /> <br />As I think about this book, there also a noticeable lack of a solidly defined antagonist, as in the previous books.  The villains here aren't all people who seek power and take pleasure in the pain of others as is the case in other books.  Some, unfortunately, are people who seem to be doing the wrong thing for the right reasons.  This is actually to the benefit of the book, as we root for the heroes out of reflex, but aren't always certain we should be doing so. <br /> <br />\\"Gone, Baby, Gone\\" stands as perhaps Lehane's most successful Kenzie/Genarro outing, thematically speaking.  You won't leave this book wanting for suspense or thrills.  You'll also find yourself on the horns of an ethical dilemma.  Truly a successful hard-boiled thriller.	2005-05-19

It's just a nice, heartwarming story, as Owly and Wormy try to extend a helping hand to a family of blue jays, who are naturally suspicious of the normally predatory owl.  I will conclude with a quote from my review of the first volume:  \\"Go read it.  If you don't like it, you may have no soul.\\"	2005-05-08
US	49102989	R3NWDPCGPBYZDK	0440178002	191357398	Shogun (Asian Saga)	Books	5	9	11	N	N	On the whole a wonderful book	I've never had any particular desire to read anything by James Clavell.  But one day I was in the bookstore, I decided it had been a long time since I had read a lengthy epic novel, and figured what the heck.  The reputation \\"Shogun\\" carries certainly didn't hurt.      By and large, the reputation is deserved.  \\"Shogun\\" is on the whole a wonderful book.  Clavell, while perhaps not a \\"great\\" writer, is an extremely good one.  He has a strong sense for description, dialogue, and characterization, which make the 1152 pages go by quite quickly and enjoyably.      John Blackthorne, an English sailor, manages to bring his ship to 1600 AD Japan.  Almost immediately, Blackthorne finds himself in conflict with the precarious Japanese government, the alien Japanese society, and the jealously influential Portugese traders and mercenaries who have staked a claim.  In order to survive, Blackthorne must adopt elements of Japanese culture, while making himself valuable to Toranaga, the most powerful daiymo of Japan.      While Clavell took the plot of his novel from history, he also fictionalized quite a bit.  Nearly every major character in the novel is based on a historical person.  Toranaga is in fact Tokugawa, whose family took control of the shogunate, and with it control of Japan, for nearly 300 years.  Blackthorne is loosely based on William Adams, who helped open up Japan to greater foreign trade.  I'm not sure why Clavell took this approach, and for a little while, it's a bit of a distraction.    Clavell's greatest strength is examining the various political games the protagonists play.  Toranaga knows early on he is going to be a war with various rivals among the Council of Regents, and Blackthorne's arrival becomes an immediate benefit to Torananga's plans.  Blackthorne finds himself raging at the xenophobic elements of Japanese society that view him as a barbarian, while fending off the Portuguese attempts to capture or kill him.  He also falls in love with Mariko, a woman who is descended from an honorable samurai family, but who is also a Christian convert.  Mariko herself is torn between her duty to her country and her liege lord, Toranaga, and her newly adopted faith, while reciprocating Blackthorne's love.      Blackthorne's transformation from English \\"barbarian\\" into a \\"civilized\\" samurai is one of the most interesting and realistic progressions in fiction.  The change in the Anjin-san (as Blackthorne is called) is a gradual thing, as Blackthorne struggles with the language barrier and customs, coming to accept the better elements of the Japanese society, while becoming more disenchanted with his own heritage.  But at the same time he clings to the possibility of returning to England, covered in gold and glory for opening the door to the east for his native land.  He never quite realizes that only one route is truly open to him.      My only complaint is that I never felt completely connected to the characters.  While I did like them, I was surprised that upon the deaths of a few major characters, I was not as emotionally impacted as in other fictional works (Larry McMurtry's \\"Lonesome Dove\\" was always heartbreaking, for example).  There were also times that I wondered if every conversation about scheming and political maneuvering was necessary.  I was also irritated by Clavell's occasional use of minor characters as a means of moving the plot forward.  For example, the wife of the villainous Yabu figures out very quickly certain hows and whys of Toranaga's plans.  She never appears after this Lady Macbeth-moment, and really, the book only moves forward marginally.  Also, I have to say, I would have liked to see the war proper.  Clavell actually recounts this entire event in a couple of paragraphs on the last page of the book.  Considering the whole novel has been leading up to this war, I felt a little frustrated.          However, none of these complaints really overshadowed my enjoyment of this novel, or my rating.  I will certainly be reading the rest of Clavell's \\"Asian Saga\\", though not right away.	2005-05-06
US	49102989	R97TZ17KMMM3M	1401205801	102078003	Judge Dredd: Dredd VS. Death (Judge Dredd (Graphic Novels))	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A Perfect Sampler of Judge Dredd's World; Bolland is GOD	I'm a little confused as to why DC hasn't simply done a series of comprehensive reprints of Judge Dredd, as they have with the other 2000 AD properties.  Oh well, you take what you can get.    I'm not an expert on Dredd, but I do have a little experience with the character (outside the terrible Stallone movie), and this volume is a perfect intro to Dredd and his world.  The violence, the snarky humor, the break-neck plots, it's all here, as Dredd battles the vile Judge Death, who has decided all living things break the law, and so must be punished by Death.  Dredd also gets to police \\"The First Lunar Olympics\\", a particularly amusing bit of satire, as atheletes are scanned for drugs AND bionic enhancements beyond the permitted 20%.  The image of a boarder falling off the ramp and onto the pavement at 200+ mph is amusing in its gore.  Another brilliant satire is \\"The Oxygen Board\\", as a group of crooks look like they've gotten away with the perfect robbery on the moon, until one is informed his oxygen bill is late.  It's refreshing to read stories that pack a wallop in about 10 pages or so, particularly in this day of \\"decompressed\\" plots running multiple issues so common in comics.    While John Wagner and Alan Grant's stories are a hoot, the real attraction of this particular collection is the artwork of Brian Bolland (maybe it should have been called \\"Judge Dredd:  The Bolland Collection\\").  His pencils are some of the most detailed and realistic around.  Every grostesque fight, bizarre alien, and elaborate spaceship is a joy to behold.  Because Bolland has become almost exclusively a cover artist, this collection is that much more of a gem.      While I understand the more patchwork approach to Dredd DC has taken (there's a lot of material, some of it more in demand than others), I hope DC does get around to being more comprehensive.  But if not, great collections like this will do nicely.	2005-04-11

Even the most obvious thing we take for granted now had to come in some great flash of insight to a pioneer or desperate soul, or both.  And then we all sit around going \\"well duh, why didn't I think of that.\\"<br /><br />\\"The World's Finest Comics Archives\\" is an excellent example of this.  Superman and Batman had been HUGE hits in comics.  Even when super-heroes were winding down at the end of the Golden Age, these two were still going strong in multiple titles, including \\"World's Finest\\".  They were even sharing the cover, and had been for over a decade.  And yet, they had not met in a story.  Even though DC/National had put together several super-heroes early in the 1940s and called it the Justice Society of America, somehow the editors didn't think to bring together their two big guns until the 1950s.<br /><br />Maybe it was the times.  Super-heroes had gone dormant.  EC's horror line had taken hold, only to be kicked in the teeth by concerned parents, a German shrink, and the Senate.  Maybe now was the best time to get these two together.<br /><br />And when they did get together, whoa brother!  The result was a huge blast of fun and adventure, in the plot and action driven style common to DC Comics, as all-powerful Superman and non-powered Batman met and saved the day, all while sharing quips and smiles.<br /><br />The stories are all fun, but have to take them as you find them.  The folks at DC knew how to play on Superman's great powers and Batman's excellent detective skills.  Don't presume the modern (and probably more realistic) post-Crisis approach of a relationship built on respect and a little distrust.  These characters were the best of friends, and a great deal of sacrifice and concern went into their adventures (maybe with a hint of competition).  Superman and Batman were not above lying to the other if it meant keeping the other safe.  But that was the most conflicted their relationship ever got.<br /><br />Great stores need great art, and this volume boasts not one, but two classic artists:  Curt Swan (primarily a Superman artist) and Dick Sprang (who cut his teeth on Batman).  Each knows how to tell a crisp, clean story, always concious of the whimsy and fun of bringing such two fantastic characters together.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this volume.  The Silver Age hadn't quite started yet, but you can see a transition in this volume from the Golden Age \\"down to earth\\" quality to the more \\"sci-fi\\" Silver Age.  The result is an excellent archive.not one, but two classic artists:  Curt Swan (primarily a Superman artist) and Dick Sprang (who cut his teeth on Batman).

One would think that the story that followed would be fascinating.  Unfortunately, the story found in \\"Killing Grin\\" represents a pretty basic, cliche story with little in the way of a pay-off. <br /> <br />Owen Young is a detective in the Denver Police Department.  He's precognitive, using visions of future events to prevent crimes, or at least to apprehend the criminals in the immediate aftermath of their crimes.  However, when Owen and his partner capture a telekinetic, the perp uses his powers to dredge up a dark secret Owen is carrying.  The revelation of that secret leads to chaos for Owen and his colleagues, as they debate whether to take cross the ultimate line to protect Owen's life and career.   <br /> <br />I picked this story up based on the strength of its setting, its art, and good word-of-mouth.  I'm a Denver native, and the number of comic books set in Denver is minuscule.  After flipping though the book, the art just blew me away.  Juan Ferreyra is a talented artist.  His line work is a photo-realistic style that is  absolutely fantastic.  Further, it was a pleasure to see numerous Denver landmarks depicted in a comic book. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Jason Rand's story just doesn't click.  The \\"cop with a dark secret contemplating murder\\" storyline has been done in just about every medium of fiction.  The story felt like a weak episode of \\"NYPD Blue\\" with mental powers.  Despite that, if the characters had been a little more solidly developed, I still might have enjoyed it. They aren't.  The characters are mostly stereotypes, none of whom are ever quite likeable or sympathetic.  As such, the book never retained my interest.   <br /> <br />I really wanted to like this book.  But ultimately, it was nothing but pretty pictures with limited story that never clicks.   <br />	2005-04-04

That's because that the editorial offices of DC never seemed to interested in him after the 1970s.  Yeah, he popped up on occasion in \\"Justice League of America\\" or any series or story that featured aliens (e.g., the 1980s crossover series \\"Invasion!\\") where Adam Strange would be useful. <br /> <br />Then in 2004, DC began publishing a nifty mini-series about their space hero.  And to tie in, they released an archive edition.  And both are great. <br /> <br />As the other reviews pointed out, Adam Strange is an Earthman who is periodically transported to the planet of Rann, and to his lady-love, Alanna.  Naturally, Adam frequently battles menaces to Rann's safety, usually in the form of bizarre aliens attempting to conquer Rann, or the occasional menace grown on Rann.  Of course, Adam is far better equipped to handle these evils than your average Rannian.   <br /> <br />That sounds derisive, although it's not meant to be.  Like most comics of the Silver Age, Adam Strange followed a formula, and it worked for the strip.  The stories are clever actioners by DC stalwart Garnder Fox with nice art by first Mike Sekowsky, and brilliant art by Carmine Infantino.  Plus, Adam is an empathetic character.  He's never able to stay on Rann for very long, and spends much of his time on Earth waiting for the next zeta-beam to take him to Rann and Alanna.  And when he does arrive, he's only there long enough to save the day and vanish again.   <br /> <br />Again, DC has done an excellent job of diversifying its Archive line.  I hope, given renewed interest in Adam Strange by both the editors and the readers alike, that more volumes of this archive series come out sooner rather than later.	2005-04-01

It contains several smaller stories that advance further many of the overall plot lines lingering about Fabletown.   <br /> <br />First, we learn of Cinderella's more devious nature in \\"Cinderella Libertine\\".  The less said about this story, the better, simply because its impact lies in its ending.  No point spoiling it. <br /> <br />Next, we get a couple of \\"War Stories\\", as we follow Bigby Wolf into his past as a spy for the Allies during World War II, on a mission that never officially happened, as Bigby leads a squad of American troops to a castle behind enemy lines. <br /> <br />Finally is \\"The Mean Seasons\\" proper, as King Cole discovers he was perhaps not as popular as a mayor as he thought, and his successor, Prince Charming, learns actually governing a city requires a lot more than charm.  His new administration, including Beauty and the Beast, also find the elaborate system that Snow White and Bigby have in place to keep the city running smoothly.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Snow White gives birth to Bigby's litter, moves to the Farm (where the \\"nonhuman\\" looking Fables must stay) and meets her father-in-law.  Others leave Fabletown for various reasons, including Bigby, who is not allowed on the Farm.  And some invisible creature is killing various residents of Fabletown. <br /> <br />While \\"March of the Wooden Soldiers\\" was and is my favorite storyline, I have to say that I found \\"Mean Seasons\\" to have quite the emotional impact.  Writer Bill Willingham, after carefully building the status quo of the series for three years, has swept it away, while paying attention to the logical consequences of those changes.   The result is a very touching volume in this excellent series.   <br /> <br />DC has wisely fast-tracked this series for trade-paperback format.  That's a good thing, since it's an excellent series.  I anticipate future volumes.	2005-03-26

While I was pleased by this particular collection, I wasn't exacltly knocked out by it.  There are three really great stories about Gaiman's Endless family.  The Death, Delirium, and Dream stories were very much the type of story that Gaiman told in his \\"Sandman\\" series, using the respective characters as supporting players more than anything.  Of the lot, the Dream story was the one I enjoyed the most, as it provided some interesting back-story (why Dream was morose in the \\"Sandman\\"; why he and Desire were always at each other's throats), while reminding the reader that despite the Vertigo trappings of the series, it was still conceived in the DC Universe proper.  The Death story was also a treat, as Death waits for an island trapped in eternity.  And the Desire story was really more of an adventure story, harkening to Tolkien or Howard (with excellent art by Milo Manera, reknowned for his ADULT work).    <br /> <br />The Despair and the Delirium stories were experimental, tailored to more abstract artists.  Good, if confusing.  The Despair story was really a series of anecdotes about miserable persons.  The Delirium story actually had a beginning, middle, and end, but it was a difficult read.   <br /> <br />The Destruction story was interesting, set in a period after the \\"Sandman\\" series ended, but I wasn't sure where Gaiman was going with it.  In the end, I suspect Gaiman didn't know either.    <br /> <br />The Destiny story, while beautifully illustrated by Frank Quitely, was really a \\"biography\\" of Destiny.   <br /> <br />It's worth reading, no doubt, but don't even bother unless you are versed in Gaiman's Endless.   <br /> <br />Here's hoping Gaiman fills in some of the other gaps in Dream's story.	2005-03-14

And I did read that series for a little while, but right when the whole company was on the down-turn.  But, I was excited to learn that the original \\"Doctor Solar\\" series from Gold Key was being reprinted by Dark Horse.    First, it's worth pointing out that the original Doctor Solar and his Valiant counter-part are very different.  Magnus was simply picked up where the Gold Key series left off (although there was a different slant on the nature of \\"evil\\" robots).  Solar, however, was rebooted completely.  Indeed, the original Doctor Solar was treated as a comic book (a la the Flash).  His Valiant counter-part was a fan, who received his powers in a similar accident, and then went somewhat crazy.  The origin was pretty confusing.    Returning to the book in question.  I enjoyed it, but not quite as much as the \\"Magnus\\" hardcover.  While Bob Fukjitani and Frank Bolle were both excellent artists, they never quite got to the heights of Russ Manning.  Another problem is that the character never quite seem as strongly developed as Magnus was.      Doctor Phillip Solar (his first name is never used in this volume)is involved in a nuclear accident, his whole body is rebuilt at an atomic level, making him a \\"man of the atom\\", allowing him great power.  He then spends the next several issues, handling various menaces while trying to keep his new powers under wraps (literally, as long term exposure to him would be fatal).  The central villain is the mysterious Nuro, whose face is never seen.  This is one of the strengths of this volume:  Nuro deduces Solar's existence only about issue four, whereas Solar doesn't even consider that there is a maestro of the events in the series until issue seven.  It makes for an interesting relationship.    Solar was in many ways different from other out-and-out super-heroes of the time.  For example, Solar doesn't get his famous red costume until issue five.  The only reason he does is because he begins to get the vague inkling that he is being targeted, and so he needs a means to distract Nuro.  Up to that point, he simply solved problems covertly.    However, there are some obvious similarities to the comic book characters of the time.  Most of the characters of the Marvel Universe got their super-powers as a result of radioactive events.  Indeed, there are some interesting similarities to Marvel's own Hulk.  Both characters get their powers after the actions of sabateurs, and whenever Solar goes into action, his skin turns green.      \\"Doctor Solar\\" is fun, if not the best the Silver Age of comics has to offer.  I am looking forward to further volumes in this series.	2005-02-27
US	49102989	R2D8N7N78WX0EZ	0380726297	516722500	Sacred	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Excellent writing, excellent characters, excellent novel	After the fairly brutal read that was \\"Darkness, Take My Hand\\", I decided to take a step back from the Kenzie/Gennaro series.  I hadn't meant to do that for nearly a year, but I decided now was a good time to grab the next in the series.      In \\"Sacred\\", Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro, after a period spent recovering from the events of \\"Darkness\\", find themselves dragooned into helping a dying entrepreneur find his daughter.  Initially leery, Kenzie and Gennaro discover different reasons to pursue the case.  Gennaro finds a kindred spirit in emotional loss.  Kenzie learns that his mentor in the private eye business was first employed, and has himself disappeared.  Naturally, nothing is ever easy, as Kenzie and Gennaro learn pursue the girl's trail to a self-help group backed by a religious sect, and then down to Florida, in the process finding sadists, monsters, and assorted other evils.    If there is any central theme to this series, it is the nature of power.  Characters seek power for its own sake, doing awful things to gain it, and then gratutiously inflicting even greater pain once they wield it.  And so it falls to Kenzie and Gennaro to somehow find some justice, although it often means briefly stooping to the level of their adversaries to achieve it.  It's pretty gratifying for the reader, nonetheless, to have at least two characters who maintain some morality in this immoral world Lehane has constructed.      My only real complaint with \\"Sacred\\" is that it came after \\"Darkness, Take My Hand\\".  The earlier book was a true novel of horror, featuring some of the most truly evil antagonists in fiction.  \\"Sacred\\", while featuring some really nasty villains, manages to stay pretty light.  This is a somewhat mixed-blessing.  On the one hand, I'd have no problem rushing out and getting the next book.  On the other, I'm not sure how much of an impression this book will leave in my mind, particularly when compared with the rest of the series.      Lehane has legitimate talent, and knows how to write flesh and blood people.  \\"Sacred\\" is a perfectly good example of that.  It is an excellent novel with excellent writing and excellent characters.	2005-02-27

While volume six is a little over two years old, there are other characters in the DC Archives who have been noticeably fast-tracked (\\"All-Star\\", \\"Justice League of America\\", and \\"Legion of Super-heroes\\").  Yet, DC seems to be spreading Superman out a bit over the course of four separate archive series.  Consequently, each sub-series advances one volume every couple of years, although there's a new Superman archive out at least once a year.      Volume six comprises issues published in 1943.  As expected, there's plenty of war propaganda, as Superman tangles with his fair share of Axis saboteurs and fifth columnists.  However, the New Dealer Superman was already being slowly replaced by the more familiar Sci-Fi hero that most people are familiar with.  Here Superman tangles with the Prankster, one of Superman's not-so super-villains.  In a slightly hair-raising story, the Prankster copyrights the alphabet (I took copyright in law school, so my eyes stayed crossed the whole story).  Superman also battles evil gnome creatures working at the behest of Hitler, as well as the incredible inventions of a mute genius.  Of course, Superman also tangles with his share of gangsters, helping out a normally lucky do-gooder when his luck goes south, as well as solving the mystery of four criminals who are locked in a death-pact.       This volume features some fairly experimental material compared with previous volumes.  The idea that perhaps Clark and Lois are more suited to each other than Lois and Superman is explored in \\"Surprise for Superman\\".  Further, the concept of what would become the \\"Imaginary\\" or \\"Elseworlds\\" story is present in a formative stage.  After Clark and Lois visit a stage production of a melodrama, Clark imagines a Superman story in the melodrama milieu.    Like all comic book stories from the golden age, you have to take this volume as you find it.  The art work is pretty solid, if a little cartoony (featuring some nice work by Jack Burnley among others).  Also the stories are mostly clever, entertaining, plot-driven affairs, mostly written by Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel.       Lots of fun, especially for it's nostalgia value.  Just wish they'd move a little faster in completing this Archives series, as they have with \\"All-Star\\" and \\"Legion\\".	2005-02-20

Patrol: Total War\\", a Gold Key series from 1965.  It was work that genius Wally Wood did in between redesigning Daredevil at Marvel and creating \\"T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents\\" for Tower.  As such, it can be seen as a precursor to that more famous work.      The basic plot is very simple.  Invaders of unknown origin appear and attack nearly every country.  While we learn that several places on Earth are attacked (including Moscow), most of the action takes place on the eastern sea-board of the U.S.  The invaders are swift and brutal, murdering everyone in their path, with the only goal appearing to be conquest.  It's up to the M.A.R.S. (Marine Attack Rescue Service) Patrol, an elite team of specialists, to stem the tide of invaders and win the day.  Each member has their own specialty that come to bear as the plot requires.  Cy Adams is the leader, and quite the pilot.  Russ Stacey is one of the best weapon designers in the country.  Joe Stryker, along with having the coolest name, is a demolitions expert.  Ken Hiro is a frogman, as well has a skilled martial artist.  Interestingly, the team is ethnically diverse.  Stryker is African-American.  Hiro is Japanese-American.  While Hiro often cracks wise by playing on people's expectations of Asian stereotypes, not a whole lot is made of the teams diversity.      This volume collects the first three issues of the series.  The fact that there were only ten issues altogether probably explains why this series was archived in trade paperback rather than in hardcover like \\"Magnus, Robot Fighter\\".  But the three issues are pretty lengthy, and each feature all manner of whiz-bang action as M.A.R.S. Patrol fends off the invaders' attacks on New York City, Niagra Falls, and other attempts to take America.      One thing that surprised me was just how violent this series is.  While both DC and Marvel had a certain amount of mayhem in their respective super-hero lines, most peopletend not to think of Silver Age comics as violent.  But in this series, right from the get-go, we know that the invaders are playing for keeps as they mow down soldier and civilian alike, giving no quarter, and asking for none.  In this regard, \\"M.A.R.S. Patrol: Total War\\" would easily fit into today's market, in an era where we are constantly aware of the threat of stateless ideologues who want to kill us.      While its not clear if Wood created this series, there are certain elements which suggest Wood might have been playing around with a \\"T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents\\" prototype. The acronym team-name, the team full of experts, and the mysterious invaders, all found their way into the later, better known series.  It's a shame that this series doesn't get as much recognition as Wood's other work.      Again, like \\"Magnus\\", I was left to wonder if maybe Dark Horse could have spent some money on reproduction.  Again, Gold Key's coloring process wasn't too spectacular, and Dark Horse must have made the best of it.  Still, the quality does nothing to distract from the content of great Wood art and entertaining stories.  I eagerly await the remainder of series.	2005-01-31
US	49102989	R3GEJQ8HEWB0IU	0895264102	680964179	Coolidge: An American Enigma	Books	4	16	17	N	N	Fair assessment of an elusive man	I purchased the late Robert Sobel's \\"Coolidge: An American Enigma\\" by happenstance.  I had no particular opinion of Calvin Coolidge, beyond the general impression that he was one of the very few \\"caretaker\\" presidents of the 20th century.  After completing this biography, that impression remains unchanged.  Despite Sobel's infectious enthusiasm for his subject, Coolidge remains a cipher: likable, decent, honest, but very deliberately lacking in color or discernable personality.    Sobel knows how to write an entertaining biography, especially in light of how dry his subject is.  He skillfully follows Coolidge from his childhood in Vermont, his education at Amherst, his governance of Massachusetts, and finally his rise to the office of first vice-president, then president.  Through this, Sobel paints interesting portraits of the man and his times.  Indeed, some of the most exciting parts of the book occur when Sobel shifts his focus away from Coolidge and focuses on the events that affect the outcome of Coolidge's life.  While some of the examination of the Massachusetts political machine seem a little tangential, the passages recounting the Boston police strike and the 1920 Republican convention are particularly gripping.  His overview of the scandals of the Harding administration are paticularly instructive.      Still, Sobel never loses sight of the fact he's writing a book about Coolidge.  His examination of Coolidge as president is intriguing, if a little sparse.  Sparse, because Coolidge himself is difficult to pin down.  He was very much from the laissez-faire school of government, taking great pains to limit federal intervention in state and local matters, as well as business.  The downside of this was, as Sobel does note, Coolidge did very little beyond pay lip-service to social issues of the country, e.g., the plight of African-Americans and Native Americans.  He was also not terribly interested in international matters, although as Sobel points out, Coolidge was able to handle tensions with Mexico.  He is also very explicit that the tendency to lay the Depression at Coolidge's feet is totally unfair, as Coolidge was only in the vaguest awareness of what could happen to the booming economy, and was far less equipped to do anything about it.      The most substantial problem I had with this book is Sobel's tendency to allow too much of his own bias show.  Sobel, from what I can tell, was very much a Reagan Republican.  This was obviously a reason for his decision to attempt to rehabilitate Coolidge.  However, that often leads to awkward editorializing.  The most overt example is a lengthy dissection of previous Coolidge historiography, including an an attempt to reutt the works of Arthur M. Schlesinger on the failure of the Harding-Coolidge-Hoover era.  While I realize that Sobel's intent was to take on the popular view of Coolidge as some sort of failure, I felt that Sobel's decision to place this argument in the beginning of Chapter 9 inappropriate.  This would have made perfect sense in the introduction or the epilogue materials.  Including it in the body was distracting, and caused me to set it down for a little while.        Another concern was Sobel's copious use of block excerpts, particularly in the opening of the book.  It felt like Sobel was padding a little.  As the work progresses, the quotes seem more useful, and less intrusive.      On the whole, I surprised by \\"Coolidge: An American Enigma\\".  I found Coolidge the man appealing.  While he would have been horribly out of step with this day and age (indeed, just years later he would have been quaint), Coolidge was a man of his time, lending further credence to the idea that times make men as much as men make times.  Had Sobel distanced himself a little more from his subject, it would have been about perfect.  As it stands, it's an excellent single volume about a caretaker president.	2005-01-30
US	49102989	R3GJOL7GS3BJPD	1563895072	380409856	Golden Age, The: Green Lantern - Archives, Volume 1 (Archive Editions (Graphic Novels))	Books	4	15	17	N	N	Classic Reprints of a Comic-book Stalwart	When I first started reading comic books, my only exposure to super-heros up to that point had been through other media, specifically the cartoon \\"The Super Friends\\".  Imagine my surprise to learn that there was more than ONE of nearly every Super Friend in the comic books.  Adding to my confusion was the fact that these counterparts lived on a parallel Earth, and that some, like Superman and Batman, were identical to the heroes I knew, but that others, like Flash and Green Lantern, were entirely different from the characters I watched Saturday mornings.      It didn't take me long to figure out what was going on: the heroes of the forties, the more famous revisions in the late 50s and early 60s, and the fact that after 1985, SOME of that didn't matter anymore.  The Superman and Batman of Earth 2 were gone, but the GL and Flash remained along side their more famous Silver Age counterparts.  And, for the most part, they retain a strong measure of popularity in their own right, co-starring in DC's monthly \\"JSA\\", as well as playing supporting roles throughout the comic book line.  AND, for the most part, their golden age adventures were still part of continuity.      So it was with great eagerness that I picked up and read \\"The Golden Age Green Lantern Archives\\".  And I must say I am pleased.  Now, there are some basic caveats that go along with reading comics from the golden age.  Character development is minimal; plot rules all.  Art is mostly simple and cartoony.  Narration is always needlessly elaborate (don't say in one word when you can say it in seven).  Continuity is negligible.  Taken in that spirit, the Golden Age Green Lantern is a treat.    For those not familiar, Green Lantern is really Alan Scott, the lone survivor of a train wreck, saved by a magical lantern.  This lantern originally came to earth as a meteorite, which was molded by a Chinese lamp-maker into a lamp.  It made its way across the centuries, before landing in Scott's lap, bringing first death (by killing the superstitious peasants who murdered the lamp-maker), life (restoring sanity to an asylum inmate), and finally, to Alan, power, in the form of a ring which responds to Alan's will, allowing him to do anything he can imagine.  It's only weakness is wood.  In this way, Green Lantern is unique among golden age heroes, as he actually has a well-thought out origin.      The team of Bill Finger on writing and Marty Nodell on art is, for the most part, a winner.  Finger, co-creator of Batman, knew how to tell a story (he was also guilty of overwriting narration).  Nodell's art started particularly cartoony, often looking rushed, and out of proportion, and even awful.  As the volume (and the months) progress, however, Nodell's artwork improved noticeably, becoming cleaner with some nice instances of detailed line work.  Not often, but it is a noticeable improvement.           One of the problems I had with \\"The Golden Age Starman\\" was the science fiction hero being saddled with mundane crooks and thugs as villains.  Green Lantern has this problem to a minor extent, but it doesn't seem quite as bad.  Alan was created from the start as a \\"people's champion\\" so to speak.  He starts out as an engineer.  A gangster is responsible for the train wreck that indirectly gives Alan his powers.  Later, Alan joins a radio station, and, rather like Clark Kent, is privy to corrupt politicians, power brokers, loan sharks, and the like.  It seems far more intrinsic to the character to battle mundane crooks than it does with Starman.    Alan did have some unique qualities.  While Alan was in competition with himself for the affections the lovely Irene, Alan himself was no sop, often tangling with crooks in his civilian identity.  Further, like other heroes, he gained a sidekick, but NOT a teenage Robin.  Rather, his partner was tough middle-aged cab driver, Doiby (derby) Dickles, who often charged in swinging to a fray while mangling the English language.      Alan continuesto be a prominent force in the DC Universe.  I'm looking forward to future volumes in this series, particularly the stories that introduced real super-villains.  As a continuing stalwart, he deserves it.	2005-01-22

Probably his least self-conscious in terms of conveying a meaningful message.  Indeed, aside from some quick jabs of satire regarding class and the customary warning against bad science found in all \\"mad scientist\\" stories, Wells seems far more interested in having fun with the idea of an invisible man.  The end result is just a treat.<br /><br />In a nutshell, a mysterious man, wrapped in bandages, arrives in a small English hamlet, takes a room in bording house, and demands absolute privacy, as he fiddles with chemistry sets and generally acts like a mad man.  When he finally has enough of his neighbors' nosyness, this man, Griffin, rips off his bandages and false facial features, revealing himself in all of his invisible glory.  He then creates all manner of mischief, even committing a murder.  Looking up an old acquaintance, Kemp, Griffin relates his grand scheme for a \\"reign of terror\\", leading to the rule of the Invisible Man over the world.<br /><br />Despite Griffin's progressively evil nature, Wells was definitely going for laughs.  Griffin is far more successful in being a general pain then he is a monster.  Nonetheless, when he begins on his plans, they are unnerving.  When he turns on Kemp, the reader genuinely fears for Kemp's safety.  And yet when he meets his demise, we find ourselves rather pitying the poor fool.<br /><br />This novel was only directly filmed once, starring Claude Rains.  While it alters the plot some, the film definitely captures the spirit of Wells' classic.<br /><br />While not Well's most sophisticated novel, it is among his most entertaining.  You can't go wrong with this one.	2005-01-11

I came to be fan of his work rather recently (4 years ago or so), specifically because DC Comics had begun archiving his most famous creation, the Spirit.      I'm not sure if Eisner was at his pinnacle here, simply because once Eisner came back to the series after WW II, the quality of the series continued to go up.  Each volume has been better than the last.  I suppose when the series is completely archived, I'll know for sure.  As it stands, what is collected in the volume is just great.      Eisner was obviously continuing to play around with the medium proper, as well as the weekly seven-page format.  In this volume, Eisner creates six stories comprising an extended continuing arc.  Three stories are dedicated to the Spirit's \\"final\\" battle with the arch-nemesis, the Octopus.  A master criminal, the Octopus's face was never seen (save for one brief glimpse of his eyes), only his gloved hands, which were more than capable of communicating his evil.  While the Spirit triumphs (although not completely, as the epilogue suggests), the battle leaves him blind.  Thus follows another three stories as the Spirit attempts to go about his crime-fighting without his sight.  The third story, \\"Into the Light\\", is one of the greatest Spirit stories ever, as Eisner allows an unusual amount of internal monologue from the Spirit, as he sinks deeper into despair.      While Eisner was in the Army, his various substitutes on the series allowed many of his most famous concepts and characters to go dormant.  When Eisner returned, he brought those ideas out in full force, as well as adding new ones.  He dusted off the year-end \\"Christmas Spirit\\" stories, brought back Spirit ally Satin, and pulled back the focus off of pure crime stories.  He also added new femme fatale P'Gell (see volume 13), a basically amoral female foil for the Spirit who played an interesting ongoing role in the Spirit's adventures, including uneasy ally.  In this volume, Eisner introduced another supporting character, Patrolman Sam Klink, who at first seeks to show-up the Spirit in the crime-fighting biz, but eventually becomes his staunchest ally.      Conceptually, Eisner also introduced \\"the Halloween Spirit\\" series, as well as \\"The Spirit's Favorite Fairy Tales for Juvenile Delinquents\\", little parodies of fairy tales that incorporate unsavory characters in familiar roles.  These are clever little stories, with nifty twists on old favorites, incorporating elements of hard-boiled fiction, nifty satire, and a dose of comedy reminiscent of the Warner Brothers \\"Merry Melody\\" cartoons.      Finally, Eisner was noticeably more satirical in this volume.  The most obvious one is \\"Li'l Adam\\" a parody of the comic strip biz, as someone tries to murder Al Slapp (read \\"Li'l Abner\\" creator Al Capp).  Was it one of his rivals (all dopplegangers for famous strip creators)?  A second one, also quite funny, is \\"U.F.O\\", an alien invasion story written in response to the supposed landing at Roswell, N.M., as well as a being a jab at the hubris of celebrity, personified by Awsome Bells, a clever parody of Orson Welles.  Eisner could be satirical, but never quite so bitingly.    We've lost a national treasure, and I'm glad to see people are recognizing it.  Do yourself a favor and get this series, as well as his graphic novels.  All are worth it.	2005-01-07
US	49102989	RET5F1C4O0EQ2	1593072694	850783084	Magnus, Robot Fighter Archives Volume 1 (v. 1)	Books	5	19	19	N	N	Squeee!  Magnus is back!	As most people know, DC Comics has had their archive program (hardcover reprints of older comics) for over a decade now.  Not only has DC archived their big guns characters (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman), but they've also gotten their lesser characters (Sgt. Rock, Doom Patrol), the characters they've acquired (Blackhawk, Shazam) AND characters they've licenced for the simple purpose of archiving them (the Spirit, T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents).  Given this nice bit of diversity, I took it for granted that at some point, DC would also get around to archiving the characters published by Western/Gold Key.  Imagine my surprise when it was announced that Gold Key's work would be archived, NOT by DC, but by Dark Horse!   <br /> <br />Not that I'm complaining, of course.  It's great to see \\"Magnus: Robot Fighter, 4000 AD\\" and \\"Doctor Solar: Man of the Atom\\" in some format.  And Dark Horse isn't so unlikely.  This is a company that built itself on licenced properties (rather like Western), and has itself begun a variety of reprint programs.  So, they've entered the arena.  Good for them. <br /> <br />Like most readers my age, my first exposure to these characters, including Magnus, came in the early 1990s, when they were acquired and published by the now-defunct Valiant Comics.  I did get on board somewhat late, when the whole of the Valiant line was beginning its slouch towards despair, so to speak.  I did enjoy \\"Magnus\\" for a while.  However, my decision to read this Archive volume has more to do with my interest in Silver Age comics.  I am quite pleased that I did.   <br /> <br />For those coming in late, Magnus is a denizen of the year 4000 AD (or AD 4000, as is correct), a time where all of the citizens of the continent-size city North Am have become complacent and entirely too dependent on robots. Raised by the very first robot, Magnus was taught how to fight evil robots, his body honed until his strength could smash steel.  And for the seven issues contained in this volume, that's exactly what Magnus does, battling corrupt robots or corrupt humans who use robots for their own nefarious purposes.  At the same time, he forms a tight bond with Leeja Clane, daughter of a senator, herself sick of robot control.   <br /> <br />The big draw here of course is that great artwork by Russ Manning.  The line-work is absolutely clean, tight, and vibrant.  Further, the designs of the robots, the costumes of the humans, and the city itself, demonstrate the vibrancy and imagination Manning possessed.    <br /> <br />Manning wasn't a slouch in the writing department, either.  Each story exhibits an excellent grasp of pacing and drama, as well as ingenuity.  The villains are also legitimate threats.  H-8, the corrupt robot controller of the pol-robs (police robots), Mekman, the human who wants to be a robot, and Xyrkol, Magnus's most persistent foe, all present complex challenges that draw the reader in, as we watch and wonder how Magnus will inevitably beat them.  It's difficult to zero in on one favorite story.  All are excellent examples of why this series attained its classic stature. <br /> <br />However, due to thematic concerns, there is a certain of repetition in the stories.  Manning's central theme was wariness of technology.  Thus, Magnus often intones dire warnings about how lazy man has become, how dependent on robots man is, and how man should always be prepared for the day when the robots revolt.  The stories, naturally, follow these predictions, as Magnus battles malfunctioning robots, infected robots, and megalomaniacal robots.   It's fortunate that Manning new how to write an entertaining story, because the formula might have worn thin. <br /> <br />Someone else has griped about the quality of the reprint.  Granted, the colors are not as vibrant as they could have been.  However, I'm not sure if that's Dark Horse's fault.  Having looked through some of the original comics, I don't think Gold Key had great coloring process to begin with (compared with DC, and, much later, Marvel).  Granted, Dark Horse could have re-colored the series.  Still, that's really a minor quibble, and in no way impacted my enjoyment of the series.  If nothing else, the original covers, nearly all painted art, are included, and like most GK covers, are all gorgeous. <br /> <br />Dark Horse has planned only three volumes, encompassing Manning's work.  This seems limited, since this series did continue beyond Manning (not much, but still).  I'm also looking forward to the \\"Doctor Solar\\" hardcover, and the further volumes of \\"Magnus\\".  Terrific stuff.	2005-01-03
US	49102989	R35VOF7V5M6A2F	0141439475	655343360	Frankenstein	Books	5	219	243	N	N	A moving, disturbing, depressing, but also touching tale	Much like Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\", Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is a story we all think we know, but really don't.  Very few films have consciously attempted to follow the novel too closely (which shouldn't detract from the excellent James Whale/Boris Karloff film, or its masterpiece-sequel, \\"The Bride of Frankenstein).  Thus, everything popular culture \\"knows\\" about \\"Frankenstein\\" does not originate from literature, but from films.  This is a shame, in a way, because the novel itself is, if not the progenitor, an early vessel of so many archetypes found science fiction and horror.<br /><br />The basic plot remained intact when transferred to other media.  Swiss medical student Victor Frankenstein discovers the secret of life (which he never reveals, lest someone repeat the mistake).  He then puts together a body, essentially a man, from various corpses.  He then becomes horrified by the creature he has built, and abandons.  The creature, suffering a great deal of neglect and abuse, still manages to get a thorough education, and learns of his lineage.  After murdering Victor's younger brother, and framing the family maid, the creature tells his (admittedly) sad tale to his \\"father\\", and then demands a mate.  Victor, in a panic, agrees, then thinks better of it at the last moment, destroying the new bride.  In retaliation, the creature murders all of Victor's loved ones (including his wife), and leads Victor on a merry chase across the world.<br /><br />Most probably know that Mary Shelley wrote this book in response to a challenge issued by Lord Byron, during a vacation at Lake Geneva.  (Along with this story came John Polidori's \\"The Vampyre\\", the first English vampire novel.)  Most probably also know that Shelley went on to write other works of imaginative gothic fiction.  Still, her modern reputation rests with this book.<br /><br />As stated, numerous archetypes (themes, plot lines, characters) are present here.  The basic fear of what evil technology may bring along with the good is a central theme, as is the warning against playing God.  So is the implicit admonition to be responsible in all things, be it during innovation or being a parent.  The creature is, for all intents and purposes, an android-everyone from Gort to C-3PO owe their existence to the Frankenstein monster.  And the monster that slays all but one protagonist is a staple of horror, be it traditional monster movies, like \\"Alien\\", or more realistic slasher movies like \\"Halloween\\".<br /><br />But, as I noted at the beginning of this review, certain of these elements have been lost in most interpretations.  The creature is actually intelligent, and well-spoken, quite different from the inarticulate grunts or slow, half-sentences of the movies. Further, while the films have made lightening a staple of the creatures creation, Shelley never really explains the process.  Finally, one of the staples of the films is the explanation for the creatures \\"evil\\" nature.  Often, the problem lies with the brain used, which almost invariably is a criminal brain, or is damaged before implantation.  In the book, the creature is really a child that's horribly neglected, but with the strength and intelligence to strike back: id without superego, and without restraints.<br /><br />Thus, \\"Frankenstein\\" will be a new experience for readers who know the source exclusively from the films.  Unlike \\"Dracula\\", there aren't any moments where a reader might look up and suddenly realize how quiet it is in the house, or how dark it's gotten outside.  In that regard, \\"Frankenstein\\" has not aged particularly well.  Throughout, however, it is a moving, disturbing, depressing, but also a touching and beautiful tale.  Those qualities have withstood the test of time.  While it is not always a rollicking adventure, it is a rewarding read.along with the good is a central theme, as is the warning against playing God.

It's a taut, smart, dramatic little thriller, full of the unlikely events Hitch really grooved on.  I was quite pleased at the end of this breezy novel, which is a pretty obvious source of LeCarre, Fleming, et al.  It's also a marvelous example of fiction incorporating the zeit geist of the era in which it was written. <br /> <br />Richard Hannay, late of South Africa, finds himself terribly bored in London, 1914 (which, having been to London, can't possibly imagine), until he meets the mysterious Franklin Scudder.  Allowing Scudder to live in his home, Hannay is astonished by Scudder's bizarre raving tale of an elaborate conspiracy to initiate war among the European powers.  Hannay takes this story with a bit of skeptisism until he comes home one night to find Scudder pinned to the floor by a knife.  Thus begins an elaborate and episodic chase, as Hannay, fully believing Scudder's claims, must run from the police and from the conspiracy, the Black Stone.   <br /> <br />Buchan is most successful in creating Hannay's elaborate schemes and escapes.  Hannay is a likeable hero, so the reader readily roots for him.  Further, the villains, while never fully developed (it is Hannay's story), make for sinister threats just off-page, so to speak.  The denouement is satisfying, if more than a little tragic.   <br /> <br />This book is also fascinating because the conspiracy, with changes in detail, basically mirrors the events that ignited World War I.  Various radical interests seek to assassinate a prominent figure (although Princip had no idea of the consequences of assassinating Franz Ferdinand), and trip the various political alliances to start a war.  Thus, Buchan incorporates the weird mixture of patriotism and panic that most historians point to when they chronicle the First World War.   <br /> <br />The downside of that zeit geist is that Buchan incorporates a certain level of anti-Semitism, some of it being of dubious necessity.  Scudder is convinced that Jews are responsible, because they want Russia to be destroyed by the war.  While we later learn that Scudder had prejudices against Jews, Scudder himself acknowledges the anti-Semitic history of Russia.  Another occasion, Hannay makes an analogy that plays on the stereotypes of Jews as being wealthy.  Again, that is probably an accurate reflection of the times, but it is uncomfortable.  To Buchan's credit, the conspiracy is more than simply an \\"evil Jewish plot\\" (it's telling that some of the rhetoric Buchan uses is still floating around today). <br /> <br />Nonetheless, as with most older literature, you have to take the prejudices in context of when the book was written.  \\"The Thirty-Nine Steps\\" is not an heir to the \\"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\".  It is an exciting thriller, featuring a heavy does of suspense and intrigue.  Simply put, it's a blast.	2004-12-25
US	49102989	RYWU7MTB4CU6Z	1401201555	919442083	Golden Age, The: Sandman - Archives, Volume 1 (Archive Editions (Graphic Novels))	Books	5	49	52	N	N	Suprisingly unique Golden Age stories.	In the 1990s, one of the comics that routinely found its way to the top of my reading pile was \\"Sandman Mystery Theatre\\", published by DC Comics under its mature-readers \\"Vertigo\\" imprint.  In this series, writer Matt Wagner (later joined by Steven T. Seagle) and artist (most of the time) Guy Davis took one of the lower tier golden age super-heroes, Wesley Dodds, the Sandman, and re-wrote his adventures, still set in the late 1930s, with a more mature, adult audience in mind (it was also an obvious attempt to spin-off Neil Gaiman's popular \\"Sandman\\" series, which did incorporate Wesley Dodds as a background element).     When the series was cancelled, I was honestly crushed.  So, imagine my pleasure when I learned that DC was finally beginning to reprint the series in trade paperback form.  Imagine my additional delight to learn that, as part of a tie in, DC was releasing an archive edition of the Sandman's golden age stories.      I am happy to say that the material found in \\"The Golden Age Sandman Archives\\" is much better than your average golden age fare.  Now, there's no denying the importance of the Golden Age.  But, it was not a time of huge sophistication in the medium.  Stories were short, simple, and plot driven.  The characters, including the lead, were usually mostly stock characters, with certain quirks to distinguish them from other characters.  The Sandman did have certain stock traits, but there were some fairly critical distinctions from other Golden Age mystery men.    In brief, for reasons not made clear, Wesley Dodds, rich playboy (like some many others) decides to combat crime.  While he has no superpowers, he is in great physical condition with a keen intellect.  Thus, he dons a gas-mask and makes use of a gun that fires sleeping gas (hence his name), and leaves sand at the scene of his captures.      But that's where the \\"standard\\" qualities end.  \\"The Sandman\\" was actually quite unique for a few reasons.  First, Dodds outside his costume was no slouch.  Unlike many of his contemporaries, Wes Dodds didn't put up a facade of the spoiled rich boy who flinches at the first sign of danger.  Indeed, in one story, Dodds, conveniently carrying a gun when a restaurant is robbed, takes a few shots at the crooks.      Second, more mundanely, the Sandman's costume was his gas-mask, his cape, his fedora, and . . . a green business suit.  Yep, it wasn't until Joe Simon (co-creator of \\"Captain America\\", among others) and Jack Kirby (also co-creator of Cap, as well as about half the Marvel Universe) came onboard that the Sandman took a more traditional super-hero flavor.      Finally, \\"The Sandman\\" series was unique for its female lead, Dian Belmont, Wes Dodds girlfriend, daughter of the DA, and the Sandman's able sidekick.  Unlike so many other female leads, Dian was not simply killing time with the hero's civilian identity until he could put on his mask and save her.  Dian was a vital part of the Sandman's life and career.  While Wes did have to save Dian on occasion, Dian also saved Wes a few times.  These differences make the series unique among most of the other golden age stories DC produced.      In terms of the quality of the stories, \\"The Sandman\\" can be hit or miss, though with noticeably more hits.  Given his obviously pulp-inspired nature, the Sandman spent most of his time duking it out with thugs and racketeers, although his early adventures did find him in more \\"high adventure\\" style stories, a la Doc Savage, with Dodds using his flying prowess to battle air-pirates with a vendetta in \\"The Three Sandmen\\", and battling a group of hostile natives in \\"Island Uprising\\".  When the prolific Gardner Fox came aboard, the stories became far more crime oriented, with Sandman and Dian battling jewel thieves and loan sharks.      It's worth noting how much Wagner and company kept from the original strips in \\"Mystery Theatre\\".  Early in the volume, Wes slips out in costume, leaving a doll to sleep in his bed.  While this gimmick was only used once in the golden age, it was a trademark of Wagner's series.  Likewise, at least two villains, the Tarantula and the Face, did make appearances here, although it appears they were one time villains.  In the 90s, the first two story arcs took their name from each respective villain.  Naturally, the plots were wildly different, as Wagner made full use of his mature-readers stamp to make both characters super-brutal monsters.  It's also worth noting that the dashing Dodds of past was replaced with a more pudgy, booking, but far more driven one in SMT.    This volume has quickly risen high on my list of favorite golden age archive editions.  There's just so much about it that's unique and refreshing.  Plus, those little references that were used in the 90s made me smile.  Definitely a keeper.	2004-12-25
US	49102989	R1DJ66P2Y8VO3V	0451523377	821153252	Dracula (Signet Classics)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	So you think you know this book?	Ah, \\"Dracula\\".  Is there a single book in the English language the more people know better?  Well, actually, yes, because the truth of the matter is people who think they KNOW everything there is to know about the story probably have never read the book cover to cover.  I realized this about half way in.  So much our culture \\"knows\\" about vampires and Dracula having nothing to with the text of the book, but originate from Hollywood.<br /><br />There's not a whole lot of reason to go into the plot too heavily.  The basics have been done more or less in the movies: English real estate agent goes to Transylvania to sell a house in England to a mysterious count, Dracula.  Dracula is a vampire, intent on finding new blood abroad.  What follows is a mostly terrifying (but occasionally slow and dull) battle between good and evil, modernity and superstition, and faith vs. magic.<br /><br />However, \\"Dracula\\" is nowhere near a perfect novel.  Bram Stoker, much like his contemporaries, tended to overwrite.  In some instances, this approach works, particularly in Jonathan Harker's experiences in Castle Dracula.  Here, Stoker is able to convey to the reader (even those familiar with the story from the films) Harker's genuine confusion and horror as Dracula's behavior quickly shifts between cordial and terrifyingly violent.  The encounter over the mirror which doesn't reflect Dracula's reflection, Harker's near attack by the count's bride (and the surprising erotic overtones), the feeding on infants, and Harker's discovery of Dracula in his coffin, blood on his lips, as he lays \\"like some filthy leech\\" are vividly drawn and thoroughly frightening.<br /><br />Other excellent moments include the log of the ship Dracula arrives on (pasted, inexplicably into Mina Harker's journal).  The desperation of the captain as his crew is picked off by some monster is truly haunting.<br /><br />Also memorable is the character of Renfield, the lunatic who somehow Dracula reaches out to.  His need to eat his way up the food chain is darkly humourous and grotesque.<br /><br />Sadly, not everything about the novel is this well done.  Abraham Van Helsing is a Dutch character.  Stoker wildly overwrote his speech patterns and accent.  Consequently, he often seems to be more comedy relief than the wise leader of the band of hunters (definitely an improvement in the films).  Likewise, Quincey Morris, a Texan, often flirts with stereotype, but Stoker is able to keep the character serious, if not terribly well developed (which is probably why Quincey has only appeared in one or two films, despite his pivotal role in Dracula's demise).  The various group meetings to discuss a plan of action and exchange knowledge often take on the quality of a superficial prayer meeting.<br /><br />What amazed me was how much we take for granted about the Dracula-myth was NOT borne out by the novel.  Dracula seems comfortable wandering out in the daylight without bursting into flame.<br /><br />Still, on the whole Stoker succeeds.  The novel is a rewarding one, and, despite its age, actually offers some genuine chills.  If it's not perfect (which it's not), it virtues greatly outshine its flaws.	2004-12-19
US	49102989	RPB5YJJSMTC5C	0812505042	691093854	The Time Machine	Books	5	2	2	N	N	One of the greatest novels in the English language	H.G. Wells' \\"The Time Machine\\" is one of the most respected pieces of Victorian science fiction, and deservedly so.  It is at once a great novel of adventure and imagination, a social tract predicting class warfare, and a touching story of humanity and the connections humans make in desperate times.<br /><br />Everyone knows the plot.  The man simply called the \\"Time Traveler\\" relates to the unnamed narrator his adventures in the year A.D. 802,712, and the two species of small humanoids who reside there: the Eloi and the Morlocks.<br /><br />The Eloi live an idyllic existence of leisure.  Their intelligence is limited, they aren't particularly strong, nor altruistic, as the Traveler learns when one of the Eloi, Weena, is on the verge of drowning.  Appalled at the apparent indifference, the Traveler rescues her, and makes a close friend.<br /><br />The Morlocks live below ground.  Evidently, they keep the engines that run this future moving.  They also tend to the Eloi, providing them with the basics.  But it soon becomes clear that the Morlocks are the true masters, for the Eloi fear the dark, fear the openings to the Morlocks' domain.  For the Morlocks feed on the Eloi.  And, as the Traveler soon discovers, the Morlocks have stolen his time machine.<br /><br />To appreciate exactly what Wells was trying to do with this future society, it helps to know that Wells was a socialist, and believed that the upper classes take their soft existence from the toil of the lower classes.  The end result is the Eloi.  Wells is clearly issuing a combination  warning/manifesto-eat the rich; their laziness will be their downfall.  However, Wells acknowledges that class war is a double-edged sword.  The Morlocks are the lower class in a state of revolt.  But they are a degraded, filthy lot who are content to continue their miserable existence for brief moments of revenge.  And so, for both species, the benefits of their arrangement are outweighed by the price.<br /><br />Those who have seen the George Pal film will probably be surprised by this dynamic, as in the film (made in the 1950s, the Cold War in full swing), the relationship overtly remains, but the underlying cause has more to do with the events of a third world war, and Pavlovian reflex to basically duck and cover.<br /><br />But, \\"The Time Machine\\" is still also a straightforward adventure novel, abundant with excitement and action.  Particularly exciting are the Traveler and Weena's desperate escapes from the Morlocks in the night.  Indeed, the Morlocks represent some of the most threatening creatures in literature.  Well's descriptions of the Traveler's wanderings in the Morlock's underground are among the creepiest moments I have ever read, as the Traveler is watched by red eyes and the dark, is mocked by hisses and laughter from unseen mouths, and is touched and prodded by furry, spider-like hands.<br /><br />Wells also creates some very tender moments between the Traveler and Weena.  Those who have seen the George Pal movie will not doubt expect a love story, which is not the case.  Really, the relationship between the two under Wells' pen is a complicated paternal one.  Weena adores the Traveler as her savior.  The Traveler clearly views Weena as a child.  The tenderness of this relationship is heightened by the very tragic end of Weena, and the Traveler's obvious grief over his loss.<br /><br />Of Wells \\"Holy Quartet\\" of novels (\\"The Time Machine\\", \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\", \\"The Invisible Man\\", \\"The War of the Worlds\\"), \\"The Time Machine\\" is probably the most successful.  While the others are obviously good, \\"The Time Machine\\", in my opinion, is the most effective at balancing Wells' desire to share his philosophy with his desire to entertain.  It's a short book, and can be read in an afternoon.  Certainly that is an afternoon well-spent.> <br />Those who have seen the George Pal film will probably be surprised by this dynamic, as in the film (made in the 1950s, the Cold War in full swing), the relationship overtly remains, but the underlying cause has more to do with the events of a third world war, and Pavlovian reflex to basically duck and cover.    <br /> <br />But, \\"The Time Machine\\" is still also a straightforward adventure novel, abundant with excitement and action.  Particularly exciting are the Traveler and Weena's desperate escapes from the Morlocks in the night.  Indeed, the Morlocks represent some of the most threatening creatures in literature.  Well's descriptions of the Traveler's wanderings in the Morlock's underground are among the creepiest moments I have ever read, as the Traveler is watched by red eyes and the dark, is mocked by hisses and laughter from unseen mouths, and is touched and prodded by furry, spider-like hands.   <br /> <br />Wells also creates some very tender moments between the Traveler and Weena.  Those who have seen the George Pal movie will not doubt expect a love story, which is not the case.  Really, the relationship between the two under Wells' pen is a complicated paternal one.  Weena adores the Traveler as her savior.  The Traveler clearly views Weena as a child.  The tenderness of this relationship is heightened by the very tragic end of Weena, and the Traveler's obvious grief over his loss.   <br /> <br />Of Wells \\"Holy Quartet\\" of novels (\\"The Time Machine\\", \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\", \\"The Invisible Man\\", \\"The War of the Worlds\\"), \\"The Time Machine\\" is probably the most successful.  While the others are obviously good, \\"The Time Machine\\", in my opinion, is the most effective at balancing Wells' desire to share his philosophy with his desire to entertain.

Having just finished Mark Bowden's \\"Killing Pablo\\", I find myself somewhat a jumble of emotions.  I think that my feelings most resemble those of DEA Agent Joe Toft, who wonders, when all is said and done, if killing Columbian drug lord Pablo Escobar was such a good thing.  After reading Bowden's gripping, wonderfully written piece, I must confess to seeing Toft's point. <br /> <br />Bowen follows briefly Escobar's life, his rise to power as drug lord of Medallin in the 1980s, and his eventual fall from grace and into his role as public enemy number one.  Through this, Bowden's tells us about the impact, both good an ill, Pablo had on Columbia, from murdering politicians and rivals, to building ballparks for his hometown.  Bowden never makes any over pronouncements of Escobar's evil.  He simply tells us what Pablo did, and lets those appalling actions speak for themselves.   <br /> <br />Bowden's examination of the internal politics of Columbia, first attempting to appease Pablo, then resolving to kill him, is also fascinating.  The injection of the United States is even more so.  In the perfect world, killing men like Pablo would be the common solution. <br /> <br />However, it's not a perfect world.  Bowden makes points of just how down and dirty the forces out to kill Pablo got, including making use of former associates and rival drug lords.  Further, the removal of Pablo did nothing to stem the flow of drugs into the US, and other drug lords filled the void. <br /> <br />\\"Killing Pablo\\" alternatively appalled, amused, and angered me.  Anyone wanting insight into the drug war, cover operations, and simply good recounting of history would enjoy this immensely.	2004-12-14
US	49102989	RHXSMTY3JL17L	1401202225	511165526	Fables Vol. 4: March of the Wooden Soldiers	Books	5	18	18	N	N	Best Story of the Series (So Far)	With four collected editions under their belts, writer Bill Willingham and artist Mark Buckingham (and others)have raised the stakes for their series, as Fabletown is finally directly attacked by their mysterious Adversary, who rules the homelands in Europe and Asia.   <br /> <br />Willingham has taken some pretty simple, almost cliche ideas, and has spun out one of the best comic books on the market right now.  It helps that Buckingham's art, while deceptively simple, is so richly detailed and distinctive, standing as a perfect vehicle for Willingham's quirky plots. <br /> <br />This book first reprints \\"The Last Castle\\", a one-shot that details the efforts of the last refugees in the Old World, as seen through the eyes of Little Boy Blue.  It's a tightly woven story, that offers little hope, and ends with even less, as the Adversary's overwhelming armies begin a siege and slaughter, while the last armies of the Fables fight to the last man to give the refugees time to escape.  In the middle of this is Blue's tragic relationship with Red Riding Hood. <br /> <br />Then, the story arc \\"March of the Wooden Soldiers\\" begins in earnest, as, under mysterious circumstances, Red Riding Hood arrives in Fabletown.  While Mayor King Coal is anxious to give her asylum (in part to fend off Prince Charming's bid for the mayor's office), town Sheriff Bigby (Big Bad) Wolf is immediately suspicious of this new arrival (he met her, after all), and shares his concerns with Snow White, the deputy mayor and real leader of Fabletown.  Snow is, incidentally, pregnant with Bigby's child (or cub).  Little Boy Blue also shares Bigby's suspicisions.  Those suspicions seem validated when a sinister trio of men in black arrive on Red's heels, issuing demands against Fabletown for submission to the Adversary, and Fabletown must prepare for war.     <br /> <br />\\"March of the Wooden Soldiers\\" is a completely engaging war story, with a dash of politics, domestic comedy, and romance mixed in.  Snow and Bigby are among some of the best protagonists in the medium.  And Willingham's sense of pacing and ability to tell unpredictable stories is nearly incomparable.  Characters who seem indispensible die in the course of the battle (although, what is death for a Fable?), and the mystery of the Adversary looms large over the series (although Willingham drops some interesting hints in this story).  If you aren't reading \\"Fables\\" in any format, you should be. <br />	2004-11-19
US	49102989	RWCWK8RVLUCWD	1401201520	67855180	T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents - Archives, Volume 4	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Still Great After Four Volumes	While I'm not sure that \\"T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents\\" was running out of steam as the above review suggests, it certainly wasn't quite as snappy in 1966-7 as it was when it started.  Some of that might be due to the formula of several stories per 64-page issue, as well as attempts to spin the characters off into their own series.  This Archive volume reprints only one issue of \\"T.H.U.N.D.E.R.Agents\\" proper (#11).  It also includes the third and last issue of \\"Dynamo\\", and both issues of \\"Noman\\".  The prodigious amount of material combined with the small status of publisher Tower had to have taken its toll.<br /><br />Nonetheless, under genius Wally Wood's direction, even basically average material is pretty good, and there are a couple of truly standout stories contained in this volume.  The best, in my opinion, is the Noman story, \\"The Good Subterranean\\".  In this story, a Subterranean scientist, one of the last of the race whose attacks on the surface world lead to the formation of T.H.U.N.D.E.R., arrives at T.H.U.N.D.E.R. h.q., seeking asylum.  Noman's efforts to integrate former enemy into society are met with prejudice and hate.  Ultimately, the Subterranean gives his life in a heroic manner.<br /><br />What amazed me about this story is its relevance to 1966 as well as 2004.  Naturally, this is a story about prejudice at the time of the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S., while at the same time dealing with the aftermath of the Second World War and the Holocaust.  I also connected this story with our own post-9/11 world, in which we are fighting a war against terror, while trying to distinguish between \\"good\\" Muslims and \\"bad\\" ones.  The plea for education and understanding reverberates nicely.<br /><br />Another fun story is \\"Understudy for Dynamo\\".  As the title says, T.H.U.N.D.E.R. brass decide to create substitutes for their super-agents.  \\"Dynamite\\" Dan Atkins, a member of the THUNDER Squad for the role.  What follows, while cliched, is an example of pitch-perfect comedic timing, as Dan finds himself completely inept in his use of the Dynabelt, causing misery for himself and the rest of his team.  I actually laughed out loud a couple of times at this story.<br /><br />Whether they're fighting terrorist groups, mad scientists, unknown aliens, or super-powered communists, the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents is a fun ride, even today.  There are, by my count, two volumes left in this series, and I look forward to both of them.  Between DC Comics and Dark Horse Comics respective archive series, nostalgia fans have a lot of Silver Age material to read in affordable reprint editions.	2004-11-19
US	49102989	RES6BWNZHZWI3	1401201563	798561480	Superman: The Man of Tomorrow Archives, Vol. 1 (DC Archive Editions)	Books	5	37	38	N	N	Silver Age Superman goodness	Much like \\"Batman: The Dynamic Duo Archives\\", \\"Superman: The Man of Tomorrow Archives\\" represents a jump ahead from the Golden Age material found the \\"Superman Archives\\", \\"Superman: The Action Comics Archives\\", and \\"Superman in the World's Finest Archives\\".  And as with the \\"Dynamic Duo\\", there isn't any \\"official\\" reason for DC to have chosen to have done this, beyond a desire to get Silver Age material out there.  Plus, let's face it, Superman and Batman have been, and ever shall be, DC Comics Big Guns.  From the get go, both characters appeared in many differnt series, and multiple \\"Archives\\" sub-series is warranted (although why this leap is made NOW is anyone's guess).<br /><br />With the Silver Age of comics begun in 1956, and a whole variety of characters from the Golden Age being rewritten from scratch, it made sense to revisit the company's flagship character.  However, what DC with Superman was not a dramatic rewrite, a la, the Flash.  Starting in 1958, \\"Action Comics\\" and \\"Superman\\" saw the science fiction elements of the Superman mythos developed.  It also saw a renewed focus on the \\"Superman Family\\", as Jimmy Olsen, Lois Lane, and eventually, Supergirl, got their own solo series.  The New Deal Crusader Superman started out as was left behind, and the Galaxy Spanning Boyscout took his place.  Everything popular culture remembers Superman for (the city of Kandor and the other survivors of Krypton, the Fortress of Solitude, etc.) appeared at this time, as did a more diverse and challenging rogues gallery.<br /><br />We owe this creative shift to editor Mort Weisinger and his stable, most notably artists Wayne Boring (the definitive Superman artist for most the 1950s, and definitely one of my favorite Superman artists), Al Plastino, Kurt Schaffenberger, and Curt Swan, as well a writer Otto Binder, among others.<br /><br />As this is material from the Silver Age, a reader of modern comics has to take these stories as they find them (thank you, Dr. Wertham).  The focus on character development that is pretty much taken for granted in today's comics is absent.  The stories are more plot-driven.  This can be a mixed blessing.  When the stories are good, well-thought out and imaginative, then the story is a treat, and you smile with joy.  A good exmaple is the first story of the collection \\"The Super-key to Fort Superman\\", in which we see the Fortress of Solitude for the first time.  Despite its reputed impregnability, someone has snuck into the fortress, leaving notes for Superman that threaten impending doom.<br /><br />It was at this time the Superman villains got a much- needed boost.  While Superman always tangled with Lex Luthor, most of his enemies weren't any physical match.  This changed with the introduction of Brainiac (in \\"The Super-Duel in Space\\"), the evil android who travels the galaxy, shrinking cities for the purpose of building his own empire.  The most important of these cities is Kandor, a Kryptonian city taken just before the planet exploded.<br /><br />The stories weren't exclusively sci-fi.  In \\"The Steeplejack of Steel\\" Clark Kent goes undercover on a construction site to catch a fraudulent builder.  The crooks various attempts to knock-off this undercover snitch are amusing, and the story is a nice reminder that Superman is, by profession, a reporter, and does as much good in that job as when he's wearing a cape.<br /><br />The relationship with Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen are also well explored.  In \\"Mrs. Superman\\", due to a series of plot (amusing) contrivances, Clark and Lois are trapped together on an island.  Believing their situation to be hopeless, Clark comes clean, and proposes marriage.  Naturally, things change so they can escape, and the real conflict is how Clark fools Lois into thinking he's not Superman.  In the \\"Girl of Steel\\", Jimmy uses a magic artifact to grant Superman three wishes, one of which is a proto-type Supergirl.  While this character vanishes at the end of the story, shedid pave the way for Kara Zor-el, Superman's cousin.<br /><br />As I said, not every story is great.  The most glaring example is \\"The Return of Superman's Lost Parents\\" in which Clark's Earth-parents, the Kents (long dead) come forward in time to visit him.  Of course, that's not what's going on, but the big problem I had was swallowing the idea that Clark would accept this couple without suspicion.<br /><br />Aside from occasional clunker, the whole collection is a treat.  Of course, in 1985, DC did an elaborate restructuring of continuity, so none of these stories are canon.  This was a bit of a mixed-blesing.  Change can be good.  Lois Lane's perpetual schemes to marry Superman don't seem a particularly enlightened view of women.  On the other hand, change can be bad.  Brainiac was much more interesting before 1985 than he is now..<br /><br />There is an element of innocence in this book that's really quite enjoyable.  So while the Silver Age will always be hit and miss for me, the hits are far greater than the misses, and reading extremely fun.  I look forward to volume 2.  I do wonder if Wonder Woman (the third character of DC's \\"Holy Trinity\\") will be getting the Silver Age jump.  I also wonder if \\"DC Comics Presents\\", the more recent team-up book staring Superman, is considered \\"Archive\\" worthy.n's cousin.      As I said, not every story is great.

US	49102989	R1QP3SQBRVQ1VS	0743451759	560025750	Gone Fishin': Featuring an Original Easy Rawlins Short Story "Smoke" (Easy Rawlins Mysteries (Paperback))	Books	5	5	5	N	N	No mystery why Mosley is so good	I read some of Walter Mosley's \\"Easy Rawlins\\" mysteries a few years ago.  I recently decided to begin reading them again, starting with the prequel story \\"Gone Fishin'\\".      This was actually the first novel Mosley wrote about Ezekiel \\"Easy\\" Rawlins and his psychotic friend Raymond \\"Mouse\\" Alexander.  However, for whatever reasons, it never found a publisher.  However, \\"Devil in a Blue Dress\\" the second novel, was published.  I imagine that at least one reason \\"Devil\\" published is its more commercial status.  It's a mystery, set  in California in 1948.  In other words, it's a straightforward book to categorize, and thus, far more marketable.    \\"Gone Fishin'\\" is not a mystery, nor is it a real crime novel (although there is a fair amount of crime and mystery in the proceedings).  It is instead, a wonderfully grim coming of age story about two friends, both black, living in Texas before WW II.  Mouse is getting married, but has no money to finance a proper wedding.  Easy, Mouse's closest friend, and our \\"hero\\", agrees to drive Mouse to his hometown of Pariah, TX, with a vague plan to get the necessary funds from Mouse's hated stepfather.  Readers of other books in the \\"Easy Rawlins\\" series will know how that turns out.  But, as is the case with prequels, it's not the ending that really matters, it's the story that leads to that ending.    The most significant aspect of \\"Gone Fishin\\" is that it underlines the basic inconsequence of dividing fiction into genres and sub-genres.  Mosley tackles many of the same issues here that he tackles in his mysteries.  Easy is a man with feet of clay.  He's mostly likeable, but like all really great protagonists, he has numerous off-putting flaws.  I find myself alternating between rooting for him when he acts heroically and slapping myself in the head when he acts stupidly.  But he frequently grapples with matters of good and evil, the frailty of human nature, the cruelty that inhabits the world side by side with the kindness.  Inother words, Mosley's work is very \\"literary\\" or \\"serious\\"-except that there's a dead body, and Easy has to find whodunit, so they are merely \\"mystery\\" or \\"crime fiction\\" and so dismissed far too readily.  And it most certainly should not be that way.    \\"Gone Fishin\\" is Mosley at his best.  Easy's moral ambiguity begins in this novel.  Easy is perpetually trying to do the right thing, but finds himself helpless to thwart Mouse's machinations as he pursues money he believes that his stepfather owes him.  Easy also finds himself entangled in a peculiar relationship with a local \\"witch\\" Momma Jo, who lives in the swamp.  Mosley introduces other bizarre characters into this town of Pariah, and further creates an unhealthy atmosphere where the worst case scenario is inevitable.  While Easy offers some hope in the last pages for his future, readers who have read any of the other books will almost certainly feel how hollow that hope is.  More than anything, we see how Easy grows into the cynical man of the mystery novels, as, in his own words, he lost his \\"soul\\" far too early.  Arguably, the mysteries represent his attempts to regain it.     For people who have read Mosley, \\"Gone Fishin\\" will be a mixed blessing.  It's a great book, and is certainly a worthy part of the series.  But it may seem oddly out of place, or perhaps redundant, as the outcome has been discussed in the rest of the series.  On the other hand, the reader will finally watch Easy grow into the man they are familiar with.  For new readers, this is an excellent place to start, although those expecting a good mystery will be disappointed (implicitly, those who read this \\"literary\\" novel and proceed to the mere \\"mysteries\\" may also be disappointed).  But, those who are willing to set aside their expectations will be richly rewarded by this terrific novel.	2004-11-05
US	49102989	R2GI0ZQ3SQRTMK	1563896222	611811838	Golden Age, The: Starman - Archives, Volume 1 (Archive Editions)	Books	4	19	20	N	N	Mixed bag of writing; spectacular artwork	In the early 1990s, three comic books invariably found their way to the top of my pile: John Ostrander and Tom Mandrake's \\"Spectre,\\" Matt Wagner, Steven T. Seagle, and Guy Davis's \\"Sandman Mystery Theatre,\\" and James Robinson's \\"Starman.\\"  Knowledgeable readers will note that these three titles were all books that featured strong ties and characters from the \\"Golden Age\\" of DC Comics.      Years later, DC has released Archive Editions collecting the Golden Age adventures of each of these characters.  I read the Spectre a few years ago, just finished the Starman, and just purchased the Sandman.  I thought the Spectre was a lot of fun, and I am looking forward to reading the Sandman.  But I am here to review Starman.    Starman was pretty typical of \\"mystery men\\" at this time.  Ted Knight is a  rich playboy with aversion to work by day, who naturally is the tough as nails Starman by night.  He has a relationship with Agent Woodby Allen in his Starman guise.  As Ted Knight, he dates (sort of), Allen's niece Doris Lee.  Whenever Starman is needed, hypochondriac Ted fakes some illness and splits.  Naturally, Doris is more smitten with Starman than poor Ted.  Pretty standard stuff for the era.  And, many of these stories were written by go-to-guy, Gardner Fox.      And yet, there are some notable differences.  First, Starman's origin wasn't particularly well developed.  In one panel of expository dialog, we learn that Ted, evidently quite the scientist, developed the \\"gravity rod,\\" a small wand that collects energy from the stars, and allows the bearer to do, well, anything really.  Certainly not the elaborate origins of Superman, Flash, Green Lantern, et al.  Indeed, it was decades before the hows and whys of Starman were parsed in any meaningful way.   Second, unlike the charmingly (or not, depending on your tastes) cartoony artwork of most super-heroes at the time, Starman's artwork was strangely realistic, thanks to the stunning line work of artist Jack Burnley.    Inthe end, Starman was a mixed bag.  Gardner Fox did some solid scripts, but he was doing better at the time, and did much better in the sixties.  Part of Starman's problem is that, as a clearly sci-fi hero, he spent a good deal of time dealing with some fairly conventional menaces, mostly powerless gangsters, Axis saboteurs, and the like, rather than super-villains.  Thus, there was weird blend of sci-fi and crime fiction that only worked about half the time.  When there were more conventional sci-fi actioners, everything clicked.  A terrific example is a villain called the Unknown stealing a time machine, and bringing back future technology to commit his crimes.  That story works particularly well.  A second great example is the first Mist story, the villain who became Starman's arch nemesis (particularly delightful if you read Robinson's series in the 90s).  This story featured invisible criminals lead by the mad scientist, the Mist, a man whose body appeared to be a human head atop a gaseous cloud.  The story works, despite its crime setting, because it features a sci-fi hero versus a sci-fi villain.    That having been said, I couldn't help but role my eyes at some of the logic of the plots.  Fox handled sci-fi pretty well, but there were times I wondered if he'd read any science.  In one case, the gravity rod runs down because Starman has used all the power.  But because its daytime, he can't collect any more energy from the stars.  I'm pretty sure that the stars energy hits the earth constantly.  And anyway, the sun is a star itself.  I'm not sure why the rod would not collect energy on a constant basis. And there is the matter of Starman's mask NOT covering his face.  Doris couldn't recognize him as Ted Knight why?     Whatever may be said of the stories, Burnley's art is the real draw (pardon the pun).  His excellent line work, his attention to detail, his ability to communicate action and motion is all superb by any standard.  Regardless of any illogic in the plots, the artwork kept me going, and was always a joy to behold.    In the end, \\"The Golden Age Starman Archives\\" are a mixed bag.  It's not hard to see why the character never clicked the way Superman did.  Nonetheless, it's pretty solid; from the perspective of the art, it's outstanding.	2004-10-22

The easiest thing to do would be to say \\"It's awesome.  Go read it.  If you don't like it, you have no soul.\\"  That would be the quick way to discuss this book (and it would be accurate).      But, Andy Runton deserves a little more.  Because he's accomplished something to admire:  he's created a truly all ages comic book, that is, you can be past the age of 9 and really enjoy it.  That's not easy.  Quick, when was the last time you saw \\"good for all ages\\" on a book (or movie) and not feel your I.Q. drop a few points even before you even read page one(or watched the opening credits)?  And then you noticed it dropping as you progressed?    Runton doesn't do that.  His \\"Owly\\" stories engage you at a basic human level.  Owly is an owl, but he's the quintessential gentle soul, the rare altruistic good guy who looks out for the little guy and overcomes any obstacle to win.  You root for him because you know if there were more Owly's in the world, it would be a more bearable place to live in.      And the most amazing thing, aside from the wonderful art, is that Runton does this without a single word.  Aside from some expressive thought-balloons, Owly and his friends don't say anything.  But the drawings communicate a much raw emotion as a dozen well-chosen words could.      Enjoy \\"Owly\\" with your kids, by yourself, with friends and family.  It's time well spent, and good feelings well shared.	2004-10-19

Bobby Luczak, an American poet, his Indian-born wife Amrita, and their daughter Victoria, embark on a trip to the city of Calcutta.  Luczak has been contacted about doing a magazine article on the new work of a famous Indian poet, who has been missing for eight years.  What the family instead finds is a hidden cult that worships evil, and personal tragedy.    Simmons knows how to build a sinister mood.  From the early warnings of Luczak's friend Abe about going, to Luczak's first person observations of the city, Calcutta is a haunting, frightening, disturbing place.  Indeed, it is probably the best developed \\"character\\" of the novel, a place reminiscent of something out of \\"Blade Runner,\\" with its omnipresent shadows, grinding poverty, and general inhumanity swirling in a morass of evil.    Further, Simmons keeps the reader intrigued throughout, as Luczak encounters tightlipped professors and suspicious assistants, discovers a horrible secret about the poet, Das, and finally reads the horrifying epic poem,the titular \\"Song of Kali\\", that Das has uncharacteristically created after his 8-year absence.  Luczak's battle for survival, his panic, and his frenzy to escape with his family from Calcutta clung to me, compelling me to turn the page even when it was really time I should go to bed.  Simmons creates a generally unhealthy atmosphere throughout the book, and his simple, yet detailed prose paints a grotesque picture.    The problem with this book is its ending.  While too much detail would spoil it, suffice it to say, I kept looking at the top of the page thinking \\"He needs to give us the payoff here, not too many pages left.\\"  Unfortunately, the payoff isn't there.  While Simmons makes his point about human nature, there are a few too many loose-threads.  While it's not unheard of (indeed, it's really a cliche) to leave a certain ambiguity in novels of this type, Simmons leaves too much ambiguity.  Characters' motivations and actions are hinted at, but never confirmed.  Ultimately, upon reaching the last page, my only reaction was \\"That's it?\\"  This rather hurt the book overall.    Nonetheless, the majority of the book is still excellent, and ALMOST overcomes its abrupt ending.  But the ending hurts, and marred my enjoyment of a book that I suspect would have otherwise played on my mind for some time to come.	2004-10-14

But, other commitments (mainly law school) prevented me from sitting down and reading too many books, especially a 867-page tome.  But, now that I have a certain amount of free time on my hands, as well as a renewed interest in things historical, I finally got the chance to read it.  In a word: MASTERPIECE. <br /> <br />I'm not going to dissect the books factual accuracy or McPherson's thesis and conclusions.  That's for another time.  (Since the book won the Pulitzer, the odds are good that all of that was done right; the copious footnotes and bibliographical material lend credence to that.)   <br /> <br />The merits of the book are the issue, and they are many.  First, despite its considerable length, McPherson's writing is brisk, crisp, and engrossing.  The first chapter or so, which reviews the developments in the United States, north and south, leading up to the Civil War, specifically the impact of industrialization on the population of the country, can be a little slow.  However, when McPherson begins to examine the relationship between the north and the south, particularly the split on the slavery issue, the books really takes off, and I had great difficulty in putting it down. <br /> <br />McPherson's prose is very vivid.  His arguments for the inescapable import of slavery to the Civil War are abundant and persuasive.  But they are balanced arguments, acknowledging the ambiguities of the issue, as he differentiates pure abolitionists from those who feared slavery's impact on the free-labor, and acknowledges that not all abolitionists particularly wanted the freed slaves to remain in the United States.  He is also very honest about Lincoln's initial interest in preserving the Union, regardless of the slavery issue, and charts Lincoln's shift from this stance into an essentially abolitionist by necessity as the war progressed.  He also details the subsequent schism in the Confederacy wherein slavery became hindrance to independence, and debate about conscripting blacks into the army (critiques by other reviewers that McPherson discounted this are incorrect).   <br /> <br />McPherson is also pretty evenhanded in his discussion of the war itself.  He takes time to discuss the political, social, and economic impacts on both sides of the war, creating a full picture of this horrible conflict.  The names you know become a little more real: Lincoln, Davis, Grant, Lee, Sherman, Jackson are just that much more real to me.  While McPherson doesn't spend a huge amount of ink examining these men, he gives us vital facts about their lives, and is quite content to allow their actions speak for them.  His examination of those actions are frequently instructive. <br /> <br />While McPherson's main interest is the politics of the war, he is no slouch when it comes to examining the battlefield.  Even in the dispassionate recounting that McPherson the historian provides does little to alleviate the horror of the war.  McPherson paints a brutal picture of a country tearing itself apart, and the lives lost as a consequence. <br /> <br />The aspect of this book that impacted my world view was the acknowledgment that the country was different after the war.  This is an obvious statement.  But McPherson explains a point that I \\"knew\\" but never really thought about: the South represented, in McPherson's words, the mainstream of the world, that is, it had more in common with the majority of Europe.  It was the North that was \\"radical\\".  All in all, I find myself pleased that the radical view won out.	2004-10-08

It's good to see it's coming back into print.   <br /> <br />Skal charts the history of Stoker's book, beginning with early drafts extant, following the tangled film history, including the legal battles over Murnau's \\"Nosferatu\\", Universal Studio's struggle to get the rights for the Lugosi pic, and everything that happened after.   <br /> <br />It won't change your life, but its fascinating stuff.  Skal's style is quick, clean, and to the point.  This book is a lot of fun, giving insights into publishing, film, theater, and the audience reaction to and participation in all of those mediums.  A must for all vampire buffs, film students, and those who are curious about the inner workings of popular culture.	2004-10-08
US	49102989	R1M88YPFBMXV4E	1563896974	628025598	Swamp Thing VOL 03: The Curse	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Well-deserved reputation for Greatness	The third collection of the Moore-Bissette-Totleben run on \\"Swamp Thing\\" proves to (so far, I haven't read the whole series yet) the most chilling of the run, as the Swamp Thing begins to understand the extent of his power as the Earth elemental, while encountering all manner of horrors, including the first appearance of DC-Vertigo mainstay, John Constantine.    The strength of this collection lies in the unusual approach to some pretty basic horror icons.  \\"The Nukeface Papers\\" introduces an urban-legend brought to life, while at the same time raising the specter of the dumping of nuclear waste.  In \\"Still Waters\\", Swamp Thing does battle with a group of vampires that have taken to living underwater, and the hellish offspring they have produced.  In \\"The Curse\\", Swamp Thing encounters a werewolf with a tragic twist.  And in \\"Southern Change\\", Swamp Thing must battle the poltergeists of the past, as an old plantation becomes the set of a soap opera set in the Antebellum South, and the cast become vehicles for the unresolved tragedy of slavery.      And through most of this is Constantine, his abrasive manipulation and sense of guilt fully formed (although looking more like musician Sting under Bissette and Totleben's are then later artists depict him).  Constantine knows something is coming, and he knows he needs to make Swamp Thing ready for it.  But, in what has become typical of the character, Constantine sees no particular reason to simply tell anyone what he's up too.  Thus, the bond between Swamp Thing and Constantine is built on necessity and mistrust, which reverberates to this day.    While Moore is matchless in his ability to think outside the box, these ideas would mean nothing if not for Bissette's and Totleben's depictions.  The image of a group of vampires draining on a swimmer, and then diving deeper into a city long ago submerged is chilling.  The deformed Nukeface, long ago addicted to waste, and rotting from the inside out, is appropriately sobering and nauseating.  Slavery, always a disturbing topic, is made more disturbing as modern people are forced into roles that are morally repugnant to them, and forced to live out the past, while corpses of long dead slaves rise from the ground.  It's harder to think of a more perfect fusion of writing and art in this medium.      This represents the best comic books have to offer.  Fans would be foolish not to at least give these stories a try.	2004-09-30

It's just because Stan Sakai produces some of the most consistently entertaining and satisfying reads in the comic book marketplace.  So you can rave about one book, and in essence, rave about all.<br /><br />Which isn't to say that no one book stands out.  They do, for different reasons.  But there is such a deceptively simple and straightforward quality to this series, that at some point, a reader just takes for granted that you're getting something good, because you always do.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar, Myamoto Usagi is a masterless samurai, a ronin, who travels feudal Japan seeking adventure.  And he's an anthropomorphic rabbit.  Indeed, every character is a \\"funny\\" animal.  But don't let that put you off.  The funny animals are just a means of making the series more distinct.  Sakai's stories are still very basic and recognizable stories of human beings living, and dying, in a precarious and decadent time and place.<br /><br />The stories found in volume 7 are perfect examples of Sakai's gift.  The centerpiece is \\"Gen\\", in which Sakai finally reveals the tragic origins of Usagi's fellow ronin and (mostly) friend, Gen (a rhino).  Gen has been (and continues to be) a skilled fighter, who never let's anything stand between him and his pay-off.  But when the two samurai have a chance encounter with a dishonored lady bent on revenge, we finally learn how Gen came to be such a great fighter and why he's taken such a cynical view of the world.  The story proves touching and tragic, and makes Gen more sympathetic in the reader's eyes.<br /><br />Other stories include \\"Kitsune\\", introducing a young (fox)woman who's street peformances aid her primary source of income:  theft.  Kitsune has appeared in subsequent volumes, sharing and amusing and frustrating relationship with Usagi.  In her second story, \\"The Return of Kistune\\", Kistuneinadvertently uses her fast fingers to obtain a letter incriminating the local magistrate.  Naturally, the chase in on, and Usagi comes to her rescue.<br /><br />There is a touch of the supernatural involved in these stories as well, as Usagi encounters vengeful ghosts in his childhood, battles a cannibal demon eating samurai on the run, and helps a ghost to his final rest.<br /><br />This book provides a pretty good sample of your average Usgai volume.  While you don't need to read them in order to appreciate them (I didn't) it does underline the bigger picture that Sakai is painting to do so.  They're all back in print, so go get them.	2004-09-24
US	49102989	R301AM7SS95CZA	1563890348	168497267	Doom Patrol, Book 1: Crawling From the Wreckage	Books	5	17	18	N	N	Early Morrison - - It makes sense!	While Grant Morrison is a mostly great comic book writer, it's not unheard of for him write comics that are so abstract as to be nearly incomprehensible.  I suspect that is because Morrison understands his ideas so well, that when he finally writes them down, he forgets that we the readers don't understand them.  Consequently, he leaves pieces out, and leaves us to our own devices.      However, in his early work, that tendency isn't quite present.  These stories have a full beginning, middle, and end, and so are completely comprehensible.  Such is the case with this \\"Doom Patrol\\", collecting his first issues on this series, in which he deconstructed a basic super-hero team, attempting to take it back to its quirky 1960s roots, but at the same time looking forward to the then-distant 21st century.    The great strength of the series is that Morrison knew which characters to keep, which to change, and which to jettison.  Thus, team mainstay Cliff Steele, Robotman, a human brain in a robot body, and team founder Nile Cauler, the Chief, are here.  So is Larry Trainor, Negative Man, a pilot possessed by a parasite composed of negative energy.  But in Morrison's first signal that things are changing, that energy being forces the combination of Trainor and a woman, creating Rebis.  And new characters include the ingenious Crazy Jane, a woman with multiple personality disorder, whose every personality has some super-power, and the sympathetic Dorothy Spinner, your average teenage girl, who has an ape-like physique and the ability to create creatures out of whole cloth with her mind.      Further, the plots are strange, unusual, but make perfect sense, like a fictional city intruding on reality, inhabited by Scissormen, or Red Jack, a nearly omnipotent being who believes himself to be God, but was also Jack the Ripper.      The tragedy of this series is that, thanks to a questionable editorial decision earlier this year, these stories are no longer part of continuity, as the Doom Patrol has been started from scratch.  A shame, since this series really changed a lot abut the medium.  Comics were never the same, for no other reason that Grant Morrison still writes.	2004-09-22
US	49102989	R6PB551PDMNCI	0671470450	344790451	Legion	Books	4	42	44	N	N	Successful follow-up to "The Exorcist"	After I finished reading William Peter Blatty's \\"The Exorcist,\\" I immediately picked up and read \\"Legion.\\"  I don't know if sequel is quite the right word for this book.  Bill Kinderman, a detective from \\"The Exorcist,\\" is the protagonist of this novel, but the plot doesn't quite pick up where the plot of the \\"The Exorcist\\" left off, not really.  Nonetheless, certain plot elements in the first book are relevant to \\"Legion.\\"  I suspect that Blatty wrote this book as a sort of denunciation of the film \\"Exorcist II,\\" hardly unheard of in the literary film (see, e.g., Robert Bloch's \\"Psycho II\\" in comparison with the film, or Larry McMurtry's \\"Streets of Laredo\\" in comparison with the telepic \\"Return to Lonesome Dove.\\")  Ironically enough, \\"Legion\\" itself was turned into a film, directed by Blatty, but studio interference made it \\"Exorcist III.\\"      The plot is simple (in fact, in 2004 it's almost cliched): Kinderman investigates a series of particularly gruesome torture murders occurring around Georgetown that are connected somehow to another series in San Francisco a decade before committed by the \\"Gemini\\" (obvious nod to the real \\"Zodiac.\\")  The problem is, Gemini is dead.  So who's doing this new series, and what does the psychiatric ward of hospital have to do with them?  Through all this, Kinderman is battling with his faith, trying to reconcile his ideas of an omniscient, omnipotent, compassionate God with the horror of what goes on in the world on a daily basis.    The book is quite chilling throughout.  A deeper analysis is called for, perhaps, but that would undercut some of the power of this book as it would give away far too much.  Suffice it to say, Kinderman finds himself battling a creature he is coming to believe is not really quite human.      One glaring flaw of the book is Kinderman's soliloquies on the nature of good and evil as he goes forth to fight monsters.  These are frequent, and more often than not interrupt the flow of the book.  While I realize that Blatty's primary purpose was probably dealing with these issues, a less obtrusive way would have made for a better book.    Another problem is the denouement, which only clarifies so much, but leaves other plot lines untouched.  Consequently, a subplot involving a doctor who may or may not be the killer, while at times spooky, ultimately winds up being only vaguely consequential (the film simply drops it, making for a stronger story).  Also, the ending is abrupt, and feels somewhat unsatisfying (again, the film built up some of these threads, but that ending isn't wholly satisfying either).      These flaws having been acknowledged, the novel is mostly a success.  When not rambling, Kinderman is a thoroughly engaging hero.  His interactions with his family, colleagues, and friends (particularly Father Joseph Dyer, another survivor of \\"The Exorcist\\"), are crisp, smart, touching, and believable.      \\"Legion\\" is a must for horror fans looking to be engaged at multiple levels.  While not perfect, it succeeds where it needs to, and makes a good read.	2004-09-09
US	49102989	R1HXKBYYSTLVHE	0061007226	257277061	The Exorcist	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Surprisingly Excellent	I saw the film \\"The Exorcist\\" years ago, and found it wanting.  Nonetheless, I did file away the book on my mental \\"must read\\" list.  With interest in the original film renewed by the   prequel film, I figured now was as good a time as any to read it.  I am quite pleased that I did.    The basic premise should be known to all.  A young girl, Regan MacNeil, begins exhibiting horrifying behavior, and it is soon determined that she is possessed by a demon, and an exorcism takes place.  What I found amazing about the novel is just how effective William Peter Blatty is in developing the course of plot. I knew what the ultimate story of the novel is, and yet I found myself on edge.  The is due almost entirely do to Blatty's effective descriptions of Regan's behavior while possessed, which are grotesquely sexual in nature, as well as generally violent.  Her conversations with the novel's main protagonist, Father Damien Karras, are also frighteningly vivid.    Another of the novel's great strengths is the development of its two main characters: Chris MacNeil, and Farther Karras.  I found Chris initially to be a fairly unpleasant character when Blatty introduced her.  She is demanding, controlling, and vaguely unhappy.  Her only true seems joy to be her daughter.  However, as the novel progresses, Chris engenders a great deal of sympathy, as her ordered world falls apart around her ears, and her daughter is victimized of something she cannot fight off through conventional means.    Likewise, Blatty's depiction of Karras is masterful, as we see a priest who understands the world too much, and as such, finds himself uncomfortable with his role of priest, but at the same time giving himself to the duty willingly.  His ultimate fate is tragic, to say the least.    The novel is far from perfect.  The dialogue at times does feel forced, and more suited to a screenplay.  The character of Detective Kinderman is particularly hurt by this tendency.  While it is his admitted style to come off as a goofball, there were many times I wondered if he'd just shut up and get to the point.  There is a subplot involving the MacNeil household help which tends to be a red herring, as well as a commentary on society.  Blatty doesn't fully succeed at either goal.      And the titular exorcist, Father Merrin, feels like a lost opportunity.  I felt this way about the film, as well.  Merrin's past is hinted at.  Blatty acknowledges that Merrin has battled this particular demon before, but beyond that, we know nothing about the character.  A little more depth would have gone a long way.    All in all, I enjoyed the novel, and I am particularly surprised at just HOW MUCH I enjoyed it.  Now I think another viewing of the film is in order.	2004-09-02
US	49102989	R7LKJSBHUTK90	0345461509	812787082	The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane	Books	5	12	12	N	Y	High Adventure with the Puritan swordsman	Robert E. Howard is most famous for his character Conan.  However, Howard was writing adventure characters long before Conan.  Among the more popular of these is his English Puritan swordsman, Solomon Kane.<br /><br />Kane is definitely an interesting character.  He shares certain traits with Conan, including fighting skill, a love of adventure, and a nefarious past.  Unlike Conan, Kane is a far more righteous in his motivations.  While Conan was never evil, he was definitely a man who allowed himself to be ruled by his passions.  He did what he believed necessary for his survival.  If that happened to be the right thing, so much the better.  If he engaged in thievery (which he often did), he did so without hesitation.  Kane's passions are more submerged, obscured by his hatred of what he believes to be \\"evil\\".  He hunts murderers, thieves, and demons because he wishes to inflict punishment on them.<br /><br />The tales found in this volume are all terrific.  While some are better than others, not once did I feel like I had wasted my time upon reaching the end of a story, which is always a possibility while reading an anthology.  Howard's imagery is vivid, as Kane chases ghosts and fights duels in England, and pursues French bandits, evil kingdoms, and flying monsters in Africa.  The stories are by turns funny, exhilarating, chilling, and creepy, and always satisfying.  While Howard's prose had its \\"purple\\" moments, he never takes the reader out of the story by overwriting.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have with this volume is aimed at its editors.  The first Conan collection included a couple of essays that examined how Howard created Conan, the nature of Conan cycle of stories, and general insights into Howard's state of mind.  \\"Solomon Kane\\" has no such essays.  This is unfortunate, as some of the stories in this volume are unfinished fragments, without any explanation for why Howard never finished them.  Some insight into why Howard departed slightly from his more usual \\"barbarian\\" approach with the Puritan Kane (although, the \\"Anglo-Saxon Barbarian\\" is always just below the surface) would have been nice.<br /><br />However, this is a minor concern that in no way reduces enjoyment of this volume, or its rating.  It is excellent.barbarian\\" approach with the Puritan Kane (although, the \\"Anglo-Saxon Barbarian\\" is always just below the surface) would have been nice.

The first volume of a new trilogy (but the seventh in a larger series), RE covers the first sixth months of an alternate Second World War.  After the US defeated the CS in the Great War (chronicled in the original \\"Great War\\" trilogy), the US rested on its laurels in the period between the wars, while the CS began a move toward a totalitarian regime led by an embittered Great War veteran, Jake Featherston (chronicled in the \\"American Empire\\" trilogy).  In Europe, we learn that the US's main ally, the German Empire, was faced with similar problems as both France and Russia saw a restoration of vengence-minded monarchies, and Britain saw revanchist, quasi-fascist forces make inroads into the government, barely held in check by Winston Churchill.        \\"Return Engagement\\" begins in June, 1941, as Featherston has ordered a blitzkrieg attack into the Midwest US, pushing for the Great Lakes, with the ultimate goal of cowing the US.  The US, largely unprepared militarily and psychologically for such an attack, must scramble under the leadership of Al Smith to fight a seemingly unstoppable foe, while suppressing yet another Mormon rebellion in Utah, and keeping a wary eye on Canada, which has been under US domination since 1917.  At the same time, Featherston institutes a \\"final solution\\" to the \\"problem\\" of African-Americans in the CS.      Turtledove's strengths lie in his ability to create a vivid, detailed world, at once painfully similar and mercifully different from our own.  His characters are on the whole very well drawn.  Most are truly likeable people, doing the best they can to survive in a less than forgiving world.  The others are essentially evil incarnate.  As has been mentioned, some 14 characters give us their point of view, thus giving a nice cross section of North America.  Unfortunately, each POV is given about four pages ashot.  So favored characters sometimes feel as if they have been given short shrift, whereas less favored characters get too much time on center stage.      The most obvious weakness of the book is its position as part of a series.  The war actually began in the last pages of \\"American Empire: The Victorious Opposition\\".  And, since this is the first book of a trilogy (within an overall series), very little has yet been resolved.  The book ends on a cliffhanger, as the neither side has a the absolute upper-hand.  New readers to this series MUST start at the beginning to fully appreciate what exactly has gone before, and why the world is in the position it is now.      \\"Return Engagement\\" represents one of the strongest books in the series thus far.  For those who have been following the series, this book will prove most rewarding.	2004-08-15

Jack Cole's reputation stands primarily on the reputation of his most famous character, Plastic Man, and rightly so. These stories are terrific treats from the Golden Age of comics, and demonstrate why so many people rate Cole as one of the great comic book creators, often naming him in the same sentence with Will Eisner.      Plastic Man first appeared in the anthology series &quot;Police Comics&quot; #1, published in 1941 by Quality Comics (DC obtained Quality's stable after Quality went out of business). In his foreword, Will Eisner recalls that Cole had been hired by Quality to more or less produce a clone to Eisner's own &quot;The Spirit&quot;. Instead, Cole took a different route, creating his own distinct Plastic Man.      For those not familiar with the character, criminal Eel O'Brien leads a gang of crooks on a robbery in a chemical plant. When the police arrive, Eel is shot. Acid seeps into his wound. Left behind by his men, Eel escapes the police, and is rescued by a kindly monk. The next morning, Eel discovers that the acid has given his body elastic abilities, allowing him to take any shapes. Touched by the monk's kindness, Eel resolves to use his powers for good, and takes on the identity of Plastic Man. Working as Eel, he is able to get inside info on criminal gangs. As Plastic Man, he works in the employ of the police (and later the FBI) to take down criminals.       Plastic Man faces a variety of criminals, some fairly conventional (a dope ring, a group of Axis spies) to the bizarre (a brain that won't die, a thug whose lower body has been replaced by a peg, and man-eating trees). He also gets a sidekick, another former criminal, Woozy Winks. After saving a mystic's live, Woozy lives under a spell which protects him from all harm. As the series progresses, his power is a little less constant. Largely, Winks is a terrific running joke.      &quot; The Plastic Man Archives Vol. 1&quot; collects the Plastic Man stories from &quot;Police Comics&quot; #s1-20, which covers a great deal of material. We get to see a variety of changes in Plastic Man's commercial career. In the first issue, Plastic Man was the fourth or fifth story, and the cover belonged to a character called Firebrand. Subsequently, Plastic Man become the star of the covers, sharing only with Eisner's Spirit, whose adventures were being reprinted in &quot;Police&quot;. The page count of the stories went up, and Cole began using the Eisnerian technique of a splash page to introduce the story.       But Cole never simply aped Eisner, or anyone else. Plastic Man stayed distinct, maintaining a precarious balance between laugh out loud funny, and out-and-out creepy. This is particularly interesting in light of the fact that since Cole's death, Plastic Man has been played mostly for laughs (see, e.g., Kyle Baker's current series published by DC). Cole had no problem with depicting acts of violence juxtaposed with comedy. People unfamiliar with the original work will find this a bit jarring. Nonetheless, Cole could and did make the balance work.      DC seems to have fast tracked this particular Archive series. This a good thing. I look forward to picking up the rest of the series.	2004-07-30

This has been due entirely to his tendency to intersperse what are essentially treatises in his fiction. Indeed, there are times when the action of his stories quite literally stops as his characters engage various hypotheses and philosophical points. <br />Wasn't it amazing how everyone seemed to have some vague grasp of chaos theory in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;? Did anyone else find the pages of dissection of gorilla communication through sign-language in &quot;Congo&quot; just a bit prosaic?<br />However, as I have been discovering Crichton's earlier work, I find this problem virtually non-existent. He was using the &quot;mock non-fiction&quot; approach in his novels from the begining, but it felt less intrusive and simply enriched the reading experience. <br />Case in point, &quot;Eaters of the Dead. This gem, published in 1976 (ironically, just before &quot;Congo&quot;;the change must have happened over night), is a completely successful attempt to tell the &quot;true story&quot; of the epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;. <br />The narrative structure is based on the memoirs of one Ibn Fadlan, a courtier to the Caliph of Baghdad. Ibn Fadlan was a real person, and Crichton has blended aspects of the true memoir into his fictional novel. Ibn Fadlan is on a mission to Europe, but is sidetracked when, during a visit to the Scandinavians, he is drafted by a chief, Buliwyf, to aid the kingdom of Rathar against a fearsome tribe of cannibalistic marauders, the wendol. <br />The strength of this novel is the writing. It reads as such documents read. Matter of fact, largely candid, with certain turns of phrase that are dated. The action sequences are quite chilling. But so are Ibn Fadlan's experiences of the Northmen's culture, as we learn what exactly went into a Viking funeral. It wasn't just burning ships. <br />Crichton creates a fanciful tale, but manages to ground it in reality. At the same time, he is always mindful of his source material. Anyone who has read &quot;Beowulf&quot; will recognize various nods to that poem, which will enhance reading pleasure. However, one needn't a degree in English lit to appreciate this book.<br />Overall, this novel made me feel nostalgic for a time when Crichton's main goal was telling a good story through the integration of historical fact, rather than disguising non-fiction works as novels. Definitely a keeper.	2004-07-19

But it becomes clear that this has nothing to do with gangs, but everything to do with an extremely violent serial killer.  What's even more frightening is that this killer has targeted Patrick and Angie, and their respective loved ones.  Worst of all, the killer has some connection to their childhood that Patrick doesn't begin to understand, and the killer may not be working alone.  <br />Lehane's strength is that he doesn't make it easy to make moral pronouncements.  The characters act and react based on needs and emotion (often rage)--they don't have the luxury of always doing the moral thing as prescribed by society.  But, Patrick and Angie are still beautifully human and wonderfully sympathetic, even as they do the &quot;wrong&quot; thing, for both the right and the wrong reasons.  They really want to be good people, but know they aren't quite there.  At the core of there relationship is a fraternal love that never quite moves away from it's less platonic overtones.  <br />Lehane beautifully blends exciting action with suspense and meditations on the human condition.  This isn't a nice world that our heroes live in.  It's an ugly, violent world, where unfortunately, they help perpetuate that violence.  Lehane makes you keep turning the page, even though you know bad things are probably going to happen.  I am looking forward to reading the rest in the series, as well as Shutter Island.	2004-05-08

But it soon becomes apparent that there is something far more to this groundless accusation as the city pushes a case that is worthless on its face.      Vachss demonstrates once again how good he is at dealing with the underside of society.  His characters are hard-bitten, hard-fighting, fully fleshed out people, who are horribly damaged, in many aspects unsavory, and completely lovable.      But I was surprised at the relatively soft touch Vachss brought to this book.  There's a great deal of tenderness in Burke, hinted at previously, that shines through more than usual.  He's not above hurting people to get the job done, even appearing to enjoy it in some instances, but Burke seems to be tired of this violent life of his.  The result is an unusually soulful entry in a series that is the very definition of hardboiled.	2004-04-26
US	49102989	RXW8S4KWLXEZF	0345315758	991527109	The Return of Tarzan, Vol. 2	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Entertaining, better than the films.	Like most people, I encountered Tarzan in movies, but only about a year ago got around to reading the first book.  What a different experience.  I don't think I've seen a movie that was very faithful to the novel.  \\"Greystoke\\" got the tone and theme, if not the narrative.  What's is essential to the books, and usually left out of the screenplays, is Tarzan's ability to live in the jungle, but to function in \\"civilized\\" society as well.<br />The second novel (like the first) is essentially episodic.  Tarzan, having renounced Jane Porter's love and his title, embarks on a series of adventures, including saving a woman's honor, surviving a duel, traveling to the Middle East as a secret agent, and finally finding himself marooned in the jungle he grew up, and discovering the city of Opar. <br />Overall, the novel entertains.  Tarzan remains a solid character.  Occasionally, Burroughs' prose tends towards purple, and some of the dialogue can be stilted.  There are also certain descriptions of the native African peoples which aren't terribly enlightened.  However, the whole book is a blast.	2004-03-02
US	49102989	R33YSBGONBL81O	068482535X	799300305	Lincoln	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Excellent	I'm not typically a biography fan.  I'm a history buff, but I tend to prefer reading about events in history, and getting relevant information about the players in those events within the context of that event.  <br />But, I saw a copy of Donald's book a couple of years agao in a bookstore at a discount, and snagged it.  Naturally, the course of events required me to shift it down on my reading pile.  Recently, I resolved to read it once and for all.<br />I'm pleased that I did.  First, what I know of Lincoln came in broad strokes-what he did mostly, little of what he did.  I'm also not a Civil War buff (just more interested in WW II).  So my knowledge of both has been greatly enhanced.  (Admittedly, Donald wasn't quite interested in parsing out the War, so I will have to pursue that information elsewhere.)<br />Donald's examination is as even a work as one could ask for.  While he admires Lincoln, he's willing to acknowledge that the Lincoln was human, and takes him to task when appropriate.  <br />What I enjoyed most about this book is that I recognized certain traits in my personality that are similar to Lincoln.  I don't flatter myself that I'm somehow a &quot;great&quot; man, but rather, I use this to illustrate how down-to-earth Lincoln really was, and how beautifully Donald illustrates that quality.<br />I don't know that this is the be-all-end-all of Lincoln bios.  But, as a single volume piece, it's terrific, and more than worth the time of both historians and casual readers alike.	2004-02-21
US	49102989	RXA09BIPGIPWJ	0375758267	45103098	Kingdom of Shadows	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Good WWII thriller, but not Furst's best	Nicholas Morath, a Hungarian national living in Paris just a couple of years before the start of World War II.  As the nephew of a Hungarian count, Morath finds himself mired in the intrigue and futile battles to prevent Hungary from aligning with the Axis.  <br />I've now read four Furst novels, including Kingdom of Shadows.  I have to say, this was my least favorite.  While it is still great, there was a certain complexity missing here.  Morath is a good man, who's only discernable flaw is that he smokes too much.  He's a victim of history, not a maker of history, which is true of all of Furst's heroes, but he's not terribly complex.  Unlike some of the protagonists of Furst's novels, Morath know from the get go what is right.  He doesn't grow much, and that detracts from the novel.<br />However, Furst is still excellent in his descriptions.  The action does move reasonably well, and the settings are vividly evoked.  It's also a testament to Furst's talent that he can make known historical events (e.g. Austria's annexation or Stalin's overtures to Hitler) and make them feel \\"enormous\\" and surprising.  <br />Overall, good enough, but not my favorite Furst book.	2004-01-21
US	49102989	R2C6ME0BR1C4QO	0688163165	733601761	Mystic River	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Powerful and heartbreaking	Mystic River is the first Lehane novel I've read.  It will NOT be the last.<br />This novel is amazing.  As a mystery, it's predictable.  I knew pretty well who had killed Katie Marcus by about page 150.  But, really, that's not what the book is about.  It's about pain and fragility of the human condition, as all good crime novels are about.<br />The plot is pretty simple.  Three childhood friends are reunited by the murder of a young woman.  Jimmy Marcus, the girl's father, is an ex-con who has been on the straight and narrow for years.  Sean Divine is the cop investigating the murder.  Dave Boyle, who as a boy was kidnaped and abused, is related to Jimmy by marriage; he's also the prime suspect.<br />As the novel progresses, it's obvious that this murder is just the beginning of a series of tragedies, as each character tries to decipher how best to handle this awful crime.  The conclusion is heartbreaking and sickening, and completely unforgettable.<br />An excellent novel.	2004-01-21
US	49102989	R374LESUU2MBJX	0553578294	841298837	Smoker (Atticus Kodiak)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A well developed protagonist makes this series a success	I've read Rucka's first three novels (Keeper, Finder, Smoker)after reading some of his comic book work.  What astounds me about the Atticus Kodiak novels (so far) is there consistency.  Atticus is a living breathing person, made more so by his imperfections.  I agree with an earlier reviewer that I was screaming &quot;Idiot&quot; as much as I was cheering him on.  In this way Rucka's books are like Owen Parry's Abel Jones series, as both featuring people who are as close to reality a fictional character can get. You have your disagreements with them, and yet you know at the end of the day you like and respect them, and would be proud to call them friend.<br />Returning to &quot;Smoker&quot;, I don't think this is my favorite of the series, but it is still an excellent book. Atticus Kodiak finds himself guarding a key witness against the tobacco industry.  While Rucka does make his view of this debate known, it isn't the primary focus of the novel.  Wisely, Rucka focuses on Kodiak's battle with a master assassin, who hangs over the proceedings like a grim fog; Kodiak knows the assassin is there, but doesn't know what that person has in store.<br />While the ending is a little weak, the overall novel is a definite success of tension, suspense, and human conflict, from the battle between killer and protector, on to the mundane interactions of people in their daily lives.  Rucka gets it right in ways that certain people in the genre have not.	2003-10-08
US	49102989	R194U4BBWFJIX7	0141439335	517218957	Raffles: The Amateur Cracksman	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Nifty bit of Victoriana	A.J. Raffles is the consumate English gentleman.  He's quick witted, polite, has a spotless appearance, excels at cricket . . . and earns his living by burglary.  <br />Horung's Raffles is a sort of counter to Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, using his intellect for theft rather than for detection.  With his sidekick and chronicler Bunny, Raffles has a series of adventures where pulling of the crime is the key, not catching the criminal.  Oddly, Raffles, though a scamp, isn't a monster.  He's not a killer, although he contemplates it in the story &quot;Wilful Murder&quot;.  Also, he's not always sucessful, as in the story &quot;Costume Piece&quot;, where Raffles and Bunny escape by the skin of their teeth, empty-handed.<br />This book is good fun all around.  The Penguin edition adds to the fun by extensively annotating the text, giving insight into Horung's sources and motivations.  Definitely recommended for people who like Victorian stories, drawing rooms mysteries, crime novels, and mild satires of conventions.	2003-09-25
US	49102989	R31D8C1EGYR0ZZ	0785110623	949818402	Spider-Man: Blue	Books	3	5	8	N	N	I expected better	I enjoy Spider-man.  I enjoy Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale.  And yet they all didn't mesh very well.  Admittedly, I read the story as it came out over six issues.  If I reread it, I might feel differently.    In the present-day, Peter Parker speaks into a tape-recorder, reminiscing about his late girlfriend, Gwen Stacy (about when Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr. were on the book, a great period), and the conflicts that arose from his love for her, his unresolved feelings for Mary Jane Watson (now his wife), and that fact that he is Spider-man.  In between all of these concerns, Spider-man finds that many of his foes seem to be coming at him in a concentrated effort, suggesting an intelligent force at work.    The problem with this story does not lie with the creative team exactly.  Loeb writes with passion and empathy, creating a meloncholoy atmosphere of simpler times, comparatively speaking, in Peter Parker's life.  Sale doesn't try to compete with Romita, a smart move, and so brings his own unique style to the proceedings.      The main problem with this story is the fact that Loeb is essentially retelling stories already told.  I read these stories in the Essential Spider-man.  While Loeb does add the little bit of the surprise villain, it feels somewhat forced.  I don't mind ret-conning or retelling, so long as there is some purpose to it.  Here, the main purposes of the story are for Loeb and Sale to pay homage to Lee and Romita's run, and re-examine that run in a modern light.  That's frustrating, as I loved \\"Batman:  The Long Halloween,\\" \\"Dark Victory\\", and \\"Superman For All Seasons\\".  But this creative team's Marvel \\"year one\\" stories (this and \\"Daredevil: Yellow\\") have kind have left me cold.  This is certainly because Marvel's continutiy is very tight, and retroactively fitting stuff in is almost impossible.    Thus, a perfectly good story is overshadowed by familiarity, and it's very hard to judge on its own merits.  It may be the case that in a few years, when Ire-read this, I'll find it stands better on its own.  As it is, it feels ultimately redundant.	2003-06-20
US	49102989	RVGVXQPGFZCDV	1563899329	944184907	Batman: The Dynamic Duo - Archives, Volume 1 (Archive Editions (Graphic Novels))	Books	5	41	43	N	N	Excellent Batman classics	I'm not certain why DC decided to jump ahead in its Batman Archives from Golden Age to Silver Age, creating fourth Batman series, in addition to \\"Batman Archives\\" (covering Golden Age Batman stories from \\"Detective Comics\\", Batman's original title), \\"Batman: the Dark Knight Archives\\" (collecting the Golden Age \\"Batman\\" series), and \\"Batman: the World's Finest Comics\\" (covering the Golden Age stories in \\"World's Finest\\").  This volume differs in that it collects stories starting in 1963 (jumping from Batman vol 5 which ends in 1947), and it features a mix of issues of \\"Batman\\" and \\"Detective Comics\\".<br />I suspect this decision stems from the nature of the stories in \\"Dynamic Duo\\".  This was a \\"break-point\\" in the Batman mythos.  While Batman had been a hit from the minute he appeared in 1939, in the fifties, do to (in retrospect) poor editorial decisions prodded by the anti-comics hoopla of the time, Batman had become pretty watered down.  While there was some goofiness in the early going, most of Batman's stories were pretty grim and violent, with Batman battling thieves, thugs, and murderers.<br />But in the fifties, Batman and Robin ran around in daylight, battling such menaces as the Beast from 19 feet below the sea etc.  The mystery was taken out, and Ace the Bat-hound was put in.<br />This approach had worked quite well with Superman.  By all accounts, it failed miserably with Batman.  Thus, by the early sixties, Batman was on the verge of cancellation.  Enter Julius Schwartz and company, who'd dones an excellent job of re-animating many of DC's stable of heroes.  And the first order of business was to make Batman a detective again.  And they succeeded admirably.<br />Now, not every story in this collection is a gem.  Nor did they completely return Batman to his dark roots.  At least one giant sci-fi monster makes an appearance, and the Joker, the only major villain to appear, is still a little more goofy than homicidal.  But, having read some of the fifties silliness, these stories are a vast improvement.<br />Perhaps the most important change to the status quo is the death of Alfred the butler, killed while saving the Dynamic Duo.  This story, while touching, and showing that the new team meant business, also is problematic, as our heroes are given about a page to grieve the loss of this important character.<br />Whatever the reasons DC decided to bring out this edition earlier than expected, I am glad that they did.  The stories have a great exuberence and a certain level of depth (not a huge amount, but it's there) of character and plot development not found in the Golden Age stuff.  Heck even the big monster story, \\"The Man Who Quit the Human Race\\", about a scientist who evolves several millenia physically and mentally, is great fun, and still involves Batman and Robin using they're detective skills to defeat the monster.<br />Another favorite story, along with Alfred's death and the evolving man, is the \\"Two-way Deathtrap\\", in which Bruce Wayne has a recurring nightmare about being trapped in water, surrounded by smooth walls, and guns on each side, a trap he cannot escape.  When a gang of crooks discovers this dream they immediately put the trap together.  Batman falls into it.  Naturally, he escapes, but just how he escapes is the key to the success of this story.<br />In conclusion, I can't recommend this collection too enthusiastically.  It's a real treat for Batman fans, comic fans, and pop culture fans.  Be sure to pick it up, and hopefully, DC will continue this series for the foreseeable future.  And not to worry Golden Age fans;  \\"Batman:  Dark Knight Archives\\" vol 4 is scheduled to hit comic stores later in July.

Indeed, I'm not too overwhelmed by what I have read of Richard Matheson overall, which is not much, admittedly.  I liked &quot;I Am Legend&quot; quite a bit.  &quot;Hell House&quot; is at times gripping, creepy, and silly.  While always entertaining, it's too silly to really be effective as a horror novel.<br />The horror of this novel really comes from the nature of Hell House itself.  The creepiest moments of this novel come when the history of the house is recounted.  However, much of that horror is undone by the novel's central conceit that even the supernatural can be handled by scientific means, and that even ghosts can be banished with the right tools.  This ultimate solution pretty much drains the horror out of the proceedings.<br />While Matheson is a solid writer, the plot here never suspends disbelief.  &quot;Hell House&quot; is a page turner, with a lot of atmosphere, but a minimum of chills in favor of rationalizing phantoms.	2003-06-20

From interviews I have heard Furst give, I suspect that this statement was Furst's way of speaking directly to the audience and sharing his world view.  <br />Furst's stated purpose in writing is to demonstrate how essentially good people fight evil, but can also aid and abett that same evil.  Case in point is our protagonist Szara.  A former NKVD agent, Szara has been a party to much of the evil perpetrated by Stalin.  And yet, when push comes to shove, Szara, out of some feelings of self-preservation as much as altruism, rebels.  <br />Thus, while \\"Dark Star\\" is not my favorite Alan Furst novel, this is, I believe, his most personal, and most relevant to today's world.  <br />Plus, it's a ... fine novel set in WWII.<br />A must read.	2003-06-20

Thus, when DC announced it would be reprinting \\"THUNDER Agents\\" as part of its Archive line, I made a point of picking the book up.<br />The legend is true.  \\"THUNDER Agents\\" is terrific stuff.  The artwork clear and crisp, the stories the right mix of pathos and action.<br />For those unfamiliar here's a quick synopsis.  The world is threatened by a would-be conqueror called the Warlord.  A scientist, developing new weapons, dies at the Warlord's hand, but not before he completes his inventions.  THUNDER, an enforcement arm of the UN, gets ahold of them, and quickly creates their own super-hero team to fight the Warlord.<br />Dynamo wears the the dynabelt, a device that allows him superstrength, but only for 30 minutes.  After that, the belt starts to drain him.<br />Noman is a scientist who can shift his mind throughout several android bodies.  If he runs out, he'll die.  He also wears the invisibility cloak, which is on a time limit.<br />Menthor actually is a double agent working for the Warlord.  But when he puts on his helmet, which allows him ESP and mind controll abilities, his good side is brought to the surface.<br />Lightning wears a costume that increases his speed, but cuts his life-span down a little bit each time he uses it.<br />The THUNDER Squad is a team of non-powered adventures, each with their own specialty.<br />A complex mix of characters with various abilities and limitations, a great deal of emotional depth, and terrific art.

But. . .<br />Like the best of the plague books, this one is scary as hell (especially now).  What makes it really scary is that the plague itself isn't so terrible:  death is sudden and peaceful, not like say \\"Cap'n Trips\\" (The Stand), or HIV, small pox, etc.  And it just \\"happens\\".  <br />One of the grpies I have always had with Crichton is his preference for concepts over character, and his preference for dissertations over storytelling.

US	49102989	R1IRHKVU01VPHX	1563898969	663117582	The Enemy Ace Archives, Vol. 1 (DC Archive Editions)	Books	5	33	33	N	N	Interesting beginning to a unique character	This volume, along with \\"The Sgt. Rock Archives\\", reprints excellent work by the team of Robert Kanigher and Joe Kubert.  What is particularly astounding about both volumes is that each contain a level of maturity and depth not found in the DC Comics super-hero line at that time (which is not to say those stories are without value).  While it is not quite as sophisticated as the stories being told in comics today, both Rock and Enemy Ace tell riveting and complex stories in the war milleu.  Enemy Ace is particularly daring, telling the story of a WWI German pilot, and bringing a great sense of moral ambiguity to the procedings.<br />The key attraction of the Enemy Ace is the depth of Hans von Hammer.  He's a skilled fighter and killer, without equal, and so, he is a loner.  But above all else, he is a man of duty:  to his fatherland, to his men, and to himself.  His trophies mean nothing, the opinions of his commrades in arms mean nothing.  Only his duty.  It's this sense of duty that allows us to sympathize with this otherwise enigmatic soldier, whose only friend is a wolf in the Black Forest.  <br />There are many touches which help bring the character to life.  The almost chivalric code that pilots live by, with the loser falling to his death while saluting the victor, for example, bring the war into focus.  As does the violence.  Now, this isn't \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" of course, but Kubert and Kanigher do make it plain that the life of a pilot is nasty, brutish, and short, even for a good one.  Hammer live under a very real threat of death everytime he takes to the skies.  And Hammer knows this, making him that much more human.  <br />What is particularly interesting about this volume is there is a certain level of repetition.  Kanigher was clearly taking his time and finding his way in developing his character, trying to make him work.  Thus, we often read variations of the same dialog and themes for much of the volume.  Towards the end, Kanigher seems to have gotten hold of the character, as there is a great deal of confidence, and the repetition deminishes.  I note this not as a complaint, but with intrigue.<br />Hopefully, DC will continue publishing volumes of Enemy Ace.  While I love the \\"Big Gun\\" character, some lesser characters, like the Enemy Ace, offer great storytelling as well, if not better in some cases.  This volume is a testiment to that fact.	2003-01-30

That's rather appropriate as this book is certainly one of Hillerman's more hard-boiled books.  Much like Chandler, it meditates on the human condition, finding more dark than light, and offering at best, a few shreds of hope for all those participants who make it to the end.<br />Of all of Hillerman's books, this is his darkest.  This is not to say that his previous ones are Agatha Christie drawing room cozies.  They all had their share of grimey street-level detective work, and some have left the protaganists with dim world-views.  But let's face it, the Navajo reservation setting, the cultural trappings, and the very genial and lovable protagonists in the form of Chee and Leaphorn are the real attraction to these books, and why they stand out among mystery writers, not their dark atomosphere and cynicism.  <br />But with \\"The Wailing Wind\\", Hillerman has incorporated darker elements.  Perhaps Leaphorn should have thought of Ross MacDonald, as this book has much in common with MacDonald's work.  Here, a murder, which Leaphorn investigated long ago, continues to reach out and damage lives in the present, as Chee and Leaphorn desperately try to keep things from falling apart, and inevitably failing.  The titular wailing wind is the key to many a downfall, leaving all parties (including the reader)afloat in a sort of moral morass, like the best of Chandler, Hammet, and MacDonald.<br />Hillerman has touched on deeper elements before in his work (the ambigous ending of \\"Dancehall of the Dead\\" springs to mind), but never with so much sharpness.  This is definitely a book to remember, and a reminder why I enjoy Hillerman so much.  Eagerly awaiting the next one.	2003-01-28

All it needs is the right motivation to rise up.  As King Phillip II lies on his death-bed, England's remaining loyalists decide now is the time to strike.  But how to stir the people to rebellion?  A play's the thing, and who better to write it but William Shakespeare of course.<br />It's not that easy, of course.  Spain wants to make sure England stays loyal, and what better way to commemorate their king than with a play, written by William Shakespeare.<br />Poor Master William.  Not made for intrigue, nor gifted with great physical courage, he finds himself in the burden of his nation's sovereignty on his shoulders.  Worse, he is forced to contend with the attentions of Senior Lieutenant Lope de Vega, who is made for intrigue and is a formidible playwright of his own.<br />\\"Ruled Britannia\\" is the book that Harry Turtledove should be remembered for.  Even more than \\"Guns of the South\\", even more than \\"Worldwar\\" or \\"Great War\\".  Turtledove writes with a richness of setting and depth of character only hinted at in previous works.  He imbues Shakespeare and de Vega with complexity and depth as both play unwitting games of cat and mouse, leading from back alley murder and conspiracy, through the threat of the Inquisition, plays, romance, swashbuckling action, onward to the inevitable question:  which play will be performed?	2002-11-21
US	49102989	R2C0GBDDZAD42	0515129496	536544726	Resurrection Day	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Interesting and entertaining thriller for AH-addicts	Having just read &quot;Resurrection Day&quot;, I thought i'd share briefly my opinions, which are mostly favorable.  On the whole it makes for an entertaining book, using a a cross-pollenation of genres and sub-genres, beginning as murder myster set in an America 10 years after the Cubam Missle Crisis became a nuclear Cuban War, which crippled the US and annhilated the USSR.  It then procedes to turn into a political thriller, as our hero, Boston Globe reporter Carl Landry, delved deeper into the murdered vet and finds all manner of intrigue and danger involving the US and UK governments, military personel, and the truth about what happened in 1962.  Elements of post-apocalypse sc-fi also are present in visits to a bombed Manahattan populated by gangs and people fighting for survival.  And there is even the dystopic element, represented by a US under ten years of marshal law.<br />Carl Landry makes for an interesting and mostly sympathetic hero, and the world Brendan DuBois has created is on the whole plausible.  Certainly, it does become predictable about page 300; I had pretty well figured out the whole murder mystery by then.  And there is a certain whistful nostalgia about the nobility of JFK, and a very cynical view of Curits LeMay (renamed here as Ramsey Curtis) which seem a little simplistic, but it makes for overall an entertaining yarn, particularly for AH-addicts who might need a quick fix.	2001-02-17

I must say Harry Turtledove has brought his Worldwar/Colonization to an exciting and stirring conclusion.  His tale of a Second World War interupted by an invasion of reptiles has played out superbly over the course of seven books, and while not every moment has been a gem, the whole experience has been extremely entertaining.<br />Following the events of Down to Earth, Germany finds itself crippled, and France and Finland have regained independence after two decades of Nazi rule.  The USA and the USSR now must deal with the shift in the balance of power.  Plus, the mystery of who launched the missiles at the fleet in Second Contact, the mission of the Lewis and Clark, and who Straha's driver is are all resolved.  Naturally, not everything is tied up completely, prompting further books.<br />What is most interesting about this series is how much change has been affected not only on the world, but on the various characters who populate this world.  David Goldfarb makes his fortune using Race technology for variour commerical products (caller id being a noteworthy one).  Liu Han, originally a peasant, is now firmly entrenched in the Chinese Communist Party.  Sam Yeager, the USA's leading authority on the Race finds his life drastically, almost tragically, altered because of a little bit of knowledge he obtains.  Wounded veteran Rance Auerbach finds himself embroiled in the ginger trade.<br />There are some glitches, of course.  Certain characters appear more because for variety rather than the stories they tell.  V.N. Molotov has nothing really important to do but show the USSR's plot and schemes, but ultimately tells no interesting tales.  Monique Dutourd, while an interesting character, really doesn't have anything to do either but be a token French character, though that changes at the end. David Goldfarb too loses some momentum as the novel progresses. While I understand, and applaud, Turtledove's desire to show a wide spectrum of view points and characters, someof these characters could easily have been retired as their individual stories achieved closure.<br />Now, while Turtledove has stated he has no plans immediately write a sequel to Colonization, certainly he leaves the ending open.  Personally, I would enjoy a return to this alternate history at some point, preferally in the form of self-contained novels.  But for now, this is enough, and I would rather Turtledove concentrate on his other, very numerous, projects.<br />In the meantime, I recommend Aftershocks (after reading the previous books).  It is a first rate series in its characterization, its plots and themes, and its ability to take a very stale idea (alien invasion) and set it on its head, while taking it to its most logical conclusion.	2001-02-07
US	49102989	R1BUMGJCKC9YEG	0891415378	127792381	1901: A Novel	Books	4	49	55	N	N	Good First Novel, Uniquie Alternate History	&quot;1901&quot;, Robert Conroy's first (and, so far, only) novel, is a suprisingly well written, well thought-out work.  It isn't a masterpiece by any means, but it is a very good and entertaining alternate history that deals with a very original divergence point.  In 1901 Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, desiring a colonial empire to rival England and France, and angered by the USA's refusal to sell their newly acquired colonies from Spain, launches an invasion at New York.  As the United States has almost little or no standing army in the country, and Germany has the largest and best army in the world, it becomes clear that the United States may very well lose this war.<br />  Conroy does pretty well with his divergence.  It's plausible, which is the golden rule of alternate history.  Conroy makes the reader believe that there could have been German troops wandering around Brooklyn and Manhattan, and portrays convincingly a U.S. government, led by Theodore Roosevelt, desperately trying to fight off these very aggressive, very professional invaders.  Conroy is also particularly effective in evoking images underlining the brutallity of war.  Men are mowed down, heads explode, bodies break, soldiers scream, and cities burn.  Essentially, Conroy creates a microcosm of the First World War on American soil.  <br /> Conroy also gives a pretty wide set of view-points.  He criss-crosses from New York, to Washington D.C., to Berlin, and back again.  His protagonist, Patrick Mahan, is thrust into an overwhelming situation, leading a rag-tag brigade of German- and African-American troops, while finding true love.  Ludwig Weber wonders why he has come from Germany to this strange country in the service of a ruler he believes insane. TR gnashes his teeth, trots around enthusastically, while managing to hold the country together.  Kasier Wilhelm gnashes teeth, asserts his greatness, and constantly demands reassurances from his council, none of whom really are loyal to their ruler.<br />  Conroy is also suprisingly good at maintaining suspense.  We care about the characters by and large, and the fact that they could die keeps the reader on his/her toes.  More importantly, Conroy builds his suspense by rewriting history.  Initially when I began reading, I was convinced the U.S. would win.  But as the book progressed, I wasn't so sure, particularly given the one-sided quality of the events.  And regardless of who won, the ultimate consequences on the world would be amazing.<br />  Conroy does have some clunky passages, and some of his plot lines are cliched.  Not all of his characters are a well defined as they could be.  The kaiser in particular seems a little cartoony (in all fairness to Conroy, every biographical essay, text, etc. suggests that Willy had no depth). However it is a first novel, and these problems are easily overlooked.  Conroy's novel is simply entertaining and enjoyable.  It's a shame it is out of print five years after publication, as it would be an obvious book for DelRey or some other such publisher of alternate history to snap up.  I also hope Conroy continues writing books, as he does have a great deal of skill and craft that just needs to be refined.  The overall quality of &quot;1901&quot; is proof of that.	2001-01-26
US	49102989	RATXAVZ8AN0E1	0375411216	694000010	Dead and Gone: A Burke Novel (Burke Novels)	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	Return to Darkness	As a big fan of Andrew Vachss, both as a writer and as a human being, I was very pleased with the latest Burke novel, &quot;Dead and Gone.&quot;  In fact, this is easily his best novel since &quot;Footsteps of the Hawk&quot;.  While the intermediate books were very good, they were a little more light in literary content than his previous works.  That is not to say they weren't good.  Vachss is usually several times better than the average crime/mystery writer.  But they were fairly flawed.  &quot;False Allegations&quot; became essentially a treatise on abuse and false memories/allegations (which is Vachss' primary concern when writing his Burke novels, abuse of children) and came off a little flat.  Likewise, his next novels &quot;Safe House&quot; and &quot;Choice of Evil&quot;, while developing chillingly evil antagonists for Burke (particularly in &quot;Choice of Evil&quot;), were fairly by the numbers in terms of plot.  The death of Burke's girlfriend in &quot;Choice of Evil&quot; didn't have the impact it probably should have.<br />&quot;Dead and Gone&quot; however, takes Burke back into his darkest roots.  Burke is ambushed, blinded by gunfire, and a primary character who has been present throughout the series is murdered. Burke seeths for revenge, but must vanish in order to achieve it.  And the answer to that revenge may lay in Burke's violent past.<br />The characterization of Burke here is utterly frightening.  This is the Burke of &quot;Flood&quot; and &quot;Down in the Zero&quot;, the Burke who likes to share his pain with whatever monster he can get his hands on.  The streetwise, amoral predator at work.  Through his eyes, the reader is shown a world we are loathe to even acknowledge, much less see.  A world the average person cannot even begin to imagine.  Naturally Vachss, through Burke, wants us to see this world, forces us to see. It is there, and only when we all see it, Vachss tells us, can this world be destroyed.<br />Be warned, this is not the book to begin with if you are a new Vachss reader.  There is a definite connection to events of previous novels of the series, and unless a person has read the whole serious, the relevance of who the antagonist is will mean nothing.<br />Also be warned:  Vachss has an agenda.  He wants to show people a part of the world that most refuse to admit even exists.  Some people may not appreciate this full throttle initiation.  Vachss must be read.  But he should not be read without mental preparation first.	2001-01-17
US	49102989	R2UCZLCWB471O5	0345409353	228954811	Stars and Stripes in Peril (Stars & Stripes Trilogy)	Books	3	10	12	N	Y	Better than the first, but still lacking	Having read both &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; and &quot;Stars and Stripes in Peril&quot;, I must say Harry Harrison's second volume in his alternate history trilogy is certainly better than the first book. Much of what was wrong with the first book is not present in the second text, and &quot;Peril&quot; definitely has more to offer in terms of entertainmen value.  However, &quot;Peril&quot; also from many of the same flaws that plagued &quot;Forever&quot;, and is still far from perfect.<br />The valid complaints of implausibility that were aimed at &quot;Forever&quot; probably won't be directed at &quot;Peril&quot;.  Harrison pretty well established his divergence in &quot;Forever&quot;(as clumsily as that was), and &quot;Peril&quot; simply picks up in the new history that Harrison has created.  Harrison begins &quot;Peril&quot; with a brief recap of the events of &quot;Forever&quot; in the form of a &quot;memoir&quot; by General Sherman, introducing new readers as well as reminding old readers.  <br />Harrison is also very effective at keeping the action in one self-contained book.  Though it is the second book in a trilogy, there are really no dangling plotlines that a reader will be plagued by until the next book.<br />Further, Harrrison's plot is extremely entertaining overall.  Britain, still steaming over her loss in the first novel, plans to attack the U.S. through Mexico.  At the same time, the U.S. is still dealing with several unresolved issues of the brief War Between the States, as the South is forced to adjust to the emancipation of the slaves,a more low-key analog to Radical Reconstrucion in our time line.  With British invasion seemingly unavoidable, America looks to take the war to England's backyard.<br />&quot;Stars and Stripes in Peril&quot;, as stated, is an entertaining read overall, but it does suffer many of &quot;Forever's&quot; faults.  Harrison uses a third-person omniscient narrator to tell his story, which I must admit is not myfavorite means narration.  What is worse, while Harrison uses this method to further his plot at a rapid pace, he does so at the expense of characterization and effective sub-plots.  The reader is allowed briefly into the minds of nearly every character that appears int his novel.  The end result, however, is that no single character develops any actual depth, and the reader does not care one way or another who lives or who dies.<br />Another problem is Harrison's clear optimism with regards to America's relationship with the world.  In &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; America cheerfully lets Canada go on her merry way, with no expansionist intent whatsoever, flying in the face of history. In &quot;Stars and Stripes in Peril&quot; America comes into possession of what can only be called an overseas empire, and again, Harrison, despite history, has his Americans let it go.  While certainly idealistic, it just doesn't hold water.<br />Finally, though another conflict with Britain made sense for this book, Harrison certainly leads the reader to believe that the final book will feature the ultimate conflict between America and Britain.  I must say that this idea has lost a great deal of luster.  I would rather see new challenges to America's rising power in the world, rather than see yet another volume of America trounce on Britain yet again.<br />Ultimately, Harrison tells and entertaining yarn, that, much like a summer blockbuster film, gets a great deal of mileage out of a cool, larger-than-life concept. Taken in this way, it works just fine.  Taken any other way, and it begins to wither.  Still, I will read the third book when it comes out, and I am vaguely curious to see how this history could play out over time.  For all of its flaws, it is, as I said, a cool concept.	2000-12-12
