Like that book, Honeymoon Suite has wonderful characters, a delightful family and Ms. Michaels' wonderful style and wit. <br /> <br />Sadly, she couldn't make two very important points work, try as she might.   I cannot feel sorry for this family that is so poor it has to sell off the vintage Packard and the expensive art work so it can continue to live in a house \\"two football fields long and one football field wide\\".  There ARE poor people who don't have vintage cars to sell off.   Why didn't they just sell the estate, pay off the staff (yes, they still had a large staff) and get jobs? <br /> <br />Second, I can't respect a hero who tells the heroine he loves her a few hours after he married her sister.  While his wife is sleeping off too much champagne, he's making his move on the sister.  Okay so his wife didn't marry him for love, is it too much to expect him to wait for an annulment?  Why was he such a jerk he married the gorgeous sister anyway? <br /> <br />I kept thinking, I REALLY like Ms. Michaels' writing--and I do--but she plotted a pit for herself her and could never quite get me to care.	2005-09-12

He's enough to make Dr. Kelly Martin lose her professional demeanor.  But she doesn't.  She's as tough as he is and just as accustomed to getting her way.<BR>Cole is also furious.  A cop in Houston, Cole was shot.  He lost part of his lung but the worst injuries are to his hip and leg.  As he recuperates on the second floor of his parents home in a small town, he knows he'll never work homicide again and doesn't want to be a desk jockey.<br />As the attraction between the two grows, so do the obvious conflicts  Years earlier, he fled Naconiche for Houston but she loves the small town.  He was tricked into a disastrous marriage when his girlfriend said she was pregnant.  Now Kelly is pregnant and worried about telling him.  <br />The Cop is a fast, sexy read.  It is book three of Ms. Hudson's Texas Outlaws series but stands along very well--although it makes the reader want to catch up on those other brothers named for famous outlaws.<br />The talented and multi-published Jan Hudson has created a great looking and complex hero who is torn between duty, his physical problems, and his desire not to fall in love with the beautiful, loving doctor.  Kelly is just as torn.  She has her home in Naconiche and her patients who care about her.  Can she turn her back on all of this to be with the father of her baby?  How can she tell him when he's been trapped before?  But how can she not tell Cole?  How will he feel when she does?<br />Ms. Hudson brings all these conflicts together into a satisfying and happy end, a celebrations of love and family.	2004-07-19

Writers should try new styles and plots.   This one is darker and hotter than Ms. Berg's other books.<br />But this one doesn't work.  The story and the hero's background are VERY dark.   To lighten this up and add humor, Ms. Berg adds a flakey heroine who wears almost no clothing and lots of hot sex.<br />It doesn't work.  Putting fluff on top of a dark plot doesn't lighten the plot.  It's like putting whipped cream on meatloaf.  That doesn't turn it into dessert, just makes it more obvious they don't fit.  As for humor, there's very little.<br />I gave it two stars instead of one for what it could have been.	2004-07-19

There were two interesting characters:  Gena and Ollie--and they were secondary characters.  Nothing happens--girl gets pregnant, parents break couple up, they find each other at the end after a great deal of soul searching and worry and crying.  I have my doubts that an ex-con with five ex-wives was the best choice for a husband and means a happy ending.<br />I grew up in Kansas City about the same time the author did.  I enjoyed the names of familiar  roads but some of the geography was off, which threw me.  However, this is fiction, so I accept that.	2004-07-11

She's wiggling her naked bottom in front of a roomful of men to earn money.  Okay, she doesn't drop her pants completely, but I cannot admire a woman who does this.<br />The secondary female is almost naked in a V-string and little else--and she claims to be a virgin.  She may be physically but she's a tease and being a virgin does not make her a moral person.<br />As much as I wanted to like TZ (the heroine), I keep remembering the first pages about her.<br />Please understand--I am not a prude.  I don't mind a hot read or sex scenes, but I don't like my heroines shaking their naked bodies for men in exchange for money.	2004-05-31

Ms. Chamberlin is a very funny woman and a great writer with a smooth style.<br />Unfortunately, her editor let her down.  This book should be 100 pages shorter.   I skipped from March to June without any loss in continuity.  Didn't feel I missed a thing.   Then, in August, I started scanning and skipping scenes.<br />I loved the places in Boston the friends met--and I liked all the friends--but I felt at least 1/4th of those shared meals could have been cut because they didn't go anywhere.   I don't understand the need for the affair between Erin's father and Abby.  Nor was there much of a need for Maureen.  There was a LOT here that could have been cut.  This would have picked up the pace and made this a much better novel.  <br />And, sadly, the length hurt the best part of the book--Ms. Chamberlin's great voice and terrific wit.  While the ending was not sloppy, was actually very well written, by the time I fainally got there, I was worn out and Ms. Chamberlin wasn't funny anymore.  What happened to Erin's smart mouth when we needed it?<br />I'm not sure I want to spend more money for her next novel and end up skipping 1/3 of it.	2004-03-28

When the reader and hero Zane MacAllister meet her, she's weak, vulnerable and at the point of starvation.  She has no money and no future, nothing but the pitiful cabin her grandmother left her.  In spite of her appearance, Roan is not weak and doesn't want pity.  With tremendous strength of will, she has decided to turn her life around, a tough job.<BR>A talented man from a loving family, everything has always come easily to Zane--fame, fortune and women.  However, because of the one failure in his life, Roan is not the right woman for him.  Even knowing that, he can't help but admire her and, finally, fall in love with her.<br />This is not an easy story to resolve, but Ms. Brashear brings it together with great skill.  Roan O'Hara is a heroine you'll never forget;  A Real Hero is a book you'll want to reread.	2004-03-11

I've been waiting for Daisy's Back in Town for months.  <br />What a disappointment.  If this had been written by another author, one who is known for angst not humor, I might have given it more stars.  But, Rachel, if you're going to take our money, we deserve a good story in return.<br />In the second half, there were about 10-20 lines that reminded me of this terrific author's voice, but it wasn't enough to save the book.  <br />And, to the reviewer who suggested all the negative reviews are written by one person, get over it.

She has every right to strike out in a different direction but the cover of the book shouldn't be a cartoon promising a romp--not that that is Ms. Ridgway's fault.  <br />The hero and heroine begin as very interesting characters.  I loved the description of the heroine and what she was like at the beginning.  Then she changed, became dull, wandering.<br />This book almost seems like an very early effort (obviously unpublished) with a rewritten and excellent beginning and a great ending.  In between, there is a lifeless secondary plot and little resolution of the heroine's problem with her father.<br />If you want to enjoy a good read, try her other books.	2004-01-30

The hero is wonderful.  The problem is that she uses her style of interrupting introspection with cute little asides--well, you know what I mean.  She does this far too often.  Should have used a FIND and cut out at least half of them.  All her novels are beginning to sound the same and that gets old after a while--and in this one, just too much.<br />One other problem is that three of her characters have a great deal of unpleasant baggage which Ms. Bevarly handles very well.  Unfortunatley, she has to give the secondary male baggage, too.  His problem is dropped into the end of the story and completely unneccessary.  It would have been nice to have one normal person here.<br />If you haven't read Elizabeth Bevarly before, you'll enjoy this novel.  It's just when you've read her most recent ones that you notice she's not fresh anymore.	2004-01-11

I really liked the characters and the idea of this book, but I found it almost unreadable.   The story was told completely through dialogue and the PRESENT tense.  I've never read a book completely told in the present tense and now I know why.  Although the reader might think this would increase the intimacy, it doesn't.  Instead, the brain needs to slog through a tense that just doesn't work at all.<br />I've never read a book by Ms. Markham and never will again until she writes on the front that she uses past tenses.<br />Wasn't there an editor at Warner to point this difficulty out?	2003-08-02

She lost her virginity when she was 15 to a kid who promised he'd take her to the movie.   She plans to have sex with her boss who she knows takes a different secretary to his weekend meeting to have sex with her--the idea that she plans to marry him doesn't excuse her.  It makes her sound even  dumber.  Then she has the hots for the nerd in no time.<br />I also disliked her showing people from Tennessee as ignorant idiots who talk funny and have several illigitimate children because the women can't say \\"no\\".<br />Try something else by VLT--her other books are great.	2003-07-20

He was a hunk with deep problems.  She was so lacking in self-confidence that no one could find her attractive.  Then, suddenly, she's beautiful.  Her hair is shiny.  Her face is gorgeous.  Her figure is not fat--as everyone in the village thought--but tempting.  How did it happen?  <br />The Gothic background isn't interesting or mood inspiring--just crumbling and moldy and creepily unpleasant.  There are so many holes in the book it's hard to know where to begin.  The castle was destroyed by the English--nonetheless, the hero is able to find his mother's old gowns someplace which are a perfect fit for the heroine.  And the villagers leave the heroine tied at a stake for the Dragon to eat--but she still loves them.  Never expects them to ask forgiveness.  <br />But most of all, there was no magic.  When I finished this book, I decided this must have been a re-issued early novel.  It wasn't.  So I decided it must be an early novel Ms. Medeiros hadn't sold--it read that way.  Rough and uneven and boring.  But this is not true either.  It's just a not very good book.<br />Save your money on this.  Try most of her others which are, truly, wonderful and magical.	2003-05-27

There was so much back-and-forth murkiness and not funny stuff.  I looked at the ending and discovered the reason for the murder was stupid and not at all amusing.  Dirty family secrets are not funny.  I have no problem with people's sexual preferences but it made a very boring motive.

Peerless Theodesia is my favorite book of hers.  The hero and the heroine are Americans who turn the ton upside down.   This is a  marvelous book -- many thanks to Regency Press for bringing it back in this  reprise edition.	2000-05-05
US	49727149	RQYWW2TUXRJMY	0449500365	644779116	Peerless Theodosia	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A Peerless Regency	Rebecca Baldwin is one of the best and least known Regency authors, and Peerless Theodosia is one of her most enjoyable romps.  Theodosia is completely believable as an unsual Regency heroine -- an American miss with  ideas of her own.  Of course, Theodosia does find love at the end of this  novel<br />All the characters are individuals who survive their visitors and  discover they are better off because they knew the peerless  Theodosia.<br />This reprise novel by Regency Press will delight all Regency  readers and should draw many new fans.<br />Jane Myers Perrine	2000-04-09
