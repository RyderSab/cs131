Lucy  admires George, but commits to marry Cecil. She rejects Cecil because she adopts George's assessment of Cecil's character. She will not marry George the Truthful because he does not fit Cecil's standard of propriety (though the author does not quite tell us that). She is indecisive and is making everyone miserable, when finally some odd man with absurd philosophies pushes her to make a decision which, our author tries to convince us, was the correct one. Here is the message: It is perfectly fine to lie to everyone. After you have dodged them, hurt them, and confused them,  \\"it will all come right in the end\\" and you will live happily ever after. The message appeals well to an age of utter selfishness. Our heroine shows some sign of repentance: He will never forgive us. But she immediately takes it back: I mean, he will never be interested in us again. But the selfish character wins and the reader is to applaud her \\"courage.\\"	2005-03-08

Calvinism's Misrepresentation of God	Books	1	33	63	N	N	Erroneous Assertions	Having read St. Augustine's City of God, John Calvin's Institutes, Martin Luther's The Bondage of the Will, and  having just finished my tenth reading of the entire Bible, I am convinced that Hunt misses the meaning of God's love. This is a book not about God's love, but about man's gloriousness. It would fit well among the writings of the Age of Enlightenment, except for its bad scholarship. Particulars about the author's misinterpretation of the above books abound in reviews by other sensible readers, so I shall spare you... Readers who give this book more than one star fascinate me. My conclusion is that they have read neither the Bible (unless they have read it in their sleep) nor the works of the theological giants mentioned above.  For that they are to be grievously pitied.	2003-10-01

It is the story of a prince who is anxious to keep his throne no matter what the cost. This obsession leads him to bring misery to several key characters. A supernatural force fights against him, but he refuses to acknowledge it. A bleeding statue, a giant helmet, and much vengeance from the haunting knight makes the reader wonder when the prince would give in. The interactions between some characters are beautiful and noble. For someone who likes knights in armors, castles and fortresses, virtuous ladies, and many more gothic themes, this book is a wonderful choice.	2003-04-07

The author argues for the Christian's liberty to read fiction, to listen to good music, or to engage in scientific research without feeling guilty that his activities are &quot;purely secular&quot; and that God's time is too valuable to be &quot;wasted&quot; on such things. Prudent participation in culture is both a duty and a pleasure. It helps God's children to see Him as the Creator of everything that is beautiful and brilliant and to be able to say with J.S. Bach: SDG (Soli Deo Gloria)! The author does a wonderful job supporting his conclusions Biblically.	2003-02-06

He has been to these places, participated in their activities, and spoken to individuals from opposing sides. He is funny (though sometimes too vulgar for some people's taste) and his humor is not bitter. Though the reader may be unfamiliar with some of the names of people and events in history O'Rourke uses to illustrate things, the author is still able to make his points. His writing style with rich vocabulary is refreshing in a time when political writings read like children's essays. Overall, a very educational read.	2003-02-06

The author's criticism of Harry Potter makes it sound like he has never read the Bible. Perhaps, like most modern legalistic evangelicals, he is reading his Bible as a book of moral code instead of the HOLY God's redemeptive plan of SINFUL humans. It seems to me that the same criticisms of the story's content (violent) and characters (imperfect) could easily apply to Biblical history as well. I wonder if the author would be bothered by Biblical scenes with children being dashed against rocks, men's eyes being gouged out, and women eating their own children. Perhaps he would be deeply disturbed by Abraham's and David's lies and Samson's vengeful prayer to destoy the pagan temple with himself in it. The Harry Potter books do not advocate the idea of the end justifying the means. Harry Potter finds himself in tremendously fearful predicaments as a result of his lies. Even if he does not suffer any consequences, not all Bible liers suffer worldly consequences. Remember Rahab the prostitute? God is gracious to His people and He commands His people to be gracious and forgiving. But Mr. Abanes sees this as a problem. He fails to see that if God punished us for every sin, Mr. Abanes himself would not be alive to write his book! As for the occult, I can answer our author thus: \\"To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted\\" (Titus 1:15). A Christian should feel safe reading anything because his new nature will cause him to recoil when the material is not pleasing to his God. He can be informed and entertained, but not engaged in any magic or divination--not that these stories are inviting anyone to engage in them. If Mr. Abanes did not join the occult after reading all of the Harry Potter books published, then neither will God's other children.	2002-12-03

Night and day I pondered until ... I grasped the truth that the righteousness of God is that righteousness whereby, through grace and sheer mercy, he justifies us by faith. Thereupon I felt myself to be reborn and to have gone through open doors into paradise. The whole of Scripture took on a new meaning, and whereas before 'the righteousness of God' had filled me with hate, now it became to me inexpressibly sweet in greater love.

The villain can usually be counted on to confine the heroine in the haunted wing of a castle because she refuses to marry someone she hates.

On oft-repeated midnight prowls about the gloomy passageways of a rambling, ruined castle, the heroine in a quiver of excitement (largely self-induced) experiences a series of hair-raising adventures and narrow escapes.
