This one is exceptionally well plotted and written.The two main plots and various subplots, while at first disparate, are neatly interwoven by the author leading to a chilling denouement. Edgar Allan Poe looms large in this novel.The discovery of the skeleton of a woman entombed behind a brick wall in a house Poe lived in a century before sets Alex Cooper and her colleagues Mercer and Mike off on a chase through sites in New York which I have never encountered in other novels. Meanwhile they are also trying to solve the case of the reappearance of the Silk Stocking Rapist in New York's Upper East Side and a murder apparently committed by this rapist. Ultimately the cases turn out to be linked and are solved with great ingenuity by Alex and her colleagues.	2005-09-25

Like Clive Cussler he uses co-authors to spin out yarns under his name. At least they are given credit, unlike some others. Lifeguard is one of the better recent Patterson novels. The plot is well summarized in another review here. No point in repeating it. There are more twists and turns in this novel than on a rollercoaster. Ned Kelly is taken for quite a ride. He loses one gorgeous babe to murder but ends up sunning with former FBI agent at the story ends.	2005-09-25

If you like this series, then you'll probably like this novel. But you can do much better. The characters are wooden, the dialogue stilted and Stone's exploits are outlandish. Woods has adopted James Patterson's style of short chapters but unlike Patterson he doesn't pull it off. I just read Lifeguard by Patterson. While it is not great literature it delivers exactly what it promises and is a highly entertaining read. Sadly, the same cannot be said for this novel by Woods.

I read the first, Do or Die, just recently. After reading this fourth in the series I'll definitely have to go back and read the other two. I eagerly await the fifth. <br />The plot and character development in this novel are exceptional. What appears at first to be an accidental death or at most a suicide as a man falls or is pushed from an abandoned church balcony in the small Ottawa Valley town of ashford Landing turns out to be murder. But who has been murdered and who the murderer is are not immediately apparent. Tenacious Inspector Green pursues scanty leads to uncover a secret that a family has kept hidden for twenty years but at great cost to siblings and parents. Great reading! <br />	2005-09-25

The chief character in this novel, Billy Wiles, a bartender in a local pub in the region where he grew up,finds a note on his windshield as he's leaving one night which propels him onto a path of no-win choices with horrible consequences. He faces choices devised by a twisted mind, choices no human should face, let alone Billy who has already had more than his share of tragedy in his life.

His name continues to sell novels penned under the Covert One franchise but they do not live up to Ludlum's work. Nonetheless, this latest Covert One tale featuring Dr. Jon Smith, a medical James Bond, is entertaining and worth a read. A Russian President, who closely resembles Vladimir Putin, sets out to reclaim former components of the Soviet Union. As he masses his armies on their borders, he is able to kill off key leaders and key intelligence analysts using DNA weapons individually tailored to each victim. He is assisted in this venture by a former GDR bioweapons researcher. Jon Smith dashes around Europe attempting to head off impending disaster and in the end succeeds.

It appears that Ivanov has committed suicide and even Renko believes that for most of the novel. But why? A search for the answer takes Renko to the Exclusion Zone around Chernobyl where sanctioned workers and unsanctioned residents live a surreal existence. At this point the novel loses its way and meanders into an examination of the meaning of life. Eventually Renko untangles the relationship of one of the key characters in the second half of the novel to the dead men in the first half but only after you wonder whether he will emerge from the wasteland around Chernobyl.

I found Hour Game less satisfying than its predecessor, Split Second. Baldacci has created an intiguing novel about a serial killer who is killing victims in a manner which replicates the methods of a whole series of serial murderers. Interwoven with this are the complex interpersonal dynamics of a wealthy and dysfunctional Southern family, the Battles. To complicate matters further the author introduces a second murderer who appears to be replicating the work of the first. <br /> <br />Former Secret Service agents Sean King and Michelle Maxwell have their hands full as they assist the police in trying to track down the killer. The interplay between their characters adds to the flavour of the novel but romance has not yet blossomed. They have their hands full in trying to avert more murders but they rise to the challenge. <br /> <br />Baldacci has adopted the James Patterson technique of short chapters but it does not seem well suited to this long and complex novel. This time the identity of the villain became clear to me well before the end, largely because the other likely villains had already been killed off. In that respect the author might have been wise to muddy the waters by keeping alive some other viable suspects. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-25

While the novel is fiction, it is based on a true incident, the crash of TWA 800 off Long Island in July 1996 killing 230 people. <br /> <br />The opening scenes of the novel find an adulterous couple cavorting on a sandy beach on Long Island, videotaping themselves having sex. They witness the explosion of TWA 800 and inadvertently capture the incident on tape. Next we witness the fifth anniversary of the crash which ex-homocide detective John Corey attends with his young wife, FBI agent Kate Mayfield.She suggests to him that she has lingering doubts about the cause of the crash and encourages him to pursue an independent investigation.  <br /> <br />Corey is a maverick. Most of the novel is taken up with his stirring of the evidence and, in particular, pursuit of the couple suspected to have been on the beach that night. This results in him and Kate being banished to Yemen and Africa respectively. Upon his return Corey takes up the pursuit and locates the lady involved. He secures her copy of the videotape which clearly shows a missile en route to TWA 800. He decides to burst an apparent conspiracy of silence wide open and sets up a meeting at the posh restaurant near the top of the twin Towers of the World Trade Centre. It is 9 AM on September 11, 2001..... <br /> <br />I enjoyed this novel. If I have one beef it is with the contrived ending which was apparently suggested by the author's son. It lets the author off the hook from exposing who was supposedly behind the conspiracy re TWA 800. <br /> <br />The best Nelson DeMille novel I have read is Up Country, which features a former military detective returning to Vietnam twenty years after the end of the war to solve a case involving top American military personnel. It's a fascinating read.	2005-01-22

This novel, featuring detective Petra Connor who starred in a couple of previous novels, ranks among his better yarns. <br /> <br />Two main plots underpin the story. One involves the shooting of several teenagers on the parking lot of Club Paradiso on Sunset Boulevard, one of whom remains unidentified. The second plot involves the discovery by boy genius Isaac Gomez,a Ph.D. student interning at the police station where Petra is based, of six murders on June 28 of different years by a hard blow to the base of the skull.The victims come from diverse backgrounds and appear unrelated. <br /> <br />Petra tracks down the culprits in the Paradiso shootings but is suspended because she didn't play by the rules and leave the apprehension to the downtown LA gangbuster task force. While suspended, Petra continues to pursue the idea that a serial killer is at work in the June 28 killings. Meanwhile Isaac becomes involved with a middle-aged librarian who comes up with a key to the mystery in an old book. This reinforces Petra's view as to the likely suspect being the husband of the first known victim. While she and her partner Eric stakeout the suspect, Isaac boots up his computer and realizes that they have missed an important clue. Singlehandedly, he apprehends the killer and catches himself a beautiful girlfriend in the process. <br /> <br />I would like to see more adventures featuring Isaac but I alsso miss Alex and hope to see him again soon.	2005-01-22

I will not summarize the plot as it is captured well elsewhere here. Follett deftly weaves a tale of attempted bioterrorism, set in Scotland in winter at Xmastime. The action takes place in a biotechnology lab and in the family estate of the scientist/owner, Stanley Oxenford. A gang of thieves have commandeered the services of Stanley's son, Kit, who owes a lot of gambling debts to the local mobster. Arrayed against them is Toni Gallo, head of security at the lab and ex-police. Follett paints a revealing portrait of sibling rivalry and family interpersonal dynamics in the extended Oldenford clan. As the plot unfolds, the family and the villains end up snowbound with a deadly virus at the family estate. Various members of the family, including 16-year-old Craig,engage in various initiatives to thwart the thieves. But eventually Toni, who has fallen in love with Stanley,foils their attempt to sell the virus to their terrorist buyer. <br />Follett's writing style grips you by the throat and carries you along turning the pages and burning the midnight oil until you reach the end and close the book with a sigh of satisfaction. <br /> <br />With sixteen novels to his credit, Follett remains one of the best thriller writers around.	2005-01-20

A great read	In this bestseller by Michael Crichton you are taken on a rollercoaster ride around the world as MIT Professor John Kenner, allied with philantropist George Morton and lawyer Peter Evans, strives to avert a series of environmental disasters contrived and executed by environmentalists intent on \\"proving\\" that global warming is real and abrupt catastrophic climate change is imminent. To enjoy this book you should forget your views about whether or not global warming is a threat and just go along for the ride. <br /> <br />This is another well-written novel by Crichton, crammed with facts and arguments about the validity of global warming as an environmental threat. Crichton portrays environmentalists as villains who will go to any length to engender support for their cause. A very ironic twist is that the final environmental disaster that the villains are plotting is a landslide in the South Pacific to trigger a tsunami to sweep the western seaboard of the U.S. As I read this novel in the days following the tragic Indian Ocean tsunami of Boxing Day 2004, I found this element of the plot a little too close for comfort. <br /> <br />Crichton is out to disembowel the concept of global warming but you can enjoy this novel without accepting his premise or arguments.	2005-01-20

There are two major plot streams. One involves the discovery of an iridium meteorite in Greenland in a shrine built by Eric the Red and subsequent attempts by a vengeful American industrialist Halifax Hickman to use it to replace Abraham's Stone in Mecca and help bring about the destruction of three sites sacred to Islam. The other involves the theft of a tactical nuclear warhead from the Ukraine and an attempt by a radical Islamic  group to destroy the heart of London on New Year's Eve. The schemes intersect in the first part of the novel but Juan Cabrillo and The Corporation (mercenaries with a conscience)track down the would-be perpetrators of a London massacre and avert disaster. Tracking down the meteorite and divining the identity and intentions of Mr. Hickman, and preventing the destruction of Islam's three holy sites, prove more challenging. But with a lot of luck and much ingenuity Juan Cabrillo and his team thwart the attempt to destroy the foundations of Islam.	2005-01-03

Tami Hoag has crafted a roller-coaster crime thriller with well-developed characters and a fastpaced plot. The messenger of the title is J.C.(Jace)Damon, a bike courier who is finishing the last drop of the day when someone comes very close to killing him. Jace has a package of negatives which someone badly wants. He spends the rest of the novel on the run, trying to protect his younger brother Tyler, aided and abetted by the Chen family in Chinatown where he had taken refuge from Children Protective services when his mother died. <br /> <br />Also in pursuit of Jace are some dysfunctional LAPD detectives including Kev Parker who was bumped down in rank after an earlier case of his went up in smoke during trial, embarrassing the ADA who now has it in for Kev. A couple of other high profile detectives want to take Kev's case from him and Internal Affairs is hot on his trail. <br /> <br />The plot takes a number of interesting twists. I dare you to figure out the villain who is being backmailed until the the author reveals the identity in a shootout in the last few pages. In fact, if I have one complaint about this novel, it is that the villain comes as too much of a surprise. Given the story up to that point,the ending seems a bit incongruent with the rest of the plot but Hoag does a good job of making it seem plausible. All in all, an excellent book.	2004-11-29

Yet it retains many of the elements which have made Deaver's novels bestsellers. <br /> <br />Paul Schumann, gangster hitman, is caught by the authorities in New York but, instead of being carted off to jail, he is given a choice- go to jail and face execution or go to Berlin and assassinate one of Hitler's top henchmen, the mythical Reinhard Ernst, who is in charge of Germany's illegal rearmament effort. If he performs this task, he will be freed and given money to set himself up in a legitimate printing business. <br /> <br />So it's off to Berlin for Schumann under the guise of a sportswriter covering the Olympic games. But, as he is about to meet his contact, Schumann stumbles upon a murder which sets the delightful Willi Kohl of the Kripo on his trail. As Schumann hunts his prey, he too is hunted over a feverish 48 hours in Berlin. We come to meet Hitler, Goering, Himmler , Goebels and other historical figures who masterminded the evil of the Third Reich. <br /> <br />The novel is also populated by characters such as Otto Webber, a conman who is of great assistance to Schumann in his endeavour, and Kathe Richter,a schoolteacher who has been forced out of her job for teaching Goethe and with whom Schumann falls in love. The plot twists and twists in many directions and the ending is unexpected. In the end Willi Kohl and Paul Schumann both put the lives of others ahead of their self-interest. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-11-25

Following the horror of September 11th, Kurt Kurtovic, who is living peacefully in the midwest town of Westfield with his wife and daughter, receives a visit from government agents who question his past. This motivates him to set forth to infiltrate Al Quaeda and attempt to forestall further attacks that he senses are imminent. <br /> <br />On a journey that takes him to Britain, Spain, Africa and imprisonment in Guatanamo Bay, Kurtovic uncovers and kills a major Al Quaeda leader, discovers that a series of further attacks are underway using ships with dirty bombs, and is left dangling by unknown American handlers. Ultimately he is freed to return to Westfield where he is reunited with his wife and daughter who have been under Agency protection. But he has a secret, a biological weapon which he has retained from his pre-September 11th exploits. This he destroys. Shadowy figures kidnap his daughter and demand he produce the secret weapon. Together he and his wife manage to outwit and outfight them. Ultimately the trail leads back to the Sleeper, an underground figure in America with friends in high places, who is manipulating many of the players in this tale of evil. <br /> <br />	2004-11-20

Then along comes \\"The Plot against America\\" and knocks my socks off!Roth has created a fictional account of an alternate reality to the events of 1940-1942 in America. In his bid for a third term as President, Franklin Roosevelt is upset by Charles Lindbergh of The-Spirit-of-St.-Louis fame. The famous and beloved aviator, although running under the Republican banner, is really a candidate for the America First movement, pledging to keep America out of the Second World War. After assuming office, he signs non-aggression pacts with Germany and Japan. <br /> <br />The story is told by Philip Roth, ages 7 to 9, who lives in Newark with his parents Herman and Bess in the midst of predominantly a Jewish community. Fear permeates the novel, fear of an anti-Semitic pogrom by those who have assumed power and by a large number of their fellow Americans. The creation by Lindbergh of an Office of American Absorption which sends, for example, Philip's brother, Sandy, to spend the summer on a farm in Kentucky, is the thin edge of a wedge which culminates in the assassination of Walter Winchell in his quixotic bid to unseat Lindbergh, and the unleashing of anti-Semitic riots across America. Death and confusion reign triumphant briefly.  Lindberg disappears mysteriously on one of his solo flights across America, the Vice-President assumes power and imposes martial law. Then Roth pulls a rabbit out of his hat and, with the assistance of Anne Morrow Lindbergh, the tyrants are held at bay, a special Presidential election is held in 1942 and Roosevelt returns to power just in time to take America into the Second World War after the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbour. <br /> <br />This an extremely well-written novel, one of the best I've read in years. Some will quibble with Roth's use of Lindberg as a villain but it is well-established that he was a Nazi sympathizer. In any event the novel is not about Lindberg but rather about what canhappen in a democracy with a certain congruence of circumstances and people. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this novel	2004-11-15

Seeing that it was ranked 60th on the Modern library list for the 20th century, I had high expectations. <br /> <br />I struggled through the first 50-60 pages and almost set it aside. To put it mildly, I was bored. But I persevered and finished it. This novel has minimal plot and characters that you do not come to love. Binx Bolling,age 29, is wandering though life in a pre-midlife crisis. He has a respectable job(a broker) with a reasonable income but he lacks a purpose. He goes to movies for pleasure and seduces his secretaries.  <br /> <br />The setting is interesting-New Orleans in the 1950s. The whole novel takes place over a few days around the Mardi Gras. Binx suffers from malaise. His cousin Kate exhibits bouts of mania and melancholy and would no doubt now be considered to be a manic-depressive. She is suicidal. She lost her financee in an automobile accident some time before the novel begins. She and Binx have a curious relationship which culminates in sex in the latter portion of the novel.  <br /> <br />Just as it seems that Binx is breaking out of malaise and his detached-observer status, Binx answers a summons by his patron, Aunt Emily, and returns hastily to New Orleans where he is given a good lecture by the aunt. He decided to marry Kate so as to help manage her moods and , after having resisted his aunt's entreaties for years to study for a profession, Binx yields and heads off to medical school. <br /> <br />The only characters who elicit some empathy are Binx's mother and his half-brother and-sisters. They live a lowerclass but seemingly more real life style.  <br /> <br />The driving force behind this book is existentialism. As one of my colleagues put it, it is Camus Lite. Walker Percy lost both his grandfather and father to suicide, and his mother in an automobile accident. He trained as a doctor, became ill with tuberculosis, did a pschyoanalytic residency and became enamoured with several existentialist philosophers. Elements of all these influences infuse this novel. <br /> <br />Do I reget reading this novel? No. Would I read it again? No.	2004-11-12

It has a good plot involving corruption in the NYPD and the Catholic church, good villains in Kane, the aspiring Mayor of New York, and corrupt cops and priests who are beholden to him. New York District Attorney Butch Karp and his wife Marlene have a complicated relationship. For much of the novel Marlene and their daughter are off at a retreat in New Mexico attempting to chase away the \\"demons\\" that haunt them. There they become embroiled in the search for missing Navaho kids who turn up murdered. This subplot is linked back to murdered children in New York, some found with rosaries tossed on their bodies before they were buried. The novel starts with the murder of a LA rapper in a New York club which is initially attributed to another young rapper who had done prison time previously. As the plot unfolds, Butch Karp comes to realize that things are not what they seem. The accused young rapper possesses secret files on police and priest crimes and coverups which threaten the church hierarchy and the campaign of mayoralty candidate Kane.

This book is interesting but it would have benefitted from a good edit to cut out some of the boring parts. Some have compared it to The Da Vinci Code. Frankly, it is not in the same league.  <br /> <br />The two friends Paul and Tom, who are involved in deciphering the codes embedded in the 500-year-old the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, are likeable characters. You get interested in their story but then the plot meanders for a while before coming back on track. In many ways the book has all the right ingredients but the authors are not yet quite adept at putting them together.  <br /> <br />I look forward to their next novel to see whether they can improve on this good first effort.	2004-10-17

It is also a paen to the disappearing art of letterwriting. The book is a selection of correspondence between Helene Hanff in New York and Frank Doel, a bookseller in London. The correspondence spans 20 years from Helene's first request for books in 1949 to Frank's death in 1969. The correspondence rapidly changes from the formal to that between kindred souls who love books and ultimately extends to Frank's coworkers and family. Unfortunately Helene never made it to London to visit the bookstore until after Frank's death.

From the beginning, this series has been lightweight stuff, suitable for a pleasant quick read and easy to forget. I found \\"McNally's Bluff\\" the lightest of the series so far. Archie McNally is back as Palm Beach PI to the rich and famous. Still ensconced in a tiny office in his father's law firm, Archie is the man about town always surrounded by some beautiful woman or two. His long-time squeeze, Consuela, has taken up with a dashing Cuban expatriate. Archie's newest love, Georgie, is a Florida state trooper who played a more prominent role in the previous novel. <br /> <br />The plot this time revolves around Matthew Hayes, a former carnival operator and his sidekick and wife, Marlena Marvel. Ms Marvel is quickly disposed of at the opening gala to celebrate the new arrivals to Palm Beach and their amazing maze. How her body came to be in the center of the maze moments after the guests have been taipsing through it, and who killed her, is the puzzle Archie is hired to solve by Matthew Hayes. Although suspicion is cast on several characters, the villain is fairly clear from the start. <br /> <br />The McNally novels have been fluffy from the start.

Recently he seemed to be churning out long, turgid, poorly written novels that were only a shadow of his early Dirk Pitt days,e.g.The Golden Buddha.Many of his recent co-authored books display only a vistige of vintage Cussler. <br /> <br />But not \\"Lost City\\" ! \\"Lost City\\" has an excellent plot, the writing is taut. It kept me up late turning the pages to get to the next surprise. The villains, a French family of arms merchants, have got their hands on an enzyme from the Lost City area of the mid-Atlantic Ridge of hydrothermal vents. Some of their experiments with human subjects have gone awry. Scientists who worked on the project die suddenly of apparent heart attacks or accidents. One, who tries to hide in a Greek monastery, is captured and brought back to perfect the enzyme. <br /> <br />This is interwoven with the discovery of the body of a French aviator in an Alps glacier. Kurt Austin of NUMA just happens to be working nearby exploring a mountain lake in a submersible. As the villains try to sabotage the glacier project, Austin becomes involved and the race is on. <br /> <br />For Dirk Pitt afficionados, in this book Admiral Sandecker of NUMA has become Vice President of the U.S. and Dirk Pitt is now Head of NUMA. However, this is only mentioned in passing. They play no real role in this novel. <br /> <br />After several disappointing reads, Cussler seems to be back in control and hits his stride again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-26
