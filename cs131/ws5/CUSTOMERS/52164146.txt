At first, I was wary of this book-- my problem with Orson Scott Card is that he can't finish a series-- Children of the mind was horriffic, as was xenocide- so I was a bit nervous when I picked up The Crystal City. This book however, is a strong addition (and end?) to the Alvin Maker series-- by far, his best series (as a whole) to date. It ties up many loose ends, and ends on a positive note. As always, Card's writing sucks you into his world-- i couldn't put this book down. Some minor problems: <br />1. It's a pretty good stand-alone book, but there are some parts where the reader might get confused if they have not read the other books in the Alvin Maker series (read them!)<br />2. Alvin Maker's archnemesis-- the Unmaker, seemed not much more than an afterthought-- there are few worthy enemies in this story, (and not as much conflict) which sorely disappointed me. Mr. Card's forte is his character studies, and the book falls short in this area<br />3. There was no real resolution-- the book ends on a happy note, which is odd, given how many times disaster is foretold throughout the story. <br />my only hope is thus that the ending was left open because he plans to write another book in the series-- if not, it is a disappointing ending.	2004-01-14

Those are all true of &quot;Dead Aim&quot; as well. The only problem is that the plot is completely unbelievable. <br />The protagonist, Robert Mallon finds himself being hunted by an unknown assailant after delving into the life of a woman who he has unsucessfully tried to stop from killing herself. This sounds like a fantastic plot device, but instead of developing the character and flushing out his conflicts, Perry falls short-- the last 300 pages are reminiscent of a video game, with Mallon killing anything that gets in his way. The ending is predictable, though completely unbelievable were this in reality. <br />If you're a Thomas Perry fan, or if you have a very good suspension of disbelief mechanism, then you should definitely read this book-- it's a fun read.	2003-06-10

So I actually like schlocky pleasure books. And this is one of those. It is a book award winner? certainly not. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is quite predictable-- <br />Honor Harrington (the main character of this book, and the following series) is essentially hung out to dry by her superior officers by being placed in this no-man's land corner of space. she surprises everyone by actually suceeding in the task she was set to do. Of course, it goes way deeper than that, and she's forced into a dangerous engame. (you will not be shocked by the ending)<br />I enjoyed it, however.

Kidd's imagery of the rural south in the mid-sixties is so vivid, that at times I felt taken out of the subway and transplanted on the Boatwright sisters' property with the rare gift of being an observer in this young woman's coming of age story.<br />But to chalk up this book in terms of such a cliche'd sencence seems unfair-- yes this book is a coming of age story, but it is so much more and my writing is insufficient to describe the feelings evoked while reading this book. It's a coming of age story about as much as it is a civil-rights story, or a story of love-- in many different ways. Kidd touches upon so many issues with a candor that is unusual in writers. Ultimately, however, this novel is about forgiveness and redemption-- and how a little unloved, motherless girl finds everything she's looking for on a small bee farm in Tiburon, South Carolina.<br />I like to measure how engaging a book is by the number of stops I miss on my way home on the subway. I went six stops in the wrong direction before I looked up from this book. You won't want to put it down either.	2003-03-21

Too often have I found myself in the midst of a medicre, boring plot. Not so with \\"No Way to Treat a First Lady\\". The combination Political Satire/Thriller is not only laugh out loud funny, but goes far deeper than what's on the page. <br />Buckley exploits our deep-seated cynicism for today's political leaders with a character base that is at once seriously funny and strangely familiar-- from the lecherous president to the assertive first lady (dubbed Lady Bethmac), to the lovably seedy lawyer, Boyce Baylor. <br />Not only is this novel funny, but engaging; once started, it is difficult to put down.

Mr. James is not a classicist or a philosopher (he doesn't even know the origin of the word Philosophia, which he says is Egyptian instead of Greek!)and he can't bring something new to the discipline, so he set down to write a fictional account about the Greeks stealing Egyptian philosophy. It would be dumb for anyone not to think that the Greeks were somehow influenced by the Egyptians (and the Egyptians, of course, were influenced by the Sumerians) in the archaic art and architecture, but the Egyptians offered nothing to the Greeks in the field of philosophy. The Egyptians were emersed in mysticism and religion, not in scientific inquiery. If the Egyptians were supposedly so smart and philosophic, why didn't they write down their ideas? Answer: Because they didn't have philosophy in the sense we know it. Philosophy means &quot;love of wisdom&quot; and it was a Greek creation. I suggest to the readers of this book to read the Cambridge History of Greek Philosophy and Bruce Thornton's The Greek Ways: How the Greeks created Western Civilization.

The novel takes place almost entirely within the confines of the Ukraine, and his story, rumored to be semi-autobiographical, is told through the eyes of two young and very different men. <br />The first of these is Alex, a young Ukranian boy is hired by his grandfather to be an interpreter for Jonathan, an American-- who has come seeking a woman inextricably linked to his family. What emerges is a novel that is both witty and heartbreaking at times. These characters are not only realistic, but multi-dimentional, as the author exposes their deepest insecurities and fears.  <br />Safran Foyer has not only found his voice with this novel, but he has created a voice for his characters as well.	2002-09-27

Understandaby, I was very skeptical about this trilogy at first; 'Dust' being the key to all truth? Daemons? But to my surprise, I picked up \\"The Golden Compass\\" and finished it within a few hours,  and promptly did the same with the subsequent two books. The Fantasy is first rate, the characters are well-developed and the read is fun and fast. It's very enjoyable save a few problems. <br />1. It takes awhile to get into the series. This isn't always a bad thing: take Lord of the Rings, for instance. However, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy is not only an amazing fantastical epic, but do well as individual stand-alone novels. the \\"His Dark Materials\\" Trilogy works quite well- as an epic trilogy, but the second novel follows the first so closely, that I got the impression that the subsequent two books would be very difficult to understand as stand-alone novels. <br />2. The author pulls you into his world immediately. Some authors do an incredible job with this (Tolkien, for example). But in this case, it's just confusing. He doesn't explain the little nuances of his universe until much later in the novel; I found myself wanting to go back and reread the first book just for clarification's sake. <br />3. It's not entirely clear who the bad/good guys are. This is not really a complaint; actually I quite enjoyed this aspect of the books. But for someone who is looking for an easy, uncomplicated read, this trilogy requires way too much concentration. <br />So...if you're looking for something to read that you don't have to think about, do not pick up this series. But if youre looking for a series with a highly detailed Universe (s), and one that goes into great depth and requires a much higher level of concentration than most pleasure novels, this is a great trilogy to read.	2002-05-29

Chemistry was never my favorite subject. Nor was the Holocaust. Yet Levi manages to bring these two seemingly unrelated topics together in a novel that I can only begin to hope I fully understand some day. <br />The title \\"The Periodic Table'\\" is both a misnomer, and extremely appropriate for the book. Divided into chapters, each of which are titled as the name of a different element, Levi uses the Periodic table as a grounding point for his essays, and each element as a grounding point within the chapter. The coldness of iron, the smell of sulfur, and the journey that a molecule of carbon takes. Levi, whose formal training was as a chemist, relates these simple atoms to a much more complicated--and tragic picture. <br />This book knocked my socks off. The strength of this work lies not within his description of the Holocaust; he acknowledges that he already dealt with that in his work, \\"Survival in Auschwitz\\"; but in the simplicity by which he portrays such a complicated time.	2002-05-17

US	52164146	R3KOGXRR8ZAH34	0345427637	327814320	The Angel of Darkness	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Excellent Thriller	Caleb Carr finds his voice for \\"The Angel of Darkness\\" through the eyes of the reformed street urchin, Stevie Taggert. The backdrop of this story takes place in a gang-ridden neighborhood in lower Manhattan; with the threat of war against Spain looming in the distance. Stevie tells the story in a flashback-- roughly a year after \\"The Alienist\\" took place. <br />The cast of characters is familiar to anyone who's read \\"The Alienist\\", although Carr gives sufficient background in this novel as well; first time Carr readers should not be confused by the large team of characters who work together in attempting to catch Libby Hatch, a woman accused of stealing another's baby. <br />What starts out as a simple diplomatic incident quickly grows into a monster-- one gets the feeling that one kidnapped baby really is 'the tip of the iceberg'. What follows is a classic cat-and mouse chase that leads Dr. Lazlo Kreizler (alienist and child psychologist) and his team all over the state of New York. What results is a unique perspective on criminals, and the damage (both psychological and physical) that she inflicts on individuals, and entire towns. <br />Carr is an excellent and versatile writer. He demonstrates here that he can write as an uneducated street rat just as well as he can a well-bred doctor, which he does in \\"The Alienist\\". He, much like Toni Morrison, finds his voice within the characters of his story. The story itself is fascinating from many different perspectives;  albeit a bit long. <br />The author tends to get caught up in side stories- which makes the read a whopping 630 pages. However, the tangents that Carr occasionally follows are a tantalizing glimpse into the lives and psyche of the characters.<br />I was disappointed with the side-story of the Spanish-American situation of the time-- he introduces these tensions at the beginning of the novel, and we think that it must thus be very important to the plot of the book-- which it is not. Instead, Carr puts this aspect of the book away without addressing it until the last few pages, and then only uses it to preach to the reader about how arrogant the Spanish have become. In my opinion, the book would have been much better had he placed less emphasis on this almost inconsequential part of the story.	2002-05-06

Through this backdrop Russell tells the tragic story of two civilizations that tried to help one another and wound up destroying each other instead.	2002-05-02

He and his wife Pat Shipman have taken many literary ventures together; this one being their best. <br />The challenge in popular scientific books is to make potentially dense material easy to read so that the reader doesn't feel burdened by the material he or she reads. Walker and Shipman do this very well in \\"Wisdom of the Bones\\".  Walker successfully integrates two stories here- one of his trip to Kenya leading up to his team's revolutionary discovery of Turkana Boy (Homo erectus/ ergaster), and the other of Turkana Boy and his bretherin. <br />The book doubles as a pleasurable novel and a factually saturated work-- I've found this book an invaluable resource in many classes, but i've also enjoyed the plot line. Walker keeps one engaged throughout the book-- not an easy feat in the scientific world.	2002-05-02

Clarke is not only a science fiction genius, but can actually end a series well-- a feat I have rarely seen done. This series keeps you guessing until the very end.
