Each of these three women, Suzette, Philomene, and Emily have a unique story to tell, as they all made it through life in different ways.  Each of these women is strong-willed and determined to make life easier for their families through each generation.  However, this story could not have been told if not for the woman who this family came from, Elisabeth.  Elisabeth is the glue that holds them all together.<br /><br />The story starts with Elizabeth raising Suzette, and Suzette's tale of survival.  Suzette was more submissive and did not like to cause any problems, as she always did what was told, and nothing less.  Next, Suzette gives birth to Philomene, the strong-willed, straight forward one, who always stood up for what she believed.  Philomene was very clever, and used her psychic abilities to help get her and her family ahead in life.  Philomene's story is told, as she then gives birth to Emily.  Emily's life is only a little easier, as she is the first in her family to read and write, and has the lightest skin.  Each of these women endured hardships as women of color did back in those times, but it is very interesting how each one of them overcame these obstacles in unique ways.<br /><br />Cane River is informative, dramatic, as well as entertaining.<br /><br />You will have to read to find out more.  I highly recommend this book to be added to any collection!	2005-02-28

It really opens your eyes to the issues that one must deal with while living with HIV.  It's not preachy, but yet sends across a message about many other things such as love, abuse, alcoholism, drugs, and violence.  Ava is the main character who is HIV positive, and she is the narrator of the story.  You can't help but empathize with this character.  Joyce, her older sister, is just as enjoyable.  The love and support between these two sisters is astounding.  Their relationship epitomizes how sisters should stick together.  What I really liked about this story is that the author leaves the message that love is always possible, not matter what the circumstances are.  This is my first read by Pearl Cleage, and I plan to read the sequel, I Wish I Had a Red Dress, which tells the story of Joyce.	2004-07-25

There were several characters other than the main character Matriece, and the late mother who is the opening narrator, Hosanna.  Each and every character is well-developed.  The author does a good job of making sure that the reader understands the viewpoints of each character.  It was simply amazing.  Trust me, each character contributes significantly to the whole of the story.<br /><br />Hosanna is the mother of Matriece and Vonette, who are as different as night and day.  However, Hosanna is now deceased, but still watches over her daughters, especially Matriece, who has the power to seek the revenge she never lived to pursue.  Will Matriece fulfill her late mother's wishes in the end?  You should definintely read this story to find out.  This is a nice long read that entertains at best.  I recommend it.	2004-07-22

It is the typical &quot;relationship rollercoaster&quot; book, but it has some good qualities.  The author's dialect was very humorous and his choice of words was very unnecessary at times.  I have read plenty of books, but I often found myself pulling out the dictionary on some of the words the author threw out there.  I also must say that I feel like I have had a lesson on Spanish after reading this book. Also, I found the profanity to take away from the story, rather than add to it. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the story he had to tell.<br />Myles is a good man who carries his heart on his shoulders, and is tired of what the dating scene has to offer, until Marisa Marrero comes along.  Marisa is a female that is used to getting the attention of males, and when she meets Myles, he falls head over heels for her.  However, you know Marisa will not let things go too easy for Myles, because she takes him on an emotional rollercoaster, before finally deciding if she would like him to stay on for the ride.<br />Another character in the book worth mentioning includes Myles' all too funny younger brother Amir.  His witty remarks will keep you laughing, if nothing else.  Although I found this book to be slow in the areas were Myles is constantly &quot;sweating&quot; Marissa, it tended to make up for that in other areas.<br />Although this may not be the best book by Marcus Major, I'm sure his writing will get better with time, and I am looking forward to reading more of his novels.	2003-01-13

Lolita took us to a whole new level in this book, putting aside the \\"sister-girlfriend\\" writing style, and showing us that she can also write on a deeper level.  She is truly a multi-talented writer.<br />This novel tells the story of the Boten family, definitely a family like none other.  The Boten family deals with the curse of generational incest, drugs, voodoo, and just about anything else you can imagine.  Ophelia is the main character who was also once \\"caught up in the curse\\", who manages to somehow break this generational curse through much determination and tenacity.  One after the other, each person in the family is doomed to something horrible that will happen...  There are Ophelia's brothers Lay and Polo; Polo's girlfriend, Coolie; Ophelia's parents Grace and Big Daddy; Ophelia's uncle Walter and evil, mysterious wife Sukie.  These are only some of the character, but the main nonetheless.<br />Definitely get this book and become a part of the wiles and woes that the curse of the Boten family will take you through.  This is a must the best of Ms. Files reads to date!  I am anxiously looking forward to her next read.	2002-10-17

I am absolutely intrigued by this profound historical novel that depicts the life and times of Lifee and Mor during and after slavery.  This is probably the best fiction novel about the effects of slavery that I have read to date!  Although the novel begins in the time of slavery, it is not just about that.  It also tells how two strong, triumphant characters, Mor and Lifee, rose above the effects of slavery after being freed, and established a legacy of their own for their family and ancestors.  Mor, is the strong male character, who is joined with Lifee, the strong-willed, virtuous female character, through slavery.  After being freed, these two set off to start a life of their own.  The characters showed what lovingkindness is all about as they openly embraced other freed slaves as themselves who needed help, and helped build a family.  It makes me proud to know that in those times black people openly helped one another and treated everyone like family.  Together, Lifee, Mor, and the rest of the family endured.  This is a must read!!	2002-08-26

Your heart goes out to her and the family as she tells the story of how it all began, and we begin to realize where it ends up. You wonder if Kenzie grows or does she remain forever trapped by the what she had to endure all of her life.  There is tragedy, pain, and heart ache as Kenzie tells each story, and my heart went out to not only her, but Malcolm and Della as well.  I hated for the story to end, because Kenzie was finally able to make peace in a way that only God could give you.  There is a lesson to be learned from this story.	2002-08-21

Terry has the skills! I really enjoyed this novel written from the 6 different viewpoints of Viola - the tell-it-like-it-is mother of the family; Cecil - the distant father of the family, who Viola pushed away a long time ago; Charlotte - the middle child who wants attention so bad, she chooses to act hateful and selfish toward everyone in her family to get it; Paris - the oldest and only child in the family to go to college who has money, but lacks other things in life and longs to be perfect; Janelle - the baby of the family who can be downright loony at times; and Lewis - the only son who is the typical &quot;black sheep&quot; of the family.<br />Although noone in the Price family is perfect, these characters eventually learn to put family first, and put aside their own selfish needs.  What I enjoyed most about this story is that these characters grew throughout the story, and by the end, they all were much better people than they were at the beginning.  Even though it takes a tragedy to bring this family together, they realized that family is always first.<br />Although there are many characters in this book, I can still see this becoming a movie.  I am sure you will enjoy every bit of it as I did.  There is quite a bit of blunt vulgarity (and the story would have been just as good without it), but if you manage to make it through that, you will have enjoyed another great read by Ms. Terry Mac.	2002-01-30

This is a heart-warming story about family and the secrets that sometimes exist within it.  It is a story about the lives of two sisters and their mother, and how each one of them learn to release the &quot;burdens&quot; they have carried with them for so many years, and evolve into the true women they were intended to be.  It is a story about letting go and realizing that noone is perfect, and that family will be there for you no matter what.  I especially liked how the characters grew toward the end of the book, and learned to accept each other for who they are. I hope that there will be a sequel to explain Celeste's situation with Everett, Ronnie's new life in Prosper, Nikki's newfound profession and relationship with Brian, and Della's new beginning with long-time friend Lester.  I really enjoyed the story, and know that a sequel will be even better.	2002-01-01

I felt so much better after reading this book, because in some of the many stories told by twentysomethings all over, I could see the very same things I have been through or am going through.  This was a very informative read.  The one thing missing would be more advice.  The stories themselves will let you know that you are not the only person going through this crisis, and that it is just a normal phase of most twentysomething lives.  However, if the authors would have given more advice, rather than comments on each of the stories told, the book would have been even better.  This is overall a great read that all twentysomethings should read.	2001-12-06

Milk in My Coffee shows the struggles of what love, friendship, betrayal, and family entail when put together.  The novel also gives us a glimpse of what bi-racial couples go through.  After reading MIMC, you will begin to realize that love has no color.  As long as the person you're in a relationship with is making you happy, that is the only thing that matters.  You can either be miserable and alone, because of what others might think, or you can choose love and happiness.  That is what this book symbolizes.  The twists and turns, and surprises in this book will keep you turning the pages until the end.	2001-11-13

Although it had my interest until the end, I agree with a past reviewer, that there did seem to be a climatic error, with Sugar being referred to as Shirley's great-grandchild. Who knows? Maybe that was the author's intention in some way. I just didn't get it. However, this story tells how friendship can overcome all adversity. There were two totally different women brought together, Pearl and Sugar. Pearl was a 60 year old church-going woman that no one would ever suspect befriending someone like Sugar. Sugar was half Pearl's age and a prostitute. She had to learn to make it on her own, growing up without a mother or father, or any proper guidance. Therefore, she turned to the only thing she knew of, selling her body to make a living. There is a surprise at the end, but you'll have to read it to find out what it is. This novel makes one think of why we should not judge others, because one never knows what the other person has been through and why they are the way they are. My heart went out to Sugar while I was reading this book. I cannot wait to get my hands on the sequel to this book, entitled &quot;This Bitter Earth&quot;. I hope that Bernice includes Pearl in this book. I just loved her character. Anyway, I can't wait to hear the continuation of Sugar's story!	2001-08-24

I read this book about 13 years ago and recently decided to reread since the long-awaited sequel is finally here.  I honestly thought that maybe I had outgrown the style of writing (i.e. foul language, etc).  However, I must say, this book drew me in the same way it did when I first read it years ago.  This is absolutely one of the best books I have ever read!  The story-line was so good that the language didn't even matter anymore.  Winter was a cold, selfish girl, but I still found myself rooting for her, hoping that she would just finally get it together.  Unfortunately, we all know how her story ends...  I was once again enthralled and drawn into the life of Winter and the Santiagas and could not put the book down.  The is a classic that will never get old.

She is an excellent writer and one of my favorite arabesque romance writers.  However, I feel that this book was not as good as the two previous books I read, A Private Affair and Pieces of Dreams.  After reading those books, maybe my expectations of this book were too high.  Chances Are was very predictable and seemed rushed. However, it seemed to pick up speed toward the end.  It was a good read overall, for the fact that a woman can endure hardship and still make it above all.  Dionne had unconditional love for her daughter, Niyah, and did not want to do anything to sacrifice that, even if it meant keeping the truth from her.  The ending is good, but would have been better if it was more detailed, and not so brief.  The good thing is Dionne was able to overcome her fears and find love in the end.  Donna Hill still remains to be one of my favorite authors and I will continue to read all of her books.  Keep them coming Ms. Hill!	2001-06-08

Although the author was very vivid with the descriptions of each character and the environment around them, I could not help but feel like I was in a dark maze and could not get out.  The good point about the book is that the author allowed for the reader to develop each character and their personalities very clearly.  I could picture May bickering around in her daily robe after work, and Ruth moving about trying to be extra careful not to strike one of May's nerves, and Ruby constantly smiling with those rotten teeth of his. However, I could not help feeling sorry for Ruth and the whole life she lived.  From the time she was a child, she had no choice but to accept that she could not have a better life.  May was mean and miserable and eventually got what was coming to her, although I did feel sorry for her in the end.  Ruby seemed to have a heart, but his child-hood destroyed any hope that was left for his sanity.  The ending of the book was surprising and finally had my attention.  The most depressing part about this book is that Ruth was so unfortunate in her upbringing that she never did believe that there was hope for her in the future.	2001-04-20

Not only was it realistic, but also a very good love story as well.  Every character could have easily been real, for there were some real-life situations portrayed in this book.  The love thing between Fire and Sylvia was one that kept things flowing.  Not only that, but every character's life had an interesting story to  tell.. some happy, some sad, some good, some bad.  I just wished Ian could  have turned his life around and accepted who he was.  I'm glad Fire and  Sylvia finally decided to settle their differences.
