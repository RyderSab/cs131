Diario de Un Soldado de Napole&oacute;n de Jakob Walter publicado por Edhasa, es una cr&oacute;nica cruda de la retirada de Rusia por los Ej&eacute;rcitos Napole&oacute;nicos(Grande Armee), una cosa es leer la historia, escrita a&ntilde;os despu&eacute;s y otra leer a un veterano de los pocos que regresaron(de 600,000 solo regresaron 25.000 con vida o lisiados), comentar sobre la vicisitudes que tuvieron que pasar para mantenerse vivo, robar, matar, padecer fri&oacute;, hambre, sed y la gran decepci&oacute;n de luchar una guerra que no era suya, en este punto tengo que aclarar que me extra&ntilde;o mucho que Jakob no emitiera un juicio en contra de los Franceses, no toca temas pol&iacute;ticos, solo describe sus vivencias desde 1806 hasta su regreso en 1813 casi irreconocible por las penurias vividas.<br /><br />Hace algunos a&ntilde;os le&iacute; con mucho animo otras memorias \\"MEMOIRS OF A POLISH LANCER : The Pamietniki of Dezydery Chlapowski\\" , en esta se describe con mayor romanticismo la participaci&oacute;n del autor en la campa&ntilde;a Peninsular y las batallas en Rusia, pero el soldado Jakob es un simple soldado de infanter&iacute;a, lo cual hace esta autobiograf&iacute;a muy singular ya que no hay muchas escritas por ellos. La indiferencia hacia la muerte, y la realidad de la guerra son muy bien descritas, despu&eacute;s de una batalla, la descripci&oacute;n de la gran cantidad de muertos y heridos son comparadas con una visi&oacute;n horrorosa del Juicio final.<br /><br />El libro trae ilustraciones en blanco y negro, dos mapas, una cronolog&iacute;a de hechos mas importantes,una introduccion muy interesante de Marc Raeff donde explica muy bien la situacion de la Europa en las guerras Napoleonicas y el porque de la invasion a Rusia, hay una valoracion historica de la memorias por Frank Melvin, adem&aacute;s de seis cartas escritas tambi&eacute;n por veteranos, el libro es peque&ntilde;o (209 pag), as&iacute; que se puede leer en un fin de semana, muy recomendado aunque no seas fan de la era Napole&oacute;nica, es una historia sobre los verdaderos horrores de la guerra.<br /><br />Otras memorias de las guerras Napoleonicas recomendas: \\"In the Legions of Napoleon:The Memoirs of a Polish Officer in Spain and Russia, 1808-1813 by Heinrich Von Brandt\\", \\"The Exploits of Baron De Marbot by Baron De Marbot\\", para leer sobre la retirada de la Grande Armee en 1812, vista por los rusos,les recomiendo \\"In the Service of the Tsar Against Napoleon:The Memoirs of Denis Davidov, 1806-1814\\".of Napoleon:The Memoirs of a Polish Officer in Spain and Russia, 1808-1813 by Heinrich Von Brandt\\", \\"The Exploits of Baron De Marbot by Baron De Marbot\\", para leer sobre la retirada de la Grande Armee en 1812, vista por los rusos,les recomiendo \\"In the Service of the Tsar Against Napoleon:The Memoirs of Denis Davidov, 1806-1814\\".	2005-09-28

Escribir una Novela sobre un personaje tan Enigm&aacute;tico y legendario no es cosa f&aacute;cil, con tantas dudas que se crean por las leyendas a trav&eacute;s del tiempo, pero Max Gallo lo a logrado de manera magistral, una recreaci&oacute;n admirable del personaje de Julio Cesar, desde su infancia hasta su muerte en manos del senado, la novela nos lleva por una vida de aventuras, traici&oacute;n,  grandes conquistas, cruzamos el Rubicon, desafiamos al Senado, peleamos por la republica Romana y vemos su caida, recorremos el gran Imperio Romano,luchamos contra piratas y galos,llevamos las PAX Romana a Egipto, conocemos los amores del Cesar(mujeres y hombres), no adentramos en las tramas pol&iacute;ticas de la antigua Roma, para conocer aun personaje muy humano, que tiene una vida solitaria, aun teniendo tantas conquistas, lujos y amores, porque Cesar tiene lo que desea pero aun as&iacute; no le llenan.<br /><br />Algunas fases del Emperador son pasadas de manera fugas, en especial la parte pol&iacute;tica y reformista de Cesar, si eres un amante de la antigua Roma te fascinar&aacute; la descripci&oacute;n que logra Gallo, en especial como se forja la caida de la Republica y nace el Imperio Romano,excelente rigor hist&oacute;rico, pero en 416 paginas creo que es muy poco para una biograf&iacute;a dedicada a un personaje que cambio la historia de una civilizaci&oacute;n. Aun as&iacute;, la novela esta muy bien traducida, es interesante y muy recomendada.	2005-09-28

Great description of the photos by Mr. Neil Leonard, the book is only 95 pages but you would find the most famous redcoat regiments(the 95th \\"rifle\\" regiment) plus the German Units(only two photos)<br /><br />I would prefer to see one book for the Infantry and another for Cavalry and Artillery but may be in another publication, also another title dedicated to the Victorian Soldier. Too small for my taste but many beautiful color photos.

The author have try to compress the largest amount of information into the smallest possible space without missing key facts of WHO, WHEN, HOW and where.<br /><br />This work cover the earlier campaings of the XIX century to the conclusion of the South African War in 1902(Anglo-Boer War). The text is divides geographically,the first chapter is dedicated to Great Britain(British Army, Royal Navy,British Ministries and Commanders), then we start with the Indian Subcontinent, Africa and the Mediterranean, the East, the Americas and the Atlantic, and Australasia and the Pacific. In every Chapter we find a brief explanation or outline of the military operations, the opposite armies with many period photographs, drawings, maps and diagrams. One of the final sections is dedicated to the biographies of some leading and often colourful military figures, like Banden-Powell, Wolseley, Kitchener and Frederick Roberts. You can also find the victorian enemies, the Mahdi(Mohammed Ahmed Ibn Seyyd Abdullah), Nana Sahid(Lead the mutineers in 1857).

He derided the comfortable life of establishment clergy and demanded a moral decency based on the teachings of Christ. With three Popes simultaneously occupying the chair of Peter, how could anyone respect the Catholic hierarchy? Hus make some reformation to the liturgy like singing in Czech and the communion in both kind,(wine and breath, when I was a Kid in Nicaragua it was rare to receive both, that was in 1983)everyone was raised in a surge of religious reformation combined with Czech national pride, at the end Jan Hus was put to trial for heresy and was burned to death at the stake. The death of this hero for many Bohemias sparked a hussite Movement which consisted of two distinct parts, the moderate Utraquists (utrae means equal, because of the communion in either form) and the radical Taborites (after the town of Tabor which they founded). Jan Zizka's support the Hus beliefs and was one of the Taborites General.<br /><br />  With all this details is hard to make a clear explanation in 48 pages but as other titles of Mr. Turnbull has made a nice clear summary of the Hussite Wars and a great contribution for all the fans of late medieval military history.

The innovations of Jan Zizka would last well into the 16th Century, the use of the famous Hussite wagons, the important of the missilemen with handguns and artillery, although the Hussites were by no means the inventors of medievak artillery, their employment of firearms showed an understandings of how to use technology to its best effect.

De Rocca gives vivid accounts of military operations such as the march to Madrid and Napoleon's entry into the city and the subsequent battles in which he took part, the pursuit of Sir John Moore's army to Corunna, the battle at Talavera, which took place while he was away from Spain for a few months, and the battles that followed against the English under General Sir Arthur Wellesley, now in command in the Iberian peninsula. He also describes the enormous personal dangers he faced in every Spanish village that the French army entered, where every man, woman and child was intent on their death, yet he still pays tribute to the character of their enemies even when his own life was at risk from them.<br />You will enjoy this book.	2001-08-15

The author covers all of the prinicipal campaigns of the First Empire, from Austerlitz to Waterloo, as well as the principal characters involved in the saga - the Emperor himself, Davout, Lassale, Murat, Wellington and Brunswick. The 77 full page, full colour plates by artist Jack Girbal are important to the book, as they show in detail the different units of Napolean's army and cavalry in action during all the campaigns from 1805 to 1815.

It is a worthy and original compliment to any collection, standing equally impressively alongside books containing contemporary prints by Martinet, the later Rousselot and Bucquoy`s and modern day Michel Petard examples of Napoleonic uniforms.

Created, built and nurtured as a bodyguard for Napoleon, it grew from a brigade of fewer than two thousand men into a virtual army, and became 'a human fortress which no one but [Napoleon] could dominate and no enemy could penetrate'. And, on such battlefields as Austerlitz, Jena, Friedland, Wagram and Waterloo, it won the laurels of undying fame.  Written by France's foremost historian of the Napoleonic Wars, Commandant Henry Lachouque, and translated and adapted by Anne S. K. Brown, this sumptuous work is enhanced by over 180 illustrations, including 86 plates in full colour.  This new printing from the second, revised edition of Lachouque's masterwork will be especially welcomed by students of Napoleonic history. The plates alone are uniquely valuable as a source of uniform colours and style, and the text provides the definitive history of an elite body of men. With its vivid narrative and lavish illustrations, The Anatomy of Glory can lay justifiable claim to be one of the most magnificent books on military history ever published. The critical acclaim that greeted it upon its first publication provides ample testimony to its reputation. The Anatomy of Glory is both informative and entertaining: a work of unquestionable quality - termed a masterpiece by Elting - and a monumental contribution to Napoleonic literature.	2001-02-26

El sol de Breda es el tercer volumen de la serie. Flandes, 1625. Alistado como mochilero del capit&aacute;n Alatriste en los tercios viejos que asedian Breda, &Iacute;&ntilde;igo Balboa es testigo excepcional de la rendici&oacute;n de la ciudad, cuyos pormenores narrar&aacute; diez a&ntilde;os m&aacute;s tarde para un cuadro famoso de su amigo Diego Vel&aacute;zquez.<br />El Capit&aacute;n Alatriste abandona la villa y corte de Madrid para marchar hac&iacute;a Flandes y sus sangrientas batallas. Hasta el momento muchos dicen que El Sol de Breda es el mejor de los tres libros que han sido editados yo creo que los tres son muy entretenidos. Dejando a un lado las intrigas de la corte, Don Diego Alatriste vive y hace vivir la crueldad e injusticia y realidad de la guerra en 1625. Haciendo gala de un rigor hist&oacute;rico, Reverte refleja un per&iacute;odo de Espa&ntilde;a del que se ha publicado muy poco y que para muchos es hoy en d&iacute;a desconocido.

Perhaps precisely because he is not a Carthusian monk(the author), but rather a journalist and a man of faith who has stayed at several Charterhouses around the world, Robin Bruce Lockhart has been able to maintain an informative balance between detachment and insight, and thus keep the very secrets he purports to reveal.<br />He reveals: fundamentals of monastic and eremitic spirituality, a history of the Carthusian order, a life of its founder, St. Bruno, a summary of Carthusian vocations and charisms, a dash through the network of 24 Charterhouses around the world today (18 for monks, 6 for nuns, mainly in France, Spain, and Italy, but also in Germany, Switzerland, Brazil, Portugal, Slovenia, and the U.S.), a description of present Carthusian governance and bureaucracy, a sample of an individual monk or nun's regimen of prayer and work (definitely not for anyone who likes eight hours' sleep: Carthusians sleep from 8 to 11.45 p.m. and from 2.45 to 6.45 a.m.), and, to top off this exclusive compendium, a terrific bibliography.	2000-12-16

This is the first of two books depicting uniforms of Napoleon III's Imperial Guard troops. the Zouaves,Voltigeurs of the Imperial Guard and many more plates from the Imperial troops<br />In July 1870, France declared war on Prussia in part over a disagreement about a Prussian prince accepting the crown of Spain. By September 1870, a French army had been defeated, Emperor Napoleon III captured at Sedan, France declared a republic, and Paris under siege. In January 1871, Wilhelm I of Prussia was crowned Kaiser Wilhelm I of a unified Germany at Versailles, Paris fell, and France surrendered, losing Alsace and Lorraine and forced to pay huge reparations. Otto von Bismarck, Chancellor of Prussia since 1862, and now Germany, subsequently sought to keep France isolated to prevent the recovery of Alsace and Lorraine.<br />The Second Empire, under Napoleon III, was a reaction against the bourgeois age of the previous ruler King Louis Philippe in spirit as well as in deed. The army, elevated from tactful obscurity, was re-modelled on Napoleonic lines, and its neglected iconography revived in the form of the eagle, the crowned 'N' and the Imperial bee. What was needed to complete the resurrection was victory in the field. It is hardly surprising that Napoleon and the army were mindful of the great Napoleonic traditions and were anxious to emulate them. Their first real opportunity came with the Crimean War, in which, despite a muddled campaign, the army acquitted itself well. In 1859 it was again successful, against the Austrians this time, with costly victories at Magenta and Solferino. Their next adventure, unfortunately, ended in a humiliating withdrawal, after a protracted anti-guerrilla struggle in Mexico. Meanwhile, back in Europe, Prussia was fast emerging as a challenge to France's military pre-eminence. In concert with Austria, Bismarck first crushed Denmark before turning on Austria herself. The victory at Sadowa in 1866 stunned Europe, and in Paris Napoleon and his advisers set to thinking of a way to counter this new threat. In this first of two volumes looking at the French Army of the Franco-Prussian War, Stephen Shann and Louis Delperier examine the history, organisation and weapons of the French Imperial troops.<br />Remember there are two volumes this is the Imperial troops there is also the republican troopsbefore turning on Austria herself.

In the British Army under the Duke of Wellington one or two units, such as those of the Light Division, could lay claim to &eacute;lite status on the basis of their records. But surely the &eacute;lite troops of Wellington's army were the Rifleman. This volume places much emphasis on examining the lives and experience of the rank-and-file soldiery. Living conditions, training and career patterns in the British Army during this time of reform and re-equipment are examined, as are the recruitment and social backgrounds of the bulk of the force. The book also pays attention to tactics and weaponry, and in combining these two complimentary strands under one title presents an important insight into the reasons for the rise of Britain as a major military power during the Napoleonic period.<br />150 color and b/w illustrations	2000-10-31

Fiercely independent, the clans comprised an agricultural peasantry dominated by a warrior aristocracy.<br /> They held most forms of authority outside of the clan in contempt and did not submit to London meekly. Their first loyalty was to the exiled house of Stuart and in a series of rebellions in 1689, 1715 and finally in 1745 the Highland clans rose against the ruling monarch. The author examines in detail the society that produced these fierce fighters and the tactics they used in battle including the feared 'Highland Charge'. The social structure of the clans, their organisation, equipment and clothing are closely examined, including an interesting section on the development of the Scottish plaid that culminated in the famous Highland kilt. Weapons and tactics are all studied at length, and a final evaluation of the Highland clansman's effectiveness is achieved by an in-depth analysis of their performance in the three major battles of Killiecrankie, Prestonpans and Culloden.<br />As the Scottish clan system developed, their interaction with one another often led to conflict. Special attention in this book is given to the rise and fall of the Jacobite cause under `Bonny Prince Charlie' in the 1745 rebellion,great illustration by Angus McBride which gives the reader a unique insight into the life of the Highlander's.	2000-10-31

There is a clear inference that had they attacked the Russians in and around the Turkish redoubts - which is what Raglan intended - then the disaster would have been avoided.<br />An illustrated history of the Charge of the Light Brigade, October, 1854. Illustrated with color plates,  B&amp;W photographs and contemporary illustrations.<br />The Organization, Formations and movements, uniforms and equipment of the Light and Cavalry Brigade and the general progress of the Crimean Campaign up to and including the Battle of Balaclava.

In 1855, Tolstoy was a soldier in the Crimean War and a witness to many atrocities. One that would stay with him was the image of two children killed in a shelling. His experiences during the war made up the contents of his work The Sebastopol Sketches, many of which he drafted on the battlefield.<br />The book is divide in three short stories stem from Tolstoy's military experience during the Crimean War: &quot;Sebastopol in December,&quot; &quot;Sebastopol in May,&quot; and &quot;Sebastopol in August 1855.&quot;<br />During this time, the young Tolstoy gave himself over to the decadent life that was common for men of his class, catching a venereal disease as well as drinking heavily and sustaining enormous gambling debts which included the loss of some of his prized property at Yasnaya.<br />I really enjoy reading this book,Tolstoy's reactions to the fighting at Sebastopol are really crude, if you are interesting in The Crimean War but from the Russian side you may find what you are looking for in this great book	2000-10-31

This book combines such descriptions from &quot;The Times&quot; of London with a discussion of the war, based on historical scholarship.|In addition to the famous accounts submitted by William Howard Russell, all areas of the Black Sea theatre are covered, including the Sea of Azov, the Caucasus and Bulgaria, along with other major theatre of war, the Baltic, where the Admiral and Commander-in-Chief sometimes acted as &quot;Times&quot; correspondent. This marks a return to the contemporary perception of the war, where the whole conflict was observed, rather than the subsequent concentration on the heroism, incompetence and recovery on the few square miles of the Crimean Uplands that have come to dominate the modern image of the war.  103 b&amp;w illustrations	2000-10-13

Federal troops often sported uniforms with strong European ties, including chasseur-style coats and the famous French Zouave outfit. The 39th New York Volunteers wore colorful uniforms copied from the Italian bersaglieri.<br />When President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to fight the South in April 1861, he placed a heavy burden on an unprepared quartermaster department. Supplies of good-quality cheap cloth for uniforms were lacking. Some states were asked to provide their own uniforms for their recruits, and the quality and variety seemed limitless. Many early Union militia units adopted gray as their dress color, while the quality of material ranged from superior to poor.  The North, faced numerous problems in providing uniforms for its troops. States issued jackets, shirts and trousers sewed by womens' volunteer aid societies. A shortage of material meant that a mixture of shades and hues was commonplace.<br />There are also chapters on the many colourful militia regiments raised to swell the Northern Army, including Zouaves, Chasseurs, Lancers, and Hussars in their own spectacular uniforms as well as the little known role of American Indian Cavalry units<br />The book contains 150 colour &amp; b/w illustrations(more w/b that colour)if you would like to buy this book you can also consider  Don Troiani's Soldiers in America 1754-1865 and Don Troiani's Civil War	2000-10-07

There was a time when I would buy  every Osprey Napoleonic title. This was until, when doing research in  primary sources on my own, I found that many of these books, and their  attendant art work, to be generally average at best, and sometimes not  reliable at all.<br />I found the volume on Wellingtons Highlanders troops  fascinating.  The Highland recruited, developed, or thrown together to  combat the swarms of very effective are meticulously listed in this volume  and it gives a very good picture of the units that gradually developed into  the 79th Cameron and effective 92nd Gordons and  infantry regiments of the  Wellingtons Army. What is also interesting is the varieties of both  clothing and uniforms these varied corps wore (and there is a difference),  being influnce by their culture(Scottish). It is a true menagerie for  uniformologists.<br />I'm sure everyone is very familiar with the Men-at-Arms  format, but I'll briefly review it for anyone not familiar with it. The  Men-at-Arms series is a general, somewhat brief (limited to 48 pages)  uniform history of famous units and/or armies in specific wars or  campaigns. They are profusely illustrated with relevant illustrations of  uniforms, as well as eight color plates of the subject in question by a  contemporary military artist. The narrative describes the uniforms in  detail, sometimes with a brief history of either the unit, personalities,  or both. Additionally, the plates are explained and there is a necessarily  brief note on sources. In the hands of an expert such as Stuart Reid, this  can be a narrative overflowing with useful, very accurate, and sometimes  newfound information. All of the 48-page volumes have excellent color  plates; however, my favorites are those by Eugene Leliepvre,Bryan Fosten  and Francis Back. These are very talented artists give us very realistic  renderings of what soldiers undoubtedly looked like on campaign and in  combat.<br />These book is thorough studies, written in a scholarly manner  with well thought out illustrations and color plates.Stuart Reid and Osprey  have done us a great service with these volume and all of them belong on  our bookshelves. They are accurate, packed with information, written by an  acknowledged authority of the periods covered, who is a meticulous  researcher and an entertaining author. What these volumes proved to me is  that we really shouldn't judge a book (or a series, for that matter) by its  cover or its title. Osprey has once again, in my mind, placed itself in the  top notch of military history books available for research purposes, as  well as entertainment.<br />Anyone who consider himself a fan of the  Highlanders Regiments would enjoy this fascinating book I also recomened  the Highland Clansman 1689-1746 from the same author excellent and very  informative.e book is thorough studies, written in a scholarly manner  with well thought out illustrations and color plates.Stuart Reid and Osprey  have done us a great service with these volume and all of them belong on  our bookshelves.

The Guard differed  from the guard corps of other European sovereigns of the period, in that  its function was rather functional than ceremonial, and its expansion was  such that it came to represent a considerable portion of France's military  establishment. By supplying personnel to other units, it functioned as a  training school for the remainder of the army, yet the elite status of the  guard did little to protect its soldiers from the rigours of combat in the  brutal Napoleonic Wars.<br />I would like to finish saying that this book is  a great study of Napoleon's Imperial Guard, with a detailed history of the  daily life and dutys of those regiments featured, the author try to focus  here the presenting uniforms and detailed pieces of equipment, show men in  actual conditions of battle and peacetime.	2000-08-30
