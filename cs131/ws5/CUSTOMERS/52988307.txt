US	52988307	R2VG7V5PLVJB0M	0802135811	828895855	The Invention of Love	Books	4	7	11	N	N	Beautiful play about art and homosexual love	I like this play because it blends the aesthetic with the dramatic.  It's aesthetic because it discusses the great works of literature with the great writers and critics of that time.  It's dramatic because this discussion provides an interesting background to an issue that makes difficult the lives of the main characters A.E. Houseman and Oscar Wilde: homosexual love.  For Houseman the problem is unrequited love.  For Oscar Wilde it is a charge of sodomy.<br />The point of classical scholarship is to study Greek and Latin works-that is the vocation of the scholars in this play.  According to Oscar Wilde, to be an \\"aesthete\\" means to believe that all beauty emanates from Greek writing and sculpture particularly sculpture of the nude male form.  In the play A.E. Houseman and his scholarly contemporaries-Ruskin and Pater--point out that much Latin and Greek poetry was written by one man who was in love with another.  What makes the play ironic is how this aspect of these ancient cultures flies in the face of contemporary Victorian mores.  To wit: the characters in the play are homosexual and that was a crime in 19th century England.<br />Every work of art must have a point or it's pointless.  The point in this play is how the definition of love has come full circle since ancient Greece:  what was once socially acceptable, boy love (i.e. pedophilia), is now anathema.  And what is at best today grudgingly tolerated, homosexual love, was common practice in ancient Greece at least among the dramatists, poets, and philosophers. Stoppard writes:  \\"Before Plato could describe love, the loved one had to be invented.\\"  Hence the title: \\"Invention of Love\\".<br />When Houseman died he had been successful in his career but not in his desire for eros: He says \\"the grave's a fine and private place but none I think there do embrace\\".	2002-01-15

This one at 900 plus pages is long but well worth the effort. As with the other Dostoevsky novels the dominant theme is religion. Here Dostoevsky says that you cannot subject the existence of God to intellectual scrutiny rather you must have faith to accept God. As the character Ivan Kamarazov so eloquently argues, logic would indicate there is no God and no Heaven. So if there is no immortality then nothing is immoral. &quot;Everything is permissible&quot; as other reviewers have noted. Advocating the opposite position is the Greek Orthodox monk Father Zosima whose legendary faith attracts a horde of admirers including Aloshya Kamarazov. The Devil himself, who of course believes in God, says &quot;Besides in matters of faith, proof, especially ,material proof is pretty useless.&quot;<br />One striking feature of this novel is how the different characters here evolve as distinct personalities under Dostoevksy?s stewardship. After hundreds of pages of prose we can clearly recognize that the brothers Ivan, Aloshya, and Dmitry are quite different from one other and not just two-dimensional, cartoon like, parodies of themselves The literary critic Harold Bloom says that Shakespeare invented personality in it's written form you can see what he means when you read Dostoevsky implement this skill.<br />This novel is steeped in psychology and theology and argues against the European enlightenment encroaching upon Mother Russia. Yet it is not all erudite, high-brow scholarly stuff. In his running commentary on the novel itself, Dostoevsky clearly says he intends his book to be entertainment. So these themes are woven into a captivating detective story which as everyone knows is who committed parricide.<br />One tip: don't look at the table of contents because it tends to give away the plot. Final comment: it is amazing that this novel is almost all dialogue or Dostoevsky probing the thoughts of the characters. There is almost no description of the setting or explanation of events that have transpired. Rather these events unfold right in front of us and we are privy to all their nuances.on of the setting or explanation of events that have transpired.

It's memoir like style is evocative of the best of Naipal. Couple that with his talents as a journalist and his keen eye for controversy and you have a solid travelogue that addresses important topics of Southern culture.<br />When V.S. Naipal, raised in Trinidad of Indian parents, makes a wide swath through the Deep South he plunges headlong into its controversies while making notable mention of what makes it beautiful and different.  This is typical Naipal, his views on colonization and the freedom granted to people who no longer live under dominion of the conquering powers would get him into much trouble were he, say, professor of English at Duke University.  But being both a minority and a former colonial subject he can freely say what others might cower away from.<br />For example, in \\"A Turn in the South\\" Naipal travels to Missippi to visit Booker T. Washington's Tuskegee Institute. If you've read \\"Up from Slavery\\" you know of Washington and his school built to educate the recently-freed negro to whether the vicissitudes of living in the dominate apartheid white culture.  That was a grand accomplishment indeed.  But what does Naipal highlight when he rolls into town? It is the drunken, unemployed black men hanging literally at the door of this great school.  It is this irony which makes this section of the travelogue so pleasurable to read.<br />Another great section is Naipal's journey to Atlanta, Georgia the self-proclaimed \\"black mecca\\"--the \\"city that is too busy to hate\\". Seeking to dig beneath the glass and steel veneer of the downtown skyline Naipal seeks out the most controversial local political character Josea Williams. For those who do not know him, Mr. Williams is the Al Sharpton of the South, a race baiter par excellence.<br />As a South Carolina native I am pleased that Naipal chose Charleston, South Carolina for a stop over.  He visits one of the local plantations as the guest of the editor of \\"The News and Courier\\"newspaper whose family owned the plantation since the days of slavery. Naipal's visit is not critical as might be the case with people in the non-South diaspora.  Yankee writers like John Steinbeck--read \\"Travels with Charlie\\"-- tend to dismiss the region as backward, unenlightened, and owing reparations.  But Naipal's jaunt is whimsical-written in the Magnolia and Moonlight voice that Naipal points out is what pleases the Southerner. Naipal is dead-on accurate when he says that to a Southerner \\"history is religion\\". We believe deeply in our heritage and decorate our landscape with commerative plaques and Confederate flags.  The plantation that Naipal visits is just one oversized monument to our ante-bellum lore.<br />In my mind this is among the great travel essays comparable to those of Mark Twain's trip around the world, Gustave Flaubert's journey to Egypt, and D.H. Lawrence's time spent in Italy.  I can't end here without mentioning that Naipal's brother Shrinivas wrote an excellent travelogue of Africa--equally filled with controversial vignettes--called &quot;East to West&quot;.The News and Courier\\"newspaper whose family owned the plantation since the days of slavery.

All this highbrow entertainment deasl with cerebral subjects that lend themselves quite well to drama because of their historical import and our fascinating with the mind of genius.<br />I did not get to see \\"Copenhagen\\" in New York or London so I bought the play's script in Boston.  There is an advantage to doing this because the play in book includes a discussion by the author, Michael Frayn, of what is fact and what is fiction and the politics and science around quantum mechanics and the uncertainty principal.<br />In \\"Copenhagen\\" Neils Bohr, the physicist, is living in occupied Denmark and his former prot&eacute;g&eacute; Werner Heisenberg is in Berlin working for Hilter's war machine.  His actual contribution to Hitler's war effort is the topic of the play and the subject of much historical debate.  Did Heisenberg deliberately fudge Hitler's efforts to build the atomic bomb or did he miscalculate how much Uranium 238 was needed to establish the critic mass necessary to sustain the explosion resulting for fission?  Did Heisenberg travel to Copenhagen to spy on Bohr and the Americans (assuming Bohr was in contact with them)?<br />The play is set in both the past and the present.  At the beginning we have the ghosts of the departed Heisenberg, Bohr, and Bohr's wife questioning what we all have wondered: why did Heisenberg travel to Denmark to see Bohr and what was discussed?  Bohr's wife helps us explore these subjects.  She is there to heighten the dramatic tension by question Heisenberg's motives directly and acting as a foil through which the other two characters can debate.  She is, however, extremely learned on the technical matter at hand.<br />I was puzzled about one point in the play and that is the fate of Neils Bohr's children.<br />Finally, the author broaches but then brushes aside the question of why so many of the great physicists were and are Jews: Bohr, Einstein, Fenyman, and Heisenberg (who he calls a \\"white jew\\" whatever that means).  Michael Frayn has his character Heisenberg say that Jews dominated theoretical physics. because as Jews chairs in the fields of applied (i.e. as opposed to theoretical) physics were reserved for Gentiles.  That would not have been true at Princeton so does not hold up under scrutiny.fate of Neils Bohr's children.<br />Finally, the author broaches but then brushes aside the question of why so many of the great physicists were and are Jews: Bohr, Einstein, Fenyman, and Heisenberg (who he calls a \\"white jew\\" whatever that means).

No wonder we didn't read this in high school	Having read &quot;A MidSummer's Night Dream&quot; I knew that the bard could pen page after page of love-filled, alluring rhyming verse.  But if that's what you fancy then you must read the sonnets and the long lyric poems contained in this Everyman's edition.<br />I'm trying to commit sonnet #18 to memory.  It famously starts &quot;shall I compare these to a summer's day&quot;.  These are among the greatest pick up lines of the 16th century.<br />The sonnets are beautiful in their appreciation of love and the feminie form.  Shakespeare must have been exactly as he was potrayed in the film &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;:  always on the prowl for females and continually in search of a muse.  (Interestingly the translation of &quot;muse&quot; in the 15th and 16th century is &quot;poet.)<br />Finally, the poem Venus and Adonis is more of this romantic banter.  This poem is red hot, much more erotic than anything you could read in Maxim or Cosmopolitan.  Consider this: &quot;Being so enraged (aroused), desire doth lender her force Courageously to pluck him from his horse...She red and hot as coals of glowing fire, He red for shame, but frosty in desire...Tis but a kiss I beg--what art thou coy.&quot;<br />This is titalliting, stimulating fair.  (&quot;Fair&quot; means pretty in old English.)  Who can read this without blushing.  No wonder we didn't read this in high school.	2001-09-30

He poems are too sentimental, too easy-to-read, and borrow too much from 18th century styles.  Well the critics might be right but I love this poetry and plan to read more.<br />Her most famous lines are here &quot;My candle burns at both ends...it gives a lovely light&quot;, her first famous poem is here &quot;Renascance&quot;--this spooky poem gained her a mentor and an education at Vassar--and also present are poems from &quot;Fatal Interview&quot; and &quot;Epitath for the Race of Man&quot;.  My favorite poems are the short ones that talk of love: these are the easy-to-read poems dismissed by the critics.<br />If you read this poem then you must read the potrait of Edna St. Vincent Millay in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and the memoir &quot;The Shores of Light&quot; by Edmund Wilson, the later book reviewer for The New Yorker magazine.<br />Edmun Wilson was just one of ESVM many jilted suitors.  But she let him down gently her said.  His book describes how he found work for her at Vanity Fair magazine.  ESVM evidently charmed all the men she came in touch with.  The editor of Vanity Fair complained that he could not have both of his editors in love with the same contributor to the magazine.<br />Many of the ESVM poems here have to do with nature, like the poem &quot;Spring&quot;.  Perhaps this is because she moved out of Greenwich Village to the country and there she wrote collections such as &quot;The Buck in Snow&quot;.  When she got married and left the city she didn't lose touch with her circle of fans and hangers-on including Edmun Wilson.  Wilson describes here there at her farm reciting her poetry--she knew all her poems by heart--to wide-eyed admirers.<br />Alot of her poems here have no title.  I imagine she might have felt that the title could be a distraction to a poem.  If you can't think of a good one then don't create one at all.<br />Finally, feminists certainly will be upset with lines like &quot;I, being born a woman and distressed By all the needs and notions of my kind...&quot;  But this is good stuff and lets us peer inside the female heart.  They are just like us men it appears &quot;...feel a certain zest to bear your body's weight upon my breast&quot;.

It's about a college professor who is forced from his position as dean because he is accused of using racial epithets during a class lecture.  Isn't that a familiar story at Brown and other school?<br />You can't say a lot about the characters in this story because that would give away the plot.  But Roth's novel is an attack on the militancy of college-campus political correctness and the feminists whose Roth character believes are hypocritcal.  Further the book is a discussion of the roles that race plays in America and what is means to be raised as a Jew.  There's lots of other themes too including man's preoccupation with sex which is, of course, what Roth writes about frequently.<br />The character Faunia refers to the novel's title, the \\"Humain Stain\\", when she says \\"That's what comes of hanging around all his life with people like us.  The human stain.\\"  The \\"he\\" she is referring to is a crow in the pet show.  Faunia likes to talk to crows.  She's supposed to be the village idiot in this novel, but she`s more comples than that.  In the same paragraph Roth mentions another bird, a swan.  Writing of the Greek gods, Roth says they are like humans in their cruelty--leaving stains of excrement and semen wherever they go--and their desire for erotic love.  He writes \\"...[Zeus] to enter her bizarrely as a flailing white Swan.\\"  This is a direct reference to the poem by William Butler Years \\"Leda and the Swan\\" which Roth quotes at length in his novel \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\"--whose very title is a psychological term for to the desire for erotica and the angst that causes because of cultural mores.  The poem reads in part \\"How can those terrified vague fingers [Leda] push the feathered glory [the Swan] from her loosening things?\\".<br />This book is a riveting read, long passages held me for page after page.  I could not put it down as Roth takes us inside the mind of Delphine Roux, the French teacher at Athena college who has created so much trouble for Coleman Silk, the main character in the novel.  Roth reveals her thoughts as she reflects on her status as a beautiful expatriate intellectual utterly alone in the word. She is miserable because she is despised by the female faculty members who hate her for her good looks and who, consequently, refuse to read her published writings.  She hates Coleman because her isn't intimidated by her beauty  like so many of the men are.  She feels lost as a expatriate: caught between two oceans and not certain to which shore to seek refuge.  She's a woman who desperately wants erotic love.  But she can't abide the many suitors she has at the school.  She goes to the New York Public library--anyone who lives in New York will tell you that the adjacent Bryant Park is a great pick up place--and looks wistfully at her intellectual peers: handsome men reading difficult books in those hallowed halls.  If only she could find someone like that at the far flung, mountain-enclosed school where she's surrounded by shallow thinking Philistines masquerading as intellectuals.<br />One fascinating feature of this novel is that it's all written in one voice.  There's no effort to reproduce accents like, say, William Faulkner would do.  And there's no effort to change the substance of the language from one character to the next.  Whether it's the uneducated Faunia speaking or the highly educated Coleman Silks, they all speak with the erudite voice of Philip Roth.  I find this technique a good one: why sully the great language in a novel just to sound like one of the locals?  That's my complaint with Irvine Welsh who writes in Scottish patois.<br />This novel spoke to me directly in two particular ways.  First Roth writes of the death of two children.  My own children are alive and O.K. but I felt compelled to rush to them as I read Roth's harrowing account of the two children dying a ghastly death.  It was such a page turning horror tale, as good as the only Stephen King I read, and had me so upset by the end that I almost flung the book across the room.  I haven't been moved by a book like that in a long time.  There should be a preface at that chapter: \\"not for the faint of heart\\".<br />Secondly, Roth wrote was speaking to me again, on the subject of living alone in the woods--since that is what I do--with Henry David Thoreau like authority.  The narrator of the novel is a writer who has fled the city for the quiet of the woods.  (Doesn`t Philip Roth live like this too?)  Roth says, \\"The secret to living in the rush of the world with a minimum of pain is to get as many people as possible to string along with your delusions; the trick to living alone up here, away from all agitating entanglements...is to organize the silence, to think of its mountaintop plenitude as capital, silence and wealth exponentially increasing....The trick is to find sustenance in [He quotes Nathaniel Hawthorne] `the communication of a solitary mind with itself``.

It's possible to do, but reading something not written in my maternal tounge makes one weary.<br />This novel is written in the council house patois of Edinburgh Scotland.  It's &quot;dae&quot; for do.  &quot;Snoggin&quot; for kissin.  And so forth.  The story is a good one but you don't need to read &quot;The Arabian Knights&quot; in Arabic so why not write this riveting read in the Queen's English.  I plan to finish this novel in the coming weeks but it takes entirely too long to hash through it's foreign phrases.<br />This book, like so many other books I read recently and films I've seen, follows a bunch of young men--in this case a rowdy crowd of soccer hooligans--as they engage in their never ending pursuit of the fairer sex.  Their infactuation to get laid--to get &quot;the hole&quot; as Carl says--is a totally consuming vocation as it is with most young men (and alot of older ones too).<br />Terry, the man who gets the most women is--like some character in a James Dean or Brad Pitt movie--a n'er do well whose job is a lowly one: driving a fruit truck.  But he manages to have sex with two different girls in the same house on the same day much to the envy of his friends.  Maybe Irvine Welsh is saying that women are drawn to the trouble makers and the rebels among us.<br />This novel need not have been written in the lingua franca of Scotland.  Philip Roth has shown us that you can write a great novel where all the characters use the same voice and speak in the same style.  You can pepper your narrative with Yiddish, Scottish or whatever, but don't write the whole bloody book in a foreign tongue.	2001-09-26

But in these few pages Franz Kafka serves up an important theme--this is the way humans react when one of their children or parents suffers some medical condition that makes them repulsive to others.  Pity the poor parents who have to raise a child with a serious facial deformity that makes them ugly.  Pity the children whose own parents are suffering a fatal disease.  In both cases, Kafka is saying that the human tendency is to hide the problem or to wish it to go away--i.e. for that pitiful soul to die.  This is ghastly, but perhaps true.  Think of the strain on a marriage when a deformed child is brought into the world--many such marriages don't last.  In the case of the novel the family try to hide their son when he metamorphs into a beatle.  They try to maintain their love for their son but find it impossible because their son's repulsive appearance overwhelms them.  They soon prefer that the beetle, their son, die.  The son's metamorphosis is a metaphor for this paradox faced by families of the sicked or deformed.  Such a theme is deeply disturbing.  But as Voltaire said, if you want to write a great book you must embrace a great theme.	2001-09-26

Having just read \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\" I understand that sentiment.<br />Roth teaches us Gentiles a lot of what it means to be Jewish. He teaches us some Jiddish. He points out the priority that the Jews place on marrying only other Jews. He laments the Jews preoccupation with their 2,000 year old \\"wandering Jew\\" status. And he marvels at the completely Jewish state of the state of Israel.<br />Before I read this novel I knew a little about Jewish culture. I had heard the word \\"goyim\\" (meaning gentiles) before, but \\"shiske\\" I did not know. Evidently it means a female gentile or perhaps a blonde female gentile. Shiskes are important to this novel. Portnoy spends all his energy is pursuit of shiske females must to the consternation of his Jewish parents. In so doing Portnoy attempts to cast of the mantle of his Judaism. Portnoy complains to his Dad that he is tired of \\"being a suffering jew\\". Roth is saying that the Jews cling to their suffering status in order to maintain cohesion in their ranks. And woe to the Jew who tries to marry outside his tribe lest he dilute the race. In the case of Alexander Portnoy's, his family members try to derail his relations with Gentile girls.<br />Philip Roth might have been one of the first \\"great\\" writers I have read to address headlong the theme of men and their compulsion to have sex--either by themselves, as the young Alexander Portnoys compulsion to masturbate, or sex with a female. This topic is the main focus of the book. We've always know that it is true that men think about sex pretty much all day long. But Roth is the first writer I have seen write about this at length.<br />The humour in this novel--yes it is laugh-at-loud funny--left me unprepared for the extreme sadness of Roth's latest novel \\"The Human Stain\\".	2001-09-23

Yet there is another poignant themeFitzgeralds frustration with womenthat will resonate deeply with men who are currently dating.<br />Amory, the main character in the novel who is, of course, Fitzgerald himself, complains that women are quick to jettison real love for a man with real money.  Moreover, he complains of those glittering beauties, their callousness toward men, and the heartbreak they cause.<br />Of one character he writes She is one of those girls who never make the slightest effort to have men fall in love with them.  Two types seldom do: dull men are usually afraid of her clevernessintellectual men are usually afraid of her beauty.<br />The same character is said to [she] treats men terribly.  She abuses them and cuts them and breaks dates with them and yawns in their faces---and they come back for more.  Of course, as a male reader we know both of these ideas to be absolutely true of so many girls and mens behavior too.<br />Writing of his broken relationships and his failure to find a proper muse, Fitzgerland writes Womenof whom he had expected so much; whose beauty he had hoped to transmute into modes of art; whose unfathomable instincts...were all removed by their very beauty, around which men swarmed, from the possibility of contributing anything but a sick heart and a page of puzzled words to write.  The emotional upheaval from broken relations could be the cause of much writers block.<br />The careful reader need not walk away from this lyric prose a misogynist.  Rather Fitzgeralds first novel can be considered a primer on dating for the college-aged man or the divorcee recently reentering the dating market.	2001-08-21

The Corrected Text	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Told backwards like the movie &quot;Memento&quot;	To characterize this novel as a stream-of-consciouness tirade of wayward thought is not entirely fair.  True, Faulkner pencils together one idea after another in an endless series of commas, hyphens, and other grammatical devices save the elusive period (which affords the reader a brief rest).  But to me \\"stream of consciousness\\" means thoughts spilling from the mind of the narrator-ideas that drift about much like own's own mind does-a pattern of thought better kept locked inside one's own skull than spewn forth on the printed page. But Faulkner's endless narrative is not just ambling thoughts-rather it is a detective story-albeit a much more difficult detective story than Faulkner's \\"Sanctuary\\"-where subtle clues and obvious facts are planted deep inside this jumble of sentences. So it's not just musings but is a tightly woven narrative albeit short on periods, white space, and paragraphs.  For that reason the reader better read carefully and not miss a word.<br />\\"Absalom, Absalom\\" reminds me of the recent movie \\"Memento\\".  It is a tale told backwards.  We have the ending given first and then we are given various pieces of the plot from different character's points of view.  We know what happens at the end of the novel before we get there.  But we are not sure why the novel ends as it does until we get to the end.  More accurately, we are given greater clarity to the events that have happened as various narrators and events make other events more clear.  In that regard it's much like \\"The Sound and the Fury\\".  In that novel the story is made clear only when the final narrator has her say.

Girl with a Pearl Earring<br />This novel is reminiscent of the equally popular \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\".  The theme of both books is that beautiful women, especially of an earlier age, are not in control of their destiny with regards to men.  Henry James said exactly that in \\"Portrait of a Lady\\".<br />In the case of \\"The Girl with the Pearl Earring\\", the maid Griet, her beauty attracts the interest of powerful men-in this case the painter Vermeer and his patron.  Tracy Chevalier, the author, gives us clues that their interest is dangerous and could lead to tragedy.  When a gentleman fondles a maid in 1665 the maid cannot offer much resistance owing to her low status in life.  More likely than not, as with Fantine in \\"Les Miserables\\", it is the maiden who is cast into trouble.<br />The beauty of this novel, for a male reader like myself, is that is draws you into the perilous existence inhabited by young women. Prior to this I always thought young women like Griet were just glittering beauties sailing easily through life on their good looks.  It's kind of like reading the diary of a teenage girl-highly guarded and something to which one would not normally be privvy.<br />This novel is erotic too, but in a 17th century demure sort of way.  Griet, we learn, is loath to let her full head of hair be seen by any man and she would never been seen with her lips held open.  When she is intruded upon with her long mane of hair freely unfurled the reader's heart flutters and it must have for the young girl.  And when she moistens her lips and holds them open at the request of the portrait painter Vermeer we are absolutely aghast and tingling with erotic excitement.<br />The other theme of this novel is the brutality of being poor and female in earlier ages.  This is much like \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" where the two sisters are pushed into the business of entertaining men by their impoverished family.  Griet is pushed into working as a maid because her family is poor as well.  The women who work as maids of geishas have a brutal pecking order and are quite cruel to one another.  An unattractive woman in the Geisha household is call \\"Pumpkin\\" because that is the shape of her head.  Griet undergoes similar cruelty by Vermeer's children and the other maids in the large house.<br />For me, the most thrilling parts of the novel are where the young maid Griet is allowed to go into Vermeer's studio.  This creates much jealously in the Vermeer household--not even the painter's wife is allowed into the room where the master creates his masterpieces.  This is what is meant by the book jacket blurb that she is \\"drawn into an artistic wakening\\".  Griet learns the subtlety of light, how to grind various potions from the apotheracy into vivid blues and reds, and the way a painting is made.  It is assembled not by drawing an initial outline as one would imagine.  Rather layer upon layer of color blotches are laid down until the final form takes place.men who work as maids of geishas have a brutal pecking order and are quite cruel to one another.

US	52988307	R1VOK4I01WQC6K	0140431160	461046278	The Life of Samuel Johnson (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	17	24	N	N	Would have enjoyed a cohesive narrative more	I picked up this book after reading that it's style of recording a subject verbatim was mimicked by Lillian Ross in her  famous &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine article on Ernest Hemingway.  Following Ernest Hemingway around with a pad and pencil in hand she simply copied everything that he said over a period of days.  James Boswell used the same approach when he recorded the &quot;Life of Samuel Johnson&quot;.<br />I had always thought of Dr. Samuel Johnson as being the most important literary critic from the 18th century.  At least that is what Harold Bloom, the Yale literary critic, said.  So I was disappointed that Boswell's &quot;Life of Johnson&quot; did not talk too much about literature.  Rather Boswell takes us along as Johnson drinks &quot;copious amounts of wine&quot; and makes fun of the Scotch, the Irish, women, and certain facets of marriage.  This dialogue is entertaining usually.  But when Johnson supports the British class system and attacks the American patriots (this was 1776 after all) I found it annoying.<br />Boswell mentions Johnson's literature but does not delve into it.  He spent some pages talking about Johnson's dictionary that he wrote with the help of two editorial assistants.  (That was quite a feat if you consider that the French dictionnaire of the same period was put together by a team of scholars.)  I would have enjoyed it more if Johnson or Boswell had talked about Boswell's book on Shakespeare, for example.  He only mentions these books as the events surrounding their publication or the King's interest in them intersect with Johnson's life.<br />As other reviewers have pointed out this book is not a biography.  Rather is in a amalagamation of Johnson's visits to his friends and a dialogue of what he said there.  Boswell's sayings are often quoted and those recorded here are sometimes quite famous or funny.  Famous: &quot;One may lead a horse to the water, but twenty cannot make him drink.&quot;  Funny: &quot;I'll come no more behind your scenes, David; for the silk stockings and white bosoms of your actresses excite my amorous propensities&quot;.<br />My one criticism of this book is how it hops from one vignette to another with no continuity between the scenes.  It is a copendium of tales rather than a lengthy dialogue.  That might be why one reviewer said you could dive into it at random and find something worthwhile at every page.e behind your scenes, David; for the silk stockings and white bosoms of your actresses excite my amorous propensities&quot;.<br />My one criticism of this book is how it hops from one vignette to another with no continuity between the scenes.

I picked this book up twice.  The first time I gave up after reading only half.  The second time I got bogged down then hopped onto Amazon.com to read the customer reviews.  Here someone wrote that you should spend sufficient time with the novel and read it with careful concentration.  That was good advice indeed, because the novel then rolled along and became a pleasure to read once I gave it sufficient attention.<br />The first part of the novel is a little annoying.  The unmarried Rosemary pursues the married Dick Diver with complicity from her mother.  Why would her mother encourage her daughter to get involved with a married man?  That part I found frustrating.<br /> I was also confused as to what motivated Dick to marry Nicole.  Some characters in the novel said it was money.  One reviewer here at Amazon.com, whose opinion seems learned, says he did so out of pity for her schizophrenic state.  The novel circles back from the beaches of Cannes and streets of Paris to the mountain hospital where the two characters first met.  At first I found myself backing up and rereading parts of this because the change in venue was so abrupt that it left me somewhat lost.  It was a major shift from the breezy momentum of the early chapters.  But this part of the novel is where the real drama in the story begins to unfold.  So it was a necessary detour.<br />Other reviewers have noted that this novel varies in style from Fitzgerald's other novels.  I read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" for the second time in one sitting.  That novel is more lyrical and rolls along more easily than this one.  There are certain sentences here in \\"Tender is the Night\\" that I wondered how they escaped the careful editing of Maxwell Perkins (editor at Charles Scriber and Sons).<br />Finally fans of Fitzgerald who long to read about rich American expatriates living in Europe will find plenty to entertain them here.  The scenery is the beaches of Cannes, the streets of Paris, and the spas of France.  Nicole and Dick Divers go from one gathering of glitterati to the next.  Fitzgerald drops you squarely into the lives of the idle rich as he did in \\"The Great Gatsby\\".  But here he also reveals a lot about their miseries and heir drunkenness.

Having just read both books I can say that is prime façie obvious.<br />In both novels the main character falls happenstance into the lives of complete strangers and becomes almost a part of their family.  In \\"The Idiot\\" Prince Myshkin claims relations to this family via a distance relative.  In \\"The Last Gentleman\\" the Vaughn family knows Williston Bibb Barrett through Bibb's father who was an important attorney in the South and who knew many people.<br />The character of both novels is beset by a nervous disorder.  For Mr. Barrett--called \\"the engineer\\" because he worked in the boiler room of Macy's department store-it is a something called \\"d&eacute;j&agrave; vu\\".  That means he suffered from lapses in memory, a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu,  depression, and maybe a form of panick attack.  Percy writes \\"Things seemed to turn white and dense and time became freighted with an unspeakable emotion\\".<br />(I think that Walker Percy might also be borrowing from Thomas Mann.  Dostoevsky's Price Myskin returns from a sanatorium at the onset of the novel.  In Mann's \\"The Magic Mountain\\" the setting is a sanatorium and the character Hans Castorp is an engineer as is Mr. Barrett if only in name.)  Both Dostoevsky's Prince Myskin and the Percy's engineer cannot resist blurting out their afflication to whomever they meet. The engineer \\"cannot tell a lie\\".  Both approach their audience with wide-eyed naïvet&eacute;.  I would have thought that some listeners would have been annoyed, but most lend a sympatheti ear.  You find yourself squirming in your seat wishing this pathetic character would not reveal so much of himself.<br />The last glaring similarity between the characters and the plots: the engineer and Price Myskin are able to support themselves with wads of cash handed to them by circumstance.  The engineer keeps coming into money just as he is about to run out. I found that a little annoying and too convenient to carry the plot forward.  But I brushed aside my annoyance and continued to read.<br />The engineer is from an aristocratic family in Mississippi.  He is sent up to Princeton but then drops out later during an attack of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.  He wants to escape to New York City and live a low-stress life.  \\"He envied the janitors\\" says the narrator.  But the Vaughn's find him living in the YMCA and working in a menial job and so take him under their wing.<br />Walker Percy has been called a Southern writer by many critics.  They don't mean he is a writer who lived and worked in the South.  He did that.  Rather they mean his language is whimsical, full of magnolia-and-moonlight imagery, and peppered with references to the Civil War.

I wonder why \\"The Curse of Lono\\" has gone out-of-print.  This book is laugh-out-loud funny and is good journalism.  No, it is great journalism.  So says the experts too: the author's work has been elevated to the classics with one of his books being printed in an Everyman's Library hard-cover edition.  So Hunter S. Thompson joins Oscar Wilde and other great writers.<br />\\"The Curse of Lono\\" made me laugh so hard that tears filled my eyes.  Hunter S. Thompson was paid to cover a marathon race by Rolling Stone or some other magazine.  While the race is the usual bore, the antics of the journalist are not.  Having drunk gallons of beer and liquor and consumed various illegal drugs, Thompson and his traveling companion sit at the edge of the race and jeer on the racers.  \\"He fatso.  What's wrong?  That hill is too steep for you?\\"<br />Flying on a jumbo jet to the race in Hawaii Thompson gets his arm stuck in a chemical toilet.  He put his hand down there because his marijuana, cocaïne, or whatever falls into the toilet bowl.  When he comes out of the head his arm and his shirt and stained bright blue.  The airliner's crew know at once what has happened.<br />The funniest part of the book to me is what happens when Thompson goes fishing.  The captain of the boat drinks a quart of vodka and then takes some mescaline or some other hallucinogenic drug.  A the boat bobs precariously close to the cliffs along the island the captain lets go of the anchor line and it falls overboard.  The captain then dons scuba gear in his tripping, hallucinating state and dives overboard to retrieve it.  As Hunter S. Thompson puts it, \\"No self-respecting captain would return to port without his anchor\\" for fear of being laughed at.<br />All of this talk of drugs and drink might be pathetic or sad if it was not handled properly.  But Thompson is the founder-and maybe only participant in-the style of writing and journalism that he calls \\"gonzo journalism\\".  His style is truly unique.  I became convinced of his genius after reading \\"Fear and Lothing in Las Vegas\\", another drunken, stoned adventure tale and a memoir that he wrote in \\"The New Yorker\\" magazine.  His New Yorker article deviating from his usual tone-perhaps owing to it's presence in that hallowed forum--was a well-written and very interesting look at his days living in Puerto Rico as a journalist.

Books	4	16	17	N	N	History of Communism from the great literary critic	Edmund Wilson's \\"To The Finland Station\\" is a history of communism from Michelet to Lenin.  Well that's not exactly correct-this book is many books rolled into one.  First it is a history of the idea of a Marxist interpretation of history.  Second it is a first-hand account of the efforts by Marx and Engels to start a communist revolution.  Third it is a literary criticism of \\"Das Kapital\\", the books of Michelet and other writers.<br />Edmund Wilson was the book reviewer for \\"The New Yorker\\" magazine for many years.  I picked up this book wanting to read something, anything from the literary critic who many consider the finest since, say, Samuel Johnson.  Wilson is famous for, among other things, writing about the literature of the Civil War, \\"Patriotic Gore\\", and learning Hebrew so that he could write \\"The Dead Sea Scrolls\\".  (He must have understood French and German too since he seems to have read Michelet and Marx in the original.)  Wilson was also notorious for panning \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" and all mystery writing in general.  Perhaps his greatest contribution was to revive from obscurity and make famous the writing of F. Scott Fitzgerald, author of \\"The Great Gatsby\\", who books had gone out of print.<br />\\"To the Finland Station\\" is a long book that is often difficult to read.  The long discussion of Hegel and Dialectical Materialism-while no doubt important to the idea of a Marxist interpretation of history-had me rereading the same paragraphs over and over.  Still I don't understand any of it.  But the terse nature of this prose and the theories they contain render one of the most startling ideas in the book.  Marx says that most shallow readers-I guess he had me in mind-have missed the idea of communism completely.  It is not simply the progression from capitalism to a struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois.<br />Wilson writes that Marx says \\"To many simple minded persons who have just heard about Marxism, it means something extremely simple: it means that people always act from motives of economic interest and the everything that everything mankind has thought or done is susceptible of being explained in those terms\\".  Yes, that is my precise understanding of Marxism and I learned it in high school.<br />Until I read this book I did not know that Marx and Engels were not just pointy headed intellectuals working away in the safety of a university.  No, they were front-line politicians and revolutionaries who risked their necks and their money to foment revolution.  As Wilson points out, Marx used his inherited money to buy weapons for revolutionaries in Belgium.  Both were expelled from Belgium, Prussia, France, and Marx finally settled in London.  He and Engels spent much of their efforts trying re-ignite the Paris Commune (a French civil war in the 1870's where the communists actually took Paris for a few days) in revolutions in Austria and elsewhere.<br />It is interesting to note that capitalism and the lack of money caused Marx and his family great suffering.  Marx was broke during most of his life in London.  He and his family were evicted from their homes even while Mrs. Engles was suckling her child.  The child later died.  Marx made a little money writing articles for newspapers such as Horace Greeley's New York City newspaper \\"The World\\".  But he mainly lived off charity from Engles and financial bailouts from Lasalle.  Lasalle was another revolutionary.  Marx was jealous of any rival to his position as leader of the movement.  Engels was jealous of any rival to the affections of Marx.<br />For me the most interesting character in the book is Jules Michelet.  Wilson takes you into his study as he labors away at his great \\"History of the French Revolution\\".  Michelet was lucky to have been the first historian granted access to the French version of the national archives.  (I think he founded the Academie Française?)  Michelet today might be best known for popularizing the feats of the young French maiden, Jean D'Arc.<br />Other extremely interesting sections of the book were descriptions of early efforts to build idealistic communistic communes in the young country, The United States.  All of these efforts failed.  The most famous were the Brook Farm and others based on the writing of Fourier.  (You can read Susan Sontag's \\"In America\\" for a description of one such commune.)  I did not know that early efforts at communism were launched right here in the USA.  Fancy that!<br />To his credit Edmund Wilson went back into his book years after it's publication and wrote a new introduction.  There he derides the evils of Stalinism.  While it's conception might have been pure and elegant like some subtle mathematical proof-to the writer Saint Simon communism was even a new religion--it's implementation was bloody and ridiculous.  Today most people would agree that it has been totally discredited.

Having just finished this book I wonder why?  It is a goodbook, but not a great one.<br />Another reviewer here attacked `InAmerica' because it did not have much plot.  That reviewer might becomplaining that long passages of the book are letters and excerptsfrom a diary laid out in chronological order.  It is true this is nota fast-moving page-turner, but plot is not why one usually readsSontag.  Rather the insight that is typical of Sontag's book-lengthessays is what you would expect to find in her novel.<br />If there isanything insightful here it must in the in the interplay between thethree major characters in the novel. They are the famous Polishactress Maryna, her husband Bogdan, and her bachelor friend Rysard.<br />The opening scene of the novel is so far fetched as to be not evenbelievable.  We are at a cocktail party in Poland. An unnamednarrator, who does not speak of world of Polish, relates what ishappening.  Yet she claims to understand the events that transpirearound her.  That is ridiculous and annoying.<br />From this oddbeginning the novel picks up speed and becomes more interesting.Maryna surmises that she cannot remain at the pinnacle of Polishtheater forever.  She wonders, `The public is fickle.  My public wantsto love a newer, younger face.'  This is her reason she wants to quitPoland and move to America.  She gathers together her retinue afriend who is a painter, a doctor, and other hangers-on andretreats to the mountains.  There most of her circle decides to moveto the New World and establish a commune.<br />The commune is establishedin Anaheim, California.  At that time (19th century) the countrysidewas mostly empty having been recently settled by German immigrants.The farm that Maryna and her friends establish is called a `commune'by some other book reviewers.  But to me it seems that Maryna was ableto convince her friends to move with her largely by the weight of herpersonality.  I did not find that she said `let's establish acommunistic commune'.  Yet that is exactly what her neighbors did inSouthern California.  There were several patterned on the Brook Farmand the writings of Fourier.  These were true communistic ventureswhose plight and origins are described by Edmund Wilson in `To theFinland Station'.<br />Maryna is pursued across Poland and then inAmerica by her writer friend Rysard.  He writes articles on the Polishactress and on his own journey to America for Polish newspapers.Rysard seeks the love of Maryna.  (It appears they were loversbefore.) Maryna's husband for reasons that I never learned evenencourages them to travel to San Francisco together.  Would you sendyou wife off with someone who was seeking her affection?<br />Maryna leftthe commune she had established and moved to San Francisco to seek toreenter the theatre.  Her main motive appears that the commune wasrunning out of cash, but she also wants to prove that she can succeedin the English-speaking American theater.  The commune falls apartwhen the `expatriate intellectuals' as they callthemselves prove inept at making a living growing grapes.  Therewere also domestic difficulties such as perennial fights between oneof the married couples there.  Each commune dweller drifted away forhis or her own reason.<br />Maryna says `Every marriage, every communityis a failed utopia. Utopia is not a kind of place but a kind of time, those all too brief moments when one would not wish to be anywhere else.'<br />Anyway, as other reviewers have already pointed out, Maryna returns to the theatre and triumphs.  This return did not seem so triumphant as it was written by Sontag at the onset.  It appeared more happenstance.  But later descriptions of Maryna on-stage and the resultant accolades make the reader more convinced that Maryna deserves to be called a great actress.<br />The character Rysard might be Susan Sontag's alter ego.  Rysard, the writer, says that he cannot standpeople, but the love of people is required in order to be a writer.  Rysard makes several other comments on the craft of writing that perhaps come from the opinions of Susan Sontag.d people, but the love of people is required in order to be a writer.

I just reread this novel for the second time hoping to gain a greater understanding of it.  Like other reviewers have pointed out, Percy's work tends to be heavily weighted with philosophical or psychological overtones.  (Not being well-read or trained in such areas I found no such theme to comment on.) One Percy scholar even said that the philosophical foundations for this novel were laid in Percy's essay \\"The Man on the Train: Three Existential Modes\\".  A train is obviously prominent in \\"The Moviegoer\\".  But regarding existentialism I haven't a clue what that means so I don't know if you will find any such themes in the novel.<br />Other reviewers have already laid out the plot of \\"The Moviegoer\\" for you.  Binx Bolling idles through life on some kind of search the target of which is never made clear.  As he happens along he notices malaise all about him and despair.  Binx himself is in a kind of funk and the character Kate suffers a more serious depression.  A quote from Kierkegaard  in the front of the book signals the importance of this theme: \\"...the specific character of despair is precisely this: it is unaware of being despair.\\"<br />When he is not selling stocks, Binx spends his time in pursuit of female company.  Binx says: \\"For some years now I have had no friends.  I spend my entire time working, making money, going to movies, and seeking the company of women.\\"<br />The most lyrical sections of the novel are where Percy describes the various targets of Binx Bolling's lust: \\"She is a strapping girl but by no means too big, done up head to toe in cellophane, the hood pushed back to show a helmet of glossy black hair.  She is magnificent with her split tooth and her Price Val bangs split on her forehead.\\"  One's heart flutters as the girl gets off the city bus and is forever gone out Bink Bolling's life.<br />Walker Percy's friend and mentor Shelby Foote (they went to school together at UNC) thought that \\"The Moviegoer\\" had one fault and that \\"it's so big you can't do anything about it\\".  Writing in a letter to his friend he wrote: \\"The last third gets so caught up in the story ... that it changes in tone as well.  For one thing your hero is no longer a moviegoer.\\"  I am inclined to agree.  Early in the novel Percy sends Binx into the movie theater to show him as someone who is a loner.  He even spies a movie star on the street of New Orleans, where the novel is set.  But in the end the Moviegoer only sees one film and that is with a female companion.  Perhaps the title \\"The Moviegoer\\" makes that idea too prominent.

Writing in a letter to his friend he wrote: \\"The last third gets so caught up in the story ... that it changes in tone as well.

He even spies a movie star on the street of New Orleans, where the novel is set.  But in the end the Moviegoer only sees one film and that is with a female companion.

US	52988307	R6F1ARVNDI65B	0486264645	489174445	Heart of Darkness (Dover Thrift Editions)	Books	4	0	2	N	N	The surreal fiefdom of Kurtz	Having read the other reviews written here, I expected \\"Heart of Darkness\\" to be primarily about Howard Kurtz and his surreal fiefdom located along the shore of the Congo River.  But we only get to meet Kurtz toward the end of this book.  In the rest of the novel the narrator, a sailor named Marlow, circles about the subject of Kurtz by talking with people who only talk about Kurtz or their efforts to reach him.<br />This novel will be a shock to the modern reader who is not used to the anachronistic racial stereotypes and blunt language found in \\"Mark Twain\\", \\"Candide\\", or other.  Conrad calls the blacks of Africa \\"savages\\" and describes their comings and goings as a \\"wriggling mass of black arms\\".  In \\"Heart of Darkness\\" we also see the stereotypical native with a bone through his nose-it's just like Edgar Rice Burrows's \\"Tarzan\\".<br />Conrad mentions the blacks with hostility and talks of them as if they could not be real people.  But he backs away from this callousness and speaks admirably of the helmsman of the steamer.  He says that the heretofore-ignorant sailor became a loyal trusted aid with a big heart.  Maybe Conrad is saying something about the merits of colonialism here.  Regarding physical beauty, Conrad is enamored with the vision of a black woman who is evidently Kurt'z mistress.  In these two characters we see that Conrad has mixed feelings toward the blacks.<br />Another reviewer wrote of the metaphors that fill so many sentences.  Conrad also deploys a lot of symbolism.  That Kurtz's aide de campe was dressed like a Harlequin reminded me of Picasso's many portraits of a boy dressed similarly dressed.  And the phrase \\"Heart of Darkness\\" is used repeatedly throughout.  I believe it's meaning varies from one instance to the next.  Prima façie it just means the obvious: Kurt'z camp is located in the middle of previously unknown and hostile country, a void.  The narrator Marlow himself mentions this when recalled looking wistfully over maps of the world with huge unknown holes drawn into them.<br />Chinua Achebe, author of \\"Things Fall Apart\\", wrote in an essay on \\"Heart of Darkness\\" that Europeans have traditionally used Africa as a \\"foil\\" the comparison with which makes their own accomplishments seem grander.  His novel is, of course, an attack on colonialism itself.<br />\\"Heart of Darkness\\" is about a journey into the Belgian Colony of the Congo. As you might know, Congo was renamed \\"Zaire\\" by the dictator Robert Mugabe.  The warlord Laurent Kabila deposed Mugaba and now presides over its war with neighboring Rhawanda.<br />For an up-to-date travelogue of Africa I recommend Shrinivas Naipal's memoir of Africa \\"East to West\\".  He mentions \\"Heart of Darkness\\" frequently.  I believe he see his trip as the \\"Heart of Darkness\\" journey revisited 100 years later.world with huge unknown holes drawn into them. <br />Chinua Achebe, author of \\"Things Fall Apart\\", wrote in an essay on \\"Heart of Darkness\\" that Europeans have traditionally used Africa as a \\"foil\\" the comparison with which makes their own accomplishments seem grander.

US	52988307	R24TCPR8PL8Y2V	0553580930	101241499	A Man in Full	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Great novel even if John Updike says not	Alanta, Georgia stars in Tom Wolfe's latest novel, A Man in Full. This book, already nominated for a National Book Award, follows Mr. Wolfe's other blockbuster novels Bonfire of the Vanities and The Right Stuff.<br />The main character in Tom Wolfe's novel is Charlie Croker, a 250 pound former Georgia Tech football player turned real estate developer. Charlie is a provincial Donald Trump.  At Georgia Tech, Charlie was called the 60 Minute Man because he played both offense and defense for the full 60 minute game.<br />Atlanta is like no other city in the South since it lacks much historical lore. It is not old and decorated with stately 200-yeard old mansions like Charleston, Savannah, or Richmond. Anything antique in Atlanta was long ago razed to make way for a myriad of gleaming glass office towers.<br />While the harmony between white businessmen and black citizens is good, in Atlanta blacks and whites live apart like they do in most American cities. But unlike most cities, in Atlanta blacks thoroughly control local politics, because 75% of the voting population is black. They proudly refer to their home as the Chocolate Mecca. Consequently all the political power is vested squarely in their hands.<br />At the pinnacle of black society are the Spellman and Morehouse college elite such as the attorney Roger White, another major character in the novel. At school, Roger White earned the nickname &quot;Roger Too White&quot; from his college classmates. This refers to his flawless dress, interest in classical music, and impeccable English free of black colloquialisms.<br />Through Roger Too White, we learn several heretofore well-kept secrets of black society. Roger White is also a member of another privileged circle. These are black people who can pass the so-called &quot;paper bag test&quot;. These are black people whose skin color is no darker than a brown paper bag.<br />The main character Charlie Croker is a down-home country fellow who has made a pile of money in the real estate business. He spends it lavishly on toys like a Gulfstream V jet and a 28,000 acre quail-hunting plantation. The stewardess of his jet is a shapely honey named Peaches. Only in Georgia-the self-proclaimed Peach State--would you find a mouth-watering bimbo sporting that name.<br />Charlie Croker dumped his wife of many years to marry a 20-something trophy wife. Together they live in the most fashionable of Atlanta neighborhoods: Buckhead. In Buckhead the grass is greener and the air is cooler than in the southern and eastern sections of the town where the blacks live. As a matter of fact, it is cooler and greener than Chamblee-now called &quot;Chambodia&quot; because of all the Asians-and the lilly white suburbs that surround the city too.<br />In describing Turmptime, Charlie's quail hunting preserve, Wolfe is accurate in his description of a Southern plantation.  The Southern Plantation culture still thrives albeit as a recluse for the wealthy sportsman. But Tom Wolfe picked the wrong sport in my opinion. It is true that some hunters prefer quail. But the truly rich folk buy southern plantations so that they can hunt ducks.<br />Each of the recent Tom Wolfe novels have added new phrases to the English language. The title to The Right Stuff has come to mean someone who has the wherewithal to conquer the toughest of assignments such as space flight. The major character in Bonfire of the Vanities is a &quot;Master of the Universe&quot;. This is someone, like the protagonist millionaire bond trader, who is an absolute master of his own destiny and holds the world at bay. No such phrase jumps out at you when you read A Man in Full unless you consider the phrase &quot;commuterburbs&quot;. These are the suburbs that ring all major American cities-Wolfe singles out Snellville, Georgia. These are featureless towns where the bourgeois classes live and make the daily, grueling commute to the big city to work.<br />The other major character in A Man in Full isFareek Fannon, Georgia Tech's star running back. He comes from the the squalor of a ghetto in southern Atlanta. Fareek faces a predicament that lets Wolfe further explore the delicate subject of race relations in Atlanta. Fareek is accused by a Georgia Tech coed of rape during the annual week of partying by black college students known as Freaknik.<br />Freaknik is a week-long party in Atlanta where black college students from across the country gather to engage in the same sort of debauchery that white colleges students pursue in Fort Lauderdale during Spring Break. But while the occasions are similar, Wolfe points out that the in-your-face attitude of the black students makes the white Atlantans quite uncomfortable.<br />Some white business leaders have sought to rein in the Freaknik festvitity. Of course, the blacks have said such crowd control strategies are rooted in racism. Wolfe illustrates this point perfectly when he describes a bare-midriffed black beauty wildly gyrated her body atop a car in stopped-dead traffic on Peachtree street. Her dance takes place in front of the staid all-white, Old South Piedmont Driving Club. The black woman dances while the rap lyrics &quot;Ram-Yo-Booty&quot; blare from the car's speaker. Regardless of how open-minded and liberal you purport to be, the pleasure gained from the lyrics &quot;Ram-Yo-Booty&quot; is not understood by anyone in the white community. Quite the contrary, this music suggests a militancy that threatens the same people.<br />The novel's plot unwinds as that attorney Roger Too White and the Atlanta Mayor, Wesley Jordan, conspire with Charlie Croker to create a deal that will save Fareek Fanon, the football start, from the rape accusation and save the city from a resultant race riot. The black civic leaders and the white business interests want to keep race relations in Atlanta humming along in The Atlanta Way.ll is Fareek Fannon, Georgia Tech's star running back.

It tells the story of a bewildered little boy who suddenly becomes a fabulously wealthy count.  There is a hush across the room as this nephew is brought into his uncle's house and had the title of count foisted upon him. The reader, like the former count's hangers-on, are awed by this saintly presence and mightily impressed with his new-found wealth.<br />The youngcount, an aristocract whose life I assume is based on the true situation in Csarist Russia, lead a life of unimaginable wealth.  The count was an important private person who served a crucial role in government.  His many estates were so vast that they had their own hospitals and schools.  The count had so many people in his employ that when the country went to war the count and other aristocrats were expected to summon their own divisions to join the army.  Regarding war, the count became a Freemason.  These are a group of Christians who are opposed to war.  (I imagine that modern-day Masons and maybe Quakerism sprang from this movement.)  So late in the novel we witness the scene of the unarmed count wandered the Russian battlefield where Napolean's army has just been engaged.  Leo Tolstoy, the author, was a freemason as well.<br />War and Peace is so long that it's length has become a clich&eacute;.  It takes well 100 pages for one character  (I won't give his name and ruin the novel for you) to die.  But it is a fabulous 100 pages and holds your interest.  We watch that character crawl into bed and slowly begin to die.  The light in his eyes glows dimmer and his life is slowly snuffed out.  When I read that I felt a heavy burden bear down on me until it pushed be into a kid of sad calm.<br />This book is a great novel but also an important work of history.  Its historical import comes from it's discussion of the war with Napoleon and the life of the Russian aristocrat.<br />The princes, counts, nieces, and nephews in the novel glide from one ball to another it seems.  In this regard the novel is reminiscent of Tolstoy's novel \\"Anna Karenina\\".  It seems the young females in the novel lived exclusively for these grand formal dances.<br />Even though the aristocrats in the novel are Russia they did not speak Russian.  Rather they spoke French, because that is what Russian aristrocrats did.  Another interesting point: the women in the novel have a slightly different last name from their spouse.  It is diminutive of their husband's last name. I am not sure if that is why the practice was followed, but it is certainly more elegant sounding than the current fashion e.g. \\"Hillary Rodman-Clinton\\".<br />In case you haven't heard this yet, Leo Tolstoy, the author, was an aristocrat himself who foreswore all his worldly goods and lived his waning days piously as a recluse in quiet contemplation.  This was much to the consternation of his family.<br />If you have not seen it I also recommend \\"Woody Allen's\\" cinematic parody of the novel \\"Love and Death\\".  This is not the first time that Woody Allen has taken a great work of literature or philosopy as his theme..  In this regard the novel is reminiscent of Tolstoy's novel \\"Anna Karenina\\".

Like the other reviews here say, Nat Turner led the only somewhat successful slave rebellion in the South.<br />William Styron was very brave to write this book.  And he was much pilloried by Black intellectuals for having done so.<br />The novel is beautiful written and the prose is lyric.  We are drawn into Nat's life, the life of the slaves around him, and his masters.  They taught Nat to read and treated him kindly.  So it is with unexpected horror that we see him lead the blacks there in Virginia to rebel against and hack apart their masters with axes.  According to Styron, Turner never butchered anyone.  But he lost control of his rebel army and stood by as his owners and friends were hacked to pieces by the most violent slaves.  That is the great irony depicted by the novel.  On minute we have peaceful chariot rides with the mistress of the plantation.  The next we have brutal decapitation. The reason that Turner rose up in rebellion is never clearly explained.  The reader is left to draw his own conclusion.  That men can turn to monsters is very much thematic here.<br />I think what upset the black intellectuals so much was that William Styron broke two taboos.  First he depicted the slave owners in this novel as benevolent-there is not supposed to be any possibility of that so say the revisionists.  (Styron points out that slaves in the cotton fields of Missippi suffered more.  Farming in Virginia was not so large-scale so the work was or a different nature.)  But perhaps Styron's greater sin was describing in vivid detail Nat Turner's affection for a white female.  That this part of the novel was made up and that is touched on an unmentionable taboo got Sytron into much trouble.  A group of black intellectuals wrote essays that attacked Styron's novel.  Sytron could not understand their dismay and was hurt by their assault.  I cannot remember if James Baldwin was among the vengeful.  I know that he and Styron were friends.assault.

In the novel the character &quot;K.&quot; is arrested for a crime the nature of which is never explained to him.  K. must live each day with the burden of his supposed guilt.  Day after day he is hounded by the courts in a process that rolls on with no apparent logic carrying it along.  The burden of this wears the character down until it becomes almost unbearable...<br />My favorite scene in the novel is where K. goes to the court to seek the ear of the magistrate.  Hours go by as the court ever so slowly deals with case after case.  K.'s case seems lost in the docket and we despair with him.<br />&quot;The Trial&quot; is just like another Kafka's novel &quot;The Castle&quot;.  There a character, also named K., tries without success to see a city leader with whom he has a supposed contract to do some work.  The reader and the character anguish at the mindless nature of the obstacles put up in his path. K. never gets to see the city official and Kafka seems to give up in despair too when he leaves the novel unfinished.  In &quot;The Trial&quot; we try to cast off the mindless bureaucracy.  In &quot;The Castle&quot; we try to navigate it.<br />The situation in both novels is absurd. The keyword here is &quot;absurb&quot; and has been latched onto by Kafka devot&eacute;es.  In Praque there is a theater called &quot;Theater of the Absurd&quot; where I saw two of Vaclav Havel's plays.  No doubt this name is homage to Franz Kafka and his work.  I am sure that Kafka influenced Havel.  The word &quot;Kafkaesque&quot; has also been added to the language courtesy of Kafka.  It has come to symbolize any extremely mindless matter or ludicrous situation.  The whole of Chech culture under communism was an absurdity that was cleverly forecast by Franz Kafka himself.  This was what Vaclav Havel wrote about in his plays and essays.<br />Some people might find &quot;The Trial&quot; a little difficult to read.  Paragraphs consume whole pages.  There is very little dialogue which, in my mind, makes it easier to follow.  Still I read it twice-not to understand it better but to enjoy it once again.<br />Kafka wrote his novel in German.  This is somewhat remarkable because he was a Jew living in Chechoslovakia.  You would think that he would have written in Yiddish or Chech.  That his novel was written in German maybe helped him gain a wider audience in the West.

Most people know his as a writer of books on the Civil War.  But when you read this book of letters you see that what thrilled him most was reading great literature.<br />The reader of this book of letters between two friends will be thrilled by talk of literature.  Foote is like Herr Settembrini of Thomas Mann's &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;.  He is so overwhelmed by humantistic learning that he finds he must educate his friend and mentor Hans Castrop, in this case Walker Percy.<br />It is ironic that the prodigy in this case, Walker Percy, soon eclipses the mentor.  Walker Percy agonizes in his early letters about his inability to have his novels published while Foote publishes his books in rapid succession.  But today Percy's &quot;Moviegoer&quot; and other books are still read while only Foote's &quot;Shiloh&quot; is really still popular.  It seems Foote is stuck with Civil War fame have written his long classic on the war.<br />Reading Foote's letters is where I discovered Flanney O'Connor.  Walker Percy and Shelby Foote spoke highly of her here.  They also talk about the important of reading Marcel Proust, Faulkner, and a dozen others.  Toward the end Foote begins to spew forth on the merits of reading the Greek classics.  It is his description of these books and their authors that adds to one's own literary education.<br />The first part of the book is a little annoying because Shelby Foote threw away the letters that Walker Percy sent to him for the first many years of their correspondence.  So you keep reading Shelby Foote but are not privvy to what Walker Percy as to say.	2000-10-02

In addition to being a personal memoir this book is a technical description of the techniques that are used in swordfishing from the tackle that is engaged to techniques used to navigate the ocean.<br />I found the author's description of how you navigate to the fishing grounds an interesting read.  This part of the book reminds me of long sections on celestial navigation found in William F. Buckley's books on sailing.  In reading both sometimes you have to back up and reread paragraphs so you can make sure you understand the geometry that is explained.  It is this mastery of the ebb and flow of the ocean currents, the finer points of navigation, and an understanding of the electronics on board that makes Linda Greenlaw able to find the best fishing spots.  And she claims to be the best fisherman in the fleet.<br />As the author Linda Greenlaw explains she uses transducers and transponders that can measure the water temperature at both the surface and a dozen fathoms beneath the sea.  Then she uses doppler radar to calculate how fast currents below the surface are running in relation to the surface itself.  She writes down all of this in her journal plus the positions of the other boats in the fleet and the locations of the 40 miles of fishing line each has floating free in the ocean.  Then she considers the winds, the stage of the moon, and the rising weather to find a place and a time to set her tackle.  Keeping track of all these many variables allows the reader to participate in the strategy, the successes, and the setbacks that accompany the fishing trip.<br />I wonder if Linda Greenlaw's friends in the swordfishing fleet will be peeved that she gave away so many of their secrets in this book.  As she points out there is a gently rivalry between boat captains that cause them to keep secret information on where the fish are located and how to catch them.  Armed with the technical minutiae in this book, the ordinary lobster or crab fisherman could travel to the Grand Banks and start catching something more lucrative than crabs or lobsters, namely swordfish.<br />If you read \\"The Hungry Ocean\\" you should also read \\"Giant Bluefin\\" by Douglas Whynott.  And I also recommend any of the numerous fishing books written by Zane Grey, author of \\"The Riders of the Purple Sage\\". Ernest Hemingway's \\"Islands in the Stream\\" is about fishing for billfish as well.h the technical minutiae in this book, the ordinary lobster or crab fisherman could travel to the Grand Banks and start catching something more lucrative than crabs or lobsters, namely swordfish.<br />If you read \\"The Hungry Ocean\\" you should also read \\"Giant Bluefin\\" by Douglas Whynott.

The river here is the Santee.  (When Mr. Rutledge was young the Santee was a greater river than today, because in the 1930's much of it's flow was diverted to the Cooper River and Charleston when dams were built upstream in Berkley County.)<br />Hampton is no longer a plantation-the Civil War put and end to that-but when Archibald lived there it still had all the requisite amenities: a Greco-style mansion with porticos and widows walk,  rice fields with floodgates and dikes, and acres of pines and hardwoods forest.  Some of the blacks who lived on or near Hampton and who worked there had been Hampton slaves in their youth.<br />Hamton Plantation fell into disrepair during the 30 plus years that Archibald Rutledge lived in Pennsylvania where he worked as a school teacher.  Much of this book describes his efforts to restore Hampton to its former splendor.<br />One can imagine Hampton in it's heyday when the mover and shakers of Colonial and ante-bellum society frequented the plantation.  Great piles of ham, turkey, and duck greeted George Washington, the Marquis de Lafeyette, and other visitors.  It seems General George Washington and his French military peer stayed in every notable house along the Carolina coast.  There are signs all over reading \\"George Washington\\" slept here. I read about a Lafayette visit in a history of Edisto Island.  South Carolinians are guilty of ostentatious name dropping when it comes to the father of our country.  It is a point of which we are obviously proud.<br />Archibald Rutledge didn't have a lot of money to rebuild Hampton.  (I wonder how he paid the taxes on several thousand acres of land on a teacher's pension and meager book royalties.  The tax bill handed over to his heirs must be one reason the land now belongs to the state.)  Yet archibald restored each dusty room of Hampton with the help of local carpenters and back-breaking work.  We see the old history of the mansion revealed to us layer by layer as he peels away plaster and paint.<br />I found most enjoyable the sections of the book on hunting and gardening. Archibald Rutledge was a writer and poet whose hunting stories were printed in Field and Stream magazine.  He also wrote for Harpers and the Saturday Evening Post.  That hunting remains popular while poetry does not must account for the longevity of his printed material.  Had he only written poetry his work might have fallen into obscurity-this is not to say it is not good.  Rather, people simply don't revere poets like the used to.  (Quick: name two poems by Robert Frost.  How about Wallace Stevens?)<br />I read carefully as Archibald Rutledge describes how he carefully transplanted live oak trees, myrtle bushes, and planted azaleas and camellias around Hampton.  He describes the tricks he discovered for making these plants thrive and survive relocation.  Botanists take note.  Live oaks adorned with Spanish Moss, myrtle bushes, azaleas, and camellias are the foliage that defined the Carolina coast. Their great beauty was much appreciated at Hampton.<br />Of course hunting was Archibald Rutledge's passion and this is where the sports enthusiast will enjoy \\"Home by the River\\" most.  I read with envy his description of great clouds of ducks as they flew up out of his rice fields.  (These great clouds are still there albeit diminished by market hunting which has since been outlawed and wetlands destruction which has been outlawed as well.  Most of the ducks still on the Santee River flock to the government-owned Santee Gun club where they are relatively safe from the average hunter who is without political connections.  There is much to be said about this government hoarding of ducks I believe.)<br />Archibald Rutledge hunted turkeys in the fall.  Now we hunt turkeys in the spring because that is when the old toms gobble seeking to mate.  Such relatively easy prey seemed unsporting in Archibald's day.

This book is a series of essays by the<br />dissident Vaclav Havel that were smuggled out of communist<br />Czechoslovakia and translated by a Havel friend in the West.  Vaclav<br />Havel was a playwright who became a Czech dissident who became leader<br />of the Velvet revolution (which ousted the communists) and who finally<br />became president of the republic.<br />Vaclav Havel was the foremost<br />dissident under the communist regime.  He openly challenged the ruling<br />government with such essays as \\"Power to the Powerless\\" and<br />\\"The Soul of Main under Communism\\".  (Actually I forgot the name<br />of the latter essay.  I think \\"The Soul of Man under Communism\\"<br />is an essay written by Oscar Wilde. But Havel did address this theme<br />in \\"Disturbing the Peace\\" and in essays he forwarded to the<br />communist rulers.)<br />One of the most exciting parts of the book is<br />where Havel describes the dissident communitie's efforts to publish a<br />Havel essay advocating that the Czech government adhere to the terms<br />of the Charter 77 human rights accord to which they were a signatory.<br />The story is spine tingling thriller complete with car chases and<br />obscure drop points.  It reads like a John le Carre novel except it is<br />real.<br />After you read \\"Disturbing to Peace\\" I also recommend<br />\\"The Magic Lanten\\" by Timothy Garton Ash.  This is a first hand<br />account of the fall of the communism as the democratic revolution<br />rolled across Czechoslovakia, East German, Hungary, and Romania.<br />Garton Ash was privy to the inner circle of people who plotted and<br />executed these bloodless coups. (Bloodless everywhere except, of<br />course, in Romania.)	2000-10-02
US	52988307	REROQLVIZX4Z1	0553268937	175069368	The Water Is Wide	Books	4	16	25	N	N	Yamacraw is a precursor to the rest of Conroy's Books	Somebody else already attacked the other reviewer for calling this book a novel.  This memoir is fact.  But the other writer wrote that Pat Conroy went to Yamacraw Island to fight &quot;institutional racism&quot;, blah, blah, blah.  That misses the point entirely.<br />Pat Conroy was a native of the South Carolina coast.  Being a writer he took the job of being a school teacher at Yamacraw because he wanted to teach.  That would give him time to write.  And living on Yamacraw would give him something to write about.<br />Pat Conroy is the author of &quot;The Lords of Discipline&quot; , &quot;The Great Santini&quot;,  &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot;, and &quot;Beach Music&quot;.  Fans of these novels should add &quot;The Water is Wide&quot; to their bookshelves.<br />In this memoir the young Pat Conroy takes a job teaching black children on Yamacraw Island.  There is no road there so he takes a boat to work each day.  The school kids are pretty much illiterate.  Complicit in the neglect of the school-from a materiel point of view-is the headmistress.  Representing the status quo do-nothing school board, she is just like the matron in George Orwell's novel &quot;The Clergyman's Daughter&quot;.  Just like in the same novel, Pat Controy, the bright new school teacher, comes along with some new ideas and is able to achieve some positive results in the classroom.  The bureaucrat in the way laments Conroy's efforts.  She says he should just beat them.  That's the only way to instill discipline she says.<br />I think that Pat Conroy might have come to Yamacraw to live the contemplative live of a writer.  But he soon is embroiled in controversy and busy fending off the headmistress and bewildered parents.  But his skill as a teacher is he is able to mollify his critics.  The apogee of his success is when he organizes his retinue for a field trip to Savannah.  This is one of the most enjoyable and most worrisome parts of the book as he and the kids have a great trip, but Conroy must jump through hoops to get the requisite signatures from all of the parents.  For some of the kids this is a their first trip off the Island.<br />One should not look upon the people of Yamacraw with pity as I am sure Pat Conroy did not.  What ruined their lifestyle, he clearly points, out is the pollution of the Savannah River which wiped out the crab population there and the islander's livelihood.  (Probably the crabs have rebounded now with the Clear Water act and other efforts to curtail nitrogen and other emissions.)  Rather Conroy's look at the Island is whimsical-i.e. he has a fondness for the winding creek and the expanse of marshes, the live oak forests, and the simple life of the agrarian dweller.  He genuinely grows fond the of kids under his kids.  As was his goal, all of this provided greater fodder for his memoir.<br />The only criticism I have of Pat Conroy is he seems to have strayed from literature and gone commercial.  &quot;The Lords of Discipline&quot; was a great yarn about life at the Citadel.  But I refused to read &quot;Beach Music&quot; because it seemed to use the same backdrop of South Carolina as a setting and theme one time too many.  Not being a writer with the skills of Faulkner-who kept his focus on one tiny county in Missippi-I think Conroy could have gone elsewhere after he wrote &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot;.  Maybe he is one of these writers like Tom Wolfe (of Asheville and not the Richmond writer) who can only write autobiographical books.oy must jump through hoops to get the requisite signatures from all of the parents.

US	52988307	R1J9VENF1HKSUY	0140269444	284195738	News of a Kidnapping: From the Nobel Laureate, the International Bestseller That Takes Us into the Horrific World of the Medellin Drug Cartel (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)	Books	4	7	10	N	N	Good journalism from a great fiction writer	Gabriel Garcia Marquez's \\"News of a Kidnapping\\" is a non-fiction work of journalism.  This is unusual in that Se&ntilde;or Gabo, as he is known by his Colombia countrymen, usually writes fiction.  Of course, he is best known as the nobel-prize winning author of the novels \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\", \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\", and \\"The General in his Labyrinth\\".  This fiction has been called \\"magical realism\\".<br />\\"News of a Kidnapping\\" was translated by Edith Grossman.  She translated all the Marquez novels listed above and has been praised by the author.<br />\\"News of a Kidnapping\\" tells the tales of the kidnapping of a dozen or so Colombian citizens by the drug lords who came to be called the \\"extraditables\\".  That name is no longer in the news since Pablo Escobar and other kingpins have been killed and the drug cartels broken into smaller groups including the guerrilla army which is, of course, no small group at all.  The \\"extraditables\\" name refers to the fact that Colombia had signed a treaty allowing the extradition of drug lords wanted by the U.S. to the U.S. for trial.  The kidnapping described in this book was a campaign of terror designed to roll back this legislation.  This pretty much worked since the extradition laws were overturned.<br />The journalism in this book reads like a novel.  We are witness to the horror of the kidnapping of people who are then help captive in Medellin and elsewhere.  The prisoner's psychological torment is made worse by the attitudes of their captors.  At one moment they could be gentle the next they would be brutal.  They were not physically tortured or psychologically abused.  But their absence from their families for up to a year and lack of news wore them down.  Some captives could have easily jumped out of windows and escaped.  But they had been blindfolded or stuffed onto the floorboards of a car when they were taken.  Consequently they did not know where they were even though most were in a city.  The captives were also hidden with the complicity of neighbors.  So if they fled to freedom they would no doubt have been betrayed by those around them.<br />There was a profile of Gabriel Marguez in \\"The New Yorker\\" magazine a year or two ago.  It seems he serves as a go-between and unpaid diplomat ferrying messages between the United States and Fidel Castro's Cuba.  Marquez has long been friends of Castro.  Riding around Colombia in an armored convoy he is a jet-setting politician traveling to Panama and beyond.  Like Honor&eacute; de Balzac, Victor Hugo, or Gore Vidal, this is a novelist who is involved in politics as well as writing.<br />If you have not read them, the fiction of Gabriel Marquez is a worthy pursuit.  My math teacher in college, no doubt being frustrated with kids who lacked a humanistic education, offered extra credit to those who read \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\".  Only after that class ended did I read that novel.  It is a \\"Buddenbrooks\\" for Latin America.  Much of it's settings and ideas are drawn from the jungle where Marquez grew up.  \\"Love in the time of Cholera\\" is just that: a love story set in the time when cholera ravaged the population.  The vision of dead bloated bodies floating in the river remains vivid in my mind.  \\"The General in His Labrynth\\" is a fictionalized look at the like of Simon Bolivar, liberator of Ecuador, Peru, and Columbia.  I like these books so much I have read each several times.<br />This business of kidnapping and civil war has ruined Colombia.  I would like to go there as a tourist.  Bogota is high in the sky and consequently cool like Quito, Ecuador.  It is surrounded by pleasant mountain vistas.  Cartagena is on the coast and I am sure has great beaches and fishing.  Maybe this madness of war will end one day.  Do as George Shultz, William F. Buckley, and George Soros say and legalize marijuana, heroin, and cocaine.  Then we would cut off all that violence at its pocket book source.re also hidden with the complicity of neighbors.

And then I read it a couple of more times in French and façile &agrave; lire (easy-to-read) French.  To add to my compulsion-my mother classified it thus-I saw the musical twice and bought both the English and French versions of the musical's music.<br />I read that during the war-I forget which war-French soldiers went into battle with a copy of Les Mis&eacute;rables under their arm.  The story of the heroism of the main character, Jean Valjean, was an inspiration to the lowly foot soldier.  The story of Victor Hugo, the author, must have been an inspiration as well.  Like Balzac, Hugo was active in politics.  When he died the whole country went into morning and he bodied laid in state.<br />This novel absolutely takes my breath away as it moves from one scene to the next.  It's appeal to the emotions under a less skilled novelist might have seemed corny and contrived.  But with Victor Hugo it comes off as genuine and heartfelt.<br />How many obscure characters from this novel can you name?  How about Fauchelevent.  Remember him?  Jean Valjean saved his life when he lifted the heavy cart that had fallen on him.  Later Fauchelevent is able to repay the favor by hiding Jean Valjean and Cosette in a cloister where the gendarmes and policeman Javert cannot enter.<br />The musical and the various movies made about this novel cannot possibly cover that incident and the host of other little events that happen in the novel and that warm the heart.  The musical and all the movies I have seen-two English and one French-skip, for example, the whole battle of Waterloo.  Here is where we first meet the lowly criminal Thernadier who is robbing dead soldiers of their belonging.<br />I have often wondered why the great critics-Edmund Wilson, Lionel Trilling, and Harold Wilson-have not mentioned this book as one of the greatest books of all time: part of the so-called Western Canon.  They don't disparage it.  They just don't mention it.  Maybe it's theme is too simple or it's ironies too few.  Perhaps they dismiss it as ordinary entertainment not worthy of the moniker &quot;classic&quot;.<br />In my mind this novel deserves such accolades as does Hugo's &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;.  (By the way, it peeves me that Walt Disney does not given proper, prominent credit to the authors of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (Hans Christain Anderson) and other films.  My kids used to think that Walt Disney wrote Snow White, Aladin, and others.  It's almost as annoying as that Barney television show which uses the melody of famous tunes and adds their own words without credit to the original authors.)<br />Finally, I recommend the latest French film &quot;Les Mis&eacute;rables&quot;.  It retells Victor Hugo's tale against the setting of World War II and is consequently something new.  Even the latest English film with Liam Neeson was a dissapointment-it told the tale exactly per the novel.  But the novel was too familiar to me so I found myself predicting each scene before it happened.

Perhaps one reason for this is that it's theme, that affirmative action served to undermine a great institution, has gained a wide following and affirmative action is being knocked down all across the country.  (Traub claims that his book takes no position on this debate but I believe it does.)<br />If for no other reason this book is great to read because it chronicles the City College of New York from it's heyday to it's decline.  (The current mayor of New York, Rudolph Gulianni, has reversed the policies of City College and embraced meritocracy once again.) But before I describe that I need to say in all fairness that only the humanities part of the college suffered under affirmative action.  The medical and engineering schools continue to be strong.  After all, as Traub points out, you cannot relax standards in, say, civil engineering.  If you did we would have bridges falling down.<br />In the 1930's through the 1960's the City College of New York was where young white Jews aspired to go to school  Woody Allen went there.  The student body became mainly Jewish.  The main City College campus is located in Harlem which is, of course, neither Jewish nor white.  It's geographical location is one reason that progressive educators and the community clamored for lowering standards.  The result was the school accepted students who were not prepared so they start remedial education courses.<br />Anyway important Jewish scholars went to school there.  Getrude Himmelfarb, Irving Kristol, and I believe Alfed Kazim and Irvin Howe are all alumni.  Traub's book describes how these budding scholars gathered at a certain table in the cafeteria to discuss rarefied topics.  Socialism was what these students believed.  (Of course Himmelfarb and Kristol, husband and wife, later broke with the socialists and started the Neo-conservative movement.)  The intellectual excitement described there is endearing and reminiscent of the movie &quot;Yentel&quot;.

The BBC read the whole book out loud on it's broadcast.  You can read about this and other events that transpired in Ben Yagoda's &quot;About Town: The New Yorker and the World it Made&quot;.<br />This book must have been the ultimate journalistic scoop of all times.  It's story idea is so obvious that I wondered why no else had the idea first.  Hersey traveled to Japan just one year after the end of the war and after the atomic bomb has blasted over Hiroshima.  The ground must have been still radioactive.  (In the book Hersey said that the ground was only 4 times normal radiation levels a few days after the explosion.  So Japanese scienists allowed the citizens to remain there.)<br />This book, like Truman Capote's &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, is part of The New Yorker genre called &quot;non-fiction novel&quot;.  They didn't really invent the technique but popularized it's style.  This is journalism written in the style of a novel that relates a true tale.  Well done, as in the case with both of these books, it holds your attention.<br />I find this book well-written and obviously interesting.  (No could make such a tale boring.)  But I think &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; and &quot;The Massacre of El Mozote&quot;, published as a long fact piece in The New Yorker are better written.  This is in spite of the heavy editing by William Shawn and many rewrites by John Hersey.<br />In the book we get to see what it was like for the people of Hiroshima to have lived under an atomic bomb blast.  The scenes are quite horrible.  A firestorm burns people in it's path.  The bomb's flash of light etches the frozen picture of a painter on a ladder on a marble wall.  A women cling to her dead baby for days on end.  Men and women cry out for help buried beneath piles of concrete and timbers.  100,000 people are killed outright and 80% of the building in the city are destroyed.<br />As Ben Yagoda says, this book put a human face on the atomic bomb.  It probably did a lot to rally anti-bomb people.  I for one am glad for this portrait because it makes clear and vivid what would happen to us if someone dropped such a weapon here.d.<br />As Ben Yagoda says, this book put a human face on the atomic bomb.

The deadpan style of writing was a little too simple if you can say that about someone's writing. That plus the difficulty of sounding the African words made me a little irritated when I read it.  I wondered what simpleton had written this text.  But then I read a critcism of \\"Heart of Darkness\\" written by Chinua Achebe.  (In it he says that Europeans have often used Africa as a \\"foil\\" to make their own accomplishments seem grander.)  Anyway, this essay was obviously the work of a learned scholar.  Why would such a sophisticated writer parody the Ernest Hemingway style with far-too-simple declarative sentences?<br />I will admit that this book is a good work of literature but I question whether it is a Great Book.  How many of it's 100,000 U.S. sales annually arise because students are compelled by their teachers to read it.  Is the real reason this book is widely read that it attacks European culture, colonialism, and church missionaries?  After all, attacks on the majority by the minority, such as \\"Why the Caged Bird Sings\\", have elevated writers of mediocre talent, write: \\"Alice Walker\\", to international acclaim.  (Toni Morrison is not a mediocre talent so say the critics with which I usually agree.  I have yet to read her work but look forward to doing so.)<br />As the review posted at Amazon.com says, Achebe does not get carried away and gloss over the brutal nature of African village culure.  He describes the warfare between tribes and implicitly attacks the pride that the villagers have in being great warriors.  He describes how twins are thrown away at birth.  (It was not clear to me if they killed them and then buried them in the Evil Forest.)<br />But Chinua Achebe himself is a product of the colonial, meaning British, culture that he attacks.  Brought up on English literature and short-listed for the Booker prize he owes much to the Victorian Era.  Had there been no colonials there would be no \\"Things Fall Apart\\".<br />Not all books that kids in school have read for many years are great books.  For example, Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a good book.  But why do so many schools assign it as if it was a great book?  And I think that \\"Things Fall Apart\\" would probably be good to assign to highschoolers.

That is what makes for great fiction--something that upends the emotions. The novel is set in Camus's native Algeria.  He is better know as one of the founder's of the existentialism philosophy which I cannot understand and, consequently, cannot explain.  I also read halfway through Camu's autobiographical novel &quot;The First Man&quot; and readl all of his world war II &quot;Troubled Sleep&quot;.	2000-09-22

On occasion The New Yorker itself is splashed across the front page of major newspapers with stories either by or about the magazine.  What other periodical is there whose change in editorship is chronicled with unfleeting attention as was recently the case when Editor Tina Brown was deposed.<br />The supposed demise of The New Yorker magazine has been chronicled many times and the subject is old hat.  It interestingly parallels the decline of our culture brought on by the decline of reading lamented by Alan Bloom, Harold Bloom and other cultural critics.  But The New Yorker still survives some 80 years after it was founded by Harold Bloom.  To appreciate it's place in the American psyche it is worth revisiting it's decades long history as Ben Yagoda has done in \\"About Town: The New Yorker and The World It Made\\".<br />Mr. Yagoda had free reign of the internal papers and correspondence of The New Yorker and willing participation from many of her former writers and editors.  His meticulously researched book is replete with facts and anecdotes that makes for a wonderful read.  Further he casts a critical eye at the magazine on it's literary merits and offers a well-read analysis of it's fiction in the manner of The New Yorker's own great literary critic Edmund Wilson.<br />It is difficult today to appreciate the impact that The New Yorker had on American culture in it's heydays of the 1930s through the 1950s.  That a humor magazine lacking a table of contents or photographs and whose articles were often without byline could sweep past such stalwarts as  \\"Life\\" and \\"The Saturday Evening Post\\" is prima facie difficult to understand.  In recent years the magazine lost it's poignancy and fell apart with spiraling financial losses (which continue today) and a dull demeanor that was famously mocked by recent editor Tina Brown when she criticized the \\"50,000 word article on sapphires\\".<br />Some of us like to read 50,000 word magazine articles and The New Yorker appears to be the only mass circulation forum to find such lengthy works.  Some of The New Yorker's long fact pieces-the distinction between \\"fact\\" and \\"fiction\\" is made clear in The New Yorker with an editor being assigned to head up each department-have been reprinted as famous books.  My personal favorite is the spine tingling murder tale \\"In Cold Blood\\" related by Truman Capote.  More famous is John Hershey's account of the atomic bomb dropped on Japan in \\"Hirsohima\\".  These articles read with a breathless pace that is steady and lends itself to reading in a single setting.  There is neither wasted adjective nor adverb.  These were heavily edited by William Shawn and others and retold in the famous New Yorker voice which reads as if many of the works in the magazine had been written by one person.  Some writers, such as Thomas Wolfe, have mocked that aspect of the magazine.<br />Some New Yorker writers did not appreciate such heavy-handed editing.  Vladimir Nabokov, author of the novel of illicit love \\"Lolita\\", complained to the editor and founder Harold Ross about Katherine White who wanted to alter his fiction.  Mrs. White was the patrician beauty and wife of the New Yorker writer E.B. White.  She, James Thurber, Harold Ross, and E.B. White set the pace for the magazine in it's early years.  White wrote the famous books \\"Charlotte's Web\\", \\"The Elements of Style\\", and \\"Stuart Little\\".<br />Brendan Gill in his 1975 book \\"Here at The New Yorker\\" openly disparages the fact side of the magazine while praising the fiction.  This is quite odd and overboard since Gill as a writer of fiction, Talk of the Town reporter, and the magazine's theater critic no doubt would have appreciated such newsworthy, well-written articles as \\"The Massacre at El Mozote\\".  This chronicled the massacre of hundreds of civilizians in El Salvador by the American-backed government.  This article is not ordinary journalism but is literary journalism such as was written by Truman Capote.  The article does not relate the facts in newspaper pyramid style fashion with short column inch paragraphs.  Rather the prose is written like a novel and makes a more interesting read albeit a much longer one than would fit into the conventional daily press.  Another great work of literary journalism described by Ben Yagoda is Lillian Ross's description of the making of the John Huston movie \\"The Red Badge of Courage\\".  And it is quite amazing that Edmund Wilson, author of the Marxist History \\"To the Finland Station\\" and the book of Civil War literature \\"Patriotic Gore\\", learned Hebrew so that he could document the Dead Sea Scrolls.<br />The import of fiction to the New Yorker seems to have waned.  Currently issues contain only one fiction piece while other works are relegated to-or perhaps made prominent in--a fiction-dominated version of the magazine which appears every few months.  Gone are the days when eager readers poured over each new issue looking for a story by John O'Hara or J.D. Salinger.  Not unfallable, The New Yorker has made some obvious gaffes when it turned down short stories by Flanner O'Connor and rejected a work by J.D. Salinger that would eventually become \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\".<br />Harold Ross was the magazine's founder and served as it's editor until 1951.  He is by far a more colorful figure than William Shawn and his legacy is greater.  Ross was something of a country redneck, sporting a crew cut, who hailed from what at that time was a rural village: Aspen, Colorado.  His dislike of Black people is describe by Yagoda.  Ross's gift was surrounding himself with talented writers and editors and giving then somewhat free reign to innovate.  Yet even he engaged in wholesale editing.

When I read this novel I found myself  repeatedly backing up rereading a page, a paragraph, or even a whole  chapter again.  This is not to say that I did not enjoy or understand the  text--on the contrary I found it quite a literary thrill.<br />It continually  amazes me how Faulkner's prose could be so difficult to read.  After all if  is written in the simple patois of country folk or the even simpler blather  of idiots like Vardaman or Bennie (&quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;).  The difficulty with &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; is there is, as Irving Howe  points out, no narrator, no omnipresent voice to relate the tale and point  out key observations.  Rather we have only the dialogue of the novels  characters to indicate what has transpired.  It is as a play albeit without  stage directions.<br />I read this book carefully but I was once again stung  when I missed key events.  It took Irving Howe's critical study to steer me  straight.  (Don't waste your time with Cliff Notes.  Read some real  literary criticism.)  I won't ruin the plot for you but let's say that I  thought that Dewey Dell had been able to get from the pharmacy the medicine  she sought.  Another point that required repeated rereading was who caused  the calamity at the Gillespie farm.<br />Subtlety is Faulkner's forte.  Rather  than explicit explained what has happened he carefully paints a picture  with words and phrases that are non too obvious.  In the case of &quot;As I  Lay Dying&quot; this method of writing is further demonstrated by the  technique of letting each character narrate what he or she has seen and  understood.  It rests upon you the read to draw conclusions as to what has  really happened.	2000-08-30

But now I have  real fodder for my criticsm.  Alan Bloom says we don't read and have lost  our way culturally speaking.<br />I checked up on what he says about education  in Europe.  He says the Italians still read Machievelli and Dante and the  French read Rosseau, Descartes, and Pascal.  But the dim-witted American's  don't hardly even read the Bible anymore--this is the one book that we all  use to read.  So it gave us a common place from which to draw fables and  other lessons to guide us in our lives.<br />The discussion of the history of  political philosophy from Aristotle to Hegel was difficult to understand.  Not because it was poorly written--this stuff is just difficult to  understand period.  But having read it I understand somewhat that the  German thinkers have postulated ideas that we all now take for granted.  In  other words, the thinkers in their ivory towers do really impact the course  of our lives so we should pay attention.<br />Anyway, Alan Bloom has made we  want to go back and read Aristotle et al.  In higschool English all I did  was leer at the blond across the room.  I realize now that I did have a  poor education when compared with my Europeans counterparts.  But you might  argue that those folks over there no longer dominate the culture.  That is  true but I would prefer an aestethic culture to the television culture that  is endemic to our McDonald's American culture.  I for one will not let my  mind close up with the rest.<br />I read Ravelstein as well which is a must  companion to &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot;	2000-08-21

Harold Bloom, the literar critic from  Yale, said that this book requires considerable learning to read and  understand.  Having read all of it and understood most of it I feel pretty  well.<br />The thrilling part of this novel is when Hans Castrop is educated  into the ways of an intellectual life by his mentor Herr Settembrini.  In  the rarefied air of the mountain sanatorium the two debate art and  literature.  For an air-chair intellectual like myself it was fun to learn  more about the humanities from the discourse of Herr Settembrini.<br />Like  all of Mann's novels and short stories the prose is beautifully written.  And as Susan Sontag points out &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; includes it's  own built in literary criticism to help you understand the plot and  theme.<br />For a homosexual, Thomas Mann knows the heterosexual skill of  seducing a female.  When Hans Castorp was wooing Madame Chucat I had to  look over my shoulder and see if anyone spied my embarrassment as I am sure  I was blushing.  This was such a beautiful narrative that I wanted to  subject it to memory so I could use it in the future.  (I have the same  goal for some of Shakespeare's sonnets and soliloquoys.)<br />I am still a  little confused by the ending.  I won't ruin it for you but suffice it to  say it is not clear to me which character was the subject of the final few  paragraphs.  Maybe someone can recommend an Edmund Wilson, Irving Howe, or  other informed criticism that I can read.	2000-08-21

That is wrong--this book does not entertain it probes.  Granted there are  some funny anecdotes and glances of writers like Scott Fitzgerald.  But the  book has a darker more serious side as well.<br />I imagine that Brendan Gill  has made many enemies with his book.  He talked about Editor Harold Ross's  racism and William Shawn's phobias.  Of many he writers he either praises  them or he says they did not produce much legible writing at all.<br />But  these dark character portraits are wonderfully written and penetrate deep.  After reading Gill I think I can more carefully size up my peers.  This one  is a drunk never-do-well. That one works all day to keep away from his  wife.  Brendan Gill has the novelist's eye for detail.	2000-08-21

As a corporate cubicle prisoner, I myself wish I could live the literary life--the best I can hope for is to read about such people and  to read all the literature I possibly can.  Alan Bloom's life seems--as it  was depicted in a excerpts of &quot;Ravelstein&quot; published in The New  Yorker--seems similar to the life of Robert Hughes also eulogized in  &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.  Both were gay intellectuals whose telephone  rang day and night with international calls seeking a bit of well-informed  analysis.<br />Of course, having just read &quot;Ravelstein&quot; I have  jumped into &quot;The Closing of the American&quot; mind.  But I am puzzled  by Saul Bellow's introduction.  He says that Moses Herzog, of the novel  &quot;Herzog&quot; tries to learn about life by reading the great books.  But Saul Bellow says you learn about life by living it--not by reading  about it.  But isn't the theme of Bloom's essays that such readin gives us  a continuum of societies fables and tales and a moral foundation with which  we can understand life's issues and the personalities that we meet.  Seems  the two ideas don't mesh.<br />I think the Saul Bellow must be trying to sooth  his damaged heart by writing about his bitter marriage to the character  Elva's real life equal, Bellow's mathematician wife.  It is good that his  friend Ravelstein (Bloom) is there to help Chick (Bellow) understand what a  really cruel woman she is.  Chick seems able to discern such matters.  Martial discord and the pain thereof also is the major theme of  &quot;Herzog&quot;.  In a way it is good that Bellow has had such  tormenting affairs, otherwise we would not have received such wonderful  literature.	2000-05-19

Too many journalists (e.g. George Will) and writers on amazon.com have severely attacked this book.  But I think these folks are simply not prepared for a biography which is written as a work of literature.  What's  wrong with that?  After all much of what historians write is too boring or  too technical to wade through (e.g. Simon Schama).<br />As for Morris  interjecting his fictional self into the Reagan plot, Norman Mailer in  &quot;Harlot's Ghost&quot; deftly argued in favor of such fictional  accounts of history.  Basically Mailer said if you ask 100 pundits about  the Kennedy presidency, the Cuban missle crisis, and the CIA you would get  100 interpretations.  Only the novelist can rise above the mountains of  details and construct a single object that has a coherent meaning.  So in  some regards the novelist's portrayal of the past if more accurate that the  historians.  (For a more convincing argument than mine read &quot;Harlot's  Ghost&quot; yourself.)<br />&quot;Dutch&quot;is a good read that is quite  interesting and fair in the treatment of the subject.  Where Reagan  deserves praise--e.g. Reagan's declaration before congress that Communists  or anyone else could join Hollywood's labor unions--Morris delivers it.  Where Reagan deserves scorn--he failed to recognize son Michael at his high  school graduation--Morris delivers that too.	2000-01-12

An Irishman who somehow was labeled one of the great souther writerss.  But after I read the &quot;Correspondence of Walker Percy and Shelby Foote&quot; I see her peers  considered this young Savannah Girl a literary giant.  Her name was not an  attempt to mask her identify as was the case with George Eliot, the female  author of Middlemarch. Flannery, evidently, is female.<br />Wise Blood is a  novel more likely to have occured in the hilly piedmont or mountains than  the coast of Georgia.  For a dark religious novel set around Savannah or  Beaufort would no doubt mention voodoo as it is and has been practiced by  the Blacks there.  (Dr. Buzzard of &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and  Evil&quot; is only the most famous example.)<br />Wise Blood starts off kind  of boring as its characters slowly are unwound before us.  The major  characters are holy-roller type street preachers.  The type you might find  speaking in tongues at any of a thousand Pentacostal churches spread across  the South.  Higher up in the hills these same holly rollers would be  sporting rattlesnakes.  These snake handlers say their faith in god  protects them from the serpant.  That is the literal interpretation of the  bible that define the fundamental Christain.  These verbatim dogma are the  same beliefs for the characters of Flannery O'Connor.<br />Yet O'Connor's holy  man is a Christain without Christ.  He preaches at the street corner of a  Chruch with no Jesus.  Blasphemy is the way to salvation he says.  The  rivalry between this preacher and another preacher points to another  Southern theme--the dangerous violence that lurks beneath so many seemingly  pious Southern souls.<br />The novel ends in a ghastly fashion that still  haunts me today.  I haven't felt the same horror about a book since I  finished John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.  (By the way, Steinbeck did  not like the South and said so in &quot;Travels with Charlie&quot;.)

PBS said that Lillian Hellman is the foremost female American playright and  movie script writer.  She was also sympathetic to or at least a devoted  student of the communism of Marx and Engels. During the McArthy era she and  her boyfriend, novelist Dashiell Hammett, were forced to testify before the  Committee on Un-American Activities.<br />But to focus on her communist  sympathies would be a distraction from the rest of her remarkable life.  Lillian does not.  This memoir is a fascinating mix of travel essay,  character portraits, and a biography of her unorthodox youth split between  Louisianna and New York.<br />The best written chapters are character  portraits of her friends Dorothy Parker and Dashiel Hammett.  It is here  that you can understand her skills as a playright for she probes the  actions of each person and seeks to explain why they behaved as they did.  Let interesting a chapters where she just inserts portions of her diary in  chronological order.<br />As a Southernor I can understand the relation she  had with Sophronia, the black woman who acted as her governess and parent's  housekeeper.  For in the South the lives of blacks and whites intertwine in  a manner that non-Southerners would not understand. Sophronia untangled the  problems in Lilians life long after she left the Hellman's employ.<br />Parts of this memoir reads like Getrude Stein's &quot;The Biography of  Alice B. Toklas&quot;.  There is much name dropping of Ernest Hemingway and  F. Scott Fitzgerald. Like Hemingway, Lillian joined the fight against  facism in Spain. But the Paris-based passages are not so memorable as those  of Getrude Stein in part since these literary are art circles were not such  a large part of Lillian's life.  In fact she preferred the seclusion of her  farm to life in the city.<br />Far more noteworthy is Lillian's description of  6 months in the Soviet Union during World War II as a guest of the Soviet  government.  Lillian was envied by the regular press corps because she  travelled to the front lines while they were restricted to their dreary  hotel.<br />After reading her memoirs, I doubt I will reads her plays.
