Margaret Creighton's book, \\"The Colors of Courage: Gettysburg's Forgotten History\\" (2005) succeeds on both counts. Margaret Creighton is Professor of History at Bard College, Maine.  Her study of the Battle of Gettysburg focuses on the people and groups that frequently do not receive their full due: the Union XIth Corps, composed in large part of German immigrants, slightingly referred to as \\"Dutch\\", and its leaders, the German immigrants in the Borough of Gettysburg, the women of Gettysburg, and the African-American community in Gettysburg and its environs.  Professor Creighton also discusses the \\"Louisiana Tigers\\" a much-feared unit of the Confederate Army.  Each of these groups, Professor Creighton shows the reader, had something at stake in the Battle of Gettysburg over and above the military maneuvers and strategies, and each contributed something important to the result of the battle and to its significance.<br /><br />The book begins with some stage-setting of where each group stood just before the Battle.  Thus the Union XI Corps was smarting from the defeat of the Union Army at Chancellorsville, and it was viewed as the scapegoat because it was the victim of Stonewall Jackson's surprise attack on the far Union flank.<br /><br />Professor Creighton gives a good picture of pre-war Gettysburg, something most other histories treat too lightly. Women of Gettysburg were of varying economic and social status and had to bear much of the brunt of the invasion because many of the men were in military service or had left the town in anticipation of the invasion.<br /><br />Approximately eight percent of Gettysburg's population was African-American.  Most of the African-American population was poor and stuggling, but some individuals had managed to acquire land and property and to attain positions of influence and respect within their community.  With the Confederate invasion, most of the African-American population that was able to do so left town.  And with good reason.  The Southern Army seized African-Americans as \\"contraband,\\" including those who had never spent a day in Southern slavery, and sent them South to a life of slavery.  Professor Creighton describes this well as the \\"reverse Underground Railroad.\\"<br /><br />In Professor Creighton's account, we see how the XI Corps and its leaders tried to redeem themselves at Gettysburg.  She shows how women conducted themselves heroically during the battle by offering a mixture of cooperation with and resistance to the invading troops.  After the Battle, many women in the town made tireless and demanding efforts in caring for the wounded and the dying.<br /><br />There is a great deal of attention paid to Gettysburg's African-American community and how it was changed by the Battle.  I found the discussion of the African-American residents of Gettysburg the most fascinating part of the book and the part which has been least explored in other studies.<br /><br />The book is brought to life by its treatment of individuals as well as groups.  Thus we meet a variety of people in the XI Corps, from its Commander, General Otis Howard, through the German immigrant Generals Schurz and Schimmelfennig on Howard's staff, through the enlisted corporal Adam Muenzenberger who is taken prisoner on July 1 and dies in a prison camp.  We see a great deal of Georgia Wade McClellan and her more famous sister, Jennie Wade, and learn more about them than is usual in battle studies.  We also hear a great deal about Elizabeth Thorn, who in 2002 at last received a monument in her honor.  Mrs. Thorn, pregnant and the keeper of the Evergreen Cemetery provided great and hazardous service before, during, and after the Battle of Gettysburg.  Again Professor Creighton makes nuances and details of her story come alive that often get little attention.<br /><br />The African-Americans described in Professor Creighton's study include Abraham Brian, whose home remains on the Gettysburg Battlefield on Cemetery Ridge at the center of the Confederate attack, the flamboyant Mag Palm, Owen Robinson, a successful businessman, and Basil Biggs, who did a great deal of work burying fallen soldiers after the Battle.  Professor Creighton also uses a great deal of oral histories based upon her interviews with Catherine Carter and Margaret Nutter, descendants of African-Americans in Gettysburg at the time of the Battle.  These sources are unusual and have much to teach about the Battle.<br /><br />Professor Creighton tells her story in a clear, dignified way which, for the most part, is free of polemic.  She reminds the reader that Gettysburg was fought for human freedom and that the goals of the battle and the Civil War, particularly the promise of freedom and dignity to African-Americans, sometimes were forgotten in the spirit of reconciliation that came to pervade American life following Reconstruction.  Professor Creighton tells an important story, or a series of important stories, and she tells them well.  Her book was a pleasure to read and taught me a great deal about the facts and the meaning of the Battle of Gettysburg.<br /><br />Robin Friedmand in Professor Creighton's study include Abraham Brian, whose home remains on the Gettysburg Battlefield on Cemetery Ridge at the center of the Confederate attack, the flamboyant Mag Palm, Owen Robinson, a successful businessman, and Basil Biggs, who did a great deal of work burying fallen soldiers after the Battle.

Doctorow explores the American Civil War, spcifically the march of General W.T. Sherman and his army through Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina in 1864 --1865. Sherman's march is generally regarded by historians as the predecessor of modern total war.  The march was directed not only against the Confederate army, but against an entire people, as Sherman's soldiers cut a broad swatch through the States and through cities, destroying resources, homes and food everything in their path.  The war was of such a magnitude and the passions among the combatants and the citizens so strong that the will of the South to fight, not only the force of arms, needed to be subdued.  This was a cruel, difficult, and still controversial march as Sherman cut his Army of from its own communications and supplies further North, maurauded, and pillaged and lived off the land bringing destruction to everything in its wake and spawning a long legacy of bitterness in the South.<br /><br />Doctorow begins his story of Sherman's campaign in the midst of it -- after the Union Army had captured Atlanta and begun the first leg of its march to Savannah, Georgia.  Doctorow gives a vivid picture of an Army on the march, for the most part unopposed, destroying everything in its path.  The march through Georgia is the subject of the first section of the book.<br /><br />The second part of the book describes the campaign into South Carolina.  Destruction in this portion of the campaign reached astounding levels because Sherman, together with most of the Union leaders, held South Carolina responsible for initiating the war. This section of the book includes graphic pictures of the Union Army's difficult march through the swamps of lower South Carolina and of the burning of Columbia. (There is still disagreement about whether the North or the South was primarily responsible for the burning.  Doctorow shows that it was some of both.)<br /><br />The third section of the book, set in North Carolina, deals with the waning days of the War, with the final battle of Bentonville, with Sherman's meeting with Grant and Lincoln, and with the end of the War and Lincoln's assasination.  The Nation clearly and a great deal of healing and soul-searching to do.<br /><br />Doctorow gives the reader an excellent sense of the movement of the armies, the horrors of war, death, injury, and barbarity, and, in particular, of the state of medical practice during the conflict.  We are given a good portrait of General Sherman, but of the other leaders of the Army only the calvary leader Kilpatrick, known as \\"Kil -Kilpatrick\\" for his feckless behavior gets a great deal of attention.<br /><br />The book takes a broad sweep, but there is no single main character that stands out.  The story is mostly presented through vignettes and minatures involving a wide cast of characters.  These include a brilliant but emotionally cold Union doctor, Wrede Sartorius, a beautiful young former slave, Pearl, who can pass for white, former Southern slaveholders whose plantations are destroyed and lives uprooted, and Arly and Will, two poor rural Southern soldiers who endure a variety of adventures behind Union lines and provide comic, if sardonic, relief.  These individual stories are told from a variety of perspectives and are interlaced with each other.  Thus, it takes attention on the reader's part to follow the narrative.<br /><br />The stories show a great deal about the effects of the march on specific people and groups of people -- we see the war through the eyes of the newly freed slaves, of the dispossessed plantation owners, and of the troops on the ground, among other people and are encouraged to think about its scope and significance.  Doctorow puts meditiations and soliloquy passages into the parts of some of his protagonists about death, freedom, destruction, and sexuality.  These are among the best parts of the book.  Doctorow's characters are well-developed andtheir stories help us to understand varying perspectives on the conflict.  But at times, I found them somewhat mannered and a distraction from the focus of the book on Sherman's march.<br /><br />There are several highly graphic depictions of death, injury, suffering, and surgical operations in this book which capture unforgettably the brutality of warfare.<br /><br />Doctorow has written an excellent novel about Sherman's march which will encourage the reader to reflect upon its meaning for and continued influence upon our Nation's history.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanell-developed and their stories help us to understand varying perspectives on the conflict.

The event has been appropriately marked by new editions of Whitman, new studies, and by many conferences and celebrations to explore Whitman's legacy.<br /><br />But the most fitting way to celebrate Whitman is to read or to reread him.  David Reynolds's short biography, \\"Walt Whitman\\" (2005) breaks no new ground about its subject.  Instead, in 154 pages it introduces the reader to the main facts of Whitman's life and to the many themes that appear in his poetry and prose works.  It is a good introduction for those readers wishing some background before beginning a study of Whitman.  David Reynolds is Distinguished Professor of English and American Studies at Baruch College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.  This book is largely a distillation of Professor Reynolds's longer study \\"Walt Whitman's America: A Cultural Biography\\" (1995).<br /><br />Walt Whitman (1819-1892) had little formal education.  He held a variety of jobs as a newspaper editor and writer before publishing his masterpiece, the first edition of \\"Leaves of Grass\\" in 1855.  This work set forth a vision of a United States based upon pluralism, egalitarianism, a kind of secularized and ecumenical mysticism, and acceptance of one's sexuality that many readers, myself included, still find deeply inspiring.  Whitman largely fulfilled the goal he set himself of setting forth the ideals of the United States in poetic form.  The free verse he developed in \\"Leaves of Grass\\" changed dramatically the structure and technique of subsequent poetry.<br /><br />Professor Reynolds's study opens with a brief chapter on Whitman's life.  The remaining six chapters of the book discuss themes and influences important to Whitman and to the understanding of his work.  Professor Reynolds offers vivid but brief pictures of the New York City of Whitman's day, of Whitman's interest in oratory, the theater, and music, both popular and classical.  Professor Reynolds describes Whitman's interest in the new medium of photography and in art.  There is a discussion of Whitman's religious and philosophical views and of his dream of a secular, ecumenical, yet personal faith.  We see Whitman's interests in phrenology, spiritualism, and, later in life, in the religions of the East.  There is a chapter on Whitman's attitudes towards sexuality -- a subject much explored which receives only a limited treatment here -- and a chapter on Whitman's reverence for Lincoln and on his services during the Civil War as a nurse.  The themes of each chapter are illustrated with appropriate short quotations from Whitman's prose and poetry.<br /><br />I think Whitman's importance lies in his poetic expression of the democratic ideal, his commitment to nonsectarian religion, and to his recognition of the force of sexuality in human life which, interestingly, Whitman thought formed one of the bases of democracy.  The Nobel-Prize winning author J.M. Coetzee has recently written that \\"the most attractive feature of Whitman's dreamed-of United States is that it does not demand of its citizens the sublimation of eros in the interest of the state.\\" (New York Review, September 22, 2005, p. 22)  Reynolds's book will introduce the reader to these aspects of Whitman's work.<br /><br />Reynolds's book will have served its purpose if in encourages readers to visit or revisit Whitman.  For those readers wanting to do so, I recommend the outstanding edition of Whitman's poetry and major prose works in the Library of America series.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanf the New York City of Whitman's day, of Whitman's interest in oratory, the theater, and music, both popular and classical.

US	48185764	R24TO9B2SIHPKO	9004135731	674766550	Plato and the Good: Illuminating the Darkling Vision (Philosophy of History & Culture)	Books	4	11	11	N	N	A Study of Plato	Rosemary Desjardins's \\"Plato and the Good\\" (2004) reminds the reader why Plato remains a seminal figure of Western thought. Her book is a comprehnsive study of Plato focusing on the idea of the good and the nature of piety.<br /><br />At the outset it is worth mentioning several fundamentals of Desjardins's approach to Plato. These positions are well-warranted and plausible, but they, and the positions they reject, are the subject of endless discussion among careful students of Plato.  Perhaps most importantly, Desjardins sees a unity of thought in the dialogues from the earliest to the latest.  Thus she does not find a change in teachings from the earliest \\"aporetic\\" dialogues through the dialogues of the middle period, such as the \\"Republic\\" through the difficult later dialogues such as the \\"Philebus\\".  Second, Desjardins stresses the internal unity of the dialogues and their dramatic form.  The setting of the dialogues, the characters they present, and the dramatic scenes they set (such as the \\"Euthyphro\\" in which Socrates engages a young man about to prosecute his father for impiety in a discussion on the meaning of piety) are integral to the meaning of the works and necessary for their understanding.  Third, Desjardins sees Plato's most basic purpose in the dialogues as the explanation and justification of the philosophic way of life.  Specifically, Plato aims to explain the work of his teacher, Socrates, and to show how it exemplified a life of piety and wisdom.<br /><br />Desjardins's study thus moves freely from one dialogue to another -- and from one period of Plato's work to another -- and draws intriguing connections between works that are often missed. She wants to show what Plato meant by \\"the Good\\", both the good life for human beings and some overriding view of \\"the Good\\" as something divine, and why this remains important.<br /><br />Desjardins begins her analysis with the \\"Philebus\\" which seemingly explains a good human life as including elements of both pleasure and knowledge but quickly moves beyond that to elements of dialectic.  She proceeds to examine the dialectic of the Philebus, sometimes called the method of division and to compare it with the famous simile of the divided line in book VI of the \\"Republic\\" where Plato offers it as a tantalizing picture of the nature of human knowledge.  Desjardings finds the discussion in the \\"Philebus\\" consistent with the discussion of the \\"Republic\\".  She finds Plato offering a theory of emergentism in which knowledge is first based upon sense impressions, combined by mind into three-dimensional objects, and unified into a whole.  The search for unity is driven by the drive for coherence, consistency, and integrity and, ultimately by ideals of beauty and goodness.  The idea of the good is a power that can direct the course of human endeavor and integrate the individual person with other people and ultimately with the divine.  In trying to understand through the good, we can see unity, wholeness, and purpose through apparent chaos and diversity. Explaining the nature of the good is the burden of the first part of Desjardins's study.<br /><br />In the second part of her study, Desjardins explores Plato's understanding of piety and its relationship to the good.  Desjardins concludes that, for Plato, \\"to share in the generation of ordered wholeness ... is to share in the work of the divine, the 'ergon of the gods' which in the \\"Euthyphro\\" is identified as 'piety'. (p.229)  Her discussion of piety plays close attention to Plato's early dialogue \\"Euthyphro\\" which, for most readers, appears to end inconclusively as Socrates tries to get Euthyphrho to realize that he knows nothing of piety.  Yet, Desjardins argues, the dramatic structure, the search for truth, and Socrates's character, shown in the \\"Euthyphro\\" and in the Platonic corpus shows the reader, in a way that eristic argument cannot, what piety is and how a good human life may be lived.<br /><br />Desjardins supports her understanding of Plato's conception of piety with diverse readings, including, particularly, the treatment in the \\"Phaedrus\\" of divine madness.  She also discusses at some length the \\"Sophist\\" and \\"Thaetetus\\" together with Plato's dramatization of Socrates's defense of himself from the charge of impiety in the \\"Apology.\\"  Piety and the good life involve a sharing of human beings in the life of the divine.  Thus Desjardins concludes, regarding the Platonic/Socratic quest:<br /><br />\\"[T]he source of wellbeing and happiness for human beings rests upon fulfillment of a divinely human ergon [function] in which, with loving care we create within ourselves and in the world around us ... the kind of order we recognize as beautiful and call 'reality'. To pursue the task of bringing about beautiful order ... through the exercise of loving care.. proves to be (so the \\"Phaedrus\\" also tells us) the comprehensive ergon shared by  gods and human beings.\\" (pp.229-230)<br /><br />This is a difficult study which presents a compelling and coherent view of Plato's thought.  As with all works of difficulty and importance, it will not convince all readers.  The work is extensively footnoted and Desjardins explains the work of other scholars with whom she agrees or disagrees.  I found it rewarding to grapple again with the thought of Plato after an absence from him of some time.  This book will appeal to students of serious students of philosophy and of the classics.  The book will not, and is not intended to, serve as an introductory text to those readers coming to Plato for the first time.<br /><br />Robin Friedmandins supports her understanding of Plato's conception of piety with diverse readings, including, particularly, the treatment in the \\"Phaedrus\\" of divine madness.

It is a basic text of Mahayana Buddhism and recited daily in monasteries and by practicing Buddhists throughout the world.<br /><br />There are many commentaries, ancient and modern, on this text, but I found this recent book by the Dalai Lama, \\"Essence of the Heart Sutra\\" an outstanding place for the beginner to start.  The Dalai Lama's book also will reward study by those having great prior familarity with the text.  The book is based on a series of lectures that the Dalai Lama gave at the Land of Medicine Buddhist center in California and at the Three Rivers Dharma in Pittsburg.<br /><br />This work is much more than a commentary on the Heart Sutra.  It is equally valuable as an introduction to Buddhism and as a compendium of the teachings of the Dalai Lama.  It is instructive to see how the Dalai Lama weaves his broad material together into a coherent whole. Thus, in the first part of the book, the Dalai Lama offers broad-based comments on the spiritual dimension of life, of the relationship between Buddhism and other religions, and of the fundamentals of Buddhist teachings.  It is inspiring to hear words of ecumenicism, tolerance, and willingness to learn from others.  It is also important to read the Dalai Lama's exposition of the basic Buddhist teaching of Dependent Origination, which is, in later sections of the book, tied masterfully to the interpretation of the Heart Sutra.<br /><br />The second part of the book offers a translation and commentary on the Heart Sutra.  Consistent with his opening chapters, the Dalai Lama stresses the continuity between this Mahayana text and its earlier predecessors in Theravada Buddhism. (Many other commentaries emphasize how the Heart Sutra departs from and differs from its predecessors.)  In addition, in a few brief pages the Dalai Lama offers great insight into the fundamental teaching of emptiness --- that reality is \\"empty of intrinsic existence.\\"  He points out clearly that the Sutra does not teach that nothing exists -- a nihilistic doctrine.  Instead, the Dalai Lama relates the teaching of the Sutra to the doctrine of Dependent Origination -- stressing the lack of independent existence, substantiality, and ego.  He discusses different ways in which various Buddhist schools interpret the doctrine of emptiness -- including the \\"mind-only\\" school and two variants of the \\"middle-way\\" school.  This material is difficult but important and not stressed in various other commentaries that I have read.<br /><br />The final part of the Dalai' Lama's study discusses the Bodhisattva path of Mahayana Buddhism -- the decision to dedicate oneself to the welfare of others -- and relates it to the text of the Heart Sutra.  There are teachings and practices here on learning to practice lovingkindness, also set forth in other writings of the Dalai Lama, but informed here by the discussion of emptiness and nonclinging in the Heart Sutra.  This discussion, and the short epilogue, tie together the ecumenical material in the book with the elucidation and analysis of the Heart Sutra.<br /><br />This book presents difficult, profound teachings in an accessible readable way.  It is ideal for the beginning student or for those who want to explore the Heart Sutra to see what it might offer.  It also presents an exposition of this text by the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism.  For those who want to read further and compare and contrast other approaches to this inexhaustible text, I recommend Red Pine's study \\"The Heart Sutra\\" and Donald Lopez' \\"Elaborations of Emptiness\\", a detailed and difficult analysis of the Heart Sutra in light of its earliest Indian and Tibetan commentaries.<br /><br />Robin Friedmang of emptiness --- that reality is \\"empty of intrinsic existence.\\"  He points out clearly that the Sutra does not teach that nothing exists -- a nihilistic doctrine.

As Professor Burham reminds us, this music consists of a relatively small body of work from Beethoven's middle period, primarily the third and fifth symphonies, the \\"Emperor\\" concerto, the \\"Waldstein\\" and \\"Appassionata\\" piano sonatas, and several overtures.  Yet, for many listeners, these works have come to be regarded as the greatest achievement of Western music and, more importantly, as the paradigms by which other music is heard and judged.<br /><br />Much of Professor Burnham's study is devoted to explaining the nature of Beethoven's heroic music and the reasons for its power and appeal.  He finds that this music has been found by virtually all listeners to speak of the human condition in terms of suffering and struggle and the overcoming of suffering through will, persistence, and self-actualization.  Thus, Professor Burnham offers an analysis of the first movement of the Eroica symphony which shows that listeners who hear this music in terms of a programatic, extra-musical interpretation (the struggles and ultimate victory of a hero) describe the work in ways essentially similar to those listeners who use more formalistic, strictly musical descriptions. (in terms, for example, of the long, ambiguous exposition, the new thematic material in the development, the horn call that begins the recaptitulation, the expansive coda).  Professor Burnham then follows this discussion with his own analysis of the first movement of the fifth symphony which tries to show in musical terms how this work retains its hold over the imagination of many people.<br /><br />Professor Burnham then discusses how Beethoven's heroic style became paradigmatic for all music.  There is a difficult but fascinating discussion of the work of four 19th and 20th century musical theorists, A.B. Marx, Hugo Riemann, Heinrich Schenker, and Rudolph Reti, and their use of Beethoven.  Broadly speaking, these theorists took Beethoven as their model, tried to determine in their various ways the structural, thematic, and harmonic patterns they found in Beethoven's music, and then made these patterns normative for considering all music.  Their work, for Burnham, shows both the enormous influence of Beethoven and how his work became paradigmatic through what is essentially circular reasoning.<br /><br />Following this musical analysis, Professor Burnham changes his focus and finds that Beethoven's music captures the worldview of his time in Germany which he finds rooted in Goethe, with its focus on the self and on concepts of change and becoming, and Hegel, with its focus on consciousness and transcendence.  Hegelian idealism has, for the most part, lost its philosophical appeal; but its goals and values remain moving in Beethoven's music in a way that bare philosophy could never realize.  This discussion and the discussion of musical theory are the pivotal sections of Burnham's book.<br /><br />This leads to the second main theme of Burnham's analysis.  While he does not for a moment deny the power or appeal of Beethoven's music, he argues that listeners and critics have been too ready to accept it as the sole paradigm and as the model of what music should be.  Thus, he argues, the heroic style incorporates a set of musical and ethical values but, grand as they are, there is no reason for them to be exclusive.  He points out that other music that does not conform to the heroic paradigm is sometimes given short shrift simply because it is \\"not Beethoven\\".  Professor Burnham's prime example is the music of Schubert (p. 155, p. 167).  Every reader will recognize the tendency Burnham describes and think of other cases.<br /><br />The goal of this book, I think, is to encourage the appreciation of Beethoven (The book seems to me to overstate the regard in which his heroic music is held in a definitely skeptical, anti-heroic age such as our own.) but to recognize that there are other ways of hearing music and of appealing to the heart.

The main characters, the widowed Adele Ivri, her two children, Joseph and Asa, and their mysterious houseguest Eva Higashi, are returning home from  synagogue in Windsor, Canada. Adele Ivri remarks upon the beauty of an old gnarled elm tree she had not noticed before.  Eva remarks that there is much to be learned from a fresh sighting of a beautiful object. And she explains that \\"in the end, neither knowledge nor wisdom makes a person good\\". (pp. 172 -- 173)<br /><br />I found this passage striking in a book which describes eloquently the love of learning, both secular and religious, the attractions of beauty, and the power of the imagination.  The passage also illuminates the theme of the book in which the values of learning, beauty and imagination are juxtaposed against the realities of loss, suffering and guilt.<br /><br />This novel is set in Winsdor, Canada following WW II with the recently widowed Adele raising her two sons Joseph and Asa.  Joseph is the narrator of the book.  He is physically unattractive but possessed of great intellect and of the drive to study. The younger son, Asa, is possessed of great physical beauty and of artistic talent.  Unfortunately, he is slowly but inexorably going blind.<br /><br />During the summer when Joseph is 14, the Ivri family takes in a mysterious boarder, Eva Higashi (nee Laquedem), a beautfiful young woman possessed of great knowledge.  Her father had been a scholar in Prague, and Eva is trying to complete his final manuscript, \\"Clouds of Glory\\".  Eva brings with her a priceless illuminated manuscript, the \\"Augsburg Miscellany\\" dating from the fifteenth century. Eva soon leaves the Ivri's home as mysteriously as she arrived.  Joseph's and Asa's experiences with her during these few short summer months become the formative moments of their lives.<br /><br />Joseph, the narrator of the story, ultimately becomes a famous research neuroanatomist who, following his retirement, enjoys great popular acclaim upon the publication of his short philosophical and mystical meditation, \\"The Illuminated Soul\\". This short book, in turn, is based upon Joseph's recollections of his family's few summer months with Eva.<br /><br />This short book is filled with discussions of Torah study, of biblical archaeology, Japanese literature, neuroanatomy, and much else. (The author is himself a neuroradiologist.) I was much taken with the discussions of birds and their intelligence, (the story features a pet parrot named Nebucadnezzer) because it reminded me of my own pet bird.  There are also many beautifully allusive stories and themes of unicorns and giraffes, of early Japanese novels, and of changing and shimmering colors in the sky that deeply influence the young boys and are captured in the mysticism of Joseph's \\"Illuminated Soul\\".<br /><br />Each of the characters in the story have their own secrets, their own tragedy, and their own guilt.  We learn to see into them in this beautifully-paced and told book.  For all its appeal to learning, imagination, and even religious faith, for me the story speaks most strongly of the inevitability of change and of the overriding importance of cultivating goodness of heart.

I do so as one human being speaking with another\\". With these words, the Dalai Lama opens his recent guide to expanding one's circle of loving relationships through the practice of love and compassion. This book is simply and eloquently written, and its teachings are wise.  The Dalai Lama points out that human beings are essentially alike when superficial differences are pealed away. In addition, all religions are essentially alike to the extent they teach love, kindness, and peace and \\"a desire to help their fellow beings.\\" (p.4)  The Dalai Lama presents a way of understanding these insights and a means of bringing them into focus in one's life through the practice of lovingkindness.  Some of the teachings in this book make use of specifically Buddhist beliefs such as the doctrine of rebirth.  But the practices and principles of this book can be used with benefit regardless of whether the reader accepts or doesn't accept rebirth or other specifically Buddhist doctrines.<br /><br />The Dalai Lama sets forth a process of reflective understanding and meditation in first understanding the nature of love and then learning to practice it. It is an inner-directed teaching in that it looks to the self and to self-understanding rather than to externals -- to things beyond one's control such as wealth or power or to success -- as the key to happiness.  Thus, the first part of the Dalai Lama's teaching in this book is directed to an understanding of the basic purity of the human mind.  Because the mind is pure, it is possible, for the Dalai Lama, to remove defilements such as hatred, lust, and ignorance.  The radiant, empty character of the mind also links all human beings together in terms of establishing a commonality and an ability to love and be loved.  It teaches that people ought not to be categorized in that beyond the defilements that plague all of us, we are essentially human with the need to be loved and to be free from suffering. This teaching of the pure, radiant mind (\\"Buddha nature\\") possessed by all is the most fundamental and difficult teaching in this book.<br /><br />The Dalai Lama then presents a series of seven steps to increase one's ability to feel love and compassion for an ever-growing class of people and sentient beings.  The process is presented in gradually expanding steps, and the reader can follow the path as it develops.  Each step is accompanied by teachings and by suggested meditation practices.  these seven steps are 1.creating a positive attitude towards others; 2. recognizing the kindnesses each of us has received; 3. reciprocating the kindness of others; 4. learning to love others (including learning the difference between disinterested love and love based upon attachment, such as physical or sensual desire or upon the receipt of benefits from those close to us); 5. practicing compassion, the desire to have others free from suffering; 6 becoming committed to altruism -- to training one's mind to and working for the welfare of others; and 7. realizing enlightenment in terms of being devoted to the welfare of others.<br /><br />The teachings in this book are in part guides that everyone can use regardless of his or her religious beliefs, and in part a simple exposition of the bodhisattva path of Mahayana Buddhism. The Dalai Lama makes frequent reference to ancient Indian and Tibetan sources, including the Tibetan \\"Stages on the Path to Enlightement\\" (pp 7-8), and the teachings of the great Indian sage, Nagarjuna (pp. 190 -- 197).  Each chapter of the book is headed by a short quotation from a Buddhist source that the Dalai Lama amplifies in the teachings that follow.<br /><br />This book is short and a pleasure to read, but there is no suggestion that the teachings are easy.  Work on the mind and on learning to love is a project of years and lives.  The Dalai Lama has written an inspiring guide tolearning to love.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanng guide to learning to love. <br /> <br />Robin Friedman  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-06

William Kinderman's essay: \\"The piano music: concertos, sonatas, variations, small forms\\" deals briefly but insightfully with Beethoven's body of work for the piano, focusing on the first three sonatas of opus 2, the \\"Waldstein and Appassionata\\" sonatas from Beethoven's mid-career, and the final three sonatas, opus nos. 109, 110, 111.  John Daverio's essay, \\"Manner, tone, and tendency in Beethoven's chamber music for strings\\" is a difficult study which uses literary and critical theory to show the differences between the quartets of Beethoven's early and middle period on the one hand and the final quartets on the other hand.  Both these essays were challenging and helped me with my listening.<br /><br />But I couldn't stop with the two essays and proceeded to read the entire book, part of a series which presents the best of musical scholarship and thought on the great composers.  This book of studies of Beethoven is edited by John Stanley of the University of Connecticut and consists of 17 essays by 16 scholars (Stanley has two essays) devoted to Beethoven's life and music.  If there is a theme running through this varied collection, it is that each essay tries to put Beethoven in a musical or historical context.<br /><br />The book is divided into four parts.  The first part, \\"A Professional Portrait\\" consists of three essays discussing Beethoven's life, his compositional techniques (the use of sketchbooks), and the traditional division of his works into three periods.  This part of the book includes a detailed and useful chronology of Beethoven's life.<br /><br />The second part of the book, \\"Style and Structure\\" consists of three essays which deal broadly with Beethoven's works and which discuss similarities and differences between Beethoven and Haydn and Mozart.  There is an excellent essay by Roger Kamien on Beethoven's use and development of thematic material which is technical but not beyond the reach of the devoted music lover.<br /><br />The third part of the book, called \\"Genres\\" consists of seven essays which examine each of the major genres in which Beethoven composed.  As I mentioned, the essays on the string quartets and the piano sonatas initially drew me to the book.  The remaining essays cover Beethoven's symphonies, focusing on his imaginative orchestration, the genesis of Beethoven's opera \\"Fidelio\\", the chamber music with piano, including the violin sonatas, cello sonatas, and trios and their development over Beethoven's career, the religious music, and the songs.  I particularly enjoyed this last essay by Amanda Glauert, \\"Beethoven's songs and vocal style\\" which traces Beethoven's songs from their origins in folk music and shows how Beethoven transformed the form.  Beethoven's songs, I think, still are insufficiently appreciated.<br /><br />The final section of the book, \\"Reception\\" consists of four essays which discuss the influence of Beethoven on other composers, different performance practices for Beethoven's music, the various ways in which Beethoven's music and personality have been viewed by the public (an excellent essay by Scott Burnham), and another excellent essay by David Dennis, concluding the book, which discusses Beethoven's influence on the arts, philosophy, and politics.<br /><br />In reading this volume of essays, I was reminded of the great appeal Beethoven has exerted, and continues to exert on many people.  Unlike most other composers of art music, his work has been an inspriation to people of all nationalities, ages, and walks of life from the most learned to the untutored.  His music has the capacity to draw listeners in, to make them involved, and to demand a response.  I got to know Beethoven's music, and something of his life, as a child and his hold upon me has continued.  This book helps to develop and to explain the devotion Beethoven continues to inspire.  As Scott Burnham states at the conclusion of his essay, \\"The Four Ages of Beethoven\\" (p.291)<br /><br />\\"Even now, after a century seemingly intent on annihilating all formerly comforting illusions of greatness and transcendent authority offered by the leading figures in our history, we have not yet managed to put the Beethoven myth behind us. For Beethoven continues to require that we grapple with him, continues to ask much of us, to call us out.  This, more than anything, is why we cannot let him go: his music remains a sounding provocation to what we are pleased to think of as our better selves.\\"<br /><br />This book will be of most immediate interest to those readers who already know Beethoven's music and who have read some of the many excellent basic studies of his life and works, such as the recent biographies by Maynard Solomon, Barry Cooper, and Lewis Lockwood, among others.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanto develop and to explain the devotion Beethoven continues to inspire.

This book by the noted Civil War historian Jeffry Wert is a fast-paced, engagingly written one-volume account of the Army of the Potomac from the beginning of the Civil War until General Robert E. Lee's surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomatox in April, 1865. This book is valuable for several reasons. As with any important historical event, the  meaning and significance of the Civil War is something that each generation and each reader must discover afresh for themselves.  Wert's account, even if it were found to include no additional factual information, encourages reflection on the Civil War, particularly on the role of the Union's most famous army, and on other histories of the conflict.  Furthermore Wert's account has a specific focus.  Wert discusses the special difficulties that plagued the Army of the Potomac over the course of the Civil War, explains the sources of these difficulties, and shows how the Army ultimately overcame them.  It is an inspiring story showing the value of persistence, commitment, and effort finding a goal, struggling to achieve it, and working to overcome adversity.  This approach to the Civil War is convincingly presented here.  Wert's heroes are the fighting soldiers in the Army of the Potomac as opposed, in general, to their frequently blundering leaders.<br /><br />The Army of the Potomac's original mission was the defense of Washington D.C.  That mission,and the proximity of the Army to the capital city, made the Army of the Potomac unduly visible and susceptible to political influence.  Wert shows the importance of these factors to the performance of the Army of the Potomac in the field.  The initial leadership of the Army, in particular the controversial General George McClellan, had a limited view of the aims of the conflict.  McClellan did an outstanding job of drilling and training the Army and of instilling a spirit of cameraderie in the troops. But McClellan fought the war simply as a means of bringing the South back into the Union. This outlook, perhaps, was as responsible for his timid, cautious approach as a commander as was his view of military strategy.<br /><br />Wert shows how McClellan's approach to the conflict, military and political, influenced the views of his successors as commanding generals: Pope (commander of the Army of Virginia) Burnside, Hooker, and Meade. Leadership of the Army had a cautious, defensive spirit and was subject of political interference.  President Lincoln took an active role with the Army and his specific decisions and criticisms were sometimes merited, but sometimes not.<br /><br />Wert gives a quick-paced account of the major battles of the Army, including First Bull Run, the Seven Days, Second Bull Run, Antietam, Fredricksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Mine Run, the Overland Campaign, Petersburg, and Appomatox.  In spite of the defeats or unsatisfactory results of most of these battles, Wert shows how the soldiers in the Army maintained their spirit, resiliency and sense of purpose.  Although they faced many dark days, the troops sensed that their mission was greater than their leaders.  They held on and continued against a spirited and well-lead opponent and ultimately were successful.  One major turning point occured following the Battle of the Wilderness when, after a dreadful two-day battle on the field on which Chancellorsville had been fought, U.S. Grant (commander of the entire Union forces who became the de facto commander of the Army of the Potomac) turned the Army towards the South to pursue Lee's Army rather than retreat northward as had been the practice of his predecessors.<br /><br />Wert offers clear and short accounts of the major battles of the Army of the Potomac without becoming bogged down in the detail of more lengthy histories. His purpose is less to explain military history than to show the spirit of the troops and the actions of their leaders.  Wert drives home well the hardships of the campaigns -- the sickness and unsanitary conditions of the camps, the terrors of battle, the long night marches -- and the determination of the troops to surmount them.  His account of the overland campaign in the summer of 1864, Wilderness, Spottsylvania, North Anna, and Cold Harbor, is especially compelling.<br /><br />Thus, even though he tells a story that has been told before, Wert's story will inspire the reader with its focus on the perseverance shown by the ordinary soldier and the face of extreme and protracted difficulty.  This book will make a good introduction to the Civil War for those readers new to the subject and also has much to teach those readers with a longstanding interest in this great conflict.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanlitary history than to show the spirit of the troops and the actions of their leaders.

US	48185764	R3GCTGEPAA1H9S	0520236556	505180671	Paul Bowles on Music: Includes the last interview with Paul Bowles	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Paul Bowles Reviews Music	I wanted to read this book of Paul Bowles's (1910 - 1999) music reviews for several reasons.  I am an admirer of Bowles's fiction, including the novel \\"The Sheltering Sky,\\" which he wrote as an expatriate American in Tangiers beginning in 1947.  Furthermore, before he began his career as a novelist, Bowles was a rising and prolific composer.  A self-taught protege of Aaron Copland, Bowles wrote ballets, suites, art songs, film scores, and scores for the theater, including plays by Tennessee Williams.  Music and literature are two of my passions.<br /><br />This leads me to the third reason for wanting to read this book.  Bowles spent several years reviewing music of all sorts, chiefly for the \\"New York Hearald Tribune\\" and for the periodical \\"Modern Music\\".  He wrote this work as a journalist, for little pay, and with tight deadlines.  Yet he managed to write well and to find something important to say.  It is this work-a-day world of writing that reminds me of my efforts, and those of my fellow reviewers, writing on this site  It is a challenge to write short pieces with regularity on subjects one loves and to try to produce something others will find valuable.  In short, Bowles's reviews, and his progress from composer to critic to novelist somehow became emblematic and inspirational to me of the Amazon reviewing process.<br /><br />In this book, Timothy Mangan and Irene Herrmann have gathered together Paul Bowles's music reviews written primarily from 1940--1946.  Bowles writes in a spare, understated, succinct style that will be familiar to readers of \\"The Sheltering Sky\\".  His reviews cover a broad spectrum and include reviews of scores for films, record releases, and concerts.  They cover too a wide range of music, including the then-recent works of Stravinsky, Leonard Bernstein, John Cage, and other contemporary classical composers, to folk music of Mexico, North Africa, South America, and Cuba, through American jazz and blues.  I was intrigued by his references to the blues singer Memphis Minnie (p. 230), the blues pianist Champion Jack Dupree (sings \\"with a fine primitive self-accompaniment on the piano\\", p.205), and Arthur Crudup (p.230) who would become the most direct and immediate influence on young Elvis Presley.<br /><br />Bowles's reviews give a lively picture of concert life in New York City during the war years as he describes for us the venues for music, and the performers and performances that he witnessed.  Many young composers and performers he reviewed were just starting out and would subsequently become famous, such as the 25 year old Leonard Bernstein (Bowles reviewed the premier of his \\"Jerimiah\\" symphony) and the young 18 year old pianist Eugene Istomin.  But he also reviewed concerts by composers and performers then considered to be of promise who have subsequently been forgotten.  It is good to remember these composers and flegling performers and their efforts.  The book allows the reader to see the manner in which musical tastes have changed from the 1940s to the present.<br /><br />Bowles was a composer and writes about music from a composer's viewpoint.  He writes eloquently about structures, harmonies, music periods, textures, interpretations and performance practices.  One can learn a good deal about listening intelligently to music from these reviews, even though the performances, and in some cases the music he describes, has long been forgotten.<br /><br />I noticed that Bowles had a predeliction for early music and, in particular for the music of the harpsichord.  In a review praising a 1942 concert by harpsichordist Ralph Kilpatrick, Bowles wrote: \\"it is difficult not to be enthusiastic over such a concert, if only because it involves the harpsichord itself, that antidote to the poison sounds of our era's daily life.  It is the instrument which allows every note of every voice of a piece of contrapuntal writing to be heard with complete clarity; remote and recessed as a voice may sound, itis never hidden.\\" (p.58)  In a 1991 interview included in this book, Bowles offered similar observations in discussing his reactions to the performances of Wanda Landowska (pp 267-269).  Bowles's criticism of \\"the poison sounds of our era's daily life,\\" echoed in many reviews in this collection, perhaps help explain his decision to leave New York City in favor of the life of an expatriate in Tangiers.<br /><br />Bowles decried what he viewed as a growing commercialization and uniformity in all types of music, from folk, to jazz to classical and cherished music as a way of life rather than as a casual entertainment.  It is fitting to quote the end of his final review, written in 1946, in which Bowles decried the increasingly sterile character of traditional folk music.  He wrote:<br /><br />\\"In Latin America as elsewhere, the radio and cinema are systematically exterminating folk music before its creators and consumers are in a position to participate in the creation or enjoymnent of art music.  What fills the gap? Commercial music.  But there are still thousands of small villages in that part of our hemisphere where radios and projectors have yet to arrive, and where the people still make their own music just as they have for centuries, not for entertainment, but because it is an absolute essential to their living.\\" (p.257)<br /><br />It is this ideal of music as \\"essential to living\\" that I found most lasting in these reviews by Paul Bowles.<br /><br />Robin Friedmansound, it is never hidden.\\" (p.58)  In a 1991 interview included in this book, Bowles offered similar observations in discussing his reactions to the performances of Wanda Landowska (pp 267-269).

US	48185764	R2Y5JVWMZFAYIK	0861713311	487032099	The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya	Books	5	129	129	N	N	The Samyutta Nikaya	The Samyutta Nikaya -- Connected Discourses of the Buddha -- is an integral work of the Pali Canon of Buddhism, the Scripture of Theravada Buddhism.  This work is also considered canonical by later schools of Buddhism.  The Connected Discourses is a lengthy, difficult work which focuses on philosophical teachings and on meditation practice.  It was probably written for advanced students unlike its companion volumes, the Mid-Length Discourses, (Majhima Nikaya) and the Long-Length Discourses (Digha Nikaya) also available in translation from Wisdom Publications.<br /><br />This work has been lucidly and beautifully translated by the American scholar-monk Bhikkhu Bodhi who also edited the Majhima.  Students of Buddhism are forever in his debt.  The Connected Discourses consists of five separate, lengthy books, each of which, except for the first book, concentrates on a specific aspect of the Buddha's teachings. All the teachings in the book center upon understanding of the four noble truths.  Each book is arranged in chapters with the suttas generally, but not always, presented in groups of ten.  The suttas are generally short and dense and lack the quality of story-telling found in the Long and Middle Discourses.  Bikkhu Bodhi has laboriously translated the text and prepared a general introduction to the entire book and an introduction to each of the five parts.  There are extensive footnotes, some of which are for the specialist and some of which are for the general reader, which draw in many cases upon the ancient commentaries to the text, together with a concordance and a bibliography.  It is an inspiration to have this volume available for study.<br /><br />There are many famous discourses in this collection, and I will try to mention some briefly.  The first book of the Connected Discourses consists of verses spoken by an interlocutor of the Buddha, frequently a deva or other supernatural being, and the Buddha himself.  These cover a range of subjects.  Probably the best-known Sutta in this part is the Sutta of Rahitassa, 2:26, in which the Buddha teaches that the end of the world can never be reached by walking but can only be understood through reflection on \\"this fathom-high carcass  endowed with perception and mind.\\"  Bikkhu Bodhi comments on this sutta that it \\"may well be the most profound proposition in the history of human thought.\\"<br /><br />The second book of the Connected Discourses deals in detail with the difficult doctrine of Dependent Origination which is basic to understanding the four noble truths and to the doctrines of non-self and impermanence. Sutta 12:23, sometimes titled \\"Transcendental Dependent Origination\\", is an important part of this collection which adds a component to the doctrine not found elsewhere in the texts.  It applies the teachings of Dependent Origination to the pursuit of enlightenment itself rather than only to the explanation of why people ordinarily remain emeshed in a web of delusion and ignorance.  This is a profound and important teaching.<br /><br />The third book of the Connected Discourses includes teachings on the five aggregates (form, feeling, perceptions, volitional formations, consciousness) which are the components of sentient existence.

One of the three earliest \\"cardinal discourses of the Buddha\\" delivered just after his enlightement is included in this book, at 22:59 which includes the Buddha's first exposition of the doctrine of nonself.<br /><br />The fourth book deals with the nature of the six sense bases  (sight, hearing, taste, touch, smell, consciousness) which are the means through which people understand physical reality.  This book includes another of the three cardinal discourses, the famous fire sermon, 35:28, which shows how people are emeshed in sense and need reflection and the Buddha's teachings for awakening.<br /><br />The final book is the longest of the collection and discusses the path to liberation.  It culminates in a discussion of the four noble truths and also includes lengthy treatments of meditation the seven factors of enlightenment, the role of faith in Buddhism, and practices for laymen.

At the time, Lincoln was heavily involved in helping Republican Congressional candidates, was still smarting from his 1858 defeat for the Senate by Stephen Douglas, and was a dark-horse, favorite son for the Republican presidential nomination. Lincoln accepted the invitation, worked painstakingly on the speech, and travelled to New York City to deliver what became the Cooper Union Address on February 27, 1860. (Lincoln was unaware that the venue for the speech had been changed until he arrived in New York.)  The speech and its aftermath brought Lincoln national attention.  It played a major role in allowing Lincoln to overtake the Republican front-runner, Senator William Seward of New York, and secure the nomination and the presidency.<br /><br />Harold Holzer is an independent scholar who, in the midst of a busy career at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has written or edited over twenty books about Lincoln.  His most recent book: \\"Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech that made Abraham Lincoln President\\" (2004) is a comprehensive account of the \\"momentous\\" Cooper Union Address, including (p. 1) \\"its impetus, preparation, delivery, reception, publication, calculated reiteration, and its enormous, perhaps decisive impact on that year's presidential campaign.\\" It is one of a number or recent books that examine in detail a specific Lincoln speech or proclamation, (such at the Gettysburg Address, Second Inaugural Address, Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln-Douglas debates.)  But the book does more.  It helps the reader understand Lincoln and the issues that lead to the Civil War.<br /><br />The Cooper Union speech was lengthy, scholarly, and factual and endeavored to show that a majority of the founders -- those that signed the Constitution -- believed that Congress had the right to regulate and prevent the spread of slavery into the territories.  This issue was central to the dispute between North and South and to Lincoln's debates with his great opponent, Senator Douglas. Holzer's book begins with a discussion of how Lincoln, the self-educated backwoods lawyer and stump speaker carefully researched this issue in an attempt to present a dispassionate yet morally committed approach to the issue of slavery.<br /><br />The book includes excellent accounts of the difficult and tiring nature of train travel during Lincoln's time, especially for an aspiring presidential candidate travelling to make a major address.  It includes fascinating discussions of the New York City of 1860 --Walt Whitman's New York -- and its docks, piers, hotels, and Broadway.  There is a wonderful account of Lincoln's visit while in the City to Five Points -- a notorious slum -- and a letter he subsequently received in the presidency from young men in a charitable school that he visited at the time.<br /><br />While in New York, Lincoln had a famous photograph taken by Matthew Brady. Brady's artistry made Lincoln look distinguished and presidential rather than like a tall, gangling shabbily dressed backwoodsman.  The Brady photo together with the speech helped bring Lincoln to public attention.<br /><br />In the heart of the book, Holzer offers a detailed analysis of the Cooper Union speech (the text is given in an appendix) and of Lincoln's delivery that fateful evening.  Although his audience was initially taken aback by the rough-hewn Lincoln, the substance of the speech and Lincoln's style of his delivery captivated the audience and made an astonishing impression.  Lincoln helped shepherd his text into print, and made  a hectic speaking tour of New England while visiting his son Robert at Exeter, thus furthering his position as a statesman of vision, integrity, and prudence.<br /><br />An interesting feature of the book is how Holzer reminds the reader of the fragilenature of historical accounts, including alleged eye-witness accounts.  Many times, Holzer points out a received account of the Cooper Union speech and shows in detail how the account is questionably supported or is inconsistent with other sources. (For example, there is a story that Erastus Corning, Director of the New York Central Railroad offered Lincoln the position as corporate counsel following the speech for the large salary of $10,000.  Holzer shows that this account lacks foundation.)  The book shows how historical sources need to be approached, used, and interpreted with caution.<br /><br />This book is an outstanding account of Lincoln in his complexity as a pragmatic, opportunistic and yet highly principled leader.  It gives a vivid picture of our country and its political life in 1860.  It considers issues about the nature of the Union and of human freedom that Lincoln addressed eloquently. These issues remain with us today.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanthe fragile nature of historical accounts, including alleged eye-witness accounts.

Bowles was an American but he lived in Tangiers, Morocco beginning in 1947.<br /><br />Bowles also was an American composer of art music and wrote scores for the plays of Tennessee Williams, a writer I admire greatly.  Thus I was pleased to have the opportunity to read Bowles's great novel, \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" (1949).  It is, indeed, a remarkable book and captures well moods and feelings that are all-too-common.<br /><br />Bowles's novel is set in North Africa at the close of WW II.  There are three primary characters: a married couple, Port and Kit, and their friend Tunner.  Port and Kit are educated, intelligent, and financially comfortable.  They have been married for twelve years, most of which has been spent in aimless<br /><br />wandering to obscure places.  They decide to visit North Africa and their friend Tunner, a newsman, accompanies them.  The novel begins upon their arrival and remorselessly chronicles the deterioration and destruction of Port and Kit.<br /><br />The story is told in spare, understated prose and moves  easily. The destruction of the characters unfolds slowly and in detail.  The book presents a compelling portrait of  outsiders -- of people who are alone, alienated from their families and friends and their own societies with no sense of purpose for themselves.  In part, the book amplifies upon the theme of the \\"Lost Generation\\" following WW I and explores subjects, but with a far greater degree of discipline and restraint, that the Beat writers would also explore.<br /><br />We don't learn many details about the protagonists -- about the reasons for their estrangements and feelings.  The marriage of Port and Kit is deeply troubled as they sleep in separate rooms and have difficulty talking. An inevitable triangle develops with Kit and Tunner becoming lovers for an instant. During the book, both Port and Kit takes steps to become closer to the other -- with Kit filled with remorse for her affair with Tunner -- but to little avail.  The book moves with the force of doom as Port dies midway in the book and Kit, after a series of harrowing experiences, descends into madness.<br /><br />There are vivid pictures in the book of the Sahara Desert, of many towns, trains, hotels, and buses in North Africa and of a host of secondary characters, including French military officials, native inhabitants, and other wanderers of bad or uncertain purpose.  We see the shallowness and foolishness of our three travelers in venturing witlessly into a forbidding land that they don't understand.  But this book is far more than a conventional story of a clash of cultures.  It shows people who are hollow and adrift inside meeting a terrible fate brought about by their own fundamental ignorance.<br /><br />This is a tough-minded and terse book.  It taught me about the place and much more about the characters and their condition.  The events of the book are sad and disquieting in the extreme.  But I felt a certain sense of catharsis, understanding, and release upon the conclusion.<br /><br />Robin Friedmaniangle develops with Kit and Tunner becoming lovers for an instant.

Chanu is striving for a promotion, is proud of his attempts to secure education, and is portrayed at the outset of the book as rather vain and foolish.  Bangladeshi society and traditional Islamic practices are patriarchal by western lights, and much is made of this throughout the book.  Nanzeen and Chanu have a son, who dies as an infant, and two daughters Shahana and Bibi.  Mid-way in the book, with her growth in independence and awareness of her physical and emotional needs, Nanzeen takes a lover, a young man and would-be Islamic radical named Karim.  Nanzeen has a beautiful younger sister, Hasina, who remains in Bangladesh, and writes many letters to her sister in a broken English about the course of her life and its hardships.<br /><br />The book gives a portrait of life of the Bangladeshi immigrant community in London.  I had no prior knowledge of this community.  It describes how the immigrants lived in cramped living conditions in the poorer sections of town with up to ten people per room trying to support themselves in a culture utterly foreign to most of them.  Some of the people work at assimilation while others try to retain their religious and Bangladeshi identity.  Drugs and violence come to plague the community and, of course, the open sexual mores of modern London prove irresistable to many.  The community is shown as divided in its response to the terrorism that has come to dominate world news in recent years.<br /><br />There are a host of well-drawn secondary characters in this novel, including the loan-shark, Mrs. Islam, Nanzeen's lover, named Karim, a friend of Chanu named Dr. Azad, and Razia, a friend of Nanzeen.  These characters give weight and texture to the novel and partly succeed in bringing it to life.<br /><br />The book focuses on Nanzeen's development, and the parallel development of Hasina, as it involves Nanzeen's husband, her lover, and, ultimately her independence.  It also centers upon Chanu's and Nanzeen's differing desires in terms of returning to Bangladesh.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the excellence of the 100-some discussions by my fellow Amazon reviewers and by the wide divergence of considered responses to this book.  Reading the reviews helped me focus upon my own response to the book.  Many reviewers found this novel an outstanding first attempt to describe the immigrant experience of the Bangladeshis and the personal growth of the heroine.  Other readers found the novel vastly overpraised, difficult, and trite.  There is something to be said for both views, but on the whole I agree with the latter opinion.  I was happy to have it reinforced by a substantial group of fellow reviewers.<br /><br />The book does portray eloquently the difficulties of the Bangladeshi immigrant community and provokes reflection on how many individuals, in immigrating to a new land, respond to the various choices of assimilation on the one hand and remaining deeply attached to one's initial identity on the other hand.  Some of the characters in this book are convincingly drawn.  But these are largely the secondary characters, such as Mrs. Islam and Dr. Azad, and also, surprisingly enough, Chanu, Nanzeen's husband.<br /><br />The problems with this book far outweigh its virtues. To begin with, I found it far too long, too slow, and, in many places, dull.  It was an unrelieved chore to finish this book.  The long sections of letters to Nazneen from her sister Hasina break up the story are difficult to read and detract much more than they add.<br /><br />Equally important, the character on whom Ms. Ali lavishes most of her attention, Nazneen, is trite and unconvincing.  I don't think we need another long novel to inform the reader that traditional Islamic society is patriarchal.  At times, both at the beginning and at the end of the story, the book does little more than that.  Portions of the Nanzeen's development show more depth, as Nanzeen learns of her sexuality and also stands up to Mrs. Islam.  But the main theme of the book is predictable and boring and has been done many times in many other contexts.<br /><br />While Nazneen's development shows predictable stereotyping, the author, possibly in spite of herself does a better job with Chanu who for all his faults is a complexly drawn human being deserving of compassion and, perhaps, of a better fate.<br /><br />Thus, in spite of some good moments, I cannot recommend this book due to its length and structure and due to its stereotyped plot line and heroine.  I found it worthwhile to review the comments of my fellow reviewers and to offer my own comments here.<br /><br />Robin Friedmananother long novel to inform the reader that traditional Islamic society is patriarchal.

The Heart Sutra is chanted several times daily at Mahayana Buddhist monasteries and temples throughout the world. It is work that will reward repeated and sustained attention.  The Heart Sutra has been the subject of extensive commentary, both ancient and modern.  One of the finest modern commentaries is the work of the American scholar and translator Red Pine which I will discuss in this review.<br /><br />Red Pine's translation and commentary on the Heart Sutra is a worthy successor to Pine's earlier translation and commentary on the Diamond Sutra, a work emanating from the same \\"Perfection of Wisdom\\" group of Buddhist teachings as does the Heart Sutra. Both of Pine's studies work carefully and closely with the text, and both helped me in my approach to these difficult teachings.<br /><br />Pine's study opens with his own translation of the text of the Heart Sutra.  This is followed by an introduction in which Pine discusses what is known about the composition, date, and original language of the work.  He reviews some of the scholarly controversies over these matters and places the origin of the Sutra in Nortwest India in about 150 A.D.  He believes that the work was originally written in Sanskrit, in contrast to some recent scholars who believe it of Chinese origin.<br /><br />Pine follows his historical review with an overview of the text and its purpose.  Fundamentally, the Heart Sutra is concerned with teaching wisdom rather than mere knowledge. Specifically, the Sutra is concerned with transcendent wisdom which, as Pine explains it,  \\"is based on the insight that all things, both objects and dharmas, are empty of anything self-existent.  Thus, nothing can be characterized as permanent, pure or having a self. And yet, neither can anything be characterized as impermanent, impure, or lacking a self.\\" (p. 21)  The wisdom of the Heart Sutra lies beyond mere reasoning and is in the realm of insight and sustained meditation and ethical practice.  Pine makes this point eloquently, and it is basic to approaching the Heart Sutra.<br /><br />Pine divides the Heart Sutra into four sections each of which are explored in the four commentarial sections of his book.  Each section includes a line-by-line discussion of the text of the Heart Sutra, beginning with Pine's own comments followed by the comments of other students of the work, both ancient and modern.<br /><br />The first part of the work (lines 1-11) set the backdrop of the Heart Sutra in the philosophical commentary of earlier Buddhist tradition known as the Abhidharma. Pine finds the Heart Sutra was written to correct the overly rationalistic approach of certain Abhidharmic texts. In this section, Pine describes briefly the nature of Abhidharmic thought and relates it to the protagonists of the Heart Sutra: Avalokiteshvara, the principle bohdisattva of Mahayana Buddhism who is usually seen as the figure of universal compassion, Prajnaparamita, a name both for the teachings of Mahayana Buddhism and of the goddess who personifies these teachings, and Shariputra, the Buddha's chief disciple who receives the teaching  of Prajnaparamita from Avalokiteshvara in the Heart Sutra.<br /><br />The second part of the Heart Sutra, (lines 12-20) consists of a discussion of the conceptual categories of the Abhidharma, which the teachings of the Heart Sutra reject (or transform).  Pine's commentary expands upon the nature of these categories, allowing the reader a means of approaching the key teaching of the Sutra that \\"form is emptiness emptiness is form.\\"<br /><br />The third part of the Heart Sutra in Pine's study, lines 21-28, discuss the bodhisattva path to wisdom and to the realization of Buddhahood, constrasting these goals with the goals of Arahantship and Nirvana in earlier Buddhist teachings. These lines teach that bodhisattvas are \\"without attainment\\" and that they live \\"without walls of the mind\\".  Pine's commentary casts light on this difficult and suggestive teaching and way of understanding.<br /><br />The fourth and final part of Pine's analysis deal with lines 29-35 of the Heart Sutra including the obscure mantra with which it concludes: \\"Gate, gate, paragate,parsangate, bodhi svaha.\\"  In his commentary, Pine discusses the meaning and significance of this mantra and its relationship to the rest of the text.  According to Pine, this mantra \\"reminds and empowers us to go beyond all conceptual categories. ... With this incantation ringing in our minds, we thus enter the goddess Prajnaparamita, and await our rebirth as Buddhas\\". (p. 7)<br /><br />The study concludes with a useful glossary of terms and of people mentioned in the text and with a translation of a slightly later and longer version of the Heart Sutra.<br /><br />In its detail and concentration, this book would not be the best choice for the beginning student of Buddhism.  But for those readers with some basic grounding in the earlier forms of Buddhism which the Heart Sutra critiques and with the Mahayana tradition this book is invaluable.  It is a book to be read and studied.  Pine gives a thoughtful, well-organized, and learned account of the Heart Sutra that will help the reader approach this seminal text.d\\".

Hahn is a Professor of American History at the University of Pennsylvania, and his book received, and justly so, the Pulitzer Prize, the Bancroft Prize and the Merle Curti Prize in Social History.<br /><br />The purpose of Professor Hahn's study is to show how African Americans from their earliest days in the South attempted to organize to take control of their own destiny.  The book challenges the view of many historians that African American political activism was predominantly only a reaction to white oppression and to the unwillingness of Southern whites to have African Americans assume a full role in political life.<br /><br />Professor Hahn's book is arranged chronologically in three broad Parts.  Part I covers African American political activity during the pre-Civil War and Civil War period.  He describes how blacks, even in the condition of slavery, used their position to wrest  concessions from the slaveholders, including the right to  farm their own plots, to make limited sales of produce, and to visit neighboring plantations.  He describes the growth of an informational network during these years, an early commitment to education to literacy, and the beginnings of a political organization.  These early efforts intensified during the Civil War with the advance of Union Armies in the South, the defection of many slaves, and the service of Southern African Americans in the Union Army.<br /><br />The second part of the book covers the complexities of the Reconstruction period from the close of the War through about 1877.  This is the heart of Hahn's account, and it has been influenced heavily by Eric Foner, W.E.B. DuBois, and John Hope Franklin.  Professor Hahn shows the strong efforts of many African Americans throughout the South to take control of their destinies and to make active and responsible contributions to the body politic.  During this period, African Americans had many leaders who had been slaves or free blacks prior to the War and who had acquired literacy and political ability.  They achieved a degree of success for a time in different parts of the South but their efforts were doomed by Southern Paramilitary movements, such as the Ku Klux Klan, and by the unwillingness of the United<br /><br />States government to stand wholeheatedly behind black civil rights.  Professor Hahn tells a chilling story of murder and political intimidation which, as did the efforts of the black leadership, had its roots in the years before the Civil War.<br /><br />Part three of the book covers the years following the end of Reconstruction, a period which sometimes is greatly oversimplified.  Even with the end of Reconstruction, African Americans made efforts to empower themselves by forging alliances with white groups.  During the first decade or so following Reconstruction, Southern whites were sufficiently divided among themselves to allow African Americans a degree of political leverage and power.  Also during these years, there was an active black emigrationist movement which encouraged blacks to move to Liberia or to a location outside the South -- such as Kansas.  And this movement had some limited success in forcing concessions from economic powers in the South.  Again, the political structure African Americans created during this time survived the Jim Crow era in the South and contributed directly to the Great Migration to the North of the twentieth Century and, ultimately to the Civil Rights Movement of the mid-twentieth century.  Professor Hahn has interesting and largely sympathetic things to say about Marcus Garvey and his movement in the 1920s for the repartriation of American blacks to Liberia.<br /><br />This study is dense, highly detailed, and thoroughly documented.  Professor Hahn displays a wealth of learning in the primary literature and in secondary studies.  The footnote documentaion is extensive.  This book is probably not suitable for the reader coming to this subject matter for the first time.  The book makes for heavy reading and it presupposes some basic knowledge in the reader about slavery, the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the many post-reconstruction movements in Southern politics in the different Southern states.  It seems to me as well that the book owes a considerable debt to C Vann Woodward's study, now over 50 years old, &#34;The Origins of the New South 1877 -- 1913&#34; which covers some of the same material on African American political activism.  Professor Hahn has written an outstanding work of American History, African American History, and Southern History.

But Americans have their own hallowed places which have a secular and a spiritual significance in inspiring reflection on our nation's history and values.  Although some hallowed sites (such as Independence Hall or the Statue of Liberty) are not battlefields, many of them are.  In this book, \\"Sacred Ground: Americans and their Battlefields\\" Professor Edward Linenthal tells their story.  Appropriately enough, Professor Linenthal is a professor of Religious Studies, (rather than, say, history), at the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh.<br /><br />Professor Linethal describes the history of five of our country's most revered battlefields: Lexington and Concord, which marks the opening of the Revolutionary War, the Alamo, part of the war for Texan independence, Gettysburg, a pivotal Civil War battle, Little Big Horn, the scene of \\"Custer's Last Stand\\", and Pearl Harbor, the scene of Japan's December 7, 1941, attack which brought the United States into WW II.<br /><br />Professor Linenthal begins his consideration of each battlefield with a short -- I think too short -- summary of the facts of each battle.  He then proceeds to discuss in detail the manner in which Americans have commemorated and remembered the events that occured and why they have viewed them as significant.  Much of his study involves reflections on the nature of history as memory and history as it occurred -- a subject which has recently received a great deal of attention.  He shows how many Americans have had a need to commemorate these battles for a set of reasons that may only be partial -- and that commemorative activities change and expand as people's perceptions change and become more inclusive.<br /><br />Professor Linenthal points out, Gettysburg has been celebrated because of the valor of the combatants, North and South, and because of the role reunions and commemorations at Gettysburg played in effecting sectional reconciliation  -- at the expense of realizing an important purpose of the Civil War in ending slavery and bringing African-Americans into full participation in American democracy.  The Alamo has been celebrated as a symbol of American valor and love of freedom; yet the celebration has downplayed the important role played by Mexican Texans in the struggle as well as many questions that could be raised about the conduct of the United States in the wars with Mexico.  The Little Big Horn Battlefield has been the site of protracted controversy over the United States's Indian policy, leading to sharp conflict between General Custer's admirers and his opponents and, ultimately, to a renaming of the battlefield.  Pearl Harbor has had controversies regarding the factors which lead to the surprise attack, the Hiroshima bombing, and the attitude of people in the United States towards the Japanese.  Lexington and Concord have been appropriated by some Americans as symbols of dissent from current American policies (as the minutement rebelled against the British) rather than as celebrations of the willingness of Americans to fight and die for freedom.<br /><br />The story is told well and thoughtfully with good, if sometimes overwhelming detail.  Professor Linenthal gives a great deal of attention to the role of the National Park Service (which is responsible for all the sites discussed in his study with the exception of the Alamo) in balancing the competing needs for site preservation, historical interpretation, and contemplation in administering the battlefields.  I found the discussion of Little Big Horn particularly fascinating and complex.  The reader needs to know more, however, about the Little Big Horn and about Custer to fully understand the discussion.  Interestingly, Custer is the only person to figure prominently in two of the battles Linenthal discusses: Gettysburg and Little Big Horn, and the book should have brought this out.<br /><br />This book initially appeared in 1989 with a second edition that takes the story through 1993 -- time enough to include the 50-year anniversary of Pearl Harbor in which Professor Linenthal participated.  The story could be brought up to date.  This book is still a valuable study of the meaning, and of the changes in meaning, that Americans invest in their sacred spaces.scusses: Gettysburg and Little Big Horn, and the book should have brought this out.   <br /> <br />This book initially appeared in 1989 with a second edition that takes the story through 1993 -- time enough to include the 50-year anniversary of Pearl Harbor in which Professor Linenthal participated.

Paine describes how Merton's initial skepticism towards the Tibetan form of Buddhism quickly vanished and how Merton came to think that this then-obscure sect of Buddhism might \\"spiritually reanimate\\" (p.8) the West.<br /><br />Following his exploration of Tibetan Buddhism's reception in the West, Paine discusses (pp. 257-259) three factors that he believes have influenced many people in the West in their search for spiritual renewal: 1. universality and nonpartisanship, by which Paine means that this esoteric Buddhist sect has been transformed in the West to a religion accessible to people of all backgrounds, races, and creeds; 2. individual responsibility, by which Paine means the emphasis given in all schools of Buddhism to individuals working towards their own enlightenment; and 3.heightened capabilities, or the hope Tibetan Buddhism holds out of deepening one's understanding of oneself and reaching new spiritual depths.  Paine concludes that \\"even if Tibetan Buddhism disappeared tomorrow, it would have meanwhile enriched numerous lives and renewed appreciation for what spirituality is.\\" (p. 260)<br /><br />This is an inspiring vision indeed, and there is much in Paine's study and to teach.  Paine introduces the reader to a mixed group of seekers who helped bring Tibetan Buddhism to westerners searching for a revitalized form of spirituality.  The prominent characters include Alexandra David-Neel, a woman who made a hazardous journey to Lhasa in the 1920s, while in her mid-50s, overcame her own skepticism, and helped spread early knowledge of Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism, Diane Perry, an English woman raised in the slums who became a Tibetan Buddhist nun named Tenzin Palmo and spent 12 years meditating in a cave in Tibet, Lama Thubten Yeshe, one of the first Tibetan lamas to attempt to teach Westerners, the American Harold Talbot, one of the first Americans to study in Tibet and the founder of a publishing house, and, of course primarily, the Dalai Lama himself.  The book also discusses other important figures with a mixed influence including Chogyam Trungpa, a former Tibetan monk who became highly influential in the United States but whose life and particularly that of his successor was tainted by sexual, alcoholic, and financial scandal, and Catherine Burroughs, the founder of a large Tibetan center outside Washington, D.C. who has been described in Martha Sherrill's highly critical book, \\"The Buddha from Brooklyn\\" (2000)<br /><br />There is much to be learned from this account, and Paine does not hesitate to point out the scandals that have plagued Tibetan Buddhism in the West, or its adoption by a host of Hollywood and media types.  But he also points out that there is something fresh and alive in the movement and that, transplanted and Westernized, Tibetan Buddhism, has brought awakened many people of differing backgrounds -- including secularists -- to possibilities of spiritual growth within themselves.<br /><br />Paine's book lacks the detail and breadth of a scholarly study.  His decision not to include at least a basic bibliography was unfortunate.  More importantly, the book does not give much of an account of the teachings of Buddhism and of the specific teachings of Tibetan Buddhism.  Such an account, of course, is essential to understanding how this form of Buddhism has itself been transformed by its contact with the West.  There is also some tendency, common to many writers on this subject, towards idealization of Tibetan Buddhism -- a too quick attempt to project some of the needs and values of Western secularism onto a religious teaching from a much different source.<br /><br />Paine's study, I think, is too quick and too heady, but still valuable.  I recommend that those readers wanting a more scholarly andsober account of the doctrinal bases of Tibetan Buddhism, as transferred to the West, see the many books of Professor David Lopez.

One of the students was asked what purpose this attention served during the times the Rebbe was not engaged in teaching.  The Hasid replied that \\"I don't follow the Rebbe just to hear him teach. I follow him to learn how he ties his shoe-laces\\".<br /><br />I was reminded of this story in reading Victor Chan's account of his meetings with H.H. the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism.  Mr. Chan wants to impress upon the reader the force of associating with a holy person.  There is much to be learned from the contact with such a person, with observing his demeanor, small talk, daily routines and attitudes towards others.  Spiritual growth and inspiration can be imparted from these contacts, just as with formal teachings.<br /><br />Mr. Chan first met the Dalai Lama in 1972 in a roundabout, virtually accidental way following his graduation from college. He subsequently became interested in Buddhism and Tibet, writing a travel guidebook to the latter, and gaining the confidence and friendship of the Dalai Lama.  Mr. Chan's book, \\"The Wisdom of Forgiveness\\" consists of nineteen short chapters in which he accompanies the Dalai Lama on various journeys, interviews him repeatedly and at length, and shares in his day-to-day activities.<br /><br />Thus, the book shifts from place-to-place as Mr Chan joins the Dalai Lama on trips to Ireland, Norway, on pilgrimages to Buddhist holy sites in India, and in the Dalai Lama's headquarters in Dharamsala, India.  We meet many members of the Dalai Lama's entourage, including interpreters, advisors, and bodyguards, as well as a variety of other people famous, such as Desomond Tutu and Oprah Winfrey, and obscure.<br /><br />The book gives a good picture of the Dalai Lama in teaching and in character.  In his discussions with Mr. Chan, he discusses at length the value of a gracious and forgiving heart particularly as it involves in the Dalai Lama's own case the Chinese communists who overran Tibet in the 1950s and destroyed its holy places.  We also receive teachings on emptiness and on controlling one's mind.<br /><br />The book shows admirably the Dalai Lama's sometimes unpredictable sense of humor, his ability to put people at ease, the unpretentious manner in which he wears his learning and his practice, his serenity, and his devotion.  We learn a great deal of the Dalai Lama in the closing chapters of the book when we see him respond to a serious, potentially fatal illness.  There are also good moments in the final chapters of the book when the Dalai Lama turns the tables on Mr. Chan and asks him questions on what Buddhism has meant to him and on how his contact with the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people has influenced his life.<br /><br />The book is a bit short, and Mr Chan seems to wander at times.  I would have liked to hear more of the Dalai Lama. Thus, I think some of the books in which the Dalai Lama speaks and teaches for himself are a better way of getting to know him than is this account.  Still, this book is worth reading.<br /><br />The title of the book, and much of its early chapters, concentrate on the importance of being able to forgive.  A famous verse in the \\"Dhammapada\\", a collection of short verses which is part of the Scripture of all forms of Buddhism speaks eloquently of the importance of forgiveness and of not bearing grudges.  It reads:<br /><br />  He abused me, he stuck me, he overpowerered me<br /><br />  he robbed me.  Those who harbour such thoughts<br /><br />  do not still their hatred.

US	48185764	R2NRNWOM1T4OAJ	0142180114	683414812	The Black Prince (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Murdoch's Black Prince	This is a thoughtful, difficult novel that explores the ambiguities of human character and the complex relationship between art and passion.  Dame Iris Murdoch (1919 --1999) was both a philosopher and a prolific novelist.  She wrote \\"The Black Prince\\" in 1973.  A subsequent novel, \\"The Sea, The Sea\\" received the Booker Prize.<br /><br />The book revolves around several complex characters.  The hero is an author, and retired tax inspector, Bradley Pearson, age 58 at the time most of the action of the book takes place.  He has published only sparingly but prides himself as a serious author. Most of the story is told by Bradley.<br /><br />Bradley has long been divorced, but his ex-wife Christian is a major character in the book, as she reenters Bradley's life after the death of her second husband. Christian's brother, Francis Marloe, is a failed physician who offers advice and assistance, of a mixed quality, to Bradley during the story. Bradley is a long-term friend of the Baffin family, which includes Arnold, a highly successful writer of fiction, his wife Rachael, and their 20-year old daughter Julian.  The story revolves around the 58-year old Bradley's love and passion for the 20-year old Julian. As the story unfolds Bradley's sister, Pricilla, is leaving her husband and comes to Bradley for emotional support and assistance. Bradley is put to the test about how he will respond to his sister.<br /><br />The other major character in Murdoch's novel is an editor, \\"P.A. Loxias', who becomes Bradley's friend and the editor of Bradley's manuscript that Bradley wrote recounting his love affair with young Julian. The manuscript forms the body of the book.  Bradley wrote the book after the fact, while in prison for a crime he did not commit.  Loxias both introduces and closes the book, while Christian, Rachael, and Julian get brief opportunities to write for themselves and to comment upon Bradley's manuscript.  This \\"Penguin Classics\\" reprint of the book also includes an introduction by the noted philosopher Martha Nussbaum which is unusually detailed and, perhaps, could be read as yet another editorial comment on Bradley's story that might well have been part of Murdoch's text.<br /><br />The story is full of ambiguity, vacillation in its characters, and violence and thus is almost a retelling of Hamlet -- Shakespeare's play that figures prominently in this book.  Another main influence on the book is Plato, particularly his great dialogue \\"Phaedrus\\" which explores the relationship between art, erotic love, and rhetoric, as this novel does as well.  It is always good to be reminded of and to think about Plato.  A third, less obvious influence, I think is Buddhism. The influence of Buddhist thought on Murdoch is explicit in her novel \\"The Sea, The Sea\\" but it is here as well.  The book can almost be read as an illustration of the three basic traits of existence as developed in Buddhist thought: suffering (dukka), change, and egolessness.  Bradley and the other characters struggle to see the world and other people clearly but are prevented from doing so by their own passions and self-concepts.<br /><br />Bradley achieves a Buddhist-like detachment near the end as he reflects upon his experiences.<br /><br />In reading the book, I found it helpful to distinguish clearly between the body of the story that Bradley recounts and the time that he wrote it, some years afterwards, while left alone with himself to reflect.  Bradley was swept with passion for a relationship that could not have lasted, that he did not fully understand, and that lead to tragedy for many people.  Yet this passion helped him, in the final analysis, attain a degree of peace and understanding.  He was able to tell the truth in writing his story and to present himself, terrible warts and all.  Love lead to great human sorrow for Bradly, but it also lead to his ability to present his experience in the form of art and to reflect upon it dispassionately.<br /><br />Portions of this book are rather wordy and inner directed.  It needs to be read carefully. But I found it an inspiring treatment of the nature of human erotic passion and its force for life.  The book will appeal to readers willing to reflect and to explore themselves./>Portions of this book are rather wordy and inner directed.  It needs to be read carefully.

The changes wrought by the Civil Rights, women's, environmental, and anti-war movements are well-known.  Perhaps less well-known, but of great importance, are the changes brought about by American Indian Tribes as they sought to organize their governments, implement and determine their treaty rights, and revitalize their traditional cultures.  The story of tribal self-determination is told with eloquence and passion by Professor Charles Wilkinson in his recent book, \\"Blood Struggle: The Rise of Modern Indian Nations\\" (2005).  Professor Wilkinson is a Distinguished University Professor at the University of Colorado School of Law and the author of twelve books dealing with Indian affairs and with the American West.  He is also a distinguished advocate and has worked as counsel to many Indian tribes on matters discussed in this book.<br /><br />In his comprehensive and readable history, Professor Wilkinson places the self-determination movement against the backdrop of earlier Indian policy.  He begins with the General Allotment Act of 1887 in which Congress provided for the division of Reservation lands to individual Indians with the goal of assimilating the Indians into the broader society and selling-off the tribal land base.  He follows this with a discussion of Indian policy during the New Deal which partly reversed this trend but which lead to the policy of termination in the 1950s and early 1960s.  The termination policy was also assimilationist in nature and had the goal of ending Federal supervision of and the special Federal relationship to Indian tribes.  The tribes succeeded in reversing the termination policy when, in 1973, Congress passed a law restoring the Federal relationship to the Menominee Tribe of Wisconsin.  Professor Wilkinson was instrumental in securing this legislation.<br /><br />Professor Wilkinson offers an intellectual, legal, and cultural history of Indian self-determination. His book is full of stories and anecdotes of tribal people and their leaders: this multi-dimensional approach brings his study to life.  I learned a great deal from his discussion of the work of three influential Indian writers: Charles Eastman, Black Hawk, (primarily in the famous book \\"Black Elk Speaks\\" by John Neihardt) and Darcy McNickle. Wilkinson's treatment of these writers provides a good understanding to the tribal movement and is frequently overlooked in other treatments of this subject.<br /><br />Professor Wilkinson offers well-paced accounts of the Indian attempted takeovers at Alcatraz and of portions of the BIA buildings in Washington, D.C. in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The book discusses, with the perspective of the insider, the salmon fishing litigation in the Northwest in which tribes secured a recognition of their treaty rights (the \\"Boldt\\" decision), the story of Indian land claims in the Northeast, tribal efforts to restore land unjustly taken from them and much else.  He discusses the shifting fortunes of Indian litigants in recent years before the Supreme Court of the United States.  The book also covers tribal business endeavors in such areas as forest management, resorts, oil and gas pipelines, and most recently and controversially, casino gambling.<br /><br />Professor Wilkinson writes with a mastery of his subject and a deep commitment to the rightness of Indian causes.  This is the source of great strength and eloquence in the book but also the source of some questions. At times, Professor Wilkinson doesn't let the reader see that there are (at least) two sides to every question.  Too often, objections to the tribal position in various matters are swept aside or belittled. Tribal positions on various separate issues are indiscriminately lumped together with little effort to distinguish what is valuable with what is questionable.  In his effort to set forth what he deems to be the values of Indianculture ( a slow-pace of life, living close to the land, a spiritual tie to land and community, environmentalism) Professor Wilkinson perhaps simplifies and romanticizes many individual cultures which differ widely from each other. Conversely, he oversimplifies and is overly critical of life in the broader United States which Professor Wilkinson finds conformist, materialistic, and destructive, and intolerant of differences.  There is too much easy caricature here on both sides and, I think, too great a stress on the values of ethnicity and nationalism.  The interplay and relationship between a traditional and a common culture is an important question faced by every group in the United States and deserves closer thought than it receives in this study.<br /><br />Professor Wilkinson's study teaches a great deal about the development of Indian tribes and institutions in our recent history.  The book held my interest and deeply moved me.  It will encourage the reader to think about a part of our Nation's history and its present that is too often ignored.f Indian culture ( a slow-pace of life, living close to the land, a spiritual tie to land and community, environmentalism) Professor Wilkinson perhaps simplifies and romanticizes many individual cultures which differ widely from each other.

US	48185764	R2HUWFJPOCTWA2	0385510217	40319694	Why the Jews Rejected Jesus: The Turning Point in Western History	Books	4	154	165	N	N	A Study of Judaism and Christianity	David Klinghoffer wrote his recent book \\"Why the Jews Rejected Jesus\\" (2005) in response to Mel Gibson's movie \\"The Passion of the Christ\\".  The major purpose of the book is stated in the title:  to explain why the Jews, or most of them, continued with their Jewish religion and practices and refused to accept Jesus as the Messiah.  Klinghoffer is a practicing Jew who was raised in a non-observant home and came to take Judaism seriously during his college years.  He is also a political conservative which, for me, is refreshing.  He has written, on the whole, a solid interesting study showing extensive reading and thought.  There is much to be learned from this book.  Unfortunately, portions of the book are unduly polemical.  Klinghoffer goes out of the way, frequently, to be provocative.  In addition, the tenor and theme of the book tend to shift as the study goes along.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but the reader needs to be aware of it and to see it happening.  Klinghoffer greatly overstates the originality of his work, but this is common enough among writers.<br /><br />There is something to surprise every reader in this book.  Klinghoffer begins by noting that Jewish traditional texts include materials about Jesus that is frequently suppressed.  Some of these materials suggest that some leaders of the Jewish community did indeed play a role in the death of Jesus.  I had not realized this before, and Klinghoffer is to be comended for his candor in making this information available to a wider readership.<br /><br />The question remains of the reasons which compelled the Jews to stay with their own faith.  Here Klinghoffer gives a variety of answers which could have been organized more coherently.  Jews believed, Klinghoffer argues, that they had a relationship with God revealed at Sinai and set out in the written Torah and in the Oral Torah -- later codified as the Talmud.  Jesus and his followers denied the Torah in key respects that could not be accepted by Jews.  Also, Klinghoffer claims, the arrival of the Messiah was to be accompanied by a change in the world, in  human attitude and conduct and in the end of opression. But Jesus did not remove the yoke of Rome, and the world went on as it had before.<br /><br />The book includes a great deal of discussion of proof-texts -- verses from the Old Testament that many Christians have claimed prophesy the coming of Jesus.  Klingoffer offers a laborious view of these texts and of Jewish responses to them.  He shifts during the course of his study from the claim that the texts couldn't possibly mean what Christians say they mean to a claim that the texts are difficult, obsure and oracular and that reasonable people can differ about what they mean.  For me, the use of proof-texts is based either on a literalist or traditionalist view of revelation and of Scriptural interpretation that have little appeal for me.  But others may differ.<br /><br />As the book progresses, it takes a more ecumenical, inclusive approach.  Klinghoffer discusses medieval and early modern Jewish philosophy which attempted to create a bridge of sorts between the two faiths.  Both Jews and Christians worship the same God and both have a place, for believers, in God's scheme of things.  Jews are the people of the Covenant while Christians approach God through Jesus.  This was essentially the approach of the great Twentienth Century Jewish thinker, Franz Rosenzweig (1886-1929).  Klinghoffer discusses Rosenzweig briefly (pp 200-201), but it would have been well to hear more.  Klinghoffer finds that both Judaism and Christianity are of almost equal stature and nobility, and both faiths constitute ways in which a religious person can learn to worship and serve God.  This is a valuable and serious teaching, but it represents a shift from the polemics and the scriptural hair-splitting with which the book opens. Klingoffer states at several points that the Jewish rejection of Jesus was the key event in Western history because, if Christianity had remained Jewish and had followed Jewish law, the faith would have been too difficult and demanding to have mass appeal.  This is an important point to make, but Klinghoffer nearly spoils it by burying it under a morass of speculations and counter-factuals.<br /><br />This book is well-meaning, well-informed and sincere.  As I have tried to explain, it is somewhat too brash and unfocused and requires close attention to follow the where the argument appears to lead.  The heart of the book is near the end rather than the beginning.  For those wishing to explore Jewish-Christian relationships in a less polemical manner, the reader may wish to consult the Institute of Christian and Jewish Studies, formed by a group of Christian and Jewish scholars to explore points of commonality -- the values of prayer, study, and faith among others -- between their two traditions.

US	48185764	R3LAEB8W4ZALZE	0520224345	463803618	Lorine Niedecker: Collected Works	Books	5	32	32	N	N	An Objectivist Poet from Wisconsin	I first learned of Lorine Niedecker (1903 -- 1970) from reading a selection of her poetry in Volume 2 of the Library of America's Anthology of American Poetry of the Twentieth Century. I was intrigued by the restrained, simple, and succinct character of the poems for two reasons.  First, they reminded me opf poetry I knew:  of the work of Charles Reznikoff, in particular, and of his fellow-objectivist poets, Louis Zukofsky, George Oppen, and W.C. Williams.  I later learned, of course, that Niedecker knew these writers, and was close to them.  She was particularly close to Louis Zukofsky, with whom she carried on a forty year correspondence and had a brief affair.<br /><br />I was also intrigued when I learned that Lorine Niedecker spent most of her life in the small town of Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, which is approximately mid-way between Milwaukee and Madison. She lived on a small island called Black Hawk Island outside the town where her family rented cabins and fished.  Much of her life was spent in poverty and for several years she was employed scrubbing floors in the local hospital.  Most of the poets with whom Niedecker was associated lived in New York City.  Although she visited New York City and spent time with Zukofsky, for the most part she learned and practiced her art by herself.<br /><br />I was familiar with Fort Atkinson because I lived for a short time in my early 20's in Jefferson, Wisconsin, an even smaller town just adjacent to Fort Atkinson. I was there briefly in the  early 1970's, just after Niedecker's death (She lived in Milwaukee at the time.) and I don't remember hearing anything about her. Today the town of Fort Atkinson and the local library where Niedecker worked for a time are active in preserving her memory.  I was moved to discover the work of this outstanding modernist poet who lived in obsurity in an area with which I was familiar.<br /><br />I was grateful to find this collected edition of Niedecker's works edited by Jenny Penberthy, Professor of English at Capilano College, Vancouver.  Ms. Penberthy has also edited a recently-published collection of letters between Niedecker and Zukofsky together with a book of critical essays: \\"Lorine Niedecker: Woman and Poet\\".  This collected edition of Niedecker's poetry is attractively put togther, includes good notes and a listing of Niedecker's published volumes, and begins with an informative introduction by Ms. Penberthy to Niedecker's life and work. The poems are arranged chronologically. The book includes Niedecker's early efforts and also includes some important prose and radio pieces, including the short work \\"Switchboard Girl\\" and a radio adaption of Faulkner's \\"As I lay dying.\\" Ms. Penberthy has done a great service in making Niedecker's work available.<br /><br />Much of Niedecker's early work was as a folk-poet.  In 1946, she published a collection of 80 short poems called \\"New Goose\\", which was based on the rhythms of the Mother Goose nursery rhymes.  These poems describe life in rural Wisconsin and show a strong sense of political activism  -- in common with Zukofsky.  They point to the injustices and hardships Niedecker found in war, the Depression, and a capitalist economy.  A subsequent collection of early poems was titled \\"For Paul\\", named after Zukofsky's young son, and featuring meditations on music, art, and the world of nature.<br /><br />Niedecker's later poetry becomes much more spare and formal.  She tended to write short poems, in five lines with irregular feet. She was influenced by Haiku and by Chinese poetry aw well as by her fellow-objectivists.  These poems are autobiographical, and include many scenes of life on Black Hawk Island.  The longest of these poems is titled \\"Paean to Place\\".  Later poems also describe the Lake Superior area around Sault Ste. Marie which Niedecker visited with her husband whom she married late in life.  She also grew increasingly interested in historical themes and wrote poetry about Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Adlai Stevenson, and Charles Darwin, among others.

US	48185764	R1B9Q514OFNPNG	0195108604	654479507	The Dhammapada	Books	5	47	48	N	N	A Scholarly Dhammapada	The Dhammapada is a deeply-inspiring religious text and the best-known work of the Theravada Buddhist canon.  It consists of 423 short verses arranged in 26 chapters which cover, in brief form, the major aspects of the Buddha's teachings from the most mundane to the deepest.  About 25 percent of the verses appear elsewhere in the Theravada Buddhist canon.  In many Buddhist countries, children memorize this text which has much to teach both the learned and the simple.  In its combination of simplicity and depth, the closest analogue to the Dhammapada in the Jewish-Christian Scriptures is the book of Psalms.<br /><br />The Dhammapada has been well-served by many excellent translations.  The translation under review here, by John Ross Carter, Professor of Philosophy at Colgate University, and Mahinda Palhawandana, Professer of Sanskrit Emeritus in Sri Lanka, is unique in its care and in the scope of its learning. In addition to the text, this translation includes line-by-line translations of the earliest Sri Lankan commentaries on the Dhammapada.  These commentaries were written over the course of many centuries and systematized in about 1000 A.D.  There is a separate and later series of commentaries on the text in which stories were written to illustrate the events that gave rise to the Buddha's utterance of each verse.  These stories are not included here, but they are summarized in another well-known translation of the Dhammapada by the monk Narada, which I shall mention below.<br /><br />This edition begins with a scholarly introduction to the text and the commentaries followed by an English rendition of the text of the Dhammapada without commentary.  The next section of the book repeats the English translation together with the Pali text with the addition of the extensive commentary.  Each chapter is arranged in accordance with the commentarial arrangement in which some verses are considered singly and others are combined in groups.  Following the translation of text and commentary, there is a series of notes.  Some of these notes deal with points of grammar while others describe in detail points of Buddhist teaching to illuminate the text and commentary.<br /><br />The goal of this detailed presentation is to make the Dhammapada and its ancient interpretations available so that the interested reader may study the text with his or her own eyes.  As Carter and Palihawanana state in their introduction (p. 9):<br /><br />\\"It was our endeavor to make this work as much as possible a 'stitching of the centuries'.  What this reveals is on the one hand the prodoundly evocative power of the religious sentiments expressed in the text, and on the other the conservatism of the tradition that interprets the text as we see in these documents. ... But from the way we set about it, what is of singular importance is the arrangement of this book: presenting the text itself as a text and presenting the history of its study in the setting of a growing tradition of interpretation....We wanted to make the text, as something in human hands, to point forward from the past through present into the future.\\"<br /><br />I want to give two brief examples from the translation.  First, verse 183 of the Dhammapada is universally regarded as offering the shortest, most basic statement of the Buddha's teaching.  Here it is in Carter and Palihawadana:<br /><br />\\"Refraining from all that is detrimental,<br /><br />The attainment of what is wholesome,<br /><br />The purification of one's mind:<br /><br />This is the instruction of Awakened Ones.\\"<br /><br />Note how the translation avoids the use of the word \\"bad\\" in line one and \\"good\\" in line two.  Many might question this. But the point of this translation is to avoid the theistic connotations many Western readers will bring to the words \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\".  Also note the term \\"Awakened Ones\\" in the final line rather than the more literal and traditional translation, \\"all the Buddhas\\". The difference points in the direction of universalizing the teaching rather than, perhaps, limiting it by sectarianism.<br /><br />I want to look briefly at verse 1 of the Dhammapada which is basic to much of what follows in the text.  It is also perhaps the most difficult verse in the work.  Here it is in Carter and Palihawadana:<br /><br />\\"Preceded by perception are mental states,<br /><br />For them is perception supreme,<br /><br />From perception have they sprung.<br /><br />If, with perception polluted, one speaks or acts,<br /><br />Thence suffering follows<br /><br />As a wheel the draught ox's foot.\\"<br /><br />Most translation of verse 1 speak in terms of \\"the mind.\\"  Thus, Narada translates the beginning of the verse: \\"Mind is the forerunner of (all evil) states.  Mind is chief: mind-made are they.\\" ... Carter and Palihawadana try to present the text in a way that will not encourage the Western reader to equate it with the idealism of Plato or Berkeley.  The verse remains a difficult and deep teaching on any reading.<br /><br />I have the good fortune to participate in a Sutta Study Group where we read the Dhammapada chapter-by-chapter over the course of about one year.  We used Carter and Palihawadana together with several other translations, as we discussed and debated and tried to understand the Dhammapada together.<br /><br />The reader may not by lucky enough to have access to such a group, but the Dhammapada is a work that will reward individual study at any level.  Some readers may find Carter and Palihawandana more than they need to begin.  But for those wanting to make a detailed study of this great text, this work is invaluable.the direction of universalizing the teaching rather than, perhaps, limiting it by sectarianism. <br /> <br />I want to look briefly at verse 1 of the Dhammapada which is basic to much of what follows in the text.

It is a truly worthwhile project. The series covers the United States in all its diversity, and many of the finest volumes in the series deal with the African-American experience and with the Civil Rights movement in all their facets and complexities.  The LOA's single-volume edition, published in 2004, of the works of James Weldon Johnson (1871 -- 1938) is an outstanding addition to the series and an essential work for understanding the rise of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States.  More broadly, Johnson's writings are  universal and will be of value for any reader interested in American literature.<br /><br />Johnson had a varied career as a poet, novelist, essayist, editorial writer, diplomat, lawyer, educator, civil rights activist, and songwriter.  His achievements in these fields are well-documented in this book.  The LOA's anthology includes Johnson's famous novel of \\"passing\\", \\"The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man\\" (1912); Johnson's own autobiography, \\"Along this Way\\" (1933), a generous selection of poetry, including \\"God's Trombones\\" (1928), together with selections from Johnson's history of African-Americans in  New York City, \\"Black Manhattan\\" and selections from Johnson's essays and editorials.<br /><br />The reader coming to Johnson for the first time might well begin with the poetry.  Poetry and music seem to me Johnson's greatest loves and the source of his best accomplishments.  Johnson's \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\" written in 1900 is probably his best-known individual work and is commonly referred to as the \\"Negro National Anthem\\".  Johnson's poem \\"Fifty Years: 1863 -1913\\" commemorates President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and is a moving commentary on the work that remains to be done to implement the vision of that document.  \\"God's Trombones\\" is Johnson's tribute to the African-American preacher with seven sermons in verse.  There are many other poems in this volume for the reader to explore, many with African -American themes and many without them.<br /><br />After reading the poetry, I suggest proceeding to Johnson's only novel, \\"The Autobiography of an ex-colored Man\\" published anonomously in 1912.  Ths short novel is an exellent picture of race relations as they were at the time.  But the book's themes are universal in character as Johnson depicts his troubled protagonist, buffeted by chance events, and lacking the degree of self-knowledge to find himself.<br /><br />Johnson's essays and newspaper editorials give an idea of the breadth of his interests.  Johnson fought passionately against the practice of lynching, as documented in many places including his essay \\"Lynching: A National Disgrace\\".  Johnson compiled ground-breaking anthologies of Negro Spirituals and African-American poetry, and the introductions to the anthologies are included here.  Johnson's \\"Black Manhattan\\" is offered only in excerpts but the selections here show black contributions to the Broadway stage in which Johnson himself and his brother, Rosamund, played leading roles.  The selection also includes an excellent portrayal of the blues singer, Clara Smith, who today has, unfortunately, faded into obscurity. ( She is not to be confused with the more famous singer, Bessie Smith).<br /><br />I would turn last in this volume to Johnson's autobiography, \\"Along this Way.\\"  This is a detailed work in which Johnson describes for the reader his childhood, his education, and his many and varied careers and writings.  It is a great autobiography in its own right, and the reader will best appreciate it with an initial familiarity with Johnson's other writings.  There are unforgettable moments in the book, and scenes of Johnson's relationships with other influential African-American leaders, including DuBois,Paul Lawrence Dunbar, and Booker T. Washington.<br /><br />These books are full of reflections and insights on philosophical and literary subjects, together with Johnson's thoughts and efforts regarding race relations in the United States.  Johnson emphasized the great achievements of African-Americans in creating the spirituals, in poetry, and in music -- particularly ragtime.  He wanted African-Americans to be proud of their heritage and accomplishments, and he wanted his non-African-American readers to become aware of and to appreciate these accomplishments. Johnson was a writer of great gifts and broad themes. The Library of American has done a great service by making accessible this collection of his works.g DuBois, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, and Booker T.

The Civil War era photos are, of course in black-and white. The modern photographs are in color and were taken especially for this book.<br /><br />The book is presented chronologically beginning with Fort Sumter, South Carolina and proceeding through Appomattox Court House, Ford's Theatre and the dedication of the first Civil War Battlefield Monuments at First Manassas on June 10, 1865.  The photos cover the major campaigns of the Civil War on land and sea including Fort Sumter, McClellan's Peninsula Campaign, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Stone's River, Vicksburg, Chickamauga, Lookout Mountain, the Atlanta Campaign, Grant's Overland Campaign, Petersburg, Nashville, and Appomattox.  There are no photographs of Shiloh and none of Andersonville.  The book is accompanied by a short running textual commentary which summarizes the events leading to the historical photographs.<br /><br />Many of the historic photographs, such as those of Antietam and Gettysburg, will be familiar to students of the Civil War.  But it is valuable to have a short collection of photographs from the entire War in a single attractive volume and to be able to compare them to current pictures of the sites.<br /><br />I found this book an excellent way of stimulating reflection about the Civil War.  The contrasting photographs show eloquently how our Civil War Battlefields have been transformed from places of violence to Hallowed Ground which offer the opportunity for peace, meditation, and contemplation.  The book encouraged me to think again about the purpose of the war, the importance of a united country, and the vision which still needs to be realized fully of a Nation which offers freedom, liberty, and equality to all regardless of race.<br /><br />This book doesn't take long to read but it can be revisited with pleasure many times.  It is a good book for browsing and would make an excellent gift for those loved ones on your gift list with an interest in the Civil War.s book doesn't take long to read but it can be revisited with pleasure many times.

US	48185764	R2ENUV12KOCYR9	048628512X	669543245	The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (Dover Thrift Editions)	Books	5	22	25	N	N	Johnson's Classic Novel of "Passing"	Many novels of the African-American experience in the United States use the theme of \\"passing\\". These novels generally involve a light-complexioned African-American who can \\"pass\\" for white.  Among other things, novels based on a theme of \\"passing\\" allow the character and the author to comment upon black-white relationships in the United States from both sides -- from the black experience and from the white experience.<br /><br />Both white and black authors have made extensive use of the theme of \\"passing\\".  The earliest novel involving \\"passing\\" of which I am aware is by William Dean Howells in his short 1891 book, \\"An Imperative Duty\\" which dealt with an inter-racial marriage.  The African-American novelist Nella Larsen wrote a novel titled \\"Passing\\" set in the Harlem Renaissance.  More recently, Philip Roth's novel \\"The Human Stain\\" involves the story of Professor Coleman Silk, a distinguished academic and student of the classics who passes for many years as white.<br /><br />Coleman Silk is the successor to the protagonist of James Weldon Johnson's only novel, \\"The Autobiography of an ex-colored Man\\" written in 1912.  The unnamed protagonist of the book is an individual, like Roth's character Coleman Silk, with great intellectual and artistic gifts who is torn between the opportunities open to him as an, apparently, white person and his strong sense of black identity.  Like Coleman Silk and the characters in most novels involving the theme of \\"passing\\", Johnson's protagonist marries a white woman and lives a life plagued with guilt regarding his abandonment of his heritage as an African-American. Johnson's short novel is, to my mind, the best written on the theme of \\"passing\\", and it is a fine novel indeed. The book initially was published anonymously.  The writing is so powerful and believable that many readers took the book for a true autobiography until Johnson acknowledged his authorship in 1914.  Many years later, Johnson wrote his own autobiography, titled \\"Along This Way\\" in part to show that the story of his own life was not the story of the protagonist in the \\"Autobiography\\".<br /><br />Johnson's story shows how his protagonist goes back and forth, both internally and in the outward events of life, about whether to make his way in the white or in the black world.  He ultimately finds himself successful but unhappy. In addition to the story line of the book, Johnson uses the \\"passing\\" theme to allow many reflective passages by characters in the book on racial relationships in the United States early in the 20th Century.  The most famous such scene occurs as the protagonist travels in a \\"smoking car\\" for whites on a train in the segregated South.  He participates in a discussion among several white men of varied backgrounds on the \\"race question\\" as it was viewed at the time.  There is also a chilling scene in the book involving a lynching, the burning alive of a black person.  Johnson worked fervently in the latter years of his life to secure the passage of anti-lynching legislation in Congress.<br /><br />But Johnson's novel includes a great deal more than a consideration of race issues.  The book offers an outstanding picture of life in early twentieth Century America -- in the South and in Johnson's beloved New York City.  The book is filled with pictures of dives and gambling dens and of the trade of cigar making in both South and North.  It is filled with the love of the piano and of classical music.  Most strikingly, the book has the spirit and feel of ragtime, which reached the height of its popularity during the years in which the book appeared.  Johnson shows great appreciation for this product of American culture.<br /><br />The book also illustrates some universal themes.  The protagonist is troubled, specifically, by the conflict between his identity as an African-American and his wish to succeed as a white person.  But the broader themes of the book are the consequences of lack of self-knowledge, therole of chance in human life, and the consequences of a certain sense of purposelessness and frustration, which plague many individuals separately from any consideration of race.  Johnson develops these themes eloquently and ties them in well with his theme of \\"passing\\".<br /><br />Johnson's novel is an important work of American fiction which deserves to be read.edge, the role of chance in human life, and the consequences of a certain sense of purposelessness and frustration, which plague many individuals separately from any consideration of race.

US	48185764	R112W1L8ZEBESN	0060929871	949556910	Brave New World	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Overcoming Huxley's "Brave New World"	This famous novel appeared in 1931, in the uneasy period between the two World Wars, and has become a Twentieth Century Classic.  The story is a fable set far in the future of the dangers of materialism, an uncritical faith in science, and totalitarianism. At its most basic level, \\"Brave New World\\" is a satire on the possible course of communism (note the names of some of the main characters: Lenina and Marx) and a defense of classical liberalism.  In the early 1930's, in the midst of world-wide Depression, communism had considerable appeal to many writers.<br /><br />The people in Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" are raised in test-tubes rather than \\"vivaparously\\" and sorted  before birth into various classes of differing capabilities.  An overriding feature of the society is sexual promiscuity and the absense of love and close emotional relationships.  Feelings of depression, anxiety, or loneliness are handled by a drug, soma. Classical works from mankind's \\"primitive age\\" including Shakespeare and the Bible are banned.  In their quiet but firm way, the leaders of the sociey enforce conformity and consumption.  The society's heroes are Ford -- whose name is used in many oaths -- and Marx.<br /><br />Huxley describes his society with a great deal of detail which makes his dystopia (a term for a negative utopia) seem convincing.  The writing is sharply-drawn and satirical with passages of real eloquence near the end of the book when Huxley discusses his vision, at that time of his career, of human possiblilty and freedom. The plot of the book centers upon a character called the Savage who is brought to England from a primitive Indian reservation in New Mexico where, somehow, he has read Shakespeare and practiced a combination of ancient Indian ritual and Christianity.  He falls in love with a woman named Lenina.  One of Lenina's sexual companions is Bernard Marx, who has developed doubts about the totalitarian society in which he finds himself and ultimately is banished.<br /><br />This novel is subject to a multitude of interpretations. Huxley's dystopia differs greatly from the forms of totalitarianism that have plagued the world in the Twentieth Century.  In some respects, Huxley's dystopia seems mild compared to them.  Furthermore, I don't think it useful to take Huxley as a critique or as a description of, say, current society in the United States or in England. There are many differences between our world and Huxley's dystopia, and it is not clear to me that we are headed in the direction \\"Brave New World\\" feared.<br /><br />I think \\"Brave New World\\" shows that even with a smiling face and taken at its best, a totalitarian society is a horrible affair in its denial of individuality, love, and spirituality. The dystopia is a paradigm to be avoided more than a prophecy of the way some cultures may be headed or a description and condemnation of a current state of things.<br /><br />I found Huxley's forward to \\"Brave New World\\" written twenty years after the book highly enlightening and a perceptive review of the famous work he wrote as a young man.  Huxley critiques his novel for presenting an \\"either-or\\" situation which did not fully consider options either to the Savage's reservation life, with its attachment to superstition, or to the \\"Brave New World.\\"  In particular, Huxley argues in his forward that a life or religious reflection and contemplation is the best way to avoid the horns of the dilema set forth in his novel. Huxley came to believe in natural (non-revealed) religion and in the possiblity of approaching the transcendent through individual experience.  Thus, in his forward, Huxley writes with respect to going around the horns of the dilemma of \\"Brave New World\\": \\"Religion would be the conscious and intelligent pursuit of man's Final End, the unitive knowledge of the immanent Tao or Logos, the transcendent Godhead or Brahman.\\"  Huxley also supported economic decentalization and was highly critical of the passions ofnationalism.<br /><br />I found it revealing to consider how Huxley's thinking developed over the years from \\"Brave New World\\" as suggested in his forward. Huxley went on to explore human consciousness through the use of the drug mescaline -- ironically given his treatment of the drug,soma, in \\"Bave New World\\" and wrote about it in his book \\"The Doors of Perception.\\"  But I think Huxley's ultimate thoughts were expressed in his anthology \\"The Perennial Philosophy\\" -- a collection of mystical writings from many traditions.  Huxley saw in the path of contemplation a way open to all people regardless of creed to experience the divine and to come to an understanding of themselves.

Benedict (Baruch) Spinoza (1632 - 1677) was one of the most seminal philosophers in history.  His work constitutes a crucial component of Enlightenment thought and of modern secularism.  In 1656, at the age of 23, Spinoza was excommunicated from the Portuguese synagogue in Amsterdam in which he had grown up.  Excommunication was not an uncommon occurence at that time and place, but the excommunicating document banning Spinoza is extremely and unusually harsh. There have been many theories over the years about why Spinoza was excommunicated and excommunicated with such uncompromising sternness.<br /><br />Steven Nadler,is Professor of Philosophy and the Director of the Mosse/Weinstein Center for Jewish Studies at the University of Wisconsin and the author of the biography, \\"Spinoza\\" (1999).  In \\"Spinoza's Heresy: Immortality and the Jewish Mind\\" Professor Nadler offers his understanding of the reasons underlying Spinoza's excommunication.  But this book is not simply a historical account of the events leading up to Spinoza's excommunication in 1656.  Professor Nadler gives the reader as well a study of Spinoza's philosophy and of some of the key concepts on which it rests.<br /><br />Professor Nadler begins with a discussion of the Portugese Jewish community in Amsterdam and of the role excommunication (cherem) played in that community.  He examines in detail the particular ban issued against Spinoza. (Much of this material can also be found in Professor Nadler's biography of Spinoza.)<br /><br />Professor Nadler finds that Spinoza's excommunication is an overdetermined event -- which he analogizes to the American Civil War -- in that many reasons can be found for it and the difficulty lies in trying to isolate a specific factor. Professor Nadler finds ample grounds for the cherem in Spinoza's denial of an anthropomorphic God, in his denial that the Torah was divinely revealed, and in his denial of the chosen status of the Jewish people. But, he argues, the decisive factor in the harshness of the cherem proclaimed against Spinoza was likely due to Spinoza's denial of personal immortality.<br /><br />Professor Nadler offers a learned discussion of the various theories about personal immortality in the Jewish tradition and in the works of two medieval rationalistic Jewish philosophers who, he argues, deeply influenced Spinoza: Maimonides and Gershonides.  Professor Nadler argues no particular type of belief in personal immortality is required under Jewish law and that Spinoza's own treatment of personal immortality in the Ethics follows closely and expands upon the attenuated, to say the least, commitment to personal immortality in the writings of Gershonides.<br /><br />Professor Nadler follows his discussion of Jewish texts and philosophy with a discussion of Spinoza's views on personal immortality.  These views are obscure and not free from differences in interpretation among philosophers. Spinoza's treatment of immortality in Part V of the Ethics is notoriously difficult.  Professor Nadler draws a distinction between eternity and immortality.  He concludes that while Spinoza describes truths as eternal, his philosophy has no place for an immortal soul that survives the death of the body. He concludes further that the denial of the immortality of the soul is crucial to the direction and goal of Spinoza's philosophy, and that Spinoza had been denying the soul's immortality well before completing the Ethics -- specifically at the time prior to his cherem in 1656.<br /><br />The questions persists about why this issue, above all others, was critical to the Portugese Jewish community that excommunicated Spinoza.  Professor Nadler gives a detailed response that shows that the question of personal immortality had arisen many times within the Jewish community in the years prior to Spinoza's excommunication. He gives a fascinating and deeply learned account of the writings of the rabbis and of heretics such as Uriel da Costa on the question.  The leaders of the Jewish community, whatever other doctrinal differences they may have had, would accept no disagreement from the doctrine of the immortality of the soul.  Some of their firmness on this issue may have been due to the precarious nature of the religious freedom accorded to them in Calvinist Holland and to the perceived need to have the community adhere to consevative and established religous beliefs.<br /><br />This is a fascinating and difficult book, both as a history and as a work of philosophical interpretation.  Professor Nadler draws deeply on historical sources and on Spinoza's own writings.  He also draws heavily upon Harry Wolfson's two volume study of Spinoza's philosophy (1934), while criticizing it in many places, and upon Professor Yirimahu Yovel's more recent work, \\"Spinoza and Other Heretics\\" (1989).  Both Spinoza and the Jewish community are treated with respect and understanding, but Nadler's heart and mind, I think, belong more to Spinoza.<br /><br />Professor Nadler has given the reader a provocative treatment of ideas that remain deeply important and that still have the power to move the mind.  I wish I had this book, and the wisdom to use it, many years ago, when I was doing my own graduate study of Spinoza.ta on the question.

Both Spinoza and the Jewish community are treated with respect and understanding, but Nadler's heart and mind, I think, belong more to Spinoza. <br /> <br />Professor Nadler has given the reader a provocative treatment of ideas that remain deeply important and that still have the power to move the mind.  I wish I had this book, and the wisdom to use it, many years ago, when I was doing my own graduate study of Spinoza.	2005-03-29
US	48185764	RXVIKOYXETAAB	030680929X	669543245	Along This Way: The Autobiography Of James Weldon Johnson	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Johnson's  "Along this Way"	James Weldon Johnson (1871 -1938) was the closest American approximation possible to a Renaissance man. He is best-known for writing the lyrics to \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\",  considered the \\"African-American National Anthem.\\" He was a poet, the author of \\"God's Trombones\\" among much else (including the poem \\"Fifty Years\\" still one of the best meditations on Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation) and of the famous novel \\"The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man\\" (1912).  But Johnson was much more. He served several tumultuous years in diplomatic service as American counsul to Venezuela and Nicaragua.  With his brother, Rosamund, and Bob Cole, he formed part of a famed and highly-successful black songwriting and Vaudeville team in the early years of the Twentieth Century.  Johnson founded the first African-American high school in his home town of Jacksonville, Florida and, almost in passing, he became the first African-American admitted to the Florida bar without attending Law School (by reading law and passing a treacherous oral examination.) Johnson was a newspaper editor and a founder of the NAACP where he took an active role in litigating against laws restricting the voting rights of African-Americans, and, in particular, worked tirelessly in support of Federal anti-lynching legislation.  In the final decade of his life, Johnson taught creative writing and American literature at several universities and lived, for a time, the life of contemplation and reflection that he said had been his lifelong goal.<br /><br />Johnson lived an inspiring life. And in his autobiography, \\"Along this Way\\" (1933) he allows the reader to share in much of it.  The autobiography is a lengthy and detailed work in which Johnson not only tells the story of his life, but he also describes a good deal of African-American history in the South, where he grew up, and in the rest of the United States during the pivotal half-century following reconstruction.  We can see in Johnson's story, for example, how segregation and Jim Crow gradually but forcefully came to pervade the Southern States in the late 19th and early 20th century.  Johnson also gives vibrant descriptions of life in New York City, of the growth of Harlem, and of African-American singers, actors and entertainers on Broadway -- in which he himself played a prominent role.  There are chilling descriptions of lynching and of Johnson's efforts to bring this barbaric practice to an end. One of the more memorable scenes of Johnson's personal life in the book is a description of how he himself was almost lynched when he was observed talking alone to a light-skinned woman in a public park in Jacksonville. (His would-be attackers thought the woman was white.)<br /><br />The book is divided into four main sections, with the first describing Johnson's childhood and education at Atlanta University.  Part two presents a picture of New York City and Johnson's efforts as a songwriter.  Part three focuses on Johnsons counsular work in Latin America while Part four discusses Johnson's work with the NAACP.  But these are only the broadest, bare-bones descriptions of an extraordinary life.  Johnson combines his discussion of his public life with insightful comments on most of his writings, including his poetry, novel, his history \\"Black Manhattan\\" and his work as an anthologizer of African-American poetry and of Spirituals.<br /><br />There are moments in the book when I wanted to know more of Johnson's inner life.  He tells us, for example, of his courtship of and marriage to Grace Nail but, with the exception of some discussion of her reactions to Johnson's diplomatic posts, we see little of her in the book.  Johnson is reticent, in common with most writers of autobiography, in letting us see too deeply beyond the public figure.  But at the end of the book, he offers the reader some broad reflections, centering upon his agnosticism and of his hopes and ambitions for humanity.<br /><br />Johnson's life focusedupon his efforts to secure the rights of black people in the United States, but his life, work, and writings were universal in theme. In \\"Along this Way\\" he gives us the story of a life both active and reflective.

The poems are heavily autobiographical in tone, meditative, and reflective.  They deal with Milosz' struggle for religious, and in particular Catholic, faith in a world of secularism, mechanism, and suffering.  They also describe the conflict in Milosz' own life between the call to the religious life and the lure of the world, with its natural beauty, and human sexuality.  Milosz tries to reconcile the tensions among these two polarities.<br /><br />The book is dense and richly detailed with allusions to Polish poets, to Milosz' relatives, particularly to his cousin Oscar Milosz (1877-1939) a French poet and diplomat, and to the mystical thinkers Jacob Boehme and Emmanuel Swedenborg, who have deeply influenced Milosz and his approach to religious questions.<br /><br />The book is divided into five parts.  The first part consists of a series of short poems discussing the poet's struggle for religious meaning.  In many of these poems, Milosz revisits and reflects upon his life. The title of the book \\"Second Space\\" derives from the first poem of the collection in which Milosz laments the difficulty of conceiving of a \\"second space\\" in our modern world -- the space of both heaven and hell. Milosz writes in a clear style with many striking figures and phrases.  Thus, he concludes his poem, \\"The Old Women\\" with the benediction: \\"May the day of your death not be a day of hopelessness,/ but of trust in the light that shines through earthly forms.\\"<br /><br />The second part of the book is a series of eleven interior monologues by \\"Father Severinus,\\" who describes himself in the first poem as \\"a priest without faith\\".  In these poems, Father Severnus meditates on the importance, mystery, and difficulty of a spiritual life as he describes his own internal struggles and the struggles of some of the people who come to him for help.<br /><br />The third part of the book is in Milosz' own voice and consists of 23 poems forming a \\"Treatise on Theology.\\" These poems are in the voice of the layperson -- the poet himself -- rather than of Father Severnus, but the themes and preoccupations are the same.  They are epitomized in the final poem of this group, \\"Beautiful Lady\\" in which Milosz describes his responses to the appearances of the Virgin Mary at Lourdes and Fatima.<br /><br />The fourth part of the book, \\"Apprentice\\", is the poet's tribute to the work of his cousin, the French poet Oscar Milosz.  This poem is richly personal and allusive, and Milosz accompanies it with extensive notes. I found it helpful to read the poem first with the notes followed by a reading straight through without the notes -- which tend to interfere with the text.<br /><br />The book concludes with what to may mind is its best section, a brief retelling of the \\"Orpheus and Euridice\\" legend in modern garb with Milosz himself as the protagonist.  Orpheus in this retelling struggles with the loss of religous conviction as much as with the loss of his beloved. There is an eloquent pasage in this poem in which Milosz describes the goal of his poetic endeavor:<br /><br />\\"He sang the brightness of morning and green rivers,<br />He sang of smoking water in the rose-colored daybreaks,<br />Of colors: cinnabar, carmine, burnt sienna, blue,<br />Of the delight of swimming in the sea under marble cliffs,<br />Of feasting on a terrace above the tumult of a fishing port,<br />Of the tasts of wine, olive oil, almonds, mustard, salt.<br />Of the flight of the swallow, the falcon,<br />Of a dignified flock of pelicans above a bay,<br />Of the scene of an armful of lilacs in summer rain,<br />Of his having composed his words always against death<br />And of having made no rhyme in praise of nothingness.\\"<br /><br />\\"Second Space\\" is a moving valedictory volume by a great Twentieth Century poet.is in Milosz' own voice and consists of 23 poems forming a \\"Treatise on Theology.\\" These poems are in the voice of the layperson -- the poet himself -- rather than of Father Severnus, but the themes and preoccupations are the same.

Johnson had extraordinary gifts as a poet. His celebration of the African-American preacher in God's Trombones, published in 1927, is a masterpiece of American poetry.<br /><br />Johnson was inspired to write \\"God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse \\" after hearing a stirring African-American preacher in Kansas City in 1918.  Johnson wrote seven free-verse poems on biblical themes to capture the rhythm, content, language and religious commitment of the African-American preacher. Johnson also wrote a celebrated prose introduction to the book in which he described the place of the preacher in African-American life and explained his decision not to use dialect in writing the poems. Johnson also explained why he used the trombone as the guiding figure of his poem.  Johnson wrote of his experience with the Kansas City preacher:<br /><br />\\"He strode the pulpit up and down in what was actually a very rhythmic voice, a voice -- what shall I say? -- not of an organ or a trumpet, but rather of a trombone, the instrument possessing above all others the power to express the wide and varied range of emotions encompassed by the human voice -- and with greater amplitude.  He intoned, he moaned, he pleaded, -- he blared, he crashed, he thundered.  ... [T]he emotional effect upon me was irresistable.\\"<br /><br />The poetry opens with a short preliminary call to prayer, \\"Listen, Lord\\" followed by the seven sermons. The sermons open with the preacher's account of \\"The Creation\\"; and they conclude with a sermon on the end of days, \\"The Judgment Day\\". Four of the remaining poems deal with Biblical subjects, \\"The Prodigal Son\\", \\"Noah Built the Ark\\", \\"The Crucifixion\\", and \\"Let my People Go\\", the story of the Exodus from Egypt.  The remaining sermon \\"Go down death -- a Funeral Sermon\\" is a meditation on the death of an elderly woman in Georgia who, in the preacher's language, is carried by Death to the throne of Jesus.  The poems are in free verse, move in an elevated and lively style, include vivid imagery, and a sense of rhythmic speech and propulsion.  It is useful to read them aloud.  The poems make use effective use of repetition.  Look at \\"The Crucifixion\\", for example, and see the many different adjectives Johnson applies to the figure of Jesus.  The opening lines of the first three stanzas alone refer to \\"my gentle Jesus\\", \\"my burdened Jesus\\" and \\"my sorrowing Jesus\\".  Each of the poems conclude with a short and effective exhortation to the listener.  Thus, in the final words of the final poem, \\"The Judgment Day\\":<br /><br />\\"Sinner, oh sinner,<br /><br />Where will you stand,<br /><br />In that great day when God's a-going to rain down fire?\\"<br /><br />These poems are short and the book can be read quickly.  But they will have a long-lived impact on the reader.  This book would make an excellent introduction to poetry for young people.

But Maurice Hinson's new work, \\"A Pianist's Dictionary\\" (2004) is a rare exception to the rule. Hinson is Senior Professor Emeritus of Piano at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and has written a number of highly-regarded reference works for piano, particularly his \\"Guide to the Pianist's Repertoire\\".  The \\"Pianist's Dictionary\\" is not only a reference work, but it is also a joy to read.  It was a pleasure to work through this volume, to learn new things about music and the piano and to be reminded of things I already knew.  I have been an amateur pianist since adolescence and throughout my adult life, and this book struck many chords.<br /><br />There will be something for every pianist, teacher, and music-lover in this book.  The entries cover composers, works of music, performers and teachers, literature about the piano, performance and interpretive markings, and much else.  It is a fine reference but it is more.  It will stir memory and thought.<br /><br />Here are some examples of what I found in the book.  In 1974, Reginald Gerig published an outstanding study, \\"Famous Pianists and Their Technique\\" discussing the history of theories of playing the instrument.  I was familiar with the book when it came out but haven't thought much about it since. There are entries in Hinson's dictionary for the book itself (p.52) and for Gerig (p.64)  Reading the entries brought back memories and made me want to pursue Gerig's book again.<br /><br />To take another example, I grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and have a soft spot in my heart for the pianist Ralph Votapek, who when I was a teenager inspired the city by winning the Naumberg Award and the first Van Cliburn competition.  I met Votapek briefly last year when he played a recital of Debussy at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.  There is an excellent entry in Hinson's book on Ralph Votapek (p. 206) which brought back my pleasure at remembering him win his competitions, meeting him years later, and hearing him play.<br /><br />I recently read a book which described a passage in Brahms's second string quintet as a \\"roulade\\".  I was embarassed not to know the term. But it appears in Hinson's book (\\"A brilliant run; ornamental florid passage\\") and I was able to hear the piece, pick out the roulade, and increase my knowledge and enjoyment of the music.<br /><br />A composer that fascinates me in Leo Ornstein (1892-2002), an immigrant to the United States who abandoned a virtuoso peforming career to devote himself to avant-garde composition and teaching.  (A selection of his piano music appears on the Naxos American Music series.) I was happy to find a detailed entry on Ornstein in Hinson's book (p. 126).<br /><br />Every lover of music or the piano will be able to read this book and find his or her own similar examples.  This book is a great reference and a great way to remember or find music that moves the heart and memory.  Many readers will enjoy thinking about the entries in the book and, perhaps, also about the entries that might have been in it.  I found one small error worthy of note.  In the course of a discussion of Charles Ives, (p.85) Hinson states that pianist Ralph Kirkpatrick was a \\"tireless advocate\\" to bring Ives's piano music to public attention.  Ralph Kirkpatrick was a harpsichordist best known for his work on Scarlatti.  John Kirkpatrick was Ives's champion.  Both Ralph and John Kirkpatrick have their own entries in Hinson's book (p. 92) where the matter is set aright.<br /><br />Any lover of the piano will enjoy Hinson's dictionary.at remembering him win his competitions, meeting him years later, and hearing him play. <br /> <br />I recently read a book which described a passage in Brahms's second string quintet as a \\"roulade\\".

Swafford has written an outstanding biography of Brahms and a through, perceptive consideration of his music.  But greater than either of these accomplishments, his book brings Brahms and late ninetheenth century Vienna to life. Swafford has given a great deal of thought to Brahms, and his book helped me think about the nature of creative gifts, about the relationship between love and calling, and about many matters that are much broader than either biography or music.<br /><br />Swafford gives a great deal of attention to two formative experiences of young Brahms: 1. his childhood of poverty in Hamburg where he played as a pre-adolescent in dives frequented by prostitutes and sailors (this account has been questioned by some writers) and 2. Robert Schumann's article about Brahms at the age of 20, heralding the young man as the heir to Beethoven and predicting a brilliant future for him.<br /><br />Swafford's book emphasizes Brahms's difficulties throghout life in forming a lasting, sexual relationship with a woman other than prostitutes. Brahms exhibited to sort of behavior towards women frequently described in terms of \\"The Virgin and the Whore.\\" Brahms could only be physically intimate with women he did not respect.  Thus, Brahms ultimately rejected the romantic opportunities that came his way in the persons of Clara Schumann and Agathe von Siebold, among other women.  He withdrew into a protective shell when friendships with women threatened to become romantic.  Yet women were the greatest source of inspiration to Brahms as a composer.  He poured into his music what he denied himself as a man.  A crusty figure, Brahms was difficult to know intimately, particularly by women.<br /><br />The article by Robert Schumann made Brahms famous from the age of twenty before he had done much.  Great things were expected of Brahms, but Schumann's praise burdened the fledgling composer with the fear that he would disappoint Schumann's hopes in him.  Brahms worked slowly and became an astonishing musical craftsman; but he felt he had to justify Schumann's confidence as well as meet the standards of the great composers of the past, especially Beethoven.<br /><br />There is a wealth of discussion in this book of Brahms' relationships with both Clara and Robert Schumann, their daughter Julie, the violinist Joachim, the critic Hanslick, Liszt, Wagner, Bruckner, Mahler, and many others.  The book is set in the last years of liberal Vienna, and Swafford poignantly draws the relationship between Brahms's music and the rise of irrationality, anti-semitism, and violence that would soon plague the Twentieth Century.<br /><br />I found Swafford's discussions of Brahms music highly insightful.  It is less detailed, perhaps, than Malcolm MacMacDonald's study which discusses virtually every work of Brahms; but there is ample material here to form a basis for an exploration and appreciation of Brahms's music.  Brahms' romanticism and his musical formalism and learning are well-explored and tied in with a consideration of his major works.  Swafford's most thorough musical discussions are of the four symphonies, and he tends to move quicker over Brahms's songs. (This was also the case in Swafford's book on Ives.)<br /><br />I felt I got to know Brahms, in spite of himself, in this book. Brahms devoted himself wholeheartedly to his art, and in the process lost a great deal of the value of human love and human sexual closeness.  It was and remains a difficult exchange.  More than encouraging the reader to get to know and love Brahms's music, Swafford's biography will help the reader think about and try to compassionately understand people.e age of twenty before he had done much.

As is sometimes the case with novels of ideas, the book is static with little in the way of action, drama, or character development.  It is meditative with an overabundance of factual minutae in places with the result that neither the story nor the ideas come through well.<br /><br />There are, nevertheless, a few good scenes in the book, good use of irony and ambiguity, and some provocative ideas. Thus, at the conclusion of a chapter, presenting Palomar's reflections from his terrace, he observes that \\"[i]t is only after you have come to know the surface of things, that you can venture to seek what is underneath....  But the surface of things is inexhaustible.\\"(p.55)  This is stuff for thought. But it is buried here in too much tedium.<br /><br />There is little in the way of plot in this book. Instead the book consists of a number of short vignettes, elaborately organized under an index at the conclusion. The vignettes involve the meditations of Mr. Palomar, named after the famous telescope, who is an observer of nature, people, and his mind.  He is quiet and reserved and keeps aloof from the hurly-burly of the everyday.  The episodes take place in various locations, the beach, Palomar's home, Paris, Japan, and elsewhere, and it may be that he is to be taken as a symbol rather than as a real character.<br /><br />The story is told with irony and I think the reader is meant to contrast the virtues of thought, restraint, self-sufficiency, and reserve in Mr Palomar with his alienation from the larger culture and with his aloneness and eccentricities. The stories follow a pattern in which Mr. Palomar's thoughts and experiences go radically off course as he is confronted with the reality of a world independent of his wishes.<br /><br />As most reviewers have noted, the most memorable portion of this book is a chapter titled \\"The Naked Bosom\\" in which Mr. Palomar thinks about and responds to a topless sunbather on the beach.  There is good irony here, a wry discussion of the relationship between the sexes, and a good illustration of how human sexuality stands outside of the order of nature, somehow, even to the most detached observer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the remainder of the book is much more slowly paced, loses itself in a welter of detail, and, for me, quickly becomes dull.  I found that there just isn't enough to fasten upon here to make this book work successfully either as philosophy or novel.alomar thinks about and responds to a topless sunbather on the beach.

My collection includes the song texts in German, but, alas, does not have English translations.  I needed to know something of the texts and thus turned to \\"The Fischer-Dieskau Book of Lieder\\", first published in 1976 and recently reissued.  This book includes the original texts and English translations of 750 songs, including, of course, many texts set by Brahms.  The book does not include all the songs in my compiliation, but it gave me much more than I had without it.  It includes, among much else, the complete text and translation of Brahms's song-cycle, \\"Die Schone Magelone\\" Op. 33, which set 15 poems of Ludwig Tieck.  In this day of cost-cutting, where both texts and translations are frequently not included in CDs, Fischer-Dieskau's book is an excellent resource.<br /><br />The song texts are easy to use as they are accompanied by a three-fold index that lists the contents by composer, poets, and titles and first lines. The songs in the book are arranged alphabetically. The book also includes an excellent introduction by Fischer-Dieskau which manages to be both an overview and highly personal at the same time.<br /><br />In addition to helping to find texts and translations of songs on recordings, this book has many other uses.  It can be used simply to read the poetry that was set by the great composers of song and to follow-up by listening to settings of poems that the reader finds appealing.  The book can be used as a guide to songs that were set by more than one composer or to explore songs. The book includes many texts that were set by the great masters of song, including Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Wolf, and others. There are many other texts set by composers who are obscure.  For those with a desire to do so, this book can be used as a means of finding and exploring songs by composers who lie somewhat outside the most familiar track.

Much of this growth is due to the increased availability of the Buddha's teaching, and to the spread of meditation practice.  There is a wealth of books available on Buddhist teachings, including many translations of Buddhist Suttras and on meditation. but too little has been written on how the teachings of Buddhism were recovered so that people in the West (and, in fact, people in Asia as well) could learn from them.<br /><br />Charles Allen's book, \\"The Search for the Buddha: The Men who Discovered India's Lost Religion\\" (2003) helps fill this void. Mr. Allen was born in India to a family with a long record of service to British India and has published several other books dealing with India.  His book deals only lightly with Buddhist teachings and doctrines.  The book's focus is the activities of a remarkable group of people who, beginning late in the 18th Century, discovered the languages, texts, sacred sites, and teachings of Buddhism and thus prepared the way for their study and recognition.  These individuals worked in not only in India, but in Ceylon, Burma, Nepal, and Tibet as well.<br /><br />The task of discovering Buddhism in India was not as easy as might be supposed since Buddhism had essentially been driven out of India centuries before the British empire.  Many of the earliest discoveries of Buddhism were made by employees of the East India Company or the British Government who were amateurs in the study of religion and archaeology and who were sent to England for other reasons.  Thus Dr. Francis Buchanan, who wrote early studies of Buddhism in Burma and Nepal was a surgeon with an interest in Botany.  Sir William Jones, who established the Asiatic Society and became known as \\"Oriental\\" Jones was a Judge. The brilliant James Princep who unraveled a difficult Sanskrit script was trained as a scientist and also was a pioneer in the study of numismatics (coins). Csmoa de Koros was a Hungarian who made the wealth of Tibetan scriptures available to the West as a result of his quixotical notion that Tibetans constituted a sort of lost tribe of Hungarians.<br /><br />These Orientalists made lasting discoveries about the history of Buddhist India, its languages and sacred sites.  Mr. Allen documents their work with a great deal of detail, which I found confusingly organized at times.  But there is no doubt of the significance of their endeavors.<br /><br />The last chapters of the book discuss early students of Buddhism who were more familiar to me.  These individuals include the notorious Russian founder of Theosophy, Madame Blavatsky and her one-time assistant Colonel Henry Olcott from the United States. Sir Edwin Arnold, a British newspaper editor composed a famous epic poem in 1879 about the Buddha, \\"The Light of Asia\\" which brought Buddhism to the attention of many people in Britain and the United States. Rhys Davis founded the Pali Text Society in 1881, and this group played an invaluable and still ongoing role in making early Buddhist texts available in translation.  Dr Lawrence Waddell, a physician, wrote in 1897 an early, highly critical, book about Tibetan Buddhism and also made important archaeological discoveries.<br /><br />I found the discussion of this latter group of pioneers in the study of Buddhism more accessible than the earlier part of the book, probably because I had some background in their work. But the entire book makes a fascinating study of how the basic facts of Buddhism were learned and organized and brought to the West.  The book is replete with many photographs and drawings which help explain and give context to the text.<br /><br />Mr. Allen writes with affection for Buddhism and with a high, if critical and nuanced regard, for the achievement of the British in India.  This book will interest readers interested in the development of knowledge about Buddhism and readers interested in the history of the British in India.itish in India.	2005-02-01

It is short, enigmatic, and profound and has been the subject of more commentary than any other Buddhist text.  It is a basic Scripture of Mahayana Buddhism, a broad Buddhist movement that arose in reaction to the earlier teachings which today are called Theravada Buddhism. (The relationship between Mahayana and Theravada is one of the themes of this book.)<br /><br />The Heart Sutra is best known for its difficult statement, \\"form is empty; emptiness is form\\" and for the mantra included in the text, usually translated \\"gone, gone, gone completely beyond, enlightenment\\".<br /><br />The earliest surviving commentaries on the Heart Sutra were written in India between 750 and 1050 A.D. which, historically, is near the end of the period of the development of Buddhism in India. There are eight commentaries of varying lengths and perspectives. The original versions of these commentaries in Sanskrit do not survive, but they have been passed down in their Tibetan translations.  The Heart Sutra became an integral part of Tibetan Buddhism, and a recent commentary has been published by the Dalai Lama.<br /><br />Professor Donald Lopez of the University of Michigan is the author of many books on Buddhism which manage somehow to be scholarly, naturalistic, and inspiring at the same time.  In 1988, he published a book with the overly-ambitious title, \\"The Heart Sutra Explained\\" in which he discussed seven of the eight ancient Indian commentaries.  His more recent book, \\"Elaborations on Emptiness: Uses of the Heart Sutra\\" (1996)includes translations of all eight of the early commentaries interspersed with Professor Lopez's own commentary and essays.<br /><br />Professor Lopez has written a formidable book indeed, but one which will reward study.  The book discusses in detail the Heart Sutra, the commentaries, Buddhist practices and beliefs on which the commentaries were based, and the nature and limitations of commentarial interpretation.<br /><br />The book opens with the text of the Heart Sutra which should be read carefully before the reader begins.  Professor Lopez's essays discuss major issues in the interpretation of the Heart Sutra, and he attempts to explain why the early commentators focused on the issues that they did.  Thus Lopez discusses the phrase \\"Thus have I heard\\" with which the Heart Sutra, in common with most Buddhist Sutras, opens and discusses the divergent commentarial views of who is speaking and why this issue is important to interpretation.  Lopez discusses whether the Heart Sutra is, as some commentators have taken it, part of the Tantric school of Buddhism; and he explores the underlying question of what Tantra is.  There is a fascinating chapter on the use of visualizations in Buddhist meditation together with a lengthy discussion of the meditation-drama associated in some commentaries with the text of the Sutra.  Professor Lopez discusses the use of the Heart Sutra as part of an exorcism rite in Tibet, which will come as a corrective to those students who take an overly rationalistic view of Buddhist practice.  Professor Lopez concludes with reflections on the nature of commentarial interpretation, both as practiced in ancient India and in today's world, emphasizing the purpose and difficulty of commentary and how it both illuminates and obscures a text.  He draws on modern critical theory for his discussion, with good use of the work of Hans Gadamer and illuminating references to the use of commentary in Judaism, among other sources.<br /><br />Lopez's discussions flow well into and illuminate the texts of the eight Indian commentators.  They show as well why the commentaries as well as the Heart Sutra remain provocative, timeless and obscure.<br /><br />This is a scholarly book which presupposes a certain background in Buddhism in the reader.  It is tough-minded and academically rigourous.  Professor Lopez shows a loveand devotion for the texts, but he writes to show Westerners with perhaps an overly-rationalistic and anacronistic vision of Buddhism something of the nature of Buddhist belief and practice that often tends to be overlooked.<br /><br />The fact remains, I think, that any profound text is greater than the sum of its commentaries.  This is true of the Heart Sutra.  I found myself chastened by this book but inspired to return to and attempt to draw wisdom from the Heart Sutra.Lopez shows a love and devotion for the texts, but he writes to show Westerners with perhaps an overly-rationalistic and anacronistic vision of Buddhism something of the nature of Buddhist belief and practice that often tends to be overlooked. <br /> <br />The fact remains, I think, that any profound text is greater than the sum of its commentaries.

Ragtime flourished from roughly 1900 -- 1920 when it faded into obscurity with the advent of jazz. It enjoyed a revival beginning in the 1970s with the movie \\"The Sting\\", several popular recordings, and the production of Joplin's opera Treemonisha.  Ragtime is an enchanting American music, both lyrical and strongly rhythmical that has components of both classical music and jazz.  I greatly enjoy playing Joplin's rags on the piano as well as the rags of his lesser-known but gifted colleagues, James Scott and Joseph Lamb.<br /><br />A full account of ragtime and its place in American culture remains to be written.  Susan Curtis's book, \\"Dancing to a Black Man's Tune: A Life of Scott Joplin\\" is a start.  Dr Curtis is Professor of History and American Studies and Director of Interdisciplinary Studies at Purdue University.  It is thus understandable that her book draws widely on American history and on relationships between African Americans and whites in attempting to understand Scott Joplin and ragtime.<br /><br />Dr. Curtis discusses the important stages in Joplin's life and relates them to ongoing events in the United States with an emphasis on how African American - white relations impacted his music. She emphasizes, and necessarily so, the effects of slavery (one of Joplin's parents had been a slave) and of Reconstruction and Jim Crow.  Dr. Curtis describes how African Americans remained on the outside of white America to a large extent. Still, African American music, ragtime in particular, had a great appeal for white Americans and led to the ideal of an inter-racial American culture.<br /><br />But Dr. Curtis's book shows, I think, that African American -- white relationships resist any simple summary.  Joplin surely suffered from the effects of slavery and the rise of Jim Crow and from discrimination throughout his life.  But Dr. Curtis also points out the ways in which black and white people worked together, how white people helped Joplin, and how Joplin encouraged the work of white composers of \\"negro\\" music.  Joplin received piano lessons as a child from a German immigrant who recognized his talent.  His music gained attention, probably, at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893 even though it lacked official status.  There was substantial efforts at inter-racial harmony in Sedalia, Missouri where Joplin settled after a lengthy period as a wandering musician.  His music was published and supported by John Stark, a white entrepeneur and he received encouragement from other white critics.  When he moved to New York City, Joplin befriended and assisted in the publication of rags by Joseph Lamb, a gifted white composer of the music. Thus there was a great deal of complex interaction between black and white people in the origins and development of ragtime.<br /><br />The book includes considerations of Joplin's childhood in Texas, his years as a wandering musician, his life in Sedalia which saw the publication of \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" and other early successes, and his final years in New York.  The discussion is informed by a great deal of consideration of American history which sometimes causes the book to lose focus.  Dr Curtis shows well how Americans were fascinated by ragtime, although the music was subjected to severe and frequently racist opposition, due to the vicarious opportunity it offered to escape late 19th Century Victorian conventions, particularly those sexual in nature, and to liberate oneself.<br /><br />I found the most insightful sections of Dr. Curtis's book were those that discussed Joplin's relationship with the African American community of his day.  When he experienced a degree of success, Joplin moved to New York City but failed in his efforts to gain acceptance by many of the African American musicians and intellectuals in Harlem. Dr Curtis suggests that Joplin had experienced for himself the poverty and difficultyof life in the South in the aftermath of the Civil War while many of the Northern African American leaders, such as W.E.B. DuBois, had themselves received excellent educationas and knew this life only at second-hand.  The best section of the book for me thus was Dr. Curtis's treatment of Joplin's failed opera Treemonisha, on which he lavished a great deal of attention following his move to New York.  This folk-opera, in dialect (Joplin wrote his own libretto) was probably autobiographical in nature and described life in the rural South following the Civil War. It was out-of step with the then-beginning Harlem Rennaisance.  Dr Curtis shows how ragtime showed disagreements within the African American community as well as occupying an ambiguous position in promoting black and white relationships.<br /><br />The tone of the book is rather dry and academic.  I found this unfortunate, scholarly as the book is, in that any book on ragtime or on music, scholarly or not, needs to sing to be effective.  I found Dr. Curtis gave too little attention to the purely musical aspects of ragtime.  The book has an extensive bibliography, good notes, and shows thought.  Dr. Curtis sees ragtime as a step in the direction of an American culture which transcends racial lines and is shared by all Americans.  She points out that this is a goal and ideal which has proved elusive and is worth pursuing by Americans today.  By writing seriously about Scott Joplin and about ragtime, Dr Curtis's book may take a step in that direction.nd difficulty of life in the South in the aftermath of the Civil War while many of the Northern African American leaders, such as W.E.B.

US	48185764	R1QH6MOISWCED9	019816484X	601057113	Brahms (Master Musicians Series)	Books	5	19	20	N	N	MacDonald's Brahms	A colleague of mine noticed the picture of the young Brahms on the cover of MacDonald's biography.  She remarked with surprise on his handsome, vigorous appearance.  Too often people tend to think of Brahms as an old, bearded, somewhat overweight composer of conservative romantic music.  The text of MacDonald's ambitious study, together with the cover portrait, aims to dispel stereotypes held by many about Brahms.  For MacDonald, Johannes Brahms (1833 --1897) was an unabashedly romantic composer (granting the difficulties of defining that notoriously difficult term, \\"romantic\\"), with strong ties to the musical past who looked forward to and helped create the linear, contrapuntal, and decidedly unromantic music of the twentieth century.  MacDonald's interest in the relationship between Brahms and Schoenberg is understandable as he has written a companion volume on Schoenberg for the \\"Master Musicians\\" series.<br /><br />The book is both a biography of Brahms and a musical study with heavy emphasis on the latter. In the biographical sections of his account, MacDonald covers briefly Brahms's childhood in the rough, seafaring districts of Hamburg,his early musical instruction, and his wide reading. He describes Brahms's relationship with the Schumann's and the ambiguities of his lifelong love for Clara Schumann. There is a great deal of emphasis on Brahms's inability to marry, despite several flames in his youth.  MacDonald describes how love and passion inform Brahms's work throughout and how music helped Brahms give voice to feelings that, for whatever reason, he could not express in his life.<br /><br />MacDonald also places Brahms in a musical context that includes his extensive study of his predecessors, from his contemporaries through Schubert, Beethoven, Mozart, and Haydn, to the baroque and earlier.  Brahms was undoubtedly the most musically learned of the great composers and he was able to integrate his learning with his own romantic voice.  MacDonald finds that Brahms remained throughout his life a romantic composer.  This means, I think, that Brahms saw music as an essentially spiritual calling, somewhat of a substitute for the role revealed religion plays in the lives of many, which emphasizes romantic and physical love, the unity of man with nature, and the value of the past.  Bach used the past in his devotion to early music and to folksongs of many types.  Brahms's romanticism, and the manner in which he integrated it with counterpoint and variation, paved the way for the destruction of romanticism and for the creation of a more recognizably modern sensibility.<br /><br />I found the most valuable part of MacDonald's book to be the detailed analyses he offers of virtually all Brahm's major works.  The discussion is presented chronologically.  The musical discussions generally follow the biographical sections of the book and deal with Brahms's compositions by categories: orchestral music, chamber music, choral music, piano, song.  MacDonald offers numerous musical examples, discusses the history of each work, and integrates each work nicely into a discussion of the entirety of Brahms's output.<br /><br />Reading this book impressed upon me the wide variety of masterpieces Brahms composed during his life. MacDonald's accounts can be followed by the nonspecialist and give an inspiring picture of Brahms and his music.  While reading, I thought of the works of Brahms with which I am familiar and wanted to revisit them in light of MacDonald's discussion.  I also thought of the many works of Brahms I don't know but would love to explore in light of what I learned from the book.  Little more can be asked from a musical study.<br /><br />MacDonald writes with a deep affection for Brahms which he conveys well to his readers. He writes that Brahms \\"has been my favorite composer ever since I was old enough to think about music\\" (at x) and it shows in the deep thought and work represented in this study.  MacDonald's closing discussion of Brahms's output captures well his view of Brahms.  He writes: \\"Aware of the tragedies, paradoxes, and imponderables of existence, Brahms wrote to provide sustenance for the here and now.  His music seeks to give beauty, nobility, a sense of meaning to the brute fact of human transience.\\" (p. 401)<br /><br />This is an outstanding study which should inspire the reader to hear Brahms, or to rehear him with an awakened heart.closing discussion of Brahms's output captures well his view of Brahms.

I was pleased to read this collection of Steinbeck's novels, written from 1942 -- 1952,in the Library of America series.  They are of varied lengths, varying settings, and varied themes.  Yet they show a writer with a broad continuity of themes including people, the land, American values, human sexuality, the importance of culture and education, and much else. It may be useful to explore some of the threads among the novels collected in this volume.<br /><br />Steinbeck wrote his short novel \\"The Moon is Down\\" in 1941 following a request by the Foreign Information Service to assist American propaganda efforts during WW II.  The story is set in an unnamed Scandanavian country which, when the book opens, has been invaded by Germany.  Although the book is short, the characterizations are diverse and effective as Steinbeck gives the reader portraits of the German office corps, and of the people of the town, including the mayor, a collaborator with the enemy, and a young woman, Molly, whose husband has been shot by the invaders.  I particularly enjoyed the use Steinbeck made of the products of human creativity and thought in his story which emphasizes the priceless nature of human freedom.  Thus, the climactic scene of the story includes a discussion of Plato's Apology among the mayor, his friend, and the German commander.  Another critical scene in the book turns on the love poetry of the German poet Heinrich Heine.  In this novel, Steinbeck met the aims of the Foreign Information Service, but more importantly he produced a defense of human liberty that far transcended these aims.<br /><br />In the next book in this collection, Cannery Row,(1944) Steinbeck deliberately avoided the war. He claimed that he wrote the book as \\"a kind of nostalgic thing ... for a group of soldiers who had said to me: 'Write something funny that isn't about the war.  Write something for us to read -- we're sick of war.\\"<br /><br />The book is set in Steinbeck's beloved Monterey, California during the depression.  The main character in the book, Doc, is modeled on Steinbeck's friend Ed Ricketts, a marine biologist.  Doc befriends a group of Cannery Row denizens of the local flophouse -- headed by a character named Mack -- and the relationship between Doc and the \\"Palace Flophouse\\" residents forms the basis for most of the scenes in this book.  Other characters include Dora, the madam of the Bear Flag Restaurant who is sympathetically portrayed.  As we will see, Steinbeck portrayed madams in other books with a much harsher view.  I was surprised to find in this book a discussion of an ancient Sanskrit love poem, \\"Black Marigolds\\" together with discussions by Doc of Monteverdi, Bach, Beethoven and Debussy. The importance Steinbeck attached to high products of human thought and creativity is sometimes overlooked.<br /><br />The third novel in this collection is the brief work, \\"The Pearl\\" (1947) which, unfortunately, has become the bane of many young readers who have the work forced upon them.  Both the book and the readers deserve a better fate.  The book takes place in Mexico and is a story that shows the effect upon a poor family of discovering a pearl of great wealth.  It is simply and eloquently told.  Steinbeck describes his book as \\"a parable\\" in which \\"perhaps everyone takes his own meaning from it and reads his own life into it.\\"  The book makes great use of song imagery as we are told at the outset that the people of the Mexican village \\"had been great makers of songs so that everything they saw or thought or did or heard became a song.\\"  The main character, Kino, hears in his heart various songs throughout the book, the most important of which is the \\"Song of the Family\\" or the \\"Whole\\" which celebrates his life with his wife and new baby. This is a short, beautiful story which glows withthe many colors and ambiguities as did the pearl which Kino discovers.<br /><br />The final novel in this collection, and the longest by far is \\"East of Eden\\" which Steinbeck wrote in a burst of energy in 1951.  This was Steinbeck's favorite among all his works and he literally put himself into it in the person of the narrator.<br /><br />Steinbeck said that he wrote \\"East of Eden\\" to tell \\"the story of my country and the story of me\\" to his two young sons in order to demonstrate \\"the greatest story of all -- the story of good and evil, of strength and weakness, of love and hate, of beauty and ugliness, how these doubles are inseparable.\\"  For all its melodrama, length, sometimes black-and-white characterizations, and preachiness, the novel achieves its goals.  I was transfixed by the book.<br /><br />Most of the story takes place in the Salinas Valley of Northern California and involves the saga of two families, the Hamiltons and the Trasks.  There are two Trask brothers, Adam and Charles, and twin sons of Adam, (presumably), and his wife Cathy -- Aron and Caleb. Both Adam and Charles and Aron and Caleb replicate in their own ways the Biblical story of Cain and Abel.  Steinbeck gives this story a full biblical style exegisis as the reader sees the story of the conflict between good and evil play out in double over the course of the book.<br /><br />This book features another madam, Kate -- or Cathy Trask whom Steinbeck describes as a \\"monster\\".  This is a far different woman than the Dora of \\"Cannery Row\\".<br /><br />This book portrays strikingly the good and evil of which people are capable and their capacity to make choices -- to understand the good and reject the evil.  Steinbeck writes in a humanistic rather than in a theological way.<br /><br />In summary, this volume includes four different yet related works by an outstanding American author.  This book will reward reading by those who wish to explore some of the great literature that has been written in the United States.

Hassan is part of a Muslim group called Hazaras which suffered grave discrimination in Afghani society.  He and Amir become fast friends until, at the age of 12, Amir betrays Hassan in a series of chilling incidents. Hassan and his father leave Baba and the employ of his family, and, ultimately, Baba and Amir emigrate to the United States with the Russian invasion of Afganistan.  Amir's guilt accompanies him to America.  As the story unfolds, Amir marries, becomes a successful novelist, is called back to Afganistan by Rahim Kahn, his father's former business partner, and, after, extraordinary trials, achieves a measure of self-understanding and redemption.<br /><br />I found the novel worked better in parts than as a whole.  The book features several raw, graphic incidents of violence and brutality which are well-prepared and convincingly portrayed.  The picture of life in Afganistan, prior to the overthrow of its monarchy, through the Russian invasion, and the triumph of the Taliban is convincing. Hosseini has a feel for his homeland and I thought upon completing the novel that I knew something that I had not known before about a land that had been totally obscure to me.<br /><br />I also greatly enjoyed the picture of Afghan emigre life in San Francisco, with its garage sales, attempts to adjust to a new culture and language, and attempts to maintain traditions.  I thought the author gave a sympathetic portrayal of these emigres and their situation and, more importantly, wrote with an obvious affection throughout for the United States as a land still full of hope and opportunity for dispossessed people. This I found inspiring. Hosseini's theme could readily have degenerated into polemics.<br /><br />I thought the characterizations in the book and the development of the theme of sin and redemption effective on the whole.  They were marred, for me, by too much melodrama and by clumsy, unconvincing plotting.  The story line of the book is contrived and forced, particularly after Amir returns to Afganistan.  For all its violence, the story fits together too neatly with too many coincidences, taking a great deal away from the overall effectiveness of the novel.<br /><br />In sum, the book explores a universal human condition and does so well.

He initially prepared a draft of a play centering upon German occupation of a town in the United States.  This setting did not meet with approval from the Foreign Information Service, and Steinbeck revised his work.  He wrote a short novel set in a small town in an unnamed Scandanavian country which had been subjected to German invasion and occupation.  The resulting book \\"The Moon is Down\\" was published in 1942. It was transformed into a play and opened on Broadway later that year. A film version of the book appeared in 1943; and, in 1946, Steinbeck was awarded the King Haakon Liberty Cross from Norway for this novel.<br /><br />Today, \\"The Moon is Down\\" is less well-known that some of Steinbeck's other works, but it bears comparison with his best.<br />The story moves quickly, the characterizations are effective, and the story rises to make eloquently its timeless point about the nature of human liberty.<br /><br />The story opens when the Germans invade by sea a small village to exploit its coal resources in the war effort.  For a short novel, the story presents a variety of characters and each of them is individually developed.  These include the German commander, Colonel Lanser, a man of education and culture, swift to obey all orders but who has serious inner doubts about Germany's war effort and aims.  We also meet several members of Colonel Lanser's Officer Corps, some of whom are full of themselves and of military ambition, while others are lonely and feel the greatest need for the companionship of a woman.<br /><br />The book also includes good characterizations of the townspeople.  Among others, the reader meets Corell, the local who collaborates with the Germans and facilitates the invasion, the mayor of the town, Mayor Orden, his friend, Dr Winter, and a woman of indominitable spirit, Molly, whose husband has been shot by the invaders.  The book shows the conflict and enmity that develops between the invaders and the invaded as the Germans resort to ever-harsher methods to secure the coal and the townspeople stiffen their resistance in defense of freedom.  For all that Steinbeck recognizes the common humanity of all the characters in his story, the book is a ringing affirmation of freedom and of the human spirit.  The work is far more than a simple propaganda effort.<br /><br />The book makes emphatic use of products of human creativity and thought in emphasizing the value of human freedom.  The climactic scene of the book includes a lengthy discussion of Plato's Apology in which Mayor Orden, Dr. Winter, and Colonel Lanser all participate.  Earlier in the book, at another key moment, love poetry by the German author Heinrich Heine plays a crucial role in moving the story forward.<br /><br />I found \\"The Moon is Down\\" much more effective than some of Steinbeck's other short novels which are frequently forced upon young readers.  While the book is short and easy to read, it is a work of some complexity and of varied characters.  Steinbeck in this work met the aims of the Foreign Information Service; but, more importantly, he produced a work of literature that transcended the goals of the war effort.as been shot by the invaders.

Turn over to me the jewel, lotus, and radiant light.\\"  As the use of this mantra developed, its recitation was frequently combined with a ritual involving the sprinkling of a pure grade of sand.<br /><br />In \\"Shingon Refractions\\", Mark Unno, an assistant professor of East Asian Religions at the University of Oregon, has written an account of what was to me this little-known practice as it developed in Japanese Buddhism.  As the title of the book suggests, the mantra was used in the Japanes school of Shingon Buddhism.  Shingon is a Tantric, esoteric form of Buddhism akin to the Buddhism most Westerners associate with Tibet.  Subsequent developments of Buddhism in Japan, including Zen, Pure Land, and Nichren, are generally more familiar to Westerners interested in Buddhism than is Shingon.  But Shingon, Professor Unno teaches the reader, is a growing movement and the mantra of light has been adopted by Buddhists in many other traditions.<br /><br />The principal character in Professor Unno's account is a monk of thirteenth-century Japan, Myoe Koben (1173-1232) who also had been unfamiliar to me.  Myoe was a scholar-monk ordained in two different traditions of Japanese Buddhism.  In the final years of his life, he became greatly interested in the mantra of light and wrote about it extensively. Translations of six of Myoe's writings are included in this book.<br /><br />Professor Unno gives a brief account of the history of the mantra of light and an all-too-brief account of the various schools of Japanese Buddhism.  He follows this introduction with a detailed account of how Myoe developed the mantra, and the use of the sand, and of the significance he attached to it.  It is  Professor Unno's account of the significance of the mantra that makes this book come alive for the modern reader.  Professor Unno gives a distinctly modern cast to this ancient mantra.  Unno describes how Myoe, ordained in two traditions, did not view any form of Buddhism dogmatically but rather saw each apparently competing tradition from the perspective of the Buddhist doctrine of emptyness.  Myoe was an eclectic who drew from scriptures and practices of the different forms of Buddhism then arising in Japan, including both Zen and Pure Land, as well as the tantric practices of Shingon.  Myoe did not tie his teachings to a specific human lineage, but instead went back to the Buddha and ultimately to the teaching of emptiness.  He taught a form of Buddhism accessible to the learned and the ignorant, to the saint and to the sinner.  His Buddhism stressed equality among persons and, in particular, expanded the role of women.  Perhaps most importantly, Myoe taught a faith-based Buddhism emphasizing the importance, in a degenerate age, of faith in the Dharma.  The mantra and the sand ritual were not magical acts but rather owned their force to the expressions of faith they conveyed.  That is why Myoe was open to the use of other teachings, mantras, and practices which originated in faith.<br /><br />Unno gives a good account of a difficult topic which was new to me and, I suspect, will be new to many Western students of Buddhism.  He illuminates his discussion with quotations from Myoe and by comparisons between Myoe and other Buddhist and Taoist writers.  He draws some modern analogies that had particular meaning for me -- such as in his story (pp. 82-83)of a young girl who hears a performance of a Beethoven piano sonata and is inspired to persevere with diligence and faith over the years to master the instrument.  This faith and perseverence to learn the piano after becoming aware of a distant goal -- playing Beethoven -- is analogized beautifully to faith in the Dharma.<br /><br />Some of the translations of Myoe's works helped me with this book, particularly the essay \\"Recommending Faith in the Sand of the Mantra of Light\\"  and the \\"Chronicle of Things Not to be Forgotten\\", the latter prepared by a student of Myoe.  Some of the other Myoe texts were too detailed and difficult for one coming to the subject for the first time.<br /><br />Professor Unno has written an insightful if difficult study of an area of Buddhism that seemed to me highly remote. More develpment of background of Japanese Buddhism and of the mantra itself would have been welcome.  I couldn't avoid thinking, as I read this book, that Professor Unno was gearing his presentation to appeal to the needs and predelictions of modern Westerners who try to follow the Dharma in the United States. This is certainly an appropriate way to frame a historical account, but I found at times that Professor Unno was more interested in contemporary Buddhist practice than in a historical exposition of the mantra of light.<br /><br />This book is not suitable for the casual reader or for those coming to Buddhism for the first time.  It will appeal to readers with some familiarity with and feeling for Buddhism and the Dharma.mmending Faith in the Sand of the Mantra of Light\\"  and the \\"Chronicle of Things Not to be Forgotten\\", the latter prepared by a student of Myoe.

US	48185764	R3SE7WECB7CWW5	093039528X	550961062	Emma Lazarus Rediscovered	Books	4	6	6	N	N	In Search of Emma Lazarus	Emma Lazarus (1849-1887) achieved lasting fame with her sonnet, \\"The New Colossus\\" written in 1883 as part of a fund-raising effort for the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty. In 1903, Lazarus's sonnet was inscribed on the Statue.  It has become an icon in its own right and a symbol of the visions and ideals of the United States.<br /><br />Lazarus's writings other than \\"The New Colossus\\" have been relegated to undeserved obscurity. Eve Merriam's book, \\"Emma Lazarus Rediscovered\\" initially was published in 1956 under the title \\"Emma Lazarus: Woman with a Torch\\" and republished in 1999 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Emma Lazarus's birth. The new edition includes an introduction and conclusion by Morris Schappes, a noted Lazarus scholar, and sells for a bargain price.  It is good to have this book available and accessible to encourage an exploration of the works of Emma Lazarus.<br /><br />Lazarus's life remains obscure and shrouded in legend.  The definitive account of her life and achievement remains to be written. Lazarus was born into a wealthy and assmimilated family of American Jews whose ancestors had settled in the United States before the Revolutionary War.  She received the best private education available and early showed an interest in poetry which her father encouraged.  Her work was published while Lazarus was still in her teens.  She met Emerson who also encouraged her and became something of a mentor.  She never married.  Contrary to the picture some have of Emma Lazarus as a recluse, she was highly social with many influential friends in the upper reaches of American society and government. She did show, however, great reluctance to speak or appear in public.<br /><br />Much of the enigman of Emma Lazarus concerns her attitude towards Judaism.  She published some poems and essays on Jewish themes from an early age, but in the early 1880s. with the advent of the Pogroms in Russia, her Jewish writing intensified.  She published a volume of poetry, \\"Songs of a Semite\\" which, as compared to her earlier somewhat conventional work, shows a writer with her own voice.  She wrote lengthy essays on Jewish themes in many of the leading periodicals of the day attacking anti-Semitism and the Pogroms and praising Judaism for bringing ethical monotheism, and a love for truth, knowledge and justice to the world.  Towards the end of her life, she studied Hebrew, but she never became a practicing Jew.<br /><br />Eve Merriam's study heavily emphasizes the Jewish aspect of Emma Lazarus and argues strongly for Lazarus's commitment to Judaism.  Her biography is largely drawn from Lazarus's published works - her poems and essays -- and she sees these works as integral to understanding Lazarus.  A great virtue of Merriam's study is the extensive quotations it gives from Lazarus's writings which for most readers will be unfamiliar and inaccessible.  But her study is weak on documentation and pays too little attention to the record Lazarus's life separate from her published works.<br /><br />Following the initial publication of Merriam's book, a biography of Emma Lazarus appeared in 1995 by Bette Roth Young title \\"Emma Lazarus in her World.\\"  I reviewed this book on this site some years ago. Young paid little attention to Lazarus's published writings.  Instead, she studied closely other evidence, in particular the many letters that Lazarus wrote to friends. Ms. Young concluded that Emma Lazarus showed throughout her life an ambivalent attitude towards Judaism.  She was never fully in it nor fully without it but admired it and tried to explain it to her friends in something of the manner of the outsider.  Lazarus' milieu remained the world of culture and art of upper-society New York, with her Jewish interests resting somewhat uneasily and peripherally in this environment.<br /><br />Merriam's and Young's books compliment each other, but neither captures the full Emma Lazarus.  Merriam's book comes closer for me in helping to understand her. Merriam emphasizes Emma Lazarus's love for the United States and sees her poem on the Statue of Liberty -- and other similar works as exemplifying a goal and an ideal for our Nation as a beacon for the world and as a source of human freedom and opportunity.  She also shows, from her discussions of Emma Lazarus's writings, that Lazarus has much to contribute to modern discussions of American nationalism and of religious commitments.  Lazarus became attracted to a form of Judaism emphasizing ethical behavior and universalism. She was distinctly uncomfortable with some of the rituals brought to the United States by the immigrants from the Pogroms and looked towards the development of a secularized, rationalistic, but still emotional religion. This is still a legitimate but elusive goal for many people. Lararus, as far as I can tell, does indeed display the ambivalences that Ms Young describes, but these ambivalences make her a vital figure rather than a somewhat marginal one as Ms. Young seems to assume.<br /><br />The value of Merriam's book is that it gives us Emma Lazarus in her own words and shows the reader that she is a writer who can teach and inspire.  Emma Lazarus deserves a revival.<br /><br />I understand that the Library of America Poets Project will be publishing  a selection of Emma Lazarus's poetry early in 2005.  I look forward to reading it and hope that it attains a wide audience.lping to understand her.

US	48185764	R9F9AUVGCBLQM	0811215571	800974816	George Oppen: Selected Poems	Books	5	16	16	N	N	A Singular Poet	Although his masterpiece is titled \\"Of Being Numerous\\", George Oppen (1908 -- 1984) led a singular life and wrote in a singular voice.  His poetry explores the tensions between the multiplicity of images, places, ideas, and people, and the solitary self.  This selection of Oppen's poetry edited by Robert Creeley includes poems from each of Oppen's published books together with an introductory essay by Creeley,  Oppen's only essay, and a useful chronology.  It is an excellent introduction to a too-little known American poet.<br /><br />Oppen led a singular life in that, among other reasons, he began his writing career in the mid-1930s and then underwent a 24-year silence before returning to poetry in 1958.  During this time, Oppen travelled with his wife, Mary, worked as a social activist and as a machinist, served in the U.S. Army during WW II, and was active in the communist party.  His writing reflects a varied and complex life.<br /><br />Oppen's poetic voice was also singular.  In the mid-1930's he became associated with other important American poets, including William Carlos Williams, Carl Rakosi, Louis Zukofsky, and Charles Reznikoff who wrote in a style described as \\"objectivist\\".  Their writing aims at conciseness, understatement and particularity.  Oppen and his peers tried to create a new poetic language free of convention and stock responses and showing -- or being -- a perception of the world.  Oppen's poetry remains true throughout to the teachings of objectivism.  But his writing seems to me more philosophically oriented and tends more to a treatment of ideals and questions than the poetry of his fellows.<br /><br />In the 1960's, Oppen deepened his friendship with the Jewish-American poet Charles Reznikoff and often toured and read with him.  Reznikoff's poetry is clear and simple and frequently trends towards Jewish themes. Reznikoff has always been one of my quiet heroes. I find Oppen much harder to read.  And, although he was born to an assimilated Jewish family, there is little of Jewish content in Oppen's poetry.  Still, there are commonalities between the two.<br /><br />A poem I particularly enjoyed in this collection was \\"Image of the Engine\\" written in 1962.  This poem is in five short sections and has been the subject of considerable commentary.  It contrasts the cold, impersonal character of a machine, and of the mechanistic civilization based upon it, with the human heart, the need for love and companionship and with \\"the heart thundering/Absolute desire\\".  Walt Whitman was throughout a great influence on Oppen.  I find the best way to approach this poem is as exploring the same themes as Whitman's famous poem, \\"To a Locomotive in Winter\\".  I don't think Oppen accepts Whitman's optimism on the role of the machine.<br /><br />But the greatest poem in this book is Oppen's long work, \\"Of Being Numerous\\" for which he received the Pulitzer Prize in 1969.  This is a poem in 40 short sections which is richly allusive to Blake, William Carlos Williams, and Whitman, among many others.  The poem ends with a prose quotation from Whitman.<br /><br />Oppen begins his poem:<br /><br />\\"There are things<br /><br />We live among 'and to see them<br /><br />Is to know ourselves'.\\"<br /><br />Much of the poem is a celebration of the diversity of life and experiences in Manhattan coupled with reflections on how the heart of the individual remains one and itself through the multiplicity.  (Hence the title and the discussion of \\"numerosity\\")  In its reflections on numerosity and on the individual, Oppen takes up again Whitman's themes.  But he does so in a restrained, disciplined, and focused style. The poem moves seamlessly through a variety of issues such as love, war, social activism and the role of poetry.  It is a great modern American poem in the tradition of Whitman but in a unique voice.<br /><br />Although lengthy, \\"Of Being Numerous\\" is more accessible and easier to follow than many of the shorter, more crystallized poems included in this volume.<br /><br />I also enjoyed Oppen's collection \\"Some San Francisco Poems\\" (1972) which does for San Francisco what \\"Of Being Numerous\\" does for Manhattan.  Oppen was a wanderer and describes the sea, the Bahamas, the European Theatre of WW II, his birthplace of New Rochelle and other places throughout his poetry.  But I am most taken with his settings in New York and San Franciso and with his descriptions of industrialization and modernity.<br /><br />Oppen's poetry needs to be read and reread over time.

But this book encourages the reader to pause, change direction, and reflect upon the meaning of the battle through art and meditation.<br /><br />The book is a collaboration between photographer Chris Heisey and writer Kent Gramm.  Mr. Heisey is a noted Civil War photographer who, he states in his introduction, has visited Gettysburg over 1200 times. This book centers upon 66 color photographs of the Battlefield that he has taken during the course of his visits.  Mr. Gramm, the author of \\"Gettysburg: a Meditation on War and Values\\" (1994) has written 66 poems which accompany the photographs together with an evocative introduction.  The book also includes a brief historical summary of the Battle of Gettysburg  and an index of images.<br /><br />Heisey and Gramm's work encourages reflection on the manner in which a battle which produced enormous death, suffering, and sorrow, has been transformed to a place of quiet beauty and peace.  They consider the Battle as part of a search for meaning and significance -- much as did Abraham Lincoln when he called upon Americans to address themselves collectively to a \\"New Birth of Freedom\\" following the battle.  Heisey and Gramm want to encourage reflection on the changes wrought by the Battle of Gettysburg on the United States, but their goal is deeper. They try to see Gettysburg as part of a process of personal self-transformation which encourages self-awareness and growth in one's own life based upon reflection on the sacrifice and heroism displayed on the Battlefield during the first three days of July, 1863.  Heisey and Gramm's reflections have a markedly religious character as well and they encourage the reader to see Gettysburg and its peace and stillness as an earthly image of eternity.  Visions of personal transformation and of spirituality are inspiring and appropriate ways to think about Gettysburg.<br /><br />Heisey's photographs are beautiful.  In his many visits to the battlefield he has mastered the use of color,light, and shadow. He has spent many hours, he tells the reader, watching the sunrise and sunset at the battlefield to learn the precise moment when a monument or other landmark will be cast in a unique light.  The photos are crisp and clear with many degrees of shading, red sunsets, the snow and ice of a Pennsylvania winter, the turning leaves of fall, the hot summers.  There are photographs of monuments, statues, the National Cemetery, landmarks  such as McPherson's Barn and the Wheatfield, fences, and scenes of nature on the Battlefield.  The photos will stimulate reflection in the reader.<br /><br />I found Kent Gramm's poems fit the texts well and helped me think about the Battle, but they are uneven in quality. (I had much the same reaction to his earlier book mentioned above.) On occasion, the poetry diverted my attention from the images.  The poetry is accessible and eloquent but I don't think it would stand up well on its own. Gramm writes in a variety of forms and appears particularly attracted to the sonnet.  There is a series of eight poems presented as variations of the 23d Psalm (pp. 47 --61)  Here is one of Gramm's poems I enjoyed, placed appropriately by a fog-shrouded photograph of Robert E. Lee on the Virginia Monument on Seminary Ridge. (pp. 14-15)<br /><br />  You mortals craning necks down there below,<br /><br />  if but this stone could make you understand:<br /><br />  it is more painful than you'll ever know<br /><br />  to wear your doubt and faith.

US	48185764	RUAVJESXFA5Q5	0385044518	260143252	A Stillness at Appomattox (Army of the Potomac, Vol. 3)	Books	5	39	39	N	N	Rereading A Stillness at Appomattox	Bruce Catton's &#34;A Stillness at Appomattox&#34; was the first adult Civil War book I attempted after, many years ago, I was captivated by a series of Civil War stories geared to pre-teens. Since that time, I have continued to read about the Civil War and recently have recaptured something of my boyish fascination with the subject -- I hope at a more thoughtful level.  I was reluctant to struggle with this particular book again because of the memory of my struggle with the book as a child. But I needed at last to go back to it to round out my reading of other works by Catton.<br /><br />Catton's book tells the story of the Civil War in the East beginning in the winter of 1863 following the Battle of Gettysburg.  The first thing to notice about the book is the clear, lyrical quality of the prose which somehow frustrated me as a child.  Catton writes in a propulsive forward-moving style.  He tends to like long sentences joined with series of &#34;ands&#34;.  This makes his account move quickly although sometimes a bit stringily.  Also Catton has a gift for lyrical metaphors to drive home his points -- whether in describing the fields or in describing the emotions of the men.  His writing at its best has a poetical, moving quality.  Most importantly, Catton writes lucidly.  His descriptions of the battles and of troop movements are relatively easy to follow.  Many of the accounts I have read since I first tried this book are detailed and ponderous. This is never the case with Catton.  He gives a good, basic picture of the battles he describes which will stand the reader looking for more detailed accounts in good stead.<br /><br />Besides the quality of the writing, A Stillness at Appomattox is notable for the story it has to tell. Broadly speaking, Catton focuses on how the Civil War changed after its first two years, and he explains why.  Although the carnage of the first two years of the war was immense, the scope of the war increased markedly following Gettysburg.  The Civil War became the first total war, bringing trench warfare, sustained fighting, destruction of property, and hardship to noncombatants in its wake.  Many later writers have also made this point, but Catton unforgettably drives it home.<br /><br />Catton thus describes the final Union campaign in the East (There is little in the book on the Western theatre of the War.) of the Army of the Potomac from the Wilderness through Spottsylvania, Cold Harbor, Petersburg, and Appomatox.  He describes the desparate, harsh nature of these engagements under the leadership of U.S. Grant.  Catton also pays a great deal of attention to Philip Sheridan, to the destruction he wrought in the Shenendoah Valley Campaign, and to his key roles in the Battle of Five Forks (Petersburg) and the final race to the Appomatox Court House.  Catton's discussion of Sheridan brought home to me the cruel all-out nature of the final stages of the War.<br /><br />Catton also integrates well the military aspects of the Civil  War with the political aspects. There are good pictures of Lincoln and of the war-weariness of the North which threatened the military efforts of the Armies until the last phases of the conflict.  Catton's work emphasizes, in line with recent scholarship, the critical role of African-American soldiers in the Union's war effort.  But he also tends to support a reconciliationist approach following the end of the conflict rather than what might have been a more committed attempt to protect the rights of the Freedmen.  Although Catton writes from the Union side of the line, he clearly is impressed with the military and personal character of Robert E. Lee and with the valor shown by the Army of Northern Virginia under the most trying of circumstances.<br /><br />I was enthralled by the pace of the book, by Catton's writing, and by his love for and knowledge of his subject.  This is a book to come to as an adult.  It will encourage the thoughtful reader to reflect upon the CivilWar as the watershed event in our Nation's history.<br /><br />Robin Friedman.

US	48185764	R1AQYFZ04NXFN0	0253211360	545575850	Gettysburg: A Meditation on War and Values	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Kent Gramm's Reflections on Gettysburg	I became interested in Kent Gramm's writings after reading his outstanding essay in  the collection \\"The Gettysburg Nobody Knows\\" edited by Gabor Boritt.  In that essay, Gramm discussed in a historicaly informed and reflective way the famous charge of the Second Minnesota to defend the Union center at a critical moment during the second day of the battle of Gettysburg.<br /><br />I thus read eagerly this reissue of Gramm's 1994 collection of essays \\"Gettysburg: A Meditation on War and Values.\\"  This collection has many of the characteristics that I found admirable in Gramm's essay on the Second Minnesota.  Gramm is a long-term and devoted student of the battle of Gettysburg.  He writes well and simply about the events of that pivotal battle.  But unlike many accounts, such as those by Coddington, Pfanz, Sears, Trudeau, and others, Gramm's book doesn't purport to be a history of the battle.  Rather, consists of highly personal reflections on the battle and its significance with discussions of the events of July 1 -- 3, 1863 interwoven with Gramm's thoughts.<br /><br />In eighteen short essays, Gramm discusses particular events of the battle such as the fighting at McPherson's woods, the seminary, and in the town of Gettysburg itself during the first day.  He discusses the action at the Round Tops, the Wheatfield, Culp's Hill, and, of course, Pickett's charge among other aspects of the battle.  He teaches the reader about the ground and the ambience of Gettysburg then and now and about the personalities that made the battle.<br /><br />Gramm's reflections are many layered.  He is preoccupied with theology and meaning.  He writes from a non-denominational, non-fundamentalist Christian perspective that shows a great deal of influence of Eastern religious thought.  I found what he had to say moving and thoughtful and tied in well to his reflections on Gettysburg, death, suffering, and war.<br /><br />Gramm also writes from a topical perspective.  He is critical of what he sees as the increasing materialism and shallowness of American culture.  His book, first published in 1994, is also critical of the first President Bush's war in Iraq and of what he perceives as other large shortcomings in American political life of the day.  Some of this material is tied in well with Gramm's discussion of the battle, but some of it seems to me unrelated, rambling, and unduly partisan.<br /><br />This book, unlike Gramm's essay on the First Minnesota (which does not appear in this volume) is thus a mixture of the wise and the irritating.  Although I don't agree with everything Gramm says or with Gramm's own political agenda, I found his book worthwhile as a way to approach the battle of Gettysburg. Gramm emphasizes the valor of the troops on both sides of the line and their devotion to ideals.  To be valuable, the study of a great historical event must be infused with meaning and Gramm helps the reader see how to go about this -- even if the reader disagrees with some of Gramm's conclusions and some of his partisanship.  While reading these essays, I was reminded of William James's essay \\"The Moral Equivalent of War\\" which explains what James saw in the American Civil War and the importance of transmitting some lessons of its study to everyday life in peacetime.  Gramm does not discuss James, but he uses heavily and well the works of Henry David Thoreau and Walt Whitman.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed Gramm's discussion of Confederate General Dorsey Pender, fatally wounded during the second day at Gettysburg, who, for Gramm, epitomizes many of the values to be learned from the conflict.  I also learned a great deal from Gramm's discussion of Pickett's charge and from his essays on the Union Iron Brigade during the first day of the battle.  Gramm evidences a particular fondness for the Iron Brigade which, like the First Minnesota, suffered on a heroic scale during the battle of Gettysburg.<br /><br />This is a book for the reader who knows something of the facts of the Battle of Gettysburg and wishes to join Gramm in the process of reflection and meditation.er who knows something of the facts of the Battle of Gettysburg and wishes to join Gramm in the process of reflection and meditation.  <br />	2004-11-02

The battle can be explored from innumerable perspectives and with a greater or lesser degree of depth depending upon the interests of the reader.<br /><br />David Martin's study, \\"Gettysburg, July 1\\" is a thorough, detailed study of the first day of the battle, of the events leading up to it, and of the impact of the first day's fight on the remainder of the contest.  The book examines day 1 of Gettysburg on the macro and micro levels.  Martin discusses the strategies of the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia after they stumbled into each other on July 1.  But in addition to command decisions, Martin gives great attention to the battle on the division and regimental levels.  He also painstakingly describes and analyzes many anecdotes, legends, and accounts of individual soldiers.  The detail may make it difficult for the reader to separate the important from the secondary, and it makes the account repetitious at times.<br /><br />Together with his account, Martin offers his own assessment of the course of the battle and of the decisions of the commanders.  At times he falls into speculation and into \\"what-ifs\\", but he is clear to indicate to the reader when he is doing so.  Martin is critical of the Union 11th Corps, of Union Generals Howard and Slocum, of Confederate commander Robert E. Lee and of Confederate Third Corps commander A.P. Hill.  He praises the Union First Corps and Generals Meade, Hancock,Reynolds Doubleday, and Buford.  His analyses flow well if slowly from his factual presentation.  Martin treats his subject with seriousness and respect.<br /><br />The reader would be well advised to begin this book with appendix 2 which is an outstanding account of the topography of the first day's battlefield and of the road network surrounding Gettysburg.  These factors are critical in understanding the events of July 1.  I also thought the maps in this book were highly useful in understanding the battle.  The maps are of two kinds: a \\"situation\\" map showing the position of the troops at a given point in time and an \\"action\\" map focusing on an incident of the battle -- for example Confederate General Iverson's ill-conceived attack on Baxter's troops early in the afternoon.<br /><br />Discussion of July 1 at Gettysburg almost always focuses on the Confederate's apparent failure to follow-up on their success and attack the heights -- Cemetery and Culp's Hills.  Martin does a masterful job of showing how the Confederate decision was in fact a sum of many small decisions.  I found his analysis helped me a great deal in sorting out and understanding this controversial issue.  Martin concludes that General Lee (not General Ewell, comander of the Confederate Second Corps) was responsible for the decision not to advance on the heights and the attack probably would have been unsuccessful if it had been attempted.<br /><br />As I indicated at the beginning of this review, there are many ways of approaching the Battle of Gettysburg and many levels of detail that may interest different readers. I suggest that this book can best be read by readers who have a good grounding in the Civil War and, more particularly, a good background in the battle of Gettysburg itself.  But because of the detail of this book, I suggest the reader also have examined something of the first day's actions before tackling this study.  I recommend Warren Hassler's shorter account of day 1 \\"Crisis at the Crossroads.\\"  Harry Pfanz's study of day 1 is also a detailed and lucid account, and shorter than Martin's book.<br /><br />This is a thorough account of day 1 at Getttysburg that will appeal to readers with a passion to learn everything they can about this important event in our Nation's history.he maps in this book were highly useful in understanding the battle.

But they rarely discuss the nature of the \\"long arm\\" itself -- how artillery functioned, how it was organized and used, and the circumstances which controlled its effectiveness.  The books seem either to presuppose such knowledge in the reader or to assume that the knowledge will be picked up through the general historical account.  When I started reading accounts of Gettysburg and other Civil War engagements in earnest, I was puzzled by many things but especially by discussions of artillery.<br /><br />Philip Cole is a Licensed Battlefield Guide at Gettysburg, and his book \\"Civil War Artillery at Gettysburg\\" presents an excellent introduction to the use of artillery in both the Union and Confederate armies.  The book is something of a hybrid.  Most of it focuses on the use of artillery througout the Civil War with no special reference to Gettysburg.  But Gettysburg gets its share of attention interlaced with and informed by the author's broader treatment of artillery.<br /><br />As to the artillery at Gettysburg, Mr. Cole's focus is on the cannonade the proceeded Pickett's charge on July 3, 1863.  The cannonade, and the Union response, is discussed well and from varied perspectives at each stage of Mr. Cole's treatment of the nature of artillery.  He has insightful things to say about the placement of the Confederate guns, the organization of the Army, the confusing nature of Confederate weaponry, the vagaries of Confederate ammunition, the terrain, the smoke produced by the guns, and a myriad of other details that went into the July 3 cannonande and the Army of the Potomac's response at Gettysburg.  I learned a great deal about Pickett's charge and the factors affecting the use of artillery from Mr. Cole's account.<br /><br />The book has less to say about other uses of artillery at Gettysburg.  This is unfortunate because artillery played, as Mr. Cole stresses, a vital role in both the first and second days of the battle, throughout the field.  Mr. Cole suggests that artillery was well and properly used by both sides during these earlier engagements; thus he devotes most of his space to Pickett's charge.  There is still much to be learned from a study of artillery earlier in the battle.  The reader wishing a study of artillery throughout the Battle of Gettysburg (but a book which lacks Mr. Cole's technical discussion) may wish to read Fairfax Downey's \\"The Guns of Gettysburg\\" (1958)<br /><br />As far as the treatment of Civil War artillery in general is concerned, Mr. Cole discusses the organization of the artillery arm of the service in each army.  He offers descriptions of the various weapons, smoothbores and rifles, the ranges, and advantages and disadvantages of each.  He discusses each type of shot and shell fired by the guns with a great deal of specialized technical detail.  The book discusses the organization of artillery units and the training of the soldiers for this difficult branch of the service.  He discusses horses, movement of the pieces, offensive and defensive tactics, the effect of weather and perhaps most basically of all -- smoke.<br /><br />There is a useful glossary and many helpful diagrams and photographs.<br /><br />Mr. Cole has written a specialized but useful study. The book is for readers who already have a thorough grounding in Civil War military history and a passion to explore it. The book will teach a great deal to readers fascinated by the Civil War and by the battle of Gettysburg.is unfortunate because artillery played, as Mr. Cole stresses, a vital role in both the first and second days of the battle, throughout the field.

This year, I had the good fortune to attend the 141st anniversary battle walks.  On the hot, humid morning of July 2, 2004, together with my companion and about 200 other people fascinated by the Battle of Gettysburg, I walked through the tall grass of the 20 acre Wheatfield, stood in line formation on the ridge cutting through the middle of the Wheatfield, climbed up and down Stony Hill, and stood at the stone walls separating the east and southeast portions of the Wheatfield from Rose's woods.  Throuhgout the walk, I had the benefit of an enthusiastic and informed presentation by Gettysburg Park Ranger Eric Campbell and the opportunity for fellowship and reflection.  The battle walk gave me the opportunity to know the Wheatfield first-hand.<br /><br />The battle walk also inspired me to read Jay Joregenson's recent book \\"Gettysburg's Bloody Wheatfield\\" which is devoted solely to an examination of events in this portion of the Battle of Gettysburg.  As are many who write about the Civil War, Jorgenson is an amateur historian.  His professional training and real-life job is as an attorney.  The book gets off to a bit of a slow start.  But after Jorgenson sets the stage, discusses the key actors, and explains how the troops found themselves fighting over the Wheatfield in the first place, the book picks up in power.  In succinct, spare and clear prose, Joregenson describes in detail the events of this confusing and almost rudderless fighting.  His account helped me reinforce and understand what I had seen for myself in the Wheatfield earlier in the year.  It is a worthy telling of the story.<br /><br />By way of brief summary, the action at the Wheatfield occured during the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg on the Union left -- Confederate right.  It was part of Confederate General Longstreet's furious attack on the Union position which commenced, after delay, at about 4:00 p.m.  Just before the assault, Union Third Corps General Dan Sickles had ignored orders from the Union Commander, George Meade, and moved his troops forward about 3/4 of a mile to occupy a position which included, loosely held, the Wheatfield.<br /><br />Longstreet's troops assaulted the position from three sides. Sickle's soldiers were reinforced by troops from the Union Fifth and Second Corps.  Due to the improvisatory, unplanned nature of the fighting and the several different units involved there was little clear leadership of the fighting forces for either the Union or the Confederate troops.  The battle seesawed back and forth for hours with great loss over the open plain of the Wheatfield and on the adjacent Stony Hill.  Finally, the Confederates were able to surround the position on three sides and force the Union troops back to the area of Little Round Top.  But this famous hill had been secured for the Union and the Confederates could make no futher headway.<br /><br />The fight for the Wheatfield was highly confusing and the casualties and carnage were appalling.  The Wheatfield was called \\"the Whirlpool\\" by the troops who fought over it.  Put another way, there were many other wheatfields which saw sustained combat, even at Gettysburg, and certainly throughout the Civil War.  But there is only one Wheatfield, and it was fought over desperately on the afternoon of July 2, 1863.<br /><br />The best way to understand the action at the Wheatfield is to visit the site.  For those that have done so, and for those that lack this opportunity, Jorgenson admirably tells its story and the story of the brave soldiers who fought there.he Union left -- Confederate right.

Following the battle, with the retreat of Lee's Army and the pursuit by Meade's, there was a pressing need to take care of the dead, wounded, and destroyed that the armies left in their wake.  There also was, and remains, a need to reflect upon the significance of the Battle and the lessons to be learned from it.<br /><br />Gregory Coco's book, \\"A Strange and Blighted Land\\" (1995) gives a comprehensive account of the aftermath of the Battle of Gettysburg.  Mr. Coco is a Park Ranger at Gettysburg, and he hasa written extensively and well about the battle.  He is also a Vietnam veteran.  His history in this book stresses eloquently,  the carnage of war, its terrors and pain, and its irreplaceable cost in human life and treasure.<br /><br />The book is arranged in five rather lengthy chapters. In the first chapter, Mr. Coco offers his readers a tour of the Battlefield in which he presents eyewitness accounts of the death and destruction evident over the 25 mile square Battlefield.  The second chapter discusses the dead of Gettysburg and their burials.  There is excellent historical material here about the establishment of the Gettysburg National Cemetery.  In his next chapter, Mr. Coco discusses the Gettysburg wounded, both North and South, the medical and surgical practices of the day, and the camps set up in haste to care for the masses of grievously wounded soldiers.  In his fourth chapter, Mr. Coco discusses the treatment of prisoners of war, and the fate of the many stragglers and deserters which followed in the wake of the battle.  In his final chapter, Mr. Coco discusses preservation efforts for the Battlefield, culminating in the establishment of the Gettysburg National Military Park in 1895.<br /><br />I have read several other accounts of the aftermath of Gettysburg. Mr. Coco's book is by far the most thorough.  He has the factual details at his command and presents them in a convincing manner.  He shows great familiarity with the Battle itself, and discusses well the controversies and issues in determining the numbers of the killed, wounded, and missing.<br /><br />But there is much more to this book than a factual recounting of the aftermath of a battle. The book is written in an appealing, personal, sometimes buttonholing style in which Mr. Coco seems to be at the readers side offering observations and commentary on the significance of the events set forth in his story. He offers opinions on a variety of topics emanating from his reflections on Gettysburg and on war.  (Specifically, Mr. Coco shows a healthy skepticism in matters of religion.) Mr. Coco focuses on the meaning to be drawn from Gettysburg and from our Civil War.  His own perspective is clear.  Mr. Coco is opposed to efforts to glorify or romanticize war.  Again and again, he stresses the horrors of war and tries to impress upon his readers that the greatest lesson to be learned from Gettysburg is -- to try to prevent such things from happening.  Thus his book concludes (p.373)<br /><br />\\"Let us now leave behind the aftermath story with this hope: that for each and every attempt to parade the 'pomp and circumstance' of war, we give equal time to the corrupt and merciless monster shielded smugly within, because, 'if the bugler starts to play, we too must dance.'\\"<br /><br />This book is both an excellent history and a deeply-felt attempt to think about the meaning of Gettysburg.s the factual details at his command and presents them in a convincing manner.

With Grant commanding the Army of the Tennessee, the Battle of Shiloh began on April 6, 1862 with a daring attack by the Confederate's Army of the Mississippi commanded by General Albert Sidney Johnston.  Johnston lost his life during the battle. On April 7, 1862, following reinforcement of Grant by the Army of the Cumberland, the Confederate forces were driven back.<br /><br />The Battle of Shiloh occurred in a remote area of Southwest Tennessee near Savannah, Tennessee and about 22 miles north of Corinth, Mississippi.  Congress provided for the establishment of a National Military Park at Shiloh in 1893. (The National Cemetery was established just after the Civil War.)  I visited the park four years ago.  It remains pristine and isolated and undeveloped. The park is arranged with quiet dignity.  I was moved by my visit.<br /><br />In his book \\"This Great Battlefield of Shiloh\\" Dr. Timothy Smith discusses the establisment and history of the Shiloh National Battlefield.  Dr Smith holds a PhD in history from Mississippi State and is a park ranger at Shiloh.  He is deeply familiar with the Battle, with the history of the Park, and with recent scholarly approaches discussing the relationship between memory and history in studying the Civil War.<br /><br />Dr. Smith begins his book with a brief overview of the Battle.  He then discusses how an organization composed of veterans and political leaders worked successfully for the establishment of the Park.  He explores in detail the work involved in establishing the Park, in the matters of clearing title, acquiring land, building roads, planning monuments and living quarters, determining the history of the Battle and much else. His stresses the reomote location of Shiloh and the lack of roads early in the 20th Century.  Most material needed to be shipped on the Tennessee River to the site of Pittsburgh Landing, a key feature of the Battlefield.  Many people devoted their lives to the establishment of the Shiloh Park.  Dr. Smith pays most attention to Cornelius Cadle, the first chairman of the commission which managed the park, Atwell Thompson, the park's chief engineer, and David Reed.  Reed was a historian whose account of the Battle of Shiloh set the stage for subsequent interpretations over the next 70 years.<br /><br />There is a great deal more to Dr. Smith's account than factual information. His book explores well the purposes for which the Park was established -- to promote American patriotism, reconciliation after the Civil War, and American nationalism.  In accordance with much recent scholarship, Dr. Smith is aware that these values were purchased at high cost -- the origins of the Civil War in slavery and in sucession were marginalized in an attempt to celebrate Union and the valor of Americans both North and South.  I found Dr. Smith's account measured and careful, both in the importance he attaches to the values for which the Park was established and in his realization of the tragedy of forgetting the origins of the War.<br /><br />Dr Smith also has interesting things to say about the Battle of Shiloh itself and of the history that David Reed and the Park perpetuated.  Reed saw the Sunken Road and Hornet's Nest in the middle of the Battlefield as the key to the fighting.  Many subsequent historians have followed that view.  But, according to Dr Smith, more detailed research has shown that the Sunken Road saw only limited action with most of the fighting taking place to its East or West.  This is a point that needs developing and analysis in subsequent studies of the battle.<br /><br />Among the more romantic elements of the Battle of Shiloh is the death of General Albert Sidney Johnston, the highest-ranked American officer to be killed in Battle.  Dr. Smith gives an excellent account of how the Park determined the spot where Johnston fell and how it was marked on the Battlefield. Johnston's actual location at his death too remains a subject of dispute.<br /><br />This is a fine book particulary in the way Dr. Smith discusses the meaning of the Battle and the War and encourages reflection on these matters by his readers.  I wanted to visit Shiloh again after reading the book.  The book will interest readers interested in Shiloh and in Civil War historiography.cellent account of how the Park determined the spot where Johnston fell and how it was marked on the Battlefield.

US	48185764	R2UV8GP996XFXA	0807847534	128517052	The Third Day at Gettysburg and Beyond (Military Campaigns of the Civil War)	Books	4	4	5	N	Y	Studies of the Third Day of Gettysburg	This book is the final volume of essays on each of the three days of the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1 --3, 1863) edited by Professor Gary Gallagher.  It includes six essays  five of which center upon the final assault on the center of the Union position on Cemetery Ridge on July 3, commonly known as &#34;Pickett's Charge.&#34;  Although I found the essays illuminating, they do not address the legendary charge itself but deal instead with somewhat collateral issues.  Four of these five essays deal predominantly with the Southern assault rather than with the Union defense.  The final essay in the volume explores in detail the Confederate retreat following the battle and the Union pursuit.<br /><br />The book opens with an essay by Professor Gallagher, &#34;Lee's Army has not Lost any of its Prestige&#34;. This essay challenges the view that Gettysburg was recognized as a disaster for the Confederacy in the immediate aftermath of the battle.  Professor Gallagher argues that the morale of the Southern Army remained high and that the Southern press and people were not of one mind in their reaction to the Battle.  There is valuable material in this essay, but even in Professor Gallagher's recounting the evidence of Southern reaction is equivocal.  Although the material is interesting, I found it of secondary value in trying to understand the events of July 3.<br /><br />William Garrett Piston's essay &#34;Longstreet, Lee, and Confederate Attack Plans for July 3 at Gettysburg&#34; is an outstanding study of the Lee-Longstreet controversy as it applied to the formulation of plans for the third day of the Battle.  Piston reviews in detail the various plans of General Lee and General Longstreet for the third day of the Battle.  He argues persuasively that Longstreet was dilatory and did not follow Lee's orders to attack early in the day on July 3.  (Most of Longstreet's critics focus with much less justification on Longstreet's alleged slowness on July 2.)  The essay explores the options available to the Army of Northern Virginia on the morning of the third day of the battle.  The Southern position was very difficult, in hindsight, and the performance of both Lee and Longsteet was wanting.  This is easily the best essay in the volume in terms of understanding the events of July 3.<br /><br />Carol Reardon's essay &#34;The Convergence of History and Myth in the Southern Past&#34; is one of an increasing number of scholarly efforts to distinguish between history as an actual event and history as memory  -- the uses and mythologies which people construct about the past.  She discusses how Pickett's charge assumed the status of a legend and she focuses on the war after the Battle in the South.  This war over the charge involved attempts to exonerate Robert E. Lee for the failure of the assault, and it also involved disputes between Virginians and North Carolinians over which Southern troops deserved the glory (and which the blame) for the assault.  Professor Reardon subsequently addressed the subject of this essay in her book &#34;Pickett's Charge in History and Memory.&#34;<br /><br />Robert Krick's essay &#34;Armistead and Garnett: the parallel lives of two Virginia soldiers&#34; offers biographical insights into the two of General Pickett's brigade commanders who died at Gettysburg.  I learned a great deal about Armistead and Garnett from this essay, but it was of limited usefulness in helping me understand Pickett's charge.<br /><br />Anthropologist Robert Bee's essay &#34;Fredricksburg on the Other Leg&#34; examines the letters of a Union combatant, Sergeant Ben Hirst, of the 14th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry, who participated on the Union side of the line during Pickett's charge.  This is a good essay in how a common soldier saw and responded to the Confederate assault.<br /><br />The final essay in the volume &#34;From Gettysburg to Falling Waters&#34; by A Wilson Greene examines two issues: a) General Meade's decision not to counterattack on July 3 and July 4 following the repulse of Pickett's charge; b) the retreat from Gettysburg and General Meade's alleged failure to pursue with sufficient aggressiveness before the Southern Army crossed the Potomac to Virginia on July 14.  The essay includes a careful factual exposition followed by Greene's analysis.  Greene argues that Meade acted properly in deciding against a counterattack.  The matter of the retreat is more complex.  President Lincoln's views, highly critical of Meade, have colored much of the controversy and tarnished Meade's reputation.  Greene finds that Meade on the whole performed ably and thoughtfully in his pursuit of the retreating Army of Northern Virginia.  He concludes, however, that the Union Army had opportunities for a more aggressive approach which a more daring and imaginative commander could well have exploited to good effect.  It is doubtful that Lee's army could have been destroyed by more aggressive pursuit.<br /><br />This is a thougtful volume of essays that will interest readers familiar with the basic facts and issues of the Gettysburg campaign.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanerattack on July 3 and July 4 following the repulse of Pickett's charge; b) the retreat from Gettysburg and General Meade's alleged failure to pursue with sufficient aggressiveness before the Southern Army crossed the Potomac to Virginia on July 14.

The first group consists of those with an interest in military history, in the story of the great battles, campaigns, leaders, and strategies of the war. This group includes, among others, visitors to battlefields, reenactors and, (to use a patronizing term I dislike), Civil War \\"buffs\\".  The second group consists of people who are interested in the causes of the war, its meaning and significance, its aftermath, and the way Americans have viewed it over the years to shape their understanding of themselves. This second group frequently finds the interest of the first group somewhat out of focus in considering the war.<br /><br />There is, in fact, no need for this sharp division in the two groups.  The Civil War was the defining moment in our history and can be studied with benefit from many perspectives.  David Blight's book of essays \\"Beyond the Battlefield: Race, Memory and the American Civil War\\" (2002) acknowledges (preface, p. x) that there is ample room for both military and social-political study in approaching the war.  His approach, however, veers sharply towards the latter. Professor Blight offers an important and necessary study of the ideas and meaning of the war, but even in its own terms it may not be the exclusive way of considering ideas and meaning.<br /><br />Professor Blight is interested in how Americans have viewed the Civil War over the years.  Broadly speaking, he argues that Americans became preoccupied with restoring national unity and reconciliation between the North and South following the conclusion of the War.  Both sides thus ignored the role of ideas in the war.  They tended to downplay the sources of the war in the institution of slavery and, following the war, allowed the creation of a Jim Crow, racist society which continued to deny rights to black Americans.  Peace and sectional reconciliation thus were achieved at the cost of the rights of black Americans and of ignoring the ideals for which the war was fought.  Thus Professor Blight's essays in this volume amplify ideas he expressed well in his earlier book: \\"Race and Reunion: the Civil War in American Memory.\\"<br /><br />In his preface, Professor Blight states that the essays are informed by three broad themes: 1. the meaning, cause, and consequences of the Civil War 2.the nature of African-American history and the significance of race in American history; and 3.the character and purpose of a study of historical memory.  Of these themes, the third is rather abstract, and Professor Blight never fully explains what he means. Put simply, I think people tend to use the past for their own purposes.  But relativism and myth-making are endemic to all forms of historical study, and Professor Blight seems, correctly in my view, to insist that we can learn something about the past separate from our own preoccupations and prejudices.  In other words, the first and second themes of his book are more compelling and better stated than the third theme.<br /><br />The first section of the book focuses on the origin of the Civil War in slavery.  It includes illuminating discussions of the work of Frederick Douglass, consideration of the many slave narratives that appeared before the war, and discussions on the interactions that Douglass had with President Lincoln. There is also an interesting essay on the way in which one Union soldier's ideas on the war and its causes evolved during his three years of military service. These essays are insightful in showing how slavery ultimately was the source of the conflict.<br /><br />The second group of essays studies the way Americans tended to sentimentalize the war after its conclusion by forgetting its ideological underpinnings and its origin in slavery. Professor Blight very correctly wants Americans to reconsider the origins of the war, to remember the fight over slavery, and to recommit themselves to the goal of human freedom and equality. There are further essays about Frederick Douglass, about the Shaw memorial (commemorating the attack by black troops of Fort Wagner, South Carolina), on the history of the Emancipation Proclamation, and on veterans reunions, particularly at Gettysburg in 1913.  What Professor Blight has to teach is extremely important and well-presented.  I am not sure that he gives full weight to the difficulties the country faced at the conclusion of the war and of the struggles that might have continued to rend the country without reconciliation efforts.  It was truly a difficult situation for our country, and the consequences were not happy.<br /><br />The final section of the book includes discussions of Ken Burns's television history, an excellent essay on W.E.B. DuBois, and an essay on the late Professor Nathan Irvin Huggins whose works influenced Professor Blight's.<br /><br />I enjoyed the allusiveness and the love of learning that Professor Blight shows in these essays.  He discusses and uses well writers such as Douglass, DuBois, Walt Whitman, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Nietzsche, James Weldon Johnson, and many others.  The erudition of the book makes it a pleasure to read.<br /><br />I also found the book valuable in getting the reader to focus on the causes and consequences of the Civil War, including the focus on slavery and Reconstruction.  There has been, and still is, a tendency for some people to forget their centrality to the war.  But the importance of a reunited nation should not be discounted entirely. Nor should Americans forget the valor and sacrifices made on the Battlefields to forge our national character and to enable Americans of subsequent generations to discover and expand the ideals of our Nation and to rededicate themselves to the realization of these ideals.  There is need for Americans to understand both the need for justice and for the end of racism and also the need following the war for reconciliation and for a united people.  The goals are (and should have been) complimentary and not exclusive. I think this latter point tends to be downplayed in Professor Blight's otherwise excellent essays.quality.

The novel tells the story of Edgar Drake, a London piano tuner who, out of the blue, in 1886 is commissioned to tune an expensive Erhard grand piano in a remote outpost of Burma which had been requested by the outpost commander, Anthony Carroll, a physician and lover of music.  Drake leads a quiet life and has been happily but childlessly married for many years to a woman named Katherine. The book is set against the backdrop of British imperialism and ongoing wars between Britian, France, Russia and the local Burmese.<br /><br />The first half of the book moves slowly.  It covers Drake's commission and his difficult voyage from London to his destination in Burma, Mae Lwin.  The second part of the book describes Drake's efforts to tune the piano, his relationship with Dr. Carroll, and with a beautiful exotic Burmese woman, Khin Myo.  There are twists and surprises at the end as the love of music and the depictions of the beauties of Burma become intertwined with harsh and ambiguous political and military affairs.<br /><br />The novel is told with many insets from strange characters, such as \\"The Man with One Story\\" early in the novel, and through letters and dreams.  Some of these insets are evocative in themselves but add little to the story and tend to slow down the work.<br /><br />There is some excellent descriptive writing in the book.  The parts I most enjoyed included the careful descriptions of the process of tuning a piano in the middle of the jungle. The piano tuner distinguishes between the initial tuning of the instrument, followed by the fine tuning to put the instrument in the best condition for serious playing. (I find this distinction valuable in my response to the book.)  I also enjoyed the passages praising the love of music, learning, and culture, whether Western or Eastern, and a fine scene where Drake, who professes to have little skill at playing the piano, plays by memory most of the first book of Bach's \\"Well-Tempered Clavier\\".<br /><br />There are some graphic scenes of the book, including an amputation, a description of death by snakebite, and Drake's bout with malaria.<br /><br />As the novel moves on, the reader sees Drake becoming progressively more attached to Burma and its people and coming to a new understanding of himself in a distant land.<br /><br />The story is lushly told and gave me a good feeling for Drake's quest (something of an \\"Odessey\\" in reverse) and growing efforts at self-realization.  The book moves too slowly at times, the parts do not entirely fit together, and some of the basic premisies of the plot, I find, were not fully explained.  With its love of music, piano, and human self-awareness, this book is an outstanding initial effort by its young author.  As does a quality piano, however, it could have used fine tuning.o professes to have little skill at playing the piano, plays by memory most of the first book of Bach's \\"Well-Tempered Clavier\\". <br />There are some graphic scenes of the book, including an amputation, a description of death by snakebite, and Drake's bout with malaria. <br /> <br />As the novel moves on, the reader sees Drake becoming progressively more attached to Burma and its people and coming to a new understanding of himself in a distant land. <br /> <br />The story is lushly told and gave me a good feeling for Drake's quest (something of an \\"Odessey\\" in reverse) and growing efforts at self-realization.

Mississippi tried to \\"comply\\" with the law by a \\"Freedom of Choice\\" program which allowed students over a certain age and parents to designate the schools they wished to attend.  While, perhaps, facially appealing, the \\"Freedom of Choice\\" program served as a means to intimidate blacks from attempting to register in what were at the time all-white schools. Those with the courage to do so faced danger to their livelihood, property, and persons.  The \\"Freedom of Choice\\" program ultimately was invalidated through litigation.<br /><br />Constance Curry's inspiring book \\"Silver Rights\\" (1995) tells the story of a family of black sharecroppers in the heart of the Mississippi Delta, Mae Bertha and Matthew Carter and seven of their thirteen children (all their children then of school age).  The Carter's took the \\"Freedom of Choice\\" program at its word.  In 1965, the seven children enrolled in the primary and secondary schools of Drew, Mississippi, a small town with a then-deserved reputation for violence and lawlessness. Ms. Curry worked as a field representative for the American Friends Service Committee from 1965-1975.  She got to know the Carter family well and was instrumental in providing the assistance necessary to get them through their difficult times.<br /><br />The book includes excellent pictures of life in the Mississippi Delta, for both white and black people, in the early to mid-twentieth century. The book shows a feel for the place, for sharecropping life on the farms and for life in the dusty towns, for the blues culture of the Delta, and for its history. The book offers substantial discussion of the notorious Emmett Till case and of other lynchings and of early attempts to organize civil rights activities in the Delta.  Ms. Curry eloquently evokes the spirit of the Delta at the opening of her story:<br /><br />\\"In trying to describe the Mississippi Delta, I seem to find only superlatives -- the flattest land, the blackest dirt, the hottest summers, the nicest people, the poorest people.  In defining the delta's past and even its present, I am aware of these extremes and also of its incongruities: the violence and the peacefulness, the beauty and the ugliness, the stillness and the tension.  It is a place complex almost beyond comprehension.\\" (p. xxi)<br /><br />In telling her story, Ms. Curry lets her protagonists do most of the talking.  The opening chapters set the stage and explain the Carter's ambitions for an education, and an end to the hardships of sharecropping, for their children.  The second section of the book explores the backround of Mae Bertha Carter and her mother Luvenia's early life as the wife of a Delta sharecropper.  The book discusses throughout the experiences of the Carter family as they faced violence and shootings in the early stages following their enrollment in the formerly white schools.  Throughout their period in the public schools the children endured harassment, name-calling and ostracism. The Carter family was forced off the plantation and Matthew Carter lost his job.  The book shows the courage and perseverance of the family and the aid offered by the AFSC and other organizations.<br /><br />The book includes interviews with each of the thirteen Carter children and discussions of the family members fared after their graduation from the public schools.  There are some moving scenes when Ms. Curry reestablished contact  with the Carter family in 1988, thirteen years after her work with the AFSC came to an end. Mae Bertha Carter remains determined and forceful and has received honors from institutions within the State of Mississippi that would have been unthinkable in the 1960s.<br /><br />This book tells an important story of the silver rights movement.

The Union commander, General George Meade, arrived at Gettysburg late in the evening and walked the length of Cemetery Ridge, which together with the heights became the Union position. He placed the second corps of the Union Army adjacent to Cemetery Hill heading southward on Cemetery Ridge and ordered the Third Corps, commanded by General Dan Sickles, to place itself on the Second Corps' left and extend the line to the hill now famous as Little Round Top.<br /><br />General Sickles was the only non-professional Corps commander in the Army.  Rather than acting in accordance with the intent of General Meade Sickles moved his Third Corps about 3/4 mile in front of the line General Meade intended for him.  Sickles's line had its focus at the Peach Orchard and left Little Round Top uncovered.  Sickles's line was well in front of and isolated from the main Union force.  At 4:00 the Confederate First Corps under Longstreet attacked Sickles with great fury.  Meade sent reinforcements.  The Third Corps line was destroyed. The Union position on Cemetery Ridge waivered but survived intact.<br /><br />The controversy that the above events provoked between Generals Meade and Sickles, their supporters, and generations of historians is the subject of Richard Sauers's study \\"Gettysburg: The Meade-Sickles Controversy\\" (2003).  Sauers is a military historian and his written extensively on the Civil War.  This book appears to be the first that focuses exclusively on the Meade-Sickles controversy and its aftermath.<br /><br />Sauers shows an excellent grasp of the Battle of Gettysburg and presents a summary of the events of the first and second days of the Battle in his opening chapters, focusing on Sickles's move to the Peach Orchard line.<br /><br />The third chapter of the book describes Congressional hearings and contemporaneus newspaper disputes in which Sickles and politically-motivated members of Congress and Union leaders tried to blame General Meade for his conduct at Gettysburg and to cast Sickles and his Peach Orchard salient as the saviour of the Battle.<br /><br />The book continues in chapter 4 with further efforts by Sickles to defend his actions subsequent to the death of General Meade in 1872.  Chapter 5 of the book was for me the most fascinating.  Sauers presents a history of the history of Gettysburg.  He describes how each major historian of the Battle treated the Meade-Sickles controversy on day 2 of Gettysburg and the reasoning on which each historian relied.  The remainder of the book consists of Sauers's own examination and resolution of the issues at stake in the controversy.<br /><br />Sickles offered four justifications for moving forward with his line on July 2: 1.General Meade had not given him orders (or at least not clear orders). 2.  The position on Cemetery Ridge was on low ground.  It was controlled by the Peach Orchard and, in any event, Meade's line was too long to be defended. 3. Sickles's advance prevented Meade from following-through on his plan to retreat from Gettysburg before the battle even began. 4. Sickles had located movements to the Federal left by the Confederates under Longstreet and moved his Corps to counter the threat.<br /><br />In each of the four final chapters of the book, Sauers carefully examines and rejects each of these assertions.  He finds that Meade had given clear orders, that the Cemetery Ridge position Meade assigned to Sickles was defensible, that there was no plan to retreat, and that Sickles had not early in the day located a movement by Longstreet's troops.  He declines to speculate on what might or would have happened if the Third Corps had remained on Cemetery Ridge.<br /><br />Sauers offers a careful and thoughtful account of the controversy which goes far in restoring, to the extent disagreements remain, General Meade's reputation for his conduct of the Battle of Gettysburg.  But one of the fascinations of history and of the study of important events is that questions remain.  There are still knowledgeable scholars somewhat sympathetic to Sickles.  For example William Glen Robertson's essay \\"The Peach Orchard Revisited: Daniel E. Sickles and the Third Corps on July 2, 1863\\", accepts much of the critique and analysis that Sauers offers. But Robertson argues that Sickles may have succeeded in spite of himself by advancing the Union line, serving as a \\"break-water\\" for the Confederate attack on the Cemetery Ridge position, and , possibly, saving Little Round Top from capture.  This conclusion to be sure involves a degree of speculation but it cannot be dismissed entirely in considering the effect of Sickles's move.  Robertson's essay is reprinted in \\"The Second Day at Gettysburg:Essays on Confederate and Union Leadership\\" edited by Gary W. Gallagher.<br /><br />Sauers's book will interest those readers who have a basic familiarity with the Battle of Gettysburg and want to explore in depth a major issue involving the Battle.  On a broader level, Sauers's book is an excellent study of the practice of history and of the difficulty in arriving at a historical understanding of a weighty and controversial event.to the extent disagreements remain, General Meade's reputation for his conduct of the Battle of Gettysburg.

These books have the overall goal of explaining Lincoln's Presidency, the meaning and significance of the Civil War, and the continued impact of the issues raised in this conflict upon today's United States.  These books include Gary Wills's study of the Gettysburg Address,  the books by John Corry and Harold Holzer on Lincoln's Cooper Union speech, Allen Guelzo's study of the Emancipation Proclmation, and, the book I will discuss here, \\"Lincoln's Greatest Speech: The Second Inaugural\\" (2002) by Ronald C. White, Jr.<br /><br />Ronald White is a professor of American Religous History at the San Francisco Theological Seminary.  Given his background as a scholar of religion, it is unsurprising that Professor White focuses on President Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address and on the religious vision he finds Lincoln set forth in that great speech.<br /><br />The book begins with a chapter setting the stage on the cold and rainy March 4, 1865, in Washington D.C. when Lincoln delivered his brief 703-word address.  Union arms were close to victory, and the large audience undoubtedly expected a paean to the might of the Union Army together with tones of triumph.<br /><br />President Lincoln delivered a speech entirely different.  In short compass, he delivered a meditiation on the origin of the War, its cost in human life, its origin in the institution of slavery, a call to forbearance and charity, and, most importantly for Professor White, a religious understanding of the meaning of the War.<br /><br />Professor White explores the speech on a paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line basis.  He discusses closely the words of Lincoln's text, and he places the text in context of events in the War and of mid-19th Century America.  He offers illuminating insights on the Second Inaugural by discussing a short letter Lincoln wrote on April 4, 1864, to the Governor of Kentucky in which Lincoln explained his reasons for issuing the Emancipation Proclmation. He also relies heavily on a short passage of jottings Lincoln prepared for himself in September, 1862, captioned \\"Meditation on the Divine Will.\\"<br /><br />The Second Inaugural as Professor White expounds it sets forth a complex religous message. The War, as Professor White reads Lincoln, was the will of a living and ethical God and was a recompense for the sin of slavery. This sin was nation-wide in scope and could not be imputed only to the rebelling Confederates. During the course of the conflict, Lincoln had moved from the agnosticism and determinism of his youth to a concept of a personal God.  His God was nondenominational and nontribal rather that the God of any particular creed (Lincoln never joined a church) or of factions, including the North or the South.  The scourge of slavery had brought on the War, but the end of the War opened the opportunity for forgiveness, reconciliation, and justice, \\"with malice toward none,with charity for all; with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right.\\"<br /><br />It is an impressive and theologically-complex vision.  Professor White writes with a purpose of encouraging meditation among his readers on the role of religion (not denominationalism) in our public life and on the continuing sruggle in our country to eliminate the vestiges of slavery and racism. He writes (p. 202):<br /><br />\\"The Lincoln that is available to us comes with no simple answers.  The chasm of race, which undergirded the legal structure of slavery, continues even though the Civil Rights movement, a hundred years after the Civil War, spearheaded political and legal action intended to right ancient wrongs.  Martin Luther King, Jr. chose to speak with the imposing statue of Lincoln as the background when he offered his dream for America.\\"<br /><br />Those readers interested in exploring further the complicated question of Lincoln's philosophical and religous beliefsmay wish to read Allen Guelzo's biography \\"Redeemer President\\" together with his more recent study of the Emancipation Proclamation.religous beliefs may wish to read Allen Guelzo's biography \\"Redeemer President\\" together with his more recent study of the Emancipation Proclamation. <br /> <br />	2004-08-23
US	48185764	R3QO0S803YIJQ1	0873384571	583716354	The First Day at Gettysburg: Essays on Confederate and Union Leadership	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Studies of the First Day at Gettysburg	The Battle of Gettysburg, (July 1 --July 3, 1863) is widely regarded as the pivotal battle of the Civil War and as one of the defining moment of our country's history.  The battle ended Robert E. Lee's second invasion of Union soil and put the Confederacy in a defensive posture from which it never recovered.<br /><br />\\"The First Day at Gettysburg\\" is the first of three collections of essays edited by Professor Gary Gallagher devoted to the three days of the battle.  It consists of four detailed and lengthy studies examining critical leadership decisions on both sides of the line. On the first day of the Battle, portions of the Union and Confederate armies collided north and west of Gettysburg.  The fighting continued for most of the day.  At the close of the day Union troops from the First and Eleventh Corps were pushed back through Gettysburg onto the heights of Cemetery and Culp's Hill northeast of Gettysburg. The Confederate command did not attempt, at the close of the first day, to take these heights, a decision that will be forever debated. Thus, ironically, the Confederate Army won a victory on day 1 at the cost of pushing the Union Army to an overwhelmingly strong position.  This is the stuff of the discussion of the events of July 1.<br /><br />Thie first essay in this volume \\"R.E. Lee and July 1 at Gettysburg\\" is by Alan T. Nolan.  Most of Nolan's work is critical of Robert E. Lee, and this essay is no exception.  The essay argues that Lee erred fundamentally, after the Battle of Chancellorsville, by invading the North at all. Thus, for Nolan, there should have been no Battle of Gettysburg.  He argues that any likely benefits of the invasion were not worth the risk to the Army of Northern Virginia and to the loss of manpower.  Nolan also criticizes General Lee's role in allowing \\"Jeb\\" Stuart to ride around the Union Army and for failing to exert sufficient control over his Corps commanders, particularly General A.P. Hill on July 1.<br /><br />The second essay \\"Confederate Corps Leadership on the First Day of Gettysburg: A.P. Hill and Richard S. Ewell in a Difficult Debut\\" is by Professor Gallagher himself. This is a good follow-up essay to Nolan's study. As Gallagher emphasizes, Generals Hill and Ewell were new to Corps command.  They received this responsiblity following Lee's reorganization of the Army after the death of Stonewall Jackson.  Both Hill and Ewell have been criticized for their conduct on the first day.  Hill has been criticized for rashly bringing on the Battle and for failing to follow-through at the conclusion of day 1.  Ewell has been criticized for his failure to attempt to take the heights -- Cemetery and Culp's Hills -- following the defeat of the Union Army.  Gallagher offers a balanced account of the actions of the two Confederate Corps commanders during the first day together with an account of the command decisions of General Lee. He argues that both Hill and Ewell performed adequately, but not with any special distinction, and that responsiblity for Confederate military decisions on July 1 ultimately rested with Lee as the commanding general.<br /><br />A. Wilson Greene's essay \\"From Chancellorsville to Cemetery Hill: O.O. Howard and Eleventh Corps Leadership\\" is the only essay in this volume that focuses on leadership.  The Union 11th Corps and its commander, General Oliver Howard, have been much criticized for their role on July 1.  As does Gallagher's essay on Hill and Ewell, Greene's essay attempts to rehabilitate the 11th Corps, its commanders, and General Howard. Greene offers an account of the disaster that befell the 11th Corps at Chancellorsville and emphasizes how that Corps was determined to redeem itself at Gettysburg.  He argues that the Corps fought bravely on July 1 and was instrumental in the Union goal of delaying the Confederate attack to allow the concentration of the Union Army and the occupation of the heights.  Although he is critical of certain decisions that GeneralHoward made in placing the Eleventh Corps, and the First Corps as well, Greene argues that Howard's approach to the action on July 1 was sound and saved the day for the Federals.  He also credits, as did Congress, General Howard with earmarking Cemetery and Culp's Hills for the anchor of the Union position.<br /><br />The final essay in this volume \\"Three Confederate Disasters on Oak Ridge; Failures of Brigade Leadership on the First Day of Gettysburg\\" by Robert S. Krick, offers a more straightforward description of events on the Battlefield than do the three companion essays.  Krick explains how and why three Confederate brigades came to grief on July 1 amidst the Confederate victory.  He also explains the consequences of these failures on the subsequent course of the Battle. Only two of the three disasters Krick discusses occured on Oak Hill.  The first disaster, involving the Brigade of Confederate General Joseph Davis occured in the fabled railroad cut at Gettysburg in the morning fighting.  Krick does a good job in explaining what happened, the consequences, and how the loss could have been averted.  The two disasters on Oak Hill during the afternoon of July 1 involved the brigades of Colonel Edward O'Neal and General Alfred Iverson under the command of Major General Rodes of Ewell's Corps.  Iverson's and O'Neal's attacks constituted two of the poorest led actions of any during the Civil War resulting in needless loss of life.  The result was that Rodes took Oak Hill, the linchpin of Confederate success on July 1, but at an exorbitant cost in casualties that would haunt the Southern Army for the remainder of the Battle of Gettysburg.<br /><br />This book does an outstanding job in setting forth many of the controversies surrounding the Battle of Gettysburg.  The essays will give the reader a good idea of the fascination this struggle continues to exert.  The book will be of most interest to those students who already have a good basic understanding of the events of the Battle.General Howard made in placing the Eleventh Corps, and the First Corps as well, Greene argues that Howard's approach to the action on July 1 was sound and saved the day for the Federals.

US	48185764	R3FBT4X59N4SMG	0807104752	186002352	The Life of Johnny Reb: The Common Soldier of the Confederacy	Books	4	17	18	N	N	A Pioneering Study of the Confederate Soldier	Bell Irvin Wiley (1906-1990), a scholar of the American Civil War, is best known for his two early books describing the lives of common soldiers in the Union and Confederate Armies.  His book, \\"The Life of Johnny Reb\\" appeared in 1943 and was followed in 1952 by its companion volume \\"The Life of Billy Yank\\".  At the beginning of his career, Wiley tended to concentrate on the Confederate War effort and wrote his book on \\"Billy Yank\\" as a result of the fascination he developed from writing his initial work with the common soldier.  Ironically, Wiley's book on \\"Billy Yank\\" is the stronger of the two in terms of detail, organization, factual material, and analysis.  His book on the Confederate soldier remains an important effort, essential to understanding the Southern Civil War experience.<br /><br />In the Preface to his book, Wiley points out the fascination that the campaigns and personalities of Lee, Jackson, Stuart, and other Southern leaders exert (and continue to exert) on students of the Civil War.  He aimed in his book to discuss the life of the soldier \\"as it really was\\" including among much else \\"how the hungry private fried his bacon, baked his biscuit, smoked his pipe\\".  His book succeeds in that aim. Wiley's book gave me a good picture of life in the Southern Army with all its privations and hardships.  He does not romanticize his subject or, for all his affection for the Southern soldier, fall prey to \\"Lost Cause\\" mythology.<br /><br />The book opens with a discussion of the enthusiasm of the Southern soldier during the early stages of the War -- largely resulting from the conviction that the War would be short and that the Yankees would go home.  He discusses how the dream of a short, decisive conflict quickly faded and how the troops were left with the dangerous, boring, and dehabilitating business of soldiering.  Some men continued througout with their convictions and enthusiasm but for most the War became something that could not end soon enough.<br /><br />Wiley gives good pictures and stories of the tedium of life in the camps during the winter and during the long periods when the armies were not in combat or on the march.  He describes the bad food, shoddy clothes, and low pay that were the lot of the Confederate soldier.  He discusses the various ways the troops spent their time. ranging from the sins of gambling, drink, and vice to the repeated attempts at religious revivials. Wiley is sensitive to the instances of cowardice and fear in the Confederate war effort but he rightly praises the valor and courage, overall, of the Confederate soldier.  They fought tenaciously and hard. Wiley discusses  the loneliness of soldier life as the men in the lines went to great efforts to write letters home and thought of their wives and sweethearts.<br /><br />I thought Wiley's discussion of the unsanitary conditions of the camps and the toll taken by disease and poor medical treatment among the best sections of the book.  He also discusses well the ambivalent relationships that frequently developed between Johnny Reb and his enemy in blue.  Although it became a total and brutal combat, the Civil War was marked by attempts at fraternization, and what later writers have termed the \\"brotherhood of men at arms.\\"  The feelings the combatants developed for each other became important in the reconciliation efforts following this devastating conflict.  Wiley also offers a good discussion of the various types of shoulder arms used by the Southern troops during the war, their manufacture, and their limitations.<br /><br />There is a great deal of anecdotal material in this book.  The text is repetitive at times.  But this book and its companion volume remain essential Civil War reading and will give the student a feel for life in the lines.<br /> <br />Wiley gives good pictures and stories of the tedium of life in the camps during the winter and during the long periods when the armies were not in combat or on the march.

Freeman's (1886-1953) \\"Lee's Lieutenant's: A Study in Command, vol. 3 (first published in 1944 but available in an excellent new edition) is the final volume of his great study of the Army of Northern Virginia.  It covers the Army from the Gettysburg Campaign, (June -- July, 1863) through the surrender at Appomatox in April, 1865.<br /><br />This book is lengthy, (over 700 pages plus appendices) and I initially planned to read only the opening material on Gettysburg (about the first 200 pages) in which I have a special interest. I became fascinated with Freeman's writing and with his approach to the subject and had to finish the volume.<br /><br />This book complements Freeman's earlier biography of Robert E. Lee, but its focus is on Lee's subordinates.  Thus the long section on Gettysburg which opens the book considers in detail the actions and motivations of \\"Jeb\\" Stuart, Richard Ewell, and James Longstreet, three of Lee's chief Lieutenants. (A.P. Hill at Gettysburg gets less attention.)  I had read materials critical of Freeman's account of Gettysburg before turning to his own writing. Even accepting much of the criticism, I was moved by Freeman's account of the Battle and I think I learned a great deal.  Freeman is indeed critical of Longstreet but, in this late work, is much more measured and balanced than I had anticipated.<br /><br />The book continues with excellent treatments of the War in the Eaastern theater following Gettysburg.  Freeman offers eloquent and judicious comments on the importance of this Battle to the Confederate cause.  He treats well the Mine Run campaign in the winter of 1863 and the campaign from the Wilderness to Appomatox under General Grant which doomed the Confederacy. Freeman also examines the detachment of James Longstreet's Corps from the Army of Northern Virgina following Gettysburg, and he is critical of Longstreet's leadership while serving in Tennessee.<br /><br />One of the most important sections of this book is the introduction.  In it Freeman gives a statement of his conclusions about the War and about the lessons he believes should be drawn from his study.  There is also an excellent biographical prelude covering briefly each of the chief actors in Freeman's story.  I found it useful to read the introduction first and return to it upon completing the book to focus on points Freeman was trying to make.<br /><br />In addition to the treatment of Gettysburg,  I found Freeman's treatment of the death of \\"Jeb\\" Stuart and his story of the final retreat to Appomatox particularly moving and well done.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Freeman emphasises the toll combat took on the officer Corps of the Army.  Stonewall Jackson's death at Chancellorsville was only the most severe blow to the leadership pool available to the Army.  At Gettysburg and throughout the Wilderness Campaign beginning in 1864, the Confederacy lost heavily in gifted and able leaders that it could not adequately replace.  The loss of command material, Freeman maintains, was a critical factor in the Confederate defeat.<br /><br />The book is told almost entirely from the Confederate side of the line with little detailed consideration of the actions of the Union Army.  Freeman obviously had a deep devotion to the South and to its cause in the Civil War.  His book is still much more a work of history than of apologetics.  His judgments of commanders and battles are fair and well stated.

The title of this book, \\"South of No North: Stories of the Buried Life\\" (1975) captures hauntingly the sense of loneliness, alienation, and aloneness that underlies the 27 short stories in this volume.<br /><br />Bukowski began writing short stories at an early age while he  supported himself doing odd jobs and through work at the Post Office.  He then turned to poetry and, eventually, to writing novels at the urging of John Martin of Black Sparrow Press.  Bukowski continued to write stories and columns for underground newspapers in Los Angeles.  Some of the stories are included here.<br /><br />As are the novels, Bukowski's stories are raw and gritty.  They are filled with life in Los Angeles flophouses and cheap rooming houses.  The stories feature chronic alcoholism, crude sexuality, sexual frustration, horseplaying, violence, and joblessness.  They are a chronicle of the life of the down-and-outer.<br /><br />Many of the stories are told in the voice of Henry Chinaski, the autobiographical character that is at the center of Bukowski's novels.  But interestingly, some of the stories in this collection feature other characters and settings.  The collection includes, for example a fanciful story set in the old West, \\"Stop Staring ... Mister\\", and stories with imaginative, if macabre themes, including \\"No way to Paradise\\", \\"Maja Thurup\\" and \\"The Devil was Hot\\".<br /><br />The dominant impression these stories convey is one of loneliness and isolation.  Whether the character is  Chinaski or another individual, Bukowski writes of individuals who lack social connectedness and sense of purpose.  His characters are perpetual outsiders who mock a world they cannot share and simultaneously tear themselves apart.  Dostoevsky's Underground Man is a distant cousin of most of the characters we meet in Bukowski's stories.  Another book that I find similar in tone, set in New York City rather than the west coast is Hubert Selby's \\"Last Exit to Brooklyn\\" which shares much of the grimness, loneliness, sexual obsession, and search for love that I find in Bukowski.<br /><br />Some of the works included in this collection are more vignettes than short stories.  There is little in the way of development and in some cases the climax of the story is nonexistent or misfires.  There are interesting settings, however, in many of these stories and as sketches many of them work well.<br /><br />The stories that exemplify the theme of loneliness for me include the first one in the collection, titled \\"Loneliness\\" and the story \\"Remember Pearl Harbor?\\" which tells of Chinaski's rejection for military service in WW II.  These stories are good at sketching the nature of the rootless, lonely individual.  Some of the other stories in this collection that I thought good are \\"Bop Bop against that Curtain\\", \\"Christ on Rollerskates\\", \\"Hit Man\\", \\"Pittsburgh Phil & Co\\" (a fine story about gambling at the racetrack) and \\"Confessions of a Man Insane Enough to Live with Beasts.\\"<br /><br />Bukowski writes simply with short sentences in a style filled with explecatives and references to sexual and excrecatory functions.  I became interested in Bukowski's writings several years ago, put them aside, and then reread some of them after viewing an excellent film on Bukowski's life: \\"Bukowski: Born into This\\".  Bukowski is hardly a writer for all times and all seasons.  But there is a toughness and raw humor in these books, and a sense of loss and sadness that make Bukowski's books highly evocative of certain kinds of blue and lonely feelings.  The stories are metaphors of a buried life than many people see in themeselves at times in somewhat different ways than the ways presented in Bukowski's writings.  That is why, I think, Bukowski continues to have a following and to be read.<br /><br />Robin Friedmant to Brooklyn\\" which shares much of the grimness, loneliness, sexual obsession, and search for love that I find in Bukowski.

The stories are metaphors of a buried life than many people see in themeselves at times in somewhat different ways than the ways presented in Bukowski's writings.  That is why, I think, Bukowski continues to have a following and to be read.    Robin Friedman	2004-08-07
US	48185764	R2YYE6O1RBTIFB	0876853904	321736975	Women	Books	4	48	52	N	N	Chinaski's Women	I was inspired to reread Charles Bukowski's novel, &quot;Women&quot;, (1975) after seeing the recent film documentary, &quot;Bukowski: Born into This&quot; which offers a compelling picture of &quot;Buk's&quot; life replete with interviews of Bukowski, his women, and friends.<br /><br /> Charles Bukowski (1920-1994) was born in Germany but his family moved to the United States when he was three. He wandered around the country for some years living in cheap rooming houses and drinking. He worked as a laborer and for the post office for many years and wrote poems and stories in his spare time. His work gradually attracted a following and was published by Black Sparrow Press. He achieved substantial acclaim before his death and his work continues to be read. It is low-down, graphic, and visceral.<br /><br /> Bukowski's novel &quot;Women&quot; (1975), is told in the voice of a character called Henry Chinaski, as are many other Bukowski novels. The book is largely autobiographical, but the use of a fictitous narrator provides a certain distance from its author, and deliberately so. During the course of &quot;Women&quot;, Chinaski remarks more than once how his (Chinaski's) character differs to some degree from the public perception. I find it useful to remember the tension between the fictional Chinaski and the actual Bukowski in reading Bukowski's novels.<br /><br /> &quot;Women&quot; begins when Chinaski is 50 years old and is lamenting his lengthy lack of a sexual relationship with a woman. This lack is soon remedied during the course of the novel. Much of the story consists of a recounting of Chinaski's encounters with many women, most of whom are much younger than he is. Some of these encounters are brief one night stands, others continue over a period of time. Sometimes the women appear with Chinaski, leave, and then come back. Many of the women seem, in the story, genuinely drawn to Chinaski. He meets many of them through the poetry readings he gave at colleges and bars after his work acquired noteriety. Chinaski himself seems attached to at least some of these women -- perhaps more so than he would have his reader believe.<br /><br /> The activities of the characters are simply, bluntly, and clearly described and will not appeal to all readers. There is a great deal of emphasis on sex, on excretory functions, on endless drinking, horseplaying, and some drug use. Some readers will also take offense at Chinaski/Bukowski's attitude towards women, focused as it is on physical appearance and sexual activity.<br /><br /> I found the book engagingly written with its in-your-face attitude. It is gritty and realistic and describes Chinaski and his east Hollywood environs well. Many of the scenes are funny and perceptive as Chinaski mocks himself and his life. There is sexual honesty in the book as well as Chinaski shows us his failures -- which are frequent due to his alcoholism -- as well as the women that get away.<br /><br /> The book shows a degree of reflectiveness that is easy to overlook on first reading. There are times when Chinaski enjoys and glorifies his life with his sexual conquests and drink but many passages in the book suggest second thoughts and feelings of guilt. Thus, in a passage near the end of the book, which I will expurgate and abridge, Chinaski says ( &quot;Women&quot; p.236)<br /><br /> &quot;I walked away feeling worse and worse. ... I could certainly play some nasty, unreal games. What was my motive? Was I trying to get even for something. .... I tinkered with lives and souls as if they were my playthings. How could I call myself a man? ... The worst part of it was that I passed myself off for exactly what I wasn't -- a good man. I was able to enter people's lives because of their trust in me. I was doing my dirty work the easy way.&quot;<br /><br /> There is a great deal, then, of the cult figure Chinanski/Bukowski in this book but there is more than that. Bukowski may not be to everyone's liking and heshould not be any reader's sole literary fare. But there is something in the books beyond the bluster, the self-pity, and the public image. &quot;Women&quot; is worth reading.o everyone's liking and he should not be any reader's sole literary fare.

US	48185764	R2KSR0NJYBCWWL	1568496249	701170386	Vein of Iron	Books	5	23	24	N	N	Rereading Vein of Iron	Ellen Glasgow (1873-1945) was a successful writer during her lifetime, but, alas, her work is too little known today. It is due for a revival. Glasgow lived most of her life in Richmond, Virginia, and was critically praised as an early naturalist writer. She attempted to describe the South without the romantic accretions of &quot;Lost Cause&quot; mythology that arose following the Civil War.<br /><br /> Glasgow wrote Vein of Iron in 1935, and the book placed second on the best-seller lists that year. It is typical for her work which bridged the gap between serious and popular literature. I first read this novel three years ago and was pleased to have the opportunity to reread it as part of a book group. I was surprised at how much I had missed -- and probably got wrong -- on my first reading. If serious literature can be characterized as a book that bears reading slowly and more than once, then Vein of Iron has met this standard for me.<br /><br /> The book is set primarily in rural Virginia from about 1901 through 1935 (running into the first term of President Roosevelt). The story centers on the Fincastle family of Scotch-Irish descent which has lived in what has become a rundown manse in the small fictional village of Ironside since before the Revolutionary War.<br /><br /> Several family members get a great deal of attention in the novel. Ada Fincastle is a young woman in love with a young man named Ralph McBride. She loses Ralph, as a result of a forced marriage to a rich, selfish girl, Janet Rowan, who claims Ralph got her pregnant. She ultimately marries Ralph, but only after a two-day torrid affair in the woods before the divorce between Ralph and Janet is concluded. Ralph returns from WW I cynical and disillusioned and the couple struggle to retain their love for one another.<br /><br /> Ada's father, John Fincastle, is the other major character in the story. Fincastle is a Presbryterian minister who has been defrocked &quot;after he had told the Presbytery he rejected the God of Abraham but accepted the God of Spinoza.&quot; (p.45) Fincastle has spent his life writing a multi-volume work of philosophy, heavily influenced by a combination of philosophical naturalism, German idealism, Spinoza, Schopenhauer, and, I think especially, Buddhism and Eastern thought. Glasgow herself was a religous seeker of an unorthodox cast who had been fascinated with Buddhism when young. I found her portrait of John Fincastle compelling.<br /><br /> The main characters also include Ada's grandmother as well as Fincastle's wife, who dies early in the book, and a character named Aunt Meggie all of whom retain traditional Presbryterian religious convictions and all of whom are sympathetically portrayed.<br /><br /> Much of the theme of the book is stated in the title, as the characters, regardless of their differences in religious outlook maintain their fortitude and strength in the face of difficulty, adversity, and change. Besides fortitude and interior toughness, the second large theme of the book, I think, is human compassion. As the family suffers and observes the suffering of others during the Great Depression, John and ada, in particular, come to realizew and to put into practice the value of limiting one's own egocentrism and trying to work to alleviate the sufferings of others. There is a Buddhist mantra that is repeated at several important places in this novel: &quot;May all beings be delivered from suffering&quot; -- known as the lovingkindness (or metta) meditation that seemed to me initially and still seems to me upon rereading to be at the heart of this book.<br /><br /> The book has excellent descriptions of life in rural Virginia and of the growth of the urban South in a larger fictious city called Queenborough. Industrialization and the suffering resulting from the Depression are portrayed well. There are also sympathetic, non-stereotyped portrayals of African-Americans, uncommon in a work of this era.<br /><br /> For allthe descriptions of place and the intensity of the love story, I still concluded on my reading that the main focus of this book was spiritual. Glasgow writes knowingly both of the loss of faith in traditional Western religions and also of the need for the spiritual values of wisdom, self-understanding, and compassion. Her book has a serious tone throughout and her quest remains distinctly modern.<br /><br /> I found, as I did when I first read Vein of Iron that much of the book is overwritten and that its tone is melodramatic in places. In spite of that, Vein of Iron works on many levels. I found it primarily a picture of a timeless spiritual quest. It encourages the reader away from the materialism of the everyday, whether found in rural Virginia or anywhere else, to search for meaning, wisdom, and compassion, regardless of whether the reader finds these values within or without the boundaries of a traditional religous faith.the descriptions of place and the intensity of the love story, I still concluded on my reading that the main focus of this book was spiritual.

His &quot;The Life of Billy Yank: the Common Soldier of the Union&quot; (1952) is, together with its companion volume &quot;The Life of Johnny Reb, the Common Soldier of the Confederacy (1943), Wiley's best-known work. It presents an outstanding history of the day-to-day life of the soldier in the Union Army.<br /><br /> As Wiley stated in the preface to the book, his focus was &quot;social rather than military&quot;. The book offers little of the military history of the various Civil War campaigns and little of the political aspects of the War. Rather, Wiley discusses soldering in the Union Army in all its detail and drudgery. It is an indispensable source for those wishing to understand the Civil War. The book would be of interest as well to reenactors wishing to get inside and recapture life in a Civil War Army.<br /><br /> The book is well-researched and documented. It draws upon the letters and diaries of innumerable Union soldiers, both published and unpublished and on other first-hand accounts. Much of the discussion is anecdotal, but Wiley makes good use of census and statistical data as well. The book is clearly written with an obvious empathy for the life of the Civil War soldier. The book leads the reader beyond its specific subject and encourages reflection of the Civil War, its terrible human cost, and its continuing importance to our country.<br /><br /> Wiley begins with a discussion of the recruitment process into the Union Army following the attack on Fort Sumter. The book gives a good picture of the complex relationship between state militia units, the regular army, the volunteers and the draftees -- the various units that uneasily combined to form the Union army. Bell discusses -- in a subject that continues to fascinate historians -- the motivations of the soldiers who served in the conflict. In particular, he discusses the Emancipation Proclamation and considers the extent to which Emancipation was or became a goal for a large number of Union troops. Wiley sees the many sides of this question, and the issue remains one that is vigorously discussed.<br /><br /> The book describes well the rigors of training and camp life, the diseases and unhealthy living conditions which plagued the army, the boredom and enforced routines, the bad food, temptations to vice, and experience of combat. There is excellent material in the book on the organization of the Union Army. Much of the material in Wiley's study is either presupposed or otherwise not covered in other well-known studies of the military of political history of the War. The book considers the morale and fighting spirit of the men and how it varied with the fortunes of war and with the support of people at home. Again, anticipating more recent studies, Wiley discusses the ambiguous, complicated relationships that developed during the War between the Union troops and their enemies in gray. This relationship, and the instances of fraternization during the midst of a total conflict, presaged the way for reconciliation, at long last, at the conclusion of the conflict. There is a brief discussion in the book of women soldiers who enlisted in the Union army and sometimes managed to avoid detection. This subject too has received much recent attention and it is interesting to see Wiley deal with it in his early account. The book ends with reflections on the way in which the Civil War helped forged the United States into a nation.<br /><br /> This is a study that wears its age well. It will bring the reader face-to-face with the life of the Union soldier during our nation's greatest combat.ns of the soldiers who served in the conflict.

On the first day of the Battle, elements of the Union and Confederate armies collided to the North and West of Gettysburg with the result that the Union Army was pushed back to a strong position on Cemetery Hill and Cemetery Ridge to the South and East of the town. The five essays in this volume explore important and controversial actions in the following second day of the Battle.<br /><br /> The first essay in the volume is by Professor Gallagher himself, &quot;If the Enemy is There, we must attack him.&quot; This essay explores an underlying issue of the entire battle -- Confederate commander Robert E. Lee's decision to assume the offensive on July 2 and to attack the powerful Union position. General Lee's decision was opposed at the time and for many years thereafter by General James Longstree, Lee's primary subordinate. Longstreet favored a movement around the right of the Union army. Other options that Lee might have considered include assuming a defensive posture and awaiting a Union attack. Professor Gallagher explores each of these options and comes to a measured assessment of Lee's decision.<br /><br /> The second essay &quot;The Peach Orchard Revisited: Daniel E. Sickles and the Third Corps on July 2, 1863&quot; is by William Robertson, Professor at the Combat Studies Institute, U.S. Army. Professor Robertson examines the decision of Union General Dan Sickles, commander of the Third Corps of the Army, to move his Corps from the position that Union Commander George Meade assigned to it on Cemetery Ridge to a salient about 3/4 mile in front of the Union line. Controversy has raged over the years over the wisdom and effect of Sickles's unauthorized move on the result of the Battle. Professor Robertson makes an excellent attempt to examine this issue afresh. He concludes, probably contrary to the opinion of most students of the Battle, that Sickle's move had a great deal to commend it, even though Professor Robertson is highly critical of Sickles's failure to coordinate his action with Meade.<br /><br /> The third essay, &quot;If Longstreet Says so it is most likely not true&quot; by Robert Krick, a biographer of Stonewall Jackson, is polemical in character. It is highly critical of the role Longstreet played in the events of Gettysburg, particularly on the second day. Most of this essay is a discussion of various statements of other Southern leaders critical of Longstreet and a criticism of Longstreet's actions at places other than Gettysburg. A more careful examination of Longstreet's actions during the second day of the Battle itself would have been welcome.<br /><br /> The fourth essay, &quot; A Step All-Important and Essential to Victory&quot;: Henry W. Slocum and the Twelfth Corps on July 1-2, 1863&quot; is by A. Wilson Greene, executive director of the Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites. It discusses and assesses the leadership of the Commander of the Union Twelfth Corps, General Slocum, during his tardy march to the Battlefield on July 1 and during the defense of Culp's Hill on the extreme Union right on July 2. Culp's Hill remains a relatively little-known part of the Battle, but it was the scene of furious fighting. The climax of the action on Culp's Hill was General &quot;Pap&quot; Greene's holding of the position with only a single brigade against a force that outnumbered him 3-1 during the evening of July 2. Wilson Greene's essay argues that this aspect of the Battle was, indeed, not of the greatest significance to the ultimate result. He is also critical of Slocum's performance throughout the Battle.<br /><br /> The final essay in this collection is by Scott Hartwig, a ranger and historian with the National Park Service at Gettysburg, titled &quot;No troops had donebetter&quot;: John Caldwell's Division in the Wheatfield, July 2, 1863&quot;. This essay is unique in the collection in that it examines command at the Division rather than the Corps or Army level. It focuses on the bloody fighting in the Wheatfield which resulted from the position assumed by General Sickles (essay 2). Caldwell's Division was sent to reinforce the position and fought heroically, if ultimately unsuccessfully to hold the Wheatfield. This essay does an excellent job in exploring command under combat conditions featuring lack of knowledge of the position, lack of coordination, and difficulties of communication among the troops. I recently attended an anniversary battle walk at Gettysburg which covered the fighting in the Wheatfield, and Caldwell's role, in great detail. I learned a great deal by following-up with Hartwig's essay.<br /><br /> This book presupposes a basic familiarity with the Battle of Gettysburg and with the chief areas of controversy resulting from this great Battle. These essays are thoughtful and provocative and will enhance the student's understanding.roops had done better&quot;: John Caldwell's Division in the Wheatfield, July 2, 1863&quot;.

Recently, in &quot;The Illustrated Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; (2003), Professor McPherson has reformatted and edited his outstanding 1988 study. The major change to the book is the addition of many illustrations, which include photographs, portraits, paintings, cartoons, drawings, and maps from the Civil War era.  To make room for the illustrations, about 20 percent of the original text has been cut, and there are no footnotes and bibliography.<br />This illustrated version is, probably, the best single-volume introduction to the Civil War.  (Some of the works by<br />Bruce Catton come close.)  The illustrations add an irreplaceable element to the story and enable the reader to see and to get the feel of the Civil War, its era, and its major protagonists in a way the printed word cannot capture.  The photographs and the contemporary artwork, including drawings and paintings by the soldiers, are difficult to find in one place.  I found they added a great deal to my understanding.<br />Apart from the illustrations, this book remains a magisterial overview of the Civil War.  The book weaves together descriptions of the military campaigns of the War with discussions of the sources of the conflict.  It discusses in depth the differences between the North and the South in their conceptions of freedom and in their understanding of our country.  McPherson covers the domestic fronts of the War, including both economic and social issues, in both North and South and also explains the efforts of both sides in the sphere of international relations.  The book focuses on the change of the Civil War from a conflict to restore the Union to a total war to create a unified Nation.  The climactic point of the story is President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation which made the abolitition of slavery an irreducible element of the Union war effort.<br />McPherson describes eloquently how the Civil War effected a radical change in our country from a loose union of states to a united Nation.  He discusses the changing concept of human freedom and liberty which emerged from the War and which remains evolving in our country to this day.  The valor of the soldiers and civilians on both sides of the conflict is presented from the inside and with respect and reverence.  McPherson shows the reader how and why the Civil War was the turning point in our Nation's history and encourages the reader to reflect and to explore further.<br />This book is large,heavy and bulky, making it unsuitable to carry around for reading on the bus, train, or in the park.  The loss of portions of the text is a pity, but it is more than compensated by the illustrations.

It has been said that if a reader doesn't like a particular account of the battle, it is only necessary to read on to find a more appealing version.<br />Troy Harman is a historian and a ranger with the National Park Service at Gettysburg.  He has intimate familiarity with the Battlefield and a thorough grasp of the literature on the Battle.  In his book, &quot;Lee's Real Plan at Gettysburg&quot; (2003), Mr. Harman takes issue with what he terms the &quot;affirmed version&quot; of the Battle and offers what he believes to be a new and competing account.  His account is well and lucidly presented and will provoke thought among students.<br />Mr. Harman argues that most students of the Battle have tended to focus on the details of the three days of fighting and have failed to understand the plan that the Confederate commander, Robert E. Lee, developed for the Battle and pursued during its entirety.  According to Mr. Harman, Lee's focus throughout was on the heights of Cemetery Hill on the Union right.  At the conclusion of the first day's fighting, the Confederates did not attempt to capture Cemetery Hill.  But in the second day of fighting on the Union left, (Little Round Top, primarily) and in Pickett's Charge on the third day, the objective of Lee's plans, Mr. Harman maintains, was Cemetery Hill, due to its height, its control of the town and roads, and its vulnerability as a salient exposed to potential attack on three sides.<br />This is a challenging claim, particularly as it involves the second day of the Battle.  Mr. Harmon argues that Longstreet's troops were to advance along the Emmitsburg Road, which essentially parallels the Union line and take Cemetery Hill, giving only slight attention to Little Round Top.  Mr. Harmon argues that the objective of Pickett's famous charge on day 3 was Zeigler's grove on the right of the Union line rather than the more famous Angle and Copse of Trees.<br />There is a great deal to be learned from this, and from any attempt to revisit a received and too comfortably accepted account.  But I think Mr. Harman tends to overemphasize the originality of his approach and to type-cast the account with which he takes issue. The basic points in Mr. Harman's approach, involving the alleged importance of Little Round Top, the advance of the Third Corps of the Union Army to the Peach Orchard, and the focus of Pickett's Charge have been addressed by many writers. These points are and will remain highly controversial, and Mr. Harman's understanding of each of them is shared with (and also disputed by) many other scholars. Mr. Harman's primary claim -- the importance of Cemetery Hill -- has also been addressed in a slightly different way in a book called &quot;Last Chance for Victory&quot; by Bowden and Ward which likewise challenges the received account of Gettysburg.<br />Mr. Harman also is too quick, I think, in forulating his understanding of the &quot;affirmed version&quot; of Gettysburg. Most of the accounts of the battle I have read take a more nuanced view than that indicated in Mr Harman's summations.  They recognize, I think, the changing nature of the Battle and the choices these changes forced on commanders North and South.  Lee does seem to me to have ordered a charge up the Emmitsburg Road, based on the faulty information he had about the size and position of the Union troops, but this plan had to change on the spot when Longstreet discovered the location of Sickles and his third Corps.  Pickett's charge on the third day may well have had Zeigler's grove as its objective, but the fact remains that the Southern attack crested at the Copse of Trees, thus entitling it to its reputation as the &quot;High Water Mark&quot;.<br />Mr Harman has taken a fresh, lively approach to the Battle which taught me a great deal and which will inspire the interested reader to learn more.  It will instill in the reader a sense of fluidity and a reluctance to dogmatize over significant historical events.Battle which taught me a great deal and which will inspire the interested reader to learn more.

There were also over 14,000 wounded Union troops needing medical attention. The three-day Battle resulted in over 7,000 deaths, with the bodies requiring burial.<br /><br />The situation produced a humanitarian and logistical crisis for the town of Gettysburg (population 2,400). The difficulty was compounded when the Union Army, in its pursuit of the retreating Confederates, took with it virtually all available medical personnel and supplies, leaving behind an inadequate team of surgeons and support personnel to offer treatment. In addition, because of exigencies before the Battle itself, the Union medical trains had been mostly left in the rear, resulting in a delay in getting supplies to the wounded.<br /><br />Patterson's book details the sufferings and difficulties that followed in the wake of this, the bloodiest battle of the Civil War. He praises the relief efforts mounted by many private organizations, particularly the United States Sanitary Commission and the United States Christian Commission. These organizations were rivals, in a sense, but both worked valiantly to bring relief to the wounded of Gettysburg. Catholic relief organizations, such as the Sisters of Mercy, other organizations, and private citizens also contributed immeasurably. Patterson also shows how some individuals behaved less nobly by trying to profiteer from the needs of the wounded and to gather relics from the Battlefield.<br /><br />The book shows the many difficulties that needed to be addressed in short order. These included housing (many of the wounded were left an intolerably long time on the field), finding adequate medical supplies, providing food, restoring rail service and other transportation, performing necessary surgery, and much else. The military response was inadequate. But by late July, 1863, a camp had been established east of Gettysburg, known as Camp Letterman, which provided organized, centralized care for most of the remaining wounded of both armies. Without the assistance of the private organizations, the suffering would have been immeasurably more severe than it was.<br /><br />Considerations of health, if nothing else, demanded the prompt burial of the Battle dead.

These included housing (many of the wounded were left an intolerably long time on the field), finding adequate medical supplies, providing food, restoring rail service and other transportation, performing necessary surgery, and much else. The military response was inadequate. But by late July, 1863, a camp had been established east of Gettysburg, known as Camp Letterman, which provided organized, centralized care for most of the remaining wounded of both armies. Without the assistance of the private organizations, the suffering would have been immeasurably more severe than it was.  Considerations of health, if nothing else, demanded the prompt burial of the Battle dead. Patterson describes their burial, exhumation, and reburial by details established for this purpose.

The book is an inspiring example of scholarship at its best.  Coddington writes in a clear, eloquent, yet non-polemical style as he explores his subject.  He does not back away from offering opinions and conclusions, which flow clearly from his narrative account.  The reader can understand the basis of the judgments which Coddington offers.  The account is detailed and yet selective.  Coddington focuses on the broad picture of the Gettysburg story without getting bogged down in the minutae and legends that mar some otherwise excellent treatments of this battle.  Coddington focuses on &quot;why&quot; things happened as well as &quot;what&quot; happened. The reader is given a context for the Gettysburg campaign and is seldom at a loss over the reason the author is discussing and devoting time to an issue. The book is thoroughly documented and the footnotes include much essential material.<br />Coddington begins with a lengthy consideration of the factors that led Robert E. Lee to propose an invasion of the North following the Battle of Chancellorsville.  He concludes with a discussion of the Confederate retreat from Gettysburg, culminating in the return to Virginia on July 14, 1863.  He discusses well the Union pursuit and considers judiciously whether Meade should have been more aggressive in trying to cut off the fleeing foe.<br />I found the factual account comprehensive on the major points of the Battle and careful and circumspect in its conclusions. Coddington allows the reader to see the deficiencies in the Confederate command structure (lack of coordination) and the overconfidence of the Southern forces at virtually every level as contributing factors to the defeat at Gettysburg.  He is more critical of General Longstreet's role in the Battle than are many more recent accounts.  On the Union side of the line, Coddington is highly critical of Third Corps General Sickles and his salient on July 2, which came close to costing the Union the Battle.  The longest critical section of the book consists of an examination of the dispute between Meade and Sickles and his supporters following the battle regarding the wisdom, or lack of it, in Sickles's movement of the Third Corps.<br />Coddington has high, but careful praise for Commanding General Meade, for Hancock, Reynolds, Buford,Howard, and Slocum.  He shows how the Army of the Potomac, for all its awkward structure (seven Corps at Gettysburg compared to the Confederate three) and for all the rivalries between its leaders was able to function as a coordinated unit when it needed to do so and hold the Union position at Gettysburg.  Coddington has high praise for the valor of the fighting troops on both sides of the line.<br />Sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly, Coddington's book comes to grips with many competing accounts of the Battle of Gettysburg.  He points to the tendence of many students to view the battle as a series of speculative &quot;ifs&quot;  -- if General Early, Longstreet, what have you had done this at the time, the result would have been different.  Most such analyses, Coddington argues, are fruitless,  Furthermore, they tend to ignore, or downplay, the mistakes that, hindsight suggests, occurred in the Battle of the other side of the line.  Coddington shows the reader what happened, marshalls the evidence about why it happened, and allows the reader to think the matter through.<br />This is a detailed, close and thorough account of the Battle of Gettysburg that is probably best approached by a reader who has a basic familiarity with the Civil War and a general understanding of the action at Gettysburg.  It is not the only account of this endlessly fascinating battle, but it remains the standard work which needs to be considered in understanding the events of theGettysburg campaign.Gettysburg campaign.	2004-06-14

Her autobiography &quot;I give you my Life&quot; (1997), completed just before her death, tells the story of the development of her commitment to Buddhism and spirituality and of her decision at age 55 to become a Buddhist nun.  Each chapter in her brief book is introduced by a verse from the Dhammapada, a seminal Buddhist scriptural text consisting of short poems, which illuminates in a telling way the portion of her life under discussion.<br />Ayya Khema (&quot;Ayya&quot; is an honorific title for Buddhist nuns while &quot;Khema&quot; was the name of a nun during the Buddha's lifetime) was born Ilse Kussel in 1923 in Berlin to a prosperous, assimilated Jewish family.  The family fled Germany before the Holocaust and Ilse, as a teenager, travelled by steamer to Glasgow, Scotland before joining her family shortly thereafter in Shanghai.  She married in her late teens and travelled to California with her husband where she worked in a bank, had two children, and appeared settled into an American middle-class life.  As a result, she tells us, of a deepening sense of spiritual unrest, she divorced her husband and married a childhood acquaintance named Gerd, whose family had also fled the Holocaust.  She and Gern lived a wandering type of life in South America and Asia, where her husband was an engineer.  The couple ultimately settled in Australia, bought a farm and raised shetland ponies. This marriage too ended with Ilse's, continued search for spiritual wisdom and her growing interest in meditation.  Ilse became a Buddhist nun at the age of 55, helped establish three Buddhist convents in Sri Lanka, Australia, and Germany, became a meditation master, worked ceaselessly to revive the Buddhist order of nuns, and wrote prolifically about Buddhism.<br />Ayya Khema lived an inspiring and full life on many levels and she tells her story well. Apart from her decision to become a nun, I learned a great deal from her willingness to make a radical change in mid-life. It is important to see how people may change and develop throughout their lives, and I was moved to see this realized in Ayya Khema's story.<br />In many ways, Ayya Khema's autobiography radiates sincerity and purpose and fulfills its goal of speaking directly to the reader.  This is especially true in her introduction and in the sections of her book following her ordination where she explains what the Buddhist path has meant to her. The final pages of the book, written when Ayya Khema knew she would soon die, have a rare immediacy and poignancy.<br />Most autobiographies conceal as much about their subject as they reveal, and Ayya Khema's autobiography is no exception. The book gives a good picture of the externals of Ilse Kussel's life but, I thought, too little of what was going on inside.  I found myself wanting to know more about Ilse's two marriages and the reasons for their failures.  There is a brief discussion of Ilse's attempt to recover her spirituality through Judaism, and I would have liked to hear more.  Beyond references to the suffering of life and to the inevitability of change, I would have liked more detail of Ilse's early study of spiritual texts.  And I would have liked more details on the course she pursued during her meditation retreats and on what it was she learned from the Indian and Buddhist masters she reveres as her teachers.<br />This autobiography shows effectively Ilse Kussel's transformation into Ayya Khema.  It shows what was important to Ayya Khema when she became a nun and how she worked to realize herself as a Buddhist nun.  We see Ilse Kussel/Ayya Khema througout her life as an intelligent strong-willed and determined woman. I still do not fully understand, after reading this inspiring story, the internal process by which Isle Kussel became transformed into Ayya Khema.ome a nun, I learned a great deal from her willingness to make a radical change in mid-life.

US	48185764	RW9JXBGWMQEHM	0939218127	455470431	Battle of Gettysburg	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Haskell's "True Grand Epic of Gettysburg"	Frank Haskell (1828-1864) left the practice of law in Wisconsin at the outbreak of the Civil War and became a Lieutenant and an aide to Union General John Gibbon. He was killed at Cold Harbor in 1864.<br /><br />Haskell is remembered for two related reasons. First, he performed heroically during Pickett's charge on the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg. Almost single-handedly, he rallied the Union troops after the Confederates had breached the Wall and saw to the movement of supports from one portion of the line to another. Union Generals Hancock and Harrow, as well as Gibbon lavished praise on Haskell, with Gibbon writing that &#34;I have always thought that to him, more than to any one man, are we indebted for the repulse of Lee's assault.&#34;<br /><br />The second reason for remembering Haskell is the book under review. Haskell wrote it in mid-July, 1863 when the Battle of Gettysburg remained vivid in his mind. The book was initially cast as a long letter to Haskell's brother in Wisconsin and did not appear as a published book for a general audience until 1898. Haskell's book is one of the best first-hand sources we possess for the Battle of Gettysburg. It is not, Haskell himself knew, a complete history of the Battle but focuses on what Haskell saw and heard. The story is told with a passion, sweep, and literary skill that is moving. (Some modern readers may find the style overbearing at times.) Those who have studied the Battle of Gettysburg through the many secondary sources that are available, (Coddington, Sears, Trudeau, Pfanz, and others) will learn a great deal about the battle and the troops who fought from the immediacy and force of Haskell's account.<br /><br />Haskell's book covers all three days of the Battle. It includes little material on the first day since, as part of the Second Corps of the Union Army, Haskell did not witness the events of that day. There is considerable material on the second day of the battle focusing on the efforts of the Union Second and Fifth Corps in repulsing Longstreet's and Hill's assault on the Union left and center. Haskell also describes well General Meade's &#34;Council of War&#34; on the evening of July 2 and the Generals who participated.<br /><br />The chief subject of the book is the third day of Gettysburg -- commonly known as Pickett's charge. Haskell's writing picks up sweep and describes the events of that day from the opening preparations, to the famous lunch of the Federal generals before the opening of the Battle, through the cannonade, assault, breaching of the Wall and repulse. As stated above, Haskell played a pivotal role in rallying the troops at the wall to repulse the assault. Haskell's book remains an invaluable first-hand source for Pickett's charge, but it transcends them. It is a work of literature and of the history of the Civil War in its own right.<br /><br />Haskell also describes the aftermath of the battle and the attempts of the Union troops and civilians in the area to care for the wounded and bury the dead. Interestingly, Haskell witnessed and took the trouble to record the visits of tourists and curiosity-seekers to Gettysburg immediately after the Battle. Visits have continued, of course, since that time as Gettysburg became a national shrine.<br /><br />Haskell realized the difficulty that historians would have in describing the battle and in coming to a full understanding of what took place at Gettysburg. He had the wisdom to recognize that his own account captured his own impressions and experiences only and was not the full story. He wrote that &#34;by-and by, out of the chaos of trash and falsehood that the newspapers hold, out of the disjointed mass of reports, out of the traditions and tales that come down from the field, some eye that never saw the battle will select, and some pen will write, what will be named 'the history'. With that the world will be and, if we are alive, we must be, content.&#34;<br /><br />Haskell knew that a great event in our nation's history took place at Gettysburg. He voiced his hope that the Battle would lead to a stronger united nation devoted to freedom and to the best of its ideals. His book concludes with the observation that &#34;Tradition, story, history -- all will not efface the true, grand epic of Gettysburg&#34;.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanreat event in our nation's history took place at Gettysburg.

US	48185764	R5SHCC05M08NT	0743238532	635162915	Clara: A Novel	Books	5	15	16	N	N	A Novel of Clara Schumann	Clara Schumann's (1819-1896)life continues to fascinate and inspire.  I recently saw the world-premiere of an opera, also titled &quot;Clara&quot; at the University of Maryland by the American composer Robert Convery.  Clara Schumann is the subject of an excellent website and of recent biographies, including &quot;Clara Schumann: the Artist and the Woman&quot; by Nancy Reich. Clara Schumann's compositional output consists of only about 60 works, but it continues to be recorded and performed.<br />Janice Galloway's novel, &quot;Clara&quot; (2002), introduces the reader to a remarkable woman and to her times.  Clara was the daughter of Frederick Wieck, a notable piano teacher, and of a woman who left Wieck to marry another man when Clara was young.  Clara Wieck was a child prodigy with virtuosic ability at the piano.  At the time, the role of piano virtuoso was just coming into its own.<br />Clara fell in love with the great romantic composer Robert Schumann (1810-1856), ten years her senior, when Schumann was a student of Wieck.  Her father bitterly opposed the marriage, but the couple persevered and were married with permission from the German courts.  The marriage was difficult, as Robert needed absolute quiet in order to compose and was moody and tempramental to say the least.  The couple had eight children, and Clara proved determined to pursue her calling as a concert artist.  Schumann's instability gradually lead to insanity and he was institutionalized for the last years of his life following a failed suicide attempt.  The novel covers Clara's life up through the death of Robert Schumann with only brief allusions to her life as a concert pianist following his death.  Clara outlived Robert by 40 years.<br />This book presents a complelling picture of lives filed with the love of music. Robert was a highly gifted composer while Clara devoted her great talents to the art of interpretation. Ms. Galloway shows well the vicissitudes of the creative life, both for the composer and the interpreter.  The book is love story, rarer than might be supposed in today's world, presenting a picture of a gifted couple's devotion to each other. In particular, it presents a compelling portrait of Clara Schumann with her devotion to a difficult individual through his descent into psychosis.<br />Ms. Galloway stays close to the facts of her story, gets inside her characters, and avoids the temptation to judge or to editorialize based upon the values of another age.  She presents balanced portraits of the characters in her story and allows the reader to see the nuances and ambiguities inherent in all human conduct.  For example, Ms. Galloway lets the reader see that Wieck had a point, after all, in his doubts about the marriage and about Robert's mental instability which was surely visible over the years. Ms. Galloway also points out Clara's growing devotion to what she was born to do -- play the piano -- and how her independence sometimes rested uneasily with her love and commitment to Robert.  Her love for Robert was surely the most important force in her life.<br />The novel moves slowly at times, but it builds as it progresses in both writing style and in depth of understanding. The novel does an outstanding job in linking the events of Clara and Robert's lives into their music.  I enjoyed the treatment of Robert Schumann's &quot;Carnaval&quot;, a great work for the solo piano and a favorite of mine, his song cycles, piano concerto, symphonies, and other compositions which receive thoughtful attention in the book.<br />The paperback edition of this book includes some good questions suitable for book groups together with a revealing interview with Ms. Galloway. The book shows how music and creativity enable people to reach the best of what is in them and to transcend the pain of sorrow and suffering and the banalities of the everyday. I found this book a moving presentation of the love of a woman and a man for each other and of the love ofboth for music. I was both inspired by the story of Clara's life and also moved to revisit Clara's music and the music of her tormented but gifted husband.of both for music.

The Kennedy Center is presenting three of his major dramas performed by marquis stars. The Washington Opera is presenting an operatic version of \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" with music by Andre Previn.  But another Washington theatre, the Arena Stage, is taking a more adventurous approach.  It is reviving Williams's little-known work \\"Orpheus Descending\\".  It was my good fortune to see this production.  It lead me to read the play and to think about it, about Tennessee Williams, and about passionate and romantic theatre.<br />Orpheus Descending was first presented on Broadway in 1957 where it enjoyed a brief run and only modest success.  The play is a rewrite of an early Williams effort, \\"Battle of Angels\\" which was written in 1940 and poorly received. Williams was attached to Orpheus and to the effort it cost him.  When the play appeared in 1957, he wrote that \\"[o]n the surface it was and still is the tale of a wild-spirited boy who wanders into a conventional community of the South and creates the commotion of a fox in a chicken coop.  But beneath that now familiar surface it is a play about unanswered questions that haunt the hearts of people and the difference between continuing to ask them, ... and the acceptance of prescribed answers that are not answers at all.\\"<br />The play is a retelling of the Orpheus legend and deals, in the most elemental fashion, with the power of passion, art, and imagination to redeem life and return it to meaning.  The story is set in a dry goods store in a small southern town marked, in the play, by conformity, sexual frustration, narrowness,and racism.  Into the scene steps Val, a young man with a guitar,a snakeskin jacket, a past and undeniable animal and erotic energy and appeal.  He gets a job in the dry goods store run by a middle-aged woman named Lady whose elderly husband is dying.  Lady has a past and passions of her own and she is attracted to Val and to life as an antidote to her loveless marriage.  The play describes the awakening of passion, love, and life -- and its tragic consequences for Val and Lady.<br />The play deals with passion, its repression and its attempted recovery.  For Williams, I think it is about trying to live bravely and honsetly in a fallen world.  The play is replete with lush, poetic dialogue and imagery.  On the stage, the production seems in the opening sections somewhat lacking in dramatic movement, but it picks up power as the characters are developed and the play moves to its climax.  Val as Orpheus, represents the force of energy and eros which buried as they are in compromise and in humdrum everydayness have the tragic power to make life anew.<br />I felt lucky to have the opportunity to see this play.  It shows, I think, how much remains to be explored in the world of art when we look just a bit below the surface.  Those not in a position to see the play themselves will still have the joy of discovery in reading this obscure work by a great romantic American dramatist and poet.she is attracted to Val and to life as an antidote to her loveless marriage.

Although other more recent works may show more ability to assess and choose among competing sources in studying the assault, I doubt that any book cuts to the heart of the charge or presents a clearer picture than George Stewart's &#34;Pickett's Charge: A Microhistory of the Final Attack at Gettysburg.&#34; (1959) I recommend this book to readers interested in serious study of this pivotal and much-discussed event of the Civil War.<br /><br />I think it valuable to read Stewart's account together with Carol Reardon's study, &#34;Pickett's Charge in History and Memory&#34; (1997) and Earl J. Hess' study &#34;Pickett's Charge-- The Last Attack at Gettysburg&#34; (2001). These three books offer differing perspectives on Pickett's charge and will be invaluable to the student in comparing approaches to the event and to historical writing.  Reardon's book includes little about the Charge itself. She concentrates on the way it has been interpreted over the years (a matter which Stewart also addresses) and on the difficulty of separating fact from memory in determining what happened on the battlefield. The latter point is important to remember in reading Stewart. Some of his sources seem to cross that difficult line between history and recollection in memory.<br /><br />Hess' account, like Stewart's is a history of the charge which, Hess tells the reader, uses sources and files unavailable to Stewart. Hess, writing 40 years after Stewart, adopts a more critical stance towards the sources and reaches some different conclusions.<br /><br />Stewart's account is still to be prized for its simplicity and clarity and for the author's zest and empathy for his subject. The book is written in short sections which cover in detail the deliberations of the Confederate leadership on the morning of the attack, the Union defense, the cannonade, the details of the assault by the combined troops of Pickett, Pettigrew, and Trimble, and the Union's stalwart,heroic defense. The fighting at the &#34;Angle&#34; -- the High Water Mark -- is given in dramatic detail and there is a moving picture of the repulse of the Charge and its aftermath. For better or worse, Stewart lets the sources mostly speak for themselves with less of the skepticism that is to be found in Reardon or Hess.<br /><br />I found good elementary detail in the book on matters that Hess doesn't cover and that have little relevance to Reardon's story. In particular, Stewart gives a good account of weaponry, its uses, and its limitations, during Pickett's charge. This is an important matter and sometimes overlooked. The reader needs some understanding of the range and uses of the various types of artillery and infantry weapons to understand what happened during the Charge and during the Union defense. Stewart covers this well.<br /><br />Stewart emphasizes the heroism exhibited during the charge and the seesawing nature of the combat. He seems to me to take the quest for glory and victory exhibited by the troops more at their word than other recent writers who emphasize, rightly enough, the futility, destruction, sheer horror and loss of life resulting from this attack. Stewart sees Pickett's Charge is the actual, not merely the metaphorical, &#34;High-Water Mark&#34; of the Confederate War effort. He believes that if the assault force had, in fact, taken the Federal line on Cemetery Ridge during the attack, the War would have ended with a Southern victory. He also believes that the failure of the assault doomed the Confederate cause. Many other students of the Battle of Gettysburg and the Civil War would disagree with these conclusions. Stewart also states that General Pickett was responsible for the command of the entire assault force -- including the Pettigrew and Trimble troops on Pickett's left. Most students ofthe Battle reject this conclusion and point to the lack of coordination of the assault as one of the many reasons for its failure.<br /><br />Stewart tries to be meticulously fair to all participants. He avoids hero worship and &#34;Lost Cause&#34; mythology while still showing his admiration for the participants on both sides in the assault and the valor they displayed. His study may not be the last or most accurate historical study on the events of July 3. But in its simplicity, humor, compassion, and understanding of the troops, Stewart's book taught me a great deal about the final day at Gettysburg.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanthe Battle reject this conclusion and point to the lack of coordination of the assault as one of the many reasons for its failure.<br /><br />Stewart tries to be meticulously fair to all participants.

US	48185764	RDW03O4CM6R7S	0140177388	713608567	Cannery Row	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Steinbeck's &quot;Cannery Row&quot;	John Steinbeck (1902-1968) wrote &quot;Cannery Row&quot; during a brief six week period during the summer of 1944. He wrote the book, he claimed, as &quot;a kind of nostalgic thing....  for a group of soldiers who had said to me: 'Write something funny that isn't about the war.  Write something for us to read -- we're sick of war.'&quot;  Steinbeck dedicated the book to Ed Ricketts.  Ricketts was the model for &quot;Doc&quot;, the main character in the book.  Other characters, including Dora, the madam of the &quot;Bear Flag Restaurant&quot; were modeled or real-life individuals as well.<br />(The information in this paragraph is drawn from the Library of America edition of Steinbeck's novels -- 1942 -- 1952)<br />Cannery Row is set in Monterey, California during the depression.  The title derives from a portion of Monterey notorious for the processing of the multitudes of fish harvested by the sardine industry.  The book is loosely contstructed and consists more of a series of interconnected vigenettes than a fully developed novel.<br />The primary story-line of the book develops the character of &quot;Doc&quot; a marine biologist who collects frogs, octopuses, starfish, rattlesnakes, and other creatures for sale to museums, universities and others.  Doc is highly literate, a lover of science, art and music. Doc also loves his beer and his women. He is also adored by Cannery Row denizens who live in a local flophouse (the &quot;Palace Flophouse_-- a group of men headed by a character named Mack.  Much of the book centers around the efforts of these characters to plan a party for Doc.  There are many other interesting characters in the book, including Dora, the madam and Lee Chong, the proprietor of the local grocery.<br />There is much excellent descriptive writing in this book of a Monterey that is no more and of a collection of eccentric and too-lovable characters.  There are portions of the book that seem to me to lag and not to advance the course of the story.  The characters are vividly drawn, but in both the story and the characterizations I found elements of sentimentality and, perhaps, of over-simplification.<br />I think the heart of the book lies in chapter 23 where Doc philosophizes about his friendship with the residents of the Palace Flophouse and similar types of people on Cannery Row.

The Civil War, including its grandest battle, is often referred to as the &quot;American Iliad&quot; with all the horror, suffering, and search for glory of that mythical conflict between the ancient Greeks and Trojans.<br />There are many ways of approaching the Battle of Gettysburg. Some people are primarily interested in understanding simply what happened as a matter of fact. Other people are more interested in exploring its meaning -- both the meaning it may have for them personally and the meaning it has had for others. Craig Symonds's &quot;American Heritage History of the Battle of Gettysburg&quot; (2001) is a coffee-table sized book and a collage.<br />But that is just the beginning.  The book has a great deal to offer both those with a casual interest in the Battle of Gettysburg and to serious students of the War and of the Battle. It is one of the relatively unusual books that will offer something different to every reader.<br />The book includes Symonds' succinct yet informative narrative of the Battle.  He begins with the fateful decision of the Confederate military and political leadership to invade the North following Lee's victory at Chancellorsville in early May, 1863.  There is good discussion of the reasons which lead to this decision.  Symonds then follows the course of the Confederate invasion of the North together with the pursuit of the Union Army.  He discusses in a thorough, simple way the meeting of the two armies at Gettysburg, the first day's fighting, Longstreet's attack on the second day, the fighting at Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill, Pickett's Charge on the third day, and the Southern retreat and Union pursuit.  His account is less than fully detailed but it is far from superficial.  I found it showed balance and an effort to be fair to all the participants.<br />The story of the Battle has been told many times.  I thought that the many photographs, drawings, and paintings made this book fresh and valuable. To begin with, Symonds offers clear maps of some of the confusing movements on the battlefield.  The book also includes an excellent collection of historical photographs of the Battlefield that are reproduced well with cogent annotations and explanations.  The book also includes drawings of the events of the Battle, some of which were made contemporaneously with the events and some of which postdate the Battle.  Finally, there are many reproductions of paintings of scenes from the Battle of Gettysburg.  These are all reproduced well and informatively annotated and explained.<br />I was intrigued and moved to see the many photographs, drawings and paintings gathered together to illuminate a narrative history of the Battle. The paintings especially were mostly unfamiliar to me, and I learned a great deal by seeing how American artists had imagined the Battle. (The quality of these paintings as works of art is for this purpose less important than the way they present their subject.)  The Battle of Gettysburg was a historical incident which is worth studying to determine what happened and what didn't happen.  But it is also an American legend and it is more than worth seeing how Gettysburg has fared in the American imagination.<br />This book does well in capturing Gettysburg both as history and as memory.  Those with a casual interest in the Battle will receive an adequate factual account with lovely pictures and trappings.  I think readers knowing more about the Battle will find the greater interest in the photographs, drawings and paintings that show how Americans have explained and recreated the Battle of Gettysburg for themselves subsequent to the eventful days of July 1 -- July 3, 1863.d many times.

After an extensive cannonade, a Southern infantry forced crossed about one mile of open ground to attach the Union position on the center of Cemetery Ridge. A small number of Confederate troops reached and briefly penetrated the Union defense. The attack was repulsed with great loss to the Confederate troops. The Battle of Gettysburg was essentially over and the Confederate Army began a long and difficult retreat the next day.<br /><br />These are some of the bare-boned facts about Pickett's charge. General George Pickett, a subordinate of General Longstreet, commanded the right wing of the Confederate assault leading troops from Virginia. The left wing of the assault was under the command of Generals Pettigrew and Trimble from the Corps of Confederate General A.P. Hill. The assault force on the left included troops from North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, and elsewhere in the South. There was also a small column to the right of Pickett's troops that included soldiers from Florida and Georgia.<br /><br />Professor Carol Reardon's study, &#34;Pickett's Charge in History and Memory&#34; (1997) eloquently explores how and why the events of the third day at Gettysburg have assumed legendary, heroic status among so many Americans over the years. Professor Reardon gives only the briefest account of the battle itself and focuses instead on the many imponderables and uncertainties in the historical record. She has some important things to say about skepticism regarding the initial battlefield accounts, some of which were written many years after the event when memories had turned and faded. She has even more important things to say about how and why Pickett's charge became and remains a subject for contention and about why many people still find it a climactic moment of the Civil War and of American history.<br /><br />Professor Reardon describes how Virginians and North Carolinians fought between themselves about which troops had been braver and had carried more of the brunt of the failed assault. She discusses how the Charge became legendary as the &#34;High Water Mark of the Confederacy&#34; and how its repulse became viewed as sealing the fate of the Confederacy. Beginning in the mid-1870s Union and Confederate Veterans met on the Gettysburg Battlefield to relive their memories of the Charge. The former enemies had reconciled and become friends. Pickett's Charge became a symbol of the valor, the heroism, and the common bond of soldiering shared by the troops on both sides. The memory of Pickett's charge helped reunite the United States. It also, unhappily, promoted a &#34;Lost Cause&#34;, romanticized view of the Old South and tended to draw the Nation's attention away from the issues of slavery and of race relations that had precipitated the Civil War.<br /><br />I found Professor Reardon's descriptions of the reunions at Gettysburg between veterans in 1877 and 1913 the most moving and interesting part of the book, as they showed clearly the symbolic character that Pickett's Charge had assumed. Pickett's Charge became an emblem of the nature of the Civil War and of the subsequent reconciliation between North and South.<br /><br />Professor Reardon also devotes more attention to the Union side of the line than is sometimes accorded in studies of the Charge. Interestingly, she points out that Union veterans of the first and second days of Gettysburg -- the soldiers in Sickle's Third Corps, the defenders of Culp's and Cemetery Hills, among others, sometimes felt slighted at the attention lavished on the third day of the Battle at the expense of their contributions.<br /><br />In recent years, perhaps under the influence of Scharra's novel, &#34;The Killer Angels&#34; the Union defense of Little Round Top under Joshua Chamberlain and the 20th Maine have rivalled Pickett's Charge in accounts of the climactic moment of the Battle. Professor Reardon does not address this revival of interest in Little Round Top. It would be interesting to explore it in a manner analogous to her treatment of the Charge.<br /><br />I think many modern accounts of the Charge tend to emphasize its futility, the highly remote chances it had of success, and the tremendous loss of life that followed in its wake. This is a more modernistic approach to the Charge than the approach based upon a shared valor and heroism that Professor Reardon discusses. The modern sensibility has affected again the way Americans view the Charge.<br /><br />Professor Reardon has written a thoughtful meditation of Pickett's charge and its interpretation and reinterpretation over the years. She views her subject seriously and with reverence. She concludes her book with the words of a Gettysburg veteran writing in 1908 (p.213): &#34;Tradition, story, history -- all will not efface the true, grand epic of Gettysburg.&#34;<br /><br />Robin Friedmanactic moment of the Battle.

US	48185764	RM00CT6EJDN41	014017737X	779170984	The Pearl	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Steinbeck's Pearl	John Steinbeck's short novel &quot;The Pearl&quot; (1947) is unusual in that the book appeared after Steinbeck wrote a screenplay for a film of the same name.  The film was released to coincide with the publication of the book.  The novel is short, deceptively simple, and deservedly famous.  It is based upon a Mexican folk tale and tells the story of a poor family who become, potentially, wealthy by the discovery of a pearl of rare size and beauty.  This sudden wealth does not result in happiness.<br />Steinbeck sets the stage with a short, two-paragraph preface introducing the main characters: &quot;Kino, the fisherman, .. his wife, Juana, and ... the baby, Coyotito.&quot;  Steinbeck describes the story as &quot;a parable&quot; in which, &quot;perhaps everyone takes his own meaning from it and reads his own life into it.&quot;<br />Kino, Juana and Coyotito are poor and and live in a simple thatched house. The baby is bitten by a scorpion and Kino and Juana become concerned for his life but have no money to pay a doctor.  Kino miraculously finds a pearl of great worth and the couple dream of a better life.  But from the outset, the pearl provokes jealousy and violence and leads to great unhappiness for the little family.<br />I was moved by the figures of song and music that appear throughout the story. We are told at the beginning that Kino's people &quot;had been great makers of songs so that everything they saw or thought or did or heard became a song.&quot;  Kino hears in his heart various songs throughout his book, the most important of which is the &quot;Song of the Family&quot; or the &quot;Whole&quot; which celebrates his life with his wife and baby.  Other songs that figure prominently include the &quot;Song of Evil&quot;, the &quot;Song of the Sea&quot; and the &quot;Song of the Pearl&quot;.  It is interesting to follow the song imagery as the story progresses.<br />The other part of this story that most struck me were the scenes of nature -- of the water and mountains.  There is a theme of wandering that comes through poignantly in the last part of the book in which the family struggles through mountains and valleys in an attempt to evade stalkers who are pursing them for the pearl. This last portion of the book includes much moving writing.<br />Many people read this book as part of an intoduction to American literature in high school or college.  The book is accessible and short and is a highly appropriate way to get to know a major 20th Century American novelist. Still, I remember how easy it is to dislike a book forced upon a reader when young.  In my own case, I did not read this book in school (I read other Steinbeck) and only came upon it recently too many years later. In any event, it is a short and beautiful story that glows with the many colors and ambiguities as did the pearl which Kino discovered and which inspired the book.  This is a lovely work of American literature which the reader will enjoy getting to know.and mountains.

Every generation of writers and readers feels the need to tell the story of the War anew and to reflect upon its meaning.  In the mid-20th Century, the leading interpreter of the Civil War was Bruce Catton (1899-1978).  Catton wrote narratives for the nonspecialist reader. He had the ability to make the Civil War era, the battles, and the issues come alive to a broad public.  There is still much to be learned from his writing style and from his discussion of the War.<br />Catton's &quot;This Hallowed Ground: the Story of the Union Side of the Civil War&quot; (1956) remains an essential one-volume study of the conflict.  Only James McPherson's work, &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; comes close to matching its scope. While McPherson's work may show a greater degree of scholarship, Catton's work more than compensates in its eloquence and passion.<br />The book begins with the famous caning that Congressman Preston Brooks of South Carolina gave to Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts in 1856 following a Sumner speech against slavery before the Senate.  It examines the causes of the War, the battles and politics of the conflict, and concludes with the end of the long conflict in April 1865. (It gives only a brief glance to Reconstruction.)<br />Catton tells the stories of the War's military engagements simply and understandably.  I have read detailed accounts of many Civil War battles and tend to become confused.  Catton's accounts of the battled are short and, of course, simplified; but they cut to the heart of the matter.  I would recommend that anyone interested in studying a battle in depth read Catton's account first, both for an overview of the War and for a basic account of the battle and its place in the scheme of the War.<br />Catton unequivocally states that slavery was the prime cause of the War.  I think most contemporary historians agree with him.  But many recent writers try to persuade their readers that they are discovering the importance of slavery to the conflict for themselves -- almost for the first time since 1865.  It is helpful for an understanding of the history of history to see Catton's recognition (in a popular work written more than a generation ago) of slavery as the driving factor of the War.  Catton also writes eloquently about industrialization in North America and about the factors which worked ultimately to make the United States a unified nation.  I learned a great deal about the issues leading to the War and about the changes it effected in American life from Catton's account.  (In his short discussion of Reconstruction, Catton suggests that the victorious Union took an unduly punitive approach to the South.  This is one area in which many contemporary historians, I think, would tend to disagree with him.)<br />Catton's work also places great emphasis on the Western theatre of the War beginning with the capture of Fort Donelson in 1862.  He sees Antietam rather than Gettysburg as the Confederate &quot;High Tide&quot; in the conflict.  In these matters too, Catton's discussion is in accord with much recent writing on the War.<br />Although Catton's book focuses on, and is deeply sympathetic to, the Northern war effort, he portrays the Confederacy as a valiant and determined foe making its own effort to preserve what it viewed as a traditional, agrarian way of life.  Again, he never allows the reader to forget that this way of life was predicated upon slavery.  He recognizes the South's persistence in the War, the determination of its people, the courage of its soldiers, and the brilliance of Robert E. Lee without falling into &quot;Lost Cause&quot; mythology.<br />I am pleased that Catton's &quot;This Hallowed Ground&quot; remains in print and available for new readers who wish to understand our country and its greatest conflict.  This book is an excellent choice for readers who only wish to read a single workon the War.  I enjoyed the comments of the other Amazon readers who have reviewed this book.on the War.

There are fewer books still that examine in detail medical care within the Confederacy. H.H. Cunningham's \\"Doctors in Gray\\" first was published in 1958 and remains an excellent study of the Confederate medical service.<br />The book begins with an examination of the specific medical problems the Confederacy faced in 1861 which intensified as the War continued: lack of medical personnel, lack of medical supplies lack of food, an ever-tightening blockade, among others.  Cunningham then proceeds to examine the ways in which the Confederate government and military tried to bring sufficient medical care to its troops and to prisoners of war within its lines.<br />Cunningham describes the organization of the Confederate medical service and the large general hospitals the Confederacy opted to establish for the care of its sick and wounded.  The largest of these hospitals (and the largest Civil War hospital) was Chimbarozo in Richmond.  The book then considers the field hospitals established in line of battle.  Cunningham stresses the flexible, mobile nature of these hospitals and how they were constructed to move in a short time as required by the hazards of battle.<br />There are discussions on the ways in which the Confederate Medical Service endeavored to procure supplies and of how the availablity of supplies changed with the South's military fortune.  There are detailed discussions of the diseases which claimed the lives of many soldiers and sailors and their sources in the unhygenic conditions of camps and ships.  The book discusses medical care at the time of the war -- the use of chloroform, the prevalence of amputation, and experiments with various remedies to cure prevalent diseases.  Interestingly, the Confederate Medical Service was the first in wartime to establish a dental care unit for its troops.  It was well ahead of the Union army in this respect.<br />Cunningham discusses Confederate medical officers, their training and the difficulties under which they labored.  He offers judicious and thougtful assessments of the successes and failures of the Confederate Medical Service.  He concludes, reasonably enough, that it performed as well as could have been expected during that time under highly difficult circumstances.<br />Cunningham's book is still in print and worth reading.  I am pleased to see, from this site, that others are reading and learning from the book.

Controversy has ensued to the present day about the Confederacy's failure to attempt to capture this high ground on July 1, 1863, following its victory over two Corps of the Union Army to the North and West of town.  Subsequent events during the Battle, such as Pickett's charge, the fighting on Little Round Top, and the fight for the Wheatfield, have received more attention than General Early's attack on Cemetery Hill during the evening of July 2.  Yet, the fighting for Cemetery Hill was critical and may have constituted the South's best possiblity of winning the Battle of Gettysburg.<br />Terry Jones's &quot;Cemetery Hill: The Struggle for the High Ground, July 1 -- 3, 1863&quot; (2003) is part of a series called &quot;Battleground America Guides&quot; published by Da Capo Press. Each volume in the series attempts to highlight a small American battlefield or portion of a large battlefield and to explain its significance in a clear and brief narrative.  Jones's study admirably meets the stated goals of the series.<br />The book opens with a brief setting of the stage for the Battle of Gettysburg.  This is followed by chapters describing the Union and Confederate armies and the leaders who would play crucial roles in the fight for Cemetery Hill.  There is a short discussion of the fighting on the opening day of the battle, July 1, 1863, which focuses on the failure of the South to attempt to take Cemetery Hill and the adjacent Culp's Hill following its victory of that day.<br />The chief subject of the book, however, is the fighting for Cemetery Hill late on July 2. Jones explains Cemetery Hill's role in Robert E. Lee's overall battle plan.  He discusses the opening artillery duel on the Union right followed by the fierce attack by the Louisiana Tigers and North Carolina troops under the leadership of Hays and Avery on East Cemetery Hill.  This attack reached the Union batteries defending Cemetery Hill and may have come within an ace of success given the depletion of the Union defense on the Hill to meet threats on the Union left.  Elements of the Union 11th Corps and 2nd Corps reinforced the position and drove back the attack.  Southern general Robert Rodes was to have supported this attack on the west but failed to reach his position in time to do so.  General John Gordon's position was in reserve behind the troops of Hays and Avery but these troops were not ordered forward.<br />The book deals briefly with the third day of the Battle -- the day of Pickett's charge -- in which the Southern troops did not renew their efforts against Cemetery Hill -- such an attempt would have had scant chance of success in daylight.  The final chapter of the book consists of Jones's views on the events of the battle, particularly the failure of the Lieuenant General Richard Ewell of the Second Corps of Lee's Army to attack Cemetery Hill on July 1, a decision Jones finds was correct, and the causes of the failure of the July 2 attack (poor coordination among Ewell, Rodes, Gordon, and A.P Hill of the Southern Third Corps.)  There is a brief but highly useful discussion to the prospective visitor to Gettysburg of touring the Cemetery Hill portion of the Battlefield.<br />The book is clearly, crisply and succinctly written.  It includes good maps and many interesting photographs and paintings.  The reader with some overall knowledge of Gettysburg will find this book more accessible that the two volumes of Harry Pfanz's outstandingly detailed trilogy that deal with the first day of the battle and with the fighting for Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill.  Serious students of the Battle of Gettysburg can get a good, clear overview of the fighting for Cemetery Hill from this slim volume.<br />I had a few caveats.  I found some small errors in portions of the Battlefield that Jones was not treating extensively.  I found one derogatory racial reference.  I think this was due to the editorial failure toput quotation marks around a term that was used in a document contemporaneous to the Battle.  Finally, although the book gives an excellent and clear discussion of Cemetery Hill, I found it overpriced.  Readers on a budget will need to think about purchasing this volume or companion volumes in this substantively excellent series.put quotation marks around a term that was used in a document contemporaneous to the Battle.

There are three primary characters, a nameless young man who is the narrator, Sumire, a young woman who aspires to be a writer, much taken with Kerouac and the beats, and Miu, an apparently successful and polished career woman in her late 30's.  The novel involves a romantic triangle between these three characters.  The narrator is in love with Sumire, but Sumire is romantically uninterested in him or in any man. Sumire instead finds herself deeply attracted to Miu, whom she meets at a party.  The plot of the novel consists of the working out of the triangle between Sumire, Miu, and the narrator.<br />The slender,spare story of this novel is greatly enhanced by the many ways in which Murakami uses musical themes. Sumire was named after a song by Mozart with a text by Goethe which her mother heard on a recording by Elizabeth Scwartzkopf and Walter Giesking.  This song, I found, is Mozart's \\"Das Veilichen\\", K. 475 (the violet) the only song Mozart set to a Goethe poem.  It tells the story of a beautiful young woman who does some callous things.  I think the song is a symbol (another key concept in this novel) of the story as a whole.  It is good to read a book that can make creative and appropriate references to Mozart and music -- not to speak of Charles Peirce's philosophy of signs and symbols.<br />Miu aspired to be a concert pianist before an event occured which changed her life.  There are outstanding discussions in this book of music and of the joy of playing the piano.  The love of music is tied closely in this book to the welcoming and acceptance of one's human sexuality.<br />There is a spiritual theme I find implicit throughout this book which might have been more fully developed.  The book led me to think about the nature of human desire, about the relationship between sexuality and intimacy, and about frustration and unhappiness resulting from the lack of self-knowledge.  The characters in this book are all lonely and all exhibit deep sexual frustration.  The exploration of these issues suggests a consideration of the nature of desire, sexuality, change, and self-awareness that are profoundly explored in many religous traditions.<br />I didn't find the characters in this book fully bore the weight Murakami put upon them.  The male narrator for me was the only appealing character in the book.  Even here, I had trouble getting involved with a young man who remains deeply obsessed with a woman who rejects him physically in favor of a woman.  Miu left me cold, and I didn't like Sumire.

Near the end of that year, the artist Francis Carpenter determined to paint &quot;a historical picture of the first reading of the Proclamation of Emancipation&quot;.  Carpenter spent six months in the White House beginning in February, 1864, created a historically important painting of the reading of the Emancipation Proclamation to the cabinet, got to know Lincoln, and wrote a book detailing his experiences.  Carpenter wrote that Lincoln told him regarding the Emancipation Proclamation:  &quot;It is the central act of my administration, and the great event of the nineteenth century&quot;.<br />Professor Allen Guelzo tells the story of the Carpenter painting (p. 220-21), includes a photograph of the painting in the book, discusses Lincoln's statement to Carpenter (p. 186) and includes much more in his detailed study, &quot;Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation:  The End of Slavery in America&quot; (2004).  This book is a worthy successor to Professor Guelzo's recent study of Lincoln's religous and political beliefs in &quot;Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President&quot;.<br />Professor Guelzo takes issue with a historical interpretation of the Emancipation Proclamation beginning with Richard Hofstadter (1948) that argues that Lincoln had little concern with the status of black Americans and issued the Emancipation Proclamation only from reasons of prudence to protect the interests of white workers. Guelzo also approaches the Emancipation Proclamation to address recent arguments by African-American scholars skeptical of Lincoln's role and pessimistic about the future of race relations in the United States.<br />Professor Guelzo agrees that Lincoln approached the question of Emancipation cautiously. He offers several reasons for this caution. One major reason was Lincoln's fear of the reaction of the Federal courts to an attempt by the Executive to emancipate the slaves.  Lincoln had good grounds for this concern as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Roger Taney, was the author of the notorious Dred Scott decision.  Lincoln also had to act with the concerns of the border states in mind as these states were critical to the Union war effort; and he had to contend with generals and a substantial portion of the population of the North that would oppose any attempt to turn the Civil War from a war to preserve the Union to a war to free the slaves.  To circumvent these obstacles, Lincoln proposed a system of compensated emancipation and asked the border states to adopt such a plan with Federal financial assistance.  He also wanted to explore voluntary colonization efforts under which the freed slaves would be colonized in central America or in a location in the Western United States.<br />Professor Guelzo describes how the border states resisted any notion of compensated emancipation.  He also describes Federal legislative efforts, and efforts of some Union commanders, to protect former slaves making their way to the Union lines. These slaves were described by the term &quot;contraband&quot; and Congress enacted two limited statutes, called &quot;Confiscation Acts&quot; providing freedom for the &quot;contrabands.&quot;<br />In 1862, Lincoln told Secretary of State Seward and, ultimately, the rest of the cabinet, that he had determined to free the slaves in the rebelious states.  Although not a believer in any traditional sense, Lincoln stated that this course was forced upon him by God and Providence.  He issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation in September 22, 1862 and the final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863.<br />Professor Guelzo describes the origins of the Proclamation, and the effect of its issuance on the Union, the Confederacy, the free blacks, and the slaves.  He also describes the impact of the Proclamation on the foreign affairs of the United States and on the conduct of the War  -- as is well known, following the Proclamation the Civil War changed in character to total warfare.<br />He describes the precarious legal basis for the Emancipation Proclamation and points to Lincoln's courage and determination in the face of doubt.  Although some scholars have argued that the Proclamation had, in fact, no legal effect and freed no slaves, Professor Guelzo argues persuasively that it was and remains the pivotal event of the Civil War and the single most important factor in the destruction of slavery.<br />Following Lincoln's assasination, the Freedmen from the Southern states contributed funds for the construction of a statue of Lincoln emancipating a slave.  The statue stands in Lincoln Park in Washington, D.C.  It was dedicated in 1872, with remarks by Frederick Douglass.  (I was moved to visit Lincoln Park to see the statue after hearing Professor Guelzo speak last year at a conference in Washington.)  Douglass described Lincoln as &quot;a white man who shared the prejudices common to his countrymen towards the colored race.&quot; (p. 249) Yet he recognized that, in issuing the Proclamation Lincoln was &quot;swift, zealous, radical, and determined.&quot; (p. 250) In Professor Guelzo's words, the Emancipation Proclamation was &quot;an act of spectacular political daring&quot; (p.249)<br />This is a thorough, well-balanced, yet inspiring study, of what indeed has fair title to be the Great Event of the Nineteenth Century.  The book will help the reader understand where our country has been in securing racial justice and in bringing to pass and expanding upon the American dream.ng the Proclamation the Civil War changed in character to total warfare.<BR>He describes the precarious legal basis for the Emancipation Proclamation and points to Lincoln's courage and determination in the face of doubt.

Catton's books are accessible, informative, and a pleasure to read.  He once said: &quot;Whatever else history is, it should be a good yarn.&quot;  His books are, indeed, &quot;good yarns&quot; and more.<br />Catton's &quot;The Coming Fury&quot; appeared in 1961 as part of a three-volume trilogy commemorating the Civil War centennial. It tells the story of the origins of the conflict and takes the story through the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861.<br />The book begins with the Presidential conventions of the political parties in 1860, showing how the Democratic party split into northern and southern components and how this party split led to the disaster of secession, disunion, and war. The story of Lincoln's election is well-told, but Catton's book picks up  momentum with his treatment of the decisions to seceede of the 11 Southern states.  The treatment of the final days of the Buchanan administration, the political maneuvering over Fort Sumter, and the attack on Fort Sumter which precipitated the War are told with the literary skill of a born storyteller and are full as well of good thought and information.<br />The book offers an excellent sense of the mood of the country at the onset of the 1860s and of the passions aroused over slavery and sucession.  Catton shows how hotheads and extremists ultimately were put in control of events which spiraled inevitably into the Civil War.  Catton shows a great deal of sympathy for those figures who tried, literally at the last minute, to stave off the conflict and settle the differences between the North and South through compromise.<br />The book spends a great deal of time on the four border states -- Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri, and Delaware.  Catton explains how these states were essential to the Union war effort and shows as well the careful and individualized manner in which Lincoln treated each of these states to keep them precariously in the Union.<br />The book concludes with a discussion of the early military efforts of the War, with emphasis on First Bull Run.  The chief protagonists involved in the War, both for the Union and the Confederacy, are kindly and convincingly portrayed.<br />This book is a good introduction to the Civil War and to its causes. Those who have read a great deal about the War may still learn from Catton's account. Catton writes simply and well.  His book will encourage the reader to learn more about this seminal event in American history.shows as well the careful and individualized manner in which Lincoln treated each of these states to keep them precariously in the Union.<br />The book concludes with a discussion of the early military efforts of the War, with emphasis on First Bull Run.

US	48185764	R1N7W3490DLOLB	0060524235	848654534	Escaping the Delta: Robert Johnson and the Invention of the Blues	Books	5	73	80	N	N	The Blues and Romantic History	Many Americans have shown a great interest in &quot;roots&quot; music as part of a highly commendable effort to understand our country's life and culture.  Much of this interest has, over the years, focused on the blues of the Mississippi Delta and, in particular, on the recordings of singer and guitarist Robert Johnson (1911 -1938). Johnson was an obscure figure in his day and his life and music remain the stuff of legend.  He had two recording dates in 1936 and 1937.  His music was rediscovered in the 1960s and since that time the sales of his collected recordings have numbered in the millions.<br />In &quot;Escaping the Delta: Robert Johnson and the Invention of the Blues&quot; (2004), Elijah Wald offers a compelling study of the blues and of blues historiography focusing on Robert Johnson. Wald tries to correct what he deems to be the prevailing myths about Johnson: that he was a primitive folk artist caught in the Mississippi Delta who recorded and perfected a local traditional form of blues.  Wald finds Johnson an ambitious young singer who had studied the blues forms popular in his day.  Johnson, Wald argues, wanted to escape the Mississippi Delta and pattern himself on the urban blues singers, in particular Leroy Carr, emanating from the midwest and Chicago.<br />Wald finds that Johnson displayed a variety of blues styles in his recordings and that he was largely ignored by black music listeners of his day because Johnson's early efforts to capture an urban blues style were basically copies of more successful singers and because his songs in the Delta blues style lacked appeal to the urban and sophisticated black audience of the time.<br />Johnson's music only became well-known, Wald argues, with the rise of English rock, and with his rediscovery by a largely white audience.  The tastes of black music listeners had moved in a mostly different direction towards soul, funk, rap, disco and did not encompass rural blues singers.  The fascination of modern listeners with Johnson, according to Wald, is due to a romantic spirit -- a boredom with the life of the everyday -- and a search for a past full of authentic individuals who knew their own wants and needs and who projected themselves in their art.<br />Wald's book begins with a history of the blues before Robert Johnson focusing on the commercial character the music had at the outset.  He gives a great deal of attention to the Blues queens -- Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey -- and to their smooth-voiced male sucessors, particularly Leroy Carr, as mentioned above, and Lonnie Johnson.  These singers profoundly influenced Johnson's music and his ambitions to become a popular entertainer and not a cult figure.<br />The central part of Wald's book consists of a brief biography of Johnson -- summarizing the various speculations on his life -- and of a song-by-song discussion of his recordings.  In this discussion, Wald discusses the music with a great deal of intelligence and understanding.  He shows very clearly Johnson's debts to his more commercially sucessful predecessors and explains as well the variety of blues styles Johnson encompassed in his songs.<br />The final portion of the book carries the story of the blues forward beyond Robert Johnson's death.  It shows how the music at first evolved into a combo style, again approaching popular music, which took blues into a different direction from Johnson's recordings.  The book concludes with a discussion of Johnson's rediscovery, and the discovery of other Delta blues singers, beginning in the 1960's.<br />Wald clearly knows his material.  For all his criticism of the mythmaking cult over Johnson, Wald's love for this music shines through, as he is the first to admit.  Upon reading this book, I spent considerable time relistening to Johnson's music and felt I came away with a better understanding and appreciation of it than I had before.  The goal of every book about music should be to encourage its readers to return to (or get to know) the songs, or what have you, themselves.  The book meets this goal admirably.<br />There are few books on the blues that manage to be both scholarly, critical, and inspiring and Wald's book is one of these few.  I do not find Wald's thesis as unsusual as he claims it to be, but it certainly will be worth exploring by listeners and readers who do not have a large backround in this music.<br />In music, a fair and careful historical account will in the long run perform a greater service to the music and the artists than will legends and stereotypes.  The Delta singers discussed in this book, Robert Johnson, Son House, Skip James, Charley Patton, were musicians of talent.  Understanding their story can only increase the listener's appreciation of the blues.get to know) the songs, or what have you, themselves.

The tactics and strategies used by the Armies, the significance of the Battle to the result of the Civil War and to the nature and purpose of our country continue to be debated vigorously.<br />Literally at the moment the armies left Gettysburg with the dead and wounded still on the field, tourists began to visit the battlefield, some to gape from curiosity and some to ponder the battle and its significance.<br />Jim Weeks's \\"Gettysburg: Memory, Market and an American Shrine\\" (2003) tells the story of tourism at Gettysburg and of its changes in character over the years as the United States changed.  He sees a basic tension in Gettysburg visitors and in the manner in which Gettysburg is presented to its visitors.  On the one hand, Gettysburg is a shrine, hallowed ground, commemorating an important event in our history.  It is thus a place for contemplation and reflection about the American experience.  On the other hand, Gettysburg is a tourist destination and a place of pleasure and commercialism  Visitors come seeking souvenirs, good food, hotels, and entertainment.  Those purveying the town and its attractions to the visitors are interested in earning a living and in commercial success.<br />Weeks does a good job tracing the relationship between these goals as he examines the history of tourist visits to Gettysburg.  He shows how after the battle Gettysburg appealed to \\"genteel tourists\\" who had the leisure and means to travel.  With the resurgence of veterans groups, the battlefield became bedecked with monuments which required leisure to read and to comtemplate.  Shortly after the monmuments were constructed, more Americans began to share in the benefits of prosperity.  They sought entertainment at Gettysburg and mass attractions with the coming of the railroads.  In the mid-20th century, American culture changed again with the onset of the automobile and the onset of family touring with children.  The new century, Weeks argues, sees a more framgmented United States, with Gettysburg appealing primarily to men, to reenactors of Battles and to Civil War hobbyists and \\"buffs\\".<br />Weeks book is well-documented.  He offers the reader a good factual overview of the history of Gettysburg tourism and relates it well, on the whole, to trends in American society.  His book is also thoughtful and his points worth considering even when the reader may disagree with him.<br />A major problem I found with this book was in what I found to be its patronizing voice.  Weeks is surely right to emphasize how changes in society have affected the way Americans view Gettysburg and what those who visit the battlefield expect from their trip.  However, as he passes through the various kinds of tourism over the years at Gettysburg, Weeks adopts an overly-mocking tone.  For every type of tourist and era of tourism, Weeks is critical.  He is adept at pointing out the shorcomings of individual visions, but not emphatic enough in understanding what it is that brought people to Gettysburg over the years and why this was valuable, with our without the commercialism and the foibles of each individual age.  He plays different visions of Gettysburg off one against the other and is particularly critical of modern tourism and what he sees as the cult of \\"heritage\\" and \\"authenticity\\".  Some sense of charity and symphathy with the diverse goals people have had in visiting Gettysburg -- the pleasurable and the uplifting -- would have been welcome.<br />I found this book a good factual history.  I found the book's tone and its way of analyzing and presenting the facts less than convincing.hanged again with the onset of the automobile and the onset of family touring with children.

The primary battles during this period were Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg. The Army of the Potomac had a different commander in each battle, Burnside, Hooker, and Meade, to face Confederate general Robert E. Lee, who had already assumed almost legendary stature.<br /><br />Catton captures these battles well, in a rhythmic and readable prose without getting bogged in the detail of many more minute battle accounts. He also does well in tying the courses of the battles together, something more specialized accounts frequently fail to do. The reader wanting a basic understanding of the battles will find it here.<br /><br />But there is much more to this book than a description of combat. For me, Catton made the Army of the Potomac come alive. He tells the story of how the Army survived its many defeats and came through as a strong, tough fighting force lacking illusions. The Army survived a series of weak commanders and took control of itself.<br /><br />Catton also does an excellent job of weaving the military course of the War with political and social history. He discusses the politics within the Lincoln administration and the activities of the Copperheads -- Northerners sympathetic to the Confederate War effort. He also gives a fine account of the origins of the United States Sanitary Commission -- a private organization which played a great role in improving medical care for the wounded of the Civil War. Catton's history shows how the United States kept growing almost in spite of itself during the war years, and he captures the transition from a government based on the states, in both North and South, to a strong national government.<br /><br />The book is well-written, easy to follow, and has moments of real eloquence. I was moved by the discussion of Pickett's charge on the third day of Gettysburg and by the discussion of Lincoln's famous address. There is real feeling in this book for the war and for the troops that fought it, with a focus on the Union side of the line. Virtually everything covered in this book has been written about with more detail by others. But for a basic account of the Civil War and of the ebb and flow of its course, Catton's account remains a gem. I learned a great deal from it.

He shares this ability with Professor James McPherson but with few others. Unlike Professor McPherson, Gallagher's writings concentrate on the Confederate war effort.  He brings an obvious sympathy and understanding for his subject without overromanticizing of glorifying it.  This is also highly unusual among writers on the Civil War.  His essays are informed, through, balanced, and inspiring.  They are a pleasure to read.<br />Professor Gallaher's &quot;Lee and his Generals in War and Memory&quot; (1998) consists of thirteen essays, most of which have been published elsewhere.  I think the unifying theme of this collection is Professor Gallagher's attempt to find a middle ground between the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; interpretation of the Confederate war effort and recent, critical and revisionist accounts.<br />The &quot;Lost Cause&quot; school sees the Southern cause as entirely noble, tends to glorify Robert E. Lee and the valor of the Confederate troops, and attributes the defeat of the Confederacy almost entirely to the Federal's overwhelmingly superior resources and numbers.  The revisionist school emphasizes the origins of the Civil War in the institution of slavery, tends to be critical of Lee and his aggressive and costly (in terms of casualties) approach to battle, and emphasizes Union skill and tenacity, among other factors, in finally winning the war.<br />The first section of Professor Gallagher's book consist of four essays on Lee which both explain the high regard in which he was held in the South while acknowledging mistakes and shortcomings.  There is an introductory essay, &quot;Lee and the Southern People&quot; followed by essays on the Seven Days Battles against McClellan, Lee's actions on the second day of Gettysburg, and Lee's role in the Wilderness campaign of May, 1864.<br />The second part of the book, &quot;Lee's Generals&quot; includes a discussion of Stonewall Jackson's military reputation and how it was in large part deserved but also partly the result of chance and circumstance.  In this regard, the section also includes an excellent essay comparing Jackson's 1862 Shenendoah Valley campaign, which was one of Jackson's great successes, with Early's 1864 campaign, generally regarded as a disaster. Professor Gallagher offers some unusual insights.  This section also includes a thoughtful essay on A.P. Hill's and Richard Ewell's controversial roles during the first day of Gettysburg, as well as essays on Longstreet and John Magruder.<br />The third section of this book covers the history of Southern interpretations of the War, particularly the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; school of interpretation.  Gallagher presents a well-balanced account of Jubal Early, whose writings became predominant in the &quot;Lost Cause school&quot; and a discussion of the Civil War letters frequently attributed to George Pickett -- of Pickett's charge on the third day of Gettysburg. Gallagher describes the history of these letters and concludes, in common with most scholars today, that they are in fact forgeries written by Pickett's wife.<br />A final section of the book offers a discussion of Ken Burns' &quot;Civil War&quot; series on public TV, which has much good to say about it, and Professor Gallagher's assessment of the continued importance of Civil War battlfield preservation to help educate the public about our Nation's history and about this seminal conflict.<br />I learned a great deal about the Civil War and about Confederate leadership from Professor Gallagher's fine collection of essays.nerals&quot; includes a discussion of Stonewall Jackson's military reputation and how it was in large part deserved but also partly the result of chance and circumstance.

This campaign culminated in the Battle of Gettysburg.  As is well known, Jeb Stuart had embarked on a ride-around of the Union army beginning on June 24.  He did not rejoin General Lee until late on July 2, well into the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg. Mr. Longacre examines Stuart's ride and its impact in detail.  But he offers as well a comphrensive account of cavalry operations throughout the campaign.  This is a subject that is sometimes overlooked, and it is good for those interested in the history of the Pennsylvania campaign to have the information gathered in one study.<br />An excellent feature of the book is the background Mr. Longacre gives on cavalry operations and on their development in both armies.  Mr. Longacre also spends substantial time on the leaders of both the Confederate and Union cavalries -- during the time of this study Stuart for the South and Pleasanton for the North.  He explains why the personal, hands-on dashing activities required in cavalry operations tended to attract flamboyant types of leaders.<br />Mr. Longacre describes well the different fighting styles of the Southern and Northern mounted arms and show too how the North gradually was able to turn its cavalry into an effective fighting force.  He finds that the Union was well on its way to doing so by the Pennsylvania campaign, but he concludes that the Union cavalry still was not quite the equal of the Confederate unit during these summer months of 1863.<br />Mr. Longacre provides detailed discussions of the important and large-scale cavalry battle at Brandy Station, Virginia at the outset of the Pennsylvania campaign and follows it with accounts of engagements at Aldie and Middleburg as the Confederate infantry advanced.  There is a good account of the backround of Stuart's ride-around, with Mr. Longacre less critical of Stuart than many other writers.  He examines the battles between Stuart and the Union cavalry, particularly at Hanover, before Stuart finally rejoined General Lee on July 2.<br />The Union cavalry gets even-handed attention.  Mr. Longacre offers excellent accounts of Burford's role in delaying the Confederate advance on the first day of the Battle and the significant fighting of Union General David Gregg against the Stonewall Brigade on the evening of July 2.  This fighting greatly weakened the Confederate force which attacked Culp's Hill on the far right of the Union line, perhaps saving it from capture.<br />Mr Longacre offers a detailed account of the sometimes forgotten fighting at the east cavalry battlefield, some 4 miles east of Gettysburg on July 3.

The Battle itself was only the climax of Robert E. Lee's Pennsylvania campaign which also included a raid on Gettysburg by Confederate General Jubal Early on June 26, and a long difficult retreat back to Virginia by Lee's defeated army following the battle.<br />The story of this great battle has been told many times.  Although there are also good accounts of the aftermath of the battle and of the effects of the battle on the town, they are not as numerous as the books devoted to the combat and, frequently, tend to be devoted to specific issues (such as the care of the wounded following the battle.)<br />I found George Sheldon's book \\"When the Smoke Cleared at Gettysburg\\" (2003) performed a real service.  It presents a good overview of the aftermath of the Battle of Gettysburg in a simple clear way.  The book is intended for nonspecialists with an interest in the battle and in the Civil War.  On the whole, it is ably written and well researched.  I learned a great deal from it.<br />The book begins with a good and appropriate overview of the history of the town of Gettysburg before the Civil War, including its demographics (about eight percent of the residents of Gettysburg were African American) and politics. There is a  discussion of the effect on the town of the pending Confederate invasion during June, 1863 and of the effect of Early's raid late in June. This is followed by a brief treatment of the Battle itself.  There is an excellent picture of the Confederate Army's retreat through the mud and the rain beginning on July 4 and of the hardships the retreat imposed on many wounded soldiers.<br />The book describes very well the carnage of the Battle and of the strain that burying the dead and caring for the wounded put upon a small Pennsylvania town of 2400 people.  The horrors and unsanitary conditions of the field hospitals are well described.  I also found this book give a good basic treatment of the assistance provided by the United States Sanitary Commission and the United States Christian Commission in caring for the wounded at Gettysburg. The book also discusses the history of Camp Letterman, the hospital facility that the military established east of Gettysburg two weeks after the battle to care for the wounded. The information is given in sufficient detail to be useful but it does not purport to be a full history of the subject.<br />The book discusses the effect of Gettysburg on the civilian population with good, clear, and specific references to some of the townspeople who wrote memoirs of their experiences.  Again the coverage was sufficient to be informative without making a pretense of being exhaustive.  The book also pays attention to African Americans in Gettysburg and the effect of the Battle and of Lee's invasion upon them. This is an area that has not been fully studied, and Mr. Sheldon's book helps fill a real gap.<br />The book discusses the burial of the dead of Gettysburg and the exhumation and reburial of many of them in the Gettysburg National Cemetery.  There is a short treatment of the dedication of the Cemetery and of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.  The book then concludes with a short history of the creation and administration of the Gettysburg Military Park, currently administered by the National Park Service, and of the reunions of veterans at Gettysburg in 1913 and 1938. The book bears eloquent, if brief, testimony to the importance Gettysburg has assumed to many Americans over the years.<br />This book is written in a popular, journalistic way but it should not be underestimated. Mr. Sheldon has done his research and has succinctly told the basics of an important story in a single book.  The reader wanting to learn about the aftermath of Gettysburg will not be disappointed.

US	48185764	R15HC3ZDG0JNCA	0195102231	300297013	The Gettysburg Nobody Knows (Gettysburg Civil War Institute Books)	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Thoughtful Essays on Gettysburg	The Battle of Gettysburg was fought from July 1-13, 1863 and ended the Confederacy's second invasion of the North. It was the bloodiest battle fought in North America. (The Battle of Antietam was the bloodiest single day.) Although there are many outstanding narrative accounts of the battle, the literature which carefully examines aspects of the battle and their significance is less extensive. Gabor Boritt's collection &#34;The Gettyburg Nobody Knows&#34; (1997) consists of nine essays by outstanding scholars which elucidate the battle and its consequences. Each essay is accompanied by notes and by comments by each author suggesting further reading.<br /><br />The book derives from presentations at the annual summer Civil War Institute in Gettysburg. Professor Boritt is the Director of the Institute. There is a wonderful tone of scholarship and of the desire to learn that pervades this volume. One of the authors reflects that all the participants in the seminars -- and the readers as well -- are students trying to learn rather than experts with all the answers. This attitude is one that could well be emulated in scholarship and intellectual activity of all kinds. It is a joy to have it presented in this book.<br /><br />The essays cover a great variety of topics. The first essay by Joseph Glatthaar discusses the role of the common soldier in the Gettysburg campaign and points out how the Confederate Army may have been at once tired, overconfident, and undisciplined in its movement to the North. Glenn LaFantasie follows this essay with a discussion of Joshua Chamberlain, the hero of Little Round Top which endeavors to separate the facts from the myths that have grown around Chamberlain. To my reading, Chamberlain still emerges from the essay as a highly impressive figure.<br /><br />Harry Pfanz has written three extensive narratives on the Battle of Gettysburg. In this volume, he contributes a slim but succinct essay on the Confederate General Richard Ewell. Pfanz largely exonerates Ewell from the criticism he has suffered in many quarters for failing to advance on Cemetery and Culps Hills on the first day of the battle.<br /><br />Kent Gramm's essay on the First Minnesota is an outstanding meditation on the hazards and chances of war and of the role of individual responsibility and action. It also has a great deal worthwhile to say about the Generalship of Lee, Meade, Longstreet, and Sickles. This is highly reflective, thoughtful historical writing.<br /><br />Emory Thomas's essay examines the role of JEB Stuart's cavalry in the battle and the impact of his absence. Unlike many studies, it focuses on the fighting on East Cavalry on the third day and his some insightful thoughts about the importance of that action and why it turned out the way it did.<br /><br />Carol Reardon is a highly-regarded student of Pickett's Charge. Her essay focuses on the Union side of the line and on the difficulty of separating fact from myth in considering this legendary charge.<br /><br />Three essays focus on the aftermath of the battle. Matthew Gallman and Susan Baker present an interesting essay on the aftermath of the Battle of Gettysburg upon the town -- focusing upon the social structure of the town and of the heroic efforts made by many to take care of the sick and wounded. Amy Kinsel's essay is also a meditation upon a history and considers how the image of the Battle of Gettysburg has changed over the years as Americans rethink the Civil War and its significance. Finally, an outstanding essay by Richard McMurry considers the military significance of the Battle of Gettysburg. McMurry presents a strong case that the Union won the Civil War in the West, in the battles of Fort Donelson and Shiloh and in the subsequent capitulation of Vicksburg, which occurred at the same time as the Battle of Gettysburg. Thus he tends to downplay the military importance of Gettysburg. His essay is well-argued and provocative but does not fully address the hold Gettysburg retains on the American imagination.<br /><br />This is an excellent book for people who have read about the Battle of Gettysburg and want to expand their thinking. New readers may be moved to explore the Battle in detail. Altogether the book offers an excellent illustration of how to approach and address historical and cultural questions of moment.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanld Gettysburg retains on the American imagination.<br /><br />This is an excellent book for people who have read about the Battle of Gettysburg and want to expand their thinking.

With this encounter, the Battle of Gettysburg was underway.<br /><br />The first day of the battle is sometimes neglected in comparison to the fighting on day 2 at Little Round Top and the Peach Orchard and Pickett's charge on day 3. But the fighting on July 1 was decisive to the Union's victory at Gettysburg. From sunrise on July 1 to about 4:30 p.m, the Union first and eleventh corps held off a larger force of Confederate troops under the Corps commanders A.P. Hill and Richard Ewell. Their stand enabled the remaining elements of the Federal army to concentrate on the high ground of Cemetry Hill and Cemetry Ridge southeast of Gettysburg which was to prove an almost impregnable position. In addition, the Union Army inflicted great losses on the attacking Confederates. The Southern casualties on day 1 severely hampered the Southern attacks on days 2 and 3, particularly on the Union right on Cemetery and Culp's Hills and in the attacks on both days on the Union Center.<br /><br />There are a number of detailed studies of the fighting on July 1, but I found Hassler's short book &#34;Crisis at the Crossroads&#34; (1970) extremely lucid and useful in explaining the confusing, frequently uncoordinated events of that day. The book begins with a discussion of the convergence of the Union and Confederate armies in the environs of Gettysburg, stressing the lack of knowledge of each side of the movements of the other side. Then there is a short but extremely helpful discussion of the topography of Gettysburg, including the ten roads leading into the town and the geographical features of the terrain that played a critical role in the troop movements and in the outcome of the fighting. Many studies do not pause to give an overview of the terrain. This makes the account of the battle more confusing and harder to follow than it needs to be. Hassler's book, after the reading of several other accounts of day 1, helped me a great deal in following what was happening.<br /><br />In short, focused chapters, Hassler discusses the early morning encounter between Buford and Heth, the death of Union General Reynolds, the repeated fighting at the railroad cut in the morning and afternoon, the defeat of the Eleventh Corps north of of Gettysburg by Early, the fighting at Oak Ridge, the ultimate defeat of the Union First Corps on McPherson and Seminary Ridge, and the Union retreat through Gettysburg to Cemetery Hill. Hassler addresses the most common question arising from the first day of the Battle: whether Ewell and Lee should have pursued the attack on Cemetery and Culps Hills. He concludes that such an attack would likely have failed. The book ends with a short chapter in which Hassler gives his views and conclusions on the fighting on day 1 and on its impact on the rest of the battle. I found his discussion judicious and insightful.<br /><br />Hassler describes the battle both from the perspectives of the commanders and also from the view of the foot soldiers on the line. The role of artillery in the battle receives great emphasis. There are places were more maps would have been helpful. Hassler's stresses the valor and conviction demonstrated by the soldiers of both sides on that dreadful, eventful day. His study concludes (p. 155)with the words:<br /><br />&#34;[t]heir conduct was indeed sublime&#34;.<br /><br />This book lacks the detail of Henry Pfanz's study of day 1, but I found Hassler gets to the point quicker and is easier to follow. I suggest the reader with a strong interest in exploring day 1 of Gettysburg read Hassler's book first, if possible, and then follow it by a detailed reading of Pfanz. This book will help the student of the Civil War understand our country's greatest battle.<br /><br />Robin Friedmand harder to follow than it needs to be.

US	48185764	R3E4YTMSZ7UAS3	0520237463	74870525	Late Beethoven: Music, Thought,  Imagination	Books	5	72	74	N	N	Solomon on Late Beethoven	Maynard Solomon has followed-up his distinguished biography of Beethoven (rev.ed. 1998)with an outstanding study of the music of Beethoven's third period and of the intellectual and emotional changes in Beethoven's outlook that likely contributed to Beethoven's late masterworks.  These works include the Ninth Symphony, the Missa Solemnis, the Diabelli Variations, the final string quartets, including the great fugue, and the final five piano sonatas.<br />Solomon's biography of Beethoven was both notable and controversial for its psychoanalytical approach.  I find that approach mostly lacking here.  For his approach to Beethoven's inner life and development, Solomon draws extensively on Beethoven's Tagebuch, which Solomon describes as &quot;the intimate diary [Beethoven] kept between  1812 and 1818 to which he  confided his innmost feelings and desires&quot; (p.2).  Solomon finds a &quot;sea change&quot; (as he titles his Prologue) in Beethoven's system of belief beginning in about 1810. Following Beethoven's comparatively fallow period as a composer between 1812-1816, this change in Beethoven's beliefs bore its consequences in the works of his final maturity.  In general, Solomon finds Beethoven's beliefs changed from the rational, enlightment, classical thought that characterized, for Solomon, the first and second period works, to a more romantic belief system that focused on inwardness, theology, (I found it fascinating that Beethoven showed awareness of and interest in Eastern thought in the Tagebuch), nature, and imagination. In sum, Beethoven in his final period came more under the influence of romanticism (whatever that notoriously vague term might mean) than is sometimes realized. Furthermore, with his nearly total deafness and the failure of his attempts to establish a lasting relationship with a woman, Beethoven tried mightily to devote his life to the pursuit of his art rather than to his own personal, less exalted ends.<br />The book consists of twelve chapters, some of which were earlier published, which Solomon has worked into a coherent whole.  Of the twelve chapters, seven are examinations of the sources of Beethoven's thought and deal in broad concepts.  Thus two chapters explore the relationship between concepts of classicism and romanticism -- highly slippery concepts as Solomon realizes-- and argue that Beethoven's final work and thought show an increased romantic influence -- particularly in its transcendent element.  Two chapters discuss the possible influence of Freemasonry upon Beethoven while an additional chapter discusses the increased religious dimension in Beethoven's final works, including the influence of Eastern thought.<br />The remaining five chapters focus on individual works.  The Diabelli Variations receive two detailed chapters. The first of them explores Diabelli's waltz theme and the attraction it might have had for Beethoven while the second is a detailed analysis of the pattern of each of the 33 variations, including copious musical illustrations.  There is an outstanding chapter on Beethoven's opus 96 violin sonata and its source in pastorale.  There is a chapter on the seventh symphony (not usually considered a late work) and on the influence it shows of Greek poetical meters, and a thorough chapter on the Ninth Symphony. This description only briefly touches the scope of the book as Solomon has provocative things to say about the last quartets, particularly on the opus 130 quartet and on the question of its two finales: the grosse fugue and the much simpler rondo which Beethoven substituted for it. And, as I mentioned, Solomon says much about the last piano sonatas, the Missa Solemnis and about the song cycle &quot;An die Ferne Geliebte&quot; even though these works do not have a specific chapter devoted to them.<br />I found it a joy to read this book. It combines a love and emotional understanding of Beethoven's music with deep erudition and a love of learning.  Beethoven's music and intellectual development are well-discussed even if the reader finds himself not agreeing with all Solomon's arguments.  The book is full of detailed consisderation of specific works including quotations from Beethoven's scores.  It is probably  a book that will be most appreciated by those who have some familiarity with Beethoven's music, particularly the works of the third period, rather than by those coming to the music for the first time.<br />This is a difficult, challenging, and revealing study of late Beethoven combining scholarship, philosophical thinking, and a love and understanding of Beethoven's music.nd intellectual development are well-discussed even if the reader finds himself not agreeing with all Solomon's arguments.

US	48185764	R2NL7GCK1J9MFJ	0861711033	628356539	The Long Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Digha Nikaya (The Teachings of the Buddha)	Books	5	85	86	N	N	The Digha Nikaya	This book is a modern translation of the Long Length Discourses of the Buddha, a seminal collection of early Buddhist texts.  The Digha is part of the scripture of the Theravada school of Buddhism.  The Theravada school is is the oldest surviving form of Buddhism and is still practiced in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Burma, and elsewhere.  Together with other forms of Buddhism, Theravada has attracted a great deal of interest in the West, and this book will be invaluable in making its teachings accessible.  This collection of discourses is considered canonical by all other schools of Buddhism.  Subsequent understanding of the Buddha's teachings built upon it, even when they seemed to depart from it.<br />The Digha is a collection of 34 discourses (suttas), originally written in Pali.  The form of the teaching differs from that of later Buddhist teachings in that in the Digha, the Buddha is presented as a person wandering through India and teaching his disciples, followers of other sects, kings, princes, gods, and anyone who is open to listen.  The teachings are difficult but the emphasis in this collection is on psychology more than metaphysics.  The Buddha described his dhamma as designed to end suffering and to teach people how to be happy.  That is the core of this volume.<br />Many scholars believe that the Digha was written specifically to introduce the Buddha's teaching to lay followers.  Most (but not all) the suttas in the collection involve discussions between the Buddha and various lay people or followers of other sects.  The suttas in the collection include a great deal of mythology and story-telling.  These factors, together with the content of the discourses, tend to show it was designed for a large audience, rather than only for close followers of the Buddha's teachings.  They remain an outstanding source for those wanting to make a serious effort to study the Buddha.<br />Many of the Suttas in the collection present important expositions of the Buddha's dhamma (teaching). The first sutta in the collection, translated here as &quot;What the Teaching is Not&quot; is basic but difficult.  The reader coming to the Digha might want to begin with the second sutta, &quot;The Fruits of the Homeless Life&quot;.  This sutta is widely studied and is a beautiful exposition of the Buddha's teaching and its value.<br />Sutta 15 of the collection, the &quot;Great Discourse on the Origination&quot; is the most detailed single discussion in the Pali Canon of the Buddha's fundamental and uncompromisingly difficult teaching on dependent origination -- impermanence, selflessness, and interconnectedness.  Sutta 22, &quot;The Greater Discourse on the Foundation of Mindfulness&quot; is the basic meditation sutta which should be studied by those wishing to develop a meditation practice.  Sutta 16, the longest sutta in the Pali Canon, tells the story of the Buddha's last days and of his passing.  In it the Buddha exhorts his followers to &quot;strive on with diligence&quot; to achieve their goal of enlightenment.  Sutta 31, the Sigala Sutta, differs markedly from the remaining suttas in the collection in that it consists of the Buddha's rather worldy advice to a worldly young man.<br />I have the good fortune to belong to a Sutta Study group led by an able teacher where for the past year or so (the group has been meeting much longer) we have explored this collection in depth.  We generally have one person assigned to lead the discussion of a Sutta (our group averages about ten) and we all read and discuss it over a two-hour session.  (The longer, more difficult suttas require several sessions.)  This is an ideal way to study the text.  If such a group is unavailable to you, the best way to proceed, I think, is to read the collection slowly -- do not try to rush or to do it at once -- concentrate on the sections that seem to speak to you and go back to them.  This is a text that is not meant to convey history or dogma but to encourage reflection, meditation and study.<br />The translation of the text is by Maurice Walshe, a scholar and a distinguished Buddhist lay practioner who also translated the works of the Christian mystic, Meister Eckhardt.  Walshe wrote a useful introduction covering key Buddhist concepts, a summary of each sutta, and brief notes.  His translation is homespun,  colloquial, and accessible.  It serves its function of allowing the reader to approach the text and the Dhamma.<br />Walshe and Wisdom Publications have done great service in making this volume available to interested readers in the West. (Wisdom has also published companion volumes of the Middle-Length Discourses and the Connected Discourses.)  This is a difficult book but will repay the effort many times.

The book is an excellent study of the role artillery played both for the Union and for the Confederacy in the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1 -- July 3, 1863).  Although the most potent weapon in the Civil War was the foot soldier and infantry, artilery was a feared and dreadful weapon and was of critical importance to the outcome of the Battle of Gettysburg.  Downey's study is nearly 50 years old, but it remains of great value to those wishing to understand Gettysburg and the role of the artillery.  More general studies of the battle tend to give too little attention to the artillery.<br />Downey's book includes good information on the various forms of artillery weaponry, including Civil-War era drawings and models.  The appendix to the book includes a list of artillery weaponry in use at Gettysburg and their capabilities, U.S. army regulations explaining the use of artilery, and the reports on the Battle of Gettysburg submitted by Generals Henry Hunt and William Pendelton, the chiefs of artiillery for the Union and the Confederacy.<br />The greater part of the book is devoted to an examination of each of the three days of the Battle with a discussion of how each side used -- or misused -- artillery.  The discussion of the first day of the Battle focuses on the support Lieutenant  John Calef's battery offered to the leader of the Union cavalry, John Burford, in the opening stages of the conflict.  Then in the afternoon portion of the first day's battle, Downey discusses the heroics of Captain Hubert Dilger of the Federal XIth Corps whose bravery helped slow the Confederate onslaught on day 1 and allow the Union troops to retreat in safety.<br />In the second day of the Battle, Downey discusses the actions Lieutenant Charles Hazlett, whose troops and horses successfuly brought thier guns up the rocky slope of Little Round Top to help stem a fierce Confederate attack.  At the Peach Orchard, Downey describes the actions of the Ninth Massachusetts and Captain John Bigelow whose isolated battery resisted a strong Confederate onslaught and bought precious minutes for Union reinforcements.  Downey also describes the artillery battle at Culp's hill on the right side of the Union line and the heroic but doomed efforts of the Confederate &quot;boy major&quot;, Joseph Latimer, in his opening artillery attack from Benner's Hill.<br />The book devotes a great deal of attention to the Southern cannonade that proceeded Pickett's charge on the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg.  Most students of the battle know that much of the Confederate cannonade overshot its intended mark and was relatively ineffective.  But Downey explains as well how the positioning of the Confederate artillery was faulty (and how the South failed to use all its available guns) and how its fire failed to concentrate on those portions of the Union forces that could do the impending infantry assault the most damage.  This was a clear and valuable treatment of a matter I did not understand before reading this book.<br />The single most impressive figure in this book is General John Hunt, the Union's head artillerist.  Hunt was courageous and cool under pressure.  He seemed to cover the entire battlefield during the three days and was able to have his guns and reinforcements in the right place and in the nick of time.  Confederate Colonel Porter Alexander, chief of artillery for Longstreet, also receives deserved high praise.<br />Downey points out the fortitude shown by artillerists for both the North and the South, while emphasizing the North's superiority in weaponry, numbers, discipline, and shot.  Probably most importantly, the Union effectively coordinated its artillery efforts during the Battle, while the Confederacy, following the pattern for the Battle as a whole, was unable to do so in its efforts.<br />This book does notexplore broad political or military issues of the American Civil War or even of the Battle of Gettysburg.  But it tells an important part of the story of Gettysburg objectively and eloquently. Downey writes with an obvious knowledge and love of his chosen subject. This is an essential book for those readers with a burning desire to learn as much as they can about the Battle of Gettysburg.explore broad political or military issues of the American Civil War or even of the Battle of Gettysburg.

Reading the book, I think, will encourage the reader to explore further the inexhaustible richness of Beethoven's music.<br />Lookwood concentrates on Beethoven's compositions and on their historical and musical contexts. He does not offer a full biography of Beethoven but rather offers only sufficient broad outline of Beethoven's life to give a sense of the composer and to allow the reader to reflect upon the relationship between the life of Beethoven and his music.  Lookwood himself has some interesting things to say on various views of this relationship. (pp 17-21)<br />Lockwood sees Mozart and Bach as Beethoven's primary musical influences.  As a young composer, Beethoven both set out to  learn from Mozart without becoming an imitator.  His early works are greatly influence by Mozart, Lockwood argues, until Beethoven breaks away and finds his own voice in what Lockwood terms Beethoven's second maturity.  As Beethoven continued to compose, his work becomes more influenced by the counterpoint of Bach.  (Beethoven had played Bach's &quot;well-tempered clavier&quot; as a boy of twelve.) Bach's influence becomes increasingly apparent in the close-textured and fugal works of Beethoven's third maturity.<br />Lockwood basically organizes his book in terms of what he describes as Beethoven's first, second and third maturities of musical development.  In each case, he begins with brief details of Beethoven's life, followed by a substantial overview of Beethoven's work and influences in each period, followed by a description of some of the major individual works of the period.  For the period of Beethoven's first maturity, Lockwood finds the apex of Beethovens' work in the six opus 18 string quartets.<br />For Beethoven's first and third maturity Loockwood approaches the works chronologically.  Interestingly, for the second maturity, Lockwood organizes Beethoven's work by type: the symphonies, concertos, piano sonatas, string quartets, etc, to account for Beethoven's tendency during this time to work on many various compositions simultaneously.<br />Some of the individual works receive little discussion in Lockwood's approach, but this is more than balanced by his excellent overviews of Beethoven's varying styles.  Of the early and middle maturity works, Lockwood discusses well Beethoven's third through eighth symphonies, particularly the Eroica.  But he does not see Beethoven's work at this time as predominantly &quot;heroic&quot; in tone.  Unlike some writers, Lockwood gives good attention to Beethoven's lyrical, melodic, and reflective writing during his second maturity as exemplified by the even-numbered symphonies and by works such as the violin concerto and the cello sonata in A, opus 69. Loockwood emphasies as well the lyrical aspect of Beethoven's writing in his detailed consideration of Beethoven's song-cycle &quot;An Die Ferne Geliebte&quot; (to the distant beloved), opus. 98 (pp.344-46)and in his discussion of Beethoven's songs. (pp 274-279).<br />The compositions of Beethoven's third maturity receive the most individualized and detailed attention in this book.  Lookwood considers at some length the Hammerklavier piano sonata and the opus 101 piano sonata (somewhat less attention is given to the final three sonatas), the Missa Solemnis, Diabelli variations, and to each of the five final string quartets and to the great fugue.  Lockwood clearly loves this difficult music and impresses its character well upon the reader.  But he gives his fullest discussion to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.  Lookwood gives a detailed musical discussion of each ofthe four movements of this work, not merely its choral finale which sets Schiller's &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;; and he places the work well in its historical situation. He admirably rejects the attempts in some modern writers to policticize or deconstruct this great symphony.<br />In the Ninth, Lockwood shows, Beethoven combined two tendencies which tend to separate in some of his works:  his tendency to write works to appeal to a large public on the one hand, and his tendency to write artistically elevated and striving works on the other hand.  Lockwood's treatment of the Ninth is one of the highlights of his book.<br />Lockwood has written a basic book, but probably the best overall book that will increase the reader's understanding of Beethoven and his music.

This was the critical, pivotal aspect of the Battle of Gettysburg and probably has more claim to be denominated the &quot;high-water mark of the Confederacy&quot; than does Pickett's charge on July 3.<br />Pfanz offers a wealth of information and detail in presenting this confusing and complicated day of Battle.  His story begins with a brief review of the Confederate invasion of the North and of the Union Army of the Potomac's successful attempt to shadow Lee and follow him into Pennsylvania.  He describes General Meade assuming control of the Union Army on June 28, 1863, and his efforts to concentrate the dispersed Union forces to meet the Confederate threat.  He spends substantial time, as he must, discussing the placement and movement of the two armies and the strategies adopted by both Meade and Lee following the fighting on July 1.  He stresses, properly, how each commander lacked essential information about the activities of the enemy.<br />There is a thorough discussion of the deployment of the troops on July 2, particularly of Union General Sickles near-disastrous placement of his Third Corps in front of the rest of the Union line. He discusses judiciously and well the disagreements between Lee and Longstreet over the course to be pursued on day 2.  Following these lengthy preliminaries, most of the book discusses the fierce fighting on the Union left from about 4:00 to 7:00 p.m. on July 2, including the action at Devils' Den, Little Round Top, the Wheatfield, the Peach Orchard, the Union Center, and the ultimate repulse of the Confederate advance.<br />The detail of the book is convincing but sometimes is cluttered.  In Dr. Pfanz's account, it is frequently difficult to separate the essential from the detail.  Most of the account is given over to discussions of individual actions and individual company and brigade commanders.  The is substantial attention to individual soldiers and units which, again, occasionaly interferes with the broad picture.  There are biographies of virtually every commander at the level of General as well as of many soldiers of lesser rank.<br />There was a factual omission that struck me: Dr. Pfanz does not mention the mortal wounding of Confederate General Dorsey Pender, a Division commander in Hill's Corps.  Pender was preparing to lead his troops in an attack on the Union center in support of the attack by Anderson's troops when he was felled.  I have seen many accounts of the fighting on the second day that contend that the mortal wounding of Pender was critical to the ultimate result of the Confederate attack on the Union center on day 2.  Perhaps these accounts overstate the case, but I am surprised Dr. Pfanz did not mention it.<br />This is not an account for beginning students of the Battle of Gettysburg, but it is essential for those who are ready to and interested in exploring the Battle in detail.  Further, the book is narrowly focused and makes little attempt to integrate the Battle of Gettysburg into the broader military history of the Civil War, much less into the political and social history of the times.

Board of Education.  At the time the book was written, little public attention was given to the role of African-Americans in the Civil War.  This situation changed dramatically only with the movie &quot;Glory&quot; which brought the charge of African-American troops on Fort Wagner, South Carolina in July, 1863 (days after the Battle of Gettysburg and the fall of Vicksburg) into public consciousness.<br />In some respects, including its terminology and writing style, Quarles's book shows its age.  But the book remains an excellent introduction to the many ways in which African-Americans participated in the Civil War.  In its understanding of the causes and results of the War, the book still has a great deal  to teach the reader today.<br />In the eloquent &quot;Foreward&quot; to the book, Quarles describes the Civil War as an immediate consequence of the institution of slavery.  This is an important insight, and it was not the most commonly accepted view of the Civil War in 1953.  (It is still debated today.)  Quarles also takes a very positive view of the United States and of the ability of the American people to realize and reshape the ideals that were partially expressed in our country's founding documents and to work to realize the liberty of all people within our nation.  He views the Civil War struggle and the role of African-Americans within it as imbued with patriotism and idealism.  He takes a hopeful view of the ability of our country to move forward and implement its ideals.  Quarles thus explains eloquently how the Civil War remains highly important in understanding the United States and where it is going.<br />The book covers the military, political, and social history of African-Americans in the Civil War.  By the end of the War, African-Americans comprised approximately 8% of the Union Army. Quarles describes the role of African-American soldiers in the Battles of Fort Wagner, mentioned above, Petersburg, Wilson's Landing, Nashville, and Milliken's Bend.  (He is very short with Fort Pillow and the massacre of African-American soldiers by troops of Nathan Bedford Forrest).  The book covers the recruitment of the African-American troops, their enthusiasm and commitment, and makes clear the great role they played in the War effort.<br />The book includes an excellent study of the President Lincoln's actions culminating in the Emancipation Proclamation in making the end of slavery an express goal of the War.  He also describes how, in 1863, the conduct of the War changed from a relatively limited conflict aimed at supressing the succession effort to a total war with the goal of changing the fabric of American society.  There is considerable emphasis on General Sherman and his destructive march though Georgia and South Carolina.<br />There is fascinating material in the book about African-American schools before and during the Civil War era.  Quarles describes well how African-Americans in both the North and the South were eager to learn and to study to make their way as free people within the United States.  There is good discussion too of African-American societies and organizations and political leaders in the United States during the War years. Much of this information may still be relatively unfamiliar to many readers.<br />Commendably, Quarles describes as well the efforts many African-Americans made in the South in support of the Confederate war effort.  This effort may be slighted in modern studies. While many slaves crossed the lines and escaped from slavery as the Union armies advanced, others remained loyal to the South.  Both free African-Americans and those held as slaves contributed money and services to the South's war effort. Just weeks before the end of the War, the South decided to accept African-American soldiers in its armies and offered manumission to those who would participate in the war effort.  Of course, by the time it reached this decision, it made little difference to the outcome of the war.<br />This book remains a basic source for those wishing to understand the African-American Civil War experience and African-American history.o would participate in the war effort.

The writing style is varied and superb, the pace of the novel carefully controlled, and the characters live from the inside.  The book explores many large themes, the nature of guilt and atonement, tne nature of love, the nature of the writing of fiction, war, social change and social classes, and many others. The variety and breadth of these themes could easliy produce a sprawling, confused work.  But in \\"Atonement\\" the themes are carefully controlled and integrated.<br />The book begins on an English upper-middle class estate in 1935. The protagonist is a 13 year-old precocious girl, Briony Tallis, who already has the ambition to be a writer.  She witnesses an erotic flirtation between her older sister Cecilia Tallis, and Robbie Turner, a brilliant young man from an underprivileged backround (and of uncertain paternity) whose education has been sponsored by Briony's father.  The plot unfolds slowly and inexorably with great descriptive detail and attention to character.  At the conclusion of the first section Briony makes a false accusation against Robbie which results in Robbie's imprisonment.  The rest of the book is the working-out of this carefully-laid opening chapter.<br />The outstanding features of this novel include the change of voicing and of pacing in each of the four sections. Each of the first three parts of the book are written in the third person but the voicing in each section is significanly and purposefully different.<br />The first and longest section, which I have discussed above, is written in the tone of the omniscent narrator -- one assumes it is the voice of the novelist unfolding his story.  The second section of the book is set early in WW II with the British evacuation of France at Dunkirk just prior to the German air attack on Brittain.  The story continues in the third person, but the pace and drive of the story increases rapidly.  We are witnessing the British troups on their retreat to Dunkirk with the horrors of battle.  The story is written, we soon learn, in the voice of Robbie Turner, who has been released from prison on condition that he enlist in the war effort.<br />The third chapter is set in London just before the air raids.  We meet Briony Tallis again who is full of remorse for her false testimony years before against Robbie.  Briony is becoming a nurse, (her sister Cecelia is also a nurse) and there are gripping scenes of wounded and dying men in the hospital returning from combat. There are some wonderful secondary characters in this section, including Sister Drummond, the supervisor of the young probationer nurses, and Mrs.Jarvis, a crusty British landlord in the best Victorian tradition.  In this section of the book, we learn that Briony is continuing her efforts to write and she is also seeking forgiveness for the guilty deed of her girlhood.  As the chapter progresses, we see that it is written from the perspective of Briony herself even though it continues in the third person.<br />The final section of the book is set in 1999 and is very short.  The voicing shifts again, this time to the first person, and the story and the novel achieve a difficult closure.<br />This novel is ultimately a careful, well-crafted and reflective work which speaks eloquently of the power of writing to transform reality and of the still more important power of human love.ps on their retreat to Dunkirk with the horrors of battle.

This volume, \\"Gettysburg, Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill\\" (1993) covers the fighting on the Union right -- Confederate left part of the line.  This aspect of the Battle has not received the attention that has been accorded to Pickett's charge or to Longstreet's assault on the Union left on July 2. But it is an important and interesting component of the Battle nonetheless.  Further, Culp and Cemetery Hills were the only parts of the battlefield that saw sustained action during all three days of the fighting.<br />Pfanz begins, as the story must, with several chapters on the first day of the battle, July 1, 1863.  The first day reached its climax with a Confederate victory north and west of Gettysburg which pushed two Union Corps, the first and the eleventh, through the town and unto Cemetery Hill south of town.  Cemetery Hill and the adjacent Culp's Hill were crucial to the defense of the entire Union line on Cemetery Ridge.  Pfanz' book discusses at length the Confederate failure to pursue the attack on day 1 and to attempt to take these two hills.  Pfanz concludes that the Confederate corps commander, Lietenant General Richard Ewell, was probably not at fault by failing to attack and try to take these hills on July 1.  This pivotal moment of the Battle is a subject of endless debate among students of Gettysburg.<br />Pfanz also describes in detail the fighting for Cemetery and Culp hills during the evening of July 2, after the Union had heavily occupied and fortified them. Pfanz also offers a good discussion of skirmishing and of fighting in the town of Gettysburg itself -- again a matter that sometimes receives too little attention in other studies.  Pfanz' account of the fighting for the hills focuses on the vagaries of battle and of the tremendous cost in human lives and suffering of the war.  He points out that the Union basically committed errors involving both Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill that made the positions highly vulnerable.  The Confederates fought valiantly but were unable to capture either hill due to the inherent strength of the defensive positions, lack of coordination, mistakes of their own, and fierce Union defense.  The Confederates did capture some fortifications on Culp's hill, but were forced to abandon them on July 3.  This leads to the third part of Pfanz' story.<br />On July 3, General Robert E. Lee wanted to coordinate a resumption of the attack on the Union right with a new attack on the Union center and left -- which ultimately became Pickett's charge.  But the fighting on the Union right came and went before the action in the center of the line began.  There was fierce fighting on Culp's hill beginning with a Union artillery bombardment at dawn and continuing until 11:00 that morning.  The Confederates attacked the Union defenses repeatedly but were repulsed each time with heavy losses.<br />Pfanz tells his story well and the book is full of detail about the participants, from the generals to the foot soldiers. His account strives to be full and objective and probably could have used more in the way of commentary and analysis.  The book is not suitable for the reader with a casual interest in the Battle of Gettysburg or for someone coming to the Battle for the first time.  For such readers, a good general account of the Battle would be more suitable.

The first part of the book, titled &quot;Courage's War&quot; covers the early years of the war to about mid-1863 (the time of the climactic Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg). During these years, Linderman sees the primary motivating factor of the war as courage and of individual effort.  The soldier enlisting in the war effort -- and during the early years volunteers bore the overwhelming brunt of the effort- had concepts of personal bravery in the face of danger, fearlessness and commitment to duty and to a purpose.  He believed that the actions of an individual mattered and could make a difference to the result of a battle.  This was an idealistic concept and Linderman shows well how it was reinforced and complemented by concepts of manliness, comradeship, godliness and morality, chivalry, and the brotherhood of soldiers, which assumes a certain degree of respect for the enemy on the other side of the line. Linderman points out that the Civil War may have been the last conflict in which these ideals were taken seriously.  They were dashed in WW I, and in the later phases of the Civil War itself.<br />The second part of the book, titled &quot;A Perilous Education&quot; shows how the initial idealism underlying the soldiers' war effort became hardened and tarnished with the stark reality of combat. The concept of courage didn't disappear but it changed and the soldiers became tougher and more realistic.  On occasion cynicism and disilusion set in. The factors leading to this change in perspective were the horrors and deaths on the battlefield, reulting largely from the increased range of Civil War weaponry which helped make the traditional offensive charge (as at Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, and Cold Harbor) ineffective and death-dealing to the agressor.  Other factors include the crude Civil War hospitals, with blood and amputation on every side, the long forced marches, the toll of disease in the camps, which led to twice as many deaths as did combat, the boredom of camp life, imprisionment in camps such as Andersonville,  the lengthy character of the war, the confiict between volunteers and draftees, and the lack of food and supplies which led soldiers to &quot;forage&quot; from civilians and to strip valuables and clothes from the bodies of dead comrades and enemies.  The civil war became a total, brutal war in the final two years.  Stonewall Jackson early in the war, and Grant and Sherman subsequently, understood the total nature of the effort that was required to pursue this war.<br />The idealism with which the volunteers entered the war and their concept of individual effort changed radically when faced with the harshness of the war.  This changed their understanding of themselves, the war effort, and their relationship to the civilian population.<br />There is a lengthy &quot;epilogue' to the book which discusses the fate of the concept of courage following the war and how it evolved through the end of the 19th century.  Broadly speaking, a certain nostalgia set in beginning in the 1880's when the original ideals of courage revived in memory and the hardships of the war effort receded.<br />Lindererman's book is well documented with contemporaneous accounts from the soldiers and with subsequent memoirs.  It taught me a great deal about motivation in combat and how it changes with experience.  Those interested in pursuing the subject further might be interested in James McPherson's &quot;For Cause and Comrades&quot;, which takes issue with Linderman on certain points, and in David Blight's &quot;Race and Reunion&quot;.  The latter book develops the theme sketched in Linderman's epilogue by showing the effects of time on how people in the United States perceived the conflictof 1861 - 1865.t of 1861 - 1865.	2003-12-19
US	48185764	R1K1GJ0UMNYJ82	0764306189	906025806	Firestorm at Gettysburg: Civilian Voices June-November 1863	Books	3	8	8	N	N	The Story of Civilians at Gettysburg	The subject of &quot;Firestorm at Gettysburg&quot; by Jim Slade and John Alexander (1998) is civilian life in the town of Gettysburg before, during, and after the great battle of July 1-3,1863.  The book describes well the impact of the battle on the local population of Gettysburg.  This is an important and sometimes overlooked component of the history of the Battle of Gettysburg.<br />In many respects, this book is good and informative.  Slade and Alexander draw broadly on contemporary accounts of the effect of the Battle of Gettysburg on civilians.  The book opens with a good summary &quot;Gettysburg and Some of her Citizens&quot; which introduces the reader to many of the residents of the town who left accounts of their experiences during the Battle.  The book describes briefly the pre-Civil War history of Gettysburg, its demographics, and its economic base.  Again, this is an often neglected subject and I found the treatment of it here brief but informative.  The book covers the Gettysburg campaign, including Jubal Early's foray through Gettysburg one week before the Battle of Gettysburg itself commenced.  It then covers each of the three days of the battle and follows- up the battle with a treatment of events in the town during the Confederate retreat and its aftermath.  Its discussion of the hardships involved in burying the dead and of the efforts of the Sanitary and Christian Commissions to take care of the wounded in the months following the battle was for me the most informative part of the book.<br />I thought the book helped me to get to know the people of Gettysburg and to see how they interacted with the Union and Confederate military forces during the Battle.  The book paints a picture of fear -- understandable given the horrors of the battle - and of the real dangerc faced by the civilian populace during these tumultous days. But there are also many scenes showing how the soldiers and the townspeople learned to cooperate with and at least try to understand one another in the difficult situation that was thrust upon both the soldiers and the civilians.<br />There are many photographs in the book, of the battle,military leaders, civilians and of places in Gettysburg and its environs that help the reader visualize the town of Gettysburg in the 1860s  and that will give the imaginative reader a feel for the town and for the impact of the Battle.<br />The major problems with the book are the many errors of fact it contains and the many typographical errors which suggest carelessness and unreliability. Most of these factual errors and typos are individually small but, as often happens, the reader with some familiarity with Gettysburg will find them distracting.  Some photographs in particular are misidentified.  Many pictures of dead soldiers following the battle are identified in the book as deriving from McPherson's Ridge, the site of the fighting on July 1.  In fact, recent scholarship places the sites of these  photographs at Devil's Den or the Rose Farm on the opposite side of the battlefield, several miles away from McPherson's Ridge and the scenes of major fighting on July 2.  This again is not a large point in itself, given the theme of the book;  but it does tend to suggest a lack of familiarity in the authors with recent Gettysburg studies. It weakens the value of the book as a source rather than as a casual read.<br />Slade and Alexander don't seem to have looked at their subject critically.  The book basically consists of a patching -together of various eyewitness reports with no effort to synthesize or explain. Because of the episodic nature of the presentation, it is sometimes difficult to follow a character from one scene to the other.  The book doesn't offer a good narrative flow or allow the reader to think through to any conclusions from the material presented.<br />In summary, this book has its merits and will encourage the reader to focus on the human side of the Battle of Gettysburg rather than simply on the events of the combat. The book is good for casual reading and the many photographs will stimulate reflection.  The book, unfortunately, is inadequate as a historical account.  It will not serve well the reader interested in a detailed, accurate treatment of the Battle of Gettysburg and the local civilian population.han simply on the events of the combat.

These photographers included Alexander Gardner of Philadelphia, who began photographing the Battlefield on July 7 or 8, 1863, the famous Matthew Brady, the Tyson Brothers, portrait photographers who lived in Gettysburg, and others.  Their photographs were arranged in series and sold in various formats to the American public which was eager to learn about the War.<br />Over the years, the photographs have been misidentified, placed out of sequence and, in some instances, forgotten.  William Frassinto's &quot;Gettyburg, a Journey in Time&quot; (1975) was among the first books to recapture this photographic legacy, to study the scenes and the makers of the pictures, and to organize his material in a book for the modern reader.  Mr. Frassinto has since published a number of sequels to this inital book as well as a study of photographers at Antietam.<br />The book consists of approximately 100 photographs, most of them dating from shortly after the battle in July, 1863 through 1866.  There are also a number of photographs that Mr. Frassinto himself took dating from the late 1960s and early 1970s. These photos allow the reader to compare the original scenes with the current state of the Gettysburg Battlefield.<br />After a short discussion giving biographical information on the photographers and information on their visits to Gettysburg, Mr Frassanito presents and discusses the photographs themselves.  His presentation is arranged in six groups: 1. the first day's battle (north and west of the town); 2. Cemetery Hill; 3. Culp's Hill; 4. Cemetery Ridge; 5.  Little Round Top and Devil's Den; 6. the Rose Farm.<br />Mr. Frassanito introduces each group with a short description of the significance of the site.  He then discusses each picture in detail, explaining when it was taken, what it shows, and its importance to the Battle of Gettysburg.  The photographs are themselves eloquent and compelling and their effect is heightened by Mr Frassanito's commentary.  I came away understanding the first day's battle and the fighting on Culp's Hill and Cemetry Hill on the Union right much better as a result of Mr. Frassanito's account and the photographs.<br />The most famous photographs in the book are probably those of the dead soldiers (in a few cases the photos were taken of live soldiers posing as dead for the photographers) on Little Round Top and on the Rose Farm.  Most of these photographs were taken by Gardner because the dead were removed from the Battlefield relatively quickly after the battle.  Gardner moved from south to north on the Battlefield and captured the few instances in which the dead had not yet been buried.  The photos capture the terrible costs of the Battle.<br />Many of Gardner's photos have been erroneously identified over the years as originating from the first day's fighting on McPherson's ridge.  Mr. Frassanito explains how he determined these photographs in fact originated on Rose Hill, on the southern part of the Battlefield. (The first day fighting was on the northenmost part of the Battlefield.)  Yet misidentifications die hard.  I have seen books which postdate Mr. Frassanito's which continue to attribute these photographs to the first day of the fighting.<br />The photos and the text in this book will give the reader a good sense of the tragedy and cost of this seminal battle.

His novel, &#34;The Human Stain&#34; is both entertaining and thought-provoking. It is a worthy addition to American fiction of the early 21st century.<br /><br />The title of the book sets forth its primary theme. A major part of human life is tied to human sexuality and to physicality. People ignore or downplay this aspect at their peril. This theme is reflected throughout the book. Roth, even more than John Updike and with a different perspective than Updike, writes with a passion about the central role of sexuality in human life.<br /><br />The story unfolds against a backdrop of the Clinton impeachment hearings. The chief protagonist of the book is Coleman Silk, a 71 year old former professor of Classics and Dean of a small New England College. Silk has resigned from the college as a result of an investigation over a classroom remark that some found racist. His wife of many years has died, and Silk has become romantically involved with a 34 year-old divorced woman with little education who works as a janitor in the college. Silk's former colleagues, his four children and his acquaintances are leery of his affair. Silk befriends Nathan Zukerman, an alter ego who appears in many Roth novels, who tells Silk's story.<br /><br />Silk has become highly successful but has done so in part by denying important components of his life. He is of African-American ancestry but light enough to pass. (Many American novels utilize the theme of &#34;passing&#34; for white.) He callously walks away from his family at the age of 27 in order to marry a white woman for fear that she would reject him if she were aware of his ancestry. He never reveals the secret. Roth's book suggests in a poignant way how difficult it is for one person to claim to know another.<br /><br />The theme of individual self-determination in life choices, as opposed to following the course of the group into which one was born, is another major theme of the book. Roth develops it well, with all its pain and ambiguity, in exploring the choices Zuckerman has made. Many people probably would assert that people need to stay and develop within their group. This isn't Roth. He seems to me more quintessentially American by celebrating the room modern secular democracy gives people to change and follow their stars. But, very simply, this is a different matter from denying one's origins altogether.<br /><br />The book is full of great scenes, particularly of Coleman Silk's early fascination with boxing, and of literary allusions. There are allusions to Homer and Euripides, as befitting a professor of classics. Euripides, with his naturalism and recognition of the power of sexuality, is an excellent choice for emphasis in this book. There are also fine passages emphasizing the power of music, including a lovely description of Coleman's 19-year old lover, when he was young, dancing in his college flat. Mahler's music, with its feel for the earth, also figures prominently as does the powerhouse pianist, Yefim Bronfman.<br /><br />Coleman's 34 year old lover is well described. She helps teach Coleman, very late in his life, the importance of sexuality and of human contact, to try to see and accept things for what they are, and to understand the inevitability of change.<br /><br />Readers who enjoy this book might also enjoy Saul Bellow's novel, &#34;Ravelstein&#34; which raises many of the same issues. Bellow's novel tells the story of a philosophy professor who, like Silk, specializes in the ancient Greeks -- Plato rather than Euripides. Both books are narrated by a friends of the protagonists who are novelists and who request them to write narratives to remember their lives. Both involve stories of sexual passion and speak of the promises and difficulties offered in the United States where people can, in a real sense, become who they are. Roth's novel and Bellow's novel, the products of two of our finest writers in their old age, present good pictures of the potential of American life in our modern day.come who they are.

This book, the last of the volumes to be written, covers the opening day of the great battle, July 1, 1863. For many people, the fighting on the first day tends to be overshadowed by events such as the struggle for Little Round Top on July 2 and Pickett's Charge on July 3. But the first day was critical to the progress of the Battle of Gettysburg. Without an understanding of day 1, the interested student cannot fully grasp the events which followed on the second and third days and their aftermath.<br /><br />Pfanz gives a very brief account of the reasons underlying the Confederacy's decision to invade the North following the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, 1863. He also is very short in describing the early stages of the invasion and Stuart's ill-conceived cavalry ride around the Union rear. But his account of day one of the battle itself and of the course of the fighting is full and outstanding.<br />I have found the events of July 1 difficult to follow in reading earlier studies. This is because, I think, the meeting between the two armies was unplanned and unexpected. Neither Union nor Confederacy expected to fight a major battle at Gettysburg. When the armies stumbled into each other, activities on both sides were improvised. There were a number of different fights at different times and different locations on the field and a lack of coordination. It is important to keep in mind the different units of each army involved and the different times and locations on the field.<br /><br />Pfanz develops his story slowly and tries to present an integrated, cohesive account. He begins with the meeting between Buford's cavalry in the early morning of July 1, followed by lengthy discussions of the fighting between the Union First Corps and Heth's Division of Hill's Corps to the West and Northwest of the town and of the fighting between the Union 11th Corps and Ewell's Division to the North of the town. His account is less critical of the activities of the Eleventh Corps than are many other accounts of July 1, 1863.<br /><br />Pfanz pays attention to leadership -- or its overall lack during the first day of the fighting -- and focuses on the troops on the ground. The fighting brigades and their leaders get a great deal of attention. There are excellent maps and descriptions on the maps which lead the reader step-by-step through the key encounters on day 1. The book is enlivened by many human interest stories and histories of the participants. Pfanz draws many insightful parallels, comparisons and contrasts, between the fighting on day 1 and some of the events which followed on days 2 and 3.<br /><br />Students of Gettysburg have long debated whether the Confederacy could have gained a decisive victory if it had followed-up its initial success and attempted to occupy Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill after it had driven the Union army through Gettysburg. Pfanz studies this question carefully and shows the difficulties and uncertainties that General Ewell would have faced if he had decided to mount a further attack. Pfanz offers a thoughtful, sobering discussion of an important question about the battle.<br /><br />This book is not for the beginning student of the Battle of Gettysburg. It presupposes a certain familiarity with the battle as a whole and with its ebb and flow over the three days. For those readers who have a basic grasp of the battle and a desire to learn about the events of day 1 in detail, Pfanz' study is an indispensable source.<br /><br />Robin FriedmanNorthwest of the town and of the fighting between the Union 11th Corps and Ewell's Division to the North of the town.

This book with paintings by the Civil War artist Mort Kunstler is special because it is an attempt to recreate the Battle of Gettysburg through the eyes of an artist. Kunstler is a renowned painter of American historical subjects who focuses on the Civil War.  He first visited Gettysburg in 1988.<br />In 1992, the National Park Service was inspired to diplay a series of Kunstler's paintings at Gettysburg. This was apparently the first instance in which the Park had used an art exhibition to help explain the theme of the Battle.  Kunstler has said of his Gettysburg paintings that they constituted &quot;the most difficult project' of his career.<br />This book of paintings was published in 1993 to coincide with the motion picture &quot;Gettysburg.&quot;  Good art has a life of its own beyond its connection with a film venture, and this book does.<br />The book includes a running text by historian James McPherson explaining, in a clear and simple way,  the basics of the Battle of Gettysburg.  But the real attraction of the book lies in Kunstler's paintings.  I would suggest reading the book through a first time with McPherson's commentary and then turning one's attention to the paintings.  (There is an index of the paintings at the end of the book.)<br />There are approximately 60 paintings in the book which cover virtually every significant aspect of the Battle and many of its protagonists.  The book begins with Lee's invasion of Pennsylvania and has several excellent paintings of his army passing through town and countryside en route to what would become an epic battle.  There are pictures of the fighting of each of the three days.  I was pleased that the book included several paintings of the first day of the battle, including an excellent picture of Union Cavalry Commander Burford spending a restless night of pacing before what would become the onset of the Battle.  On the second day, the book features Joshua Chamberlain and Little Round Top with a very good painting as well of Barksdale's charge.  There are many paintings of Pickett's charge, from both sides of the field, and paintings of the Confederate retreat from Pennsylvania. There is also an outstanding large-scale painting of the cavalry battle on the third day between Stuart and Custer, which sometimes is overlooked. The book concludes with a portrait of Lincoln at Gettysburg delivering his famous address.<br />The characters portrayed in the paintings include Lee, Longstreet, Stuart, Pickett (and this three brigade commanders Armistead, Garnett, and Kemper) and Barksdale.  Union portrayals include Lincoln, Reynolds, Burford, and Chamberlain. (There are no portraits of Meade, the Union commander, or of Hancock.)<br />The cumulative effect of the paintings is impressive.  The paintings evidence a good deal of study and give a good account of uniforms, terrain, and the topography of the Battlefield.  for the most part, the paintings avoid the sentimentality that frequently accompanies this type of art.  Some of the paintings, such as the painting of Burford that I mentioned above, the painting of the meeting between Lee and Stuart, the painting of Lee greeting his men after Pickett's failed charge, and the paintings showing the hardship of the Confederate retreat following the Battle seem to me particularly well done.  They suggest well and creatively the significance of the Battle.<br />I have some reservations about this form of genre art.  But this book captures much of the Battle of Gettysburg and will provoke thought and reflection among its viewers of the significance of this moment.  The book combines artistic imagination and a sense of American history.

These goals are at the heart of Buddhism and of the Diamond Sutra.  The Diamond Sutra is a seminal text of Mahayana Buddhism probably written about 350 A.D.  The work is written in difficult, deliberately paradoxical terms.  It encourages the reader to change his or her outlook by understanding the evanescent, changing, illusory character of what we take in our ordinary moments to be fixed reality.  The Diamond Sutra tries to get the reader to let go of fixed concepts, of ideology, of selfishness, and to work towards a transformation to true wisdom and understanding and compassion for others.  The Diamond Sutra also asks us to rethink our concept of a religious text.  In the West, most people tend to see Scripture as specific teachings reflective in some sense of a Divine command.  The Diamond Sutra and Buddhist teachings generally follow the Buddha's famous simile of the raft.  The teachings are means to lead the reader to understanding -- or to the other side-- rather than ends or doctrines to be followed in their own right.  When a person has attained enlightenment -- a rare occurence -- the teachings of the Sutras have fulfilled their goal and have no inherent value for their own sake.<br />In his study, &quot;The Diamond Sutra: Transforming the Way We See the World&quot; Mu Soeng emphasizes the transformative intent of the Diamond Sutra. Mu Soeng is a former Zen monk and currently is the co-director of the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies, Barre, Massachusetts.  His book is a valuable guide to this difficult text designed, Soeng tells us (at xi), for &quot;serious readers of Buddhist teachings.&quot;<br />The book is in three parts.  Part I consists of a historical and thematic discussion of the Diamond Sutra to prepare the reader for a study of the text.  Soeng sets the Sutra in the context of early Buddhism with its belief in the transformative power of shamanism.  He explains well, in a short space, many important concepts of Mahayana Buddhism and how it differed from what its followers perceived as the monastic, scholastic Buddhism codified in the Abidahamma texts of Southern Buddhism.  Soeng also discusses the concepts emptiness, skillful means, and compassion, as exemplified by the Mahayana ideal figure of the Bodhisattva.  The Bodhisattva takes a vow to help all beings become free from suffering before he or she passes into Nirvana.<br />Mu Soeng gives an analysis informed by many sources, both ancient and modern.  He discusses in particular scientific developments in quantum theory and the literary philosophy of deconstruction as analogies to the teachings of the Diamond Sutra.  I am skeptical of the value of these analogies and think they should be used with caution.  I think these teachings, while having some relevance to the Sutra, are basically of the sort that the Buddha counseled his followers to avoid and to transform their minds instead by working towards a different, non-ideological approach to reality and to the end of the concept of self.<br />The second part of the book consists of a paragraph-by-paragraph presentation of the text of the Diamond Sutra together with a commentary.  The commentary is basically Mu Soeng's own, informed by classical and modern texts.  The third part of the book is the simple text of the Diamond Sutra, unadorned by commentary.  Apparently, Mu Soeng suggests his readers approach the Sutra in a manner that follows his presentation (discussion of backround, text and commentary, simple text).<br />I found Mu Soeng's book helpful in approaching this text.  The interested reader may wish to compare the approach of this book to the approach of Red Pine in his recent translation and commentary on the Diamond Sutra.  Both Pine and Soeng emphasize the transformative power of the text.  Pine has less detail on the backround of Buddhism and of the Mahayana School but he offers a wealth of classical Buddhist commentaries on the Diamond Sutra and integrates them well into his own thinking.  His commentary draws much more on traditional Buddhist sources than does Soeng's.<br />Interestingly as well, Pine's pedagogical approach is almost the reverse of Mu Soeng's.  After brief introductory material, Red Pine presents the unadorned text of the Diamond Sutra and then follows it with his detailed section-by-section commentary.  Both Soeng's and Pine's approaches are insightful.<br />Mu Soeng's work will help the reader see the goal of transformation underlying the difficult and great teaching of the Diamond Sutra and to work towards its realization.nsformative power of the text.

Indeed, they were actively discouraged from the traditionally male preserve of combat. Yet a small number of women had the drive to assume male disguise and to enlist and fight. This book helps tell their story.<br /><br />The authors of &#34;They Fought Like Demons&#34; DeAnne Blanton, a military archivist, and Lauren Cook, of Fayetteville State University spent more than a decade in researching primary sources to recreate the role of women as Civil War combatants. Their book tells us something about roughly 250 women soldiers, who fought either for the Union or the Confederacy.<br /><br />The book spends a great deal of space on the motivations that caused women to disguise their sex and enlist. It finds that patriotism and devotion to their respective cause was the chief motive, as it was with men; but also finds that in many cases women enlisted to be with a male loved one, whether husband, lover, father, or brother. This latter motivation seemed important in the accounts and it seems to me different from the motivation of most male combatants.<br /><br />The book gives good detail on women soldiers and, in the process, of Civil War military life. It describes how many women managed to avoid detection (of course, many were unsuccessful in so doing, particularly if they were wounded), the strength with which they fought, how they were regarded by their peers, both when they were assumed to be men and following the discovery that they were women, how women were treated as prisoners of war, in hospitals, and the extent of female casualties in the war. The book discusses the lives of some of the women after their career as soldiers -- one of the most interesting aspects of the book -- and it recounts some of the literature that was published about women soldiers during the Civil War era. There was more of this than I had supposed.<br /><br />At the most basic level, Blanton and Cook make a convincing case that women fought in the war and contributed as soldiers on both sides. Women soldiers fought and sustained casualties at every major Civil War battle. I am a student of the Battle of Gettysburg and learned that a Confederate woman soldier died in Pickett's charge and that there were five women soldiers who were known to have fought at Gettysburg. There were also women prisoners at the notorious facility at Andersonville.<br /><br />The organization of the book makes it difficult to follow the activities of most of the women in detail. This difficulty is also the result of the nature of the historical records. But two or three of the female combatants left memoirs or other records which perhaps could have been highlighted more effectively in this account.<br /><br />It is worth remembering that there were about 2,750,000 combatants in the Civil War, 2 million for the Union, 750,000 for the Confederacy. Blanton and Cook document about 250 women soldiers and accept the general estimate of about 400 women soldiers serving in the War. This is statistically a very small amount. (One percent of 2.75 million is 27,500)It is also, of course, a tiny fractional percentage of the available pool of women. Thus, one should be hesitant about drawing broad global conclusions from this evidence. Blanton and Cook generally use their data wisely and circumspectly.<br /><br />The Civil War remains the pivotal experience in our Nation's history. In many respects, it remains a shared American experience. Thus, it is good to have inclusive histories and to remember the role played by women in combat. Blanton and Cook show that during Civil War times, it was known that there were small numbers of determined women in the ranks.

Cutler, an American psychiatrist, in writing a book &quot;The Art of Happiness&quot; which became a best-seller.  This book taught the importance of &quot;looking within&quot; and of controlling destructive emotions in living a good life and finding happiness.<br />Dr. Cutler and the Dalai Lama have again collaborated in this follow-up book which applies the insights of the initial volume to life situations which are, typically, the sources of great conflict. Several additional books, in addition to this book exploring the world of work, are underway.  The book is based upon a series of conversations held between the Dalai Lama and Dr. Cutler over the course of several years.  Dr. Cutler is responsible for the format and editing of the book.  The final product was read and approved by the Dalai Lama's interpreter.<br />Early in the volume, the Dalai Lama reminds Dr. Cutler that the focus of the inquiry is &quot;secular ethics&quot; (p.7)  One of the most valuable features of the book is that it shows how the Dalai Lama can use his spiritual tradition to articulate values that can be shared by many people, whether or not they are religious believers.  Another feature of the book is the significance of the subject matter.  Many people trust and listen to the Dalai Lama where they will be reluctant to accept possibly similar advice from experts, such as psychiatrists, or from teachers in Western religous traditions.  The book is deceptively simple in tone and teaching, but hard to realize.<br />In a series of discussions Dr. Cutler explores with the Dalai Lama the reasons why many people tend to be bored or dissatisfied with their jobs. Dr. Cutler brings to bear many anecdotes from his work as a psychiatrist as well has his familiarity with much contemporary literature on job satisfaction.  The Dalai Lama brings to bear his wisdom and insight.  Time and again during the conversations, the Dalai Lama takes issue with Dr. Cutler, forcing him to redirect and rephrase his questions and assumptions, and to change the tenor of his approach to questions of happiness in the workplace.  The Dalai Lama's approach is marked by its circumspectness.  He reiterates that the situation of every individual differs and that questions about work admit of no easy solution.  In other words,it is not a case of &quot;one size fits all.&quot;<br />With that said the issues and insights are valuable.  Chief among these for me are the Dalai Lama's comments on self-understanding.  Much difficulty at work is caused by having an overly inflated or an overly deflated view of ourselves and our abilities.  This causes discontent because it gives a picture of our abilities and our expectations of ourselves that are out of touch with reality.<br />Similarly, the Dalai's teachings in this book about patience, humility, self-control, and compassion for one's co-workers provide a great deal to think about in approaching the workplace.  The Dalai Lama, in common with others who have thought about these matters, distinguishes between views of work as a &quot;job&quot;, simply to support oneself, a &quot;career&quot;, with the goal of advancement and growth, and a &quot;calling&quot; in which a person does what he or she finds important to be of service to others.  People necessarily occupy different spaces on this continuum.  For some people, the goal properly should be to learn the value of one's work and to move towards viewing it as a calling.<br />The book also teaches that work and money-making are not the sole source of happiness and urges the reader to develop other interests, particularly a sense of connectedness to others through family or through interests and activities outside the workplace.<br />Many of the criticisms of this book and its predecessor that I have seen turn on the respective roles of the Dalai Lama and Dr. Cutler.  Dr. Cutler serves, I think, as a foil to the Dalai Lama.  In the book, the voices of the two principal are distinct, allowing the reader to capture a good deal of the spirit of the Dalai Lama.<br />There is also a tendency to criticize the book for its simplicity.  I agree the teachings of the book are simple, but in practice they are difficult of realization.  A virtue of the book is its very accessiblity which makes it possible for the reader to try to use it for benefit in his or her own case.<br />Finally, it should be pointed out again that this book does not purport to be an introduction to Buddhism.  It is a work of secular (or applied) ethics.  There are ample books available, including many works of the Dalai Lama, for those who would like a specifically Buddhist study.  One can learn from this book regardless of commitment or lack of commitment to any religion.<br />I thought this book helped me with questions that have bothered me for years.  I also found that the book would probably be useful to many of my coworkers and, perhaps, useful as well, to management where I work.<br />This book will not solve any person's workplace issues, but it will encourage the reader to reconsider and to sharpen his or her focus to address these issues.oices of the two principal are distinct, allowing the reader to capture a good deal of the spirit of the Dalai Lama.<br />There is also a tendency to criticize the book for its simplicity.

Earl J. Hess has written a detailed, scholarly account of Pickett's charge which draws copiously upon contemporary sources. His book is clear and easy to follow, given the subject matter, and is poignant to read. I found myself riveted to his account.<br /><br />I found a major virtue of the book was the manner in which Hess shifted his focus back and forth from the Confederate to the Union side of the line. The book begins with a discussion of the planning of the charge, focusing on the interactions between Lee and Longstreet. This is followed by two chapters dealing with, respectively, the disposition of the Confederate troops before the attack and the Union lines before the attack. I found this invaluable in helping me understand the events of the day and their sequence.<br /><br />Hess follows this discussion with a discussion of the Confederate cannonading barrage, and the Union response, that proceeded the infantry advance. Again, he shifts his focus from the Confederate side of the line, and the effect of the cannonading on the Union, to the Union response and its effect on the Confederacy. He spends a great deal of time explaining the decision of the Union artillerists to hold their fire and the disagreement this decision provoked with General Hancock. This theme pervades the book and is well-treated. Hess concludes that the cannonading was about one hour in duration before the infantry charge,(i.e. from about 1:00p.m. to 2:00p.m.) contrary to some other accounts which make it substantially longer.<br /><br />There are detailed discussions of the Confederate infantry advance to the Emmitsburg Road, to the Stone Fence, and, for a small number of intrepid southern soldiers, over the wall and into the Union lines. We learn about the Union artillery and infantry responses and about their effect on the charge at each stage.<br /><br />There is an excellent but somewhat brief chapter on the repulse of the charge and on the subsequent Confederate retreat back to Virginia. There is an excellent chapter discussing the careers of the principle protagonists of the battle following the events of July 3 through the end of the War and beyond.<br /><br />The book lays a great deal of emphasis on the topography of the battlefield, the hills, ridges, swales, and fences which played a major role in the fighting of July 3. But the key emphasis on the book is on the fighting men on both sides -- on their determination and their heroism. Hess argues that the activities of the troops and their immediate commanders were more important to the results of the day than the decisions of the generals.<br /><br />Hess has many thoughtful things to say about the attack, its planning, and about its possibilities for success. He finds the attack a long chance indeed but is able to present a convincing case about why Lee believed he needed to try. Hess is highly critical of James Longstreet for the manner in which he deployed the attacking divisions and for his failure to provide support to the attack. But he does not believe the attack would have succeeded even if Longstreet had carried out his responsibilities more aggressively. I learned a great deal from Hess's study.<br /><br />This book will help the reader understand the events of July 3. It shows why Pickett's charge, with its suffering, its folly, and its glory retains its hold on the imagination of many Americans.<br /><br />Robin Friedmane at each stage.<br /><br />There is an excellent but somewhat brief chapter on the repulse of the charge and on the subsequent Confederate retreat back to Virginia.

The book consists of photographs of the strippers, the managers, callers, and barkers who run the shows, and their customers, or \\"marks\\".<br />The book first appeared in 1976 and his long been out-of-print. The photographer, Susan Meiselas, was at the time a young woman just out of graduate school. She spent the summers of 1972 -- 1975 following the carnivals and in getting to know the women to photograph them and their environs. She at first offered her photographs and interviews to various feminist publications who turned them down.<br />Meiselas subsequently went on to a distinguished career as a documentary photographer working extensively in Central America and Kurdistan.  In 1992, Meiselas was named a MacArthur fellow.<br />\\"Carnival Strippers\\" received attention upon its initial publication for its frank, but nonjudgmental portrayal of its tawdry subject. The book was made into two plays before it, like the carnival strip shows themselves disappeared from attention. Then, in 2000, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City featured a retrospective of the photographs.  The Whitney Museum published this second edition of \\"Carnival Strippers\\" in 2003 with Sylvia Wolf, curator of photography at the Museum contributing an essay. Deidre English of the Graduate School of Photojournalism at the University of California at Berkeley has also written an essay for the book.<br />In the 2003 edition, 16 new photographs are added from Meiselas's source materials and 13 photographs that appeared in the 1976 edition are deleted, making a total of 76 photographs in the book.  The new edition is also rearranged from the initial text.  There are two sections of photographs, the first called \\"the girl show\\" and the second called \\"portraits\\".  The essays by Wolf and English draw parallels between Meiselas's work and the work of Brassi's 1930 photos of Paris prostitutes, as well as with the work of contemporary photographers such as Diane Arbus.  To me the strongest parallel is Belloq's collection of photographs of prostitutes in Storyville, New Orleans dating from the turn of the century.<br />In the grainy black-and-white photographs of the life of the carnival strip shows, we meet the women and the barkers on the front stage called a \\"bally\\" enticing the men to enter the show.  For a price of $2 or $3, the show consisted of four or five women each dancing naked to, generally, a single 45 rpm record. The book shows photos of the girls at work to crowds of leering men. The world of the \\"girl shows\\" was competitive and nasty.... We see the girls off-stage in dressing rooms and in private moments reflecting on their lives.  There are extensive interviews with the strippers, the managers and barkers and the patrons.  The book also comes with a CD featuring the sounds of the strip shows, interviews with the girls, and a 1997 interview with Susan Meiselas.<br />The book paints the picture of a low, tawdry life with mutual exploitation between the girls, their managers, and the patrons. Yet it is a way of life not without its fascination. It is a life of poor, mostly ignorant, and exploited women, but also a life based upon the rejection of convention and upon attempts to attain independence. Meiselas clearly became taken with the strippers, their attempt at independence, their eccentricities, their vulnerability, and their vulgarity.  For Meiselas and her subjects, Carnival life is something that gets in the person, making it hard to leave when one has been exposed.  I found the life of these now gone carnivals and girl shows got inside me as well in reading this book.<br />The women in this book are not beautiful, air-brushed models and the book has little to offer in the way of titillation.  Meiselas tries to show the viewer and the reader the carnival life for what it was.The book shows a dark corner of the eternal theme of sexuality and love between men and women in all its difficulty and ambiguity....The book shows a dark corner of the eternal theme of sexuality and love between men and women in all its difficulty and ambiguity....	2003-10-28

These essays have appeared in print elsewhere, and most of them are reviews of other Civil War -related literature, including recent scholarly studies, the novel, &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot;, and the movie &quot;Glory&quot;, which focused upon the attack by Federal African-American troops upon Fort Wagner, South Carolina, in July, 1863.  These essays are the product of a masterful historian who has been able to distill a great deal of factual information, reflect upon it, and present his analysis of the significance of the Civil War in an eloquent and persuasive way.<br />The book consists of fifteen essays arranged in five sections.  The first section &quot;Origins of the Civil War&quot; consists of three essays focusing on the pre-Bellum South and on how its culture and commitment to its peculiar institution of slavery brought on the War.<br />The second section of the book, &quot;The War and American Society&quot; consists of four essays that discuss broadly the significance of the Civil War for future generations of Americans, the transformation of the War from a limited conflict to a &quot;total war&quot; that changed the fabric of American society, and on the effect of the War on the status of African-Americans, including the discussion of the movie &quot;Glory&quot; mentioned earlier.<br />The third section of the book, &quot;Why the North Won&quot; will be of interest to students of the military aspects of the War. (Professor McPherson does not denigrate this kind of study, as do some academic historians.)  There are four essays, the first two analyze why the North won the War and why the South lost. The third essay in this section rehabilitates Robert E. Lee from some recent criticism of his leadership; while the final essay focuses on Ulysses Grant's &quot;Personal Memoirs&quot; written near the end of his life, which is a literary masterpiece as well as a book revealing Grant's character and generalship.<br />The fourth section of the book &quot;The Enduring Lincoln&quot; consists of three essays reexamining Lincoln's role in setting and persevering in the aims of the War, in freeing the slaves, and in keeping the hopes of a democratic society alive in a world which was hostile to government &quot;by and for the people.&quot;<br />The final section of the book consists of a single essay titled &quot;What's the Matter with History?&quot; This essay discusses the three types of reader interested in reading about the Civil War&quot; the professional historian, the amateur student of battles, sometimes called a Civil War &quot;buff&quot;, and the mythical &quot;general reader&quot;.  McPherson laments the inability of professional historians to write books appealing to an audience of anyone other than their peers.  It is a shortcoming that Professor McPherson's own writings manage brilliantly to avoid.<br />This is not a book of facts and figures, dates and statistics.  It is a book of historical reflection that will help the reader think about the meaning and importance of our country's Civil War.revealing Grant's character and generalship.<br />The fourth section of the book &quot;The Enduring Lincoln&quot; consists of three essays reexamining Lincoln's role in setting and persevering in the aims of the War, in freeing the slaves, and in keeping the hopes of a democratic society alive in a world which was hostile to government &quot;by and for the people.&quot; <br />The final section of the book consists of a single essay titled &quot;What's the Matter with History?&quot; This essay discusses the three types of reader interested in reading about the Civil War&quot; the professional historian, the amateur student of battles, sometimes called a Civil War &quot;buff&quot;, and the mythical &quot;general reader&quot;.

US	48185764	R2A80X8G5EX6S2	0393324583	890178124	The Book of Splendor: A Novel	Books	3	8	13	N	N	A Book not Splendid	The Zohar, or \\"Book of Splendor\\" is the central work of Jewish mysticism. In common with most forms of mysticism, Jewish mysticism encourages an experiential, contemplative approach to the divine.  In Judaism, the Zohar and contemplative practices often served as a counterweight to the rationalistic approach of philosophers such as Maimonides.  Rabbi Jacob Lowe of early 17th century Prague was a leading scholar and practicioner of Jewish mysticism. He figures prominently in Frances Sherwood's novel, \\"The Book of Splendor\\".  As recounted in this book, Rabbi Lowe had difficulty, with all his efforts, in capturing something of a transcendental experience.  He does so near the close of this novel.<br />For all its origins in the deep world of mysticism and contemplation, this novel falls far short. Sherwood describes her book as a \\"historical fantasy.\\"  The book is neither a historical novel because of the fanciful elements it includes nor a work of unfettered imagination because of the attempt to root it in a historical period and in historical event. The two elements, the history and the fantasy, are ineffectively combined, and the story, for me, collapses under its own weight.<br />Furthermore the book is more than a historical novel and a fantasy.  It includes strong elements of polemic. The polemic is the weakest part of the book and contributes strongly to the dissatisfaction I felt with it.<br />The book is set in Prague in 1600.  A major theme of the book is Jewish-Christian relations.  The Jews were begrudgingly allowed to live in Prague.  In this book, they live precariously in a ghetto and are live in constant danger from the government as well as from peasants and hostile townspeople and clergy that the government cannot effectively control.<br />The book also has as a major character the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph II who ruled Prague at the time. The book portrays his combination of madness and evil. Rudolph wishes to become immortal and enlists the help of alchemists from England as well as Rabbi Lowe.  The book includes as side-characters Tycho Brahe and Jonathan Kepler who become leading figures in the incipient scientific enlightenment.<br />The book has as its chief female character a young woman named Rochel of uncertain origins.  She marries a cobbler named Zev who is substanially older. Rochel respects but does not, for most of the book love Zev.<br />These disparate plots are tied together by the legend and figure of the golem.  The golem is a legendary creature that was said to have been created by Rabbi Loew to save the Jewish community from harm in Prague.  The golem does that in this book.  He also does much else, including becoming the lover of Rochel and allowing her, the story goes, to come to some form of peace with herself.<br />The story is cluttered, slow moving and does not hold together.  I found the various components of the story working at cross-purposes to each other making the book confusing and unfocused. The most unconvincing portions of the book, and the portions which receive the most attention in the novel, are those involving the young woman Rochel and her relationship with the golem.  I want to discuss this briefly.<br />The character of Rochel I found entirely anacronistic in a historical novel of this period or in a historical fantasy. I mentioned that this book has strong elements of polemic, and Rochel is a polemical figure. Rochel is a poor, illiterate woman who has been raised by her grandmother. When she makes her marriage with Zev, we find that she is impatient with her lot. Through her voice, Sherwood makes many criticisms of the status of women and of the alleged patriarchial character of the Judaism of the day of the story. I find these criticism out of place for a novel of this time period.  Rochel bemoans her illiteracy and dreams of becoming a scholar.  She objects the the practice of the traditional Judaism of her day that required women to cut their hair and wear wigs.She objects to the Jewish rituals of purification for women.  She finds her husband's lovemaking efforts clumsy and unrewarding.  She longs for passion in her life.  In a book that focuses heavily on the precarious character of Jewish ghetto life and that also tries to portray the Jewish experience positively and warmly, I found this proto-20th century feminism distracting and out of place.  Rochel does not come alive in the book, and I had no sympathy for her many adventures and distresses in the course of the novel.<br />After Rabbi Loew creates the golem, a relationship develops between Rochel and the creature.  They have an affair, after which Rochel is condemned as an adulteress both by most of the Jewish community and by the Christian community outside the ghetto. Given the time and place of the story, and the strong biblical prohibitions against adultery, the book fails to convince me that the public reaction, Jewish and Christian, was entirely wrong or out of place for the time.<br />The affair between Rochel and the golem, a creature of legend, is implausible and unconvincing.  Further, I felt uncomfortable with what, to me, the author was conveying in her story of a passion between a beautiful but frustrated young woman and a robot, for want of a better word. I found that by making the golem an outlet for Rochel's passion, the book deprecates the relationship between women and men.  More specifically, the story -- and the liasion the author creates between Rochel and the golem -- deprecates men. It makes an assumption, common to other literature of this type that I have read, that men are themselves incapable of a loving responsible relationship with a woman.  This is why, I think, Rochel comes to herself in this book after the affair with the golem, rather than with, say, a relationship with a human being -- a man, whether a Jewish man within the ghetto or a non-Jewish man outside it.  Too much of this book is simply a chapter in the modern version of the war between the sexes set in Prague in 1600.  As I indicated, the sexual polemic does not fit well with the historical setting of the book or with the sympathy the author tries to convey for Jewish life in the ghetto in these times.<br />In summary, the novel moves very slowly and I grew impatient with it. I didn't find the book enjoyable or elevating to read.  The various components of the story don't hang together well.  The story of the golem is a rather overworked legend at best and it doesn't work well in the context of this novel. The book is spoiled by its use of too many overtly feminist themes during a time and a place in which these themes did not and could not have played a large role.<br />I enjoyed reading the various comments of the other Amazon reviewers of this book.

US	48185764	RGEBFOLOS0AP7	0306812614	513451103	Last Chance For Victory: Robert E. Lee And The Gettysburg Campaign	Books	4	10	13	N	N	A Thoughtful Consideration of the Battle of Gettysburg	It is instructive to read Bowden and Ward's study, &#34;Last Chance for Victory,&#34; because the book takes issue with much recent scholarship about the Battle of Gettysburg and of the factors which led to Southern defeat. Many students attribute the result of the battle to Southern overconfidence and to mistakes in judgment by the Confederate high command, particularly Robert E.Lee.<br /><br />Bowden and Ward draw a basic distinction in their study between command decisions on the one hand and the execution of these decisions on the other hand. They conclude that Lee was actively involved in the Battle of Gettysburg, on both the first and the second day, and that the failures on these days were failures of execution by Lee's subordinates. Examples include Jeb Stuart's disobedience to Lee's orders early in the campaign, Richard Ewell's failure to take Cemetery Hill or Culp's Hill, and A.P. Hill's failure to timely advance his divisions to attack the Union center on July 2 as part of Lee's en echelon plan of attack.<br /><br />Bowden and Ward exonerate James Longstreet, in agreement with most recent studies of Gettysburg, of dilatoriness on the second day of the battle. But they are highly critical of Longstreet's performance on July 3 and come too close to accusing Longstreet of responsiblity for the failure of Pickett's charge. Bowden and Ward also criticize Lee for delegating too much responsiblity to Longstreet on day 3, particularly when he knew that Longstreet opposed the frontal assault, and for failing to assume direct control of the charge himself.<br /><br />The aim of the study is polemical, in good part. The book is longer than it needs to be and many sections are too argumentative. Some of the argument I found unconvincing, which is not necessarily a bad thing in a book on a subject as controversial and difficult as the Battle of Gettysburg.<br /><br />The book has some outstanding virtues. The writing is clear (although the book is marred by many typos). When Bowden and Ward get down to explaining the specifics of the battle, the writing is informative, consise, and not overly bogged-down in detail. After reading the account of the fighting on July 1 and July 2, I thought I understood the confusing action of these days better than I had before. The maps in the book are helpful. The authors do a good job relating Lee's military strategy at Gettysburg to military theory, particularly as developed in the Napoleonic campaigns.<br /><br />&#34;Last Chance for Victory&#34; is not the only book a student of the Battle of Gettysburg should read because Bowden and Ward write from a standpoint presupposing some familiarity in the reader with recent accounts of the Battle. One of the cardinal virtues of the book is that it serves to remind the reader that there are many sides to a story. In any kind of serious study, it is good to learn to withhold judgment until one has considered a variety of points of view. This is a lesson in studying Gettysburg or in any serious study and the book teaches it well.<br /><br />I learned a great deal from this book but came away not entirely convinced. The main difficulty I have with Bowden and Ward's argument is that they try to separate too sharply the orders that Lee gave and his battle plan from the execution of these plans by his subordinates. The plan and the execution were closely related at many critical points of the battle. The shortcomings in execution by Lee's subordinates cannot be sharply distinguished from Lee's orders. In spite of what Bowden and Ward argue, many of these orders were ambiguous and were so viewed by those to whom they were directed. Further Lee had the opportunity to rectify many of the dilatory actions of his subordinates (or many of their actions which perhaps did not accord with his orders) but did not do so. For example, Lee could have been much more explicit with Ewell about capturing Cemetry Hill to remove any grounds for doubt and could have followed-up agressively with him. Lee had the opportunity to tell A.P. Hill to correct his formations on July 2 and to have his (Hill's) subordinate commanders move more decisively following the actions of Longstreet's Corps. He did not do so. There was a great deal of difficulty to go around in the Confederate battle plan and in its execution in these three momentous days. In addition, as Bowden and Ward realize, there was the Union Army. When these factors are considered, Bowden and Hill can be read as modifying but not radically changing scholarly consideration of the Battle of Gettysburg.<br /><br />Bowden and Ward try to foist responsiblity for the failure of &#34;Pickett's Charge&#34; on July 3 on Longstreet. There is nothing in their brief treatment of day 3 of the battle that convinces me that Pickett's charge had much chance of success or that Longsteet was to blame for the conception of the attack or for its execution. I don't understand that Bowden and Ward contend that the attack would likely have succeeded if it had been executed as they claim Lee had planned. I think the treatment of the third day of the battle is the weakest portion of this book.<br /><br />This book will help the student rethink the Battle of Gettysburg and to learn the value of deliberation before one draws overly firm and dogmatic conclusions about a difficult matter.<br /><br />Robin Friedman-up agressively with him.

This illustrated the banalization of the Beethoven mythos...\\"<br />Buch's study of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony has little to do with Beethoven's music.  Rather it is a study giving some backround on the creation of the work and a study of the way it has been received, interpreted, and politicized by some over the years following Beethoven's death in 1827.  There are two interrelated themes in the book: 1. The Ninth Symphony has been used by groups as diverse as socialists, communists, American democrats, pan-Europeanists, fascists, nazis, racists, and many others to support their ideologies and 2. With the passage of time and the dramatic changes that societies have underwent since the composition of the Ninth, Beethoven's music, and its sense of heroism and universality, become ever more difficult for the modern listener to understand and appreciate.<br />Neither of these claims are particularly new or surprising.  Of the two, Buch devotes most of his attention to the first, although I find the second rather broader and more interesting.<br />The first part of this book discusses the development of what Buch terms \\"modern political music\\".  He discusses the reception of Handel in England, the use of \\"La Marsellaise\\" as an anthem for the French Revolution, Haydn's composition of an anthem for the German Emperor,Franz Joseph II, \\"God Save the Emperor\\" and other sources as predecessors to Beethoven.  Most interestingly, Buch discusses well Beethoven's own efforts as a composer of overtly \\"political\\" music to celebrate the reactionary Congress of Vienna of 1814.  Chief among these works is Beethoven's cantata \\"The Glorious Moment\\", opus 136.  The discussion of Beethoven's own overtly political compositions is probably the most insightful and interesting part of this uneven book.<br />Buch offers a rather incomplete discussion of the Schiller's composition of \\"Ode to Joy\\", but his book includes little in the way of musical analysis of Beethoven's setting and still less of a discussion of the Ninth Symphony as a whole.  This limits the book's value and its interest, I am afraid.<br />There are discussions about how groups tended to read their own meaning into Beethoven's music and Schiller's poem. In other words, there was a tendency to take Beethoven's majestic music and use it to call attention to the political causes of the day rather than to the music itself. This should surprise no one.<br />Buch develops his theme through a discussion of the 1845 ceremony in Bonn in which a statue was erected to Beethoven's memory (strangely, the book does not include a photo of this still-standing statue), followed by a discussion of the rise of nationalism, communism, democracy, Nazism and other causes, some good, some bad, some horrible. He points out, interestingly, that from the mid-19th Century there was an attempt to claim that when Schiller wrote his \\"Ode to Joy\\" (Freude) he meant \\"Freedom\\" (Freiheit). There is no historical evidence to support this claim but it has been used by many. Buch suggests that Beethoven's music has become platitudinous through exposure and through the uses to which it has been put.<br />There are some interesting points to be made here.  In the Ninth Symphony, Beethoven did seem to be addressing humanity.  He wanted to write a \\"public\\" work rather than a work of a deeply introspective character such as, say, the last string quartets or the opus 109 piano sonata.  It is not necessarily a bad thing that people have used this work to reflect their own ideals, and Beethoven cannot be blamed for some of the dreadful causes that have looked to him as an alleged forbearer.  That people have done so does not exhaust his musicor its meaning.  Buch's study could have used more musical analysis and could have considered other ways of thinking about the Ninth Symphony in addition to its uses in the service of various, contradictory forms of political propaganda.  I am not sure if Buch really touches the Ninth Symphony as a work of art and as an ideal.  He seems to want to deconstruct the Ninth as both, and he does not succeed.<br />I thought the writing in this book was verbose, jargon-ridden, and hard to follow.  I am not sure whether this was due to the text, the translation, or to both, as I suspect. Sentences are long and stringy and run-on too much for English.  There are some sections of interesting discussion, but they are combined with too much irrelevance and too much of a tendency to polemicize.<br />I came away thinking that this book did show me something of Beethoven as a political composer that was worth knowing (chiefly his composition of the \\"Glorious Moment\\" cantata,), but it did not appreciably increase my understanding of the Ninth Symphony.  Also, I found the book of limited value for its understanding of the vagaries of modern politics.  Thus on the whole I found this book disappointing.sic or its meaning.

First, The Civil War transformed a Union of States into a single Nation. This change is exemplified in Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. As Professor McPherson points out in the preface to his essays, in the Gettysburg Address Lincoln spoke of the American &quot;nation&quot; rather than of a &quot;union&quot;  in order &quot;to invoke a new birth of American Freedom and nationhood.&quot; (p. vii)<br />Second, the change of America from a union of states to a nation was accompanied by a change in the concept of liberty on which the nation was founded.  In a word, this change involved emancipation, the abolition of slavery, and the application to all people of the principle articulated in the Declaration of Independence that &quot;all men are created equal&quot;. In several essays, Professor McPherson uses the work of the political philosopher Isaiah Berlin to develop a distinction between negative and positive liberty.  Before the Civil War, liberty was understood primarily in a negative way whcih involved individual freedom from government regulation and freedome from interference with private property.  With the Civil War, the concept of liberty changed to allow the Federal government to assume a positive role in promoting human freedom and human good.  The most striking example, of course, is the abolition of slavery.  But the concept of the government's role in creating a positive concept of liberty has continued.<br />Professor McPherson's essays show how Lincoln unified the ideals of Nationhood and Liberty as the Civil War progressed and thus effected a revolution in the basic nature of the United States. The essays explore these basic themes masterfully as Professor McPherson discusses Lincoln's political skills, his insistence on the unconditional surrender of the South, the development of Lincoln's ideas on emancipation, the significance to the second American Revolution of Lincoln's eloquence as a speaker and a writer, and much else.<br />Professor McPherson also discusses the Reconstruction period in a thoughtful way.  He takes issue, in part with modern revisionsists who claim that the Civil War failed in its basic aims by the backtracking from Reconstruction and the reinstitution of Jim Crow that occurred following 1876. A &quot;second reconstruction&quot; proved necessary in the mid-20th Century to realize fully the aims of the first. But this does not derogate, Professor McPherson argues, the significance of the Revolution that was wrought by Lincoln and the Civil War.<br />This book will help the reader to think about Abraham Lincoln and to understand why the Civil War remains the pivotal event in our Nation's history.f liberty has continued.<br />Professor McPherson's essays show how Lincoln unified the ideals of Nationhood and Liberty as the Civil War progressed and thus effected a revolution in the basic nature of the United States.

The Heart Sutra dates from about 350 A.D., by best estimates, and is part of the broad school of Buddhism known as the Mahayana, as distinguished from the earlier tradition known as the Theravada. The Heart Sutra is a distillation of a series of Mahayana texts known as the &quot;Perfection of Wisdom&quot; sutras some of which consist of as much as 100,000 stanzas. (The Diamond Sutra is the other well known Perfection of Wisdom sutra) The Heart Sutra thus is difficult in its brevity almost as much as in the profundity of its teachings.<br />Professor Donald Lopez is a well-known academic Buddhist scholar whose most recent books tend to take a historical, almost naturalistic approach to Buddhism.  His early book, &quot;The Heart Sutra explained&quot; consists of the brief text of the Heart Sutra together with an introduction and a commentary.  The commentary is not modern in character.  Instead, Professor Lopez' commentary is based upon the work of seven classical commentators on the Heart Sutra from medieval India written between about 750 and 1050 A.D.  Professor Lopez also provides in full two Tibetan commentaries on the Heart Sutra dating from the 19th Century.<br />Following the introduction, the first part of the book is a detailed commentary on the text of the Heart Sutra, beginning with the title.  The commentary focuses on the two most famous parts of the Sutra, the difficult statement that &quot;Form is emptiness; emptiness is form&quot;, and the mantra near the conclusion of the Sutra, which is generally translated as &quot;Gone, gone, gone beyond, gone completely beyond, enlightenment.&quot;<br />Lopez discusses the comments of the Indian and Tibetan commentators on each section of this text and also offers his own explanatory backround information.  The book is a difficult reading, of a difficult text and difficult commentaries.  The book did help me with the text and helped me understand Mahayana Buddhism.  The Heart Sutra presupposes in its readers a basic understanding of the earlier form of Buddhism and its teachings.<br />The second part of a book consists of commentaries on the Heart Sutra by two 19th century Tibetan teachers.  Both are lengthy and difficult.  The first commentary is rationalistic in character, I think, while the second commentary is longer and takes a tantric approach to the text.<br />I thought the title of Professor Lopez' book, &quot;The Heart Sutra Explained&quot; was something of an overstatement, in that the Heart Sutra may be a text that resists and denies explanation.  This notwithstanding, I learned from the book and feel better able to approach the Heart Sutra.<br />There are many books available on Buddhism, but relatively few  are based strictly on the Buddhist texts themselves and fewer still offer the reader the opportunity to approach the texts through ancient commentaries.  Professor Lopez' book does both.  Although difficult, I think this textual approach is the best way to understand Buddhism for the serious student.lp me with the text and helped me understand Mahayana Buddhism.

The book deserves the praise it has received.  There is much more to this novel than can be captured in any movie or TV series on the Civil War. The book is a fitting introduction to the Civil War and to the Battle of Gettysburg.  The book illustrates a lesson too easily forgotten --how fiction, well done, has the power to give meaning to fact.<br />The Battle of Gettysburg took place from July 1 -- July 3, 1863.  It remains, probably, the pivotal battle of the Civil War and has been written about endlessly.<br />Michael Scharaa's novel is in four large chapters, one for each day of the battle together with an introductory chapter setting the stage.  The story is told in sections devoted alternately to the perspectives and roles of many of the leading protagonists: the Confederate Generals, Lee, Longstreet, and Armistead, the British writer Freemantle, a guest in the Confederate camp, and the Union Generals Chamberlain and Buford.<br />There are many excellent historical studies of the Battle of Gettysburg (Steven Sears and Noah Trudeau have written two recent ones) and it is worth thinking about how these studies differ from the picture of Gettysburg we see in &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;.<br />The novel gives a vivid picture of each of the three days of the battle, but it is more selective, focused picture than we get in the histories.  The novel concentrates on the events on Little Round Top -- the far left of the Union line on the second day of the battle, July 2.  The hero is Colonel Joshua Chamberlain and his men from the twentieth Maine who hold of a furious Confederate charge over the boulders of Little Round Top and help save the Union position.<br />The novel also concentrates on Pickett's doomed charge on the third day of the Battle.  We see a great deal about General Armistead (in Pickett's Division) who dies after reaching the Union lines and remained a devoted friend of Union General Hancock over the wall.<br />The novel form (fiction) allows the writer to concentrate on specific scenes, as Sharaa does well in &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;, to a degree the historian cannot.  The novel also allows the writer to explore the relationships among and the thoughts of the protagonists to a degree that goes beyond the historical record.  Sharra exploits this possiblity to the utmost.  He gives the reader interchanges between Lee and Longstreet, for example, that are entirely plausible, that make them come alive, and that cast great light upon their activities and motivations during the Battle.  We see a great deal of Colonel Chamberlain, of course. The reader hears Sharra recreating Chamberlain's innermost thoughts and is encouraged to think about the making of a hero.<br />The novelistic form also allows Sharaa to use characters to express their views of the meaning of the War.  The reader is given an unforgettable picture of what both sides thought they were fighting for and is invited to think about the War and the Battle for him or herself.<br />This novel will not replace historical studies for those interested in learning more about the Civil War or about the details of the Battle of Gettysburg.  But it is a thoroughly admirable novel which captures something of the harshness and the heroism of the War and of the American character.  It will give the careful reader a good understanding, or a good way to work through to an understanding, of the events of these three days in 1863.  &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; will encourage the reader to think about, and to deepen his or her appreciation of, our country's history.wall.<br />The novel form (fiction) allows the writer to concentrate on specific scenes, as Sharaa does well in &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;, to a degree the historian cannot.

Professor McPherson has read and analyzed a prodigious amount of source material written by Civil War combatants, Union and Confederacy, officer and enlisted soldier.  For this book, he has taken a sample of the letters home and the diaries of 1076 soldiers, 647 Union and 429 Confederate to analyze their candid, uncensored reflections of why they fought.  Professor McPherson also draws on many modern studies of combat psychology and utilzes their findings in discussing the Civil War soldiers.<br />Professor McPherson's sample is not statistically random and it may be skewed in some ways.  For example, the sample does not include (obviously) illiterate soldiers or black soldiers.  It tends to be tilted in the direction of those individuals who did most of the fighting and who were committed to their respective causes.  Professor McPherson recognizes that many of the combatants were unwilling participants, particularly as the draft was instituted in both armies and that both armies included many shirkers.  These individuals are not represented in his sample of letters. But still, these letters, written in the activity of soldiering and not intended for publication, are revealing of their authors' thoughts and feelings in a way impossible to replicate in other writings.<br />The letters reveal much about the motivation of the combatants and about life in Civil War America.  Professor McPherson finds that many of the soldiers in the Civil War had a firm idea of why they were fighting.  On both sides soldiers fought for the preservation of liberty and the duty they perceived they owed to their country.  Patriotism, in a word.  Southern soldiers fought to achieve their independence and to avoid what they viewed as &quot;subjugation&quot; and &quot;slavery&quot;.  Northern soldiers fought to preserve the Union and, increasingly as the War progressed, to end slavery.  Soldiers in both the Union and the Confederacy drew sustenance from religious convictions.  They were motivated deeply by the camaraderie that developed with their fellows, particularly in their own units.  In the Civil War in particular, soldiers fought side-by-side with others from their own state and community.  They developed a strong bond with each other, based on the terrors of war and the privations of the camps, and fought in solidarity with each other.<br />The letters in the book speak well for themselves with Professor McPherson's organization and commentary.  It is moving to read about how many Americans were driven by high ideals in enlisting and fighting in this, the most deadly and formative of the wars of the United States.<br />There is a sense of poignancy throughout the book. For the Civil War generation, concepts of duty, honor, family, manhood, and patriotism were not viewed with the skepticism that became common following WW I and that remains prevalent with many people today. It was a romantic generation, in part, but one with commitments and ideals.  I think there is much contemporary Americans may learn by the devotion shown by the American Civil War soldiers and by the ideals of liberty, duty, and courage for which they fought.ught to preserve the Union and, increasingly as the War progressed, to end slavery.

The first category consists of biographies of the &quot;subjective&quot; Lincoln.  These biographies are based largely on the many anecdotes and stories people told about Lincoln's life, typically during the early years in Illinois and concentrate on trying to explore Lincoln as a man (He remains an enigma.)The second category of Lincoln biography is the political.  This biography focuses on Lincoln's public actions, typically during or shortly before his Presidency and draws on the lengthy public record available during the Civil War years.  This type of biographical approach tends to give short shrift to the personal approach.<br />In his &quot;Abraham Lincoln, Redeemer President&quot; Allen Guelzo points out these two approaches to Lincoln studies (p.472) and says that his book is an attempt to combine the personal and public approaches to Lincoln.  Professor Guelzo, Dean of Templeton Honors Colledge and Professor of History at Eastern Universtiy, writes a primarily intellectual biography; but he tries to explore the degree to which Lincoln's thought formed his political actions.<br />Professor Guelzo devotes a great deal of attention to establishing Lincoln's political identity as a whig -- an admirer of both Henry Clay and Daniel Webster.  From his early days in public life, Lincoln was interested in promoting economic opportunity by encouraging the free market.  He supported ambitious programs of public works and public education, to develop transportation infrastructure, (canals, roads, and railroads) and to promote the growth of industry and of a middle class.  The whig approach emphasized public virtue, public morality, the value of hard work, and a unified United States.  Guelzo effectively contrasts Lincoln's Whiggish beliefs with the agrarian beliefs of the Jefferson-Jacksonian democrats with their commitment to a nation of agrarian, self-sufficient yeomen and farmers.  (Lincoln's father was such a yeoman, and Lincoln wanted none of it for himself.)<br />Professor Guelzo traces the beginnings of Lincoln's opposition to the expansion of slavery, in the early 1850's. to his desire to promote the development of upwardly mobile capitalist workers.  He tended to see agrarianism as slavery slightly disguised.  Lincoln never lost his whig commitments, according to Professor Guelzo, even after the party disbanded and Lincoln became a leader of the Republican party.<br />Professor Guelzo also studies the nature of Lincoln's religious beliefs and the importance Lincoln gave to religous questions. As is the case with Lincoln's economic rebellion against his father, Professor Guelzo finds the beginnings of Lincoln's religious thought in a youthful rebellion against the Calvinism and predestinarian beliefs of his father.  Lincoln found he could not believe in the revealed God of the Bible, although he knew the Bible well.  He could not accept the doctrine of predestination, but he came close to it in a secular way.  During most of his life, Lincoln was a determinist who believed that people had little independent choice in what they did but acted in response to outside factors which they did not control.<br />According to Professor Guelzo, Lincoln also tended towards the englightenment of John Locke and towards the utilitarianism of Mill and Bentham.  His politics and Presidency, of course, have distincly pragmatic characters.  Throughout his life, Lincoln remained outside the fold of organized religion.<br />According to Professor Guelzo, Lincoln's thought developed as Lincoln confronted at deepening levels the difficulty of the Civil War.  The beginning of this development was the 1858 Lincoln-Douglas debates where Lincoln vigourously attacked the morality of holding slaves.  Lincoln's thoughts on providence, for Professor Guelzo, were instrumental in Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln told his cabinet he had made apromise &quot;to his maker&quot; to issue the Proclamation and that he could not do otherwise. (pp 341-42.)  Guelzo continues his treatment of providential themes in Lincoln with his discussion of the Gettysburg Address and the Second Inaugural Address.<br />There is also a great deal in the book that discusses Lincoln's handling of the War, the border states, his generals, and the Army.  Professor Guelzo's intellectual and religous themes sometimes get lost in these discussions, and we are reminded that Lincoln was a pragmatist, a leader and a consummate politician.<br />The picture of Lincoln's religiosity that emerges from Professor Guelzo's study has a distinctly modern flavor.  (Professor Guelzo sees it as high Victorian.)  Lincoln was a person who sought religous belief but could not find his way to an organized religion of his day.  He was not, in his mid and late life, content simply with materialism and skepticism but rather developed his own religious thought based upon a rather loosely defined notion of providence and redemption. As personal as his thought was, it helped shape our nation.  Lincoln's life, as Professor Guelzo presents it, seems to be a paradigm of many people today who reject organized religion in favor of a search for what many call spirituality.<br />On a political level, Guelzo's account of Lincoln stresses that the United States is and has become a unified Nation and that Americans should see themselves, for all their diversity and differences as part of a unified people.  I also see the book as a reminder of the value of hard work and economic effort.<br />Professor Guelzo has written a thoughtful, provocative study of Lincoln the man, the thinker, and the President.e a promise &quot;to his maker&quot; to issue the Proclamation and that he could not do otherwise.

In his short, eloquent book, &quot;Hallowed Ground,&quot; it is almost as if Professor McPherson is at the reader's side accompanying the reader as a guide to the great battle that took place from July 1 -- July 3, 1863.<br />McPherson is an ideal guide for many reasons.  Most importantly, he is reflective.  His focus is on the meaning and significance of the Battle rather than on bare fact or on a strict discussion of detailed military maneuvers. McPherson sees the Battle, and the Civil War in general, as a conflict driven by the institution of slavery.  He reminds the reader of the &quot;New Birth of Freedom&quot; that President Lincoln saw as the meaning of the conflict in his Gettysburg Address. McPherson is alive to other meanings of the struggle, including the role it played in forging an American nationalism, and including as well the valor shown and the sacrifices endured by the many who fought at Gettysburg, from the Union and from the Confederacy. The reader comes away from the book encouraged to think through the meaning of the Battle.  This would be the best result that could be achieved from a book about Gettysburg or from a visit to the Battlefield.<br />Professor McPherson is also an ideal guide because he resists the temptation to say too much. Several recent books such as those by Stephen Sears and Noah Trudeau offer outstanding accounts of the fighting at Gettysburg, its prelude, and its aftermath.  Professor McPherson's book, in contrast, is not a detailed military study of the campaign.  Rather, he gives the reader short summaries of the fighting on each of the three days of the battle.  What he says is lucid and cuts to the heart of the battle.  It is what a person seeing the Battlefield would need to know, and what the visitor could reasonably hope to absorb in a single visit without becoming bogged down in a welter of detail. (The detail of course is necessary for those wishing to study the battle in depth.)<br />McPherson is also an ideal guide because of his sense of place at the Battlefield.  McPherson tells the reader that he has seen the Battlefield by walking, biking, car and bus.  He has brought his classes from Princeton, as well as other groups, to see the Battlefield and to think about the role of the Battle of Gettysburg and the Civil War in American History.  McPherson's account emphasizes the physical features of the battlefield --where the trees and orchards were in 1863 and where the land now differs from its topography at the time of the battle.  He is full of anecdotes about people of the Battle, of great rank and of low rank, and of civilians.  He has wonderfully specific information about the many monuments and statutes that await the visitor at Gettysburg and that memorialze the events of the Battle.  He is also full of challenging questions and of answers that may surprise.  For example, &quot;is there any significance to whether a horse is standing on two legs in determining whether its rider survived the battle&quot;? (see p. 40) &quot;Who is the only enlisted soldier with his own monument on the battlefield and why? (see p.53) Also, &quot;Did the Battle of Gettysburg result from an advance Confederate brigade entering Gettysburg in search of shoes&quot;? (see p.35-36)  McPherson's avoids pat answers to these and many other questions.<br />This book is a meditation on the Battle of Gettysburg by a writer who has thought long and deeply about his subject.

He described the music as a &#34;cosmic drama.&#34; The piece is indeed a musical picture of the human search for meaning and religion and a world full of skepticism about both. (Ives himself was a believer of a rather traditional sort.)<br /><br />I thought of Ives, and his &#34;Unanswered Question&#34; in reading Don Cupitt's short study &#34;After God&#34;. Cupitt is a fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge and his written widely on religious subjects. He is the founder of the &#34;Sea of Faith&#34; movement, which is an attempt to provide meaning for religion in a non-theistic, non-traditional sense.<br /><br />The book is modernistic in tone. It is addressed to the many people who attempt to find a form of religion in their lives separate from theism. In setting out his topic Cupitt states: &#34;Religious life is an expressive, world-building activity through which we can get ourselves together and find a kind of posthumous, or retrospective, happiness&#34;. (page xiv)<br /><br />The book is in three parts. In the first part, &#34;The Coming of the Gods&#34;, Cupitt tries to give a historical, genetic account of the origins of theistic belief, based on the development of cities and ruling hierarchies from more primitive hunting or agrarian societies. He finds both religion and early philosophy derivative of this change in human social organization.<br /><br />In the second section, &#34;The Departure of the Gods&#34; Cupitt explores the difficulties in the concept of a transcendent God separate from the imminent world of the everyday. He talks insightfully, if too briefly, of the development of philosophy from the objective realism of Plato (both the chief hero and the chief villain of the book) through Kant's internalization of the sources of human knowledge, through Nietzsche and modern philosophy of language. His position straddles, I think, postmodern thought, which denies the possibility of any absolute truth separate from the observer, and a more traditional philosophical naturalism (denial of supernaturalism) where I think it is ultimately more comfortable.<br /><br />The third part of the book &#34;Religion after the Gods&#34; offers a new version of religion stripped of its theological trappings. Cupitt adopts a three-fold religious practice from the wisdom of the past, consisting of 1. attempting to see one's life through the eye of eternity 2. meditation on emptiness and 3. &#34;solar living&#34; -- a radiant, outgoing way of life based on emotion and human need, receptive to change and to the moment, and concerned with immanences here and now rather than fixed absolutes. Cupitt sees religion as ultimately global in character, breaking down the tendency of believers to separate themselves and their creed from other parts of humanity. Strangely enough, he closes the book with advice that people remain in their current religious traditions, but follow them in a manner consistent with the teachings of his book.<br /><br />Cupitt writes eloquently and well. I am in sympathy with much of his programme, but he moves too quickly at times. There is a sense in his book of the mystery and enigma that Ives presents so well in &#34;the unanswered question&#34;; although, paradoxically, Cupitt seems too eager to dissolve the mystery by creating a dogma of his own.<br /><br />Those wanting to hear more of Cupitt might be interested in looking up his interview with Steven Batchelor in the Fall, 2003,issue of &#34;Tricycle, the Buddhist Review.&#34;<br /><br />Robin Friedmanthe observer, and a more traditional philosophical naturalism (denial of supernaturalism) where I think it is ultimately more comfortable. <br />The third part of the book \\"Religion after the Gods\\" offers a new version of religion stripped of its theological trappings.

It was the largest battle ever fought in the Western Hemisphere and ended the Confederacy's second invasion of the North.  Following the battle, the community of Gettysburg was thick with dead and wounded men.  The Governor of Pennsylvania authorized the purchase of a cemetry for the reburial of the Union dead.  The cemetry was dedicated in a ceremony on November 19, 1863.  Edward Everett, a disinguished orator of the day, delivered a speech lasting over two hours.  President Abraham Lincoln also accepted an invitation to deliver short remarks.  His remarks of 272 became known as the Gettysburg Address.  They constitute a seminal statement, and restatement of the American vision.<br />Gary Wills's study \\"Lincoln at Gettysburg\\" deserves the accolades it has received if for no other reason than it gave many readers the opportunity to read and think about the Gettysburg Address.  This is a speech that is dulled and lost in childhood.  It needs to be approached and rethought as an adult to get an understanding of the depth of Lincoln's message.<br />Wills sees the Gettysburg Address as recasting and remaking the American democratic experience.  The speech expressly brings the hearer and reader back to the Declaration of Independence with its self-evident truth that \\"All men are created equal.\\"  This truth, Lincoln turns into a \\"proposition\\" on which our country was founded. (The Constitution, adopted thirteen years after the Declaration, countenances slavery and includes no language about human equality.)  In his spare prose, Lincoln says little directly about the nature of \\"equality\\".  Wills discusses the address and masterfully places it in the context of Lincoln's earlier speeches to help the reader understand the development of Lincoln's ideas on slavery, the antithesis of human equality.<br />The Gettysburg Address also sounded the theme of the United States as a single undivided nation rather than a union or confederation of States.  Wills shows how this theme too derives from the Declaration, when the people of the colonies rose up in unity to declare their Independence from Britain.  Wills also reminds the reader of the sources of the idea of Nationhood in American history. He alludes to the Federalism of Chief Justice John Marshall and Justice Joseph Story. In particular, Wills discusses the Webster-Hayne debates. Lincoln greatly admired Webster as well as his fellow Whig, Henry Clay.  Webster uttered the famous line \\"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable,\\" which resonates through the Gettysburg Address.<br />Wills tries to show the influence on Lincoln's thought on the transcendentalism of Emerson and of Theodore Parker.  I thought this one of the more challenging sections of the book. While the Declaration was born in the skepticism of British empiricism and of Deism, transcendentalism emphasized the ideal.  The Declaration and the Address, and the American mission, Lincoln transformed into ideal to be struggled for and realized by the living to commemorate the sacrifice of those who gave their lives to attain it.<br />The book also includes an excellent treatment of rhetoric and speech, tracing Lincoln's address back to Thucidides and Georgias and ending with the observation that it marked the beginning of modern American prose.<br />This book will encourage the reader to rethink and to understand the great nature of the American political experiment.undivided nation rather than a union or confederation of States.

US	48185764	R18K7QZ9T8B2S1	0890297649	971578165	Lee and Longstreet at Gettysburg	Books	4	10	10	N	N	A Study of the Confederate High Command at Gettysburg	Glenn Tucker was a newspaper reporter who covered the White House and an advertising executive.  He was also a student of the Civil War and, in the tradition of the amateur scholar, wrote several books which are still read including &quot;High Tide at Gettysburg&quot; (1958) and this sequel, &quot;Lee and Longstreet at Gettysburg&quot; (1968).<br />For years, many individuals devoted to the cause of the South and to the memory of General Robert E. Lee blamed General Longstreet, the commander of Lee's first corps and his leading subordinate, for the loss of the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1 -- July 3, 1863) and perhaps more broadly for the defeat of the Confederacy. Robert E. Lee and James Longstreet disagreed famously on the manner in which the Battle of Gettysburg was to be prosecuted.  The controversy over Lee and Longstreet at Gettysburg is basically three-fold: 1.  Some people blame the Confederate loss on Longstreet's alleged failure to attack the Union left early in the morning of July 2.  They allege that Lee had given orders for such an attack, and Longstreet dalliied until it was to late for the attack to be successful. 2.  Longstreet opposed the attack of the Federal left and tried to pursuade General Lee to march his army to the right around the Union army to get between the Union army and Washington D.C. and Baltimore.  3.  Longstreet opposed what proved to be the disastrous frontal charge -- the &quot;Pickett -Pettigrew -- Trimble charge&quot; on July 3.<br />Tucker's study reviews these charges in detail and sensibly and convincingly exonerates Longstreet.  With respect to the first charge, he finds that Lee issued no orders for an early morning attack.  He concludes that Longstreet moved his troops with more than reasonable dispatch under the circumstances and launched his attack, fortuitously, at the time it had the best chance of success.  The second and third charges involve the exercise of military judgment on the battle plan at Gettysburg.  Tucker, in the company of an increasing number of students of the battle, concludes that Longstreet had the better of it and the strategy more likely to lead to success at Gettysburg than the strategy that was pursued.  With Pickett's charge on July 3, the case is, alas, clear to make.  The matter is closer with respect to the July 2 strategy (Longstreet proposing to go around the Union army) but this too may have been the preferable course given the strength of the Union position on Cemetry Ridge.<br />Tucker documents the Lee -Longstreet disagreements well and, I think, fairly.  One of the more fascinating aspects of his book is his discussion of visits of President Eisenhower and Field Marshall Montgomery to Gettysburg to review the battle plans.  Both Generals were supportive of Longstreet's strategy and were strongly negative about Pickett's charge in particular.<br />There is much mterial in this book extraneous to the Lee-Longstreet controversy at Gettysburg.  The material includes extensive biographical sketches of Generals Lee, Longstreet, and Pickett, the last of which adds very little to understanding the battle. (Tucker dwells too long trying to show the authenticity of letters Pickett wrote to his fiance during the battle.) There are many anecdotes and side-stories which, while interesting in themselves, are somewhat padded and add little to an understanding of the roles of Lee and Longstreet in the Battle of Gettysburg.<br />Tucker tells his story from a Southern point of view.  He casts the war as a struggle between large centralized government and local self-determination and downplays severely, in my opinion, the role of slavery.  In his concluding chapter, he is critical of the reconstruction policy following the Civil War without explaining his criticisms in detail and, of course, without considering carefully the scholarly reconsideration of reconstruction, to which he alludes, that was beginning to make headway at about the time of his book.<br />Important as these matters are,  Tucker's discussion of the roles of Lee and Longstreet anticipates the views of much modern thinking on the Battle of Gettysburg. (Only a few years ago, Longstreet's contribution to the Southern effort at the Battle was memorialized by a statue.)  Tucker's book is a thoughtful study of leadership and will increase the reader's understanding of the Battle of Gettysburg and the Civil War.portant as these matters are,  Tucker's discussion of the roles of Lee and Longstreet anticipates the views of much modern thinking on the Battle of Gettysburg.

It provides endless materials for discussion on questions ranging from the reasons for the Confederacy's invasion of the North, the factors leading up to the battle, the strategy and tactics employed by the armies, how close the South came, or could have come, to achieving victory, and -- most importantly -- the significance of it all for our country.<br />Even with such recent studies of Gettysburg as those by Steven Sears (2003) and Noah Trudeau (2002) Tucker's 1958 book, &quot;High Tide at Gettysburg&quot; remains worth reading.  There are immeasurable perspectives on this battle.  I am finding that the reader can only work towards an understanding of it by reading several accounts.  Tucker's book is less detailed than are the studies of Sears and Trudeau.  But it is an easier read, it is well told, and it features many interesting biographical detail an many of the key figures of the battle.  In terms of getting a grasp of the complex military actions, it might be better for the reader to start with Tucker before approaching Sears or Trudeau.<br />Tucker differs from Sears and Trudeau in that he takes a pro-South perspective.  His focus is on the Army of Northern Virginia and on its heroics -- and its failures -- during the battle.  There are moments when I felt Tucker was downplaying the Union effort at the battle to such a degree that he thought that the ultimate success or failure of the Southern effort was entirely in the South's hands.  (Many years after the battle General George Pickett was asked why his charge failed.  He replied &quot;I think the Union Army had something to do with it.&quot;)<br />Tucker also takes a markedly Southern view of the meaning of the War.  He sees it as a War for Southern Independence which reached its high tide at Gettysburg.  He tells his story with drama and passion. He greatly downplays slavery as a motivating factor for the Civil War, contrary to most more recent accounts of Civil War History.  Again, he also tends to minimize the moral force of the Union's commitment, exemplified by the determination of President Lincoln to hold our country together as one nation rather than have it divide in two.<br />Tucker's approach is valuable because it emphasizes how people on both sides of the conflict were fighting for what they perceived as ideals.  This is sometimes forgotten in more recent accounts and it goes a considerably way to explain the ferocity of the fighting.  There is a great deal to be learned from Tucker as long as the reader approaches the book critically.<br />There has been endless discussion about why the Battle of Gettysburg turned out the way it did.  In the final chapter of his book Tucker offers a list of his reasons. His list is thoughtful if not particularly surprising to students of the battle.  The list will help the reader focus on the critical events of this fascinating battle and to reflect for him or herself on their meaning.Civil War, contrary to most more recent accounts of Civil War History.

It invites every reader to think and to work out for him or herself an understanding of the Battle and its significance.<br />Trudeau's work presents a comprehensive account of the Battle of Gettysburg, beginning with the factors which led to the Confederacy's second invasion of the North and concluding with President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address (November 19, 1863.)  He sees the invasion, and the Battle of Gettysburg, as an attempt by General Robert E.Lee to wage a &quot;war of annihilation&quot; by destroying the Union Army and forcing a recognition of Southern independence.  His account emphasizes the sheer ferocity and desperation of the fighting during these three terrible days (July 1 -- July 3, 1863) of the Battle.  The subtitle of the book, &quot;A Testing of Courage&quot; describes its theme succinctly as Trudeau focuses on the carnage and the fighting over tremendous odds and hardship by the two contending armies.  There was extraordinary heroism displayed by both sides during these days, by soldiers, by their officers and by civilians who witnessed the Battle.  Trudeau's account of the Battle focuses on the fighting, the valor, and the suffering of the participants.<br />Trudeau's book bears comparison with Steven Sears's comprehensive study of the Battle of Gettysburg published this year.  I found that Sears's book had the larger sweep.  The individual chapters are, on the whole, longer and Sears's account tends to show how the events of one day cascaded into the events of the next.  Also, Sears is much more prone to editorializing during the course of his narrative, offering the reader a point-by-point discussion of decisions by the armies' high commands.<br />Trudeau's account, in contrast, is more episodic.  His chapters tend to be shorter, and each chapter is punctated into short sections and paragraphs.  Trudeau shifts his scenes, as Sears does not, from one portion of the battle to another.  Thus, while giving the reader discussions of the progress of the Picket -- Pettigrew charge on July 3,  Trudeau shifts focus several times to discuss the development of the cavalry battle between Jeb Stuart and George Custer that went on at roughly the same time for tne Union rear.  As for the July 2 Battle, Trudeau tends to shift the reader's attention between the battle for the Union left and the battle for its right.  Trudeau is less prone that Sears to interrupt his narrative with editorializing about the various command decisions (although he does some of this) and more inclined to let the events of the day speak for themselves.<br />I think Trudeau spends more time than does Sears on day 2 of the Battle, particularly the uncoordinated yet fierce Southern attacks on the Union left; and Sears is more thorough on day 3.  Sears devotes a great deal of attention to Lee's retreat from Pennsylvania following the battle and to Meade's pursuit.  Trudeau's account is short on these matters.  Sears' account is sharper in is portrayal of the Lee - Longstreet disagreements over the conduct of the Battle and also makes more of the impact of Jeb Stuart's absence during the Pennsylvania campaign.  Thus in some ways, it takes a rather more holistic view of the Battle than does Trudeau's study.<br />I found both Trudeau's and Sears's accounts of the Battle of Gettysburg fascinating.  A reading of either book, or of both books, is time well spent.  The books will encourage the reader to think about the meaning of our Civil War and of the role of the tragedy of these days and years in forming our nation.pter is punctated into short sections and paragraphs.

US	48185764	R1XF1770CR0Y4O	0395867614	702211299	Gettysburg	Books	5	132	144	N	N	Sears's Gettysburg	The Civil War, particularly the Battle of Gettysburg, retains its hold on the imagination of Americans. We seek to understand our country by studying the events of these terrible but formative years.  The Civil War did indeed lead to a \\"new birth of freedom\\" in the United States.  We still struggle to understand and to develop the implications of this \\"new birth\\".<br />Stephen Sears is a distinguished military historian of the Civil War who has written in this book an outstanding account of the pivotal battle of Gettysburg (July 1 -- July 3, 1863). This battle ended the Confederacy's second invasion of the Union (the first invasion ended with the Battle of Antietam in September, 1862). Coupled with the Confederacy's surrender of Vicksburg, Mississippi on July 4, 1863, Gettysburg ended the South's ability to wage an offensive war and probaby ended as well its chance of winning the war.<br />Sears gives a full account of the battle and of the events leading to Lee's second invasion of the North, beginning with Lee's victory over the Union Army at Chancellorsville in May, 1863. Sears explains well how the invasion was linked to the impending Confederate loss at Vicksburg.  General Lee put forward the invasion to Jefferson Davis as a calculated gamble and a means to counteract this loss.<br />The book offers detailed pictures of the march into Pennsylvania of the preludes to the Battle of Gettysburg, of the battle itself, and of Lee's subsequent retreat into Virginia. There are excellent pictures of each of the three days of the battle, beginning with the two great armies stumbling on each other on day one, continuing with the ferocity of the Southern charge on the Union left (Little Round Top) on day two, and concluding climactically with General George Pickett's doomed charge at the center of the Union line on day three. I found the story of Pickett's charge dramiatically and poignantly told. The book describes Lee's retreat and Meade's pursuit into Virginia following the battle. Sears, in general, exonerates Meade from the charge that he failed to pursue Lee adequately following the battle, to destroy Lee's army, and to bring the War to an end.<br />At least as important as the factual development of the events of the campaign, Sears gives the reader an analysis of why events developed as they did. In particular, Sears views the battle as a result of Southern overconfidence and arrogance -- hubris -- resulting from the many victories attained by the Army of Northern Virginia in the early years of the War. General Lee felt contempt for the fighting spirit of the Union Army and for its leaders which led him to underestimate the spirit of the Federals, especially when they were called upon to defend their own land.<br />Sears also points out many failures in the Confederate High Command during the invasion. The primary failure, I believe, involved Lee and his cavalry commander Jeb Stuart. Stuart left the invading army at a critical time and as a result Lee was deprived of knowledge of the whereabouts of the Union Army, its size, and of the terrain at Gettysburg. The Union enjoyed an overwhelming field position during the second and third days of Gettysburg.<br />There is a great deal made in Sears's' book of Lee's relationships with his other generals, particularly General James Longstreet. Longstreet objected vigorously to Lee's plans of battle on the second and third days, even while carrying out faithfully and aggressively his duties as a subordinate officer when the decisions had been made.<br />Sears contrasts the Southern command with that of the Union commander, George Meade, who had assumed command only four days before the battle. Meade was cautious and thorough. He assumed personal command of the Union operations at Gettysburg (unlike Lee who delegated heavily), consulted with and listened to his subordinates, and performed both brilliantly and stolidly at the time of the Union's great need.<br />The writing style of this book is outstanding. It flows inexorably from one chapter to the next and from event to event. The reader can follow the story, from the complexities of the troop movements, to Sears's discussions and reflections on his story. It is a style suited to a prose epic, and it kept me riveted throughout.<br />This is an excellent treatment of the Battle of Gettysburg.s book is outstanding.

Senhor Jose, age 50, is a clerk in the National Registry of a large, unidentified, city.  His job is to record deaths, births, marriages, divorces on official documents covering the living and the dead of the city. The work is dull and routine. Senhor Jose is a confirmed bachelor, stuck in his habits, with no friends.  He amuses himself by clipping newspaper articles and other information on famous people.<br /><br />In the course of pursuing his hobby, Senhor Jose comes across the record of a 36 year old woman who has recently divorced.  The novel turns upon Senhor Jose's attempt to find this woman and upon his motivation for doing so.<br /><br />The story is told in a surrealistic, allegorical, Kafkaesque way.  It is written in long, unbroken sentences and paragraphs which do not stop for details such as quotation marks.  This style is effective because it allows the reader to enter into Senhor Jose's mind and into the minds of the many characters he encounters along the way of his search. The tone of the writing varies from sharply ironic to deeply serious and reflective. There is also a startling change of voicing in the book from third to first person in one pivotal passage which is not fully explained until the end of the story.<br /><br />The novel is one of spiritual seeking with many astonishing characters assisting Senhor Jose in his quest.  The characters include the Registrar at the National Registry, a Shepherd at a cemetry, and the ceiling (!) in Senhor Jose's apartment.<br /><br />I found the story moving in its description of the need for human love and connectedness. Near the end of the book, Senhor Jose discusses the nature of his quest for the unknown woman.  He is told that he loves her even though she is a person he has never met:  &quot;You wanted to see her, you wanted to know her, and that, whether you like it or not, is love.&quot; (p. 211)  At the very end of the book, Senhor Jose himself observes, in discussing the activities of the shepherd at the cemetery in rearranging identification markers on tombstones: &quot;it's all to do with knowing where the people we're looking for really are, he thinks we'll never know.&quot; (p. 237)<br /><br />In his strange quest, Senhor Jose, and the reader, have learned something of the mystery of human love, and of the connection that binds the living and the dead.ever met:  &quot;You wanted to see her, you wanted to know her, and that, whether you like it or not, is love.&quot; (p. 211)  At the very end of the book, Senhor Jose himself observes, in discussing the activities of the shepherd at the cemetery in rearranging identification markers on tombstones: &quot;it's all to do with knowing where the people we're looking for really are, he thinks we'll never know.&quot; (p. 237)<br /><br />In his strange quest, Senhor Jose, and the reader, have learned something of the mystery of human love, and of the connection that binds the living and the dead.	2003-07-30
US	48185764	R1MCJL0FY6N3YO	0060099275	939279471	The Story of Buddhism: A Concise Guide to Its History & Teachings	Books	4	27	28	N	N	A Scholar's Introduction to Buddhism	Donald Lopez, a professor of Buddhist and Tibetan Studies at the University of Michigan, is one of the best scholars who attempt to present a balanced, accurate picture of Buddhism as it has been practiced over the generations.  His book &quot;The Story of Buddhism&quot; considers the actual practice of Buddhism, in all its diverse forms, in Asia, superstitions, magic, idiosyncracies, and all.  In this way, it differs from most books that present Buddhism to Americans.  These books typically focus on meditation, on the liberating, non-theistic character of the Buddha's teaching, and of Buddhism as a guide to life in the difficulties of secular 20th and 21st century America.  Such works are valuable and important, but they fail to give the reader a historical sense of Buddhism.<br />Lopez's book opens with a short treatment of Buddhist cosmology, including its picture of the universe, the earth, and the heavens and hells. There is an all-to-brief discussion of the key Buddhist teaching of Dependent Origination.<br />The chapter on cosmology is followed by a discussion of the life of the Buddha, taken from a wide variety of textual sources, of the Dharma, Monasticism, Lay Life, and Enlightenment.<br />The focus of the book is on the various schools of Mahayana Buddhism and on the Buddhism of Tibet.  I found surprisingly little discussion of Theravada Buddhism, (practiced historically in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand) which is likely the earliest version of Buddhism we have today.  Lopez describes well how various Mahayana thinkers broke away from earlier teachings but doesn't tell us much about these early teachings themselves.<br />There is a great deal of emphasis in the book on how the Buddha's teaching was applied and modified over the years.  Most of lay practice, Lopez informs us, was devoted to the accumulation of merit by the practice of good deeds.  A regular meditation practice, much less textual study of the Sutras, was simply unavailable to most people who have over the generations called themselves Buddhists, either laity or monastic.<br />Lopez describes well the ritualistic practices of any number of Buddhist schools, emphasisizing matters such as relic worship, ancestor worship, fortune-telling and horoscopes, miracle cures,  magic, mandalas, and what the modern reader is likely to view as superstition.  He briefly describes for the reader a number of Buddhist schools and practices,including Tantric Buddhism, the Pure Land School, and Zen, and their different paths to enlightenment.  There is a wonderfully detailed picture of a ritual involving the Heart Sutra, repeated many times, with the use of icons and statues.<br />This book is a welcome, clear-minded corrective to those who approach Buddhism ahistorically.  But there is, indeed, more to the story than this, as Professor Lopez realizes.  For all his objectivity, I think Lopez has some grasp of the power of the Buddha's message which has led many to it, including modern Americans, over the millenia. This is most clearly indicated in the final paragraph of Professor Lopez's book.  He writes (p. 256)<br />&quot; But there is also another challenge, the challenge provided by the dharma, which makes the remarkable claim that it is possible to live a life untainted by what are called the eight worldly concerns: gain and loss, fame and disgrace, praise and blame, happiness and sorrow.&quot;<br />This is a worthwhile critical introduction to an endlessly fascinating teaching.ve over the generations called themselves Buddhists, either laity or monastic.<br />Lopez describes well the ritualistic practices of any number of Buddhist schools, emphasisizing matters such as relic worship, ancestor worship, fortune-telling and horoscopes, miracle cures,  magic, mandalas, and what the modern reader is likely to view as superstition.

US	48185764	R32VVJFD63O48U	0807118613	951564020	The Last Citadel: Petersburg, Virginia, June 1864-April 1865	Books	4	23	23	N	N	The Siege of Petersburg	I was moved to read this book by a recent visit to the Petersburg National Battlefield in Virginia.  I spent the better part of a weekend touring various parts of the Battlefield with  Park Rangers, but I still came away confused.  The siege lines are lengthy and the key locations of the battle are separated and distant from each other. (I got lost several times driving.)<br />For some battlefields I have seen, such as Gettysburg, Antietam, Shiloh, or Vicksburg, a vist can illuminate and can be more informative than a casual reading of several books. For Petersburg, the reverse is true. I think this is due to the length of the siege (from June 1864-April 1865), to the complexity of the military operations, and to the interrelationship of the Petersburg siege with activites elswhere, particularly Sheridan's raids in the Shenendoah Valley and Sherman's taking of Atlanta and March to the sea.  I found I needed to hold these events in mind in understanding the siege, rather than simply view the battlefield.  Trudeau's book, which I found during my visit to Petersburg, helped me to do this.<br />Noah Andre Trudeau's \\"The Last Citadel\\"  explains the Petersburg Siege and places it in its context in ending the Civil War.  Perhaps most importantly for me, he explains how the decisive event of the siege occurred before it even began: Grant's brilliant move following the Union disaster at Cold Harbor, in which he stole a march on General Lee, crossed the James River, (a risky and audacious move) and attacked Petersburg from the South. Lee had forseen this move. He told Confederate General Jubal Early at Cold Harbor that: \\"we must destroy this army of Grant's before he gets to the James River.  If he gets there it will become a siege, and then it will be a mere question of time.\\" These were prophetic words but Lee was unable to react quickly enough when Grant moved his army from its trenches at Cold Harbor and crossed the James River.<br />The object of the siege was to capture the City of Petersburg and then move on the Confederate capitol of Richmond from the South.  The siege itself was combined, as Trudeau shows, with operations directly on Richmond, staged from an area slightly north of Petersburg called the Bermuda Hundred.  When Petersburg fell at last, the Union moved immediately into Richmond.  General Lee surrendered at Appatomatox only one week later.<br />Trudeau's book is divided into four large Parts, together with a Prologue and an Epilogue.  The book covers the early days of the siege (Petersburg probably could have been taken immediately after Grant crossed the James River with more aggressive efforts from the Union commanders), the famous incident of the Crater, operations against the southern railroads providing supplies to Petersburg, southern attempts to break the siege, the long, weary winter of the siege, and much else.  Each part of the book begins with a short quotation from General Grant's \\"Final Report of Operations, March 1864 -- May, 1865\\". The four parts are each divided into short chapters which are, in turn, subdivided by short bold-faced headings each highlighting a critical moment or event.  Thus the scene shifts rapidly from the Union lines to those of the South, from General Grant's deliberations to those of General Lee, from the battles to the trenches.  It is, on the whole, an effective means of presenting the story.  It held my attention and helped me understand the sometimes confusing sequences of events.<br />There are excellent discussions of the famous Battle of the Crater and of General Lee's numerous attempts to take the initiative and break the siege.  I found the best and most poignant writing in Part IV of the book which details the breaking of the Confederate lines in April, 1865.  Trudeau explains how Lee's lines were simply stretched too thin and how Grant after laboring to create this situation,  was able to exploit it with an all-out assault.  There is a good treatment of the battle ofFive Forks, which led to the break -- this discussion occurs at the end of the chapter rather than at the beginning.  I viewed and heard a discussion of the Five Forks site during my visit to Petersburg --  Five Forks is some distance from most of the rest of the Battlefield -- But I didn't really understand the significance of the site until I read Trudeau's book.<br />There are eloquent accounts of the evacuation of Petersburg and of visits during the siege by President Lincoln.  Trudeau's Epilogue is thoughtful and a good summation of the book and the siege.<br />The maps in the book were helpful. And I particularly enjoyed the many drawings and illustrations in the book.  These illustrations were made contemporaneously with the events they describe and have not often been reproduced.<br />This book is a good account of a critical but sometimes underestimated battle in our country's Civil War.of Five Forks, which led to the break -- this discussion occurs at the end of the chapter rather than at the beginning.

US	48185764	R3BWM04KK7DUKA	0141001763	855770597	Ravelstein (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Ravelstein and Chick	\\"Ravelstein\\" (2000) is a novel-memoir of the friendship between Allan Bloom and the author, Saul Bellow.  In addition to exploring the friendship of the two men, the book's primary themes, to me, are the nature of love and facing death, one's own and those dear to one.<br />In the novel, Abe Ravelstein is based upon Allan Bloom, a professor of political philosophy at the University of Chicago and a student of Leo Strauss (called Davorr in the book).  Professor Bloom became wealthy when his 1987 book, \\"The Closing of the American Mind\\" became an unexpected best-seller.  Bloom's book stresses the importance of philosophy and the humanities, particularly the philosophy of Plato, if education is to meet its function of forming thoughtful, passionate, and autonomous persons.  He sharply criticized higher education in the United States, together with most of pop culture, for its failure to acknowledge or to pursue these goals.  Bloom grew up in a Jewish family in the midwest.<br />Like Bloom, Saul Bellow grew up in a Jewish family in the midwest.  Unlike Bloom, recognition came to Bellow relatively early in his career as a novelist.  Bellow received the Nobel Prize in 1976. He has won three National Book Awards and the Pulitzer Prize.<br />The two men became fast friends relatively late in life and \\"Ravelstein\\" (2000) is a record of their friendship written by Bellow (born 1915) in his mid-80s.  A painter with words, Bellow in a short space gives the reader an unforgettable picture of Ravelstein.  The book disclaims an attempt to deal with Ravelstein's thought.  But I think Bellow captures a great deal of it when he emphasizes how students must learn to leave home and the familiar and try to think for themselves.  The picture of Ravelstein is larger than life, as Bellow gives us a passionate, expressive individual with most expensive tastes, a strong ego, a ribald sense of humor, and a passion for promiscuous homosexual sex.  The book poignantly shows the reader Ravelstein's lingering death from AIDS.<br />We meet Bellow (Chick) in the book in the midst of an unhappy marriage to a woman named Vela.  Vela is a world-renowned physicist but, to hear Chick tell it, she has little time for or interest in him.  Chick and Vela are in the midst of a divorce when one of Ravelstein's young students, Rosamund,falls in love with him.  Chick suffers a near-miss with death in an illness and Rosamund helps pull thim through.  The book presents a picture of the nature of love, I think, in the contrasts between the Chick -Vela and the Chick-Rosamund relationships.  Ravelstein too has much to say about the nature of love, in his own voice and in the voice of his philosophical master, Plato, in the Symposium and the Phaedrus.<br />Friendship for Plato and Aristotle and for Bloom is the meeting of congenial minds with a common purpose.  We see such friendship in \\"Ravelstein\\" in an interest in the life of the mind but we see something much more earthy too.  Ravelstein and Chick are full of the life of the American midwest, of Vaudeville, of spicy humor, and of smutty language and stories. They enjoy each other's company and are able to be honest with each other -- even when each man has something painfully unpleasant to say about the other.  They also share a common American Jewish heritage, both as it deals with secular American life and as a response to the Holocaust, which gets explored in substantial detail in this book.  The two men reflect on death and on immortality, given Ravelstein's awareness of his own impending death and the aging Chick's close call with death.<br />This is a book of Bellow's old age.  I think it will be remembered.  The book will also, I think, keep alive the memory and teachings of Allan Bloom, as a person and as a teacher. The accomplishments and the names of Bloom and Bellow will be inextricably linked for many readers as a result of Bellow's story of their friendship.in's lingering death from AIDS.<br />We meet Bellow (Chick) in the book in the midst of an unhappy marriage to a woman named Vela.

It is an outstanding work combining polemic against the diminution of American standards with serious thought about how we came to this impasse.  Bloom's book is a testament to the power of ideas.<br />If \\"The Closing of the American Mind\\" captures Bloom's thought, his friend Saul Bellow's novel, \\"Ravelstein\\" (1996) captures much of Bloom the man.  I think Bloom's book and Bellow's novel will be permanently intertwined in the history of American thought and literature.  It is difficult to think of one without reflecting on the other.<br />The themes of Professor Bloom's study are stated in its title and, more explicitly, in the subtitle of the book: \\"How Higher Education has failed Democracy and Impoverished the Soul's of Today's Students.\\"  I tried to capture these themes in the title of this review: Education, Democracy, and Soul.<br />The first theme of the book is education. Professor Bloom argues that American higher education has lost its sense of purpose and direction.  He finds this due to an emphasis on relativism and toleration and a reluctance to focus on questions of purpose and meaning.  Similarly, Professor Bloom finds American education has become overly politicized and attuned to the concerns of the moment.  He urges that liberal education return to its initial function of searching for wisdom and for self-knowledge. While not every student need pursue the liberal arts (in fact, it is a rare enterprise), Bloom finds that these studies must be available for those interested, and honored, if University education is to produce thoughtful human beings and an informed community holding values and the pursuit of truth in common.  Bloom finds the source of liberal studies in ancient Greece with Socrates and his great student, Plato.<br />The second theme of the book is democracy, and American constitutionalism.  American democracy remains a precious experiment and Bloom traces its roots to enlightenment thought, particularly in John Locke.  The basic values of our system are liberty and equality.  Bloom ties democratic values into a society devoted to the pursuit of empirical knowledge rather than superstition.  He returns frequently in his book to Alexis de Touqueville's \\"Democracy and America\\" which captured a great deal of the promise of our country while warning of the levelling and conformity that would result from an unchecked, uncritical approach to a sociey in which each person's opinions counted as much as each other person's.  There is much fascinating but difficult material in this book about German anti-rationalists beginning with Nietzsche and proceeding through Max Weber and Heidegger.  These thinkers espoused theories, Bloom argues, fundamentally at odds with American democracy.  Their theories have been vulgarized and watered-down and form the basis, Bloom argues, for the preoccupations of modern America with \\"life-styles\\" and \\"commitments\\" rather than reason.  Bloom's historical discussions are difficult and move rather too quickly at times, but they are thoughtful and rewarding.<br />The third theme of the book is soul.  For Bloom, soul is what our young people and our country are in danger of losing.  Soul is at first blush exemplified by the Socratic pursuit.  It is a conviction that some things are worth knowing and pursuing and it is an attempt to find them through serious enterprise.  Soul is a matter of love, passion and effort.  Bloom finds \\"soul\\" compromised by an attitude of relativism, of too easy commitments, and of a desire to compromise somewhat too easily in matters of love to attain the necessity of sex.  Lack of soul, for Bloom, is exemplified in the pursuit of rock music by the young and not-so-young as an attempt to find an emotional high without the attendant spiritual and intellectual effort.<br />This book is difficult reading and there are moments when the polemics get in the way of the thought.  This notwitstanding, the book is a passionate and deeply informed treatment of the life of the mind and sprit.get in the way of the thought.

Gardner wrote the screenplay for the movie, directed by John Huston, in 1972. The book remains in print in a series of novels based in California called \\"California fiction\\".  I came upon this book by chance.  It is little-known but a treasure.<br />The book is about boxing and low life, faded dreams, lack of prospects, booze, rooming houses, failed relationships in a small California town.  The two primary characters are Billy Tully and Ernie Munger.  Billy at age 29 is a washed-up fighter who has lost his wife and several jobs and is sinking deeply into alcohol and oblivion.  Ernie is 19 years old and a boxer who may have potential. He marries a young women named Faye, after getting her pregnant, and takes up the ring as a professional in order to support his wife and child.<br />The paths of the two men cross in the gym at the beginning of the book and their careers take parallel courses.  Billy had lost an important fight in Panama some years earlier when his manager, Ruben Luna, forced him to travel alone to Panama in order to save on expenses.  He makes an attempted comeback at the age of 30 and actually wins a decision in a brutal match with an aging Mexican fighter.  He returns to fighting to try to save himself from depression over the loss of his wife, his lack of prospects, and his loneliness.<br />Ernie Munger is young and works at a gas station. Although he has some boxing potential, his skills appear limited.  As had been the case with Tully years earlier, Ruben Luna sends Munger out of town, (to Las Vegas) for a fight to save on the expenses.  This is Munger's first professional fight which proves more successful for him than did Tully's fight in Panama.<br />The book ends darkly, but with a hint of the possiblity of personal growth and true independence for Munger.<br />The descriptions in this book of bars, of women, of cheap hotels, of the training for fights, and of the fights themselves is compelling.  This is a strong picture of boxing at its seamiest which yet captures the fascination that this sport holds for many -- myself included.<br />There are also many scenes in the book of the life of seasonal, agricultural workers in northern California.  One of the most memorable portions of the book occurs when Tully and Munger sign on for day work in picking nuts. Tully climbs upon a ladder on a tractor and beats the nuts from a tree with a stick where they fall on Munger's head as he gathers them into a bag.  The rage and the frustration of both men is palpable.<br />Gardner writes with a spare understated style which does not moralize.  The characters and their experiences speak for themselves.  It is highly effective.<br />There is a picture here of despairing men with small visions but also a real sense of underlying humanity, of hope, and of valuable, if fallen ideals.

US	48185764	RQ2QQCM2JTM9V	0826513131	599458199	His Glassy Essence: An Autobiography of Charles Sanders Peirce (The Vanderbilt Library of American Philosophy)	Books	4	10	10	N	N	An American Philosopher in the Grand Manner	Charles Sanders Peirce (1839 -1914) was an eccentric American genius and the founder of the philosophy generally known as pragmatism.  A difficult, erratic, and sometimes violent man, he was denied in his attempts to secure an academic position and spent the last several years of his life in near isolation at his home, called Arisbe, near Milford, Pennsylvania. Peirce may be America's most significant philosopher.  Yet he never produced a book.  His reputation, insofar as it is based on his written work, is based on essays he wrote throughout his life and on large manuscripts which his admirers saw through to publication beginning shortly after his death.<br />Professor Kenneth Ketner, the author of this \\"autobiography\\" of Peirce, is an acknoledged authority on Peirce's life and thought. He calls this book, \\"His Glassy Essence\\" an \\"autobiography\\" because it is based in large part upon a selection of Peirce's writings and letters arranged to tell the story of his life.  As Professor Ketner states, however, the book is also in part fiction.  It includes three fictitious characters, the narrator, Ike, a writer of mysteries, his wife Betsey, a nurse, and Roy, a Harvard PhD in philosophy who allegedly knew and studied with Peirce.  The story line involves Ike taking an interest in Peirce based upon an old box of Peirce's papers that Betsey has inherited.  Roy comes into the story to provide information about Peirce and, not accidentally, some excellent discussions on the nature of philosophy.<br />The mechanism creaks at times.  The story line is artificial although Roy has many insightful things to say in commenting on Peirce.  It is difficult to separate fact from fiction in the account of Peirce because many of his letters and essays seem to be melded together from sources written at different times and places.  Ketner's protestations notwithstanding, it is difficult to be convinced of the accuracy of the account presented here as scholarly biography.  Finally, this book covers essentially only the first 28 years of Peirce's life (with forwards to his death and to some of his subsequent writings.) There are two promised sequels which are to continue the story through the remainder of Peirce's life.<br />For all the difficulties, I came away from this book with a better understanding of Peirce and some inkling of the development of his thought.  Peirce's own distinctive ideas beging to be developed only in the last third or so of this book.  The earlier sections deal largely with Peirce's years in college when he was deeply under the influence of Kant.<br />The book makes a good case that Peirce's work is narrowed unduly when he is viewed simply as one of the first American pragmatists.  He was in fact a philosopher in the large manner concerned about science, about logic and categories in an expansive sense of these terms, and about God. He was an empiricist in the broadest sense that William James developed with his term \\"radical empiricism\\".  I also see strong parallels in the account of Peirce given in this book to Husserl's phenomenology.<br />Peirce tought the distinction between knowledge, or the accumulation of facts, and wisdom and meaning which cannot be learned from the books.  He developed the philosophy of signs called semiotics and invented a personal and highly idiosyncratic philosophical vocabulary, including terms such as \\"Cenopythagoreanism\\" (see page 342) which stretch the casual reader' patience and may stretch the more serious reader's mind.<br />This book gives an excellent picture of the philosophic mind, in the person of Charles Peirce, and of the serious and consuming nature of philosophic inquiry.  It is not a book to read for a full account either of Peirce's life or his thought.  It does capture something of the spirit of the man and the thinker.<br />Readers who want a historically based account of Peirce and his times might enjoy \\"The Metaphysical Club\\" by Louis Menand. Ketner's book is cited in thereferences for Menand and it covers much of the same ground, Peirce's life, his relationship to his father, the mathematician Benjamin Peirce, the metaphysical club which met briefly at Harvard in the 1870s, the effect of the Civil War on American pragmatism, and much else.  The distinctive value of Ketner's book, I think, is that for all its problems it will allow the reader to see Peirce from the inside out.references for Menand and it covers much of the same ground, Peirce's life, his relationship to his father, the mathematician Benjamin Peirce, the metaphysical club which met briefly at Harvard in the 1870s, the effect of the Civil War on American pragmatism, and much else.

It is full of myth, poetry, insight and thought.  Even more than is the case with most of Plato, it is difficult to pin this work down to consider it as a treatise on a single subject matter.  The dialogue form and Plato's own thinking do not allow such reduction.  Broadly speaking, the dialogue deals with the nature of love with this question threaded in with a discussion of the nature of speech and writing and their respective roles in thinking about important questions (such as the nature of love.) The main body of the dialogue consists of three speeches, one a written speech by Lysias, and two oral speeches by Socrates.  The speech by Lysias and the first speech of Socrates argue that it is more advangateous for a young person to be wooed by a person who does not love him.  Socrates second speech, the pivotal portion of the dialogue, strongly takes issue with this in a discussion of the nature of love, passion (madness), the human soul, and the world of Platonic form.<br />Graeme Nicholson is a professor of philosophy at the University of Toronto and a fellow of Trinity College.  His book is a study of the Phaedrus prepared as part of a series of Purdue University Press' History of Philosophy Series, each volume of which is devoted to a detailed consideration of a specific philosophical text.  The Phaedrus has received such consideration in other studies (by Charles Griswold, Luc Brisson, Seth Bernadette, among other scholars), but the work is inexhaustible and well deserves the extended treatment it receives here.  Nicholson, properly and commendably, philosophizes with Plato.  He sees the ancient character of the texts but does not stop there.  He tries to show how the Phaedrus, with all its antiquity, addresses problems of modern readers in an important an elucidating way.<br />Nicholson's focus is on the nature of love.  Many readers understand Plato to argue that eros is a step on the way to a broader, rationalistic understanding of the ideas.  But Nicholson argues well that the Phaedrus reverses this pattern.  Plato here sees eros and passion - a commitment to study and to understanding and a fire within one -- as a precondition to any serious endeavor, philosophical or otherwise. Nicholson proceeds to show how this understanding of eros allows Plato in the Phaedrus to take a broader view of the nature of myth, poetry, rhetoric, and music as themselves contributing to and enabling the process of philosophical understanding.  I find this a valuable insight into the Phaedrus.<br />Nicholson also has challenging things to say about Plato's concept of being (or of being-beyond-being).  He sees this as a spritual and valuable concept, to simplify broadly, and as an important and, with current explanations and explications, viable antidote to much of the scientism and materialism in contemporary thought and in the assumptions of many people. This too is a valuable and thoughtful way of approaching the Phaedrus.<br />The core of Professor Nicholson's study is Socrates's great speech on love which he presents in Part II of the book in a fresh translation.  This translation is followed by a long, careful, exploration in Part III of the various themes of the book.  Part I of the book gives backround on Plato and on the Phaedrus's relationship to Plato's body of work.  There are introductory chapters on myth, rhetoric, dialectic, and writing.  All these themes are important to the Phaedrus and they are developed with good use of authority to other Platonic and Greek texts, and to the work of modern philosophers and scholars.<br />The book suffers somewhat but ignoring Plato's own order of presentation.  There is this a lack of attention to the dramatic development -- to the manner in which Plato tries to show the interrelationship of the themes of the Phaedrus -- how one leads into another.  This is no small task.  Thus in the early sections of the book, ProfessorNicholson discusses themes that Plato reserves for the end of the dialogue -- such as the nature of dialectic and the relative merits of writing and discussion. (The story of the god Theuth and his gift of writing to the King of Egypt is discussed early in Nicholson, for example, but it appears only at the end of the Phaedrus.)  The presentation thus misses some of the opportunities to discuss how Plato and the reader should view the development of the themes in the dialogue.<br />It is good to read the Phaedrus -- or to reread it as the case may be -- in the context of reading and studying this book.  I thought the book helped me understand and appreciate the Phaedrus and Plato.

I recently had the opportunity to read the book again, with Leithauser's essay serving as an introduction.  A single reading cannot exhaust this outsize, obscure novel by the 1955 Nobel-prize winner from Iceland.<br />On a simple level, \\"Independent People\\" deals with the lives of the poor sheep grazers in Iceland early in the 20th Century.  The hero is a farmer named Bajartur of Summerhouses who, after 18 years of working for another, the baliff, earns enough money to buy his own small farm.  Bajartur's goal is to be independent and self-sufficient, to take what he earns and not take or give to others.  In addition to this simple economic credo for independence. Bjartur is an \\"independent person\\" emotionally in his relationships with his wives -- he is twice married in the book -- his three sons and his daughter -- actually his first wife's daughter but not Bjartur's -- whom Bjartur names Asta Sollija the \\"beloved sun -lily\\" whom he refers to as his soul's \\"one flower.\\"  Much of this long, multi-faceted book involves Bjartur's relationship with Asta Sollija -- their estrangement and ultimate reconciliation.<br />Bjartur and Asta Sollija and their relationship frames but hardly exhausts this book.  There is a picture of Iceland -- or of modernizing society in general with its conflict between farmer and town.  There are long discussions of poetry and literature, of war, of politics, and particularly of philosophy and religion, see below.  For all its length and seriousness, much of the book is funny, almost satirical in tone in the way it pokes fun at Bjartur and his intellectual and emotional limitations.  The reader still comes to admire Bjartur for his fortitude and stubborness.<br />The book is timeless in character and the chronology is blurred.  World War I plays a pivotal role in the middle of the book but the times before and the times after seem to be endless and undefined.  There is something that is prototypical and archetypical about this book -- it is hardly an exercise in the realistic novel.<br />From a subsequent essay about Laxness by Brad Leithauser, I learned that Laxness was the kind of person generally called a seeker.  This made me admire him and this book all the more and informed greatly my second reading.  Growing up in a small, isolated nation, Laxness read exhaustively and put something of himself into his readings.  He changed his mind many times during his life, being at various stages entirely secular, a socialist with perhaps communist leanings, and an adherent of various forms of Christianity. He took a rare delight in important ideas and showed an openness and fluidity to them that I find reflected in the themes of \\"Independent People.\\"  Most obviously, their is Bjartur's character with its emphasis on economic self-sufficiency and laissez-faire. This attitude leads to Bjartur's heroism but also his poverty, and it is contrasted artfully with the cooperative movemement and, implicitly, with a socialist approach to society in the early 20th century.<br />The book is pervaded by a strong spiritual tone.  Bjartur for most of the book represents a position of independence and utter skepticism, but at key moments he does things not fully consistent with his stated beliefs.  The book is framed by old Icelandic pagan legends and by spirits who are said to continue to haunt Bjartur's farm.  We see various Christian ministers who in general are satirized in the course of the novel.  But I was most impressed with the following erudite, and well-taken reference to Zoroastrianism, the religion of good and evil,which is alluded to many times during the course of the book and frames its story.  In a moment of irony, Laxness puts the following speech early on, at Bjartur's first wedding, into the mouth of the bailiff's wife.<br />\\"I don't know whether you are aquainted with the religious beliefs of the Persians.  This race believed that the god of light and the god of darkness waged eternal warfare, and that man's part was to assist the god of light in his struggle by the tilling of the fields and the improvement of the land.  This is precisely what farmers do.  They help God, if one may say so; work with God in the cultivation of plants, the tending of livestock, and the care of their fellow men.  There exists no calling of greater nobility here on earth.  Therefore, I would direct these words to all husbandmen, but first and foremost to our bridegroom of today: You sons of the soil whose labour is unending and leisure scanty, know, I bid you, how exalted is your vocation.  Agriculture is work in co-operation with the Creator Himself, and in you is He well pleased.\\" (p. 25)<br />I am intrigued by the repeated references to the \\"religion of the Persians\\" and to its appropriateness for the story.  This quote,and its irony, reminds me of the sermon in \\"Moby Dick\\", a book which shares in its obscurity and in its questing character many of the qualities of this one.  The speech shows the author's ability to adopt material from little-known traditions into his own ideas and work, and to make them live for the reader.  It was one of the qualities that leapt out at me in my second reading of \\"Independent People.\\"<br />This book remains a little-known masterpiece.  It will reward those readers willing to take the time with it.jartur's first wedding, into the mouth of the bailiff's wife.<br />\\"I don't know whether you are aquainted with the religious beliefs of the Persians.

He believed in one God, called Ahura Mazda, in a struggle with the forces of darkness.  He was a theological monist and an ethical dualist. Human beings had the responsibility of working to bring about the good and eliminate the evil.  The good would triumph in the end.  Zoroaster was one of the first religious teachers to preach the afterlife.  He founded a religion called Zoroastrianism which remains one of the fundamental religions of man and, although it has relatively few adherents, it survives today.<br />Paul Kriwaczek has written a fine book which is travelog, political commentary, history, and study of Zoroastrianism all rolled into one.  Mr. Kriwaczek was trained as a dentist but subsequently joined BBC as a specialist in Central and South Asian affairs.  It is good to see a nonspecialist who can write on Zoroaster with enthusiasm and knowledge and convey something of both to his readers.<br />The book is written in the form of a reverse chronology beginning with the present-day and progressing through successive chapters to the hazy early days (perhaps 1800 B.C.) of Zarathustra himself.  We see many interesting figures along the way, and Kriwaczek is full of entertaining stories and digressions.  This mostly makes the book a pleasure to read, but there are moments when the organization becomes confusing and the story gets a bit off track.<br />Kriwaczek spends a great deal of time on Frederich Nietzsche and his famous work \\"Thus Spake Zarathustra.\\"  He explains well the sources of Nietzsche's fascination with the ancient Persian prophet and he discusses the advances in scholarship contemporary with Nietzsche that helped make Zoroaster accessible.<br />The book continues with a mixture of travel, history, and philosophy through a discussion of the Albegensians, the religion of Mani, Mithraism, Cyrus the Great, and the Jews during the period of the Babylonian Exile and the Second Temple.<br />There are outstanding color photograhps illustrating the places and sites discussed in the book.  Kriwazeck's treatments make no pretense of being scholarly or complete.  But they are, on the whole, eloquent and thought-provoking.  I enjoyed particularly the discussion of Mani, a reformer of Zorastrianims who gave his name to Manicheanism. Kriwazeck's account is based in part upon a recent novel, \\"The Gardens of Light\\" by the Lebanese author, Amin Maalouf.<br />Kriwazeck concludes that Zoroaster continues to have a great deal to teach. He sees Zoroaster has a predecessor of the \\"American religion\\"  or \\"universal religion\\" (pp. 227-228) which emphasizes ecumenisism and toleration in a large society composed of individuals from diverse backrounds.  Kriwazeck writes (p.228) that the Universal religion:<br />\\"comprises a belief in good and evil, angels, the devil, heaven and hell, the coming of a Messiah, and an eventual end of the world.  These are beliefs with which Jews, Christians and Muslims can all agree-- as well as that majority who do not claim to believe in any particular religion.  Every one of these ideas first appeared in Zarathustra's teaching long before the start of recorded history, a message as influential today as it ever was.\\"<br />Kriwaczek has written a fine popular study of Zoroaster.

His relationship to American music seems to me roughly parallel to Walt Whitman's relationship to American poetry and to Charles Peirce's relationship to American philosophy. Like Peirce, Ives was little-known during his lifetime. Furthermore, while many people may be aware of Peirce and of Ives, a much smaller number have much acquaintance with their works.<br /><br />Ives was born in Danbury, Connecticut and remained throughout his life attached to his vision of the post-Civil War small-town New England of his childhood. His father, George Ives, was a bandmaster and the greatest influence on Ives's life. Ives was a musical prodigy who began composing at an early age, quickly picking up experimental styles. He showed great proficiency at the piano and organ. (Through young manhood, he worked Sundays as a church organist.) He studied music at Yale where his teacher was Horatio Parker, a then famous American who was trained in the music of German Romanticism. As a college student, Ives wrote music played for the inauguration of President William McKinley.<br /><br />After graduation from Yale, Ives became a millionaire in the insurance industry where he pioneered many marketing techniques. He also became increasingly Progressive and politically active and actually proposed a constitutional amendment which would increase the power of the democracy in government decision-making. At the age of 32, he married Harmony Twitchell who, after his father, was the greatest influence on his life.<br /><br />Ives wrote music in the midst of an extraordinarily busy life. Most people think of Ives as a trailblazer and iconoclast. He was indeed, but may of his earlier works, such as the Second and the Third Symphonies are easily accessible and have a feel of America about them similar to the feelings Aaron Copland evoked some three decades later.<br /><br />Jan Swafford's biography movingly and eloquently describes the life of Charles Ives. He offers a reflective, thoughtful discussion of Ives, his America, his music, and its reception. In addition to a thorough treatment of Ives' life and works, Swafford has three chapters which he titles &#34;Entra'acets&#34; which consist of broad-based reflections on Ives's music and its significance. Swafford's entire book is full of ideas which are intriguing in themselves. Of Ives's work, Swafford gives his most extended treatment to the Fourth Symphony (he sees Ives as essentially a symphonist) and to the Concord piano Sonata. But many works are discussed in detail which will be accessible to the non-musician. The book has copious and highly substantive footnotes and an extensive bibliography.<br /><br />Ives's Americanness, humor, romanticism, modernism, optimism, and generosity ( Ives gave large amounts of money to his family and to musicians and music publications. He also paid for the publication of several of his important works when commercial publishers showed no interest in them.) come through well. Swafford sees Ives as the last American transcendentalist in the tradition of Emerson. At the conclusion of his book, Swafford writes of Ives (p. 434)<br /><br />&#34; [I]n his music and his life he embodied a genuine pluralism, a wholeness beneath diversity, that in itself is a beacon for democracy and its art. Aesthetically he is an alternative to Modernism, an exploratory road without the darkness and despair of the twentieth century. In spirit he handed us a baton and calls on us to carry it further. He suggests a way out of despair, but leaves it to us to find the route for ourselves. If we are alone with ourselves today, Ives speaks incomparably to that condition.&#34;<br /><br />This book made me want to learn more about and to hear the music of Charles Ives.

The broader aim, I think, is to reawaken an appreciation of the history of our country and to stimulate reflection on the American experience.  Thus, each volume tries to present a story of a life and also to explain briefly what is unique about each President and makes him worthy to be remembered.<br />Remini gives an excellent discussion of John Quincy Adams's service to the United States, both during his Presidency and before and after it.  The aspect of JQA's public service that stands out, both in his Presidency and outside it, is his commitment to  American Nationalism.  By this I mean a devotion to creating a strong, united nation for all the people to promote the public welfare. JQA worked diligently to advance the interests of the entire American people, as he saw these interests, rather than to be a tool of any faction or party or momentary passion.  Much of the time, he succeeded.<br />As President, JQA advocated the creation of public works and improvements to link the country together.  He was a strong supporter of education, scientific advancement, and learning.  He wanted the Federal government to play an active role in supporting these ends and worked towards the creation of an American university. (After his Presidency he was a strong advocate for the creation of the Smithsonian Institution.)<br /><br />Before he assumed the Presidency, Adams served as the Secretary of State under James Monroe. He worked for the goal of American Nationalism by expanding the boundaries of the United States through a skillful exercise of diplomacy until they extended to the Pacific Ocean.  JQA also was instrumental in the formulation of the Monroe Doctrine.<br />Following his presidency. JQA served as a Congressman from Massachusetts.  He distinguished himself in working for the anti-slavery cause and, specifically, by his tireless opposition to the \\"gag rule\\" which aimed to prevent critical discussion of slavery-related issues in the halls of Congress.<br />Remini presents his material in a way that focuses on this theme of JQA's public service and on its nationalistic aspirations .  He also points out how and why JQA failed to realize many of his goals, particularly during his term as the sixth President (1825-1828)  Adams was named President by the House of Representatives in a highly contested election.  It was alleged that he struck a \\"corrupt bargain\\" with Henry Clay, who became Adams's Secretary of State.  This \\"corrupt bargain\\" doomed the Adams Presidency and tarnished both Adams's and Clay's careers.<br />Adams was also highly opinionated and stuffy and gave the impression of aloofness.  He was not a good politician and lacked a certain ability to compromise or to work cooperatively with others.  At one point Remini writes (p. 110): \\"It is really impossible to think of any other president quite like John Quincy Adams.  He seemed intent on destroying himself and his administration. By the same token, it is difficult to think of a president with greater personal integrity.\\"  JQA was defeated for a second term by Andrew Jackson in a bitterly fought campaign.  Among other things, Jackson possessed abundant popular appeal and charisma, in sharp contrast to JQA's aloof, intellectual character.<br />While Adams's Presidency failed, his goals and ideals were good.  They lived on and deserve studying and remembering.<br />Remini also gives a good summary of Adams's personal life, adopting some of the psychohistory of JQa's recent biographers.  He points out the stresses that Adams endured from his famous father and mother and the pressures placed upon him and his brothers for high achievement.  JQA also imposed these pressures and expectations, alas, on his own children.  There is a good discussion of Adams's failed love affair as a young man --probably the one passion of his life -- and of his subsequent marriage to Louisa Johnson.  Remini describes JQAs extensive intellectual interests, his tendencies to anger and to depression and he links these traits in a sensible way to the failings of Adams's Presidency.<br />This is an excellent study of JQA which captures in short compass the essence and character of his contribution to the United States.  Readers who want to learn more about JQA -- with a focus on his service as Secretary of State and as Congressman from Massachusetts may wish to read the two-volume study by Samuel Flagg Bemis: \\"Joh Quincy Adams and the Foundations of American Foreign Policy\\" (1949) and \\"John Quincy Adams and the Union\\" (1956).re is a good discussion of Adams's failed love affair as a young man --probably the one passion of his life -- and of his subsequent marriage to Louisa Johnson.

The first volume covers the years 1941-1963 and takes the story up to the March on Washington in August, 1963. The second volume covers a shorter time span, 1963 - 1973, but an equally momentous series of events.  Volume II is easily important enough for its own short notice and review here.<br />The centerpiece of the two volumes is the March on Washington which celebrates its 40th anniversary this year.  Indeed, the 1963 March, led by Dr. King, may be the watershed event of the Civil Rights Movement as a whole.  There are three eyewitness accounts of the March presented in this book offering three different perspectives.  The 1963 March, and the moment of idealism, justice and peace it has come to represent pervades and suggests worlds of commentary upon the rest of the volume.<br />The articles in this book have an emphasis on Congressional action. In 1964, following the 1963 events in Birmingham Alabama and the 1963 March, Congress passed the Civil Rights Law which, in time, would effectively end segregation in the South.  In 1965, following events in Selma, Alabama and the March from Selma to Montgomery Alabama, Congress enacted voting rights legislation which at long last fulfilled the promise of the 15th Amendment to protect the voting rights of blacks.  The events in Selma, and the manner in which they galvanized the nation are well documented in this book.<br />The story recounted in this volume is marked by assasination, violence and discord. There are two major assassinations highlighted here. The volume describes Malcom X's break from the Black Muslim movement and his assassination in February, 1965.  A great deal of space is given to the assasination of Dr. Martin Luther King in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1965 and to its tragic aftermath.<br />There is much space given to the violence that haunted the struggle for Civil Rights.  In particular, many articles are given over to the murder of three young Civil Rights workers in Philadelphia, Mississippi: Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman, and James Cheney during June, 1964.  Their murder involved the FBI in a massive manhunt which ultimately led to the conviction of Klansmen and of local law enforcement officials.<br />There is a great deal of material in the volume on the riots in Watts and Detroit and with the rise of Black Power and the Black Panther movement.<br />There are articles in this volume that draw excellent portraits of the leaders of the Civil Rights movement, including Malcom X, Stokely Carmichael, Bayard Rustin, Ralph Abernathy, Jesse Jackson, and, of course, Dr. King.<br />There are pictures of dusty roads and small towns in the South.  Many articles are given to pictures of the South before and after the victories of the Civil Rights Movement.  There is a suggestion in more than a few articles that the South may have, given its past, an ultimately easier time of moving towards a unified, racially egalitarian and united society than will the North.  Time still needs to tell whether this is will in fact bethe case.<br />These are two indespensible volumes on the most important social movement of 20th Century America.

There are two related explanations for the title &quot;Diamond Sutra&quot;:  1. the teaching of the sutra cuts through diamonds or 2.  the sutra itself is the diamond that in its radiance and strength cuts through and illuminates everything. The text consists of 32 chapters (the chapter divisions are not in the original sources) and about 30 pages. The Diamond Sutra is one of the few texts of whatever type that will repay endless study and which can transform the life of the receptive reader.<br />Red Pine has produced a translation and commentary on the Diamond Sutra which help greatly in exploring it. The organization of the book bears discussing.  The book opens with a translation of the sutra, unadorned by commentary, which consists of about 30 pages.  The translation is followed by a Preface in which Red Pine gives some background on the text and on Buddhism, sketches out his interpretation of the text, and explains to the reader how he came to the Diamond Sutra over the years.<br />The longest section of the book consists of a commentary of about 400 pages arranged in 32 sections, one for each chapter of the Diamond Sutra.  Each section begins with the text of the Chapter followed by Red Pine's commentary on the chapter as a whole.  He then reproduces again a smaller portion of each chapter -- a paragraph, sentences, or sometimes only a phrase --and offers commentary on it.  The commentaries are sometimes Pine's own.  He also draws down a selection of the enormous commentary the Diamond Sutra has generated over the centuries. Some of this commentary dates from early Chinese sources and other portions of it are contemporary in origin. I found the various commentaries fascinating in themselves and useful in starting to approach the Diamond Sutra.<br />Pine also gives the reader familiar with the original sources an analysis of textual variations.  More importantly, he offers the general reader a glossary of the many names, places and sources to which his commentary refers, which are likely to be unfamiliar to those approaching the Diamond Sutra for the first time.<br />There is a great deal in the commentary, and in the Diamond Sutra itself, comparing the teaching of the Sutra, with its emphasis on the Bodisattva, who works with compassion for the salvation of all sentient beings, with the earlier, Theravada, school of Buddhism, with its emphasis on the Arahant and on individual enlightenment.  There is deep discussion in the Sutra on no-self, and on non-attachment. It is a text that will reward repeated meditation and readings.<br />Red Pine's book will help the reader begin with the Diamond Sutra and its difficult teachings.d Sutra.<br />Pine also gives the reader familiar with the original sources an analysis of textual variations.

Similarly, the most important and valuable social movement in our country in the Twentieth Century was the Civil Rights movement which began, essentially, in the 1940's with WW II, received its focus with the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, and continued through the 1950s 60s, and 70s.<br />The Library of America has published a two-volume history of the American Civil Rights Movement which focuses on contemporaneous journalistic accounts. The LOA's collection centers around the March on Washington in August 1963 which opens the second volume. The publication of the volumes, indeed, was timed to coincide with the 40th Anniversary of the March on Washington. This March is best known for Dr. Martin Luther King's \\"I have a Dream\\" speech.<br />The first volume of the series, which I am discussing here, begins in 1941 and ends in the middle of 1963. In consists of about 100 articles and essays documenting the Civil Rights struggle during these momentous years. Given the centrality of the March on Washington to the collection, the volume opens with a \\"Call to Negro America\\" dated July 1, 1941 calling for 10,000 Black Americans to march on Washington D.C. to secure integration and equal treatment in the Armed Forces. Philip Randolph, then the President of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters\\" was primarily responsible for this attempt to organize the 1941 march, and he participated prominently 22 years later in the 1963 March on Washington.<br />The volume documents other ways in which Civil Rights activities in the 1940s foreshadowed subsequent events. For example, there is an article detailing how Howard University students used the \\"sit-in\\" technique to desegregate Washington D.C. restaurants beginning in 1942. (see Pauli Murray's article on p. 62 of this volume). The sit-in technique was widely used beginning in the early 1960s to desegregate lunch counters in Southern and border states. There are many articles in this volume documenting these later sit-ins and their impact, as well as the original sit-in organized by Pauli Murray.<br />Among the many subjects covered by this book are Thurgood Marshall's early legal career for the NAACP, the Supreme Court's decision in \\"Brown\\", the lynching of Emmett Till in 1954 and the acquittal of the guilty parties by an all-white Mississippi jury, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, in which Martin Luther King first gained prominence, of 1956, the integration of Little Rock High School in 1957, the lunch counter sit-ins that I have already mentioned, the \\"Freedom Rides\\" the admission of James Meridith to the University of Mississippi in 1962, the Birmingam riots, and the murder of Medgar Evars, Missippi Field Secretary for the NAACP. on June 12, 1962. There is a great deal more, and the articles given in the volume address Civil Rights in the North as well as in the South.<br />There is an immediacy and an eloquence to this collection that gives the reader the feel of being there and participating at the time. The cumulative effect of reading the book through is moving and powerful. By reading the book cover-to-cover and as the articles are presented the reader will get a better feel for the Civil Rights Movement and Era that can be gotten anywhere else. The book records a seminal Era in our Nation's history and an idealism and a sprit that is difficult to recreate or recapture.<br />I would like to point out some of the longer articles that the reader should notice in going through the book. I enjoyed James Poling's 1952 essay \\"Thurgood Marshall and the 14th Amendment\\" which chronicles Marshall's early career. Another important essay is William Bradford Huie's \\"Emmett Till's Killers Tell their Story: January, 1956.\\" which recounts the confession to Till's murder of the individuals acquitted by the Mississippi jury. Robert Penn Warren's 1956book-length essay \\"Segregation: the Inner Conflict in the South\\" is reprinted in the volume in full. There is a lengthy excerpt from James Baldwin's 1962 \\"The Fire Next Time\\" which recounts Baldwin's meeting with Elijah Muhammad and his thoughts about the Black Muslim Movement. Norman Podhoretz's 1963 essay \\"My Negro Problem and Ours\\" remains well worth reading. Probably the most significant single text in this volume is Martin Luther King's \\"Letter from the Birmingham Jail\\" written in 1963. In this famous letter, Dr. King responds eloquently to criticism of his movement and his techniques voiced by eight Birmingham clergymen. The letter is a classic, not the least for Dr. King's writing style.<br />The book contains a chronology which will help the reader place the articles in perspective, and biographical notes on each of the authors. I found myself turning to the biographies and the chronology repeatedly as I read the volume. The Library of America has also posted excellent study material for this book and its companion volume on its Website.<br />This is a book that documents American's history and our country's continuing struggle to meet and develop its ideals.book-length essay \\"Segregation: the Inner Conflict in the South\\" is reprinted in the volume in full.

It is the third of Updike's novels I have read, spaced widely over the years, with the other two being \\"Roger's Version\\", which predated this book, and \\"In the Beauty of the Lillies\\", which followed it. I had similar reactions to all three books. Updike deals with important and large themes, such as the possiblity and nature of a belief in God in a skeptical age, the character and promise of American life and history, and, of course, the nature of human sexuality.<br />There are interesting things in the books by Updike that I have read. But they are all highly uneven with long, dull and wordy  sections. Worse,the books have each seemed to me glib in a way that detracts from the importance of their themes. They are more in the nature of literary performances than thoughtful explorations of their subject matters. I have thought about the three Updike books I have read, and was engaged while I was reading them. But I still came away dissatisfied.<br />\\"Memories of the Ford Administration\\" begins when, in 1992, a historical organization called the Northern New England Association of American Historians asks Professor Alfred Clayton (named after Alf Landon, the 1936 Republican Presidential candidate) to provide \\"requested memories and impressions of he presidential Administration of Gerald R. Ford (1974-1977).\\" Clayton is a professor at a small women's 2-year college in New Hampshire during the Ford years. By 1992, the college is a four-year institution and has gone co-ed.<br />In response to the request Clayton produces instead a long, rambling, draft-like monologue which is the text of this novel. It consists, in roughly alternating sections, of a discussion of Clayton's personal life during the Ford years, and of a long unfinished manuscript of Clayton's involving the life and administration of President James Buchanan. Buchanan was the fifteenth President, just before Lincoln, and the only bachelor President.<br />One can understand the befuddlement and the irritation with which the Northern New England Association of American Historians would have greeted Clayton's response. The trouble is, as far as the novel is concerned, that their response is justified and that the reader of the novel is entitled to the same response and more. There are interesting things in Clayton's ruminations on his life and good discussions in the manuscript on Buchanan. There is little on President Ford's administration and, from a novelistic standpoint, far too little in tying the Ford administration together in some insightful way with Clayton's life or with the Buchanan administration. Updike tries to do this I think, but in an overly clever manner. That is why the book is more a \\"performance\\" than it should be and ultimately doesn't succeed.<br />Clayton remembers the Ford years as a time of widespread sexual openness and promiscuity. The novel focuses on his sexual liasions and primarily on his lengthy audulterous affair with a woman named Genevieve, the wife of a colleague at the University, whom he fantasizes to be the \\"ideal wife.\\" Genevieve and Clayton abandon their families, including young children, to pursue their affair, with deleterious and unhappy consequences. Neither has the will to get a divorce and to marry the other.<br />Twentieth century writers of every variety show great interest in sex and in the human libido. I think it is a product of the englightment, with the attendant skepticism toward revealed religion, that took place centuries ago, not, of course, in the Ford Administration. Even writers and individuals who have remained committed to organized religion have tended, for the most part, to accept at least some of this product of enlightenment thought. I found it useful to remember this in considering the book's treatment of sexuality.<br />The Buchanan portion of the book focuses on Buchanan's romance with a young woman during his early career as a lawyer, the termination of the romance due to what appears to be a misunderstanding, and the subsequent early death of Buchanan's beloved. There are good scenes in the book describing Buchanan's subsequent relationships with President Andrew Jackson and the novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne. The final days of Buchanan's administration, the prologue to our Civil War, are described in a revealing, if slapdash, way.<br />There is a focus on the elusive character of historical understanding -- which is good and well-taken. The book seems to suggest the impossiblilty of achieving anything even approximating historical truth which seems to me tendentious and unsupported.<br />One theme that comes through, I think, is the value of restraint of our tendencies to be overly-critical of our national leaders, of American culture, and of ourselves. This is easier to do when events are separated from us by historical time, as is the case with President Buchanan, than is the case with our contemporaries, such as President Ford. There is also the broad theme of forgiveness running through the book.  I found President Ford's pardon of former President Nixon hovering in the backround of this novel, even though it is little discussed. Thus, to the extent the book deals with the Ford Administration at all, what it has to say is thoughtful and humane. President Ford is praised for doing his best, for keeping the Nation's interests at heart, and for acting in a responsible manner. (see, e.g. p.354, p.366) Professor Clayton learns, I think, in the course of his ruminations, to work towards a sense of forgiveness and understanding of his own life, including its disappointments and failings. I think this too is a message of the book, but I find it obscured by a good deal of false bravado, obscurity, and unnecessarily showy writing.<br />There is good material in this book and it stimulates reflection. Thus I think the book will reward reading in spite of the reservations about its specific tone, style, and substance that I have expressed.young woman during his early career as a lawyer, the termination of the romance due to what appears to be a misunderstanding, and the subsequent early death of Buchanan's beloved.

US	48185764	R1W6X6CBMJQ1IB	0199254567	36136688	Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650-1750	Books	5	73	77	N	N	Spinoza, Enlightenment, and the Love of Learning	Jonathan Israel has written an erudite, extensive, and inspiring study on a seminal moment in Western thought, commonly known as the Age of Enlightenment.In short, the Enlightenment marks a change from a thought and society that was theologically focused to thought and society that were secular and scientific in character.  This period and this transition has been much studied, but Israel has many new insights to offer. In addition, he writes a book filled with wonderful detail, with rare thinkers and books that make the reader yearn to learn more.  It is an enlightening experience in itself to read this book.<br />The book begins with the philosophy of Descartes which is widely regarded as overthrowing the philosophy of scholasticism and initiating the modern period.  Descartes developed a dualism with a mechanistic philosophy of nature and a spiritual philosophy of mind.  It was the first of many attempts to reconcile theology with the newly developed scientific outlook.<br />But the focus of Professor Israel's study is on Spinoza (1632-1677.)  Spinoza rejected Cartesian dualism and developed his philosophy equating God and Nature.  He rejected a transcendental God, providence, miracles, revelation, and transcendental bases for human ethics. Spinoza developed his ideas in his Ethics while in his earlier and almost equally important Theological-Political Treatise, Spinoza developed the basis for modern Bible criticism.<br />Professor Israel argues that Spinoza's thought constitutes the basis for what he terms \\"radical enlightmentment\\", which rejected theology and revealed religion in favor of a philosophy of mechanism and determinism.  Radical enlightenment proved to be a potent weapon in rejecting the divine right of kings and other forms of privilege, in promoting democracy and the rights of women, in encouraging free speech and free thought, and in allowing people to pursue happiness, in particular sexual fulfillment, in this world without fear of hells and punishments in the next world. Spinoza influenced many scholars and thinkers and also, Israel points out, had substantial influence on unlettered people of his time.<br />Professor Israel contrasts the Radical Enlightenment emanating from Spinoza with \\"moderate enlightenment\\".  Moderate enlightenment sought, as I indicated above, to reconcile mechanism and science with traditional religious faith, to the extent possible.  Professor Israel identifies three separate strains of moderate enlightenment:  Cartesianism, the monadic philosophy of Leibniz and Wolff, and the deism and empiricism of Locke and Newton.  Most of the book is about Radical Enlightenment and its impact and about the interplay between Radical Enlightenment on the one hand and Moderate Enlightenment and traditionalism on the other hand.<br />The book includes a good basic exposition of the thought of Spinoza. (The exposition of Descartes thought and of the teachings of scholasticism is less thorough.) The major theme of the book is that Spinoza's ideas were not simply those of an isolated recluse; rather, his ideas became widely known and disseminated even during his lifetime, and became the basis for much of the secular, modern thought and life we have today.<br />Israel discusses a plethora of sources, some well-known some highly obscure in which various thinkers from throughout Europe (another theme of Israel's book is that Enlightenment was European in character and shared essentially the same features in all European countries) adopted and promulgated Spinozistic doctrines.  The books and individuals are fascinating, as are the conflicts many of them encountered with civil and religous authorities.  He discusses how many writers had to try to present their teachings covertly (i.e. by appearing to criticize Spinozism while in fact advocating it.) in order to attempt to avoid conflict.  There are also extended treatments of Leibniz and Locke and their interactions with Radical Enlightenment.<br />For the most part, Professor Israel avoids explicit comment on the philosophical merits of the many ideas and thinkers he explores.  The reader is left to think through the issues on the basis of his descriptions and from the words of the thinkers themselves.  It is a fascinating study.<br />I have long been a student of Spinoza and came away from this book awed by the wealth of learning displayed in this book and by the scope and influence of Radical Enlightenment in the years following Spinoza's death.  Philosophically, I came away from this book with a new appreciation of the virtues of Western secularism and with a renewed understanding of the dear price that has been paid for the intellectual liberation of the mind and heart.  It is a journey that every person must undertake for him or herself, and many people may reach results that differ from those reached during the age of Radical Enlightenment.  Spinoza's goal (shared with the religious thinkers whom he rejected) was to find the path to human blessedness, enlightenment, and happiness by freeing the mind.  I got a good sense of the value of this search through reading this masterful book.he most part, Professor Israel avoids explicit comment on the philosophical merits of the many ideas and thinkers he explores.

The books in the series can be read quickly, and each gives the reader an overview of the life and accomplishments of an important American figure.  It is a worthy goal to encourage people to get a working understanding of our presidents and part of an attempt to reeducate Americans about their country and government. The series, Schelsinger states in his introductory note, will &quot;give readers some understanding of the pitfalls and potentialities of the presidency and also of the responsiblities of citizenship&quot;.<br />Professor Graff's short study of the life of Grover Cleveland (1837-1908) fulfills the aim of the series.  The book consists of a brief biography of Cleveland and covers his youth, his public (and some of his private) life before he became president, his two presidencies, and his life in retirement. The accomplishments of each of his two terms are summarized, if  briefly.<br />As do most writers who have studied Cleveland, Professor Graff finds his strength in his integrity and common sense. He was able to persuade his fellow Americans, both before and during his presidency of his honesty. Cleveland was a President without charisma and an uninspiring public speaker.  He regretted his entire life his lack of a college education, and his career shows something of a discomfort with new ideas or new approaches.  Yet, he was able to turn these traits, together with his own strengths into advantages.  He proved a capable and inspiring President.<br />Professor Graff does not engage in hero-worship.  If anything, I thought that he somewhat undervalued Cleveland and his accomplishment.  He describes some aspects of Cleveland's presidencies which seem to run counter to the picture of Cleveland as a reformer and as given to complete probity and openness.(For examples, Graff discusses the abrupt dismissals of many Republican civil servants at the outset of his terms and the secret operation on Cleveland's jaw which was held on a ship offshore to conceal it from the public at the beginning of Cleveland's second term.)  Yet Graff finds much to admire in Cleveland in his hard work, acknolwedgement of his illegitimate child, financial probity, and Civil Service reform.  Graff praises Cleveland for his refusal to support the annexation of Hawaii when its queen was overthrown under dubious circumstances.  Cleveland restored public faith in government at a time when it was sorely lacking.  I think he was the first President who could be desribed as attempting to govern by principles that he believed were both &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;compassionate.&quot;  In this he is an inspiration whose goals, if not all his specific decisions, could be followed and expanded upon.<br />This is not a complete study of Grover Cleveland but it succeeds well in giving the reader a sense of his accomplishment. The reader who wants to learn more might read Allan Nevins', &quot;Grover Cleveland, A Study in Courage&quot; (1944) which remains the standard biography of Cleveland.examples, Graff discusses the abrupt dismissals of many Republican civil servants at the outset of his terms and the secret operation on Cleveland's jaw which was held on a ship offshore to conceal it from the public at the beginning of Cleveland's second term.)

It has been viewed, both by those within and without it, as a distinctive region of the United States with its own character and identity. This separateness is the source of much of the fascination with the South. But in addition to its distinct character, the South has also been viewed as internally monolithic. As David Goldfield, Professor of History at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, states in the introduction to this book: [Southern] culture is rich in music, food, conversation, and literature; yet, it can be a barren place, a tundra of conformity, a murderer of imagination, inquiry, and innovation.&#34; (p.1)<br /><br />Professor Goldfield states that the aim of his book, &#34;Still Fighting the Civil War&#34;, is not simply to write a history of what the South is and of how it is different. Rather the book attempts to explore why Southerners have understood their history the way they do. Thus the goal of the book is to achieve some self-understanding of the South by people who consider themselves Southerners and to achieve better understanding of what has made the South what it is by those not Southerners. Equally important, Professor Goldfield suggests approaches for a more inclusive way in which the South might use its history to emphasize the common past shared by all Southerners, white and black, and the contributions that both races have made to the development of the South. Attempts at self-understanding, of persons or regions, are notoriously difficult. Professor Goldfield commendably admits that although he has spent much more than half his life in the South, &#34;I do not pretend to understand it yet. Perhaps I never will.&#34; (p. 1)<br /><br />Professor Goldfield emphasizes the manner in which white Southerners have viewed the Civil War and Reconstruction. With the total military defeat, loss of life and property, and destruction of slavery, Southerners created a vision of the War and their society to save themselves. This vision included a romanticizing of the Old South, (exemplified in, &#34;Birth of a Nation&#34;, &#34;Gone with the Wind&#34; and many other sources), a myth of the &#34;Lost Cause&#34; with glorification of leaders such as Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson and Jefferson Davis, and a story of &#34;the Redeemers&#34; who ended the Reconstruction efforts in the South through intimidation and violence and instituted segregation and white supremacy. (For a current example of the glorification of the Southern War effort and its generals, I suggest a viewing of the newly-released movie, &#34;Gods and Generals.&#34;)<br /><br />Professor Goldfield discusses how and why the South used its myth of its past in the development of its evangelical religion and its implementation of Jim Crow. He devotes a great deal of space to the place of gender in the South. Professor Goldfield points out that white male Southerners tried to justify Jim Crow by the alleged need to protect white women from the sexuality of black men, but he goes further than that. He states that white men attempted to put white women on a pedestal following the Civil War, and he attributes a great deal of gender discrimination to this attempt. I am not convinced by all this and I am not sure that Professor Goldfield shows how women's issues differed in the South from those in the North. Certainly, the relationship between women and men has changed markedly in both regions.<br /><br />Professor Goldfield talks about the changes wrought in the South by the Civil Rights movement culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1965. He applauds the changes and the fall of segregation, but he offers strong reasons to doubt if the change is as extensive as it seems. He believes that black and white people still live essentially separate lives in the South with too little in the way of intimacy and fellowship between people of the different races. He believes that there is a great deal of racism left in the South under the veneer of desegregation.<br /><br />The book is at its strongest and most eloquent when it points to the common heritage that both black and white Southerners share. Blacks in the region consider themselves as Southerners no less than do the whites, and the Region shares a common culture in music (blues, jazz, early rock, country), literature, food, religion, and in the pace of life. In addition Professor Goldfield writes that that the division of the races under Jim Crow belied the affection between individuals of different races that was a frequent pattern of life in the South.<br /><br />Professor Goldfield concludes that the South is inescapably a product of its history. He suggests a modification of this history in the minds of Southerners and others to eliminate the myths, to accept and understand the end of the Civil War and of racism, and to focus on the many valuable things that white Southerners and black Southerners, separately and in common, have done to make the South what it is and to allow it to move forward. This is a worthy goal. Professor Goldfield's book may be a small step in bringing it about.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanm left in the South under the veneer of desegregation.<br /><br />The book is at its strongest and most eloquent when it points to the common heritage that both black and white Southerners share.

He suggests a modification of this history in the minds of Southerners and others to eliminate the myths, to accept and understand the end of the Civil War and of racism, and to focus on the many valuable things that white Southerners and black Southerners, separately and in common, have done to make the South what it is and to allow it to move forward. This is a worthy goal. Professor Goldfield's book may be a small step in bringing it about.<br /><br />Robin Friedman	2003-03-01

The first volume included five novels of Dawn Powell written between 1930 and 1942.  This, the second, volume includes four of Powell's novels written between 1944 and 1965.<br /><br />Powell's earlier novels generally are set in small-town Ohio in the early 20th Century.  They have as themes what Powell saw as the conformity and frustration, sexual and otherwise, of small-town life.  The main characters in these books, typically young people, long to escape to make a new life for themselves in the city.  The latter novels are, for the most part, set in New York City where Powell lived most of her adult life.  The novels are comic and satirical, sometimes sharply so.  They reflect loss of innocence and love and, on occasion, fall into cynicism.<br /><br />The first volume of the Library of America compilation included two early Ohio novels,  &#34;Dance Night' and &#34;Come Back to Sorrento&#34; and three novels reflecting Powell's change in style and theme and set in New York City, &#34;Turn, Magic Wheel', &#34;Angels on Toast&#34;, and &#34;A Time to be Born.&#34; The second volume opens with a novel in which Dawn Powell returned to the setting of small-town Ohio.  The book, &#34;My Home is Far Away&#34; (1944), is a fictionalized account of Powell's early unhappy childhood.  The book offers a poignant picture of the death of Powell's mother and of her father's remarriage to a cruel and jealous stepmother. There are excellent scenes of the family wandering through cramped Ohio towns and small dusty hotels and back neighborhoods. The father himself is portrayed as a travelling salesman who generally behaves carelessly and irresponsibly to his three daughters. Powell initially planned this book as the first of a trilogy.  This project did not materialize.<br /><br />In the next book in the collection, &#34;The Locusts have no King&#34;(1948),  Powell returned to sharp satire and to New York City.  The book is set after the conclusion of WW II and includes a memorable passage of reflection at the end on the United States atomic testing program at Bikini Atoll.  The book contrasts the life of serious, scholarly writing and its difficulty with the life of superficial magazine publishing devoted to economic success and to popular culture.  There is also a love story, serious to the participants, in which the main character of the book, a serious if unsuccessful scholar, becomes infatuated with a shallow, sexy blonde.  This book reminded me of George Gissing's Victorian novel of the literary life, &#34;New Grub Street&#34; as well as of West's &#34;Day of the Locust&#34;, which has some of the same themes and the same dark humor as does Powell's book.<br /><br />Powell wrote &#34;The Wicked Pavilion&#34; in 1954.  Unlike most of Powell's works, the book appeared on the best-seller lists for a very brief time.  The book is set in New York City in the late 1940s and celebrates, if that is the word, a bar called &#34;The Cafe Julien&#34;, located in Greenwich Village,  and its patrons. The book is full of would-be artists without talent, unhappy lovers, and people on the lookout for the main chance.  It is sharp, astringent satire very close to disillusion.  The book is well and convincingly written.<br /><br />Powell's final novel, and the last in this collection, &#34;The Golden Spur&#34; (1962) was nominated for the National Book Award.  As does its predecessor, this novel centers around a drinking establishment which gives the book its title and its patrons.  This book also is set in Greenwich Village in the 1950's and records novelistically the passing of an era.  This novel, as are some of Powell's earlier works, is a coming-of-age story which tells the story of a young man who comes to New York City from Ohio to learn the identity of his father.  In the process, the young man learns about himself as well.  This book is impressive less for its story line than for the beautiful writing style Powell achieved in this, her last novel.  The book is deliberately light in tone, and I think it ranks with Powell's best.<br /><br />Dawn Powell produced a substantial body of excellent work describing the places and lives (primarily her own) with which she was familiar.  The qualities of growing up, coming-of age, searching and frustration, and the loss of innocence are all well portrayed.  The descriptions of New York City, in particular, are themselves irreplaceable.  Those readers who enjoy the pleasure of discovering a previously little-known writer will enjoy the novels of Dawn Powell.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanas well.

In general, Powell wrote the New York City novels, such as &#34;Turn Magic Wheel&#34;, and &#34;The Locusts Have no King&#34; later in her career. They tend to be sharp satires. Her earlier Ohio novels, such as &#34;Dance Night&#34; and &#34;Come Back to Sorrento&#34;, are marked, I think, by a depiction of small town life which is critical and bittersweet, as well as somewhat satirical, and by a restlessness and sense of frustration, ...<br /><br />Powell worked for three years on &#34;My Home is Far Away&#34; which was published in 1944. She had difficulty with the book, writing and rewriting the various scenes as she tried to fictionalize her biography and turn it into a novel. The book appears in the midst of her New York novels, and it is a throwback in to her earlier books with its setting in Ohio, its focus on childhood, and its bittersweet tone. Powell intended this novel as the first of a three-part trilogy, but the other two volumes never materialized.<br /><br />Most of Powell's novels seem to me distinctly autobiographical in tone and &#34;My Home is Far away&#34; is particularly so. It tells the story of a family, focusing on three young sisters, Lena, Marcia, and Florrie, their father Harry, their mother Daisy, and, after Daisy's death, their stepmother Idah. There are basically three parts to the story: the period leading to the death of Daisy, and intervening period in which the three girls are raised by their father and assorted other relatives, and a the period after their father remarries and the girls are subjected to a cruel stepmother. When they find they can no longer take the abuse, they leave home and come into their own lives.<br /><br />The title of the novel, &#34;My Home is Far Away&#34; derives from an Irish song that the girls sing with their mother. The title well captures some of the rootlessness of the family as they move from here to there. It also evokes well the longing for a home life and for a stability which the family, and Dawn Powell, never had.<br /><br />One of the problems with this book is differentiating the characters of three young girls. On the whole, this is handled effectively. The Dawn Powell character is the middle sister, Marcia, who is plain but highly precocious. The older girl, Lena, is much more sociable and outgoing.<br /><br />The family moved a great deal from one small Ohio town to another and to different places within various towns. The most effective scenes in the book for me were the pictures of many dingy, run-down hotels and small town back streets during which the girls spent much of their childhood. The father, Harry, was a traveling salesman who, for most of the book, has difficulty holding a job and spending time with his family. He professes to love his family, but doesn't provide well. He spends his time and money hanging around with his friends and, apparently, with women in various towns.<br /><br />One key moment in the book occurs rather early in it when the girls' mother dies. This scene is beautifully told. Then we see Harry trying to shunt the girls off to various relatives until he finally attempts to care for them himself. The marriage to Idah brings Harry some stability, but at a terrible cost. Idah is a shrewish, jealous stepmother. The two older girls both leave home to get away from her.<br /><br />This book has some slow moments, but it is a wonderful coming-of-age novel and gives a good picture of the rural Midwest. It is good that Dawn Powell's novels are in print and readily accessible. It is intriguing to think how she might have proceeded in the remaining two projected volumes of her autobiographical trilogy.<br /><br />Robin Friedmansome of the rootlessness of the family as they move from here to there.

De Milja is a man of few words, perceptive, hard, unafraid of danger, and able to adjust to new situations. He also has no difficulty in attracting women and has several lovers, of varying duration, to accompany him through his adventures.  His wife, to whom he is devoted, dies midway through the book.<br />This novel tells the stories of de Milja's experiences as a spy in Warsaw, Paris and the Ukraine.  It is episodic in character with each unit of the story essentially self-contained.  The writing is fast-paced and hard-boiled as befitting a spy story.  There were times when I thought the story flagged and lost my interest.<br />Alan Furst knows has subject matter and depicts well the fall of Warsaw and Paris and the activities of the Partisans in the Ukraine.  The Nazi's failed invasions of Britain and the U.S.S.R. form the backdrop of the book and they are well-conveyed.  I found the middle sections of the book the most interesting with good depictions of people and places, particularly low life in Paris.<br />The book is good to read because of the perspective it brings to WW II which is both unusual and realistic.  The book is somewhat more than a spy novel due to Furst's attempt to develop and show growth in the character of his hero.  This development occurs in the final section of the book which explores the confusing world of conflicting partisan resistance movements in the Ukraine.  Oddly enough, the plotting and spying in this section are, to me, the weakest in the book.<br />De Milja changes in this way. In the prior sections of the story, Furst establishes him as a lover and a ladies man.  There are occasions when De Milja takes a mistress in part to save his cover and many other occasions where he takes a lover only because he wants to do so.  The connection between spying and amorous activities is an established one.  There are tensions and risks in this line of work, and surely a feeling that one must enjoy what one can.<br />In the final chapter of the book, de Milja meets a young woman refuge named Sasha.  She is not particularly beautiful or talented, but she is fleeing for her life, she is vulnerable, and she is available.  De Milja saves her life, through great peril.  Sasha lets it be known that she would be willing to, perhaps even interested in, sex with De Milja as they weave their way through danger.<br />Furst makes a great deal of de Milja not availaing himself of this opportunity. (Even though de Milja and Sasha need to bundle together in a car to keep warm at night.)  I think this shows a development in de Milja's character from the rather free-wheeling womanizer he is in the earlier sections of the book.  It also shows that he has developed some sense of looking at his female companion as an individual rather than as a pawn in a global game of war.  I think we are meant to see de Milja as developing a quality of compassion in this portion of the story and a sense of connectedness to another person.  He is willing to forgo sex, even when it is offered, welcome, and not even illicit in order to bring Sasha and himself to safety.  It is buried in lots of war detail and not really prepared for during the body of the novel, but Furst shows development in the character of his hero.<br />This is why the book is slightly more than a spy story.tween spying and amorous activities is an established one.

The Dalai Lama used the change to the new Millenium as a call to ethical and spiritual reflection and to an awakening to a new, informed inner life.<br />The book is eloquent and compelling.  The Dalai Lama's command of English is somewhat limited, and the text undoubtedly was subject to substantial editing.  But the sincerity and power of the book shines through, as does the Dalai Lama's modesty.  It is something of a rarity for a book to sound the call to spiritual renewal while refusing to proselytize or to promote a specific creed.<br />The Dalai Lama promises repeatedly that his book is concerned with ethics and spirituality rather than with Buddhist tenents.  There is nothing in this book, for example, that even suggests the reader take up a meditiation practice.  Although there is a substantial treatment of the difficult Buddhist teaching of Dependent Origination, the Dalai Lama makes good on his word.  The book can be read and appreciated by people who are secular -- without a religious faith -- and by those who are committed to a faith tradition other than Buddhism.<br />The Dalai Lama's basic message here, I think, is that all people strive to be happy.  In the West, we tend to equate the pursuit of happiness with materialistic success.  This goes part of the way to happiness but has difficulties in terms of the anxiety, competitiveness, and insenitiveness to ourselves and others that it creates.  The Dalai Lama's answer, in common with much religious and spiritual writing, is to look inward.  What is important is how the Dalai Lama elaborates his teaching in this book.<br />The Dalai Lama insists that spiritual renewal requires a commitment to ethical behavior.  There are two levels to this.  The first, more basic level, is to act in a way that doesn't bring harm.  This is a seemingly simple teaching, but one difficult to put in practice in specific situations.  The second level is to aim to be other-directed rather than self-directed in one's actions.  This means acting with patience, generosity, compassion, nonviolence, empathy, thought for the other person, rather than for oneself.  For the Dalai Lama this second level underlies all spirituality and religious traditions and is more fundamental than any metaphysical or faith issues.  People can disagree on the latter or not hold any religious position at all.<br />After developing the foundations of what he sees as ethical and spiritual behavior, the Dalai Lama offers suggestions for the individual's redirection of him or herself in terms of restraint, virtue, compassion, and the relief of suffering.  Again, I was struck by the modesty of the teaching and by the Dalai Lama's claim that spiritual redirection can be independent of the individual's commitment or lack of commitment to a religous creed.  The Dalai Lama emphasizes at one point that &quot;we are not talking about Buddahood here&quot; but rather about how any individual can aim for ethical and spiritual redirection.<br />A chapter in the final section of the book discusses &quot;the role of religion in modern society.&quot;  The Dalai Lama explains his own commitment to Tibetan Buddhism but insists again that such commitment is unnecessary for the individual to redirect energy to the ethical/spiritual life. In fact, in this book the Dalai Lama discourages religious conversion but urges the reader to remain in his or her own faith and work within it.  He maintains that all religions teach the same basic ethical and spiritual precepts while their metaphysical or faith commitments differ.  He offers a plea that people from different faith traditions learn that they can learn much from each other while maintaining their own belief system. He reiterates that people shouldn't force themselves to have a religion at all if they are committed to a secular worldview.<br />There is a great deal of wisdom and simplicity in this book.It may be valuable to those who want to consider redirecting or better understanding themselves.It may be valuable to those who want to consider redirecting or better understanding themselves.	2003-02-19
US	48185764	RI7OAL7ZWP2A4	1931082014	103678861	Dawn Powell: Novels 1930-1942 (Library of America)	Books	5	17	18	N	N	An American Novelist Attains Stature	Dawn Powell (1896-1965) wrote 15 novels which received little notice during her lifetime. Powell was born in rural Ohio. After college, she moved to Grenwich Village in New York City where she lived most of her life. Her novels have a strong element of autobiography. She wrote novels of her early experience in Ohio and novels of her life in New York City and often contrasted the different pacings and values of life in the Midwest and in New York.  Her later books are sharply satirical and often cynical.  She wrote of love and of affairs and of loss in unconventional situations.<br />In the 1990s, many people discovered Powell's works, sparked largely by the biography and other writings on Powell by Tim Page.  In 2001, the Library of America published a two volumes of Dawn Powell, with notes by Tim Page, including 9 of her novels.  The LOA is a wonderful and ambitious project which aims to capture the best in American writing, novels, poetry, history, philosophy.  It is a record of American thought and of the American experience.<br />This volume consists of five novels that Powell wrote between 1930 and 1952.  The first two books center upon life in the Midwest while the latter three books are satires of urban life.<br />The first novel in the book, Dance Night (1930), was Powell's fourth published novel and her own favorite of her works.  It is a coming-of-age novel set in a town called Lamptown, Ohio.  It deals with the restlessness of adolescence in a small town and with sexual frustration. The book points the way for its hero to leave Lamptown on a train bound, presumably, to seek his chance in New York City.<br />\\"Come Back to Sorrento\\", Powell's next novel was written in 1932 and sold very poorly.  But the novel is a gem.  It is set in a small midwestern town and its two main characters are a woman, trapped in an unhappy marriage who had dreamed in her youth of becoming a singer, and the town music teacher who had aspired to become a concert pianist and who is likely homosexual. The book is on the whole subdued and understated and centers upon the frustrating relationship between the two protagonists.<br />The next book in the collection, \\"Turn, Magic Wheel\\" (1936), is the first of Powell's novels satirizing life in New York City.  Its characters are a young man who has published one successful novel lampooning a literary idol of the day, the literary idol himself, (modelled on Earnest Hemingway), and the women who are involved with both of them.  There are great descriptions of the streets, bars and sites of New York City.  The story is sharply, but compassionately, told.  The book, I think, is ultimately a love story with an ambiguous message about the possiblity of happiness.<br />\\"Angels on Toast\\" (1940) is a satire of the world of business with its two main characters commuting by train from Chicago to New York City in search of money and mistresses.  It is sharp and engaging, if one-dimensional.  I don't think it as good as the other four novels in this volume.<br />The final work in this collection, \\"A Time to be Born\\" (1942) was one of Powell's few novels to achieve commercial success during her lifetime.  One of the main characters in this book is modelled in part on Clare Boothe Luce.  In this book, Powell juxtaposes life in midwest Ohio with life in New York City.  The two major women characters in the book move to New York from the same small town in Ohio with very different results. This book is satirical but it is also -- actually primarily -- a coming-of-age novel for its young woman heroine.  It gives an unforgettable picture of life in New York City just at the eve of United States entry into WW II.<br />Powell is best known as a satirist, but the books in this series show she was that and more.  Her themes as a novelist are somewhat limited, but they are developed well and embroidered in each successive work.  Her writing style develops with time until in her final novels (the second volume of the series) it becomes beautiful.  She offers a vision of New York City and of the loss of innocence that is her own. The Library of America series is to be commended for finding writers describing American experience in somewhat unexpected places.  Powell deserves her place in this series and in American literature.  This volume will give the reader a good exposure to the work of Dawn Powell.es) it becomes beautiful.

He translates Marcus's reflections into a colloquial, frequently earthy, English in unstitled language and idiom that will be familiar to a modern reader.  I think the translation is as well faithful to Marcus's thought.  The reflective, meditative character of the paragraphs come through well, as does the difficulty of the text in many places.  This is a book that will encourage the modern reader to approach Marcus -- an altogether commendable result.<br />Professor Hays has written an excellent introduction to his translation which can be read with benefit by those coming to the &quot;Meditations&quot; for the first time and by those familiar with the work.  There is a brief discussion of Marcus's life, his philosophical studies, and his tenure as emperor of Rome (161-180 A.D.) Hays spends more time on the philosophical background of Marcus's thought emphasizing ancient stoicism and of the philosophy of Heraclitus. He discusses the concept of &quot;logos&quot;, a critical term for Marcus and for later thought, and argues that logos -- or the common reason that pervades man and the universe -- is as much a process as it is a substance.  This is difficult, but insightful.<br />Hays obviously has a great love for Marcus's book and has thought about it well. He is able to offer critical observations which will help the reader focus in studying the Meditations.  (For example, Hays argues that Marcus does not understand or appreciate human joy very well.  He also argues that Marcus's thought takes an overly static view of the nature of society and does not see the possiblity or need for societal change.) Hays discusses briefly the reception of the Meditiations over the centuries.  I enjoyed in particular his references to the essays of Arnold and Brodsky on Marcus Aurelius.  I haven't read these essays, but Hays's discussion makes me want to do so.<br />The Meditations is one of the great book of the West and will repay repeated readings.  When I read it this time, I was struck by Marcus's devotion to his duties in life as the Roman emperor.  I got the distinct impression that Marcus would have rather been at his studies but kept telling himself, in his writings, that he had to persevere and be the person he was meant to be.  It is a focused approach, to say the least, to the duties to which one was called.<br />I was also impressed with the similarities at certain points between Marcus's thought and Buddhism.  Other reviewers have also noted this similarity.  Marcus talks repeatedly about the changing, impermanent character of human life and about the pervasive character of human suffering.  He talks about controlling and ending suffering by understanding its causes and then changing one's life accordingly. There is a need to learn patience and to control anger and desire.  More specifically, Marcus' understanding of perception and how it leads to desire and can be controlled by reason (discussed well in Hays's introduction.) is very Buddhist in tone.  I have become interested in Buddhism and was struck in this reading of the Meditations by the parallels it offers to Buddhist thought.<br />There is a wonderful paragraph in the Meditations where Marcus urges himself to persevere and not to lose hope simply because he did not become a scholar or a hero or the person of his dreams.  What matters is being a good person and living in harmony with one's nature.  This passage spoke clearly and poignantly to me as I reread the Meditations.  Undoubtedly, the reader will find passages in this book that are addressed clearly to him orher.<br />This is a book that should be read and pondered many times.  Hays and the Modern Library have done readers a service with this translation.or her.<br />This is a book that should be read and pondered many times.

Unlike most of Dawn Powell's earlier novels, it sold well and went through several printings. Although Powell denied it, one of the major characters of the book, Amanda Keeler Evans, is based in part on and satirizes Claie Boothe Luce. These external details say little about the appeal of this novel.<br /><br />As with most of Dawn Powell's books, &#34;A Time to be Born&#34; talks about New York City and its effect on young men and women who meet their chances there from small towns in the Midwest. The book's two main characters, Amanda Keeler Evans and Vickie Haven, come to New York City under different circumstances and with different results after being girlhood friends in the town of Lakeville, Ohio.<br /><br />On the verge of WW II, Amanda has become a success by publishing a schmaltzy romantic novel and hobnobbing with the powerful under the guidance of her husband, Julian, a newspaper magnate. Amanda has married her way to success with Julian but with success will not touch much less sleep with him.<br /><br />Vicky Haven comes to New York at the peak of Amanda's success to escape the memory of a failed affair in which she has lost her love to her business partner. She is put up, begrudgingly, by Amanda who uses her pad to entertain the lover, Ken Sanders, that she jilted to marry Julian. Amanda takes the fancy pad for Vicky to have an excuse to have an affair with Ken on the side.<br />The climax of the book occurs when Vicky decides to leave Amanda's fancy pad and lease an apartment of her own. No luxury this. It is a cold-water flat on the fourth floor of a dilapated building surrounded by warehouses and with a pet shop on the lower floor. But it is Vicky's and it is where her life begins. Powell writes: &#34;She only wanted to be alone with her new house so definitely hers, because nobody, Amanda, Ethel, brother Ted, Eudora Brown, Ethel Carey, nobody would ever have selected it for her, and so it was the beginning of her own life.&#34; There is magic here, in life beginning anew, with self-affirmation and choice, even if, and especially if in Powell, the outcome is uncertain and the scene itself is partially ironic.<br /><br />In addition to the theme of having one's own start at life, the book paints a memorable picture of New York on the eve of WW II. The book juxtaposes the lives of the rich, famous and powerful -- their self-importance, their officiousness, their concern for the weighty matters of peace and war -- with the lives of the &#34;little people&#34; who, as Powell describes them, &#34;can only think that they are hungry, they haven't eaten, they have no money, the have lost their babies, their loves, their homes, and their sons mock them from prisons and insane asylums, so that rain or sun or snow or battles cannot stir their selfish personal absorption.&#34;. The little people have little to do with the fate of nations. Specifically in the book, Vicky is concerned not with affairs of state or with the rich and famous. She is concerned with love -- with the love she lost in Lakeville -- and with finding herself and a new love in New York City.<br /><br />The characters in the book are masterfully drawn from Amanda and Vicky to many of the secondary characters such as Amanda's assistant Bemel and vicky's elderly would-be lover Rockman. New York City is depicted memorably, as elsewhere in Dawn Powell's writings. In this book, the best depictions are those of the cold water flats of Grenwich Village -- of the place that Vicky finally finds to try to find a life.<br /><br />As with most of Powell's novels, this book is a satire. But in this book it is more delicate, more tinged with understanding and compassion, than is the case in some of her novels. The feelings that the book brings for its characters is the source of its magic. There is a sense of foreboding and irony in the book, but little cynicism and anger. The book occupies that fragile point at which a person is able to act on her ideals and attempt to find a life for herself -- without moving into the line that determines whether or not the effort will end in succe<br /><br />&#34;A Time to be Born&#34; is a wonderful, little-known American novel.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanson is able to act on her ideals and attempt to find a life for herself -- without moving into the line that determines whether or not the effort will end in succe<br /><br />&#34;A Time to be Born&#34; is a wonderful, little-known American novel.<br /><br />Robin Friedman	2003-02-08

As recounted in this book (page 82) it goes like this:  \\"A monk in all seriousness asked Joshu \\"has a dog Buddha-nature or not?\\"  Joshu retorted \\"Mu!\\"<br />There is a great deal in Philip Kapleau's book discussing the Koan Mu and its role in Zen -- or some forms of Zen.  Kapleau was trained as a court reporter and served as a court reporter after WW II for the war crimes trials in Nuremberg and Tokyo.  While in Japan, he became interested in Buddhism.<br />In 1953 at the age of 46 Kapleau gave up his business and his possessions in New York City to travel to Japan to study Zen.  He remained in Japan for 16 years.  Upon returning to the United States he founded the Rochester Zen Center and published \\"The Three Pillars of Zen\\".  Over the years, the book has been instrumental in introducing Americans to Zen.  The book has appeared in a 25th anniversary edition and in this 35th anniversary edition.<br />And why Zen?  Why the Koan Mu?  The most valuable part of this book is the freshness, enthusiasm, and zeal which Kapleau brought to his subject 35 years ago and which strikes the reader today.  In describing his own experiences and the experiences of other students set out in the book, Kapleau gives a good picture of the discontent and the suffering -- arising from an experience of death, illness, restlesness, or disillusion --  that lead him to leave his established life in 1953 and search for meaning in Zen.  The discussion in the book (never stated explicitly) of why people look to Zen and how Zen responds to the needs of its seekers is what gives meaning to the book.<br />The book describes long hours, months and years of sitting in  monasteries.  Another excellent feature of the book is Kapleau's realistic picture of the rigors of Zen life.  This is something that, with the spread of Zen in the United States, might be too easily forgotten.  Kapleau emphasizes the long hours of painful sitting, the use of the rod to strike students during the sitting to keep them awake, the sometimes stormy and discouraging interviews with the master teacher -- or roshi, and the frustrations and difficulties in wrestling with the Koan Mu and other Zen teaching techniques.  He describes how some people, after deep effort attain to a degree of realization.  He does not stint the difficulty and endlessness of the process, which ultimately returns the seeker to himself and to living in the everyday.<br />The book itself includes materials from a variety of sources including introductory lectures on Zen by one of Kapleau's teachers, Yasutani Roshi, a commentary on Mu, a discussion of the famous Zen \\"oxherding\\" pictures, and much more.  For me, the most revealing section of the book was the discussion in Part II of \\"Eight Contemporary Enlightenment Experiences of Japanese and Westerners\\".  These discussions gave me some insight, I think, into what the Zen path was about. I particularly learned from Kapleau's own account of his experience and from the account of the woman who became his wife.<br />Another excellent part of the book is the enlightenment letters written by a young woman named Yaekeo Iwasaki on her deathbed to her teacher, Harada-Roshi.  The letters are poinnant and Harada-Roshi's comments are revealing.<br />In reading this book, I saw that the Zen path was difficult and not for everyone.  I learned something of it and about why people are attracted to it. Zen and other forms of Buddhism have made great strides in the United States since Kapleau wrote his book.  The Three Pillars of Zen survives due to its sincerity and freshness.  It can't be institutionalized.

US	48185764	R3ADDPI90TUSHI	188364240X	761127412	Angels on Toast	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A Satire of Business	Dawn Powell published &#34;Angels on Toast&#34; in 1940 to generally favorable reviews but poor sales. She rewrote the book, shortening and softening its satire, in 1956 under the title &#34;A Man's Affair&#34;. She also wrote a TV script based on the book called &#34;You should have brought your mink&#34;. The book has been reissued several times, all in the original 1940 version.<br /><br />When the book first appeared, the critic Diana Trilling wrote a negative review. She observed that Powell was a writer of great gifts and style who, in &#34;Angels on Toast&#34;, had wasted her talents on utterly frivolous, valueless people and scenes. On reading the book, I can understand Trilling's reaction. The book isn't one of Powell's best, but its scenes are sharply-etched and entertaining. As I have frequently found in Powell's novels, the book works better in parts than as a whole, even though the story line of &#34;Angels on Toast&#34; is generally clear and coherent.<br /><br />The story is basically a satire of American business in the later 1930s with the scene shifting back and forth from Chicago to New York City. The two main protagonists are businessmen, Lou Donovan and his best friend, a less successful businessman named Jay Oliver. The two characters are pretty well differentiated from each other although both remain one-dimensional. The activities of Lou and Jay can be summarized in three terms: moneymaking, drinking and wenching. As are virtually all the characters in the book, Lou and Jay are out for the main chance in their endless trips to New York. They engage in unending bouts of hard drinking. Their sexual affairs, and the deceits they paractice on their wives and mistresses take up at least as much time as the business and the booze. Jay's mistreess is a woman named Elsie while Lou is involved with a mysterious woman named Trina Kameray. Both give just as good as they get. It is difficult to think of a book where the entire cast of characters are crass, materialistic, on the make, without sense of value. Powell portrays them sharply.<br /><br />I found the book less successful than Powell's other New York novels. I think this is because the book satirizes American business and Powell clearly has less sympathy with business than she does with the subjects of her satire in her other novels. Her other books generally deal with dissilusioned wannabe artists in Grenwich Village, with writers, nightclub entertainers, frustrated musicians, and writers resisting the tide of commercialism. Powell has knowledge of the lives of such people and sympathy with at least some of their ideals. This gives a touch of ambivalence and poignancy to the satire. But in &#34;Angels on Toast&#34;, she shows no real knowledge and no sympathy to the world of business. This, I think, makes the satire shrill and too one-sided. Also, the business world is satirized in essentially the same terms as the various components of New York society Powell satirizes in her other books -- i.e. the characters are egotistical in the extreme, heavy drinkers (always), and sexually promiscuous and unfaithful.<br /><br />Some of the individual scenes in the book are well-done. In particular, I enjoyed Powell's descriptions of a fading old New York Hotel, called the Ellery and its guests and the patrons at its bar. There are a few good scenes of train travel in the 1930's, and much sharp, punchy dialogue. The book held my interest.<br /><br />The characters are crass and one-dimensional. Powell refers to some of her minor characters repeatedly by offensive nicknames such as &#34;the snit&#34;, &#34;the floozie&#34; and &#34;the punk&#34;, which certainly don't show much attempt at a sympathetic understanding of people. The book is sharp, cutting, and more so that Powell's other books, overwhelmingly negative towards its protagonists.<br />This book has its moments. The writing style and the details are enjoyable, but the satire is too one-dimensional and heavy-handed. Although the book is worth knowing, it is one of Dawn Powell's lesser efforts.<br /><br />Robin Friedman-handed.

Dewey wrote extensively for both an academic and a public audience.  He developed a philosophy of pragmatism and contributed significantly to American education.  He was a socialist and was publically engaged througout his life in addressing the issues of the day.  In particular he criticized the President Roosevelt's New Deal for what Dewey thought was an inadequate response to the Depression and a misguided attempt to preserve capitalism.  He supported United States participation in WW I but shortly after the end of the War, he became an isolationist.  He retained this isolationist stance until Pearl Harbor.<br />Dewey's thought resists easy summation.  His writing style, particularly in his philosophical works, was long, winding, obscure and difficult to follow. As did many thinkers in the 20th Century, Dewey changed and modified his views with some frequency during the course of his life.<br />Alan Ryan has written an exellent study of John Dewey which explores Dewey's life, the influences upon him, his philosophical writings, his political activism, and the rises and falls in Dewey's reputation after his death.  The book is somewhat dense and repetitive, but this too is a characteristic of the writings of its subject.  Ryan writes insightfully in trying to place Dewey as philosophically somewhere between the despair of European existentialists such as Heidegger and Sartre and the English-American analytical philosophy of the 20th Century which denied that philosophical thought had a distinctive contribution to make to human intellectual endeavor.<br />I thought Ryan was good in discussing Dewey's early Congregationalit upbringing and his falling away from Christianity.  I also thought Ryan placed good emphasis on the Hegelian idealism which Dewey adopted early in his career.  The book could have used a fuller discussion of the nature of Hegelian idealism.  As I read Ryan's book, I thought that Dewey retained even more of a Hegelian influence in his later thought than Ryan recognized.  Dewey's emphasis on holistic thinking and on the relationship of the community and the individual remains Hegelian -- a naturalized Hegelianism as Ryan points out.<br />Ryan discussed Dewey's educational work at the University of Chicago.  This is the aspect of Dewey's work that is best known.  As Ryan points out, Dewey is often criticized for the shortcomings of American education.  He is blamed, probably unjustifiably, for a lack of discipline and academic knowledge in too many American students.  Ryan does point out, in fairness, that Dewey's actual educational theory was obscure in many points and undeveloped in specifics.  It is hard to know just what Dewey had in mind, but it surely was not laxness and a deference to the wishes of young children.<br />I thought the strongest aspect of Ryan's book was his discussion of Dewey's mature philosophical writings, in particular \\"Experience and Nature\\" \\"A Common Faith\\" and \\"Art and Experience.\\"  In these works, Dewey tried to develop a philosophical pragmatism which was based on science and secularism.  He denied the existence of an objective independent truth which science tries to capture and also denied subjectivism.  Dewey recognized that human experience could be viewed from many perspectives and he struggled to explain how many of the goals of the religious and artistic life were consistent with science and secularism.  He wanted to show them as perspectives equally important to the scientific perspective and to disclaim a concept of truth as \\"out there\\" rather than as sought,developed and made through human social activity.  Dewey's position is difficult and, to his credit, Ryan does not simplify it.  Ryan's exposition is challenging and made me want to read some of Dewey for myself.<br />A great deal of Ryan's book is devoted to Dewey's career as a public intellectual commenting on the issues of the day, as he saw them.  Dewey travelled to Russia and China, investigated the Russian show trials of Trotsky and others, supported American participation in WW I, and advocated social liberalism.  Ryan discusses Dewey's positions fully and intelligently and explores how Dewey's issues remain alive in the late 20th (and early 21st)century.  The discussion of American political life and of the role of ideas is fascinating even though I frequently did not agree either with Dewey or with Ryan.<br />Ryan recognizes the paradoxical nature of the work of this American thinker. Dewey was a philosopher who critized sharply thought and reflection separate from action.  He was a secularist who saw the importance of religion.  He recognized the nature of industrial society but stressed the importance of art and culture.  Dewey was, as Ryan points out in his conclusion<br />something of a visionary of the everyday.  Ryan writes (page 269):  \\"It was his ability to infuse the here and now with a kind of transcendent glow that overcame the denseness and awkwardness of his prose and the vagueness of his message and secured such widespread conviction. .... He will remain for the forseeable future a rich source of intellectual nourishment for anyone not absolutely locked within the anxieties of his or her own heart and not absolutely despondent about the prospects of the modern world.\\"Dewey for myself.<br />A great deal of Ryan's book is devoted to Dewey's career as a public intellectual commenting on the issues of the day, as he saw them.

But this poignant, mostly understated novel set in a drab midwestern town called Dell River is a gem.<br />The two main characters in the book are Connie Benjamin and Blaine Decker.  When we meet Connie as a housewife in her mid-thirties, she is leading a life she finds sterile and barren with her husband Gus, a cobbler, and her two adolescent daughters. As a young woman, Connie had visions of a career as an opera singer, even though this ambition seemed to be based on little more than a commendation of her voice by a famous teacher.  Connie also has a past in which she ran off with a young man named Tony who did acrobatics with a circus.  Tony aboandoned her, and Connie lives with dreams of a singing career that perhaps could have been and with faded memories of Tony.<br />Blaine Decker comes to Dell River as the high school music teacher.  He rents a small apartment above Gus Decker's shoe repair shop.  Decker is a pianist by training (with small hands) who likewise has never had the artistic success of which he dreams.  He spent his early years in Europe during which time he was a friend of a writer, Starr Donnell, who had written, as far as Decker knows, one novel.  Powell hints throughout the novel at Decker's repressed homosexuality.<br />The novel explores the relationship that develops between Connie and Blaine.  With their shared love of music and their broken, and probably illusory dreams,  they feel stifled by the small town of Dell River.  They share confidences with each other and at the same time quarrel severely with each other over their respective failures to pursue their dreams.  The relationship is at bottom frustrating and unconsummated.  It never becomes sexual.<br />There are wonderful pictures in this book of music and its capacity to bring meaning to life.  The seriousness with which Powell discusses the pursuit of classical music in this work contrasts markedly with her picture of frivolous people and activities in her subsequent satirical New York novels.  Powell also shows how music can be a means by which people evade their own selves and their own reality.  There are also good depictions in the book of life in a small town, particularly those people who teach in High Schools, and of many secondary characters.<br />As do Powell's latter works, this book contrasts life in a small town with life in the cosmopolitian city, here represented by Paris more than by New York.  But there is a certain inward focus to this book which is not shared by her latter satirical pictures of New York.  The characters here are limited by Dell River and its environs, but their problems and discontents lie within themselves, in their lack of self-knowledge, and in their failed dreams.  The book lacks the sharp cynicism of the latter novels but features instead reflectiveness and sadness.<br />Powell's writing style in this novel is rather flatter than in her subsequent works but it fits the atmosphere of Dell River that she conveys.  There are several moments in the novel or lyricism and intensity.<br />This probably is not a novel that will ever enjoy wide readership.

He served eight years as the Secretary of the Interior under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.  He is also, as this book shows, a thougthful student of the history of the American West.  He combines a breadth of study with a personal touch and with stories from the experience of his family in the West that adds to the eloquence of his book.<br />\\"The Forgotten Founders\\" covers a great deal of terrain in a brief compass. Udall's goal is to show the importance of individual settlers in establishing the American West. Udall writes (p.37):<br />\\"A shortcoming of histories that concentrate on broad outlines of events is the absence of human faces and stories of ordinary folk that would reveal what animated individuals and families and indicate the experiences they had.  Yet only by considering individual human experience can we begin to develop a sense of what these men and women faced and an idea of the magnitude of their achievements.\\"<br />Udall's approach has a distincly Jeffersonian cast in emphasizing the role of small yeoman farmers to an independent citizenry. He discusses and quotes Thomas Jefferson to good effect (p. 135). Jefferson said:<br />\\"Cultivators of the earth are the most valuable citizens.  They are the most vigorous, the most independent, the most virtuous, and they are tied to their country, and wedded to its liberty and interests, by the most lasting bonds.\\"<br />Udall also emphasizes the importance of religion as a motivating and civilizing force in the West's early development.  He focuses poignantly upon the experience of his own ancestors, early adherents of the Mormon Church and influential in the development of the Mormon Church in Utah. His discussion culminates in a lengthy and forthright discussion of the Mountain Meadows Massacre of 1857.  John D. Lee, Udall's great-grandfather was instrumental in this unhappy event and was executed in 1875 for his role in the massacre.<br />Udall gives substantial attention to Catholic and Protestant efforts as well.  He correctly points out that in a secular age, many people tend to denigrate the importance of religion as a motivating factor for people.  The settlers of the West did not share some of the modern skepticism and cannot be understood apart from a consideration of the importance of religion to their lives.  I was reminded particularly of Willa Cather's \\"Death Comes to the Archbishop.\\"  Udall discusses Cather (p 187) but might have considered her picture of Catholicism in the West in more detail as it supports his argument.<br />In emphasizing the role of the small settler and of religion, Udall downplays the role of explorers such as Lewis and Clark and fur traders.  He also tends to denigrate the role of the California gold rush of 1849 as having a lasting impact on Western development.  He criticizes and downplays the importance of capitalist development of the West in mining, grazing and other large-scale activities following the Civil War.  He is critical of the U.S. Military's efforts in \\"pacifying\\" the Indians.  He also debunks popular sterotypes of the West that Hollywood and popular culture has fashioned elevating characters such as Billy the Kid and Wyatt Earp to a legendary status.<br />Udall has important things to say about the human and environmental costs of the gold rush and of the mining and grazing industries.  In particular, he points repeatedly to the mistreatment of the American Indians and also to the mistreatment of Chinese immigrants in the early history of the West.  But at times he seems to me to confuse his point that Western development, in terms of the gold rush and the development of capitalism, say, had deleterious effects on the West's development with the point that they had no role to play in this development at all. This latter position appears to be overstated, even on the evidence of Udall's book. Udall also gives too little attention to the integration of the efforts of the settlers with the efforts of the capitalists, the gold-rushers, and the Army.  These parties may have been working with related goals and not separately as Udall too often assumes.<br />Professor David Emmons of the University of Montana has written a fine introduction to Udall's book.  Professor Emmons's own book, \\"The Butte Irish: Class and Ethnicity in an American Mining Town, 1875-1925\\" figures prominently in Udall's discussion (p. 157) of alternatives to the development of the profit-obsessed company mining town which various communities in the West were able to use on occasion.<br />This is a good study which is valuable in its emphasis on the efforts of individuals and on the importance of religion to the settlement of the West.

It sets forth, defends, and applies an important view of the nature of human liberty, government, and economics that is worth considering, at the least, and that has much to commend it. The book is carefully written and argued with extensive and substantive footnotes and with an \\"analytical table of contents\\" that is useful in following the details of the argument. The book is highly erudite. It is also passionately argued. Hayek believed he had an important message to convey.<br />Hayek's states his theory in part I of this book, titled \\"The Value of Freedom\\". He seeks to explore the nature of the ideal of freedom (liberty) and to explain why this ideal is valuable and worth pursuing. He finds the nature of freedom in the absence of coercion on a person by another person or group. He argues that in giving the broadest scope of action to each individual, society will benefit in ways that cannot be forseen in advance or planned and each person will be allowed to develop his or her capacities. Hayek summarizes his views near the end of his book (p. 394):<br />\\" [T]he ultimate aim of freedom is the enlargement of those capacities in which man surpasses his ancestors and to which each generation must endeavor to add its share -- its share in the growth of knowledge and the gradual advance of moral and aesthetic beliefs, where no superior must be allowed to enforce one set of views of what is right or good and where only further experience can decide what should prevail.\\"<br />The book focuses on issues of economic freedom and on the value of the competitive market. Hayek has been influenced by writers such as David Hume, Edmund Burke, and John Stuart Mill in \\"On Liberty.\\"<br />Part II of the book discusses the role of the State in preserving liberty. It develops a view of law which sees its value in promoting the exercise of individual liberty. The approach is historic.  Hayek discusses with great sympathy the development of the common law and of American constitutionalism -- particularly as exemplified by James Madison.<br />In Part III of the book, Hayek applies his ideas about the proper role of government in allowing the exercise of individual liberty to various components of the modern welfare state. Each of the chapters is short and suggestive, rather than comprehensive.  Hayek relies on technical economic analysis, and on his understanding of economic theory, as well as on his philosophical commitments, in his discussion. What is striking about Hayek's approach is his openness (sometimes to the point of possible inconsistency with his philosophical arguments). He tries in several of his chapters to show how various aspects of the modern welfare state present threats to liberty in the manner in which he has defined liberty. But he is much more favorably inclined to some aspects of these programs than are some people, and on occasion he waffles. This is the sign of a thoughtful mind, principled but undoctrinaire.<br />I think there is much to be learned from Hayek. He probably deserves more of a hearing than he gets. For a nonspecialist returning to a book such as this after a long time off, it is good to think of other positions which differ from Hayek's in order to consider what he has to say and to place it in context. For example, in an essay called \\"Liberty and Liberalism\\" in his \\"Taking Rights Seriously\\" (1977) the American legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin discusses Mill's \\"On Liberty\\" with a reference to Hayek. Dworkin argues that for Mill, liberty meant not the absence of coercion but rather personal independence. Mill was distinguishing between personal rights and economic rights, according to Dworkin. Thus Dworkin would claim that Hayek overemphasizes the value of competitiveness and lack of state economic regulation in the development of Hayek's concept of liberty.<br />The British political thinker Isaiah Berlin seems to suggestto me, as I read Hayek's argument, that there are other human goods in addition to liberty, as Hayek defines liberty.  Further, Hayek does not establish that liberty, as he understands it, is always the ultimate human good to which others must give place.  It may often be that good, but there may also be circumstances in which other goods should be given a more preeminent role when human well-being is at issue. In thinking about Hayek, it would also be useful to understand and to assess his concept of liberty by comparing and contrasting his approach to that of John Rawls in his \\"A Theory of Justice.\\"<br />Hayek's book is important, thought-provoking and valuable. Probably no writer of a book of political philosophy can be asked for more. It deserves to be read and pondered. It has much to teach, both where it may persuade the reader and where it encourages the reader to explore competing ideas.t to me, as I read Hayek's argument, that there are other human goods in addition to liberty, as Hayek defines liberty.

Among her lovers are Clive Linely, a successful British composer, Vernon Halliday, the editor of a formerly highbrow but failing paper called The Judge, and Julian Garamony, a foreign secretary with even higher political aspirations.  The story revolves around the relationships of Linely, Halliday, and Garamony, and their ties to Molly.<br />Each of the three men is involved in something of a moral crisis.  Linely is working on a symphony he hopes will prove his masterpiece when he has to decide whether to interfere in what may be a rape.  Halliday has to decide whether to compromise his failing paper by publishing sexually explicit and compromising pictures of Garamony that Molly had taken.  Linely and Halliday sign a euthanasia pact and then quarrel over the moral choices each man must face.<br />The book is slender, elegant, and, alas, superficial.  It is pleasant to read but lacks depth.  The most interesting part of the book for me is the interest the author shows in music through the composer in the book, Linely.  For me, music became the focus of attention in the book, even though Linely is basically arrogant and mediocre and only one of three or four characters in the tangled plot of the book.<br />At the outset of Amsterdam, Linely is writing a commissioned symphony to celebrate the millenium but is experiencing difficulty in finishing the work and in finding an appropriately lyrical theme to end the last movement.  He wants a theme that will capture both the horrors of the 20th Century and mankind's hopes and aspirations for the future -- shades of the Beethoven Ninth in more ways than one.  Also like Beethoven, Linely derives inspiration from nature.  To find an environment enabling him to complete his symphony, Linely takes a break to visit a wild, lonely place where he witnesses an apparent rape.  Linely fancies himself a genius -- which he is not -- and displays something of an imitation of Beethoven's attitude and work habits -- such as the trip to nature.  Of course this is hardly the first time a musician has defined himself in reference to Beethoven.<br />Other works of Linely are mentioned in the course of the novel as are other composers.  Linely has set a series of poems called \\"rage\\" by an American beat named Hart Pullman. (Hart has also slept with Molly in his younger days.)  He has written a piece which was performed only once called \\"Symphonic Dervishes for Virtuoso Strings.\\"  Linely has also written a book called \\"Reading Beauty\\" which claims that blues, rock, jazz, and folk have been the truly innovative music of the 20th Century.<br />One critic dubs Linely the \\"thinking man's Gorecki\\" and then recants to call Gorecki the \\"thinking man's Linely.\\"  Gorecki is a mid-20th century composer whose third symphony (\\"Lamentations\\") has won deserved fame.  There are references to English composers such as Britten, Williams and Purcell.  At one point, when his own symphony is about to be trashed, Linely expresses disdain for concertgoers attending a program of Schubert. \\"Hadn't the world heard enough from syphilitic Schubert?\\" Linely asks.<br />I was taken with the discussion of music in the book much more than with the plot and with the egoism, arrogance, and lust that the characters convey.

US	48185764	R2TLMS19YXNPAY	0140268863	627065254	The Odyssey	Books	5	6	6	N	N	The Journey of the West	Homer's Odyssey is the prototypical \\"journey\\" of Western literature. The epic tells of the wanderings of the Greek hero Odysseus, King of Ithaca. Odysseus spent ten years with the Greeks at Troy (he is an important character in Homer's Iliad) and devised the strategem of the Trojan Horse which led to the fall of Troy.  Following the fall of Troy, Odysseus wandered for ten years before his return to Ithaca.  The Odyssey celebrates his trials during this long period and his ultimate vindication upon his return to Ithaca.<br />The Odyssey differs in tone and content from the Iliad. Simone Weil, a mid-20th century French writer, described the Iliad as the work of Western literature which best explored the use and limitations of force.  Battle scenes, death, and the human cost and folly of war are realistically if heroically described. The Odyssey is more in the nature of romance.  It surely has moments of grandeur and heroism, but its story is in the telling and in the journeying and in the adventures of Odysseus along the way.<br />The tale of the Iliad, and of Achilles wrath, involves only a few days in the Trojan War and the poet of the Iliad recounts his story in a forward-moving chronology. The story is focused in that the main action takes place entirely in Troy and its environs. The Odyssey is much more diffuse, covering as it does the wanderings of Odysseus for ten years.  The scene shifts frequently and the story is told with flashbacks and shifting tenses and locations.  The bulk of the action (the last 12 books of the epic) occur in Ithaca after Odysseus returns home.  These books are recounted in the voice of the poet. (Homer)  The first four books of the Odyssesy recount a smaller-scale journey of Telemachus, Odysseus's son, as he searches for news of his father and tries to avoid death at the hands of the suitors of Penelope who are plaguing Ithaca and plundering Odysseus's estate.  (In addition, many of the women servants are having affairs with the suitors.)  The middle section of the book deals with Odysseus's adventures, with mythical characters such as the Cyclops, Scylla and Charibdis, the rock-throwing Laestroginians, the Lotus eaters, the sirens, and many others.  We learn of Odyseeus's long but ultimately unsatisfactory dalliances with Circe and with Callypso and his perseverance in returning home.<br />The most striking element of the poem for me was Book 11 which chronicles Odysseus's journey to Hades and which teaches him that human life is precious and irreplaceable for all its pain and suffering.  Much of the middle section of the book is told as a flashback with Odysseus speaking in his own voice.  There is much in the Odyssey (unlike the Iliad) about the nature and function of epic poetry and about its performance.<br />The Odyseesy concludes with Odysseus' slaughter of the many suitors of his faithful wife Penelope and with his reuniting with his wife, aged father Laertes and son Telemachus.  Odysseus is a wily, much-battered, and cunning,hero.  But in his perseverance and strength, he is a hero nonetheless.<br />The Odyssey is a much-translated work. I found Fagles's translation helped me get into and involved with the poem.  The translation is in a modern American free verse idiom which to me lets the poem speak and does not call attention to itself as a translation. For a work such as the Odyssey, I think that if the translation moves and the reader is drawn into the work, the translator is doing a good job.  By this test, the translation is outstanding.<br />There is an excellent introduction by Bernard Knox which introduces the reader to the scholarly issues surrounding the composition of the Odyssey and the Iliad and which discusses as well the major themes of the poem.<br />The Odyssey and the Iliad are works to be read and reread at many stages of life.  They should probably be explored in several translations for those, (most readers) who don't read the original Greek.  This is a stirring epic poem of what has become the journey of the West.epic poem of what has become the journey of the West.	2003-01-02

Powell grew up in Mt. Gilead, Ohio, but left this small midwestern town to seek her career in New York City. She wrote &#34;The Wicked City&#34; in 1938, and the novel captures both the allure and the disappointment of fast-paced sophisticated New York. Although the satire is sharp and biting, Powell shows considerable ambivalence for both the small town she left and the cosmopolitanism she adopted.<br /><br />&#34;The Happy Island&#34; opens with its protagonist, Jefferson Abbott, arriving in the New York City bus terminal from Silver City, Ohio to make his career as a budding playwright. Jefferson is serious, stodgy in character and is taken aback by what he sees as the frivolity and shallowness of the New York cultural and entertainment community on which he hopes to make his mark. In New York, he meets another transplant from Silver City and an old flame, Prudence Bly. Prudence has survived the and mastered New York show business to a degree. She is a successful nightclub singer with many contacts. As adolescents in Silver City, (16 years before the story begins) Jefferson and Prudence had a teenage romance. When the pair was caught necking behind the railroad, Prudence received the sobriquet &#34;Tracks&#34; from the mocking young men of Silver City. In New York, Jefferson remains attracted to Prudence but dismayed by the life she is leading as a nightclub singer and socialite.<br /><br />The plot of &#34;The Happy Island&#34; centers around the relationship between Jefferson and Prudence and in the contrast between New York City, New York and Silver City, Ohio. But as elsewhere in Powell, the plot of the book is the least of its attractions. The value of the book lies in its depiction of the places and people of New York City, in Powell's writing style, and in her sharp, caustic one-liners. There is an underlying sense of morality lost.<br /><br />The book features a plethora of characters from the New York entertainment and literary scene. In particular, this book is somewhat unusual because several of the characters in the book are gay or bisexual, and Powell presents these characters without any particular moralizing. The moral tone of the book, though, is sharp and critical. In general, the characters in the book exhibit the morals of the barnyard. Infidelity, promiscuity, and double-crossing are the rules of the day. Together with the sexual double and triple dealing, Powell emphasizes parties and alcohol. She is good at describing party scenes and even better at emphasizing the dependence of her characters on booze. One can sympathize with some of Jefferson Abbott's reaction to this environment.<br /><br />With all its sharpness, irony and satire, New York City is presented with a certain magic and allure. It is the dream of a new life and of opportunity, for Powell and for many others. Inflated hopes and ideals too often lead to cynicism, as I think this book and other books by Powell suggest. In the introduction to this book, Tim Page concludes that &#34;The Happy Island&#34; is a relatively minor novel of Dawn Powell.

In its sweep lies war and death, honor and pettiness, mortality, domesticity, gods and men.<br />In his excellent introduction to this edition, Bernard Knox tells us that the Iliad probably was written down between 725 and 675 B.C.  It tells a story that was archaic even for its time that is set around 1200 B.C. The story of the Iliad covers a matter of days in the tenth and final year of the Trojan War.  It is allusive to the entire mythology of that ancient struggle. The tale is deliberately mythical, with characters and emotions that, Homer tells us many times, are larger than those of men today. For too many, the Iliad comes encrusted as a \\"classic\\". People read it, or portions of it, in high school or college and inevitably miss much of the grandeur and wisdom of the work.<br />When I came back to the Iliad recently (after not having read the work in many years) in Fagles' translation, I was swept away.  I accompanied my reading of the Iliad with an excellent series of lecture tapes on the poem and its background.  I thought the translation, written in a modern colloquial free verse helped me to understand and read the poem.  The translation, for me, gives the reader a sense of the repetitions, formulas and phraseology of the original.  It has a sweep to it, and the style and translation does not get in the way of understanding the work.  This is important in a modern translation of an ancient work.  The translation was easy to follow and got me involved in the tale.  I am sure the poem works differently in the ancient Greek than in this translation.  But this is largely irrelevant to the virtue of Fagles's work which makes the Iliad come alive and roar in a manner which encourages the nonclassicist modern reader to approach it.<br />There are a mulitude of themes in the Iliad.  At the beginning of the work, Homer invokes his muse and announces that the work will deal with the \\"rage of Achilles.\\"  The work is about human anger and rage on a grand scale and about the waste, but strange grandeur of war. In his introduction, Bernard Knox quotes approvingly from Simone Weil, writing in France during World War II, who described the Iliad as the West's leading work on the use and nature of Force. The Iliad speaks deeply about the human condition, about the tragedy and heroism that human mortality makes possible, and about how people may learn to change and to understand others.<br />I found Bernard Knox' introduction and notes helpful in understanding the controversies surrounding the writing of the Iliad and in giving the reader some of the basic tools to think about the work.  Whether the reader is approaching the Iliad for the first time or after many times, there is much to be gained from reading this basic text of the West.

The reconstructionists, led by the Radical Republicans in Congress wanted to protect,implement, and perhaps expand the rights of the newly freed blacks. The reconciliationists favored putting the Civil War behind the United States and creating a sense of nationalism among sections that, up to 1865, had been bitter enemies.<br /><br />Professor Blight traces the tension between these two competing visions from 1863, when President Lincoln gave his Gettysburg address, through 1913, which witnessed a reunion of Civil War veterans at Gettysburg and a commemorative speech by the then-President, Woodrow Wilson.<br /><br />Professor Blight drawns heavily on the work of recent scholars such as Eric Foner (and his predecessors) which has changed the way many historians view the Reconstruction Era. Professors Blight and Foner reject the view that Reconstruction was primarily an era of carpetbaggers, corruption and victimization of the South. The see it instead as a necessary attempt to protect black Americans. Reconstuction was gradually rejected and came to an end in 1876. The end of Reconstruction saw the rise of Jim Crow and segregation in the South with tragic consequences that would not be redressed until the Civil Rights Era of the mid-twentieth Century. The consequences remain with us.<br /><br />According to Professor Blight, the Reconciliationist picture relegated the treatment of Black Americans to secondary significance. This picture focused instead on the common threads that existed between North and South and particularly between their fighting forces. The militaries of both sides were motivated by patriotism, valor and courage, as they saw it. They fought for what they believed in, with, in the Reconciliatist approach, the cause of the War in slavery carefully omitted or marginalized. The Reconciliationist approach led in time, Professor Blight argues, to the myth of the Lost Cause and to the romanticization of the Old South.<br /><br />Professor Blight has amassed a great amount of learning and familiarity with primary source material to discuss the Reconstuctionist and Reconciliationist approaches to American History subsequent to the Civil War. He treats in detail much important American literature, including writers such as Walt Whitman, Steven Crane, Joel Chandler Harris, and Ambrose Bierce, among many others. He discusses Civil War writing by battlefiled participants that appeared in great quantity beginning in the late 1870's together with the memoirs of Civil War Generals, particularly Grant and Sherman. He discusses the work of Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois, Booker T. Washington and other black leaders. And he discusses works from politicians and apologists in both North and South.<br /><br />The book is an excellent study of the American experience following the Civil War. I think it is persuasive for the most part. In places, I think Professor Blight creates too much of a dichotomy between the Reconstructionist and Reconciliationist pictures. I think there was and is room for both visions. More importantly, the sources Professor Blight discusses show that there were many competing versions of the Civil War and its meanings, not all of which fall readily into the camp of either Reconstruction and Reconciliation.<br /><br />Following the Civil War, the United States needed to both secure the Civil Rights of Black Americans and also provide for a new American union and sense of Nationalism. Neither purpose was achieved fully or entirely well. We are working on them both today. Professor Blight has shown the tragedy of the War. He has also shown the serious consequences to our country of the long delay in fully addressing the Civil Rights of all American people. This is a worthwhile, thoughtful study of the legacy ofthe Civil War, but it does not provide the only word on the subject.<br /><br />Robin Friedman<br /><br />.the Civil War, but it does not provide the only word on the subject.<br /><br />Robin Friedman<br /><br />.	2002-12-09

Powells' biographer, Tim Page, has written of this book that &#34;if there is another novel that manages simultaneously to be so funny and so sad, so riotous and so realistic, so acute and yet so accepting in the portrayal of flawed humankind, I have not yet found it.&#34; This is high praise for an obscure novel, but it is deserved.<br /><br />The protagonist of the book is Dennis Orphen, a young man who, modeled on Dawn Powell herself, has left Midwest Ohio to come to New York City in search of a literary career and of excitement.<br />Orphen begins as a &#34;proletarian&#34; leftist type of writer but soon achieves some popular acclaim. He then publishes a novel, &#34;The Hunter's Wife&#34; which satirizes sharply a famous American writer who has long lived abroad, Andrew Callingham (a Hemingway-like figure.) Orphen has learned about the details of Calligham's life through his three-year affair with Effie, Callingham's first wife whom Callingham had left 18 years earlier. (Effie is much older than Orphen.) Effie is despondent over the revelations in Orphen's book. Orphen also has affairs with other women, particularly a young married woman named Corrine, who loves Orphen but also loves her good if boring home with her husband.<br /><br />The book is full of pictures of New York City streets, bars, homes and characters. It satirizes the literary establishment and literary tastes of the day unmercifully. The plot in the story turns on Orphen's attempt to reconcile what he has done as a writer -- written a fine novel -- with the betrayal of Effie. He needs to sort out his feeling for her and for Corrine.<br /><br />Effie too needs to sort out her feelings towards Orphen and towards Callingham, her long-gone husband. She has the opportunity to do so when Callingham returns briefly to New York City. The title of the book, &#34;Turn, Magic Wheel&#34;, is taken from an epigraph of Theocritus: &#34;Turn, magic wheel, Bring homeward him I love&#34; and is suggestive of the plot.<br /><br />Some readers see this book is sharp, unremitting satire. I find it much more. It tells an unconventional love story lived by people with unconventional sexual mores. Dawn Powell brings real sympathy and understanding to the characters and their situation. The book is a beautiful portrait of New York City of the mid-1930's. It captures the allure of leaving one's youth in the Midwest and seeking life in the excitement of Manhattan.

In the most obvious sense, the book tells the story of \\"half a life\\" because it covers the life of its protagonist, Willie Somerset Chandran, up to the age of 41. (Slightly more than half the human lifespan of threescore and ten).  At the end of the book, the reader is left to wonder about the manner in which Willie's subsequent life will develop from the story we are told in the novel.<br />In another sense, the novel tells the story of \\"half a life\\" in terms of quality rather than quantity (length of life).  Willie leads only half a fully-developed human life in the book because of his frustration, for sexual as well as other reasons, and lack of purpose.  As Willie comes to realize, the reader comes to realize the rather empty character of Willie's life.<br />Perhaps another sense in which the novel tells the story of \\"half a life\\" is that the author does not tell us Willie's full story.  We learn about his frustrated ambitions, his family, his travels, and something of his sexuality.  The book seems to suggest that there is more to the character, both within him and without him, than the author tells us.<br />A final sense in which the book tells of \\"half a life\\" lies in its autobiographical character.  The book seems to be based in part on Naipaul's own life.  But it does so by taking details from an actual lived life and scrambling them up and changing them through imagination, just in the way that Willie in the novel uses movie plots to create his volume of short stories.  For example in the book Willie is born in India, goes to college in England as a scholarship student, and then lives in Mozambique.  Naipaul was born in Trinidad, went to England as a scholarship student, and has written much about India.<br />All these possible meanings to the term \\"half a life\\" focus on Willie's lack of self-knowledge and his difficulty in attaining it.  Willie seems the constant outsider.  He is never comfortable with himself of where he is.  He has no real plan or purpose for himself.  In the book, he learns that he is a writer of promise and produces a good first volume of short stories.  But he doesn't follow-up and leads a drifting life in Mozambique for 18 years.  Equally important, Willie is sexually frustrated and, as he stresses, sexually ignorant.  Willie's sexual frustration has its beginning in the India of his boyhood and in the unhappy relationship between his parents.  It continues through his college years in London where he has sexual relationships with his friends' girlfriends and with prostitutes.  And in Mozambique he continues his relationships with young African prostitutes and with the wives of acquaintances.<br />The story is for the most part astringently told.  The book is in three large sections which describe Willie's life in India, his life as a student in London, and his years in Mozambique.  I was greatly drawn into the first two parts of the book, particularly the middle section describing Willie's student days in London.  The third lengthy section describing Willie's life in Mozambique in the final years of colonial rule falls off, alas, markedly.<br />This is a very tough-minded book about its protagonist's inability to come to terms with himself, to find a goal in life he can pursue and a full human sexual relationship.

He wrote several scholarly works on African-American history which are still valuable. He helped found the NAACP and for many years edited its magazine, The Crisis, which worked agressively and tirelessly for civil and political rights for African-Americans.  Near the end of his long life, Du Bois became embittered with the United States.  He became a communist,, renounced his American citizenship, and died in Ghana in 1963 at the age of 95.<br /><br />In his informative and clearly-written history, Professor Wolters discusses the nature of Du Bois's accomplishment by discussing his relationships, his agreements and disagreements, with other African-American leaders of his day.  The book is an important study of the history of black America (indeed of all America) and it sets out the many and varied approaches African-American leaders have used to bring justice to their people.  Not surprisingly, it shows areas of agreement but also areas of strong disagreement and in-fighting.<br /><br />Professor Wolters contrasts Du Bois, with his emphasis on academic education and on agressive support of civil rights, with that of Du Bois's predecessor and rival, Booker T. Washington.  He also stresses the large areas of agreement between the two men.  Similarly, Wolters discusses Du Bois's reactions to Marcus Garvey, a black leader in the 1920's with broad mass appeal who tried to get American blacks to unite and establish a homeland in Africa.  He points out that late in his career Du Bois came close to Garvey's position in many ways, involving African-American self-help from the bottom-up rather than from the top-down. Wolters then describes Du Bois's break with the NAACP and its leader Walter White.  The break was occasioned by the NAACP's commitment to integration.  Du Bois had moved away from this approach arguing instead that black Americans ought to work among themselves and within their community to achieve economic, political and social justice.  Wolters gives a relatively brief treatment to Du Bois's final years.<br /><br />Wolters finds that a philosophy of pluralism governed Du Bois's efforts throughout his long career.  Under his concept of pluralism, black Americans had two identities: an American identity and a black identity.  He urged that blacks live in both worlds -- in other words, he urged African-Americans to share in the values of the American experience while creating their own uniquely black contribution to America and to civilization.  Early in his career, Du Bois expressed his pluralistic vision as follows (Wolters, p.38):<br /><br />\\"One ever feels his two-ness,-an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn assunder.  The history of the American Negro is the history of this strife.\\"<br /><br />In his commitment to pluralism, Du Bois opposed the earlier 19th Century African-American leader, Frederick Douglass, who was assimilationist in his thinking (there should be no differences between Americans of different colors) as well as, to a degree, later-day integrationists, such as the NAACP and Dr. King.  He came closer to the views of Garvey and to the views of Garvey's more modern successors. Du Bois became more militant in his beliefs as he aged.<br /><br />There is a long disagreement between assimilationist and pluralist visions of America in many areas besides African-American history.  The tension between the two visions is still with us today as we try to understand and shape our country.  The assimilationist vision is that of a melting pot.  Pluralists speak in terms of instruments in a symphony orchestra, each with its own voice yet contributing toa whole.<br /><br />Wolters book does not describe in great detail the broader issues between assimilationism and pluralism.  He gives an excellent carefully-crafted account of how this question affected African-Americans in their quest for justice.  In expressing his own opinions in the book, Wolters is careful to point out areas of alternative interpretations among scholars.  The reader thus may form his or her own opinions.<br /><br />This book is a fine study of the life and ideas of a man who, as Wolters observes, is one of the leading figures of the 20th Century.in great detail the broader issues between assimilationism and pluralism.

I thought invariably of Nathanael West's &#34;Day of the Locust&#34; set in Hollywood, besides New York City that other center of American dreams. West's novel is a novel of irony which depicts conformity, crassness, and lovelessness in a manner that does resemble Powell's novel. There are parallels in Powell's book with many other novels as well.<br /><br />&#34;The Locusts have no King&#34; is set in New York City between the period of the end of WW II and the first test nuclear explosion on Bikini Atoll in 1947. The novel is a story of fallen ideals and of the difficult effort required to keep and recover at least some sense of one's ideals. The ideals in question are primarily those of true love and passion and also those of following and remaining faithful to one's dream -- in the case of this book, the dream of writing<br /><br />The story is told in Powell's sharply ironical voice. Some readers find her voice cool, brittle and impersonal. But I got involved with the main characters and found it moving.<br />The central character of the book is Frederick, a serious writer and scholar (not attached to any university) who studies medieval history and writes books and articles which few people read. For many years, he has been carrying on an affair with a woman named Lyle, who writes plays together with her crippled husband. Frederick's head is termed by what we today would call a bimbo appropriately named Dodo. (&#34;Pooh on you&#34;!, she says, throughout the book) At the same time, Frederick's financial fortune turns when his publisher prevails upon him to edit a periodical appropriately named &#34;Haw&#34; which becomes a commercial success.<br /><br />The main plot of the story involves Frederick's attempt to understand and put his love life and his writing life back together. Powell develops this basically serious story is an atmosphere of superficiality. The story moves forward in the bars and pubs of New York City and in party scenes among those on the make. Powell is a master at describing the bars and the streets of New York and in depicting party chatter. The book is full of tart, cutting one-liners and of aphorisms. The theme of fallen ideals in love and thinking is carried through in the settings of the story. Powell has a deeply ambivalent attitude, I think, towards these settings. She clearly knows them well.<br /><br />This is not a book to be read for the author's skill in plotting. The book is cluttered with many characters and incidents. Powell is a wonderful prose stylist in this book as in her other novels that I have read. In this book I found places where the prose as well as the characters were cluttered and laid on too thick. The strength of the book lies in its description of New York and in Powell's description of how ideals and visions can come short. I found this poignantly displayed.<br /><br />Powell's own description of &#34;The Locusts have no King&#34; offers valuable insight into what the book has to offer. She wrote:<br /><br />&#34;The theme ... deals with the disease of destruction sweeping though our times... each person out to destroy whatever valuable or beautiful thing life has... The moral is ... one must cling to whatever remnants of love, friendship, or hope above and beyond reason that one has, for the enemy is all around ready to snatch it.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;The Locusts have no King&#34; is an excellent novel by a deservedly rediscovered American writer.<br /><br />Robin FriedmanThe main plot of the story involves Frederick's attempt to understand and put his love life and his writing life back together.

The book was published in 1861 through the efforts of Maria Child, an abolitionist who edited the book and wrote an introduction to it.  The book had its origin in a series of letters Jacobs wrote between 1853 and 1861 to her friends in the abolitionist movement, notably a woman named Amy Post. Historically, there was some doubt about the authorship of the book and about the authenticity of the incidents it records.  These doubts have largely been put to rest by the discovery of the letters.<br />The book indeed has elements of a disguise and of a novel.  Jacobs never uses her real name but calls herself instead \\"Linda Brent.\\"  The other characters in the book are also given pseudonyms.  Jacobs tells us in the Preface to the book (signed \\"Linda Brent\\") that she changed names in order to protect the privacy of indiduals but that the incidents recounted in the narrative are \\"no fiction\\".<br />Jacobs was born in slave rural North Carolina.  As a young girl, she learned to read and write, which was highly rare among slaves.  At about the age of 11 she was sent to live as a slave to a doctor who also owned a plantation, called \\"Dr. Flint\\" in the book.<br />Jacobs book describes well the cruelties of the \\"Peculiar Institution -- in terms of its beatings, floggings, and burnings, overwork, starvation, and dehumanization.  It focuses as well upon the selling and wrenching apart of families that resulted from the commodification of people in the slave system.  But Jacobs' book is unique in that it describes first-hand the sexual indignities to which women were subjected in slavery.  (Other accounts, such as those of Frederick Douglass, were written by men.)  The book is also unusual in that Jacobs does not portray herself entirely as a hero but describes the nature of the steps she took to avoid becoming the sexual slave of Flint.  Thus, when Flint subjected her to repeated sexual advances from the time Jacobs reached the age of 16, she tried to avoid him by beginning an affair with a white, single attorney with whom she had two children.  When Flint's advances persisted, Jacobs formed the determination to try to secure her freedom.<br />The bulk of the book describes how Jacobs hid precariously in a cramped attic for seven years waiting for the opporunity to secure her freedom.  There are also accounts of her prior attempts to leave slavery, including a particularly harrowing account of several days in a place aptly named \\"Snaky Swamp.\\"<br />Jacobs describes her relationship with her grandmother, a free black woman who was probably the major inspiration of her life.  She also describes well her love and concern for her children, conceived through the liasion with the white attorney.<br />This book offers a rare perspective on American slavery as it affected women.  It is also a testament, I think, to the value of literacy and knowledge as an instrument for winning and preserving free human life. Although this story is not pretty, it is a testament to human persistence in the face of adversity and to the precious character of human freedom.when Flint subjected her to repeated sexual advances from the time Jacobs reached the age of 16, she tried to avoid him by beginning an affair with a white, single attorney with whom she had two children.

As a young man, her was excommunicated by the elders of the Jewish community in Amsterdam and subsequently came to be regarded by some as a &#34;secular saint&#34; and by others as an infamous atheist. Although there are many legends and myths about Spinoza's life, there has been no extended biography in English until Nadler's study. In fact, outside of brief accounts written shortly after Spinoza's death, this book is probably the first extended treatment of Spinoza's life in any language.<br /><br />Given the scarcity of biographical information, Nadler does an excellent job in placing Spinoza's life in historical context. He discusses in detail how the Jewish community in Amsterdam became established, precariously, by immigrants from the Inquisition in Spain and Portugal. He describes the efforts the Jewish community made to win acceptance in Amsterdam, the place of Spinoza's family in the Jewish community, and the rabbis and leaders of the community. Some of this material is well-known, others of it is less so. It is all valuable to getting to understand Spinoza.<br /><br />There is a great deal of discussion of the history of the Dutch republic in Spinoza's time. Nadler's discussion includes both internal affairs (the tension between those who wanted a powerful monarch and those who wanted republican institutions) and the complex foreign wars and shifting alliances of the Netherlands during Spinoza's time. I never could make sense of this material before, but Nadler has discussed it well and in sufficient detail to provide a good background in understanding Spinoza's political ideas.<br /><br />Nadler's book is not itself a philosophical study. But he treats carefully and instructively the origin of Spinoza's works and he summarizes their complex ideas well. He does not limit his discussion to the Ethics. Instead, Nadler spends a great deal of time on the Theological-Political Treatise which he rightly views as a neglected masterpiece complementary to the Ethics. There are also good discussions of Spinoza's unfinished &#34;Hebrew Grammar&#34; and, particularly, of the Epistles, as well as of his other works.<br /><br />Nadler has a good sense of Spinoza's naturalism encompassed be the famous phrase &#34;deus, siva natura&#34;. He gives the reader a good feel for the revolutionary nature of Spinoza's thought and shows how and why Spinoza departed from the traditional religious belief of his day.<br />Nadler is a careful in his use of sources. He tells the reader what evidence from a record both complex and sparse he accepts, what he doubts, and why. When Nadler draws a conclusion that goes beyond the available evidence, he tells the reader that he has done so and why he has done so. This is measured, careful writing about a figure Nadler obviously admires.<br /><br />There is much creative detail in this book as Nadler draws on recent scholarship to cast light on Spinoza and his times. For example, he relies substantially on the report made to the Inquisition of a person who knew Spinoza in Amsterdam. He discusses the Sabatti Zvi incident (a false Jewish Messiah who appealed to many people during Spinoza's lifetime) and Spinoza's possible knowledge of it. The book debunks the myth of Spinoza as a recluse. One of the strongest features of the book is its picture of Spinoza's intellectual circle and of his relationship to many friends.<br />The book doesn't include a critical analysis of Spinoza's thought. Such studies are legion and there still is much to say and learn. Also, the book doesn't discuss the reception and influence of Spinoza through the years. Again, this is beyond the scope of the book. The book is an excellent biography of a seminal figure in Western philosophy.

She is an &#34;autobigraphical&#34; writer, and her novels fall into two groups: 1. the earlier &#34;Ohio&#34; novels which are based on Powell's childhood and adolescence in small-town Ohio in the early 20th Century and 2. the later &#34;New York novels which are heavily satirical and describe Greenwich Village where Powell spent most of her adult life.<br /><br />Powell wrote &#34;Dance Night&#34; in 1930, and it is an early novel in the &#34;Ohio&#34; group. It describes the fictitous small-town of Lamptown, Ohio in the early 20th century. There are gritty pictures of the local bars and saloons and of the railroad men who frequented them. There a pictures of the factories which were the chief employers of both men and the young women. The book focuses on the life of the working class in Lamptown, with their cramped, limited ambitions and opportunities, their rickety homes, and their sexual repressions and liasions. (Books such as this remind me of George Gissing, a Victorian novelist who remains too little known, and who depicted somewhat similar scenes and people in London.)<br /><br />The two primary characters in the novel are Morry Abott a young man on the verge of adulthood and Jen St. Clair, a young girl just beginning adolescence who has been adopted from an orphanage. The book is how they come of age, sexually and emotionally, and how they attempt in their own ways (including their frustrated relationship with each other) to leave Lamptown. Morry, in particular, seems based upon Powell herself (she generally uses male protagonists in her books that I have read) and the frustrations she experienced in the rural midwest and her dream of a life of glamor, freedom, and adventure (sexual and otherwise) in New York.<br /><br />In the novel, Morry lives with his mother who runs a small woman's hat shop, the Bon Ton. The father is a travelling salesman and mostly absent. When he is present, things are very ugly.<br /><br />The title &#34;Dance Night&#34; derives from the chief social activity in Lamptown, the Thursday evening dances. Morry, his mother, and the young factory girls of Lamptown frequent the dances to flirt, dance, and arrange dates and sexual encounters.<br /><br />There is a great deal of emphasis in the book on furtive, repressed sexual encounters between the young men and women of Lamptown. There is always a hope of escape -- then and now -- based primarily on the dream of sexual liberation. The book is also a story of economic change and ambition at the time of the beginning of the Depressions. The book shows the passing of chance and the attempt to make a quick dollar without thought or training.<br /><br />The story is really within the American tradition of the coming of age novel -- of the young man finding himself. The book gives a memorable picture of Lamptown. But it leaves its main character Morry as he departs Lamptown in search of broader horizons and an uncertain future.

There are some familiar narratives, particularly that of Frederick Douglass (who has a volume of his own in the Library of America series) as well as many writings that were new to me.<br /><br />The book includes two writers from the colonial period, a short account by James Gronniosaw and a longer narrative by Olaudiah Equiano. The latter book has a first-hand description of the notorious &#34;middle passage&#34; -- the transatlantic journey by which Africans were transported to a life of bondage in the New World. This book also features accounts of life at sea during the mid-18th century that reminded me of Patrick O'Brian's novels of sea life during the Napoleonic era.<br /><br />The collection includes two narratives by women. Sojourner Truth's narrative, as told to a woman named Olive Gilbert, appeared in 1850. It tells the story of slavery in New York State (where it was not abolished until 1827) and introduces a strong-willed woman who combined abolitionism with strong religious passion and a commitment to woman's rights. Harriet Jacobs's account, &#34;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&#34; was published in 1861. Written in a Victorian style, it still tells the story of the trials of a young woman who resisted her master's advances and hid for seven years in a narrow attic before escaping to freedom.<br /><br />&#34;The Confessions of Nat Turner&#34; became the basis of a controversial novel by William Styron. It is an account recorded by a local attorney, Thomas Gray, of Turner's description, while in jail waiting execution, of the slave rebellion he led in Virginia in 1831. This is a spare account but to me much more impressive than what I remember of Styron's novel.<br /><br />There is a lengthy account by a slave named Henry Bibb written in 1849. This book describes several escapes, and a slave prison of almost unbelievable cruelty in Louisville, Kentucky. I found this perhaps the most riveting narrative in the collection.<br /><br />Jacob Green's narrative appeared in 1864. This is a short tough-minded book by a person who was not afraid to fight back.<br /><br />The narrative by William and Ellen Craft (1860) describes how a husband and wife disguised themselves to make a 1000 mile journey from Georgia to freedom. (Most escapes occurred from the border states. Although easier than an escape from the deep South, escapes from even the border states were extraordinarily difficult.)<br /><br />William Wells Brown, like Douglass, went on to a literary career after his escape from slavery. He was the author of the first published African American novel . His narrative (1847) is short but documents convincingly his escape from slavery in Missouri.<br /><br />This collection will help the reader understand the nature of slavery in the United States from its beginning to its end. The volume is part of the Library of America's admirable attempt to produce uniform series of the best in American literature, thought and history. The narratives of American slaves included in this book amply deserve their place in a series that documents the American experience, both for good and for ill.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanand a slave prison of almost unbelievable cruelty in Louisville, Kentucky.

Like Mendel, Lambert is a brilliant geneticist.  Unlike Mendel, Lambert is a dwarf.<br />The story is a mix of humor and philosophy. Lambert's stature as a dwarf does not effect his high intelligence.  Nor does it dwarf his sexual needs and sexual appetite.  His stature does make it difficult for Lambert to form a lasting sexual attachment, (or any sexual attachment) to a woman.  The frustration and loneliness that human beings are heir to are magnified.  Lambert uses his short stature to stare up women's skirts (with many predictable gags in the book).  He frequents prostitutes and his home is cluttered with the latest x-rated magazines as well as with erudite scientific journals.<br />The story tells of Lambert's efforts to form a relationship with a mousy but leggy librarian, Ms Janet Piercey.  When they meet, Ms. Piercey is single but when the two become involved, she has married.  The relationship is adulterous, and the attendant triangle has a complicated and violent denoument.<br />The characters of Lambert and Piercey are well-developed and interesting.  In addition, the book draws parallels between Lambert's life and that of his distant cousin Mendel, whose personal life was little known to me.  There are also interesting discussions in the book of the classical composer Janacek, who was acquainted with Mendel and whose music is not as well-known in the United States as it might be.  There is a lot of philosophical discussion in the book which is provocative but rather of the off-the-cuff variety.  I found some of it got in the way of the story and the characters.  Still, the book will make the reader think.<br />The book discusses, of course, the nature of human \\"normality\\" (what is the consequence of being a dwarf?), and the power of human sexuality.  For me, the most fascinating questions the book raises are religous in character.  In the first half of the book, we seem to get a philosophy of naturalism which suggests that dwarfism, or the human condition, is not caused or fruitfully understood by the actions and will of a revealed God but is a function itself solely of the chance actions of genes with each other.  In some sense this is a liberating philosophy because it frees Lambert from a sense of guilt and of anger with an allegedly all-powerful being at his condition.<br />As the book progresses, a shift takes place.  There is a discussion of the ethical dilemmas posed by abortion and by eugenics (human genetic engineering) that advances in science have made possible.

Although little known during her lifetime, her reputation has blossomed in recent years. &#34;The Wicked Pavilion&#34; is her next-to-last novel. It was written in 1954 and is set in New York City in the late 1940's.<br /><br />The &#34;Wicked Pavilion&#34; in the novel is the Cafe Julien, on Washington Square in Grenwich Village. It is a haunt for failed artists, lovers, bohemians, mid-towners, and those on the make. The novel centers around three groups of characters: a) a group of three failed artist friends, Dazell, Ben and Maurius and their agents and hangers-on. Much of the story centers upon the apparent death of Marius and the instant celebrity and inflation of his reputation that follows in its wake; b) Rick and Elleanora, on-again off-again lovers who meet and carry on their relationship over the years in the Cafe Julien; c)Elsie and Jerry. Elsie is an elderly woman from a wealthy Boston family who befriends Jerry a struggling model and would -be kept woman who spends a night in a mental institution with prostitutes. The three stories are interrelated, but the plot does not fit together altogether well and is the weakest part of this still excellent novel.<br /><br />The book is biting precise, well-observed satire. The characters in the book, both male and female, are predominantly people who have come to New York from the Midwest in search of adventure, art, success, a new life -- much as Dawn Powell herself did. The dream of New York as a &#34;happy city&#34; remains but it becomes covered in Powell's work with disillusion, failure, and cynicism. The artists lack talent, the lovers lack passion, and everyone is on the make. Still, at the end of the book, the Cafe Julien is torn down and Powell makes us feel how an era is at an end.<br /><br />The book begins with a short chapter, an essay in fact, called &#34;entrance&#34; which sets the stage for the disillusion we see in the course of the book. It also sets out, as satire will do, an ideal which the world the book shows us only parodies. Powell writes&#34;<br /><br />&#34;But there were many who were bewildered by the moral mechanics of the age just as there are those who can never learn a game no matter how long they've been obliged to play it or how many times they've read the rules and paid the forfeits. If this is the way the world is turning around, they say, then by all means let it stop turning, let us get off the cosmic Ferris wheel into space. Allow us the boon of standing still till the vertigo passes, give us a respite to gather together the scraps of what was once us -- the old longings for what? for whom&#34; that give us our wings and the chart for our tomorrows.&#34;<br /><br />This book gives a picture of a New York City that physically is no longer and perhaps always lived as a vision and ideal. The book is sharp, cutting and funny in its picture of what Powell portrays as a fallen reality.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanlusion we see in the course of the book.

Unlike the earlier book, this book consists of a series of essays which are loosely connected by some transitional passages and melded into a book. In spite of its somewhat patchwork character, this book is a good study of Vienna and the influence of its writers, psychologists, and composers on Wittgenstein. A major goal of the book is to place Wittgenstein's thought in the context of European culture and thought rather than seeing him solely within the context of the English (and American) analytical philosophy which he influenced profoundly.<br /><br />Of the twelve chapters in the book, the first six have little to do with an analysis of Wittgenstein's thought. Rather they consist of expositions of certain turn-of-the century Viennese thinkers. Chief of these, and probably the most fascinating figure in the book is Otto Weininger who wrote a book called &#34;Sex and Character&#34; at the age of 23 just before his suicide. Weininger is known as an influence on Wittgenstein. He is also remembered, when he is thought of at all, for his anti-feminism and anti-semitism. Janik attempts to capture something of the complexity of Weininger's thought by placing him in the Kantian tradition and as a practitioner of what Janik terms &#34;critical modernism.&#34;<br /><br />There are also good discussions in the first half of the book of Arnold Schoenberg and, surprisingly to me, Jacques Offenbach. These composers are juxtaposed with Weininger for their critical, deflationary tendency in art and thought. They are presented as challenging the tendencies of turn-of-century Vienna towards an entertainment, theatrical culture -- shades of the present.<br /><br />The second half of the book deals more directly with Wittgenstein. It discusses the thought of the logical positivists, of the philosopher of science Hertz, the satirist Karl Kraus (the focus of the earlier &#34;Wittgenstein's Vienna), Freud, and the Viennese poet Trakl. Here again, Janik does not analyze Wittgenstein's thought in detail. Instead, he takes certain broad themes suggested by Wittgenstein such as the distinction between saying and showing, &#34;the mystical&#34;, the nature of religious experience, and the living of the everyday and shows possible sources of these themes in the thinkers he examines. The material is interesting and valuable, probably more for the light it casts on the thinkers Janik discusses than for the light it casts on Wittgenstein.<br /><br />This is a good, difficult book about an important creative period in the early 20th Century and about an important and difficult 20th Century philosopher.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanet Trakl.  Here again, Janik does not analyze Wittgenstein's thought in detail.

The book does indeed take a historical approach, but its subject is more the nature of American law than its detailed history. Professor Friedman describes how our law has become what it is and the sources of change in the law.<br />The theme of his book is that law follows social and economic changes.  It responds to the needs that people in society assert. At the beginning of the 21st Century, we live in a large, pluralistic, technologicaly complex, impersonal and interdependent country.  We are all dependent upon the actions of other people whom we don't know and don't control to meet even the most basic needs of our daily lives.  The growing complexity and bulk of our laws, in economic relations, family law, criminal law and much else changes in response to social needs and mores.  In addition, there has been a move towards centalization -- for people to look to the Federal government as a source of law and as an aggresive participant in social change and in the satisfaction of needs.<br />Given his basic claim that law follows society, Professor Friedman provides a short, useful, overview of law in the colonial period pointing out how societies were smaller, more homogeneous in terms of culture and religion and more able to use more intimate, so to speak, forms of social control than those available to the current administrative state.  He follows this with a good discussion of law and economics which suggests how and why the focus of tort law has changed from protecting growing business to protecting workers.  A section on family law explores the effect of changing sexual mores, among other matters, on the nature of law.  There is a discussion of the changing nature of race relations and of the role of the modern large welfare state.<br />The book is clearly written.  It is thoughtful and provocative in that Professor Friedman sets out a thesis and proceeds to expound and defend it in his exposition of American law.  His book is not and does not purport to be a full, complete treatment of American legal history. It is possible too that the nature of legal change and the interrelationship between law and social change is more complex and multi-layered than the book takes it to be.

He was appointed by President John Adams in one of the last and most significant acts of his administration.<br />Professor Kent Newmyer has written a comprehensive account of the great Chief Justice's career.  The account is admirably researched and documented, drawing extensively on a new edition of Marshall's papers.  It includes careful analyses of Marshall's leading opinions.  Most importantly, Professor Newmyer gives a thoughtful discussion of Justice Marshall's place on the Court and on the importance of his vision of the United States for our history.<br />The book includes a good discussion of Marshall's role in the Revolutionary War, as a successful lawyer in Virginia, and as a landowner and extensive land speculator. But most of the book consists of a discussion of Marshall's career on the Court, his opinions, and the manner in which he shaped the Court as an institution.<br />While Newmyer admires his subject greatly, I found this a very balanced account.  He allows that Justice Marshall did not always meet his own stated goals of separating law from politics and notes how Marshall's activities as a land speculator seemed to play a critical role in several of his leading opinions.<br />The discussion begins with Marbury v Madison and its role in the doctrine of judicial review. It continues with a thorough discussion of Marshall's role in the treason trial of Aaron Burr, through a discussion of the great opinions construing the Commerce Clause and Contracts Clause of the Constitution, through the Cherokee Nation opinions that Marshall wrote near the end of his tenure which established the foundation of American Indian Law. (Professor Newmyer considers these decisions Justice Marshall's proudest moment.)<br />The book considers Marshall's attitudes towards and opinions dealing with slavery.  There is also a discussion of a series of polemical articles Justice Marshall exchanged with critics following the decision in McCollough v Maryland.  Marshall's critics feared that he was giving too expansive a power to the National Government as opposed to the States.  In fact, at the end of his career, Justice Marshall feared his life work had been overtaken by events with the rise of the democracy, a strong state rights movement, and the Presidency of Andrew Jackson.<br />Professor Newmyer sees Justice Marshall as a Burkean conservative in a new world.  Marshall interpreted the Constitution broadly, yet flexibility to allow the development of individual, and national commerce and enterprise.  Yet he was devoted to institutions and strongly inclined to accept the world as he found it rather than make it over in accordance with abstract principles (as he accused the supporters of the French Revolution of doing.) Newmyer writes:<br />  Marshall spoke as a Burkean conservative, or as much of  one as American circumstances allowed.  He was repelled by reductionist abstractions as well as abstract idealims, even when it was couched, as was much of southern constitutionalism in terms of a mythical past.  He worked from the 'given', accepted the world as it was, relished 'the disorder of experience&quot; to borrow a phrase from Charles Rosen.&quot; (p.351)<br />Justice Marshall was not an original thinker, but he took the text of the Constitution, together with the Federalist, and molded it and the Court's interpretive role in a way that is with us today.  He remains America's great Chief Justice.  There is much for the interested reader to learn and to think through in Professor Newmyer's fine study of Justice Marshall.d with critics following the decision in McCollough v Maryland.

In general, I find it difficult to discuss works of literature which have the Holocaust as a main theme.  Sebald's book is written with understatement, eloquence, feeling and irony.  It is worth reading, but, in my view, significantly overpraised in the reviews I have read.<br />The book tells the story of five \\"emigrants\\" from Germany.  There are four chapters devoted to one of the emigrants each and the narrator, who himself seems homeless and a wanderer in many ways.  Each of the characters is a loner with difficulty coming to terms with himself (all the main characters in this book are men) and his past.  They all have a sad story to tell of exile and loss.  Of the four characters, two commit suicide, one dies in an institution, we leave one as he appears to be on his deathbed.  Only the narrator survives whole at the end.<br />The book is allusive, told through many voices.  The pattern of the stories is that the narrator meets the characters at different points of his life and becomes intrigued by them and seeks out their past.  The stories are tossed from voice-to-voice and from time-to-time.  We have dream sequences, sections by the narrators, sections from diaries or memoirs, and sections by third parties.<br />The stories are woven around a series of grainy black and white photographs which give a sense of realism and place to an account which frequently is evancescent.  I found the use of the photographs effective.<br />In my opinion, the book gives the reader a sense of loss of a high and widely shared European Culture and life of the mind and spirit which is now gone forever.  It was dashed by World War I not to speak of the Holocaust.  There is a dream of a common culture in which Jews and non-Jews participated and shared alike, with each person bringing his or her own gifts to the mixture.  I find this account throughout the book.  The discussions in the book of how the Jews in a particular German synagogue opted to forgo the repair of the synagogue roof in WWI so that the German army could use the copper, the discussion of the old, decaying Jewish synagogue in which the narrator sees the graves of people with the same types of passions and dreams as himself. and the story of the young woman engaged to a non-Jewish musician bring home to me the authors attempt to portray a failed dream of a common culture and its brutal aftermath.<br />This book portrays the unhappy fate of culture in the Twentieth Century.

The book does not engage in hero-worship or myth-making but rather presents Dr. King as a tortured.conflicted, and lonely individual.  Frady writes at the close of his introduction (p.10) (itself a wonderful summation of the book and of Dr. King's achievement): \\"And what the full-bodied reality of King should finally tell us, beyond all the awe and celebration of him, is how mysteriously mixed, in what torturously complicated frms, our moral heroes -- our prophets --actually come to us.\\"<br />A theme of this book is how Dr. King's moral vision and achievement emerged from moral conflict. Dr King spent most of his career walking a difficult path between extremes.  At the beginning of his career, he was criticized by the more conservative black establishment which preferred to use the courts rather than demonstrations as a means to promote racial equality.  Indeed, Frady tells us, the Mongomery bus boycott of 1955, which catapaulted Dr. King into national prominence, did not end the segregation of the city's bus system -- a court decision did.<br />Towards the end of his career, black leaders such as Malcolm X and Stokely Charmichael pressured Dr. King to abandon his philosophy of nonviolence. He did not do so.  But Frady shows us how Dr. King and Malcolm X near the end of their lives each learned something from the other.<br />King's most difficult moral struggle was with himself.  Frady gives us a convincing picture of how Dr. King, whose appeal rested upon an ability to convey moral and religous principle, struggled (unsuccessfully) with sexuality.  A myriad of affairs followed him and his mission from beginning to end.  Frady has insightful things to say about the relationship between Dr. King's tortured, complex personal life and his public mission.<br />Frady also describes how near the end of his career with segregation on the decline in the South, Dr. King tried to expand his mission by opposing the war in Vietnam and by his \\"poor peoples campaign\\" which Dr. King saw as an attack on the materialism, impersonality, and greed that he found pervaded American life. In so expanding his mission, Dr. King alienated many of his followers.  His lasting achievement does not rest upon these later activities, according to Frady, but rather upon the idealism and moral committment with which he was able to infuse American life during a few short years.<br />Frady gives us an eloquent discussion of Dr. King's \\"I have a dream\\" speech in Washington D.C.  Later in his career, Dr King set forth his vision for America by speaking in terms of a \\"Beloved Community\\", a phrase adopted from the early 20th Century American philosopher, Josiah Royce.  Dr King said (p. 183) \\"When I talk about power and the need for power, I'm talking in terms of the need for power to bring about ... the creation of the Beloved Community.\\" Our nation is still trying to recover something of Dr. King's idealism and of the best of his vision.<br />This book encourages us to think about and to formulate for ourselves the vision of America as a \\"Beloved Community\\" by reflecting on the life and achievement of a complex man.bes how near the end of his career with segregation on the decline in the South, Dr. King tried to expand his mission by opposing the war in Vietnam and by his \\"poor peoples campaign\\" which Dr. King saw as an attack on the materialism, impersonality, and greed that he found pervaded American life.

Her focus is on the immigration act of 1965 which allowed for the first time in our history a large immigration to the United States from Asia.  Asian immigrants brought with them their religious traditions, particularly in this book, Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam.  Professor Eck studies the growth of these communities in the United States and explores how they have changed the religious face of our country.<br />The book begins with a short historical overview of religious diversity in the early United States beginning with the intolerance of some of our early settlers through the work of Jefferson and Madison in securing religous liberty.<br />As the United States experienced large waves of immigration in the late 1800, two views of the nature of our country developed.  The first viewed the United States as a \\"melting pot\\" under which the new settlers together with the population already here would blend and form a single, unified nation of shared values.  The second view, developed by sociologist Horace Kallen articulated a vision of pluralism based upon the analogy of a symphony orchestra.  It takes many different instruments to play a single symphony.  Each voice is unique and yet each contributes to one whole.  Professor Eck's sympathies are with the latter view.  I suggest that it might be possible to synthesize these two apparently competing positions.<br />I found the most interesting parts of the book were the central chapters describing in some detail the various Hindu, Buddhist, and Muslim communities in the United States.  Again, I thought the discussion of the history of these groups in our country even more interesting than the discussion of contemporary pluralism.  Each of these groups has a long history in the United States. Their ideas have contributed much to our country even though for many years the number of adherents of these groups has been small. For example,  Emerson and Thoreau showed a great deal of interest in both Buddhism and Hinduism and had valuable things to say about them. In 1893 a world  \\"Parliament of Religions\\" took place in Chicago in which representatives of both Hinduism and Buddhism began to make an impact in the United States. (There was a similar Parliament in 1993.)  Religions outside the Judeo-Christian mainstream have had much to teach for a long time.<br />Professor Eck's discussion of Buddhism focuses on how recent immigrants from various parts of Asia have attempted to keep and develop communal practice in the United States.  I found this interesting in that she focuses on Asian Buddhism in the United States and pays relatively little attention to Westerners who have been attempting to develop an understanding of Buddhism indigenous to our country.<br />There is a revealing discussion as well of the growth of Islam in the United States.  Professor Eck describes the black Islamic movements and describes as well how Islam in the United States has become large, organized, and visible.  The book was written before September 11, and inevitably the reader will have questions about how the events of that day affect her account of American Islam.<br />There is an account in the book of the difficulties the new religions have faced in terms of fear and bigotry from some of their fellow citizens.  There is also a good, more inspiring and positive account, of how people in our country are learing to live and share their various religous traditions.<br />I have become fascinated with the study of comparative religion in part through my own study of Buddhism.  This book discusses the growth of different traditions in the United States.  It may also help those wishing to explore and to better understand themselves.dherents of these groups has been small.

McClellan met the Army of Northern Virgina commanded by Robert E. Lee in the fields near Sharpsburg, Maryland.  The result was the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day in American History and a pivotal moment of the Civil War.  The battle ended the Confederacy's first invasion of the North and gave President Lincoln the opportunity to issue the Emancipation Proclamation.<br />In his short study, &quot;Crossroads of Freedom&quot; Professor McPherson weaves together many strands in discussing the significance of the battle.  First, he places the battle against the backdrop of the prior military course of the war, both in the Eastern and the Western Theatres.  He points out how Union successes in the early part of 1862 were followed by serious defeats in the Seven Days Battle and Second Manassas with the tide of the war turning to the Confederacy. Although the South would again invade the North culminating in the Battle of Gettysberg, Antietam was a clear check to Southern momentum.  It gave the Union the courage, will and political force to fight on.<br />Second, Professor McPherson emphasizes the role of the European powers -- England and France -- in the Civil War.  These nations followed events in America closely and were economically at risk from the loss of Southern cotton for their textile mills. They likely would have recognized the Confederacy if the results of the first invasion of the North had favored the Cofederacy.<br />Third, and probably most importantly to his theme, Professor McPherson discusses the role of Antietam in the changing character of the Civil War.  President Lincoln was opposed to slavery, but his initial war aims did not include freeing the slaves.  Rather he wished to hold the Union together. As the War continued, Lincoln became convinced of the necessity of issuing an Emancipation Procamation but believed that he needed a military success to give the Proclamation force and credibility.  The victory at Antietam, narrow as it was, and tremendous as was its human cost, gave him that opportunity.<br />Emancipation was indeed a new birth of freedom.  It also, as Professor McPherson points out, changed the character of the War from one with the aim of trying to persuade the South to come back to a state of total War -- which changed the character of a culture and redefined the nature of freedom in the United States.<br />Professor McPherson's book is part of a series called &quot;Pivotal Moments in American History&quot; whose aim is &quot;to encourage interest in problems of historical contingency.&quot;  There was a great deal of chance involved in the Battle of Antietam, more so than in most military campaigns. (There were also military blunders on both sides.) During the course of the southern invasion the Union discovered by chance a copy of General Lee's &quot;Special Order No. 179&quot; which had been dropped in a field.  Special Order No. 179 detalied Lee's disposition of his troops and gave General McClellan the opportunity to attack in series each detachment of Lee's divided army.  This was crucial to the result at Antietam.  But McClellan missed the opportuniity to win a decisive victory and bring an end to the War.  Human error and chance play a great role in human events.  But Professor McPherson might have done well to refer to Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address and compared Lincoln's reflections on the role of providence with the blind chance that led to the Union finding of Special Order No. 179.<br />There is only a short description of the battle of Antietam itself. The focus of the study is putting the Battle in its historial and political context rather than in a detailed analysis of military moves.  Nevertheless,  I fouund Professor McPersons's description of the battle (as well as his descriptions of the Seven Days Battle and Second Manassas) easier to follow than more detailed studies I have read.  Professor McPherson gives a good annotated bibliography which refers the reader interested in a military study of the battle to more detailed accounts.<br />This is an excellent study of the Battle of Antietam which places it well in the context of the Civil War and which encourages the reader to reflect on the meaning of the War and of the nature of American freedom.rofessor McPherson gives a good annotated bibliography which refers the reader interested in a military study of the battle to more detailed accounts.<br />This is an excellent study of the Battle of Antietam which places it well in the context of the Civil War and which encourages the reader to reflect on the meaning of the War and of the nature of American freedom.	2002-09-07

He was born a slave on the Eastern Shore in Maryland and grew up on plantations on the Eastern Shore with several years in Baltimore.  He was a physically powerful, highly intelligent, and spirited youth and developed quickly a hatred of the slave system. As a slave, he taught himself to read and write, and learned the art of public speaking from the church and from a book of orations popular at the time that feel into his hands. He escaped from slavery at the age of 20 and moved to New Bedford,Massachusetts.  He became part of the Abolitionist Movement and achieved fame as a public speaker.  He became a newspaper editor and writer.  During the Civil War, he assisted in the recuritment of black troops.  He met President Lincoln on several occasions and became a great admirer.  In later years, Douglass was aligned with the conservative \\"stalwart\\" wing of the Republican party and continued to speak out for the rights of African-Americans, to oppose (somewhat belatedly) the end of Reconstruction, and to work for the life of the spirit and the mind.<br />Frederick Douglass wrote three autobiographies which are given in this volume.  The first, shortest, and best was written in 1845, seven years after Douglass had escaped from slavery.  It tells in graphic and unforgettable terms the story of Douglass' life as a slave, the growth of the spirit of freedom in himself. and the early part of his life as a free man in New Bedford.<br />The second autobiography was written in 1855.  It repeats much of the earlier story and describes Douglass's visit to Great Britain.  A higlight of this volume is the Appendix in which Douglass gives the reader excerpts from several of his speeches, including his perhaps most famous speech \\"What to the Slave is the Fourth of July.\\"<br />Douglass wrote his third autobiography in 1888 and edited it substantially in 1893.  It describes Douglass's relationship with Abraham Lincoln and John Brown.  I also enjoyed the section of the book in which Douglass describes his trip to England, Italy, and Egypt near the end of his life.  It is highly intelligent, perceptive and reflective travel writing.  There are also excerpts in this final autobiography from Douglass's speeches and letters.<br />The most striking incident in all three volumes is Douglass's story of how he stood up for himself and became in his own eyes a man of dignity and courage.  Douglass had been sent for a year to live with a small farmer named Covey who had a reputation for breaking the sprit of strong-willed slaves.  Covey whipped Douglass unmercifully for the first six months.  Then, after a whipping which left Douglass scared and weak for several days (he ran back to his old master who ordered him back to Covey) Douglass fought back.  Covey attempted to whip Douglass and Douglass resisted.  The two men fought hand-to-hand for hours.  Douglass could not assume the offensive in the fight (it was enough to resist at all) but more than held his ground and had the better of it.  Covey at last walked off and never whipped Douglass again.  This incident is strikingly told in each autobiography and marks the moment when Douglass showed he could stand up for himself and not have the spirit of a slave.  It is inspiring and it grounded his actions for the rest of his life.<br />There is much in these books that transcends the resistance against American slavery, utterly important as that is.  We have, as I have tried to explain, in this book the voice of personal freedom and self-determination which is something every person must learn and undestand for him or herself in deciding how to live.  In addition,I get the impression that as Douglass aged he became increasingly committed to the life of the mind and the spirit.  This is apparent from his writing and from his interest in travel, in European high culture, art, literature, and music.  Douglass learned the meaning for freedom.  He tried to devote himself to matters of the spirit in addition to his lifelong quest to improve the lot of the former slave.  I think there is still a great deal to be learned here.<br />Douglass had much to say about the nature of American freedom and democracy.  He loved and had faith in them, in spite of the horrible stain of slavery.  Here is a wonderful observation from the third autobiography in which Douglass' describes his activities during the Presidential campaign of 1888.<br />\\"I left the discussion of the tariff to my young friend Morris, while I spoke for justice and humanity....I took it to be the vital and animating principle of the Republican party.  I found the people more courageous than their party leaders.  What the leaders were afraid to teach, the people were brave enough and glad enough to learn.  I held that the soul of the nation was in this question, and that the gain of all the gold in the world would not compensate for the loss of the nation's soul.  National honor is the soul of the nation, and when this is lost all is lost. ... As with an individual, so too with a nation, there is a time when it may properly be asked \\"What doth it profit to gain the whole world and therby lose one's soul?\\"<br />There is a spirit and a wisdom in Douglass that still has much to teach.<br />As a man of the Nineteenth Century, Douglass tells us little in his autobiographies of his personal life.  Upon his escape from slavery, Douglass married a free, uneducated black woman.  Upon her death, Douglass married a white woman, which (as we see briefly in the book) caused shock among American whites and blacks alike.  We also see little of Douglass' relationship to his children.  The reader who would like to learn more about Douglass' personal life needs to read a biography, such as William McFeeley's \\"Frederick Douglass\\" (1891)<br />Douglass' autobiographies are are precious work of American literature and a testimony to the free human spirit.ned the meaning for freedom.

The Samannaphala Sutta is part of the \\"Long Discourses of the Buddha\\" of the Pali Canon, the oldest series of buddhist texts.  In addition to the translation by Bhikkhu Bodhi, the Sutta may be found in the translation of the entire \\"Long Discourses of the Buddha\\"  by Maurice Walshe.<br />For the past several years, I have had the good fortune to participate in a Sutta Study Group in which we study the Pali texts. Recently, we devoted three sessions to study of the Samannaphala Sutta using both Walshe's and Bhikkhu Bodhi's translation.  We proceeded by reading the Sutta aloud, in small sections, and then pausing for group discussion and comments.  The members of our group take turns in leading the discussions. I was favored with the opportunity to lead the discussion of this complex and profound text.<br />The Samannaphala Sutta tells the story of an encounter beteen King Ajasattu and the Buddha.  With all his power and wealth, and 500 wives, the King feels something is missing in his life.  (Indeed, the King is understandably troubled because he has just killed his father to assume the throne.)  He goes to the Buddha, and other ancient teachers, in search for peace of mind and for an understanding of the benefits of what Ayya Khema's book characterizes as a 'Spiritual\\" way of life.<br />The Buddha explains the Buddhist ethical path to the King and further develops 14 fruits of the spiritual life.  These fruits begin with the most mundane consideration of benefits of the life of the seeker and end with the attainment of the highest, most rarified wisdom. Each of the fruits is illustrated by metaphors of increasing power.  The Sutta ends with King Ajasattu becoming a lay follower of the Buddha.  The suggestion is that the King cannot proceed further than this due to the grave evil he has committed in murdering his father.<br />It is a great value of this book that it presents this ancient Sutta in a form accessible to many readers.<br />Following the Sutta, the remainder of the book consists of a lengthy commentary by Ayya Khema.  Although this is not explicitly stated, the commentary appears derived from a series of lectures, as witnessed by the questions and answers at the end of several of the chapters.  Her commentary is not a line-by-line exposition of the Sutta.  Bhikku Bodhi, in his translation of the Sutta, offered as well a selection of commentaries from Pali sources which discuss the text in great detail.  This is not the only way, or possibly even the best way, for a modern reader to approach this Sutta.  It does have the advantage, however, of forcing the reader to pay close attention to the text itself.<br />Although Ayya Khema's commentary has many interesting and valuable things  to teach, it strays rather far from the text of the Samannaphala Sutta.  After the opening in which she nicely sets the stage by discussing the encounter between the King and the Buddha, she wanders further and further from the text of the discourse.  In many cases, she elaborates upon its teachings well.  Much of the time, I thought the reader would be better served by looking more closely at the text and at the literary structure of the Sutta.  After the beginning few pages, the commentary loses sight of the dramatic form of the Sutta.  It also, in its free-wheeling character loses the opportunity to comment on the metaphors by which the Buddha explains his teachings to the King.  These metaphors are revealing and are basically unique to this Sutta.<br />There is little discussion in the commentary of textual issues going to the meaning of the Sutta.  There are places where such a discussion would have been useful.  Most basically, I am not comfortable with the translation of the Sutta as a discourse on the fruits of a \\"Spiritual\\" life.  To me this is too broad and too vague.  There is much to be said for Bhikku Bodhi's translation of the title -- the fruits  of \\"Recluseship\\" or for Walshe's -- the fruits of the \\"homeless\\" life.  The word \\"Spiritual\\" does not indicate, to me the radical character of the life at issue.<br />In some instances, the fruits of the spiritual life that are described in the commentary do not appear in the Sutta.  The commentary describes the higher Jhanas, for example, as a fruit of the Spiritual life.  (Jhana's are progressively more rarified meditative states.)  While the Sutta does describe the first four Jhanas, it does not even mention the fifth through eighth Jhanas which Ayya Khema in her commentary describes as a fruit of spirituality in the Sutta.  Conversely, much of the Sutta is given to a description of certain supernatural states.  This book's commentary passes over these states in silence.  Although I agree that these suprernatural descriptions are difficult to understand for the contemporary reader, it would be better, I think to acknowledge them as part of the text rather than to simply ignore them.  While the commentary very properly emphasizes egolessness and nonself as fundamental to the Buddha's teaching in this Sutta, there are portions of the discussion in the commentary which seem to speak of a universal consciousness which all people share.  I do not think I find such a teaching in the Buddha or in this Sutta.<br />The reader would be well -served, I think, by using the commentary as a springboard to read and reread the Sutta itself.  There are many books on Buddhism and its teachings currently available, but there is surprisingly little attention paid to the original texts.  This book should ideally provide an opportunity to the reader to study the text of an important Buddhist teaching, the Samannaphala Sutta, for him or herself.

He wrote about the life of blacks during the reconstruction era and during slavery.  He also wrote about turn-of-the century relationships between black people and white people and about the emerging black urban middle-class and its relationship to both poor rural black people and to educated white people.<br />Chestnutt wrote two volumes of stories, &quot;The Conjure Woman&quot; (1899) and &quot;The Wife of his Youth and other Stories of the Color Line&quot; (1899).  This short, inexpensive book from the Dover Thrift series includes stories from each volume together with a useful introduction to Chestnutt by Joan Sherman.<br />There are five &quot;Conjure Woman&quot; stories in the brief volume.  These stories take place in North Carolina just after the Civil War and they relate back to events and characters in the pre-Civil War period. The stories are told in a heavy dialect which takes some getting used to.  The characters are a white Northern couple, John and Annie, who have moved to North Carolina, an aging black storyteller and former slave named Uncle Julius, and a &quot;conjure woman&quot; named Aunt Peggy. At critical moments during their stay in North Carolina, Uncle Julius tells John and Annie stories about the conjure woman which illuminate life in the slave South and which have a way of returning back to John and Annie as well.  The stories are fun, creative, and outrageous.<br />The second group of five stories explore white black relationships subsequent to the Civil War as well as relationships between different types of black people.  There are three stories which deal with highly educated black people and the ambivalence they feel towards the rural blacks in the post-Reconstruction south. These stories also show the difficulties faced by urban black people in the North at the turn-of-the century in gaining acceptance from their neighboors.  (Chestnutt had first-hand experience of this situation.) There is also a story centering upon a lynching in a Sourthern town.<br />This is a short, inexpensive book which will introduce the reader to an early African-American writer who deserves to be better known.hestnutt had first-hand experience of this situation.)

The book is not limited to novelists but includes considerations of poets, essayists, philosophers, and Presidents as well.  The book begins with the Puritan period of Jonathan Edwards and Anne Bradstreet and concludes with a glance at Thomas Pynchon and John Updike. There are chapters on Hawthorne, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Melville Whitman, Lincoln, Dickinson, William James, Mark Twain, T.S. Elliot, Frost, and Faulkner.<br />Although the book describes many American approaches to religion, it is not until near its end that Kazin offers something of a definition of what he thinks the search is about.  Kazin writes (p. 236) &quot;I think of religion as the most intimate expression of the human heart, as the most secret of personal confessions, where we admit to ourselves alone our fears and our losses, our sense of holy dread and our awe before the unflagging power of a universe that regards us as indeed of 'no account'&quot;.  It is not surprising, given both the nature of his subject matter and Kazin's own understanding of it, that the book invites us to see religion in personal, noninstitutional terms.  We are also warned away (see p. 141) from an &quot;American Civil Religion&quot; in which Americans worship their own culture and history as evidenced by a smug materialism.<br />There is a great emphasis in the book, as there should be, on slavery, the Civil War and continuing issues of race in America.  Here Kazin gives Abraham Lincoln the strongest word,  as a leader, a writer, and a religious thinker.  Lincoln was a nonchurchgoer and was not religious in any traditional sense.  He indeed exemplified a theme that appears to run through this book -- that in the United States people are encouraged to find religion and meaning for themselves outside the bounds of formal creed.  Yet, in the Second Inaugural Address, Lincoln gave us a profound meditiation both on Divine Justice and on Divine Inscrutability and on the related, even though conflicting, themes of retribution and forgiveness.<br />Most of the book covers familar authors and familiar books.  I enjoyed in particular reading Kazin's discussion of Melville because it focuses on Melville's little-known epic poem Clarel. This poem is based on Melville's own trip to what was then Palestine and it explores Melville's tortured thought on the relationship between religion and secularism.<br />This book is a valuable study both of American literature and American religious thought with an emphasis on the effect of freedom and secularism on the nature of religion in the United States.  It may encourage the reader to explore, or to think about anew, the nature of American literature and to rethink for him or herself the nature of religious ideals and practices.a profound meditiation both on Divine Justice and on Divine Inscrutability and on the related, even though conflicting, themes of retribution and forgiveness.<br />Most of the book covers familar authors and familiar books.

US	48185764	R2SE809OY207EE	0062517007	175708639	One Dharma: The Emerging Western Buddhism	Books	4	67	73	N	N	The Dharma of Freedom	Joseph Goldstein has written an ambitious, short book which attempts to synthesize the wisdom and teachings of various Buddhist traditions and which offers thoughts on the possible future couse of Buddhism in the West.  The book is also a practitioner's guide and a manual for those setting out on a Buddhist practice.<br />Each of the components of this book is difficult and important.  Joseph Goldstein has valuable things to teach and suggest to the reader about the many questions raised in the book. But I found that the book had a certain lack of focus from trying to do too many things in too brief a compass.<br />Specifically, Mr. Goldstein's discussion of meditation practice and of Buddhist moraliity was very well put. It cannot be heard often enough, particularly for those readers new to Buddhism. But the discussion of meditation practice, for me, was not well integrated with the other themes of the book -- an attempt to show what various Buddhist teachings prevalent in the United States have in common and to show how Buddhism may develop in the United States.<br />The book opens with an eloquent discussion of the growing interest by many people of Buddhism in the United States.  It discusses as well the three traditions which probably have received most attention in the West: Theravada, Zen, and Tibetan Buddhism, although Mr. Goldstein is fully aware that there are other traditions as well. With the transmission of the Dharma to the United States, Mr. Goldstein asks what these traditions have in common and how the Westerner is to learn to practice.  He offers many stories from his own experience, beginning with his practice in Theravada Buddhism which gradually expanded to an interest in Zen and Tibetan Buddhism.  There is an all-to-brief history of Buddhism and its divisions into the Theravada and Mahayana schools.  For all the goood things Mr. Goldstein has to say about practice, I would have liked to have heard more about this given the theme of the book.<br />Mr. Goldstein stresses the pragmatic character of the Buddha's teaching with its encompassing purpose of ending suffering.  He rightly emphasizes, I think, that this purpose is common to all Buddhist traditions and he suggests as well that practitioners can draw on one or the other of the traditions given their own spiritual needs and progress.  In a brief compass, he also contrasts various traditions as being \\"top-down\\" on the one hand, emphasizing the pure, radiant character of the mind, or \\"bottom-up\\" on the other hand, as in the Theravada tradition, emphasizing the hold of the passions and the fetters and the need to work to purify the mind.  Again, I would have liked a fuller treatment of these themes and perhaps less an emphasis on meditation technique.  There are many books available which address the latter.<br />Mr Goldstein emphasizes, rightly, a famous verse from the Dhamamapada,(verse 183) a compilation of verses from the Theravada canon.  The verse is<br />\\"Not to do any evil; to cultivate good, to purify one's mind -- this is the Teaching of the Buddhas.\\"<br />This verse does indeed sum up the Buddha's teaching in all the schools.  Much of Mr. Goldstein's book is a commentary on the verse.  But I still was left with the feeling that a more detailed presentation was required to understand Buddhism in the United States.<br />As the book progresses with the treatments of nonclinging, selfnesses, and Nirvana, the differences in the various traditions becomes clear and the book assumes a better focus.  There is a good attempt to show in the conclusion of the book how the various traditions of Buddhism are all paths leading to one goal -- the cessation of suffering through the attainment of wisdom. The United States offers the unique possibility of the realization of a \\"Dharma of Freedom.\\", Mr Goldstein tells us at the end of the book.  It will not be tied to particular schoools or debates but rather will offer the hope of freedom from suffering and fromclinging for those who choose to enter the path.<br />\\"One Dharma\\" is one of the few books that woould be better if it were longer.  Too much is left out for the reader to see how the traditions of Buddhism, if only on the surface, differ from each other and how the transmission of Buddhism to the United States promises the opportunity of integrating teachings from the different schools.clinging for those who choose to enter the path.<br />\\"One Dharma\\" is one of the few books that woould be better if it were longer.

Its hero is Rebecca Davitch, a 53 year-old widow and grandmother.  She rents portions of the row house, which is known as the \\"Open Arms\\" out for large parties and catered affairs, a business she inherited from her husband and operates with his relatives.  As we meet Rebecca, she is dissatisfied with the apparent clutter and confusion of her life as one of her stepdaughters prepares to be married.  The reader embarks with Rebecca on her voyage of self-discovery, where she is, where she has been, where she wants to be.  Perhaps it is important that the adjacent rowhouse to the Open Arms happens to be a meditation center.<br />We learn in the novel that Rebecca dumped her college and high school sweetheart, Will, and dropped out of college to marry Joe Davitch, 13 years her senior and the proprietor of the Open Arms. At the time of the marriage, Joe had three young daughters from a failed earlier marriage.  Joe and Rebecca have a daughter of their own before Joe's untimely death leaves Rebecca to raise the three step-daughters and her own daughter.<br />We see the bric-a-brac of life in this book in the old rowhouse and in the family which is Rebecca's.  Each of the grown daughters and their (sometimes multiple) spouses or partners is highly eccentric, from their nicknames to their characters.  The children are as well.  The Davitch's are indeed blended in that the family and their spouses and others represent a variety of races, ethnic groups, religons, level of education, interests, what have you.  They are an interesting but confusing group and their various peculiarities made the story difficult to follow for me at times.<br />When we meet Rebecca, she is harried by the everydayness of her life.  She remembers Will, the young man she dumped in college in favor of Joe, and is bothered by the possiblity that she made the wrong choice.  Much of the book describes how Rebecca makes contact with Will again.  In one of the best, because one of the simplest and most obviously felt passages of the book, Will tells Rebecca upon their first new meeting  that \\"you broke my heart.\\"  By finding Will again, and trying to see if a relationship with him is possible in mid-life, Rebecca comes to terms with her life.<br />There is the touch of family in this book with its estrangements, its clutter, its loves, and its daily tasks.  Rebecca questions at times whether there is more to life.  Her college hero was Robert E. Lee whom she sees, both in her college days and when we meet her, as a heroic figure (very properly so) who tried to act beyond the chores and trials of everyday to make a principled decision to stand with the South.  Robert E. Lee is something of a foil to the actions in the book, (as is, in a different way, the meditation center next door.)<br />The book is effective as a whole because Anne Tyler has a light, deft touch and doesn't take herself too seriously.  The book is funny and generally reads well. Unfortunately the book (and virtually every character) is far too mannered.  The mannerisms and eccentriciteis pale quickly and they mask a certain sameness and triteness in the story.  There is too much attention paid to the quirkiness of each character.  This distracts from the story to me and makes Rebecca's search shallower than it should be.  It adds undue sentimenality to the book, and it is cloying.<br />Part of what I get from the book is that life is lived in moments and we need to cherish and understand the everyday.  The sentimentality, the peeling plaster and spasmodic electricity in the rowhouse, the adventures and misadventures of Rebecca, her children and grandchildren all have a touch of the down-to-earth. It is not the sort of spiritual journey in which the protagonist seeks solitude or some innder source of wisdom.

He has written an excellent if difficult book offering the insights of a performer into Beethoven's great music.<br /><br />Taub's book will inevitably be compared with Charles Rosen's recent study \\"Beethoven's Piano Sonatas: A Short Companion.\\"  The books share many insights but are written from different perspectives.  Rosen's work is broader and more historical in scope.  Taub's book is the work of a concert pianist and it reflects, in sometimes a personal way, on how he learned the sonatas, how he interprets each of these remarkably individual works, and how he performs them.  There is a great deal of detail on the technique of piano playing as applied to each sonata.  We learn how Taub chooses his tempo, how he pedals,  how he voices and emphasizes the notes in a chord,  the decisions he makes in phrasing and in holding his fingers.  We learn when and why he slows down and emphasizes a passage and when and why he strives to play a passage brilliantly.It is a work by a pianist which seems to me to be primarily for other pianists. although much that he says will be of interest to music listeners as well.<br /><br />In learning and performing a complex work of music such as a Beethoven sonata, Taub tells us, a performer makes an implied moral contract with the composer.  The contract requires the performer to delve into the music and to internalize it in order to understand what the composer wished to express.  The performer effectively promises the composer to bring the music to life so that the audience may understand and be moved by the work -- so that the hearer may respond to and carry the music with him or her.  For Taub the moral contract between performer and composer requires careful study of the score and -- particularly in the case of Beethoven -- a study of various editions of a particular work and of Beethoven's sketches, authographs, musical markings, and letters that cast light on how he conceived the work.  The performer works with the composers intentions, for the work in its entirety as well as in part, to try to bring something of the power of the music to life.  The music itself is inexhaustable and cannot be encompassed in any single performance or interpretation.<br /><br />Instead of the traditional three-fold division of Beethoven's music, Taub offers a five-fold division of the sonatas.  (Rosen offers a five-fold division as well but, interestingly it differs from Taub's)  Taub's division of the sonatas is as follows:  a). early classical, including the sonatas from opus 2 through opus 22 as well as the two sonatas of opus 49 (13 works); b). seven \\"experimental\\" sonatas, including opus 26 through the three works of opus 31;  c) the three \\"post-Heilgenstadt\\" sonatas, opus 54, 54, 57; d) the three \\"compressed\\" sonatas, opus 78, 79, and 81a; and e) the final \\"transcendent\\" sonatas, opus 90, 101. 106, 109, 110, 111.<br /><br />Following a discussion of general musical principles applicable to all the sonatas, Taub describes how he arranged them for performance of the cycle.  This is probably the single most interesting part of the book.  Taub decided against playing the sonatas simply by following the opus numbers but tried to arrange them thematically.  I learned a great deal about Beethoven's sonatas simply from Taub's discussion of how he ordered them and from his discussion of how he chose the works he did for each individual program.<br /><br />Taub's discussions of each individual sonata, in his nine programs, constitute the heart of the book.  The discussions show, indeed, how Taubhas thought of and internalized this music in trying to share it with his public.  The discussion is fascinating as well in teaching how a performer works and learns.  For those who attempt to play this music, as I do, there is a great deal to be learned from Taub's love for this music, his patience and his attention to musical detail.  As Rosen did in his book, Taub spends a great deal of time in discussing Beethoven's opus 54 sonata (which lies between the Waldstein and Appassionata sonatas) and which is little performed. But I feel that Taub's heart is mostly with the final \\"transcendental\\" sonatas -- opus 90, (which Taub I think properly groups with the last 5 even though this is not usually done) opus 101, opus 106 (the Hammerklavier), 109.110 and 111.  There are some interesting details in the book -- we learn that Taub spent 8 years working on the Hammerklavier before venturing a public performance -- and that Benny Goodman once told Taub after a private performance of the Waldstein sonata that a performer who really wanted to play a work such as the Waldstein had to \\"make it his own\\".  Wise advice and the reference to Benny Goodman makes it special.<br /><br />This is a detailed, pianistic book on some of the greatest music ever composed.ic in trying to share it with his public.

They are music of Beethoven's lifetime in that their composition spans the period from his early days in Vienna to near the end of his life.  In another sense, Beethoven's piano sonatas are the music of my lifetime.  I first was exposed to them as an early adolescent through concerts, records, and my own early attempts at playing the easier of them.  Today, all too many years later (I am 55), I still try to play the sonatas and I go to recitals. I listen to them on CDs now instead of records.  And I read about them, particularly Charles' Rosen's edudite and eloquent study.  With short periods away, Beethoven's piano sonatas are probably the most lasting interest I have had in my life.<br />Rosen was inspired to write this book by giving a performance of the sonata cycle and to lecture on Beethoven at a summer music festival and school.  The book is, on one level, a continuation of Rosen's study, &quot;The Classical Style&quot; with application to the Beethoven sonatas.  The book is marked by its wide-ranging references.  There is a great deal of specific discussion of Beethoven's piano sonatas, of course, but the book is enriched immeasurably by examples from and discussions Mozart, Haydn, and Schubert, as their works are compared and contrasted with Beethoven's.<br />The book is divided into two Parts.  Part I, &quot;The Tradition&quot; begins with a discussion of the nature and development of the sonata form. Rosen describes well how Beethoven's sonatas have, until very recent years, been a bridge from the world of performance of classical music in the home to its appreciation in the concert hall.  This was certainly the case with me.<br />The book discusses various ways in which the sonatas have been interpreted over the years and attempts to find that elusive quarry -- the manner in which the composer would have interpreted the sonatas. Rosen devotes a great deal of attention to questions of tempo and questions of phrasing, with examples from Beethoven's predecessors.  He concludes that modern performers place more emphasis on a smooth legato style than would have been the case in Beethoven's day and that Beethoven's tempos would be somewhat different from those at which we now hear the music.  In some cases, tempos would have been faster, but I get the impression that in the main tempos were taken at a slower pace.  The book comes with a CD recorded by Guiilio Caesare Ricci which illustrates helpfully many of Rosen's musical examples.  Rosen stresses that there is no single way of performing these complex, wonderful pieces of music.  His discussion of performance practices still is highly useful in understanding the sonatas and in listening to them.<br />The second part of the book consists of a chronological discussion of each of the 32 sonatas.  The discussion is arranged in five parts: a)the early 18th Century sonatas (the sonatas from opus 2 to opus 22); b) the sonatas of Beethoven growing in popularity and independent style (the sonatas from opus 26 to opus 28) c) the sonatas in which Beethoven attained mastery (the sonatas from opus 31 through opus 81a) d). the sonatas composed during Beethoven's years of stress and personal difficulty (the opus 90 and opus 101 sonatas and the &quot;Hammerklavier&quot; sonata, opus 106 ); and e)the last sonatas (opus 109. 110,111)<br />In each instance Rosen offers some general comments on the character of each sonata followed by detailed thematic, harmonic and pianistic discussions.<br />I found it useful in this section of the book to read first Rosen's discussion of the sonatas with which I was most familiar, either by attempting to play them or by repeated hearings over the years.  Thus I began with Rosen's discussion of the opus 26 sonata and followed it the the &quot;Waldstein&quot;, the &quot;Pathetique&quot; and the opus 90 sonata.  I then went through Rosen's discussion work by work as it appeared in thebook.  There is much to be learned, and Rosen's discussion will be useful in listening to the sonatas and following along with the score or with Rosen's discussion.<br />It is worth noting that Rosen spends a great deal of time on sonatas which are relatively little performed, particularly the opus 54 (which is given in full on the CD that comes with the book) and with the opus 31 no. 1 sonata.  His discussion of these work illuminates them and illuminates Beethoven's output.  He also gives thorough discussions of more familiar works particularly the &quot;Moonlight&quot; sonata and the Hammerklavier -- with respect to the latter, he follows-up upon the lengthy analysis of this work in The Classical Style.<br />Beethoven's piano sonatas are indeed music of a lifetime.  If you love them, by playing or by hearing them, you will love this book.  If you want to learn about them, this book will be an outstanding guide.book.

His life became the stuff of legend.  Hart Crane left an unhappy home at the age of 17 to live in New York City and follow his dream to become a poet.  Without any formal education -- he did not finish high school -- he used his inborn gifts and wide reading to quickly become important to New York's literary culture and community.  His first book, White Buildings, is a collection of short, difficult imagistic poetry.  His second book, The Bridge, is a lengthy poem offering a mystic, highly personal account of America, its past and its future, using the Brooklyn Bridge is its chief symbol.<br />Crane's life was one of excess.  From late adolesence, Crane drank heavily.  He spent a great deal of time in underworld sex picking up sailors in the harbors of New York, all the while trying to conceal his sexual identity from his parents.  Towards the end of his life, his behavior grew increasingly violent and self-destructive.  He was jailed on several occasions in New York, Paris, and Mexico.  Near the end, he did have what seems to be his only heterosexual relationship with Peggy Cowley, the divorced wife of the critic and publisher, Malcolm Cowley.  Crane committed suicide when he returned with Peggy Cowley from Mexico in 1932 by jumping off the deck of a ship.  He was all of 32.<br />Published in 1999, Mariani's biography commenmorates the Centennial of Crane's birth.  It gives a good detailed account Crane's life.  The poetic focus of the book is The Bridge. (some critics see White Buildings as the stronger, more representative part of Crane's work.) Mariani shows  how Crane conceived the idea of his long poem and how he worked on it fitfully over many years.  He also shows the difficulty Crane had in completing the work at all -- given his alcoholism. sexual promiscuity, difficulty in supporting himself, and bad relationship with his separated parents.  But complete the work Crane did.  It presents a mythic, multi-formed vision of the United States stretching from the Indians to our day of technology.  There is much to be gained from this poem.  I have loved it for many years and Mariani's discussion of the poem and its lenghty creation is illuminating.<br />Crane was a romantic in his life and art.  Frequently, Mariani refers to him as the \\"last romantic\\", but this is an overstatement.  I was reminded both by Crane's dissolute life and by his work of the beats -- particularly of Kerouac -- and the vision of America that they tried to articulate. With a Whitman-type vision of a mystical America encompassing all, the beats share and expand upon the romanticism of Hart Crane.<br />Mariani's book covers well Crane's tortured relationship with his parents.  It includes great discussions of literary New York City and of Crane's friends.  It shows well how Crane was captivated by New York.  We see Crane going back and forth between Clevland, New York, Paris, Mexico and Hollywood in a short overreaching life.  But most importantly, we see the creation and legacy of a poet.  Mariani does well in describing the poems and in reading these difficult texts in conjunction with the poet's life and thought.<br />Crane's literary output was not extensive.  Several of his poems are part of the treasures of American literature.  These poems include, for me, \\"Voyages\\" (a six-part love poem from the White Buildings collection), \\"At Melville's Tomb\\" and other lyrics from White Buildings, The Broken Tower, Crane's final poem, and, of course The Bridge.<br />Mariani gives a good account of Crane.

Her novel \\"The Professor's House\\" is much less familiar, but it is Cather at her best.<br /><br />The book tells the story of Professor Godfrey St. Peter.  When we meet St. Peter, he is a respected academic and scholar, age 52, who has written an eight volume history called \\"Spanish Explorers\\" dealing with the Spanish in Mexico and the American Southwest.  He has persevered in his writing and received awards.  As a result, St. Peter and his family are able to build a new house and move away from the ramshakle rented quarters in which the Professor and his wife have lived and raised their family.<br /><br />The family consists of two daughters who, when we meet them, have married and gone their own ways.  The younger daughter is married to a struggling news reporter who has impressed his bosses by his ability to turn out hack prose-poems for the paper on a daily basis.<br /><br />The older daughter was at one time engaged to a man named Tom Outland who is, perhaps the real hero of the book.  Outland invented an important scientific device and willed it to her upon his death in WW I.  She then marries an engineer and entrepreneur who develops and markets Outland's invention.  The couple build a large home and name in \\"Outland\\".<br /><br />The book tells a story of change, frustration and acceptance.  The Professor is unhappy with the new home and refuses to leave his old study.  His relationship with his wife and daughters has cooled.  He is unhappy with the modernization of the university and of academic learning with its emphasis on technology and business rather than study and reflection.  Most importantly, he is dissatisfied with his honors, his leisure, and his comforts.  He thinks of his youth of promise and study, of his life of solitude, and yearns for adventure and meaning.<br /><br />The first part of the book tells the story of the Professor and his family.  The second, shorter, part is a flash-back and tells the story of Tom Outland who Professor St. Peter befriended many years before and who grew up in mysterious circumstances in New Mexico.  We learn in the second part of the book of Outland's life on the railroad and on the range.  We see his somewhat ambiguous friendship with an older man and their discovery of an ancient Indian village on the mesas.  There is a wonderfully drawn picture of Washington D.C. as Tom tries, without success, to interest officials in his discovery.<br /><br />In the third part of the book, the Professor reflects on Tom and on his own life.  It seems to me that Tom's life mirrors the theme of the Professor's lenghty studies in \\"Spanish Explorers\\" It is the kind of life in its rawness, closeness to nature, and independence that the Professor thinks he would have liked to lead rather than settling for a middle-class life of conformity, comfort, and boredom.  We see how the Professor tries to struggle on.<br /><br />There is a frustration built into life when we learn we are not the persons we dreamed of becoming.  This is a poignant, beautifully-written story of American life and of how and why people fall short of themselves.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanpart is a flash-back and tells the story of Tom Outland who Professor St. Peter befriended many years before and who grew up in mysterious circumstances in New Mexico.

During the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln looked back to it to define the significance of the conflict and to restate the ideals and aspirations of our country.<br />Gordon Wood has written a succinct summary of the Revolution which will give the reader a good overview of the event. The book will allow the reader to think through for him or herself the meaning of our Revolution and to explore further through additional reading and thinking. The book has a good bibliography.<br />In the short compass of the book, Wood offers his own interpretation of the importance of the Revolution.  It was the source of what he calls &quot;middling democracy&quot;.  By this phrase, Wood means that any person, regardless of social status, wealth or education had the right to pursue his or her own ends, to find value, and to seek his or her own self-defined interests and economic success.  The Revolution broke the hierarchical structures of Europe.  We are still, for Wood, living through and developing the insights and consequences of the Revolution.<br />For me, the most interesting section of the book was the discussion of the French-Indian War and how it lead Great Britain to place an army on the frontier and to impose certain taxes to pay its cost.  From these small beginnings, a Revolution grew.  Wood presents a good summary of the causes of the Revolution -- a topic difficult and fascinating in itself.<br />Wood briefly discusses the Revolutionary War, and spends somewhat more space discussing the Articles of the Confederation and the experiments of the various states with constitutionalism and independence.  Wood has explored this ground before in his longer books, particularly his &quot;The Radicalism of the American Revolution&quot; and it is pivotal to his understanding of the formation of American democracy.<br />Finally Wood discusses the Constitutional Convention and the Federalist Anti-Federalist debate over the ratification of the Constitution.  He discusses the significance of the Constitution as a written document (unlike the unwritten Constitution of England) and he suggests how the Constitution led, in a short time and in spite of the Framer's intentions, to the robust &quot;middling democracy&quot; that is the theme of his book.<br />The American Revolution was not one event, but several.

Although his works were quickly translated into English, they were little read in the United States. Fortunately for interested readers, many of his books are now in print again and accessible, including his 1949 novel, &quot;The Woman of Rome&quot;.<br /><br />The book tells the story of Adriana, a beautiful, poor, and uneducated young woman who begins as an artist's model at the age of 16. Although she dreams of a quiet, modest home with a loving husband and children, she becomes both a prostitute and a thief. As a prostitute, she is involved with a number of men with competing ideologies and interests including Astarita, a Fascist chief of police, Giacomo, a student revolutionary against the Fascists and Sozmogo, a criminal and a thug.<br />The story is told in the first person. Adriana is always on stage and the character of highest interest. The reader gets to know her well. The book is told in a linear, easy-to-follow style which builds to a large crescendo at the end of the first part. The second part of the book loses slightly in dramatic intensity and in construction.<br /><br />As with any work of depth, this book functions on a number of levels which reject easy paraphrase or simple meaning. Many readers see the book as a picture of corruption in Rome while others see it more as the story of Adriana. I am more inclined to the second view. As far as I can tell, however, there is a strong spiritual theme in the book which sometimes gets too little emphasis in the pull of conflicting readings.<br /><br />There are no less than four pivotal scenes in The Woman of Rome set in a church. Although the book is replete with sex, violence and raw brutality, it is also highly internalized. Many of its most effective moments are those in which Adriana reflects (in church or out) on her life and on the course it has taken.<br /><br />The German philosopher Frederich Nietzsche (Adriana does not mention and would not have known of him) used the phrase &quot;amor fati&quot; to describe the wise person's attitude towards life. The phrase means loving one's destiny or, to use another related Nietzschean phrase, &quot;becoming who one is&quot;. The specific facts of one's life may be determined by circumstance. What is not determined is one's attitude. A person can understand his or her life and accept it joyfully, regardless of its state. It is in the acceptance and understanding that choice resides and that gives life its value and dignity.<br /><br />The novel shows the attempt of a poor, but intelligent woman to find &quot;amor fati&quot; and to become who she is. She struggles to accept her nature and her being as a prostitute. Many of Adriana's reflections in the church are quite explicit and insightful. Adriana, alas, is no more successful than are most people in staying with her insight into herself. That, in my opinion, is the tragedy of the story which leads to the downfall of the men involved with Adriana.<br /><br />The spiritual tone of the book goes well beyond Nietzsche. Together with the theme of amor fati, there is a religiosity that emphasizes, in the context of Western theology, God as merciful and as all-forgiving rather than God as a moralizer or judge. This God -- or self-understanding is open to all regardless of creed or station. The religion that seems to be espoused in the book recognizes the sinful, fallen nature of people and their frequent inability to change. It seems to suggest the possibility of atonement and forgiveness offered to everyone by a turning of the heart, even if, perhaps, behavior cannot be changed. It is a powerful picture of a God of mercy and forgiveness who holds the possibility of love out to all.<br /><br />&quot;The Woman of Rome&quot; is a first-rate Twentieth Century novel.<br /><br />Robin FriedmanAdriana does not mention and would not have known of him) used the phrase &quot;amor fati&quot; to describe the wise person's attitude towards life.

Without agreeing with everything he said, I came away from his book with my own ideas clarified and strengthened -- and a bit envious of Needleman's eloquence and ability to put his ideas into print.<br /><br />Needleman draws a double picture of American freedom and its use. One picture is that freedom means everyone does simply as he or she pleases. This is, for Needleman, an America which has been criticized by many for its materialism, its emphasis on growth, its sole focus on the profit motive, its greed, racism, and, sometimes, bellicosity.<br /><br />The other America is a spiritual American whose ideas of freedom and democracy was founded upon religious and metaphysical ideas of the nature of man, human commonality, the uniqueness of each person, and the search inward of each person for what is valuable and important. The ideal of democracy on this view is not simple pursuit of material wealth but rather a turning inward so that each person may pursue life and truth in his or her own way.<br /><br />And what is the relationship between these two concepts of America? How do we help transform the one into the other?<br /><br />Needleman's answer is in part a study of the wisdom literature common to all religions and great philosophy of life. (Needleman evidences a great deal of impatience with standard church or synagogue-going. He argues that he himself has found such conventional forms of religion sterile and routine.) He finds such wisdom, in various of its phases, in the writings of the American founders.<br /><br />Thus the larger part of the book is a discussion and creative discussion of the American founders and a reading of certain of American texts. Thus Needleman gives us a paragraph-by-paragraph discussion of Washington's Farewell Address, The Tenth Federalist Paper, Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address, an Oration of Frederick Douglass, an Iroquois Indian creation myth, and Walt Whitman's late essay, &#34;Democratic Vistas&#34;. He tries to show how these texts show an America of spiritual values rather than money-making. His aim is, avowedly, to remythologize America and its past.<br /><br />In a broad sense his project is carried through well. Some of his readings of the texts, particularly of Washington's Farewell Address and of the Iroquois myth, seem to me forced. Needleman would have done better to let Washington speak for himself rather than create a Washington with, perhaps, Needleman's own spiritual preoccupations. The readings of Whitman, Douglass, and Lincoln work much better, even on Needleman's own terms.<br /><br />In trying to get people to think about America -- and to reassess its values in spiritual terms --Needleman has critical things to say about America's treatment of the Indians and about the long legacy of slavery. These themes are valuable and important and Needleman is right to dwell upon them. I have some question about whether the treatment of the Indians is in itself free from a degree of modern stereotyping. Be that as it may, Needleman's point is that we may see America with its flaws and crimes and love it and try to recognize and bring about the ideal in the sometimes shabby nature of the real.<br /><br />There is a great deal of erudition in this book, both on spiritual texts and on American history. In addition to his treatment of certain standard figures in American history, Needleman has a fascinating discussion of the Ephrata community in Pennsylvania and its founder Conrad Bissel. This Protestant spiritual community flourished briefly during the period just before the Revolutionary War.<br /><br/>Walt Whitman has the last word in this book, as he properly should, with his vision of America and of the American person.<br /><br />There is a great deal of interest, as best as I can tell, in American history, as evidenced by the many new books on the Founders and the unending interest in Lincoln and the Civil War, and in spirituality, which I myself have found in a study of Buddhism. This book combines these two broad themes in an attempt to help the reader rethink and America and understand it anew.

I came to Dawn Powell's work with expectations of such a reward. I knew that the Library of America had saw fit to publish two volumes of her work and that Tim Page, Washington Post classical music critic, had edited the volumes and written a biography. I was eager to learn more.<br /><br />Dawn Powell grew up in rural Ohio and moved to Greenwich Village as a young woman and lived a bohemian life. She wrote 15 novels between the 1930s and the early 1960s mostly set in rural Ohio and Greenwich Village, which were little noted during her life. She has been &#34;rediscovered&#34; and praised highly by some.<br /><br />Dawn Powell's &#34;The Golden Spur&#34; was her last novel and the first book of hers I read. The book tells the story of Jonathan Jamison who, at the age of 26 leaves his Ohio home in search of his father in Greenwich Village. Jonathan's mother had worked as a typist briefly in the Village before she returned home and married what she found a rather conventional man. She delivered prematurely and told Jonathan that his true father was in New York. And Jonathan goes to search for his father --- and himself.<br /><br />The book centers around The Golden Spur, a bar in Greenwich Village frequented by artists and literary types. (It had been frequented by Jonathan's mother in her New York days). We meet a cast of characters who become involved with Jonathan, including Hugow, the bohemian modern painter of questionable talent, a succession of Hugow's former lovers, some of whom are bedded by Johnathan, failed literary critics, academics, has-beens and never wases. We also meet an elderly woman named Claire Van Orphen, the writer for whom Johnathan's mother worked briefly. She befriends Johnathan and is instrumental in his search.<br /><br />I couldn't recommend reading this book for the story-line. It is muddled and hard to follow at times. Nevertheless, I came away from the book thinking that my search to discover a new author had been rewarded.<br /><br />This book is written in a beautiful clear prose. Each line tells and each word is in place. It is a joy to read. The satire in the book is uncompromising and biting. Because the book is a satire, the characters are somewhat one-sided. In addition, I get the impression that Dawn Powell put some part of herself (but not her whole character) in each of the people in her book-- the young person (Jonathan Jamison) leaving rural Ohio for a new life in New York City, the young sexually active women in the Village, the struggling artists, the aging unsuccessful writer to take some examples. Thus I found the characterization effective.<br /><br />The book works better as a series of miniature episodes than as a connected novel. Each scene is tightly written and convincing written, as I indicated, in a lively and supple style. I got absorbed in the book page by page and incident by incident. Possibly as a result of this, there were times when I lost the thread of the story and the interrelationship of the characters.<br /><br />The best part of the book, besides the writing style, is the picture drawn of Greenwich Village. The picture of life in the bars and of artists, some good some not-so-good, struggling in flats with their women, their friends and their agents is precious. Dawn Powell knew the life she described. Again, most of the characters, from the young man, Jonathan Jamison, through the women, through the aging Ms. Van Orphen, were aspects of Dawn Powell herself, transmitted into one character or the other.<br /><br />This is a frothy, light book not without its flaws. But I came away with the sense of discovery for which I had hoped. Dawn Powell deserves to be read.<br /><br />Robin FriedmanNevertheless, I came away from the book thinking that my search to discover a new author had been rewarded.<br /><br />This book is written in a beautiful clear prose.

They consist of original texts with only the slightest endnotes and historical chronology.  (In this book of Madison's writings, the historical chrononogy is excellent)  The disadvantage, if that is the correct word, of the Library of American's series is that reading these books takes substantial effort and digging.  In addition, it is difficult to stop with one book, as each collection relates to and requires and understanding of the work of the other Founders.  The advantage these books offer, though, can't be found anywhere else.  They offer a chance to meet and encounter American's Founders in their own words and on their own terms and to see the development of their thoughts over time.<br />James Madison (1751-1836) was probably America's greatest political thinker.  His career spanned the Revolutionary War, the formation of the Articles of the Confederation, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, the creation of party in America, the Louisiana Purchase, and the War of 1812, which occurred during his Presidency.<br />The Library of America's collection of over 900 pages offers a rare opportunity to read in one place the major writings of James Madison.  It allows the reader an opportunity to assess his importance and to see the themes Madison developed throughout his life.<br />A major contribution of Madison was his insistence on freedom of religion in the United States and his opposition to any established sect.  These theme pervades this volume from the Amendments Madison proposed to the Virginia declaration of rights in 1776, through the Bill of Rights, Madison's Presidency, and beyond.<br />Madison was also the architect of representative government.  He was a member of the Constitutional Convention and took copious notes of its proceedings.  He was the major draftsman of the Constitution.  He spoke for both a strong National government and for representative government -- in which the people chose their leaders.<br />Together with Alexander Hamilton, Madison wrote the Federalist papers which explained the Constitution to the people of New York but in a larger sense to the United States in his day and in succeeding days as well.  This collaboration was significant in that Madison and Hamilton would later quarrel and be the founders of the party system.  Madison and Jefferson spoke for what has become the Democratic Party (the \\"democracy) with its emphasis at the time on individual rights and participatory democracy and a narrow reading of Federal power while Hamilton became the spokseman for a strong central government and for economic development.<br />The book chronicle's Madison's efforts in supporting and drafting the Bill of Rights.  Subsequently, Madison wrote a lengthy article for the State of Virginia expressing opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts that Congress enacted during the Presidency of John Adams.  The opposition was based on the inconsistency of the act with the freedom of speech set forth in the First Amendment and to the lack of authority for these Acts in the original constitution.<br />The book has comparatively little on Madison's career as Secretary of State under Thomas Jefferson and on Madison's own relatively unsuccessful Presidency during the War of 1812.<br />Upon leaving the Presidency, Madison enjoyed a long retirement at Montpelier.  This collection gives a good view of Madison's continued activity during this time.  It discusses his viewson slavery and on the impending Missouri compromise (Madison opposed it -- an opposition that would haunt the United States in the later Dred Scott decision) and on Judicial Supremacy -- the power of the Supreme Court to declare laws unconstitutional.  (Madison agreed the Court had this power but he disagreed with the way Chief Justice Marshall used it.)<br />One of the final items in this book is a short, two paragraph article entitled \\"Advice to my Country\\" written 1n 1834 as a parting before Madison's death.  Looking at the impending conflict between North and South, but speaking to our time as well Madison wrote:<br />  \\"The advice nearest to my heart and deepest in my  convictions is that the Union of the States be cherished and perpetuated.\\"<br />This is an important wish for our country now as then.<br />This book will repay reading and study.  The study of our Founders is, I think, one of the best ways to learn to love and understand our country.on slavery and on the impending Missouri compromise (Madison opposed it -- an opposition that would haunt the United States in the later Dred Scott decision) and on Judicial Supremacy -- the power of the Supreme Court to declare laws unconstitutional.

The story is set in the late 1950s in New Baytown, a small (fictitious) New York -New England town which, Steinbeck tells us, had flourished during the whaling days of the mid-19th century. The main protagonist of the book is Ethan Allen Hawley. Ethan (&#34;eth&#34; to his friends is descended from early pirates and whaling captains. His family had lost its capital through speculative business ventures during WW II and Ethan, with his background and his Harvard education, is reduced to working as a clerk in a small grocery store he once owned. Marullo, an Italian immigrant, owns the store and calls Ethan &#34;kid&#34;.<br /><br />For a short novel, the book includes a wealth of characters, many of which I found well described. There is Ethan's wife Mary who is impatient with the family's impoverished lots and eager for Ethan's economic success as well as the couple's two children, Allen, who is writing an essay called &#34;Why I Love America&#34; and the sexually precocious daughter Ellen. We meet the town banker, Mr. Baker, a bank clerk and a friend of Ethan's, Margie Young-Hunt, twice married and the town seductress, and Danny Taylor, Ethan's childhood friend who has thrown away a career of promise and become a drunk.<br /><br />The book describes the deteriorations of Ethan's life as he gradually loses his integrity and succumbs to temptations to lift his life, and the lives of his family members, from its materially humble state to a state consistent with Ethan's felt family heritage and education and with the desire of his family for material comfort. The story is sad and told in a style mixing irony and ambiguity that requires the reader to reflect and dig into what is happening. The story ends on a highly ambiguous note with Ethan's future left in doubt.<br /><br />The book describes well the lessening of American standards and values. The book seems to attribute the loss to an increasing passion for commercial and economic success among all people in the United States. Juxtaposed with the economic struggle are pictures of, in Steinbeck's view, what America was and what it could struggle to be. I think the images are found in religion (much of the story is, importantly, set around Good Friday and Easter and these holidays figure prominently in the book), and in America's political and cultural heritage.<br /><br />In the old town of New Baytown, America's history casts a long shadow with speeches from American statesmen such as Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and Abraham Lincoln tucked (suggestively) in the family attic. The book is set against a background of New England whaling and reminds the reader inevitably of a culture that produced Melville and a work of the caliber of Moby Dick.<br /><br />The most convincing scenes of the book for me were those where Ethan ruminates his life in his own mind and compulsively walks the streets of New Baytown at night. I was reminded of Robert Frost, a poet of New England and his poem &#34;Acquainted with the Night&#34; which begins:<br /><br /> &#34;I have been one acquainted with the night.<br /> I have walked out in rain -- and back in rain.<br /> I have outwalked the furthest city light.&#34;<br /><br />Steinbeck captures much of the spirit of this wonderful poem.<br /><br />The plot of the book seems contrived at is climax and depends too much on coincidence. The characters, and their inward reflections on themselves, the descriptions, the setting, and the theme of the book, mingled between a love for our country and a sense of despair, make the book memorable.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanss to an increasing passion for commercial and economic success among all people in the United States.

He describes himself early in the book as a democrat with a capital &quot;D&quot;.  However he makes proposals for local control of management decisions on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management Lands in the Western States that are ordinarily associated with Republican or conservative positions.<br />The focus of the book is the &quot;interior west&quot; consisting of the states of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho,Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming.  These states are charcterized by rugged terrain, a lack of water, sparse population, an abundance of timber and extractive resources and a high percentage of Federally owned land.  Kemmis argues that it is no longer good policy for these lands to be managed under the current confusing Federal statutory regime.  He argues for collaboration among westerners and involved users to determine the best ways for the West to manage its lands.<br />Much the best part of this book, for me, was the historical perspective Kemmis brings to his study.  He writes perceptively and well about Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Rossevelt's important but conflicting visions about the American West.  Jefferson, an expansionist in spite of himself, was fascinated with nature but viewd the West as a buffer for National security and as a component of his vision of an America consisting of small yeomen.  Roosevelt too was an expansionist but saw the need of tight Federal control of the West and its resources to protect them for future generations.  Current policy is an uneasy mix of Jeffersonian and Rooseveltian ideas.<br />There is also a good, if brief, discussion of the Lincoln-Douglas debates and how the different visions of these two men played out over time on issues of local versus national control. I found it creative.<br />Kemmis arguues that the West has attained a great deal of sopistication (maturation) since Theodore Roosevelt's days and should be allowed a greater voice in the management of its (the United States') resources.  He maintains that the Federal govenment is increasingly distant from the concerns of the West, and that the current Federal management regime is inconsistent with basic Jeffersonian democracy -- the people managing the resources of concern to them and thus taking a greater control of their own lives.  He argues that Federal statutes and administrative officials are almost uniformly well-intentioned but that the West is too caught in the politics of Washington D.C., resulting in dissatisfaction by those in the region regardless of their other political commitments.<br />In advocating for &quot;collaborationism&quot;, Kemmis is aware of the policy (and law) requring public participation in land use decisions.  He argues that people are reluctant to collaborate when they know that decisionmakers in Washington D.C. will have the ultimate say over the management of their lands.<br />This is a costructive book with many interesing things to say.  As I noted, its strength is that it is historically well-informed.  The weakness of the book is that it is short, overly anectdotal, and not entirely convincing in its claim that the Federal government is an intruder in the management of these lands.  They are Federally owned, after all, to be used for the benefit of the American people.  Less philosophically, I don't think Kemmis is convincing in showing the local control would result in more satisfactory and communally acceptable decision making.  It would simply put the issues back on a local level where they are now in large part anyway.<br />Even though the conclusions are debatable, Kemmis's book is a valuable study of public lands management in the American West and how lands management ties in with our Nation's democratic (small &quot;d&quot;) vision.the West has attained a great deal of sopistication (maturation) since Theodore Roosevelt's days and should be allowed a greater voice in the management of its (the United States') resources.

It is taken from Rickard and Thuan's book, titled \\"The Quantum and the Lotus\\"(p232)<br />A 19th Century Tibetan hermit named Patrul had a disciple named Lungtok.  Lngtok was having difficulty learning to meditate.  One evening while they were outside the monastery overlooking the mountains, Patrul caqlled Lungtok to him and said \\"Didn't you tell me you don't understand the nature of the mind?\\"  \\"Yes\\", Lungtok replied.Patrul asked Lungtok to lie next to him and asked \\"Can you her the monastery dogs barking\\"?  \\"Yes\\"  \\"Can you see the stare shining?\\"  \\"Yes\\",  \\"Well\\" said Patrul, \\"that's meditation.\\"  Shortly after receiving this lesson Luntok received understanding and enlightenment.<br />Soul Mountain is the story of a spiritual quest.  After the narrator learns that he had been wrongly diagnosed with lung cancer, and following prosecution by the Chinese communist authorities as a \\"rightist\\", the narrator leaves Peking -- destination and purpose obscure.  He decides to try to find an obscure mountain called Lingshan or soul mountain.  In the process of his lengthy journey, he travels through remote areas of China where he meets a variety of people, hears Chinese folk, songs, sees archeological sites, learns about Chinese animals and searches.  The search motive is common in religion and literature.  The goal is not set out at the beginning but the narrator seeks to come to a degree of self-understanding and to remove sorrow through reflection and the loosening of attachments.<br />In the process of his lonely journey the narrator develops personnae, or alter egos.  He begins to refer to himself at times as \\"he\\" and then there is a young woman lover, a \\"she\\".  This does not make for clear, easy reading, but it is an appropriate technique for a book which tries to teach about the self.<br />The narrator does not claim to be religious.  Nevertheless, the book for me has a strong Buddhist background.  Gao has obviously thought deeply about and been influenced by Buddhism.  This influence pervades the book and its reflections.  It is most pronounced, however, in the visits to the Buddhist and Daoist monastaries of the narrator  and in his discussions with Buddhist and Daoist monks and nuns.<br />For all the virtues of the search the narrator finds he needs companionship and human society.  In particular he needs the society of women and he craves sexual relationships.  We hear of many of the narrators sexual relationships along his way together with his reflections on \\"he\\" and \\"she\\".  This is a book that talks eloquently of the force of human erotic passion and of the centrality of that passion to the relationship between men and women.  The Buddha would understand.  In a famous text he observes:<br />\\"Monks, I don't knop of even one other form that stays in a man's mind and consumes it like the form of a woman... The touch of a woman stays in a man's mind and consumes it.  Monks, I don't know of even one other form that stays in a woman's mind and consumes it like the form of a man. ... The touch of a man stays in a woman's mind and consumes it.\\"<br />Our narrator finds he cannot abandon his sexuality and opts for human society over the life of a recluse.  This decision does not to me indicate a rejection of spiritual (or Buddhist) values but rather a placement of them in the context of ongoing human reality.  Also the narrators decision to live without meaning seems to me to indicate an agreement with Buddhist teachings of dispassion, selflessness and non-attachment. It is, in the words of Meister Eckhart which many find parallel to Buddhist teachings, \\"Living without a Why.\\"  There is some acceptance of the spiritual values of the Buddhist recluse brought to bear upon living in the everyday.  This, I think, is a teaching the book shares with the Tibetan story with which this review begins.<br />Many people in the West who for whatever reason find themselves unable to accept western theistic religions have explored Buddhism and other eastern religions for whatever guidance they may provide in living a spiritual life outside the boundaries of a traditional Western faith.  In his books, the Dalai Lama, for example, speaks of a \\"secular spirituality\\" which uses insights of self-reflection, compassion, and self-kowledge as a means which may be open to many people independently of their religious belief or lack of religious belief.  I think Soul Mountain is a book with many of the same themes.  People who have thought about spirituality and who are not afraid to experiment with the unfamilar will feel at home with this difficult but highly worthwhile book.lves unable to accept western theistic religions have explored Buddhism and other eastern religions for whatever guidance they may provide in living a spiritual life outside the boundaries of a traditional Western faith.

Science does not satisfy the spiritual needs of man -- his need to end suffering, understand himself, and the nature of his world -- to find meaning.  How is it possible to find religious meaning in a world where science seems to be the only source of knowledge?<br />In his introduction, Ricard argues that science and Buddhism approach reality in different ways.  He finds Buddhism non-dogmatic, willing to accept scientific findings and based on an introspection into the human condition with Buddha as a guide.  Thuan agrees that human beings need spirituality as well as science.<br />There are fifteen chapters discussing with impressing erudition specific scientific issues and how Buddhists might view them.  We get discussions of the &quot;big bang&quot; theory of quantum mechanics, the nature of time, computers and thought, and the nature of consciousness, among other topics.  For a book cast in the form of a discussion, the references are copious.<br />There is a great deal of discussion of Buddhism's focus on indeterminacy and change and its relation to science.  Also, Ricard focuses of the deep and difficult Buddhist teaching of dependent arising.  He tries to argue that this teaching shows the untenability of scientific (or metaphysical) realism -- the view that science describes an independently existing reality.<br />Ricard also takes issue with theism and here he gets something of a disagreement from Thuan who believes in a Spinozistic concept of God (which needs explaining) and is something of a scientific realist.<br />There is a wonderful summation by Thusn:  &quot;Made of stardust, we share the same cosmic history as the lions on the savannas and the lavenders in the fields.  We are all connected through time and space, and thus interdependent.(page 280)<br />Some of this book is highly technical and Ricard, is spite of himself is over dogmatic in places.  This is still a wonderful book.  It teaches a &quot;secular spirituality&quot; in the words of Ricard and may be read with benefit by those with no particular commitment to Buddhism.that this teaching shows the untenability of scientific (or metaphysical) realism -- the view that science describes an independently existing reality.<br />Ricard also takes issue with theism and here he gets something of a disagreement from Thuan who believes in a Spinozistic concept of God (which needs explaining) and is something of a scientific realist.<br />There is a wonderful summation by Thusn:  &quot;Made of stardust, we share the same cosmic history as the lions on the savannas and the lavenders in the fields.

Although based upon Tibetan Buddhism, there is wisdom in the book for anybody seeking spiritual growth, within or without any specific religious practice.<br /><br />The book consists of six short sections. It begins with a brief discussion of the life of the Buddha which, as the Dalai Lama points out, encompasses the basic teachings of the Buddhist path: morality, concentrated meditation and wisdom.  The Dalai Lama then explains the basis of each teaching in short chapters.  It is good that the book gives its focus to moral practice -- curing anger, lust, hatred, and agression and wishing well to oneself and others.<br /><br />Chapter III of the book discusses meditation practices and will introduce the beginner to the value of meditation and to several meditation techniques.  The Dalai Lama stresses the need for consistent practice and for patience and for the need of controlling one's expectations.<br /><br />There are several chapters which discuss the difficult but key Buddhist teaching of dependent origination.  Much of this material the Dalai Lama also covers in an earlier book called \\"The Meaning of Life.\\"<br /><br />There is a concluding section on Tantra, a uniquely Tibetan practice.  I think it is better for the average person to remain with the practices of morality and concentration described earlier in the book.<br /><br />Some of the unique features of this book are the Dalai Lama's anecdotes of his life in Tibet before the Chinese Invasion of 1950 and of his teachers.  There is a substantial discussion of sexuality in the book and of how it may be used (and abused) in the search for peace and kindness. (pages 192-196)  There is a translation of the Heart Sutra, a key Buddhist text with a commentary by the Dalai Lama. (159-163)<br /><br />I found the Dalai Lama's concluding paragraph captures much of the tenor and the value of this book (page 223):<br /><br />  \\"Though my own knowledge is limited and my experience is  also very poor, I have tried my best to help you understand the full breadth of the Buddha's teaching.  Please implement whatever in these pages appears to be helpful.  If you follow another religion, please adopt whatever might assist you.  If you do not think it would be helpful, just leave it alone.\\"ntary by the Dalai Lama.

Although John Adams has frequently been regarded as the least understood of the Founders, Hamilton has his own plausible claim to this honor. History has not treated Hamilton kindly. He has certain obvious flaws in terms of arrogance,temper, and judgment.These flaws are amply revealed in this collection of writings. Hamilton, nevertheless, has much to teach us about government and about our country.  This collection of his writings is a treasure.<br />At the outset, I was reluctant to begin a project of reading this volume through in its entirety. As my reading progressed, I couldn't put the volume down.<br />The book covers all phases of Hamilton's political and personal life, from its beginnings in what is now the U.S. Virgin Islands to his death at age 49 in the notorious duel with Aaron Burr. The heart of the book begins with Hamilton's role in the Constitutional Convention, in which he advocated for a strong Federal government and, in particular for a strong Executive. The book continues with Hamilton's 51 contributions to \\"The Federalist\\" in which he explained the Constitution to the people of the State of New York in terms which remain a seminal exposition of the basic governing document of the United States. Again the focus is on the need for a strong central government with a will and ability to act for the public good.<br />Hamilton was the first Secretary of the Treasury.  This book gives us long selections from his work in which he advocated forcefully for having the Federal government pay the Revolutionary War Debt, for founding the Bank of the United States, and in promoting industry in the fledgling United States. These works divided Hamilton from Jefferson and Madison and became the basis of partisan politics in the United States.<br />In defending the constitutionality of the National Bank from attacks from Jefferson and Madison, Hamilton set the foundation for an expansive view of the power of the Federal government under the constitution.  This view was controversial in its time and remains so.  Hamilton's position, however, has largely come to prevail over the years and is an important basis for our governmental structure as it has developed over time.<br />The book includes Hamilton's public confession of an adulterous affair, his criticism of John Adams which divided and doomed the Federalist party, and Hamilton's own political career,  and documents regarding Hamilton's fatal duel with Aaron Burr.<br />There is much to be learned from this book. Hamilton was a paradoxical figure both behind and ahead of his time. This is a valuable work for understanding our country. Kudos to the Library of America for allowing us to learn.onality of the National Bank from attacks from Jefferson and Madison, Hamilton set the foundation for an expansive view of the power of the Federal government under the constitution.

The metaphor of \\"escapism\\" pervades the book.  People use magic and comics both to escape from the humdrum of the everyday and to have heros.  During the 1930s and 1940s, as this book illustrates, people endeavored to escape from Nazi Germany and subsequently from communism.  People attempt to \\"escape\\" from themselves in the book too when they deny themselves and their sexuality.<br />The book follows the adventures of Josef Kavalier and Sammy Clay, cousins. The book and the characters are factually based, but this book, make no mistake, is a work of fiction and imagination.  In a note the author tells us that \\"I have tried to respect history and geography whenever doing so served my purposes as a novelist, but whenever it did not I have cheerfully or with regret, ignored them.\\"<br />Kavalier grew up in Prague, the child of educated, assimilated Jewish parents and in Prague he studies magic and art.  He escapes from Prague and joins his cousin Sammy in New York. Sammy is raised by his mother, the father having abandoned the family.<br />Josef is a talented artist and Sammy a writer.  Sammy persuades the novelty salesman for whom he works to publish a comics character he and Josef have created, \\"the escapist\\" which becomes a great commercial success. The character is initially created as a strong fighter of Hitler's Germany.  Josef hopes to use the character to rescue his family in Prague. Sammy and Josef, alas, are cheated out of much of the financial reward that should have been theirs from their creation.<br />There is a complicated love plot, as Josef meets an American woman and Sammy discovers his homosexuality.  Josef enlists in the Navy and there are startling scene shifts describing his adventures in Antartica where he carries out his own war against Germany.<br />The book is too long for its material but it mostly reads welll. Some of the finest writing is in the details with the occasional pointed metaphor.  Also, the author at times departs from his story and gives us in his own voice what purports to be factual information about the comic book industry, the characters, or New York.  I found this technique worked well.  The characters are well developed and there are wonderful descriptions of New York City and of the comic book industry. (I liked the descriptions of Prague and Antarctica less well.)<br />The book itself mirrors its story.  It is \\"escapist\\" in that it is a robust, improbable tale different from the quiet lives most of its readers will lead.  The author loves his subject, the comics in particular and New York City.  He wants the reader to see the comics as something of an American art form.  He is very far from persuading me to do so, but the vibrancy, liveliness, and talent of his characters is compelling.<br />There isn't much of a focus in this book and it doesn't measure up to the epic cast that the author tries to give it.  Readers that like this book might enjoy Martin Dressler by Steven Millhauser.  Millhuaser's book, as did this book, won a Pulitzer Prize and covers the same themes in a more succinct, evocative way.  Also, Doctorow's City of God is similar to this book in the way it discusses and praises American culture (on a more highbrow level) although that book has more overtly religious themes.<br />In spite of its shortcomings, the book is Pulitzer Prize quality.  Most importantly, it shows the course and promise of American life.  This is a worthy theme of an enjoyable book.lll.

Another less than happy historical incident also forms a boundary of the story:  the forced removal of the Navajo Tribe from its ancestral home in the 1860s, with a great toll of death and suffering, followed by the return some years later of the Navajos to their current Reservation.  Cather develops her timeless and asture story against the background of these events.<br /><br />Cather's book tells the story of Father Jean Pierre LaTour, a French priest who has come to the Ohio Valley to do missionary work.  With the United States' acquisition of New Mexico, the Church sends him on an arduous journey to Santa Fe to become the Bishop and to revitalize the Catholic Church.  He is soon joined in Santa Fe by his long-time friend from his seminary days in France, Father Joseph Valliant. LaTour is scholarly and aloof, while Valliant is emotional and impulsive, a man of the people.  A great deal of Cather's book centers on the friendship between the two priests.  Cather changed the names of her characters, but the depiction of the two priests is historically based.  Cather adopted and idealized their portrayals for her purposes in the novel. Other historical figures in the novel include the scout Kit Carson, who receives a sympathetic portrayal, and the native priest Padre Martinez, who attempts to break away from the orthodox Catholicism of Father LaTour and to found his own order. Martinez receives a less than sympathetic portrait from Cather.<br /><br />Over the years of the story, LaTour and Valliant wander the deserts and small settlements of New Mexico and Arizona in an attempt to bring Catholicism to the people. During the timeframe of the book, the territory was inhabited largely by Indians and by Mexicans with only a few settlers from the States.  As the book progresses, the pace of settlement quickens, as LaTour lives to regret the changed, urban character of Santa Fe where he builds a glorious cathedral. Cather is at her best in her descriptions of the landscape of the American Southwest, its distances, bleakness, deserts, heat, frost, wind, and cold.  Cather offers a portrait of the Indian people, and the high mesas on which some of them lived.  She shows a sensitivity to native Indian religions, which persisted through the Indians' nominal conversion to Catholicism.<br /><br />With her attraction to the Southwest and its people, Cather also was greatly devoted to French culture and to the life of the mind.  There are many descriptions in the book of LaTour and Valliant's love for French art, literature, wine, and cuisine and music. I had the feeling that Cather wanted to bring the best of European civilization to the New World.  Yet, both LaTour and Valliant fall in love with their new homeland and LaTour declines the opportunity to spend his final years in a university position in France.<br /><br />Cather wrote this book to emphasize the importance of religion in American life and in the settlement of the Southwest in particular.  She had become dismayed by the increased emphasis on materialism, individuality, and sensuality that she saw in her contemporary America of the 1920s.  She thus wrote a book that modified the usual picture of American expansionism to focus on religion. Today, as in Cather's day, many people overlook the role religion has played in shaping the American experience.<br /><br />As a young woman, Cather had converted from the Baptist to the Episcopalian form of Protestantism.  She never became a Catholic, but she studied and learned a great deal from Catholicism that is reflected in this book.  She emphasizes a life of simple piety, devotion, and order, finding God in the everyday. There are many beautiful passages in the book on the Virgin Mary and her role in Catholicism, and discussions of piety, celibacy,miracles, and living a quiet contented life.<br /><br />\\"Death Comes for the Archbishop\\" has always been a difficult book to classify.  The work has a surprisingly modernist structure for a novel, with its lack of a plot line.  The book has a historical setting, but it should not be read as history. It is concerned with a religion in which Cather did not herself believe and it shows her hero, LaTour, as enduring many moments of doubt. The picture that emerges is ultimately one of serenity and faith, but it is a harder and more complex vision than may appear on the surface.<br /><br />I was pleased to have the opportunity to reread and rethink \\"Death Comes for the Archbishop\\" when I read it with a book group. Many critics prefer some of Cather's lesser-known works, such as \\"A Lost Lady\\" or \\"The Professor's House\\" to this famous novel.

Although the story was clearly subtitled as \\"a story\\" and bore the name of its author, it soon assumed a life of its own. \\"Yosl Rakover\\" became published over the years in some sources as a first-person account by a martyr who died in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising.<br />The story is best known for its protagonists reflections on a \\"God who hides his face.\\"Yosl continues his belief in God and in the Torah while he confronts God with the senseless, undeserved suffering endured by the Ghetto Resistance and by those who suffered and died in the Holocaust.<br />In this book, we have the text of Kolitz's story together with a lengthy essay by Paul Badde which addresses the history of the story and its author.<br />I found most fascinating about this book,however,the two essays by Emmanuel Levinas, the great French philosopher, and Leon Wieseltier. In their different ways the two essays discuss and comment on Kolitz's tale and take issue with each other.<br />Levinas' essay, rirst published in 1955, recognizes the fictional character of the account. He sees the book as creating an internal (rather than a transcendent) concept of God emphasizing the importance of human ethics.  This is consistent with the rest of Levinas's philosphy, but it may not capture the essence of Kolitz's.<br />In his essay, Wiesentheler takes issue with Levinas's reading and takes issue as well with the theistic approach of Kolitz's story.  I find this a courageous approach. Modern readers may well have difficulty with Koolitz' rendering of the Holocaust because of the difficulty they have in finding God through the face of sheer evil. Every reader will need to face this question for him or herself.<br />A thoughtful book raising difficult concerns.	2002-02-13

Together with My Antonia it is the novel for which she is best known.  Years after writing the book, Cather wrote of it \\" Since I wrote this book for myself,  I ignored  all the situations and accents that were then thought to be necessary.\\"<br />The book takes place on the plains of Nebraska in the late 19th Century as the Prairie is settled be Swedish, Bohemian, and French immigrants trying to eke out a living from what appears to be a harsh, inhospitable land.  The heroine of the book is Alexandra Bergson who inherits her father's farm as a young woman, raises his three sons and stays with the farm through the harsh times to become a successful landowner and farmer.<br />The books speaks of being wedded to the land and to place.  In this sense it is an instance of the American dream of a home. It also speaks of a strong woman, not in cliched, late 20th Century terms but with a sense of ambiguity, difficulty and loss.<br />This is a story as well of thwarted love, of the difficult nature of sexualtiy, and of human passion.  There is also the beginning of what in Cather's works will become an increased sense of religion, Catholicism in particular, as a haven and a solace for the sorrow she finds at the heart of human endeavor. Above all it is a picuure of stark life in the midwest.<br />There is almost as much blood-letting in this short book as in an Elizabethan tragedy.  Cather's picture of American life on the plains, even in her earliest books, is not an easy or simple one.  Some readers may quarrel with the seemingly happy ending of the book.  I don't think any will deny that Alexandra's happiness is dearly bought or that it is bittersweet.<br />I tendend to shy away from this book in favor of Cather's later novels.  I feared that it would be conventional and trite.  The stereotyping was mine,however.  This is a thoughtful, well written story of immigrant life on the plains and of the sorrow  pain, and strength of the American experience.rrow  pain, and strength of the American experience.	2002-02-02

The LOA also has published a two volume set of Nineteenth Century American poetry, one volume of Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century poetry and a volume of American religious and spiritual poetry. American poetry richly deserves this extensive treatment, and this series may serve to introduce America's poets to a growing number of readers.<br /><br />This volume begins with E.E.Cummings (b 1894) and concludes with May Swenson (b 1913) The volume has almost an embarrassment of riches. By my count there are 122 separate poets included. The book includes a brief biography of each writer included which is invaluable for reading his or her poems in the volume.<br /><br />As with any anthology of this nature, the selection is a compromise between inclusiveness and quality. Readers may quarrel with the relative weight given to various poets in terms of number of pages, and with the inclusion or exclusion of writers. (I was disappointed that a poet I admire, Horace Gregory, gets only two pages, for example). Overall, it is a wonderful volume and includes some great poetry.<br /><br />There are favorites and familiar names here and names that will be familiar to few. A joy of a book such as this is to see favorites and to learn about poets one hasn't read before.<br /><br />A major feature of this volume is its emphasis on diversity -- much more so than in volume 1 or in the Library of America's 19th century poetry anthologies. There are many Jewish poets (including Charles Reznikoff, a long-time favorite of mine, Louis Zukofsky, Alter Brody, Rose Drachler, George Oppen, Karl Shapiro, and others) and even more African-American poets (Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, Richard Wright, Waring Cuney, Sterling Brown, Arna Bontemps, Robert Hayden and many more.) There are also selections from blues and popular songs.<br /><br />Of the poets unknown to me, I enjoyed particularly Lorine Niedecker, Laura Riding, and Janet Lewis -- women are well represented in this volume.<br /><br />Perhaps an emblematic single line for this volume would be &#34;My hand in yours, Walt Whitman --so&#34; -- taken from the &#34;Cape Hatteras&#34; section of &#34;The Bridge&#34; by Hart Crane. Crane has more pages devoted to him than any other writer in the volume and deservedly so. &#34;The Bridge&#34; and &#34;Voyages&#34; are presented complete together with some of the shorter poems. This tragic, tormented and gifted writer tried in &#34;The Bridge&#34; to present a vision of America mystical in character, celebratory of the American experience, and inclusive in its diversity. The poem is a worthy successor to the poetry of Whitman who is celebrated throughout &#34;The Bridge&#34;.<br /><br />This volume together with its companion volume in the LOA constitute an outstanding way to explore the richness, diversity, and artistic achievement of Twentieth Century American poetry.<br /><br />Robin Friedman<br /><br />Original Review of January 29, 2002 as revised April 11, 2017Riding, and Janet Lewis -- women are well represented in this volume.

The setting of the story was moved to San Francisco at the behest of the publisher.<br />The book tells the story of the love, and its end, between Leo Percepied, the Kerouac character, and Mardou Fox. Mardou is half Cherokee and half black.  She has grown up in poverty in Oakland and has suffered serious emotional breakdowns.  She has gone from lover to lover among the Bohemia of San Fransisco until she meets up with Leo.<br />The book shows some of Kerouac's understanding of his own character.  He describes himself (page 1) as both an &quot;unself-confident man&quot; and as an &quot;egomaniac&quot;.  A few pages later (page 3) he confesses that &quot;I am crudely malely sexual and cannot help myself and have lecherous and so on propensities as almost all my male readers no doubt are the same.&quot;<br />The Subterraneans are a group of hipsters, aspiring artists, drop-outs, con men who inhabit that bars and streets of San Fransiscon graphically described in this book.  The book is full of mean streets, cold water flats, alleys, run-down stores, cheap bars, late evenings, pushcarts, and sad mornings.<br />Leo is initally sexually attracted to Mardou.  When he learns and listens to her he truly falls in love.  She is indeed a lovable character. The picture of the love is convincing.  Unfortunately Leo/Kerouac remained throughout his life a mother's boy.  Mardou tells him, properly and sensibly &quot;Leo, I don't think it good for you to live with your mother always&quot; (p47)  Leo nonetheless can't part from his mother. He also has doubts about his ability to commit to a black woman, particularly given the prejudice of his mother and sister.  He dumps Mardou.  It is his loss.<br />The book is written in long stringy sentences to imitate the &quot;bop&quot; improvisatory style of jazz riffs.  I was put of by the style when I began the book but came away concluding it fit the subject matter.  The apparent spontaneity and the sincerity of the narrative move the story along.<br />The book describes well the American hipster of the 1950s.  It is ultimately a story of the need for love and the difficulty of commitment.  It is a sad story and I think in the emphasis on the wildness of Bohemia can easily be misunderstood.  Kerouac may have been somewhat wiser as a writer than he was as a man. He was able to take his inability to form a lasting relationship with a woman and describe it.

The apparent spontaneity and the sincerity of the narrative move the story along.<br />The book describes well the American hipster of the 1950s.  It is ultimately a story of the need for love and the difficulty of commitment.  It is a sad story and I think in the emphasis on the wildness of Bohemia can easily be misunderstood.  Kerouac may have been somewhat wiser as a writer than he was as a man. He was able to take his inability to form a lasting relationship with a woman and describe it.  He turned his experiences and personal difficulties into a poignant and lasting novel.  Art in Kerouac as in so many writers becomes a way of understanding and transcending one's life.	2002-01-09

At some point, readers will look back at our Twentieth Century poetry as a benchmark of literature and a guide to the thoughts, feelings, and events of our difficult century.<br /><br />In this, the first of two currently available volumes of Twentieth Century American poetry, the Library of America gives access to a treasure of reading that is moving, elevating, and disturbing. The book consists of readings from 85 poets, arranged chronologically by the poet's birthday. The earliest writer in the volume is Henry Adams (b. 1838) and the concluding writer is Dorothy Parker (b. 1893). Some writers that flourished later in life, such as Wallace Stevens, thus appear in the volume before works of their peers, such as Pound and Elliot, who became famous earlier.<br /><br />For me, the major poets in the volume are Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens, W.C. Williams, Ezra Pound, T.S. Elliot, Marianne Moore. They are represented by generous selections, including Elliot's &#34;The Waste Land&#34;, Stevens' &#34;Notes Towards a Supreme Fiction&#34;, and several Pound Canto's given in their entirety.<br /><br />It is the mark of a great literary period that there are many writers almost equally meriting attention together with the great names. There are many outstanding writers here, some known, some unknown. To name only a few, I would include E.A. Robinson, James Weldon Johnson, Adelaide Crapsey, Vachel Lindsay, Sara Teasdale, H.D. Robinson Jeffers, John Crowe Ransom, Conrad Aiken, and Samuel Greenberg. It would be easy to go on.<br /><br />There are different ways to read an anthology such as this LOA volume. One way is to browse reading poems as they catch the reader's eye. Another way is to read favorite poems the reader already knows. I suggest making the effort to read the volume through from cover to cover. Before beginning reading each individual poet, the reader might consult the biographical summary at the end of the volume. These brief biographies illuminate both the poets and their poetry. The notes are sparse, but foreign terms in Pound and Elliot's poetry are translated. In the case of Elliot and Marianne Moore, the volume offers selections from their own notes.<br /><br />By reading the volume through, one gets a sense of continuity and context. Then, the reader can devote attention to individual poems. Some twentieth century works, such as those by Pound, Elliott, Moore, or Stevens are notoriously difficult. Read the works through if you are coming to them for the first time, and return to them later.<br /><br />I was familiar with many of the poems in the book before reading the anthology but much was new to me. I learned a great deal. My favorite poet remains Wallace Stevens, partly because he combined the life of a man of affairs, as an attorney and insurance executive, with deep art. This remains an ideal for me. It is true as well for W.C. Williams, although I am less fond of his poetry.<br /><br />In a poem in this volume, &#34;Libretto&#34; (p. 371) Ezra Pound wrote: &#34;What thou lovest well is thy true heritage&#34;. Pound's observation is the best single sentence summation I can think of for the contents of this volume.<br /><br />Robin Friedman<br /><br />Original Review of January 7, 2002, revised April 11, 2017t the end of the volume.

The story takes place in the early twentienth century and contrasts the American plains, the small town of Haverford, Nebraska, with Chicago, large urban American with its promise and perils.  The heroine of the book, Lucy Gayheart, has great pianistic talent.  She leaves Haverford at the age of 18 to study piano, and to give music lessons, in Chicago.<br />In Chicago she meets a great but disillusioned and world-weary singer, Clement Sebastian, and has the opportunity to work with him as an accompanyist.  There are wonderful descriptions of Schubert song-cycles: the Winterreise and the Miller's Lovely Daughter.  She ultimately is seemingly faced with the choice between Sebastian and her hometown sweetheart.<br />Faced with tragedy from both men in Chicago, Lucy returns home.  She gears herself to begin life anew but tragedy again intervenes.<br />There is a great deal of description in the book of the snow andthe cold, in both Chicago and Haverford.  The book also has for me a feel for the tragic sense of life, with a hint of the power of art and religious faith to overcome it.  The opposition  between city life and provincial town life is similar to Sinclair Lewis's Main Street but with more depth and craft in the writing.  The love for music, the human voice and the piano eloquently comes through the book.<br />This is a beautifully wrought book which deserves to be better known.	2001-12-28

His work, explaining the different ways in which human beings approach the unknown and seek transcendence and meaning for themselves is itself one of the best ways to gain an appreciation of the importance of religion and spirituality.<br />This book, Professor Huston's most recent, has a somewhat more ambitious goal than simply explaining and describing religious teaching.  He tries to explain, in the words of his title, &quot;why religion matters&quot; and why it is of the highest importance to many people.<br />Although much of the book is eloquent and convincing, I found much of it unduly polemical and unconvincing.  In particular, the first half of the book is taken up with a discussion and refutation of &quot;scientism&quot; which is the view that science is the only guide to the truth and out only source of knowledge.  There is a wide-ranging attack on scientism, which broadens into a critique of the secular American university and of certain court decisions, which is intended to show not so much that scientism is wrong or incorrect but that it hasn't been proven.  This is a worthy goal but the specifics misfire.  In particular, Professor Smith spends too much time in criticising Darwinism and the theory of evolution, a criticism which I find markedly unsuccessful and probably unnecessary if I understand his broader claims correctly.  He spends far too much time, I think, discussing a straw man, Hollywood's version of the Scopes trial, &quot;Inherit the Wind.&quot;<br />The stronger portion of the book is included in part 2 which speaks eloquently of the nature of religious life, of the search for a transcendent reality separate from the world of everyday impulse and of the different ways religions have for approaching the divine.  Professor Smith rightly ties in the religious quest with the quest of traditional metaphysics for the &quot;big picture&quot;  as in Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus,Thomas Aquinas, Spinoza, Kant.<br />In essence, as I understand Professor Smith, he argues that we don't know that the world of science is all that there is.  Science is limited to a certain type of human cognition which may not be the complete story of the universe.  This is, although Professor Smith does not point it out, a Kantian conclusion.  Professor Smith also wants to make a great point over descriptions of religious attitudes and aspirations in explaining why religion matters.  Here he comes closer to well stating his case.<br />The book is rather digressive in style.  It was not written for the academic specialist.  Some of the stories and anecdotes although intereting and well told are overly chatty and distract from the main points of the book.  Also, a bibliography and citations to the many sources Professor Smith cites would have helped me understand the book and follow-up on points he makes.<br />I am not sure after reading this book if asking about the relationship between science and religion is itself asking the correct question to help understand religion.  Professor Smith did not entirely convince me in his discussion of the relationship between the two, but he did come closer in convincing me, in his discussion of the religious attidtude,that he understands a great deal about the religious needs of human beings.us,Thomas Aquinas, Spinoza, Kant.<br />In essence, as I understand Professor Smith, he argues that we don't know that the world of science is all that there is.

This book is an anthology of essays written between 1994 and 2000 on a spectrum of Jewish themes and with a diversity of perspectives. In the introduction to the collection, titled, \\"Jewish Writing and Healing the World\\", Rabbi Lerner explains the basis for his choices and his understanding of the mission of Judaism as healing.<br />According to Rabbi Lerner:<br />\\"I have sought out writing that connects to or relfects the fundamental Jewish project of healing and transformation, both personal transformation (tikkun atzmia) and healing of the world (tikkun olam)-- understanding that this healing involves not only psychological or social change but also a search for ways to bring holiness into our personal lives and social institutions.\\"<br />He gives a sweeping, and in my view rather partial, description of his vision of Judaism focused almost exclusively on the claims of social justice : \\"the social, political and economic order of society needs to be changed and can be changed\\".<br />The essays Rabbi Lerner has selected fulfill admirably has goal of explaining Judaism as social change. To his credit, however, the essays reflect something of an attempt to include diverse perspectives, not simply the standards of politically correct feminism, environmentalism and other causes which appear to reflect Rabbi Lerner's own understanding of the nature of changing the world.<br />The essays are divided into six sections dealing with Jewish identity, reclaiming Jewish Spiritual Life, Reading Jewish Sacred Texts, the Holocaust, Israel, and Jewish Culture. Each section includes essays, poems, and fiction some of which is insighful but some of which tempted me to stop reading the book.As a whole the essays are thoughtful and provocative and give a good idea of lively issues in contemprorary Jewish thinking. I would have liked to have heard more about Jewish spirituality and alternatives to traditionalism and less about feminism and ecology.<br />The essays that I found worthwhile include David Biale's discussion of the melting pot, Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, Arthur Green, Dennis Prager and Mordechai Gafni with their strikingly different perspectives on Jewish spirituality, Dahlia Ravikovitch's essay on Israel and the Diaspora in Jewish thought, and Roger Kamenetz on Jewish spirituality. I enjoyed many of the poems and other articles as well. I hadn't heard of Naomi Eve and liked the excerpt \\"Esther and Yochanan\\" from her novel.<br />An excellent feature of this book is Rabbi Lerner's list of \\"The One Hundred Best Contemproary Jewish Books\\" written since 1985. There is much of value in this list and it is a source for thought and for further reading for those interested in pursuing contemporary Jewish writing.<br />Rabbi Lerner says there will be a follow-up volume next year featuring Jewish writing from 2000-2001.

As a youth, he rejected the primary gods of Egypt and worshipped the sun.  Subsequently, he came to the concept of a singly, incorporeal God, accessible to all human beings who ruled the universe with love and asked only that people love him and each other and treat each other with kindness and justice.  Ahkenaton was removed from the throne after alienating the priests of the traditional Egyptian gods and died shortly thereafter, probably the result of assasination.<br />The novel is told by a young Egyptian, Meriamun, who is fascinated by the story of the &quot;heretical&quot; Pharoah and seeks to learn his story by interviewing those close to him.  Meriamum's father reluctantly allows his son to follow this path, writes him letters of introduction, and counsels him to &quot;be like history, impartial and open to every witness.  Then deliver a truth that is free of bias for those who wish to contemplate it.&quot;<br />Following the introduction, the book consists of Meriamun's interviews with those close to Akhenaton, including his teacher, the pagan priests, the security guard, his priest, physician,  a woman from the harem, and his wife, Neferiti.<br />Each of these people has his or her own story to tell about Akhenaten.  They bring their own standpoint to bear upon his religion, his leadership as the Pharoah, has sexuality, and his sanity.<br />We see the situation as more complex than a courageous, lone individual finding a way to monotheism.  The priests have their point too as Akhenaton is a weak ruler, provokes or at least fails to discourage civil war, and, most pointedly, issues an order forbidding the worshippers of Egypt's traditional gods to worship in their own fashion.<br />Through all this, the sense of ethical and mystical idealism shines through the book and through the portrayal of Ahkenaton.<br />The book stimulates thought on the nature of religion, its relationship to the world of practical politics and the nature too of fanaticism.  Ultimately, I think,  the book is a parable of spriritual seeking similar in some ways to Hesse's Siddhartha. On one level, the seeker is Akhenaten.  On a second level, the seeker is the narrator Meriamun.  On the third and most important level the seeker is the reader as he or she becomes drawn into the story and reflects upon its significance.<br />This is a deceptively simple story worth reading.hrough all this, the sense of ethical and mystical idealism shines through the book and through the portrayal of Ahkenaton.<br />The book stimulates thought on the nature of religion, its relationship to the world of practical politics and the nature too of fanaticism.

He received the Nobel Prize for literature in 1980.  In his long life, he has seen and written about many of the events of the Twentieth Century, including the Russian Revolution, the Holocaust, the Warsaw Uprising, and the rise and fall of communism. He served as a diplomat from Poland to the United States following WWII. Among his books is an incisive critique of communism titled &quot;The Captive Mind&quot;.<br />&quot;To begin where I am&quot; is a selection of Milosz's essays published between 1942 and 1998, some written initially in English, but most written in Polish.  The essays are wide-ranging  in theme and capture a great deal of the scope of  Milosz's passions.  The good introduction to the book by Bogdana Carpenter and Madeline Levine point out that Milosz &quot;has centered his writings on a few fundamental philosophical questions: the meaning of history; the existence of evil and suffering; the transience of all life; theascendance of a scientific worldview andthe decline of the religious imagination.&quot; The essays are well-arranged into four main sections.<br />The first group of essays titled &quot;These Guests of Mine&quot; is primarily historical and descriptive in character. I enjoyed particularly Milosz's description of Wilno(Vilna) in his &quot;Dictionary of Wilno Streets.&quot;<br />For me the heart of the book is in the second and third parts, titled &quot;On the Side of Man&quot; and &quot;Against Incomprehensible Poetry.&quot;  We learn a great deal about a writer by his discussions of those who have influenced him.  In this book,Miloscz's essays on the American poet Robinson Jeffers, on the Russian philospher Lev Shestov, and on the French theological thinker Simone Weil are highly thoughtful.  They reveal a writer both struggling for a commitment to religion, to Catholicism in particular, in the face of a scientific and material worldview which he finds inconsistent with it, and a writer committed to humanism, to the best in man and culture.  They are an inspiring and difficult set of commitments, and Milosz discusses them eloquently.<br />In Part 3 of the book, the centerpiece is the title essay &quot;Against Incomprehensible Poetry&quot;.  In this essay, Milosz develops insights from W.H. Auden and makes them his own.  Auden had said &quot;there is only one thing that all poetry must do,it must praise all it can for being and for happening.&quot; (p.381). This insight becomes the basis of a critique of much obscurantism in modern poetry.  We are privileged to hear, in the book, a discussion of the continuing value of poetry and informed discussion of many poets worth knowing, from Whitman, Blake,and Jeffers to many of Milosz's Polish contempories.  These latter writers are unknown to me, but Milosz makes one wish for them as companions through his discussions.<br />The fourth part of the book. &quot;In Constant Amazement&quot;, is brief and consists of a collection of aphorisms. The aphorism I found most striking discusses the nature of human sexuality.  It begins: &quot;Men and women carry within their imagination an image of themselves and of others as sexual beings and often that is the only thing that humanizes them.&quot; (p. 436)<br />This book helped me with my own thinking and reflection.  I hope it will help you with yours as well.and a writer committed to humanism, to the best in man and culture.

It is similar to the four-volume series the Library of America subsequently published on the American Civil War.<br /><br />The book consists of a collection of source material on the American Revolution. It begins with Paul Revere's account of his famous ride of April 18, 1775, and it concludes with two accounts of George Washington resigning his commission to the Continental Congress on December 23, 1783, and expressing his wish to return to private life.<br /><br />The book includes writings from the famous (George Washington, John and Abigail Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Tom Paine, and many others); the infamous (Benedict Arnold); and the obscure as they reflect upon and describe the events which helped create our Nation. The anthology also includes source material about virtually every important theater of the Revolutionary War. The reader learns about Bunker Hill, the British occupation of New York, the War in Canada, fighting on the frontier with George Rogers Clark, swamp fighting in South Carolina, and the Siege of Yorktown.<br /><br />A great merit of the book is that it allows many types of participants to speak. In particular, the book includes a great deal of material from the British and from their Loyalist (&#34;Tory&#34;) American allies. It includes as well writings by Indians, African-Americans, the French, the Hessians describing their varied roles in the conflict. The book shows the reader different perspectives on events. It encourages thought and the avoidance of patterned responses.<br /><br />Some of this source material is difficult to absorb and to organize, particularly for readers lacking a basic familiarity with the course of the Revolutionary War.. Thus, the material ancillary to the text which provides explanation and background is invaluable. It should be consulted repeatedly as the reader works through the volume. It consists of a chronology of the years 1774-1783, biographical notes of the authors of the selections, notes on the sources for the selections, and textual notes. As usual with the Library of America volumes, the textual notes are not extensive. A series of maps illustrating the theatres of the war would have been a welcome addition.<br /><br />The ambitious reader might want to supplement this book with an account of the general history of the Revolution, particularly with a discussion of the ideals for which the colonists were fighting. I suggest Bernard Bailyn's &#34;The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution&#34; for those who might wish a detailed, scholarly account of the factors driving independence. The Library of America also has published many outstanding volumes of source material on the Founders and on other aspects of the Revolutionary Era. I have learned a great deal from these volumes over the years.<br /><br />This book will encourage reflection on the value and significance of Independence and of how the principles for which the colonists fought can continue to inform, enrich, and shape our Nation.<br /><br />Robin Friedman<br />.1783, biographical notes of the authors of the selections, notes on the sources for the selections, and textual notes.

The Dalai Lama gave the first teaching (which constitutes the Introduction to this book) in Central Park on August 15, 1999 to a gathering of 200,000 people. He gave the second teaching as a series of lectures to an audience of 3,000 people in Manhattan's Beacon Theater.<br />The individual lecture and the series of lectures each capture something essential about the Dalai Lama's teaching and his manner of presenting it. The Central Park lecture appears designed for a large, lay audience of diverse backgrounds and religious interests. It presupposes no particular knowledge of or interest in Buddhism. In the lecture, the Dalai Lama speaks simply and eloquently about the desire of all people to secure happiness. He talks about how this goal can be achieved, with time and effort, by understanding and curbing our desires for material things, by recognizing the essential equality of human nature and human drives everywhere, and by generating compassion. There is topical material included in this lecture on matters such as protecting the environment, the noise and bustle of New York City, and the sometimes drastic consequences of fanaticism and nationalism.<br />The series of lectures, in contrast to the Central Park lecture, is specifically Buddhist in character. The Dalai Lama tells us that the lectures are based in large part on two Buddhist tests: the &quot;Middle-Length States of Meditation&quot;, by an eight-century Indian writer, Kamalashila, and &quot;The Thirty-Seven Practices of Bodhisattvas&quot; by a fourteenth century Tibetan, Togmay Sangpo.<br />In very short succinct chapters, the Dalai Lama's lectures explain the heart of Buddhist practice for a Western audience. They discuss the origin of suffering and unhappiness in our emotions, desires, and angers which color in turn the ways we perceive the world and make us unhappy. The Dalai Lama presents and discusses meditation and reflection as making a beginning toward breaking out of the unhappy character of impulsive, emotion-driven existence. By learning about ourselves, by trying to understand the &quot;emptiness&quot; of reality, and by generating compassion for others, we achieve equanamity and happiness for ourselves.<br />It is the mark of the Dalai Lama's wisdom that he is able to explain deep and difficult teachings in a lucid, inspiring manner. The teachings themselves are difficult to grasp and difficult to implement. The Dalai Lama emphasizes that it will do little good simply to read a book and then forget about it. The teachings need to be thought about and put into practice. Each person must work from where he or she is and strive to make progress.<br />Thus this book consists of a single lecture for those who may have little exposure to or interest in the Dalai Lama's teachings and a more detailed treatment for those with further background and interest. Either way, the book may light a spark in the receptive reader's heart.beginning toward breaking out of the unhappy character of impulsive, emotion-driven existence.

The book consists of the text of a lecture series the Dalai Lama gave in London in 1984, before he received the Nobel Prize. The title of the book together with its subtitle &quot;Buddhist perspectives on cause and effect&quot; give some idea of its breadth.<br />The first two lectures in the book, together with Professor Jeffery Hopkins's introduction discuss the fundamental Buddhist doctrine of Dependent Origination. The discussion is based upon an exposition of a famous Tibetan painting of the Wheel of Existence which is beautifully reproduced, in whole and in a number of details following page 40. Turn to the painting before beginning to read the book and refer to it while reading both Hopkins and the Dalai Lama.<br />The Doctrine of Dependent Origination teaches the both the impernanence and interrelationship of things we take in our everyday lives as substantial. It talks about the pervasive effect of ignorance and its immediate consequences, lust and hatred, in poisoning our lives and attitudes. It offers an antidote twoards breaking the wheel of selfishness in the doctrine of non-self.<br />If this sounds obscure, it is. In a famous Sutra in the Pali canon, the Buddha rebukes his disciple Ananda when Ananda thinks he understands the teaching. The Dalai Lama presents the doctrine not as a dispositive treatment, which can't be done, but to stimulate reflection and meditation by the reader.<br />Following the discussion of Dependent Origination, there are almost equally difficult discussions of the Buddhist doctrine of Karma (causality and intentionality) and discussions of specifically Tibetan Tantric practices.<br />Interlaced with the specifically Buddhist doctrinal discussions are discussions of the goal of the doctrines which the Dalai Lama describes (page 34) as &quot;to tame one's mental continuum-- to become nonviolent.&quot; This in turn is divided into two levels: altruism, or helping others, and, perhaps more broadly, doing no harm. According to the Dalai Lama (page 35) &quot;The chief quality of a buddha is great compassion; this is why it is appropriate to take refuge in a buddha.&quot;<br />As always with the Dalai Lama, his goal is to teach and not to convert. He seems somewhat skeptical in this book with the rush of Westerners to adopt Tibetan Buddhism which, he points out, is a form of Buddhism adopted to the specific culture of Tibet rather than to Western culture. Although Tibetan Buddhism does not recognize a creator God, he urges those people comfortable with their own religions to adhere to them as proper sources of spiritual realization and inner peace. For those unable to adopt any religion, (those committed to Western secularism) he urges reflection and self-understanding as a means to end suffering.<br />Similarly, the Dalai Lama emphasizes that the Buddha taught different people in different ways depending on their background and their readiness for religious teachings. Many people, particularly those in the West, must find their path through life in the everyday workaday world rather than mediatating in a forest. The Dalai Lama recognizes and encourages people to work through to their salvation in a way appropriate to and consistent with their individual situation. Wise advice.<br />This is not one of the Dalai Lama's easier books to read. But it will stay with the careful reader. The painting of the Wheel of Dependent Origination is well reproduced, Professor Hopkins's introduction is valuable, and the book has a good bibliography for those wishing to pursue sources further. The teachings may not make the reader a Tibetan Buddhist; indeedmthat is not their intention. They may, however, bring some guidance and insight to the open reader.violent.&quot; This in turn is divided into two levels: altruism, or helping others, and, perhaps more broadly, doing no harm.

I was intrigued and needed to read the book for myself.<br />This book, Barlaam and Iosaph, has long been attributed to St. John of Damascus and was written in about 750 A.D. subsequent to the Nicene Creed (mentioned in the text) and about the time, the editor informs us, of the Iconoclastic Controversy within the Christian Church.<br />The book begins with an introduction which describes a journey of an Apostle to India for purposes of encouraging conversions to Christianity.  A remarkable feature of the story is the clear parallels it has to the life of the Buddha.<br />There was a mighty king, Abener, a pagan who persecuted the Christians.  He had a son, Iosaph.  At his birth, it was predicted he would be either a world ruler or a Christian holy man.  The king sheltered Iosaph in a palace and gave him every pleasure imaginable.  At Iosaph's entreaties, he was allowed to see the palace grounds.  During these sheltered trips, he encountered an old man, a sick man, and a beggar and became aware of the transitory, suffering character of human life.<br />This story, of course, will be familiar to every student of Buddhism.<br />Iosaph is tutored in secret by a Christian ascetic, Barlaam.  After many lengthy discourses on the nature of Christian doctrine, based primarily upon the Hebrew and Christian Bibles and upon Church fathers, Iosaph converts to Christianity.  He is persecuted by his father.  We see a debate between defenders of Christianity and the idolators.  Iosaph is tempted in the flesh by a lovely wanton woman but with the help of God resists the temptation -- with great difficulty.  Abener offers Iosaph one-half his kingdom.  Iosaph accepts and Christianity is spread throughout this land.<br />Abener sees the error of his ways, repents of his persecution of the Christians and of his son, converts to Christianity, and dies redeemed.  Then, Iosaph meets his destiny.  He renounces his kingdom and leaves to assume the life of a mendicant monk in the desert.<br />He is able to find Barlamm and continues under his tutelage until Barlaam's death.  Iosaph renounces his kingship at the age of 25, we are told, and spends 35 years as a monk wandering the desert.<br />There is much Buddhism here but much of early Christianity as well.  The closing scenes of the book, including Iosaphs' renunciation of his kingdom and the description of his life in the desert as a monk, are for me powerful moments, strange as they may be to current sensibilities.  There are also a good many digressions and parables throughout the text that help take the weight from the lengthy expositions of doctrine.<br />This book is one of the earliest in the Loeb Series of the classics.  I didn't know about early Christian awareness of Buddhism and this book showed it to me.  There many books that explore current relationships between Buddhism and Christianity and Judaism.  Here we have it at and early date, and I would love to learn more.<br />This is a tale of the life of the spirit which still has power to move the reader with the power of the religious, ascetic life.Then, Iosaph meets his destiny.

Perhaps it may be of value for those coming to the book for the first time or for those who wish to compare another person's thoughts on the book with their own.  Also, I find writing these notes helps me to understand my own reading.<br />Marcus Aurelius was the Emperor of Rome from 161--180 A.D.  During the years he was absent from Rome leading wars against barbarian invaders, he set down his own thoughts during his moments of repose.  His thoughts were appropriately titled &quot;To Himself&quot;; although they have come down to us under the more usual title of &quot;Meditations&quot;.  Marcus Aurelius never intended the publication of this work.  As C.R. Haines states at the outset of his introduction to his edition:  &quot;It is not known how this small but priceless book of private devotional memoranda came to be preserved for posterity.  But the writer that in it puts away all desire for after-fame has by means of it attained to imperishable remembrance.&quot;<br />I think it is important in the reading of this book to remember that it is Marcus Aurelius communing with himself in his position of Emperor.  The reader will need to understand the book as an exercise in self-reflection to allow the book to work on his or her own capacity for self-reflection.<br />The book is in short, repetitive paragraphs and should not, with the exception of the opening chapter, be read as a discursive, continuous argument.  Because Marcus Aurelius did not intend his reflections for publication, the language sometimes is crabbed and consise and needs effort to read.  This assists in thinking through with the Emperor to the heart of what he has to say.<br />Marcus Aurelius teaches a philosophy that is usually described as stoicism which teaches control of the emotions and the subjection of the passions to what he describes as reason.  For Marcus Aurelius the reason in each person is part of the overriding reason that pervades the cosmos.  Marcus Aurelius teaches restraint, thought, modesty, friendliness and love to all, humility, a counsel against the quest for fame, and bravery and acceptance in the face of sorrow, pain and death. He teaches the need to perform the duties of one's position in life, without regret or complaint or ambition, as Marcus Aurelius himself, as it happened, was called upon to perform the duties of Roman Emperor. His teaching is eclectic and relies on Plato and Heraclitus in particular in addition to his stoic mentors, specifically the Greek slave Epictetus.<br />I read this book when young and it has been many years before I have returned to it.  It is a good book to read in small<br />sections.  I read much of it over several weeks while commuting back and forth on the Metro.  The book also serves to put one's mind in the proper framework and perspective for the world of work.<br />The Loeb edition of this much-translated work is valuable because of its small size, the perceptive introduction by Haines and most importantly because it includes the original Greek on facing pages.  This may seem unnecessary to the many people who would benefit from reading Marcus Aurelius who do not know Greek.  I find it valuable to see and to read the original text in a language which, likewise, I studied briefly many years ago.<br />This is a great and lasting book.

US	48185764	RF29UXJ0DV75O	038548951X	764861011	Sister of My Heart: A Novel	Books	2	25	34	N	N	Judging and Loving	This is a novel about an upper-caste family in Calcutta, India, the Chaterjees, and about two women Sudha, a striking beauty and Anju, relatively plain but intelligent and curious.  The two share the same birthday and grow up together.  Indeed they are inseparable and prefer each others company to the exclusion of others.  They grow up in a society of women (the &quot;mothers&quot;) who try unsuccessfully to provide to them a life sheltered from modernity and its woes.  However, Anju can't be kept from the bookstore her biological mother operates, Sudha can't be kept from the consequences of her beauty, and the two girls growing into adolescence can't be kept from the consequences of simply growing up.<br />The story is told in chapters with each chapter alternating between the voice of Anju and Sudha.<br />The fathers of the two girls disappeared and presumably died before their birth on a wild scheme to find a ruby mine in the jungles of India.<br />Through adolescence and into adulthood, the two become inseparable -- close through the many bad times and the few good times.  Both Anju and Sudha have marriages arranged for them with the mothers concern for their well-being and the downward turn of their families fortunes and health.<br />Sudha stays in Calcutta with her engineer of a husband who is dominated by his mother. In marrying the mother's choice, Sudha forsakes Asoka, her seeming true love whom she met in a movie theater and who wants to marry her. Anju travels to the United States where she pursues, as agreed to by her husband, a college education.<br />The plot of the book is elaborate, with many twists.<br />The plotting of the book is implausible, as are its twists and turns.  It is also full of coincidences which detract from the story and from any sense of characterization or purpose.<br />Partly because of the elaborate nature of the plot, the characterization of Sudha and Anju is, in my opinion, very weak.  They can do no wrong, Sudha with her beauty, Anju with her intellect, and the two of them with their love for each other.  They are products, the author would have us believe, of an Indian society in transition between traditionalism, which the book sees almost exclusively in terms of male domination, and modernity, again described almost exclusively in terms approaching American feminism.<br />In addition to its unconvincing story line and weak characterization, I didn't like this book because of its feminist stereotyping and its judgmental, hostile character to Indian society, (American society as well) and to men.  For most of the book they are portrayed as bullies and bores, concerned only with sex and with using women as objects.  Sudha and Anju, in turn, are presented as pure hearted, as perceptive, and as victims.<br />The portrait is not convincingly done and it is overly obvious.  It made me angry with the book.  There are nuances with the development of the plot but they are insufficient to override the general male-bashing and society-bashing.<br />I tried to think of an appropriate way to express what I found wanting in the book.  Here it is, put simply. There is another Calcutta than that that we are given here and it is the Calcutta of Mother Theresa.  Mother Theresa is reputed to have said &quot;If you judge people, you will have no time to love them.&quot;  Her statement captures much of what I find troublesome in this novel.  For all their love for each other and their thwarted ambitions, Sudha and Anju, and for the most part their novelistic creator, are judgmental and partial to others.  They have no sympathy for India, for men, or for the promise of America either beyond the bounds of a strident feminism.  They view people through the lenses of their own ideas exclusively and can't see others or sympathize with them as others see themselves or as Sudha and Anju themselves wish to be treated.<br />These are the reasons I can't recommend this novel.  I have a hard time imagining a male reading the book with pleasure.  It is a difficult read, ornately plotted, poorly characterized, and written, in my view, in a spirit of undue judgment and criticism.eading the book with pleasure.

Bailyn's approach rejects certain types of other plausible explanations of the Revolution -- such as economic rivalry with the mother country or personal ambition on the part of colonial leaders --to tell his story of the origins of American ideas.<br />Bailyn finds the ideas that shaped the Revolution stated and debated in the ubiquitous pamphlets that appeared in the colonies between, about, 1760 -- 1776.  But the source of the ideas are much deeper.  Bailyn traces these ideas to the ancient Roman orators, through philosophical figures such as Locke and Vattel. The immediate source of the ideas which became America was in dissenting policitical thought in Great Britain in the later Seventeenth and Early Eighteent Century following the Glorious Revolution.  The concern was political corruption in the Britain of the time and the fear that the monarchy would reassert its dominance over British life.  Early in the 18th century, well before the French-Indian War, these concerns found their way to the American colonies and prepared the intellectual groundwork for independence.  The colonists had a real fear that what they perceived as arbitrary British actions would reduce them to slavehood or vassalage.<br />Bailyn discusses in detail how the colonists took English political thought and applied it to the nature of representative government, constitutional thought, and the nature of divided sovereignty.  He then explains how the manner in which the colonists transformed thinking about the nature of government had ramifications in the colonists' view of slavery, the disestablishment of religion, a classless society, and the nature of democracy.  The intellectual transformation required for an independent United States thus occurred well before the Declaration of Independence and the Federalist Papers.<br />Bailyn's book is a work of detailed scholarship and not easy to read.  It is a major achievement of intellectual history and will more than repay the effort.  John Adams is among the major heros of this book.  Readers that want to follow-up McCollough's popular biography and learn about the ideas of the time might well explore this book. Bailyn's study affirms the power of thought and of the American experiment.

There are two recent books with which I am familiar that help correct this situation. The first is Robert Remini's study of Jacksonian American, &quot;Andrew Jackson and his Indian Wars&quot;.  The second is Professor Wallace's book on Jefferson's relationship to the Indians, which I am discussing here.<br />Remini's and Wallace's book can be read together because both tell parts of the same sad story.  Expansionist pressures from settlers and the fear of the United States of Indian attacks, particularly when incited by hostile European nations led to a policy of land cessions, wars, and forced removal westward of the Indian tribes.  The process culminated with Andrew Jackson's Indian wars and presidency, the subject of Remini's book, but it was effectively put in place by Thomas Jefferson, as shown by Wallace.<br />Jefferson and his Indian policy, however, seem to me to present a more complex case than Jackson.  As Wallace's book shows, Jefferson was indeed a polymath, a scholar and intellectual as well as a, paradoxically, man of power and position.  Jefferson took a genuine interest in Indian archaeology, culture and language and made himself or encouraged others to make, scholarly and enthnological contributions that are still important towards understanding the Indians.<br />Jefferson, even on Professor Wallace's account, had compassion for the Indian tribes and an interest in their well-being, even if this interest was overshadowed, as it was, by his desire to obtain Indian land for the new nation and even though his view of Indian interests was misguided and partial.<br />Wallace's book traces Jefferson's early relationship with Indians beginning before the revolution when Jefferson was a land speculator in the then Western United States.  He explores in detail Jefferson's writing on Indians, particularly his writing on the Indian chief Logan in his &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia.&quot;  Jefferson's partial reading of the fate of this &quot;Noble Savage&quot;, according to Wallace, shows the ambivalent character of Jefferson's approach to the Indians.<br />Wallace describes in detail Jefferson the politician approaching Indian affairs in the original United States territory and in the Louisiana purchase, which doubled the size of the United States. The announced goals of the policy were peace, land cessions and civilization for the Indians.  Too often, these policies became simply the means for tribal destruction and deprivation and for the removal policy, for both the southern and the northern tribes, that culminated in the administration of Andrew Jackson. (again, see the Remini book.)<br />There are some fascinating quotations in the book that illustrate Wallace's points that are set aside and emphasized in blocked-type and quotes.  It is a good way of gaining focus.  The book has a wealth of documentation and is not simply a political history.  As I indicated Jefferson was a complex individual and this book shows him, focusing on Indian affairs, in all his personal and political variety.<br />Wallace has a clear feeling for the tragedy of the American Indian.  Yet his book is balanced in tone and does not degenerate into ideological or special pleading. His opinions are stated clearly and eloquently in his introduction and conclusion and in his discussions of the events described in the text. The book has the measure of a scholar and encourages the reader to reflect for him or herself on the record.<br />There are those who are skeptical of the public's recent interest in American History, as shown by the success of McCollough's John Adams as well as other popular historical works, on grounds that it is a new attempt to promote American exceptionalism and to avoid considering the tragedies of our past.  I disagree.  I think, this interest in history shows a renewed love and interest in our country with no desire to minimize its failings.  Wallace's book to me shows both love of our country and a sense of one of its major tragedies.ire to minimize its failings.

This nickname was based upon Jackson's unrelenting warfare against the Creek Indians, particularly at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814.  Professor Remini shows in his careful and thorough study of Jackson and the Indians that the sobriquet was indeed well deserved. The book is a thorough and careful exposition of the cruelties practiced on the Indians during the Jacksonian Era culminating in their removal from their homes and their relocation west of the Mississippi River during and subsequent to Jackson's Presidency.<br />Remini is a master of his materials.  He has written a National Book Award winning biography of Jackson together with many other works on the Jacksonian Era of our history.<br />After a brief introductory chapter summarizing Jackson's early years, Remini plunges into the story of Jackson's Indian wars.  Prior to his Presidency, Jackson conquered the Creeks, Cherokees, Chickasaws and Seminoles in fierce no-quarter fighting.  Jackson was resolute in his wish to remove the Indians from the Southeastern United States.<br />In addition to his leadership on the battlefield, Jackson was a participant in many treaties with the Indians in which the ceded large portions of their ancestral domain in return for small tracts of land and small sums of money.  Here too, Jackson was a domineering, seemingly irresistible figure intent on opening the Southeast to the onrush of white settlement, with little regard for the effect of his actions on the Indians.<br />As a national hero based upon his victory at the Battle of New Orleans and his conquests of the tribes, Jackson narrowly missed the Presidency in 1824 but was elected in 1828 and 1832.  He was able to implement the policy of Indian removal he had conceived in his years as a general and a treaty negotiator.  He secured legislation from Congress authorizing the removal of the &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot; -- the Cherokees, Chickasaws, Creeks, Choctaws, and Seminoles -- and implemented this policy at great cost and suffering to the Tribes.  It is a story all too little known today.<br />Jackson was a man of determination, strength, and will.  He was also, in Remini's account, an American patriot.  Shocking as was his treatment of the Indians, Jackson was moved by considerations of American Nationalism.  In particular, he wished to protect the coastal areas of the United States from intrigue and invasion by England and France.  The European powers tended to use the Indians as a means to threaten the United States.<br />Although he is properly critical of Jackson's cruelty, arrogance, and deceit towards the tribes, and of the horrors they underwent during the removal, Remini argues that there was no good alternative to the removal policy.  If the tribes had not been removed they would have been overwhelmed by onrushing white settlement and lost entirely their tribal identity, as was the case with many northeastern tribes.  Paradoxically, Jackson proved right in that the removal policy saved the southeast tribes from extinction.  Of course, none of this excuses the cruelty with which the process was implemented; and Remini is far from trying to excuse it.<br />I came to Remini's book after reading an earlier study of Jackson and the Indians:  Michael Paul Rogin's book &quot; Fathers and Children: Andrew Jackson and the Subjugation of the American Indian.&quot;  I wasn't entirely happy with the Rogin because of its hypercritical tone and because of its psychologizing.  Remini's book constitutes a more thorough,thoughtful, and balanced consideration of this sad period in our history.

The precise nature of &quot;Imagism&quot; has been much discussed.  Some of the more famous, succinct forumlations of its creed were &quot;Not ideas of the thing but the thing itself.&quot;  and, simply, &quot;make it new&quot;.  Imagism wanted to turn away from late 19th Century poetry with what the new writers perceived as its sometimes stilted diction, involuted syntax, forced rhymes, and forced sentiment and return to the object, to a way of seeing things freshly through precise speech.  In Bob Blaisdell's brief introduction to this book, he discusses the principles of Imagism as Richard Aldington, the first poet to appear in the collection, formulated them:  1.Direct treatment of the subject; 2.As few adjectives as possible; 3. A hardness as of cut stone; 4. Individuality of rhythm; 5. A whole lot of dont's; 6. The exact word.<br />W.C. Williams's poem &quot;To a Solitary Disciple&quot; (page 137 of the collection) offers a good poetic summation of imagist practice.

As biography, the book discusses the young Andrew Jackson, the trauma he underwent by being a posthumous child, and the death of his mother on the American frontier when he was fourteen.  The book then explores Jackson's violent early manhood and his following career as a successful land speculator and local polititican. The book proceeds to examine Jackson's role in the War of 1812 and, most importantly in the Creek  and Seminole Indian Wars. It follows this discussion with a treatment of Indian affairs during Jackson's Presidency as well as with a broader, though shorter discussion, of the nature of Jacksonian democracy and of Jackson's destruction of the Second Bank of the United States.<br />There is some good information and thought in the book. When the book focuses on telling the story of Jackson and his activities, it is good reading and, in the main, does not present an appealing picture of the United States's or Jackson's treatment of the Southeast Indians. Jackson's Indian Wars and subsequent removal policy come in for strong criticism. Rogin has interesting things to say about the conflicted character of American attitudes to the Indians and how these attitudes were both reflected and created by Jackson. It is also interesting to approach Jacksonian democracy from the perspective of Indian affairs. Rogovin's book was among the first to focus on Jackson's Indian policy in an attempt to understand Jacksonian America. Rogovin's judgments both on Jackson and more broadly, on the growth of democracy and industrialization in the United States, seem to me overly harsh.<br />The book is seriously marred by its attempts at psychohistory. There is a lot of second and third hand reliance on works by Freud, Erickson, Melanie Klien and other founders of psychoanalysis and a lengthy, unconvincing, attempt to apply Rogin's understanding of psychoanalysis to Jackson and to the American experience. It didn't work for me, to say the least. The book's overreliance on questionable psychohistory does lead me to be skeptical about much of the argument and conclusion of the book.  The book is good at relating the literature of the day to Jacksonian America with some insightful comments about the work of Herman Melville. (Rogovin has also written a book about Melville).<br />There is something here worth knowing and saying about Jackson.  Our Indian policy was indeed tragic and exacted a great human toll. The book though doesn't appreciate the difficult pressures in foreign and domestic affairs facing a young America.  It is overly angry with the United States and too dependent on questionable psychologizing. The book shouldn' be anybody's sole source of information about Jacksonian America or Indian policy.It didn't work for me, to say the least.

On a closely-related subject, the book also discusses the Union Army's gradual use of African-American soldiers as a means to winning the Civil War.<br />Klingaman focuse on the changes in Lincoln's attitude towards emancipation and his gradual assumption of a strong leadership role.  He also points out that many of Lincoln's decisions were forced upon him by the political and military circumstances of the War. Thus, Klingaman describes how Lincoln's original goal in the War was the preservation of the Union.  He resisted pressure from the Abolitionists and from the Radical Republicans to emancipate the slaves in order to avoid antagonizing the border states and those in the North who would not have fought a war to free the slaves.  As political pressures changed, and as the North suffered setbacks in the Virginia theatre of the war, the pressures on Lincoln changed.  Although the seeds of the Emancipation had been planted earlier, as Klingaman shows, Lincoln used the end Lee's invasion of the North at Antietam as the fulcrum to issue the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation and followed it up with the Proclamation of January 1, 1863.  Klingaman explains well how the issuance of the Proclamation helped change the momentum of the War, militarily, politically, and internationally.<br />This book is not a work of new scholarship but it is valuable and worth reading nonetheless.  Klingaman does a good job of emphasizing both the military and political aspects of the War, while many books concentrate on one or the other. I thought the book had particularly good insights to offer on Lincoln's relationship with Union General George McClellan.<br />Klingaman's Lincoln is primarily a politician and a pragmatist more than a political theorist.  Lincoln's backwoods humor comes through well in the book as does his depression and sadness resulting from the heavy weight of his public and private trials. There are effective descriptions of pre-war Washington, D.C. which are followed by further descriptions of the way the city and our nation changed with the industrialization wrought by the War.<br />There are good textual discussions of both the Prelimary and Final Emancipation Proclamations which emphasize the compromises Lincoln had to make to politics rather than the role of ideas.<br />Finally, the book briefly discusses Emancipation following the conclusion of the War and points out eloquently how much remained and still remains to be done to bring about racial equality.<br />This book is a balanced and thoughtful history of the Emancipation for the reader interested in a seminal moment of our Nation's history.l in the book as does his depression and sadness resulting from the heavy weight of his public and private trials.

The book, and the discussions, went far beyond that topic, however, and centered upon an inter-faith dialogue between the Jewish leaders and the Tibetans on the nature of their religious beliefs and practices.<br /><br />In &#34;Stalking Elijah&#34;, Kammenetz tries to find his way back to a Jewish observance using the insights he had gleaned from his meeting with the Tibetans. In other words, he undertakes a journey from Dhramasala to Judaism. The book recounts Kammenetz's meetings with Jewish spiritual leaders, most of whom practice a form of &#34;mystical&#34; or contemplative Judaism in Kammenetz's attempt to recover something of Judaism for himself.<br /><br />I was frustrated by the book and found it hard to write about it. The book strikes me as self-indulgent and as unduly polemical. Also, Kammenetz's discussions of his meetings with his teachers are superficial. We don't really see enough of the teachers to get a good feeling for what they have to say.<br /><br />The most valuable theme of the book, for me, is given in the title of this review. This is advice given by one of the Rabbi's to whom Kammenetz turns for spiritual advice, an ex-Lubavitcher Rabbi who, like Kammenetz, visited the Dali Lama. In the context of the book, the Rabbi advises the author to begin where he is in life in his search for spiritual enlightenment. Thus, Kammenetz finds he his to work within the scope of his Jewish background and learning, and follow a Jewish path to define and to realize his religious goals. The advice to &#34;start from where you are&#34; is wise, I think, beyond the use to which it is placed here. In every walk of life at every stage, the beginning of wisdom is to &#34;start from where you are&#34; rather than to try to be someone else or to be discontented with one's life. Good rabbinical advice, and good Buddhist advice too.<br /><br />In addition to this component of the book, I found the final chapter describing a Passover seder in Dharamasala attended by Jews and Tibetan Buddhists well written. It can stand alone as an essay.<br /><br />The book is of mixed merit, but its goal and message are valuable.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanalk of life at every stage, the beginning of wisdom is to &#34;start from where you are&#34; rather than to try to be someone else or to be discontented with one's life.

US	48185764	RNS4PPRJFAGA1	0140179062	500247197	Maggie Cassidy	Books	5	4	5	N	N	First Love	Kerouac's autobigraphical novel Maggie Cassidy is set in his hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts in 1939.  It is the story of a high school romance.  There are wonderful descriptive passages of winter in New England, of shabby urban tenements, of grizzled and failed adults, and of hope, love, and loss.<br />The book captures the yearnings of first love in its confusion and undirected passion.  It talks about both how people change and how there are limits to the scope of their change.  The perspective of the book is interesting and revealing.  Kerouac, the grown writer, is recapturing something of the spirit of the first love of his youth.  The story is mostly told in the first person in the voice of the adolescent.  Then, abruptly at the end the voice shifts to the third person signalling, I think, the change from the perspective of youth to that of adulthood.<br />There is something poignant about the book in the description of a memory of pure love which doesn't fade, (think of the Buddy Holly song &quot;Not fade away&quot;) and about the shift from innocence to overt sexuality.  There is a deep conservatism in Kerouac for the familiar, the commonplace, and the local, something which is often overlooked by his critics and admirers alike.  It comes through well in this book.<br />Many writers tend to become prisoners of their most famous books.  In Kerouac's case, people frequently don't get past On the Road. Maggie Cassidy is a book on a smaller, perhaps more conventional scale.  In its own way, it is precious.	2001-09-10

In 1976, Harold Bloom wrote an influential article, &quot;The Sorrows of American-Jewish Poetry&quot; critical of the work of American Jewish poets, such as Charles Reznikoff, for failing to keep alive in their writings the prorphetic, moral character of the Jewish Scriptures.  In 1997, Steve Rubin edited an anthology, Telling and Remembering, containing selections from over thirty Jewish-American poets.<br />With this as a background, Finklestein's book attempts to determine what in American Jewish poetry is significant and why it is so.  He tries to select a number of writers illustrating important trends in Jewish-American poetry and to explain their significance.<br />The result is a challenging book, in places as difficult to follow as some of the poets it discusses, but one that can bring focus to reading.  In my case, the book introduced me to poets I hadn't known about before.<br />Finklestein divides Jewish poets into to groups which basically fall within the broad divide of Twentieth Century American poetry: the objectivists and the symbolists.  The leading objectivist poets are Charles Reznikoff and Louis Zukofsky and their late Twentieth Century successors.  Their writing is spare and fact-based.  As far as Jewish content is concerned, the attitude towards Jewish tradition becomes one primarily of history -- with a loss of traditional religious belief -- and an attempt to make something of this history in one's life as an American.<br />The &quot;symbolist&quot; school is an attempt to continue the romantic tradition in poetry, with ancestors in Blake, Whitman, and, in the Twentieth Century Wallace Stevens.  Finklestein discusses Allen Ginsberg's Kaddish as the representative poem of this movement, even though Ginsberg has strong objectivist components as well, and even though Ginsberg left Judaism and disclaimed any ties to it.  Finlestein also discusses the religious poetry of Alan Grossman and the &quot;Ethnopoetics&quot; of Jerome Rothenberg.  Grossman, in particular, he sees as attempting to bring back a religious dimension to poetry and to American Jewish life.<br />As Finklestein recognizes, generalizations are treacherous.  It is difficult to separate issues particular to Jewish-American poetry from broader issues common to American or contemporary poetry or to isolate issues as particularly bearing upon Jewish-American writers.  In broad terms, though, he finds the writers he discusses have a sense of themselves as American and yet carry forward something of Jewishness.  At the close of his book he alludes to a description by Jerome Rothenberg of Jewish poets as &quot;technicians of the sacred&quot; with one foot in modernity and secular America and the other foot in an attempt to recover something of the Divine and the Transcendent, whether this is viewed in specifically Jewish terms or not.  In addition, he claims to find an underlying sense of affirming the value of life in the poetry.<br />There is a rich body of work produced by Twentieth Century American poets that remains to be discovered.  The work of Jewish Americans forms part of this work.  Some of the writers discussed in this book may be obscure, but the book will encourage the reader to explore further the canon of American-Jewish poetry.iscusses the religious poetry of Alan Grossman and the &quot;Ethnopoetics&quot; of Jerome Rothenberg.

David McCulough's large, epic-scaled biography seeks to correct this omission and to bring the character and achievement of Adams alive for today's reader.<br />McCullough describes well the essential role Adams played in his long life in our Nation's founding.  The stages of Adams career, each filled in their own way with accomplishment, can be divided as follows:  1. early years as a young attorney culminating in his courageous defense of the British militia responsible for the Boston Massacre; 2. ceaseless advocate for American Independence during the First Continental Congress; 3.  Diplomat to France and Holland during the Revolutionary War and American negotiator of the peace treaty; 4.  Diplomat to Britain to negotiate commercial treaties for the fledgling nation 5.  first Vice-President of the United States; 6.  second President of the United States who successfully kept the country out of war with France; 7. retirement in Quincy.<br />Each of these periods of Adams's life is described in detail with good attention paid to giving the reader a feel for time and place.  I thought the descriptions of early Philadelphia and of Paris both before and after the Revolution were well done.<br />McCullough also concentrates on Adams's character.  He emphasizes his honesty and integrity, admitted to even by his opponents, his love of learning, his relationship with his remarkable wife Abigail and his sometimes sad relationships with his children, and his relationship with other leading figures of the time including, of course, Jefferson, Washington, and Franklin and many others.  Adams's vanity, his sharp temper, and his ambition also come through well in the book.<br />For all of Adams's accomplishments, I was most impressed with the final stage of his life following his 1800 loss of the Presidency to Thomas Jefferson.  Adams retired to his farm in Quincy, Massachusetts and devoted himself to reading and to extensive correspondence.  In particular, Adams and Thomas Jefferson effected a reconciliation following the conclusions of their Presidencies and exchanged a remarkable series of letters on their thoughts on government, their political experiences, their reading, and simply on growing older and wiser.  These letters are indeed treasures of American literature and thought.<br />Both Adams and Jefferson died on July 4, 1826, the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, as befitting the stature they have for our country. Virtually on his deathbed, Adams was asked for a toast for the celebration.  He responded with the words that are the title of this review.<br />This is a deservedly poplular book.

Although he studied law, his calling was as a poet.  He became one of the important practitioners, beginnning in about 1918, of a modernistic form of poetry known as objectivism.  This school was heavily influenced by Ezra Pound.  It is difficult to define, but it involves stripping poetry of romantic accretions, forced verse forms, and standardized sentiments.  It has a motto of &quot;to the things themselves&quot; and the emotional response produced from the writing flows from exact description, precise wording, a lack of editorializing, and understatement.  Reznikoff attained a small measure of recognition towards the end of his long life (he died in 1976) and in my opinion is the leading Jewish poet that has written in the United States.<br />Fredman's book is a welcome critical study of Reznikoff.  The book explores the tension that resulted when a first generation American trying to recapture something of his Jewishness came in contact with the spirit of secularity and modernity in Twentieth Century America.  This tension, for Fredman, is at the heart of Reznikoff's poetry.<br />Fredman expands his theme to show how the Jewish immigrants attempted to adjust to their new country by discussing the Menorah Journal.  This periodical was founded by Jewish students at Harvard in 1906 and it became an important magazine publishing Reznikoff's poetry, as well as many other historical and critical articles in which the new immigrants attempted to joint the mainstream of American culture while keeping something of their Jewishness.  Most of these individuals were secular and rejected the religious element of Judaism.<br />Fredman takes the conflict between traditional Jewish belief and modernity back still further with a discussion of Spinoza, the prototypical secular, modern Jew.  He finds that Spinoza articulated a philosophy of immanentism under which God was found by studying the world, rather than through the transcendent source of religious revelation.  Reznikoff, argues Fredman, was a modern heir of Spinoza and the philosophy of immancence.  Many of the issues faced by modern Jews have their roots in Spinoza.<br />Fredman's book includes a good selection and analysis of passages from Reznikoff, emphasizing the Jewish component of his poetry. Other writers tend to emphasize the American nature of Reznikoff's writing, particularly his descriptions of New York City. I was pleased that with the work of this too little known writer, Fredman emphasized some texts that remain to be discovered and brought back into print. He offers a long discussion of Reznikoff's plays, in particular a play dealing with Uriel da Costa, an apostate Jew and a predecessor of Spinoza. Fredman, of course, ties in da Costa's project with Reznikoff's own.<br />This book also offers much in the discussion of intellectual and poetic life in Twentieth Century America. Although Reznikoff has never been and probably never will be a writer with broad mass appeal, his work helps illuminate the United States and the dilemmas faced by the Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe as they assumed their many places in our country.as found by studying the world, rather than through the transcendent source of religious revelation.

In her short life, Lazarus produced an impressive body of poetry, translations, and plays.  In particular she wrote poems on Jewish themes, on pogroms in Europe, and on an incipient Zionism.  She is the first significant Jewish-American poet and is still, I believe, one of the most important.<br />Ms Roth-Young's book is divided into two sections, the first consisting of a biography of Emma Lazarus the second consisting of a selection of her letters discovered and published for the first time by the author. Roth-Young has a knowledge of and affection for her subject. Roth-Young attacks views of Ms Lazarus that had been advaced by earlier writers, creating what she describes as a &quot;myth&quot;.  The &quot;myth&quot; sees Emma Lazarus as a reclusive spinster who discovered her Jewish roots in the early 1880 and changed from a late-Victorian poet with traditional late romantic themes to an ardent poet of Judaism.<br />Because the work and life of Emma Lazarus are so little known, the critique of earlier writers appears overdone.  A straightforward narrative might have been more effective.  Roth-Young's portrait, and the letters, show, indeed a cosmopolitan, highly social Emma Lazarus who travelled twice to Europe in the final years of her life (1885-1887) and appeared more concerned with European culture and art than with recovering her Jewish past.  It remains questionable, however, whether this is the whole story of a life or whether it is as inconsistent with earlier readings of Lazarus's life as Roth-Young believes it is.<br />Lazarus described herself as a recluse; she was sensitive about her unmarried state. A large and varied correspondence does not rebut this self-perception.  The book points to ambivalences in Lazarus's attitute towards Judaism, and this is useful in understanding her work.<br />The book also could have used a fuller discussion of Emma azarus's poetry because, as Roth-Young is aware, it is virtually forgotten today. The forward to the book by Frances Klagsburn suggests that Emma Lazarus's poetry was largely conventional and derivative and that her Jewish poetry suffers from a certain lack of distance and personal involvement.  There is not sufficient discussion of the poetry in the book to convince the reader that this is true.  My own reading of this poetry is that it is a thoughtful and important predecessor of the liberal Judaism of our own day with much to teach us sbout the value of non-fundamentalist religion in a secular world.<br />This book is a good introduction to Emma Lazarus who, I think, deserves the status Ms Roth-Young thinks she already has as something of an American icon due to her association with the Statue of Liberty.  I hope it will encourage the interested reader to search out the works of this too little known American poet.lso could have used a fuller discussion of Emma azarus's poetry because, as Roth-Young is aware, it is virtually forgotten today.

The three main characters are Lin Kong, a doctor in the Chinese Army, Shuyu, his wife through an arranged marriage and the product of a traditionalist upbringing (i.e. with bound feet) and Mannu Wu an educated, mordern nurse that Lin plans to marry.  Under military law, Lin must wait 18 years before he may secure a divorce without the consent of his wife.<br />The story operates on multiple levels.  It is in part a story which explores the nature of love -- what does it mean to love someone and how does one know when he or she is in love?  The story also works as a political allegory of the Communist regime in China.  Closely related to the latter, it is a fable about a traditional way of life coming into contact with modernity and industrialisation (communist or not).<br />On all levels, the story shows the ambiguity of the human heart and the difficulty of self-knowledge.  These are basic difficulties in being human, and their understanding is basic to human love, politics and change.  The story shows both how hard it is for people to know their own hearts and also how difficult it is to pursue any ends without bringing, in some way, harm to another person.<br />The story is told in an eloquent, minimalist prose.  The writing is simple and beautiful.  I found theprimary characters and a host of secondary characters well, if suggestively and sparely, presented and developed.<br />This book reminded me of another highly acclaimed book: Disgrace by J,M. Coetzee.  Both books are written in a restrained prose.  Both are about repressive political societies (South Africa and China) in an uncertain state of transition.  And both present situations fraught with moral ambiguity which seem to point beyond themselves for understanding.<br />This is a thoughtful and sad story about what a party leader accurately describes at an important moment of the book as &quot;a bitter love&quot;.	2001-08-20

Professor Coleman has himself been a practicing Buddhist for fifteen years and brings to the book something of his own understanding of and commitment to Buddhist practice.<br />It is important to understand the scope of Professor Coleman's study and his manner of investigation.  His study of Buddhism in America is limited to those groups in which Americans have attempted to establish their own Buddhist communities based upon their understanding of the three Buddhist traditions that have become most common in the United States: Zen, Tibetan, and Vipassana (Theravada). The focus of American Buddhism, unlike some of its Asian counterparts is on meditation rather than on devotional ritual.  The study thus excludes ethinc Buddhism, which consists predominantly of recent immigrants from Asia (although many Westerners also attend these predominantly immigrant sanghas), and forms of Buddhism such as Pure Land and Soka Gakki which do not emphasize meditiation and which appeal to a somewhat different group of Western practitioners.  After so defining the scope of his study, Professor Coleman explains that he has conducted his investigation by means of an extensive survey (reprinted in the book), by reading the available literature, and by interviews.<br />The book gives a brief history of Buddhism in the United States beginning in the late Nineteenth Century.  Some of this ground was covered in Rick Fields's book &quot;How the Swans Came to the Lake.&quot;  This is followed by one of the clearest brief summaries I have read of the history of Asian Buddhism and of the multiplicity of schools and traditions that confront the American beginning a study of Buddhism.<br />The book then proceeds to discuss practice and beliefs at several prominent sanghas in the United States representing each of the Zen, Tibetan and Vipassana traditions.  Coleman obviously understands his material from the inside, as well as from academic research, and he conveys it well.<br />There is a great deal in the book on the difficulties that Western Buddhism has encountered, many of which are of its own making in the establishment of a new religious approach in the United States.  He describes the conflicts and scandals involving sex and power that plagued much of the American Buddhist community in the 1980s.  He offers his views on the source of these embarrassments as well as opinions on how they may be avoided as Buddhism may continue to develop in our country.<br />Beyond the factual analysis, the best portions of the book are those in the beginning chapter and in the concluding chapters in which Coleman analyses the appeal of Buddhism to the educated, upper-middle class, politically left of center, and generally caucasian individuals that tend to be predominant in the Buddhist movements under consideration.  He offers a multi-level analysis based upon the withering of old class distinctions resulting from democracy, the industrial revolution, and post-modernism. These developments have tended to result in a secularization of society and in an attempt by individuals to attempt to construct an identity, or sense of self for themselves.  It is when a person comes to the view that in searching for selfhood, he or she is acting in a misdirected way that the person may be ready to learn from Buddhism which teaches, as Coleman rightly points out, the absence of a self and identifies the belief in a fixed self as the source of suffering and error.<br />Coleman recognizes the difficulties in the Buddhist transplant to the West, ranging from the problems with new ideas to more mundane matters such as finding the time to meditiate and go on retreat in the face of demanding work lives and family commitments.  He does see Buddhism as having somethingto teach the West and cautiously predicts a continued growth of a distinctly American form of Buddhism.<br />This is a good, thoughtful discussion of Western Buddhism that can be read with benefit by those new to the subject and by those who have been involved with Buddhism for many years.to teach the West and cautiously predicts a continued growth of a distinctly American form of Buddhism.<br />This is a good, thoughtful discussion of Western Buddhism that can be read with benefit by those new to the subject and by those who have been involved with Buddhism for many years.	2001-08-13

The editors believed these outreach and healing efforts by Christians merited &quot;a thoughtful Jewish response&quot; and an attempt by Jewish people to rethink and reconsider their own attitudes to Christianity.  They offered eight statements in an attempt to show common grounds for understanding and respect between Jews and Christians.<br />This book is an outgrowth of the initial statement of September, 2000.  The editiors are part of an organization known as the Institute for Christian and Jewish Studies, an organization composed of both Christian and Jewish scholars, with the goal of promoting Jewish-Christian understanding.<br />The goals of the Statement, the Institute, and this Book are of great importance and worth.  The effort which is undertaken in this book (which, as the editors indicate as hardly a new one)should continue to the benefit of both Jews and Christians.<br />This book is structured essentially as a conversation among Jewish and Christian scholars.  Following the Statement and two introductory essays, the book is organized by topic.  There is an initial essay on the topic by a Jewish writer followed by two essays, one by by a Jewish writer the other by a Christian writer.  The topics chosen for discussion are serious and important for inter-faith understanding and include the Holocaust, concepts of God, Scripture, commandment,  the place of Israel, the nature of prayer, the attitutes of Jews and Christians towards suffering, incarnation, redemption, and sin and repentance.  There is also a discussion of the meanings each faith finds in the Biblical statement that man is created in the image of God.<br />These writers treat theses topics with respect, with humility and with depth.  One can only be awed by the complexity of the teachings included in each tradition and by the learning shown by the participants in this venture.  The essays will teach readers the complexity of the tradition of which they are a part as well as suggesting the overlaps with the sister tradition, the possible agreements, and the core of areas in which Judaism and Christianity simply differ.<br />As would be expected, the essays are not of uniform quality. In some instances, I thought the writers got sidetracked into discussions of matters such as political activism and feminism which, to me, detract and don't add from the questions Jews and Christians need to discuss one to another.  Also, although there is some discussion of Kabbalistic themes in Judaism and attempts to relate these themes to Christianity, the book could have used much more.  I think there is room for discussion of how the contemplative tradition in each faith can work to promote a sense of sharedness.  As it is, the book is deep, thoughtful, but perhaps too (if this is possible) intellectualized.<br />I was particularly impressed with Irving Greenberg's essay &quot;Judaism and Christianity: Covenants of Redemption&quot; and the reponses.  I liked the impression given to Philo's writings as a source of common ground between Jews and Christians in Hindy Naiman's essay.  And I thought Nancy Fuchs-Kreimer's essay &quot;Redemption:What I have Learned from Christians&quot; showed me I had much to learn as well.<br />This is a book that promotes an attitute of understanding and shared respect that has antecendents but still is long overdue.

They are so simple and  true/they must be said without elegance, meter and rhyme,/they  must be laid on the table beside the salt shaker,/the glass of  water, the absence of light gathering/  in the shadows of picture frames, they must be/  naked and alone, they must stand for themselves.&quot;<br />These lines capture many of the themes of this Pulitzer-prize winning book.  The poems in this collection are deceptively simple, &quot;naked and alone&quot;.  They generally involve an incident or person, recollected by the poet from his past. The incident is recounted in bare unrhymed lines, without hyperbole or judgment. We are encouraged to see the incident, as we see the still life reproduced on the cover of the volume and to let it &quot;stand for itself&quot;. The poems are elegaic in tone and the effect of the memory is generally one of deep sadness.<br />Many of the poems have a deliberately pictorial quality, as reflected in their titles, that remind one of a photo or of a  painting in a museum. In many cases, the reader is tempted to conceive in the mind's eye a painting to accompany the poem. This is true, particularly, as the book progresses into its final section with its descriptions of the poet's mother (&quot;My Mother with Purse, the Summer they Murdered the Spanish Poet&quot;), father (&quot;My Father with Cigarette Twelve Years before the Nazis could Break his Heart&quot;), and others (&quot;Edward Lieberman, Entrepreneur, four years after the Burnings on Okinawa&quot;)  One of the poems of the collection is title simply &quot;Photography&quot;.  Ironically, this poem is less pictorial than many others.  It relates a sad incident from the poet's childhood involving his Aunt, and others, and focuses on the ravages of time and memory.<br />The poems also focus on the role imagination plays in constituting our reality.  The first poem of the collection &quot;On the Meeting of Garcia Lorca and Hart Crane&quot; relates a meeting between these two romantic 20th Century poets and alludes to Crane's apparent suicide in jumping from a ship bound from Vera Cruz to New York. Crane's tragic but romantic death is juxtaposed with the vision coming &quot;to an ordinary man staring/ at a filthy river&quot; as he contemplates not only Crane and Lorca but his son falling to his death &quot;from/the roof of a building he works on.&quot;  With a voice of irony, the poet asks us to  &quot;bless the imagination.  It gives/ us the myths we live by.  Let's bless/ the visionary power of the human-- the only animal that's got it--&quot;<br />These poems have a multi-layered simplicity realized through an understated voice of sadness and illuminated by imagination.of the collection &quot;On the Meeting of Garcia Lorca and Hart Crane&quot; relates a meeting between these two romantic 20th Century poets and alludes to Crane's apparent suicide in jumping from a ship bound from Vera Cruz to New York.

It tells the story of Dr. Ben Givens, a renowned heart surgeon who has recently lost his wife, retired, and learned he is suffering from terminal colon cancer. With the goal of saving himself and his family from unnecessary pain and suffering, he sets out with his two dogs on a hunting trip with the intention of committing suicide.<br />This book has strong components of a picaresque novel, with Dr. Givens's adventures in his brief journey, and of an American coming-of-age novel with its protagonist an elderly, successful man rather than a youth struggling to reach maturity. In some ways, this book reminded me of Kerouac's On the Road with an older and wiser hero. Huckleberry Finn for the aging also lurks somewhere in the background<br />In his journey, Dr. Givens has a variety of experiences and meets many different sorts of people emanating from an automobile accident he suffers at the outset. He meets a young couple going sking, a drifter who provides him with marijuana, a graduate student to whom he is briefly attracted who is studying Rudolph Steiner (the founder of an esoteric movement somewhat similar to Theosophy), illegal immigrants picking apples, a young woman veterinarian, and many others. He also recollects during his journey his past life, particularly his loving wife, his wartime experiences and his decision to become a physician.<br />Each of the people he meets along the way has something to teach him towards recovering (or gaining) a degree of self-understanding and acceptance of his condition. I found it striking and good that most of the people are rather ordinary in intelligence and achievement, with something valuable to teach a famous and skilled heart surgeon.<br />The book explores the theme of life as a journey and a quest for self-knowledge for someone with the experience of age. It speaks of the value of this our world, the only world we know. I was reminded of the American poet Wallace Stevens's observation that &quot;The greatest poverty is not to live in a physical world&quot;.  The book celebrates the beauty of the West, the emotional and erotic beauty of women, the beaty of using one's skills to help others, and the beauty of trying to understand oneself. The descriptions are good, and the story is well-told, even though it lacks a certain sparkle. A worthwhile and thoughtful book.ow.

US	48185764	R19NSTZZMURHVV	0375701354	565515974	The Mercy: Poems	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Poignant Memory	Philip Levine was born in Detroit to immigrant Jewish parents.  The adjustment his family made to a new land, together with the poverty of the Depression, has made a deep imprint on his writing.  He worked at a succession of blue-collar jobs before becoming a professor in Fresno, California.  He has received both the National Book award and the Pulitzer Prize for his poetry.<br />In the poems of The Mercy, the poet looks back upon incidents in his life or in the lives of those dear to him.  The title poem describes his mother's journey to the New World on a ship both aptly and ironically named &quot;The Mercy&quot;.  The poet looks back at her voyage, including his own research on it, to recapture the shock of the voyage to a then nine year old girl with no English attempting to find her way in a strange land.  A related poem earlier in the volume describing an immigrant's reaction to the New World is &quot;Reinventing America.&quot; (Perhaps an ironic reference to the reinvention of government theme of the late 1990's)<br />I think the poems are designed to capture, for the poet and the reader, the details of the small moments of life, remembered and recreated. In &quot;Salt and Oil&quot;, one of the fine poems of the collection, Levine describes a process that underlies the theme of memory in the book:<br />&quot;Three young men in dirty work clothes/ on their way home or to a bar/ in the late morning.  This is not/ a photograph, it is a moment/  in the daily life of the world,/ a moment that will pass into the unwritten biography/ of your city or my city/ unless it is frozen in the fine print/  of your eyes.&quot;<br />So Levine etches these moments for us in his poems.<br />There are poems describing the loss of innocence (as in &quot;Flowering Midnight&quot; which mourns &quot;the lost white world we thought was ours for good.&quot;) and poems describing the dissipation, in loneliness even of the lure of sexuality (as in the poem &quot;The Cafe&quot; which describes a bar scene and concludes &quot;the air thickens with smoke, and no one cares/if the two young girls show their thights or their breasts, some nights/the young men along the bar are too tired even to die.&quot;)<br />Levine is no stranger to the power of music.  I found his tribute to Sonny Rollins in &quot;The Unknowable&quot;, particularly moving. (&quot;He is merely a man--/after all--a man who stared for years/into the breathy, unknowable voice/of silence and captured the music.&quot;)<br />The poems are in a restrained free verse, in the manner of a chastened and somber Walt Whitman.  The poetry also reminds me of the earlier Jewish-American poet, Charles Reznikoff, in its telling vignettes of the lives of ordinary people, its emphasis of a moment, in it use of understatement, and in its reluctance to moralize.<br />Memory can bring sadness, wisdom, reflection, but it can also result in hope.  There is no easy optimism in this collection. This collection is etched sharply with individual recollections of a life. It may help the reader share in the process of looking back with understanding, love,  and forbearance.ribes a bar scene and concludes &quot;the air thickens with smoke, and no one cares/if the two young girls show their thights or their breasts, some nights/the young men along the bar are too tired even to die.&quot;)<br />Levine is no stranger to the power of music.

Professor Jaffa asks at the outset what, if anything, differentiates the Southern Secession following the election of Lincoln to the Presidency from the actions of the Colonists in declaring independence from Britain in 1776.  In answering this question, Professor Jaffa offers a discussion of the Jefferson-Adams election of 1800, showing how for the first time in history how a democratic society could resolve severe disagreement through the use of ballots in an election rather than through the use of bullets.<br />Jaffa's history has, I think, these two themes: 1.The Declaration of Independence's statement that &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal&quot; did, indeed, apply for Jefferson and his contemporaries to all people, including the then African-American slaves. 2.  The Declaration of Independence itself created a perpetual union of what had been 13 separate colonies of Britian and made the United States one country rather than a confederation of separate states.<br />Underlying these historical claims is a broader philosophical argument that is even more at the core of the book: Jaffa wants to reject arguments of cultural relativism, historicism, skepticism or other philosophical positions that argue agains the existence of objective moral principles.  He finds that Jefferson correctly viewed the language of his declaration &quot;All men are created equal&quot; as expressing a moral truth based upon &quot;the law of Nature and of Nature's God.&quot;  Jaffa argues for a position based upon Natural Law, in the sense that moral standards are somehow truths independent of human will or of historical circumstances.  His Natural Law theory, as I find it, is drawn from an uneasy confluence of the thought of Locke, Aristotle, and the Bible.<br />The book is less of a chronological historical account than a textual analysis and commentary on the speeches and writings of thinkers and politicians in Civil War America.  Professor Jaffa offers a paragraph-by-paragraph analysis of Lincoln's First Inauguaral Address and of his July 4, 1861 message to Congress following the outbreak of hostilites.  His approach is less on the pragmatic conduct of the government (although that is discussed as well) than on Lincoln as a thinker expressing what Jaffa sees as a commitment to Natural Law and the the inalienable nature of the Union which Lincoln strove to preserve.<br />Lincoln's thought is compared and contrasted, in almost as great detail, with speeches by James Buchanan, Alexander Stephens, Jefferson Davis, Stephen Douglas and John Calhoun.  These individuals are shown to reject the principles of Natural Law that Professor Jaffa finds articulated in the Declaration of Independence and by Lincoln.  Their though is compared rather explicitly by Professor Jaffa to academic modernism and skepticism regarding the objective character of moral principle.<br />There are fascinating discussions of Shakespeare's histories, Aristotle, and, particularly the &quot;Federalist&quot; and the works of Thomas Jefferson.  In contrast to many modern historians, Jaffa sees Lincoln in the Gettysburg address as reaffirming the position of Thomas Jefferson rather than as effecting a change in the nature of the American ideal.<br />This is a difficult, thoughtful,challenging book.  It is more of value for its philosophical outlook and challenge than for any addition to the store of historical knowledge.  For those who want to think about the philosophical bases for our institutions, this book is highly worthwhile.  It is a different sort of successor, but a worthy successor, to Professor Jaffa's study of the Lincoln-Douglas debates.lenging book.

A major instance of a contemporary poet whose writing deserves attention from a wider readership is Philip Levine.  His book, &quot;What Work Is&quot; won the National Book Award for poetry in 1991.  He has produced an impressive quantity of poetry which, in its very restraint and poignancy, can help bring meaning to people.<br />This is a short collection, consisting of four untitled sections.  Section III consists of a single extended poem, &quot;Burning&quot; which is broadly autobiographical in character.  The remaining three sections consist of a number of short poems with essentially two themes:  the lives of the working poor prior to WWII and Levine's experiences as a boy growing up in Detroit.  The poems with these themes overlap and are interspersed throughout the book with the earlier sections emphasizing vignettes of individuals doing the ordinary, desultory jobs that are the lot of most of us (such as &quot;Coming Close&quot;, &quot;Fire&quot;, &quot;Every Blessed Day&quot; and &quot;What Work Is&quot;) while the latter section emphasizes Levine's Detroit experiences, the toughness of being a kid, his relationship with his brother, his love of boxing, and his exposure to Anti-Semitism. (&quot;Coming of Age in Michigan&quot;, &quot;The Right Cross&quot;, &quot;The Sweetness of Bobby Hefka&quot; &quot;On the River&quot;.)<br />The poems are lucidly written with understatement and a lack of sentimentality which underscores the emotions and the passions they contain.  It might be useful to compare these poems to the work of three other writers.<br />First, the poems reminded me of Walt Whitman, in their compassion for an attempt to understand the American worker.  They lack Whitman's bravura and optimism, however, and content themselves with painting harshness and with emphasizing the tenacity people need to get by.<br />A writer with somewhat similar themes to Levine is the under-appreciated Victorian novelist, George Gissing in his books of lower class life in Victorian London such as The Nether World.  Levine has a similar sort of attraction to the life of the poor, the unsuccessful and the down and out.  He has at once a sympathy for his characters and a distance from them that Gissing seems to lack, for all his portrayals and descriptions.<br />A third writer is the late poet-nnovelist Charles Bukowski, a favorite of &quot;underground&quot; readers.  Bukowski writes of ne'r do wells, prostitutes, and drunkards, -- as well as doing a lot of writing about himself.  Levine has some of the same attraction to the scorned of society, but his people are the working poor, and their stories are told with restraint and dignity, unlike those of Bukowski, and also unlike the work of Bukowski, with literary skill and grace.<br />This is a book of poetry that has both the sadness and the grittiness of life and the toughness to understand and surmount it.er with somewhat similar themes to Levine is the under-appreciated Victorian novelist, George Gissing in his books of lower class life in Victorian London such as The Nether World.

In Beethoven's case,  his music remains a stunning achievement.  His achievement as a composer, together with the nature of his character, his deafness, his thwarted love affairs, and his relationships to his musical predecessors and successors, has led to a fascination with him and to a literature that is likely to be written and rewritten as long as people listen to his music. As is Beethoven's music, and is is history, Beethoven's life and character, and the means by which one is to understand them, are open to a multitude of approaches.<br />In his Preface, Cooper writes (at x) that &quot;surprisingly little is known for certain about Beethoven.&quot; He points out that some studies, such as Maynard Solomon's fine biography that appeared shortly before Cooper's own, featured a psychoanalytical approach to Beethoven that attempted a fuller explanation of Beethoven's character than those that had been attempted by other writers at the cost of questionable psychological theory and speculation in the face of a scarcity of evidence.  Cooper endeavors to write a biography that holds closer to the known facts about Beethoven's life and to emphasize those facts that may shed life on his activities as a composer.<br />Cooper also spends a great deal of his book analysing the music itself.  There are lengthy accounts of the origins of the symphonies, concertos, quartets, sonatas,songs, masses, of Fidelio, of the folksongs and other parts of Beethoven's output.  There are generous musical analyses and quotations.  I was particularly impressed with Cooper's attention to some of Beethoven's work that is not as well known as it deserves to be, such as the Opus 7 piano sonata, the Creatures of Prometheus Ballet, and the oratorio, Christ on the Mount of Olives.  These works are analyzed insightfully and lovingly.<br />As Cooper acknowledges, his study is perhaps less detailed than is Solomon's on Beethoven's life.  His book does, however, offer its own perspective on Beethoven.  Broadly speaking, Cooper is more sympathetic to certain aspects of Beethoven's actions than has been the case with many other writers.  Unlike Solomon, Cooper takes Beethoven's side, for the most, part, in his dispute with his sister-in-law over the custody of Karl, Beethoven's nephew.  Also, he disputes Solomon's account that Beethoven frequented prostitutes.  In both these matters, I am not sure that Cooper has the better of the evidence.  The portrayal endeavors to see Beethoven favorably without making him something different than a human being with fallibilities.<br />I also found interesting Cooper's discussion of Beethoven's religious views.  Beethoven's views on such matters, as is the case with the views of any thinking person on these matters, were highly personal and difficult for a third party, such as a biographer writing 250 years after the fact, to ascertain and expound. Cooper acknowledges that Beethoven was not for most of his life a practicing Christian but finds him a devout believer in God as the source of human morality.  Solomon's account emphasizes more Beethoven's predilection towards the Enlightenment.  A difficult question, and I suspect that Beethoven had components of both views in him.<br />Too many recent biographers feel a need to deprecate their subjects.  This is definitely not Cooper's approach to Beethoven. (For that matter, it was not Solomon's approach either.) Cooper writes of Beethoven that &quot;despite much sniping from twentieth-century critics, his reputation as a giant among composers remains intact as we enter the twenty-first century.&quot; (Preface x)<br />This book is not hero-worship but it presents an inspiring and historically plausible account of a composer and a man who is worthy to be revered for his vision, attainments and character.

US	48185764	R1CGQTYQEURJE0	0722540302	342384006	Transforming the Mind	Books	5	58	59	N	N	A Wise Teacher for Our Times	This book is based upon a series of lectures given by H.H. the Dali Lama in London in 1999.  The theme of the book is the attainment of human happiness through self-understanding, introspection and, as the title states, &quot;Trasnforming the Mind.&quot;<br />The theme of this book is similar to a book called &quot;The Art of Happiness&quot; that recounts an American psychiatrist's conversations with the Dali Lama.  The analysis in this book, however, is deeper and more difficult.  The Dali Lama discusses Buddhist beliefs amd doctrines as well as Tibetan texts.  He presents a considerable treatment of a difficult, and fundamental Buddhist principle called &quot;Dependent Origination.&quot; He discusses the nature of human selfhood and compares differences in various schools on this difficult topic.<br />The purpose of the book is humanistic and pragmatic at its core: it is to encourage the reader on a path to overcome suffering through self-understanding and reflection.  He offers two broad, interlocked paths towards inner transformation: altruism, or the attempt to bring benefits and good to other people rather than thinking solely of oneself and insight into the nature of reality, to be gained by introspection.<br />The means by which the Dali Lama presents his teaching are at least as significant as the substance of his message.  Difficult teachings are presented with the simplicity that comes only from knowledge.  The Dali Lama is candid and self-effacing: he reiterates many times that he has himself no personal experience of the state of emptiness that that constitutes full realization of insight meditation.  Again and again he points out that religious people of whatever denomination can find their way to peace through following their own traditions.  Futher, those individuals with a secular outlook can also find peace by understanding themselves.  One of the most interesting parts of the book is the question and answer sessions where the Dali Lama offers succinct and insightful answers to good questions.<br />I enjoyed learning about the different schools of thought within Mahayana Buddhism.  The Dali Lama discusses early Buddhist thinkers of the Mahayana school, particularly Nagarjuna and Shantideva and I was pleased to learn something of what he had to say about specifically Buddhist thinkers.  Also, the book includes a short Tibetan text called &quot;Eight Verses on Transforming the Mind&quot; and a commentary by the Dali Lama.<br />Some of this book is presented in a deceptively simple manner. The Dali Lama observes that &quot;personal experience&quot; (p.24) rather than mere book reading is required to understand the nature of consciousness and of awareness.  He also encourages the reader to press on, not to become discouraged and to realize that the growth of wisdom takes lifetimes to develop, not minutes, hours, or months.<br />I found this book valuable both for its teachings on Buddhism and for its more general advice on attaining peace and happiness in one's life.  There is much in the book of healing and hope, for secular people, for followers of non-Buddhist religions, and for people who are students of the Buddha.cinct and insightful answers to good questions.<br />I enjoyed learning about the different schools of thought within Mahayana Buddhism.

Jewish-American poets have been celebrated in two recent anthologies: Telling and Remembring edited by Rubin and Jewish-American Poetry edited by Barron and Sellinger.  Ever since Emma Lazarus, writing in the late 19th Century, the poetry written by American Jewish women have played a large part in this literature.<br />Marge Piercy may well be the best of the Jewish-American poets writing today.  Her work is featured prominently in both the Rubin and the Barron and Sellinger anthologies with the latter collection including an essay as well.  Both anthologies draw heavily from Ms. Piercy's &quot;The Art of Blessing the Day&quot; which prompted me to explore the entire volume.<br />The book as written, the dedication states, &quot;for all who may find here poems that speak to their identity, their history, their desire for ritual -- ritual that may work for them&quot;.  The collection is, indeed, specifically Jewish  but its themes transcend any particular religious commitment and reach out to those who seek themselves in a spiritual path.  The broad theme of the book is announced in the title poem (from which I have taken the title of this review) as &quot;to taste/each moment, the bitter, the sour, the sweet/ and the salty, and be glad for what does not hurt.&quot;  Again &quot;Bless whatever you can/with eyes and hands and tongue.  If you/can't bless it, get ready to make it new.&quot;<br />I was struck by the unity of the collection.  Unlike most books of poetry where the reader may pick and choose among poems, this collection is best read as an integral whole from beginning to end.  The unity of the collection is particularly impressive because many of the poems had been published earlier in a variety of places.<br />The book is divided into six sections with themes running cross-currently.  The opening section, &quot;Family&quot; describes the poets difficult relationship with her mother and her loving relationship with her old-world grandmother.  The section on her marriage was for me the most beautiful of the book with its celebration of erotic, physical and spiritual love.  My favorite poem in the third section, &quot;repair of the world&quot; is the poem &quot;to be of use&quot; which celebrates the value of the world of work. (too infrequently praised).  The next section is titled &quot;Of history and Interpretation&quot;, explores women's issues and the Holocaust, as seen from the eyes of an American, among other themes.  The final two sections &quot;Prayer&quot; and &quot;The Year&quot; are based respectively on the daily liturgy used in Judaism and on the yearly cycle of the Jewish holidays including the New Year, the Day of Atonement and Passover.  Her versions of the traditional prayers I found insightful and eloquent.<br />Ms Piercy writes beautifully, with elegance and understatement.  Her poetry, with its reflections on the past and on nature and on her surroundings is informed by love rather than anger and by an effort to understand.  It is a book that may be turned to repeatedly and thought about over time.<br />Poetry is an underappreciated art in America, even though many of our writers have shown high achievement.  This book is one woman's contribution to the form.difficult relationship with her mother and her loving relationship with her old-world grandmother.

US	48185764	R3W590CNFLOD4M	0374199639	64824201	The Metaphysical Club : A Story of Ideas in America	Books	5	97	106	N	N	How Ideas Matter in America	This is a rare book with ambitions to be scholarly and popular at the same time.  On one level it is more successful as a popular exposition of complex ideas and thinkers.  On another level, however, it succeeds both ways because it awakes in the reader an appreciation of the scope of intellectual life in the United States and a desire to understand and to perpetuate it.<br />The key figures in the book are the great American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes, and the philosophers William James, Charles Pierce, and John Dewey. They were the basic American practicioners of, roughly speaking, a philosophy called pragmatism, which teaches that ideas are tools to be used to accomplish a purpose rather than abstractions which mirror to greater or lesser accuracy some independent reality.<br />Menand examines each figure in light of his family life (Holmes, James, and Pierce all were products, in their different ways, of homes were ideas mattered; Dewey perhaps less so),  temprament, reading, and educational and cultural background.  He places a great deal of emphasis on the American Civil War as a basis, with his protagonists, for rejecting absolutistic views of principle and reality.  An uncompromising commitment to absolutes led, for post Civil War thinkers, to the War and its carnage.  This is an important historical claim and it works very well in the case of Oliver Wendell Holmes.  I am not sure how convincing it is as an explanation of the thought of the other three figures.  William James wrote an important essay &quot;The Moral Equivalent of War&quot; unmentioned in Menand's book, which talks about the apparent inability of modern life to find values to move the heart and spririt as the heart and spririt were moved in the passion of war.  In other words, James, at least, was searching for values, and perhaps even for absolutes, rather than expressing a skepticism towards them.<br />In addition to placing pragmatism in the context of the post Civil War era, Menand places great emphasis on the development of modern science, particularly Darwin's theory of evolution and statistical theory.  These developments, for Menand, tended to discourage a view of the universe as fixed, rational, and purposeful.  Knowledge became tied closely to theories of statistical generalization and theory of error, with an emphasis on what worked.  Scientific theory in fact gets a larger place in the book than does the Civil War as a basis for the development of pragmatism and I think deservedly so.<br />Menand stresses how intellectual development in the United States was tied to racial theories and to other theories such as spiritualism that we find markedly out of place today.  This is not a new story, but it is well told  and does show something important about how ideas we value can emanate from teachings we would reject or find strange.<br />In addition to the four primary figures, Menand discusses a host of other philosophers and thinkers, predecessors, successors, and colleagues to Holmes, James, Pierce, and Dewey. The title of the book is based on an almost legendary &quot;Metaphysical Club&quot; that met all to briefly in the 1870's under the auspices of Chauncey Wright, the &quot;Cambridge Socrates&quot;.  Ideas and intellectual life flourish briefly and quietly, but they may illuminate people's lives for times to come.<br />The book is chatty in tone with many disgressions on matters such as the Dartmouth College Supreme Court case, the Pullman Strike, Jane Addams and Hull House, and Louis Agassiz's expedition to Brazil.  The digressions make it hard at times to keep to the thread of the narrative, but they do cast light on the era and on the development of thought in the United States.<br />As suggested earlier, the book does not expound in detail the thought of its principal characters.  For that the reader will need to turn to texts, and the book encourages him or her to do just that. Menand is not overly critical or analytical about the success of pragmatism.  He points out that the later Civil Rights Movement in America could not have succeeded with pragmatism as a base but rather required a commitment to principle and absolutes found more in other writers.<br />Pragmatism is a distinctive achievement of thinkers in the United States.  This book teaches about it well and, perhaps not entirely consistent with the theory of pragmatism itself, promotes respect for the role of ideas in our country and for the value of the life of the mind.success of pragmatism.

It looked intriguing, and I read it.  (In fact, the author says his book was written for for, among others, such a reader.)  To be more specific, I am interested in religion and in the relationship between early Christianity and Judaism.  I am Jewish and have heard something of what Judaism has to say about the relationship between the two religions.  I haven't read much in depth about it and, even more unfortunately, haven't really listened to what Christian scholars might have to say on the subject.<br />Griffith-Jones's book did have something of what I wanted.  The book considers each of the New Testament Gospels, together with other books of the New Testament, chiefly Acts and Revelation.  Interspersed with each discussion is a historical section which considers Roman, Jewish and Christian sources discussing the period and place which Griffith Jones associates with each Gospel.<br />There is a great deal in the book about the interplay between early Christianity and the synagogue.  Griffifth-Jones does a good job, I think, in describing the Second Temple and its practices, the calamity of its destruction by the Romans 30 years or so after the life of Jesus, and the difficulties faced by the early Christians.  There is also good discussion of the dynamics between the church and synagogue, with some peoplein the synagogue opting to follow Jesus, others being ambivalent and uncertain, and others, and the synagogue as a whole, declining to do so. This is interesting and valuable and I would like to know more.  The appeal of Christianity is, understandably enough, explained by the author.  This is what I wanted to hear, but I also would like to hear the Jewish side.<br />There is also a good discussion of the decision the early Christians had to make about whether there message was primarily directed to Judaism or whether the message was world-encompassing with a mission and message for non-Jews as well.  This is important and insightful, as far as both religions are concerned and Griffith-Jones discusses it well.<br />Although it is not the focus of the book, there is much here that Christians and Jews can share and discuss in an attempt to better understand each other.  This is valuable and I learned something from hearing it from an informed and obviously deeply Christian voice.<br />The textual interpretations of the Gospels are interesting in themselves, if something too long and not well organized. As one would expect, they are more evangelical and religious in tone than the historical discussion. In some instances, I am not sure how the historical information the author presents informs or illuminates his reading of his Gospel.  He doesn't always explain the connection well.  Bythe time the author gets to the Gospel of John, the connection, at least for me, was almost entirely lost.<br />I found the discussions of the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke more illuminating, as to their purpose and audience, that the author's discussions of Mark and John.<br />The book is long and challenging to read.  Although written for laypersons, it is difficult.  There is a lot of repitition.  This was probably done to allow the reader to keep track of what is being said, but too often it gets in the way.  Stylistically the book is uneven.<br />This book will require effort to read.  It did teach me something of what I wanted to know and helped me understand and appreciate the relationship between Judaism and Christianity.

She won the National Book Award in 1974 and received a MacArthur Fellowship in 1994.  Her book, &quot;The Fact of a Doorframe&quot; consists of a selection she has made from her first nine volumes of poetry written between 1950 and 1983.<br />I found it interesting to read this book in sequence (from cover to cover) to see the development of Ms Rich's themes as a poet.  The early collections, through the mid-1960s, focus on descriptions of nature and on Rich's unhappy marriage experience.  For the most part, the poetry is in traditional verse forms  There is a concreteness and an accessiblity to them that will carry over into Ms. Rich's later work.  I enjoyed the the early poem &quot;At a Bach Concert&quot; (several of Rich's poems feature her reflections on music) and her 1960 poem &quot;Propsective Immigrants Please Note&quot;  This poem basically is a commentary on Emma Lazarus's poem, &quot;The New Collussus&quot;  America itself, for Rich, makes no promises. She writes:  &quot;The door itself/makes no promises./It is only a door.&quot;<br />In the middle portions of the book, the poems become more overtly political and polemical in character.  There are sharp criticisms of the War in Vietnam, of the Cold War, of the treatment of Native Americans in the United States, and of environmental desecration. This tendency in Ms Rich's poetry appears, as far as I can tell, somewhat before her focus on womens' issues and on same-sex sexual relationships. The poetry remains predominantly traditional in format although it becomes more experimental and stylistaclly free.  It is didactic and clear to read.<br />The poetry begins to speak distinctly of womens' issues and of lesbian relationships in the collections of the late 1960s.  The poems are sometimes sharp in tone, rejecting of men in many instances, and celebrate the commradeship and shared experiences of women and the tenderness that Rich finds in same-sex sexual experiences.  The emphasis on mostly left political activism also continues.  I found impressive Rich's long sonnet sequence &quot;Twenty-One Love Poems&quot; and the poem &quot;A Woman Dead in her Forties&quot;  from the 1978 collection &quot;A Dream of a Common Language.  I also enjoyed her tribute to the Novelist Ellen Glasgow, in a late poem in the collection, &quot;The Education of a Novelist.&quot; I enjoyed her poem on Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, much as I love that work (Ms Rich does not), and her two translations from the Yiddish poet Kadia Molodowsky.  Ms Rich's poetic voice is not limited to feminist issues.<br />I think this is a good collection to get to understand the work of Ms. Rich.  It works better than a poem or two in an anthology.  In addition,as good poetry will do, the collection allows the reader to trace the development of the thoughts and feelings of some people in our country at a particular time in its poetry.  Rich's poetry is a good bellweather of its age. The poetry has an earthiness an immediateness and an accesibility that will make it worth reading even for those who shy away from modern poetry.hat Rich finds in same-sex sexual experiences.

US	48185764	R3KGTZ8Y6ONZ5T	0807059110	993568779	A Buddhist Bible	Books	5	66	67	N	N	Buddhist Texts in America	Dwight Goddard's collection of Buddhist Sutras and related texts, first published in 1932, is available in paperback with introductions by Robert Aitken and Houston Smith.  The importance of this book lies in its role in the development of American Buddhism as well as, of course, in the texts themselves.<br />Dwight Goddard, according to Aitken's introduction, was an enigmatic figure with training first as an engineer (where he became wealthy as a result of an invention) and as a Christian minister.  In the latter role, he travelled to the East and became interested in Eastern Religions -- a seeker in the true sense of the term.  In the 1930s, while in his 60s he produced this collection of texts, many of which he translated himself, which give a broad view of the nature of the teachings of Buddhist schools.  The book helped teach Buddhism to Americans beginning in the 1930s.<br />In the 1950s, Jack Kerouac, then living in San Jose, California discovered Goddard in the public library.  He carried the book with him wherever he went and used it as the basis of whatever knowledge of Buddhism he had.  The beats in the 1950s were one of the sources leading to the growth of American Buddhism, and Goddard's book was Kerouac's teacher.<br />The main value of this book, though, is not in its role in Buddhist History in the United States but lies in the texts themselves.  Goddard presents in one volume a selection of primary source materials from the Theravada, Manayana, Zen, Tibetan, and and other Buddhist traditions.  Many of these texts have been more recently translated, but the translations in this book are readable, at the least and they are all in one volume. They are not easy reading and will require many rereadings, but they do present a compliation of basic Buddhist materials for those wishing to benefit from them.  My own familiarity with Buddhist texts is primarily with the earlier texts in Theravada Buddhism.  This book is comparatively light on Theravada texts but gave me the opportunity to read the texts of other Buddhist Schools.<br />This is a very fine anthology and is of historical interest for the transmission of the Buddha's teaching to the United States. I have found that many people interested in Buddhism restrict themselves to the practice of meditation or to books setting out Buddhist teachings rather than availing themselves of the original source materials.  This book is a great way to read the original texts.  There will be something of meaning in them for you.but gave me the opportunity to read the texts of other Buddhist Schools.<br />This is a very fine anthology and is of historical interest for the transmission of the Buddha's teaching to the United States.

I knew very little about Australia and thought the best way to get some brief but non-superficial background would be to learn something of its history.  I opted to read Robert Hughes's book which tells the story of Australia's founding and of its convict past.  The book is lengthy, even too lengthy to complete on the 14 hour flights from the West Coast of the United States to Sydney and back.  But the story was fascinating, and the book was well worth the attention and effort.<br />Hughes tells the story of the discovery of Australia, the decision of Great Britain to &quot;transport&quot; its convicted to the continent, the various kinds of lives the convicts found there, the aboriginal settlers and their treatment by the newcomers, and the ultimate creation of a new society. There are harrowing accounts of the passage from Britain to Australia in the convict ships, and still shocking accounts of the secondary places of punishment created in Australia for repeat offenders -- places such as Norfolk Island, Port Aurthur, and Macquarrie Bay. Hughes describes these nineteenth century camps as precursors of the Gulag in our own time, and I am afraid he is correct.  They reminded me to of Andersonville Prison in our own Civil War but on a much broader, more wicked scale.  The description of the prisons and barbaric punishments were to me the most vivid portions of the book.<br />Besides the horror stories, there is a great deal of nuanced, thoughtful writing in the book about the settlement and building of Australia and of the dangers of facile over-generalization about how the convicts fared, or about virtually any other historical subject.  Some were able to serve out their sentences and rise to prosperity and a new life.  Others were shamefully abused.  The history of the aboriginal peoples too is described and it is an unhappy subject, alas.<br />Hughes begins with the early days of the transport and concludes when the system was finally abolished in the 1850's as a result of protests and of the Australian gold rush.<br />After reading this book, I thought I had realized my goal of learning something of Australia.  More importantly, I felt part of the land even though I hadn't seen it before and will likely never see it again.  Places that I read about and that were only names took on character and importance.<br />I have read a substantial amount of United States history but hadn't read about Australia before.  This book is well-documented, eloquently written and has a feel for the pulse of its subject.  It is an outstanding work of history and is sure to broaden the human perspective of the reader.early days of the transport and concludes when the system was finally abolished in the 1850's as a result of protests and of the Australian gold rush.<br />After reading this book, I thought I had realized my goal of learning something of Australia.

I was prompted to think about Augustine and to revisit my old review after reading Augustine scholar Peter Brown's highly laudatory review in the October 26, 2017, &#34;New York Review of Books&#34; of Susan Ruden's new translation of Augustine's &#34;Confessions&#34; published by Modern Library. As I read Brown's review, Ruden's translation attempts to bring the reader closer to the Augustine of his own day, and to the feeling of God as a Master, rather than to read Augustine in the light of modern liberal theology, as I recall Wills tends to do. I learned from Brown's review and hope to have the opportunity to read Ruden's translation. Brown made me think about what I had said in 2001 about Wills and about Augustine. The remainder of this review consists of an edited version of my 2001 Amazon review of Wills' book.<br /><br />I read this book by Garry Wills after reading E.L. Doctorow's novel, &#34;City of God&#34;. I wanted to learn more about Augustine and to think further about the obvious allusion in Doctorow's title, and throughout his book. I had read Augustine before, and was not a total newcomer to his thought. But I needed a refresher and something that would expand my limited understanding.<br /><br />Wills's book is short, clearly written, and presents in an accessible form something of the nature of this complex person, thinker, and theologian. But the book is no mere introduction. It in many ways takes issue with other accounts of Augustine and presents him in a manner that shows why he is worthy of the attention of the modern reader, as he has been of readers throughout the ages.<br /><br />Wills spends a great deal of space arguing that the title &#34;Confessions&#34; for Augustine's most famous work is inappropriate and retitles the book &#34;Testimony&#34;. Wills's point has been made many times before, but in the process Wills does teach the reader something about the book. The work is not primarily a confession or an autobiography but a record of a spiritual search. Wills also argues that Augustine was not a sexual libertine in his youth and, actually more importantly for the modern reader, that he was not anti-sexual in his old age. He presents a Christianity that does not despise the body (making the simple point that in Christianity God came to the earth in a body) and that Christianity teaches its adherents to use the body for God's purpose in humility and love. In fact, Wills presents Augustine as correcting the anti-physical bias of pagan ascetics of his day.<br /><br />In addition to discussion the &#34;Confessions&#34; Wills has valuable things to say about the &#34;City of God&#34;. Again, Wills argues against an other-worldly interpretation of the &#34;City of God&#34; and finds Augustine willing to bring the City to earth in a world believers share with nonbelievers through an early form of toleration, through love, and through common purpose.<br /><br />There is a good, if necessarily brief, description in the book of the closing days of the Roman Empire. This history is in itself worth reading and I had known little about it.<br /><br />I think somebody coming to Augustine for the first time could benefit from the book and be encouraged to think and learn more. I found it useful. I think Penguin is to be commended for its biographical series, making important lives accessible to modern readers in brief, but not superficial texts.<br /><br />Robin FriedmanCity of God and finds Augustine willing to bring the City to earth in a world believers share with nonbelievers through an early form of toleration, through love, and through common purpose.<br />There is a good, if necesarily brief, description in the book of the closing days of the Roman Empire.

I knew the book was the product of an American psychiatrist, Dr. Cutler, rather than an actual text writtin by the Dalai Lama. In fact, the book is based upon a series of interviews between Dr. Cutler and the Dalai Lama over several years in the United States and In Dharmasala, India, the home of the Tibetan Govenment in exile.<br /><br />In addition to my doubts about the authenticity of the book, I also feared the book would be a self-help book, sometimes referred to under the rubric a \\"feel good\\" book.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised.  The book speaks in simple terms but it is far from superficial.  The character and the teaching of the Dalai Lama, I think, come through its pages even though it is the author who is recounting the Dalai Lama's teachings from his notes and even though the Dalai Lama's interpreter, not the Dalai Lama himself, reviewed the final product. The Dalai Lama comes through as a wise, thoughtful but simple monk with a sense of humor, modesty, and self-effacement.  His simplicity, and his ability to relate to people of different backgrounds and religious traditions, are the mark of wisdom, coming from a spiritual leader who is all to often in the glare of the public limelight and who of necessity functions as a political leader as well.<br /><br />The Dalai Lama presents teachings on the nature of the human heart -- it is essentially pure and good -- the desires and angers and ignorance which present us from realizing goodness and happiness- and teachings and methods to ease the path to happiness.  Although the teachings are presented simply, no claim is made that the realization is simple.  There are teachings on romantic love which may not appeal to Westerners (the Dalai Lama finds it essentially selfish), but much good material on the psychology of the mind and emotions, controlling negative tendencies, the universal nature of the human heart, and most importantly, trying to conduct oneself to DO NO HARM to anyone else.<br /><br />The tone of the book is mostly psychological with very little of the specific teachings of Tibetan Buddhism.<br /><br />I thought the final chapter on spritual development was the most valuable and eloquent portion of the book.  The Dalai Lama talks about the different creeds, Eastern and Western, that he had come to know with his exile from Tibet.  He finds that believers in these religions, regardless of how different they may appear on the surface, can find peace and happiness by following their teachings.  For those unable to believe, a secular philosophy can likewise lead to peace and happiness through learning to control the mind.<br /><br />Very simple and profound teachings from a person who is indeed a wise teacher for our times.else.

And question Phillips does, in cafes, bookstores, prisons, schools for at risk children, old-age homes, and anywhere else he can find people who are willing to question and discuss.<br />It is only late in the book that we learn some of the &quot;why&quot; of Phillips' own quest-  how he grew disatisfied with his professional, and apparently personal, life as well and come to the conclusion that he needed to devote himself to an activity he deemed worthwhile.  He became a Socratic questioner, went back to school to earn several masters degrees in process, and found himself a wife from among his students.  The chapter in which Phillips describes his quest and finds his wife to be is for me the best in the book.<br />The Socratic dialoges themselves are a mixed bag on subjects that range from trivial to serious with comments that range from insightful to trite.  The dialogues are less than truly Socratic in that Socrates generally coversed with one interlocutor at a time and kept the discussion focused on the matter at hand as an aid to approximate the truth.  The procedure and comments in the book are, alas, to undisciplined to stand with what Socrates had in mind and seem at times to degenerate into bull or rap sessions.<br />No terrible harm in that.  Some people, old and young, appear to be genuinely moved and interested by their first attempt to think clearly about important matters.  If only a few people learn to think and to study deeper than they might otherwise have done,  Phillips's efforts will be amply repaid.<br />There is a too easy criticism of academic philosophy in the book which, however, is understandable given the nature of the author's goals.  There is good discussion of contemporary American thinkers such as Walter Kaufmann and John Randall.  Most importantly, of course there is the discussion of Socrates and his great student Plato, and on the influence they have exerted since their times on anybody who has grappled with their thought and learned to question and love the life of the mind -- which is the life of the heart and the soul when schooled.<br />This book is hardly the last word in philosophical thinking but it does not claim to be.  May it awaken readers to a sense of wonder and reflection and thought.the book which, however, is understandable given the nature of the author's goals.

The book straddles the line drawn by some people between religion (in the sense of devotion to a traditional creed) and spirituality (a personal devotion to the transcendent separate from any church or group.) The predominant form of religion in the book is Judaism, but it is very evolutionist, modernistic, and personal, in many respects, and definitely not tied to the texts and practices of traditional Judaism.<br />The book is modernistic and episodic in tone with three principal voices:  a journalist who seems to be a figure for at least some of the author, a lapsed Episcopalian priest, and a woman rabbi of the Synagogue for Evolutionary Judaism.  The three are drawn together by the theft of a cross from the Church and its mysterious appearance at the Synagogue.  The &quot;mystery&quot; is dropped but it is mostly a vehicle to discuss the relationship between Judaism and Christianity, another theme of this complex book.<br />There are long chillingly written scenes of the Holocaust which forms a backdrop to at least some of the thought and action of the principal characters.  Also, important discussions of the philosopher Wittgenstein, which I found very apropos to the spriritual questing theme of the book, comtemporary physics, the big bang theory, and popular song and film.<br />Doctorow has New York City in his bones and the large secular city is artfulllly drawn.  In fact, one of the main themes of the book is the secular city (to steal a title from Harvey Cox's book of many years ago) and of a secular America with its own Civil Religion.  Contrary to what I remember of Doctorow from earlier books, such as The Book of Daniel, Doctorow appears to me to cherish the city and America in their very variety and secularity for the purposes of spiritual growth and questioning that they afford.  A wonderful development from the America-bashing of the 1960s.<br />The book also shows song and poetry, (in the line of Whitman, Reznikoff, Ginsberg, W.C Williams) as components of a spiritual jounney towards self-understanding.<br />As befitting a book with a title from St. Augustine, the book explores questions of original sin, the nature and possiblity of immortality and religious change.  It shows the continual struggle of people with religious questions and, importantly, suggests an evolving religion, not necessarily bound to the forms of the past.<br />The book does not give answers but provokes questions and is an antidote to all-pervasive smugness or indifference.<br />A valuable book for those who want to think about religion and spiritual issues or to see why people think about them.  Difficult to read, at the outset, but the effort will be rewarded.pment from the America-bashing of the 1960s.<br />The book also shows song and poetry, (in the line of Whitman, Reznikoff, Ginsberg, W.C Williams) as components of a spiritual jounney towards self-understanding.<br />As befitting a book with a title from St. Augustine, the book explores questions of original sin, the nature and possiblity of immortality and religious change.

It is the story of Father Urban, a Catholic Priest in the little know religious order of the Clementines.  It takes place in Chicago, where Father Urban is headquarted as the &quot;star&quot; and best known speaker in the Order.  He is also something of a fund-raiser with a wealthy, arrogant benefactor named Billy.  Father Urban is transferred to a remote town in Minnesota, Duserhaus, shortly after the novel begins as a result of a disagreement with the head of the Order.<br />This novel operates on many levels.  It shows the tenacity of Father Urban in creating a role for himself in the community surrounding Dusterhaus after what was deemed to be his exile there.  It is a funny, tightly-written story and the characterization, of Father Urban's colleagues, of the Catholic hierarchy, and of the townspeople and parishoners is acute.  Most important it is a story of the difficulty of serving both God and Mammon and of the need and nature for compromise in the work of the Catholic Church in a pluralistic, materialistic, and essentially secular America.  There are wonderful descriptions of scenery and people.  I particularly enjoyed the discussions of train travel in the Midwest which recall an America vanished not so very long ago... The book features a thoughtful introduction by Elizabeth Hardwick who describes the book as a &quot;most valuable and lasting American novel.&quot;<br />This book is for you if you are interested in books about the United States, about religious experience in the United States, or in unjustly neglected American classics.	2001-03-27

This may be the least known but best portion of her output.<br />As does My Antonia, The Lost Lady pictures the American frontier in the middle west and its closing due to urbanization, the demise of the pioneer spirit, and commercialization.<br />Together with its picture of the changing of the West, the book is a coming of age novel of a special sort and a portrait of a remarkable, because human and flawed, woman.<br />As with many of Cather's works the story is told by a male narrator, Neil Herbert.  We see him from adolescence as an admirer of, and perhaps infatuated by Marian Forrester, the heroine and the wife of a former railroad magnate now settled on a large farm in South Dakota.  Neil matures and leaves to go to school in the East.  We see his idea of Ms. Forrester change as he learns that there is both more and less to her than the glittering self-assured woman that meets his young eyes.<br />The book is also the story of Marian herself, of her marriage, her self-assuredness, and her vulnerabilty.  She is independent and a survivor and carries on within herself through harsh times and difficult circumstances, including the change in character of her adopted home in the midwest.<br />This is a tightly written, thoughtful American novel.	2001-03-08

This is true of Willa Cather.  Her early books, such as My Antonia and O Pioneers are widely read and widely praised as is, to a lesser extent a work from her final years, Death Comes to the Archbishop.  There is a range of writing from Cather's middle years which may show her at her best, without the sentimintality of the earlier writings.  These middle period books are, alas, not well known.<br />One of these books, My Mortal Enemy, is a short tightly-written tale which can be read in a single sitting or two.  But its short length holds great complexity and pathos.  The book is difficult to approach because it includes a largely unsympathetic heroine, Myra Henshawe.<br />Ms. Henshawe left small-town Illinois behind her as a young woman to marry the man she thought she loved.  In so doing, she turned her back on a large inheritance.  She lives the high life in New York City as the wife of a businessman.  She knows writers, artists, but is incorrigibly jealous and has a sharp tounge and a biting wit.<br />The elderly couple find themselves in hard times and settle in San Francisco.  Myra Henshawe, sharp tounged and critical as in her youth, says harsh, irrevokable things about her life and her marriage and modernistic art and culture.  She returns for value to the ritualistic elements of the Catholicism of her youth, the religion of her uncle who disinherited her when she eloped.<br />The story is told by a third party narrator, as is My Antonia, who functions in varied ways throughout the story.<br />The story is about the well of bitterness, of lost sad lives, the limitations of romantic love and the tarnished heroine's view of religion as a possible source of redemption.	2001-02-12

It ties together two seemingly unrelated stories: the first dealing with the professional and libidinous difficulties of David Lurie, a 52 year old professor of English, the second dealing with the change in South African Society with the end of apartheid.<br /><br />The story of David Lurie involves his liason with a prostitute,  his subsequent seduction of a young student, and his consequent loss of his academic position.<br /><br />The story of South Africa involves Lurie's daughter who is attemption to establish a life for herself in the rural areas of South Africa and who is brutally raped while her father is visiting her.<br /><br />The most remarkable aspect of the book is its ability to present volatile issues and persons with a minimum of moralization and criticism.  We learn to understand something of David Lurie and of South Africa and to control our predisposition to rush to instant, nonmeasured judgment.<br />Society and individuals both change and age for reasons internal to themselves.  Some things must be learned and understood through time.<br /><br />I think this is what the book is about and it is beautifully conveyed.	2001-02-09

At the time of its publication, the book was recognized as a seminal study of America's &quot;peculiar institution&quot;. Time has not changed the value of the book.<br />The book attacks a picture of the Old South that attained wide currency after Reconstruction and was carried through American culture in works such as, for example, Gone With the Wind-- that plantation slavery was a benign institution, part of an agrarian way of life, that was accepted by both slave and master. Professor Stampp shows that slavery had an economic, commercial basis, that it was resisted by slaves overtly and covertly, and that led to squalor, cruelty and suffering by the slaves. The peculiar institution does not merit sentimintality in any form.<br />In reading the book a half-century after its publication, and with some benefit of having read subsequent studies, I was struck with the moderate tone of the book.  Yes, there were humane masters in an inhumane system and yes,there were variants in time and place.  Stampp gives these variants their due, perhaps more than modern students would be inclined to do.<br />I was stuck with the tone of slavery's defenders, pre Civil War and thereafter, describing the institution as &quot;patriarchal&quot;.  Not only is that description in error, as Stampp shows, but for readers in a time beyond the mid 1950s, it is hardly a compliment to call a society &quot;patriarchal&quot;, even if it deserved this characterization.<br />There has been a great deal of writing since the publication of this book on matters such as the nature of the slave trade, the presence, or lack of it, of an indigenous culture among the slaves, and the economic viability of slavery.  These studies add to the picture that Professor Stampp has drawn.<br />This is an essential book for the understanding of our Nation's history.

The title of the book suggests a study of Abraham Lincoln and his impact on American values.  The exploration of this subject alone is a formidable task, but Professor Diggins adds to it with his discussions of the American Revolution, the political philosophy of Locke, the observations on American character of de Tocqueville, the political economic theorizing of Veblen and Weber, the studies of American liberalism by Louis Hartz, and much more.<br />Professor Diggins argues against those scholars who see Lincoln exclusively as a pragmatic policitican and claims that our Sixteenth President sought a foundational, non-relativistic source for our political values in the principle that all men are created equal, and in the right of all to work and to strive to own property and to better themselves. Lincolns' philosophy, Diggins claims, had its roots in the Declaration of Independence and in Lockean ideas.  His reading of Lincoln is supported by discussions of numberous speeches and writings, most of which can be found in the wonderful two-volume Library of America edition of Lincoln's writings.<br />The broad targets of Professor Diggins's book are philosophical relativists.  Much of the book, however, is devoted to a polemic against modern multiculturalism and deconstruction. Lincoln, the philosophy of consensus (one shared broadly by Americans irrespective of their interest group, race, sex, status), and the value of work motivated by material self-interest are defended as an integral part of the American vision, striven for by all and, paradoxically, expanding the scope of our liberties.<br />The book suffers, I think, from being overly ambitious and from its structure.  The arguments are unduly repetitive and this, I think, hinders Professor Diggins from developing them with the depth they deserve.  The book strays too far from Lincoln.  While much of the discussion of other figures in the book is valuable and illuminating, particularly the discussion of Professor Hartz and of the Federalists, it moves too far from Lincoln or, more precisely, it gives the book a loose free-wheeling character with ideas suggested rather than sufficiently developed.  Similarly, Professor Diggins's criticism of multiculturalism, with which I greatly sympathize, is not well integrated with the rest of the book.  It is simply too much to do a political polemic, a study of Lincoln, and a treatment of American intellectual history in a single, relatively short volume.<br />These quibbles to one side, the work is well worth reading.  It explores our American heritage, challenges prevailing orthodoxies and offers much for further study and reflection.

It was subject to an obscenity trial in England although it escaped U.S. censors unscathed. The book was reissued in 1988, coinciding with the release of a movie loosely based upon it. The book's dark vision remains with the passage of time. It is not a book for the squeamish, faint-hearted, or for the conventional.<br /><br />The book consists of a series of loosely related stories of varying length taking place in the tenements of Brooklyn. Many of the incidents center around an odious local bar known as &quot;the Greeks&quot; and its patrons. The longest story, &quot;Strike&quot; is about a long and ugly labor dispute and its effect on Harry, a worker and the strike organizer, on his marriage and on his sense of sexual identity. The story is detailed, sordid, violent, and fascinating. Other stories explore the world of cheap hookers, transvestites, drug users, petty crooks and drunks. The stories are raw told in a crude language of the streets appropriate to their subject matter.<br /><br />The book reminded me of the early work of probably my favorite novelist, the Victorian writer George Gissing, in its concentration of the underlife in our cities. There is little of the express vulgarity and sexual crudity in the Victorian writer, but I think Gissing and Selby would have understood each other nonetheless.<br /><br />This book is a disturbing picture of low life, partly written in the language and mores of its times but transcending that. There is little in the way of hope or love in the book and I think that the author wants to show us the consequences of a lack or hope and love. It is a book that in a materialist age can teach compassion in a language and style that pulls for attention. It is very sad, but the book invites and demands reflection. It shows us what is missing. This is probably a book that will be remembered in the literary history of America.<br /><br />Robin Friedmann Friedman	2001-01-22

Nevertheless, it is a gripping story, well told, and difficult to put down.  There are parallel novels in American literature, but that does not detract from the merits of this book.<br />The story is about an immigrant Iranian family, the Beharanis, searching for success in its adopted land, a lower middle class American woman, Kathy Nicholo, and a policeman, Lester Burdon.  The story is told alternatively in the voices of Colonel Beharani, formerly of the Army of the Shah of Iran, Kathy, and occasionaly in the third person, of Lester.<br />Kathy's home is seized in error by the office of the tax collector and she is evicted.  The house is bought by Beharani at an auction for one third of its market value.  The book is concerned to unravel the tangle.<br />The unravelling does not succeed and tragedy results to all the major protagonists of the novel.  There are elements of Shakespearean tragedy here and of American realism.<br />The story will bear a number of reasons and the author, commendably, is absent in his own voice.  I don't read the book as a social criticism of the United States.  Instead, to me the story operates on a type of religious level.  It shows the wellsprings of human behavior in greed, hostility, and ignorance and in the tendency we all share to be judgmental and overly moralizing when it comes to our fellows.  There is a thin veneeer that separates the lives of most of us from tragedy and violence and in this story, alas, the veneer proves insufficient.<br />The story teaches reflection, dispassion, and forbearance -- lessons valuable in 20th century American, in Iran, and in every other place and time.	2001-01-16

The format of the book, however, is somewhat unusual.  Each of the poets in the book chose a single poem to be included and followed the poem with an essay or &quot;commentary&quot; about it.  The commentarys themselves vary in form from a whimsical four line verse by Charles Bernstein to lengthy essays.<br />The poems vary in styles from very traditional verse to modern free poetry.  As to be expected, the poets bring different convictions and perspectives to their appointed task of illustrating the variety and the purpose underling &quot;Jewish American Poetry.&quot;  As more than one poet and commentator points out, each of these words themselves will bear lengthy exploration:  what is &quot;American&quot;  what is &quot;Jewish&quot;, possibly most importantly &quot;what is poetry and why write it or read it&quot;.  Many of the poems are reflections on Jewish tradition, family, the Holocaust, the pressures and challenges of modern materialistic secular (again, what is that?) culture, and, an apparently never-ending topic of debate, feminism.  Woemen and their varied issues within Judaism and well represented in the choice of poets.  The poets and commentaries vary widely in quality.  My favorites include the poems of Anthony Hecht, Maxine Kumin, C.K. Williams, and Eleanor Winer though each reader will make his or her own choice.<br />In addition to the poems and commentaries, the book includes a good introduction by the editors and several essays.  The essays vary in subject matter and quality. I found very helpful the essays by Steven Rubin and Michael Heller on the history of American poetry in the 20th Century and how the poetry written by American Jews both comments upon and takes issue with the broader trends in American poetry.  Some of the feminist oriented essays were too shrill and tangentially related to the poems in the book for my liking and were also, perhaps, overly technical for people coming to poetry for the first time.  There were essays on the Jewish mystical tradition, particularly the Shekhina or feminine aspect of God, but these essays seemed to have little directly to do with the poetry offered in the book.  The essay on Yiddish poetry and the essays on the perils and virtues of translation were very good.<br />I would have rather seen more than one poem by each of the poets in the collection. As it is, the representation of each poet is too thin to give much an idea of the tenor of their work.  As a related point, there is too much talk in the book and not enough poetry.  The essays are useful to a degree, but I suggest that this book be read in conjunction with Steven Rubin's (the author of a good historical essay in the book) anthology of Jewish American poetry, Telling and Remembering, which includes a much more generous selection of poets and poems and less in the way of gratuitous or questionable essaying.al for people coming to poetry for the first time.

The message today is as timely as it was then -- or, for that matter as it was during Civil War America. Professor Nichols' book is a good overview of Indian policy during the Civil War-- an often overlooked part of the Lincoln story.<br />The book begins with an overview of the system of Indian administration as it had developed by 1860. It was dominated by the political spoils system and by corruption resulting from the power accorded to the Indian agents. As a master of the art of pragmatic politics, Lincoln used the system -- as he needed to do--to hold the Union together-resulting in tragedy for too many of our country's Indian wards.<br /><br />The book discusses the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma (then Indian territory) and their relationship to both the Union and the Confederacy. The story picks up focus, though, in the discussion of the Minnesota Sioux rebellion, the summary trials and capital sentences of over 300 Sioux Indians, and Lincoln's remission of the death sentence in all but 39 cases. Nichols tells this story well, perhaps giving Lincoln's actions less credit and less courage than they may deserve.<br /><br />The book discusses Lincoln's attempts in 1862 to reform Indian policy, which were defeated by War exigencies and by Congressional inaction. Nichols discusses a famous meeting held between Lincoln and the Indian chiefs in 1863 in the White House, again perhaps undervaluing Lincoln's intentions and the difficulties he faced.<br /><br />The book considers the policy resulting from the Sioux war of concentrating the Indians under the control of the military with unsuccessful and inhumane results in Arizona and New Mexico. The book also includes an account of the too little known Sand Hill Massacre in Colorado in 1864.<br /><br />The treatment of the American Indians does not constitute one of our nation's or of President Lincoln's prouder accomplishments. Professor Nichols is correct that this story deserves to be known as part of our history. The book ties Lincoln's treatment of the Indians to prevailing ideologies at the time involving a disrespect of cultural differences, to westward expansion, industrialization, the political patronage system, and, first and foremost, the Civil War. Even Nichols appears to acknowledge that given the War, there was little that might have been done differently at the time in the way of systematic reform.<br /><br />As is unfortunately the case with most histories of Indian affairs, it is easier, as Nichols does, to find a great deal of deserved fault than it is to develop answers, as he does not. This book is worth reading as a good history of Indian affairs during the Civil War era.<br /><br />Robin Friedmannown as part of our history.

In &quot;The Buddha of Infinite Light&quot;  Suzuki explores the &quot;Pure Land&quot; or &quot;Shin&quot; Buddhist tradition.  This is the most widely followed Buddhist tradition in Japan.<br />The book consists of lectures Suzuki gave in 1958 to the American Buddhist Acadamy, New York City.  They were first published in 1970 and were revised and edited by Professor Taitetsu Unno of Smith College in 1997.<br />The book is short but dense.  It is not a mere summary of the Pure Land Tradition, valuable as that is for those coming to it without background, but a development and an interpretation of it.<br />Pure Land differentiates between an other-power, or Oya-sama in the spiritual life, in which we respond to a source outside ourself, and a self-power.  Most Buddhist teachings, particularly the Theravada tradition, rely on self-power.  The practitioner has to work out his own salvation through meditation and right practice and following the eight-fold path.<br />As I understand it, Pure Land is an other directed form of Buddhism which views Amida Buddha as the source of love, compassion, and the source of salvation.  I don't think it quite equates to the Western concept of God, difficult as that concept is to explain.  By reflection on Amida Buddha and the chanting of his name, the Pure Land Buddhist hopes to attain the Pure Land with the ultimate goal of Nirvana.<br />Suzuki writes (page 24)&quot;Pure Land is right here, and those who have eyes can see it around them.  And Amida is not presiding over an ethereal paradise; his pure Land is this defiled earth itself.&quot; Thus, contrary to what may be the usual interpretation of the Pure Land, Suzuki does not equate the Pure Land to an other worldy heaven but places it within us and our lives to be achieved by faith, practice, and sincerity.This interpretation, I think, tends to establish points of similarity between Pure Land (Shin) and Zen.<br />This is a learned book with discussions of Buddhist texts and history.  As with his works on Zen, Suzuki draws illuminating parallels with western religious thinkers, particularly Eckhart.  There is also a chapter I found particularly eloquent on Pure Land Myokinin.  This is a term that applies to devoted followers who have attained spiritual understanding but who are not ordinarily learned in a traditional academic sense.  Pure Land provides a form of salvation open to everybody willing to trust in Amida rather than an exercise that appeals only to the learned.<br />This would probably not be the best introduction to Buddhism for a person approaching it for the first time. The book explains the Pure Land tradition shortly but in depth.  It shows the appeal of the movement.  It thus does not simply present an interpretation of a foreign religious tradition but can help readers of all persuasions understand something of the nature of spiritual life.s is a learned book with discussions of Buddhist texts and history.

US	48185764	RHAPKIAUJ7AO8	0385497687	508232352	The Plato Papers: A Prophecy	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Footnotes to Plato	The philosopher Alfred North Whitehead described the history of Western Philosophy as a series of footnotes to Plato.  This great thinker is both revered and parodied in Ackroyd's short, puzzling novel.<br />This book takes place in London, 3700 AD.  Plato is an orator who lectures and studies the past.  There are quirks, satires, and which in some instances are clever, in others just silly.  There are discussions of Darwin's Origins of the Species( attributed to  C. Dickens) the works of Edgar Allen Poe, and Freud which rescue the book from triviality.  Also discussions between Plato and his soul and between Plato and his colleagues which recreate in part the form of the Ancient Platonic dialogue.<br />Plato discusses the past ages of civilization, which are given ugly and irrelevant sci-fi names, as the ages of love, belief, materialism.  In the climax of the book, Plato descends into his famous cave, as his namesake did in book VII of the Republic to see contemporary London in all its obsession with technology, and sex, but a place worth reflecting on, nonetheless.  Plato reflects on the difficulty of one age knowing another (a point of the Darwin-Dickens mix up and of other similar incidents in the book) and of the need for a spiritual rather than a materialistic means of understanding.<br />The book ends with a trial similar to that of Socrates in the Apology.  Plato is acquitted but leaves London and becomes a wanderer.<br />London in 3700 is a cramped place with little individuality.  Maybe like the Greek Polis?  Our modern world has its attractions for all its flaws in its celebration of individuality.<br />There is a lot of silliness in this book and a lot of value.  In some ways it is like its great namesake, who is truly one of the great people of the west.  The ancients by our lights didn't know much about fact or about technology.  They were remarkably primitive.  In understanding human behavior and spirituality, they, and Plato, remain with much to teach us.  Inexhaustible.  Although cast through the irritating light of science fiction and futurism, the book invites us to try to see our world through Plato's eyes.ch us.  Inexhaustible.

The hotel was cheap and unsanitary.  As long as the guests paid their bills, Madame Rachon allowed them a broad range of freedom in their eccentric lifestyles.  The beat hotel was home to the beats as well as to various artists, models, and other bohemians before it closed in 1963.<br /><br />The book includes wonderful bigraphical pictures of Allen Ginsberg, his lover Peter Orlovsky, Gregory Corso, William S. Burroughs, Brion Gysin (whose name was unfamiliar to me), and others who stayed at the beat hotel.  There is detailed documentation on the activities of each during their stay in the beat hotel with some thought given to why each of these people are important and worth knowing something about.<br /><br />I found the discussion of the day to day life in the hotel the most rewarding part of the book together with a discussion of the relationships of the beats, and other guests, to Olympia Press, which published many of them together with many forgetable works of pornography at that time available only with difficulty in the United States.<br /><br />The book invites reflection on the nature of the beat movement and of the broader movement of bohemianism as it developed in the 19th Century.  What were the beats looking for?  They were full of unconventional, shocking behavior, particularly in the abuse of drugs and sex as these are documented graphically in the book.  They were also serious, had a dedication to literature, a willingness to explore and to come to terms with themselves, a desire for change.  The beats were perhaps the most cohesive literary movement 20th Century America has produced and in some cases produced works of merit.  Miles's discussion of the work and achievement of these writers encourages one to want to know more.<br /><br />Miles ties the beats in to later developments in pop culture in the 1960s: rock and roll, psychedelics, open sexuality.  This to me is claiming too little and too much.  It trivializes this movement, I think, to watch the commercialization that took place during the 1960.  The beats were isolated, troubled, and searching individuals who, in their productive days, neither had nor wanted the glare of the media.  What they did was for themselves and what we make of them is a matter for reflection and not for subsequent 1960s hype.<br /><br />I read Miles biography of Kerouac and was moved by it to read this book.  I wasn't disappointed.  He is a thoughtful writer on a significant American literary movement.of these writers encourages one to want to know more.<br /><br />Miles ties the beats in to later developments in pop culture in the 1960s: rock and roll, psychedelics, open sexuality.

Prior to the War, Whitman had already written most of the poetry that would ultimately establish his reputation as the greatest and most quintisentially American poet. With the publication of his Civil War poems, &quot;Drum -Taps&quot; and works in commemoration of President Lincoln (primarily, &quot;When Lilacs Last in Dooryard Bloomed&quot;, Whitman had a second flowering as a poet.  These works bear eloquent testimony to the trials that the United States had undergone and to Whitman's vision of America.<br />Morris's book begins with Whitman in New York City at the outbreak of the War with the poet living a rootless, somewhat purposeless life focused on the bohemian taverns of New York City.  With the thought that his brother George might be wounded at the battle of Fredricksburg, Whitman visits the site, views the carnage of the War, and returns changed.<br />The book details how Whitman works as a nurse in Washington D.C. visiting and tending the sick and wounded.  There are graphic descriptions of Civil War Era illnesses and wounds and of the relatively primitive state of American medicine for treating the endless ranks of the sick and wounded.<br />Whitman made the rounds of the hospitals, brought cheer and comfort to the sick, wrote letters for them home and made them small gifts of food, tobacco, and necessaries.  He received the gratitude of many a young man and his family.  Morris establishes the distinguished character of Whitman's war service.<br />In some instances, Whitman became emotionally and perhaps homoerotically attached to the young men in his charge.  Morris's descriptions of these relationships are models of restraint and judgment.<br />Throughtout, Morris amplifies his discussion of Whitman's war activities by quotations from his great collection of Civil War poetry, &quot;Drum Taps&quot;.  Little is known about the precise dates of composition of the poems in this collection.  They represent, however, a major literary legacy of the Civil War era.  I turned and reread the poems with renewed understanding after completing Morris's biography.<br />The Civil War was a watershed for the United States both politically and culturally.  Whitman and his contemporary, Herman Melville, were among the few writers whose work encompasses both sides of the Civil War divide.  Both wrote memorable books of poetry about the War.  (Melville's book is titled &quot;Battle-Pieces&quot; and his Civil War biography is also available.)<br />In their poignancy, variety, and sweep, Whitman's poetry can illuminate the meaning of the Civil War and the promise of the United States.

It is set specifically in post World War II Germany and describes well what surely were the feelings of many.  But the sense of loss, alienation, lack of love, religious doubt set forth in the book go much deeper than that.<br />The book is told first person by its hero, a clown, Hans Schneir, who has enjoyed some success but has fallen to the state of pennilessness and drink after abanonment by his love, Marie,  and an injury.  The stuff of which romantic novels are made, but also the stuff of realism and symbolism too.  Hans is from a wealthy but emotionally impoverished family who establishes a romantic liason with Marie, a young promising student who abandons her studies for him.  She in turn ultimately leaves him based in part on her attachment to Catholicism.  Schnier is an unbeliever but a&quot;monogamous&quot; unbeliever and can't adjust himself to the loss of Marie.  He looks to friends, family, and others for comfort but finds none.  Schneir says near the end of the book in an important passage &quot;If our era deserves a name it would have to be called the era of prostitution. People are being accustomed to the vocabulary of whores.&quot;  This theme is pervasive to the book together with hints about a way out.  For example, in the course of a pivotal discussion between Schneir and his father Schneir alludes to and rejects the possibility that he must &quot;lose [his] soul -- be totally empty, then I can afford to have one again.&quot;<br />The book is full of flashbacks from the narrators part interspersed with his reflections on his current actitivies and situation.  His thought center on his own spiritual and emotional poverty, on the loss of Marie, his ambivalence towards religion, and the attempted change among Germans following their defeat.  In some ways, the book and its end remind me of Schubert's great song cycle, Die Winterreise.  The translation seems to me not of the best but it serves to convey the book.

He tries to show that mystical experience is not simply a product of the time, place, and background of the individuals claiming such experience.  Those holding that mystical experiences are the product of such considerations are called &quot;constructivists&quot;.  Their philosophical ancestor, for Professor Forman, is Kant.  In opposition to constructivism, Professor Forman argues that mysticism in its most basic form is a &quot;pure consciousness event&quot; (PCE) -- the mind knowing itself in a nonlinguistic manner involving pure awareness of mind as such.<br />Professor Forman relies in large part on reports of the mystical experience from people far removed from each other in terms of time and culture.  He discusses his own experiences, those of contemporary Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist mystics,and ancient texts by Buddhist and Hindu contemplatives reporting on the mystical experience.  He states that he has been greatly influenced by the transcendental meditation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Ram Dass, and Meister Eckhart; and the first and third of these are discussed in the book.  In addition to Eckhart, Professor Forman's book is also heavily influenced, I find, by William James's &quot;Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; and by Jean Paul Sartre.<br />In addition to discussing and attempting to describe the nature of the mystical experience (no small task in itself), Professor Forman takes issue with philosophers such as Kant, Husserl and a contemporary writer on mysticism, Steven Katz, who see the mystical experience as conditioned by language. (The constructivists are juxtaposed against the &quot;perennialists&quot; who, we learn, have no sensitivity to the nuances of language, time, and place.)<br />The philosophic argument of the book is found in a dense discussion in chapter 4 &quot;Non-Linguistic Mediation&quot; which is a critique of the philosophy of Kant.  Although Professor Forman allows the nonphilosophically inclined to skip this chapter it is pivotal to his philosophical argument.  I was unable, at any rate, to agree with Professor Forman's description of the Kantian philosophy or with its critique.  It turns on an argument that Kant's Transcendental Aesthetic was not intended to apply to mystical experience and that the restrictions it would place on human knowledge do not apply to the mystical experience. Unfortunately, I found that this argument does not meet Kant's argument which was squarely directed against unmediated experience as well as unmediated philosophizing.<br />Professor Forman also is critical of the arguments of Edmund Husserl on the intentional nature of consciousness, finding in Husserl a restatement of the constructivist claim of Kant.  I am not sure if Professor Forman is correct in considering Husserl a constuctivist.  Much of Husserl's phenomenology, which focuses as I understand it on a description of experience (bracketed to avoid causual questions such as those Professor Forman addresses) is useful in an attempt to understand the nature of the mystical experience -- recognized by Professor Forman in a backhanded way, I think.<br />As a philosophical critique, the book is less than successful.  As a description of the mystical experience and as a statement of why such experiences may be valuable and important it does much better.  The subject richly deserves attention, as does the nature of the spiritual life and Professor Forman has much to say.<br />I think the problem at bottom as the mysticism is not by its nature susceptible to philosophical analysis or justification.  As the Buddha for one insisted it is experiential in character and can't be reached by philosophical argument.  Again, Husserl and William James are helpful here.  One must look and see for oneself  If one engages in a contemplative practice and looks and sees, the nature of the path becomes opened by the process and practice.  The issue of &quot;constuctivism&quot; is irrelevant one way or the other to the nature of the experience.  Both the &quot;constructivist&quot; approach and Professor Forman's critique are off the mark in that they both attempt to put in words what is undescribable and experiential.cess and practice.

This volume consists of Melville's first three novels, Typee(1846), Omoo(1847) and Mardi (1849)<br />Melville's novels are based, more or less loosely, on his life at sea.  The first two novels describe voyages to the Marquesas and to Tahiti.  They are filled with lush descriptions of scenery, and tales of adventure.  Of the two, Typee is filled with encounters with cannibals and Polynesian maidens while Omoo presents a wider canvas of characters and scenes.  Both books emphasize the sexual openness and relative simplicity of Polynesian life as compared to life in the United States and both books are critical as well of attempts to Christianize the islanders.  These are not unusual themes today and probably were not as radical in the 1840s as one might suppose.  The stories are well told and the descriptions alluring.  These books made Mellville's reputation as a young writer.<br />Mardi, however, is the gem of this collection.  Its relationship to the earlier novels can be analogized, say, to the relationship between the young Beethoven's first symphony on the one hand and the growth of language and thought in the second and third symphonies on the other hand.  Melville prefaces the book with the note that his first two books were fact-based but were received with &quot;incredulity&quot; while Mardi was pure romance and &quot;might be recieved for a verity.&quot;  (Little likelihood of that)<br />The book as in a baroque, ornate, and bravado style that Melville would bring to completion in Moby Dick.  It is an allegory involving the search for Yillah, a strange, mthical maiden, through the seas of Mardi -- Polynesian for &quot;the world&quot;.  The narrator is accompanied by King Media, by the philosopher Babbalanja, the singer Yoomi, and the historian Mohi.  There are many wonderfully exasperating discussions.  They wander far and wide in search of Yillah and in there wandering we here many religious allegories and many depictions of the Europe and United States of Melville's own time.  There are shadowy maidens, villans, long scenes in the empty wide ocean, and pages of Melvillian thought and bluster.<br />The book is high American romanticism and presents a religious and personal quest by the narrator that resounds of similar quests by many in our own day.  For example, there is a famous unfinished novel of the religious quest called Mount Analogue by a French writer, Duhamel, which fits quite compactly into just a few chapters of Mardi.  Mardi is a long, maddenlingly difficult book but worth the effort.<br />Americans can learn about themselves by learning about their literature and this book is a fitting place to start (or continue).  For those with the patience, it is worth reading these books in order (perhaps with other reading sandwiched in between) to discover the growth of a great and troubled American writer and chronicler of the inward life, as well as of sea journeys.in search of Yillah and in there wandering we here many religious allegories and many depictions of the Europe and United States of Melville's own time.

Towards the end of his book, Professor Lopez discusses Oscar Wilde's paradoxical maxim that &quot;Life imitates Art&quot; and views this as summarizing in a nutshell the West's attitude towards Tibet.  Professor Lopez shows how the West's fascination with Tibet is of long duration and stems from a need to project to this esoteric little-known culture a spiritual search the West, or some people in it, are making for themselves.  Tibet and its Buddhism thus become vehicles for the transmission of ideas that sometimes are only remotely related to this source.<br />Thus, most broadly, in the late 19th century, the Victorians viewed Buddhism as a form of rational religion under which one could live ethically and spiritually without a theology, a frightening God, or revelation. (This remains one of the attractions of Buddhism today for Westerners.) Tibetan Buddhism, with its mantras, its many divinities, its paintings and chants was viewed by many as in derogation of the teachings of &quot;original Buddhism.&quot;<br />Later writers, influenced by Theosophy, the occult, the drug culture, or New Age, found in Tibet materials to support their predelictions, sometimes on the most questionable bases.  What was missing in all of this, according to Professor Lopez, was an attention to Tibetans themselves and to Tibetan sources.<br />Thus we learn about the Tibetan &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;, the Tibetan mantra &quot;Om Padhe... Hum&quot;, its art, as reflected through different Western eyes.  We learn about the Tibetans in exile and about the Dali Lama's attempts to hold his people together while creating a world-wide basis of support.  I was particularly interested in Professor Lopez's discussion of the growth of Tibetan Buddhist studies in the Universities and of his discussion of the sometimes uneasy alliance between the worlds of scholarship and reflection on one hand and popular culture on the other hand.<br />This book is valuable for what it shows about distortions of Tibet and of how we mold reality to suit our needs.  There is some spritual quest, though, or need that underlies the interests that many bring to Tibetan Buddhism and to Buddhism in general. That seeking, and the message that one may find in Buddhism of an analysis of the human condition that is separate from particularities of time and culture, is what is of value, I think, in the revival of interest in Buddhism.

It is an inspiring phrase and an apt title for a Lincoln biography.  Professor Neely's biography is good and solid in its analysis of Lincoln's life.  It lacks, however, something of the eloquence and vision of the title and of Lincoln's words.  We never learn why Lincoln considered the United States &quot;the Last Best Hope of Earth&quot; or what that can mean for our country today.<br />That said, this book is a good introduction to Lincoln and his Presidency.  The book skims briefly over Lincoln's life before he became the 16th President.  There are advantages to this, but the treatment of the Lincoln-Douglas debates and of the Kansas-Nebraska Act which led to them is too brief to help understand sucession and the Civil War which followed.<br />The book's treatment of Lincoln's relationship with his Generals and of the strategy of the War is probably the best single chapter.  It has something to teach even those who are familiar with the military history of the war.  The chapter on Lincoln as a pragmatic politician and on the 1864 campaign is also well done. The book treats the Emancipation Proclamation at length but to me anyway left something to be desired. (The text and some explicit treatment of it would help) and discusses the fate of Civil Liberties during the War and domestic development during the war in good but not dispositive detail.<br />If you are looking for an understanding of Lincoln and of the Civil War this is a good place to start but not to end.  I suggest reading the book together with the complilation of Lincoln's own speeches and writings in the Library of America series.	2000-10-16
US	48185764	R2QXEWXEL77VRC	0140165215	472314295	Paradise News	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A thoughtful comedian	This is a deceptively simple book to read with many important themes.  It is the tale of people from England who travel to Hawaii on a charter package for holiday.  The main characters are a lapsed Irish priest,(Bernard) who teaches theology, and his crusty aged father who are summoned to Hawaii to visit a long lost sister of the father who is on her deathbed.<br />The story is a brisk, breezy satire on Hawaii tourism.  With the exception of the main theme and characters, much of the story is not well developed.  The main theme, as it involves Bernard stresses growth and change after a lapse of belief in religious dogma.  It explores the growth of human love and sexuality as Bernard is able to consummate his relationship with a separated woman he meets in Hawaii, comes to terms with his vocation as a theologian and learns the virtues of love, patience and forgiveness.  He comes to appreciate the nature of religious doubt and the attendant spiritual search through human love and through reflections on the human condition as reflected in the works of William Butler Yeats, the Victorian poets, the Spanish philosopher Unamuno, and the Gospel of Matthew, among other sources.<br />There is a book by John Updike called &quot;In the Beauty of the Lillies&quot; which deals with the lapse of faith by an American Protestant Clergyman.  In Updike's book, when faith is lost, all is downhill for the protagonist and his family.  I think Lodge's book can be instructively compared with Updike insofar as it raises questions of religion, secularism and sexuality.  There is more hope in Lodge's book than I find in Updike's for meaningful human life outside the reach of the creeds.	2000-10-12

Miles's book is valuable because it explains why people continue to read Kerouac and the beats and also focuses on the limitations of the movement, I think, through discussion of Kerouac as a person.<br />Kerouac was first and foremost a writer.  Miles' book emphasizes this.  It discusses virtually each of Kerouac's major works, and minor works as well, in the context of his life -- when, precisely, they were written, what they are about, and where each book fits, in Miles's usually well-considered opinion, in Kedrouac's work as a whole.  Such writing is more the purview of literary criticism than biography but Miles does it well and it is needed in a consideration of Kerouac's life and work. He focuses on the spritual side of the beats, their quarrel with conformity, materialism, and repressed sexuality, and their emphasis on feeling and the expression of feeling.  Miles properly places Kerouac in the romantic tradition of literature and within American Romanticism in particular as a follower, most immediately, of Thomas Wolfe.<br />Miles does not spare Kerouac the man, in a discussion that should discourage any tendendy to hero-worship or mystification.  Kerouac was selfish and inconsiderate of others, adolescent at the core, unduly attached to his mother, on the far fringes of the American right (although he probably deserves to be praised for not adopting the hippie, ultra-left, anti United States attitude of his followers and colleagues), and lead a destructive life, to his own talents and to the lives of people who loved him and had a right to depend upon him, such as his daughter.<br />As a writer, Kerouac emerges in the book as a person of talent with a vision of American life that is valuable (though hardly unique, I think).  He wrote well but too much and too carelessly and too much under the influence of drugs.  He also, as Miles suggests was overly dogmatic and rigid in his use of spontaneous prose.<br />The beats were a unique literary movement and Kerouac was an integral part of it.  His books, I think will continue to be read and valued not for the most part as literary masterpieces, but as expressing the mood of a generation.  There is much in them that is worthwhile.  Miles' portrait of Kerouac and his work is judicious.  It also encourages the reader to explore Kerouac's writings for his or herself, which is the goal of any good biography or a writer.uggests was overly dogmatic and rigid in his use of spontaneous prose.<br />The beats were a unique literary movement and Kerouac was an integral part of it.

US	48185764	R10LA5PINVEPYL	0940450631	870803892	Lincoln : Speeches and Writings : 1859-1865 (Library of America)	Books	5	50	52	N	N	Leadership and Eloquence	This is the second volume of the Library of America Project devoted to the  works of Abraham Lincoln.  It covers the period after the Lincoln-Douglas  Debates and includes many of the records of the Lincoln Presidency and the  Civil War.  The standard Lincoln materials are included, of course, such as  the Gettysburg Address, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the Inauguaral  Addresses.  But there is immeasurably more.  We see Lincoln writing to his  Generals, Cabinet members, and other national leaders in his attempt to  hold the Union together.  We see a lincolns agonizing over military  discipline and frequently pardoning deserting soldiers.  We see Lincoln  dealing with Indian issues in his day; and we see him supporting the use of  black troops in the War effort.  This volume is highly useful in  uderstanding the Civil War.  Equally important it teaches the nature of  leadership and fortitude.  Finally, Lincoln is one of our Nation's great  prose writers and the book deserves reading for that reason alone.  The  Library of America is to be commended for this volume and for its ongoing  series.	2000-09-14

However, the rudiments of Mr. Solomon's analysis, in terms of  tracing Beethoven's life problems, his difficulties with women, with peers,  and with himself to his childhood experiences probably transcends any  specific psychological dogma and is insightful.<br />The book is a biography  rather than an attempt at technical musical analysis.  Even so, it  elucidates the music well and with an obvious love for it.  I found the  discussion of Beethoven's final period works, and of his sometimes  neglected vocal writings, particularly good.<br />The sections on Beethoven's  relationship with Haydn, on his testament written upon the discovery of his  impending deafness  on the immortal beloved, and on his relationship with  his nephew are all thoughtful and helped me better understand  Beethoven.<br />A wonderful book for anybody who loves this composer or wants  to learn more about why other people love him.	2000-09-11
