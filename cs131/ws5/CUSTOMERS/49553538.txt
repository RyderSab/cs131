Here, for the 40th anniversary is this decades version.  Not much new, more than 50% of the book is given to the less than 25% of the band's history-the Brian Jones period.  Only 50 pages (about 10% of the book) are devoted to the period from Steel Wheels on.  We're given a lot of drug detail and told which Stone didn't make which session because he was drunk, stoned or otherwise engaged.  There's a lot of passing out during concerts and the like. There are moments of unintentional humor like Davis considering Keith to be &quot;clean&quot; when he finally kicks heroin for love of Patti Hanson.  Off heroin, yes, but still popping pills, snorting coke, and drinking himself into an alcoholic stupor-what a guy! Or the various chance meetings with Chuck Berry-he liked them, he didn't, he remembered them, he didn't, he punched Keith out, then ran into Ron Wood and apologized thinking it was Keith.  If you're a Stones fan, you've read all this before.  If not, why bother?	2002-01-02

It has greater depth than the &quot;Dummies&quot; book, covering such history  as the slave trade and American Abolition movement to a greater extent than found in a casual survey.   Wyman &amp; Havers also provide a decent intro for ragtime, spirituals and jazz before they get into the meat of the subject.  The book covers the usual subject matter with a little greater depth than usual.  Excellent features include profiles of essential artists (including suggestions on what to purchase for great listening), recording histories of the great songs (Stack O'Lee, Rollin' and Tumblin', etc.) and a recurring map featuring blues highlights. As a blues fan and collector, I found it fascinating reading which I plan to pass on to other fans and nonfans alike.	2001-12-30

My  local library maintains  a &quot;recently deceased authors&quot; display and when I was reading the obit on Robert Ludlum, I glanced over and saw the Hugh Holton display.  Chicago police procedural-looked decent- picked up Windy City.  Wow! what a rush!  A procedural with &quot;serial killer novel&quot; moments of genuine horror and a golden age detective murder scheme.  The murders are done in the style of various  mysteries by some of the novel's characters.  Sounds like a plotline from a Christie/Queen/Carr style  puzzle book of the 30s but I don't recall them ever using it.  Cole and his detectives are believable well developed characters.  The villains are a truly evil couple who could hold their one against a certain cannibal named Hannibal in the creepy category.   An excellent page-turner which has led me to Holton's other books.	2001-12-28

I have not seen every episode of all the various series.   That said I have enjoyed  some of the books written about the Star Trek Universe. The trouble with a multi-authored series though is the uneveness one finds in the mix.   From what I remember of the original series, (and Next Generation and the new series) is the sense of wonder, a feeling of joy and camaraderie between the main characters.  The authors of this book suck that joy and wonder out of everything and write a soulless gloomy novel that bears no resemblance to the Star Trek phenomenon.  It is a novel of despair with not one refreshing moment.  To me, the novels should  reflect the spirit of the series or it's just a bad science fiction novel with characters named after the members of the Trek universe.	2001-11-19

I know I'm reading the books out of order, but just in grabbing them off the shelves randomly-Ceremony, Mortal Stakes, Thin Air, Taming a Seahorse  all feature Spenser riding to the rescue of once or current hookers.   Oh well, in this one April Kyle, the teenage girl that Spenser and Susan thought would have a nice life as a prostitute disappears from the fancy upscale house they put her in and is doomed to work the streets.  While searching for her, Spenser meets ***gasp in amazement*** another young hooker. Naturally she's not a coked-up, used up street walker, she's another in Spenser's long line of beautiful street corner girls.  The girl ends up dead which leads to Spenser beating up her father, tracking her to a Hefner/Flynt clone whose men's clubs are actually highclass whorehouses, and to the club's Caribbean resort which leads to another gorgeous hooker and so on.  Who killed the hooker and her pimp?  Don't know, April, I assume,  will go back to hooking in a manner Spenser prefers.  I found the ending very puzzling-almost like Parker had to maintain a page count and he had to finish it up with no time for tying things up.  There  were about 20 more pages of story could have been wrung out of this one.	2001-10-25

It is far and away the best experience I've had seeing the battlefield.  It follows the battle chronologically and offers several sites and insights not offered on the audio tours available at the local shops.  Many of the stops are multifaceted.  At several points the stops feature 7 to 10 asides which often involve only a minor shift in position to point out various phases of the battle.  It includes a side trip to the cavalry field which I've never run into on the audio tours.  The  driving directions are easy to follow but do veer from the order of the Military Park brochure and the audio tours to give greater detail to the battle.  The book says to allow for 6 hours-it's more like 10 hours to give time for exploring beyond  some of the &quot;stand here and turn left&quot; instructions.  11 hours total if you include a break for lunch.   We started at nine on one morning, toured until about 4 with a break for lunch and finished the following day.  Sites included on the audio and Park tours tend to start getting crowded from 11 to 3, so this will add to the tour time depending on time of year and crowd.  To sum it all up and paraphrase a popular commercial-when going on a tour of Gettysburg-&quot;Don't leave home without it!&quot;	2001-10-22

Put it right up there with your favorite  Hammett, Chandler or MacDonald (Ross or John D).  So good that halfway through listening to the audiotape , I went out an bought the book so I could savor the language and story.  This story reels through your mind like a whirlwind.  Point of view changes keep you constantly up to date with the killer, with PI Elvis Cole and bring you up to speed with a journey into the past of mystery man Joe Pike.Shock follows upon shock as all of the series main characters go through severe life changes in the aftermath of the initial murder.  Crais shakes up the genre and throws monkey wrenches into the works left and right.   Both Crais and fellow PI writer Dennis Lehaye are poised to become the &quot;Next Big Thing&quot;  in the mystery genre.

Matter of fact I hadn't read his last 4 or 5 at all.  But I'm a sucker for the old &quot;town terrorized by corrupt forces&quot; trick-Red Harvest, Seven Samurai, Magnificent Seven-love em all.  So I had to grab the new Spenser and I was not disappointed.  Granted I didn't know some of Spenser's sidekicks having skipped a few, but I was quickly brought up to speed.   This is an excellent example of the genre and deserves a place among the classics of its kind.  You quickly realize this book is a tribute to, rather than a copy of the above classics.   And danged if Spenser doesn't run into an actual mystery for a change.   I guess I have to catch up now.  Welcome back to my shelf, Mr Parker.	2001-08-15

Robert Crais breathes new life into the wisecracking PI genre with his Elvis Cole series.  What at first looks like a Spenser clone, becomes fresh and satisfying with Crais' guidance.   Cole and his partner Joe Pike find themselves as nursemaids to 3 kids whose father has flown from the care of the witness protection program.   What looks to be a case of finding a deadbeat drugged out lowlife takes a turn when the father turns out to be a bit different than Cole's image of him.   The fight to save the family brings Cole into conflict with Vietmnamese expatriates, the Russian mob, the Witness Protection Program and the US Treasury.  It leads to an exciting chase at Disneyland which guarantees that this book will never be made into a Disney film and a stunning conclusion which puts the family in extreme jeopardy.  Write on, Mr Crais, write on.	2001-08-14

The missing person is found before the book is half over.  What gives the book it's central focus is Spenser's moral problem-what do you do with a teenage hooker who doesn't want to leave her current 'job'?  He passes up the chance to bust a big-time pimp preferring to concentrate on a prostitution ring with its roots in the Boston school system.  He rescues the girl from a kinky brothel where insubordinate hookers are sent as punishment only to have her break away and rejoin the the man who recruited her.   Along with Hawk, Spenser engages in one of the most astounding fistfights of his career at the headquarters of the ring and manages to rescue the girl again.   At the end, Spenser and Susan are forced to face the problem of what to do with the girl.  Their options shake Susan to her core and make for an interesting argument on what is good for the girl vs what is legal.   This stands head and shoulders above the usual Spenser parade of wisecracks.  Along with &quot;Mortal Stakes&quot;, this is one of Parker's best.	2001-08-14

I was appalled at his portrait of Muhammed  and the early history of Islam.  Imagine if a writer explained Christianity by decribing Jesus as a bastard child of Mary who described himself as the Son of God to cover his embarassment. (By the way, Muslims accept the holiness of Jesus, if not his divinity and would not treat Him as Muhammed is treated in this book) Fregosi is always looking into the seamier tales of Muhammed like a tabloid gossip reporter.   One of his oft repeated ploys is to write &quot;This book is not the place to cover-&quot; some foible of Muhammed or of Islam in general and then launch into a lengthy discussion of it anyway.   This is not so much history as Mr Fregosi's tirade against the followers of Islam.   As such, it reveals the author's foibles too. Deserves 0 stars.	2001-07-26

And if you haven't read any of Crais' Elvis Cole novels, you'll also realize before too long that Elvis and his partner Joe Pike are similar in tone to Robert Parker's Spenser and Hawk.   But Robert Crais has the ability to take these similarities and craft them into a series and a detective novel with it's very own flavor.  Cole is hired to check out a detective who may have planted evidence.  His findings aren't consistent with what the defense team wants and Elvis is forced to switch teams and work with Joe Pike to clear up a mess he helped create.   Elvis' romantic tangle with a lawyer from Louisiana is brought into play and takes up a little too much page time, but the the climatic 3rd of the book is as satisfying a set of confrontations as anyything in the Spenser series.  Not all of the bad guys get their just desserts and Elvis vows at the end to hound those who get away, which would make a nice story for a future case.   A great PI novel especially for those who distrust lawyers and the media, which is just about everybody but lawyers and members of the media.	2001-07-19

It's just that I find his stories about actor/thief Alan Grofield to be lesser efforts-although still better than 99% of anybody else's suspense output.   And this &quot;Parker&quot; novel seems to concentrate as much, if not more, on Grofield's adventures.  Parker is hired by the Outfit to bust up an independent island casino.  He's approached by federal agents who want the casino's owner brought in for arrest.  All of which makes for a dynamite Parker novel with a little too much Grofield.	2001-06-27

His series (Survivalist, Defender, Track, etc.) depict the lone hero take on incredible odds.  In this, book 1 of his Defender series, the hero Prof. David Holden, spends most of the battle on the sidelines.  During the 1st half of the book, Holden is training his family to defend itself from rampaging gangs of &quot;revolutionaries&quot;.  In the 2nd half, when the training backfires, Holden goes into mourning and depression while his friends secretly begin to fight back against the terrorists. Holden is picked up by the police, suspected of knowing about his friends and their plans.  This is definitely not the usual rampaging avenger fare. The situation is also different from most of the &quot;survivalist&quot; series because, at least in this episode, there is no nuclear holocaust or impending nuclear attack.  The takeover of the US is slow and insidious.  Interesting twist from a recognized master of the genre.	2001-06-19

It treats the material as a campaign rather than a series of seperate battles, so that Little Big Horn is treated as part of a whole.  The author also describes the personalities and deeds of several Indian characters, not just Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse.

Here we have the cream of the Marvel heroes gathered together to fight some awesome menaces.  Several heroes are added to the group and it is arguably one of it's most diverse incarnations.  Black Panther, the greatest of the black superheroes, joins early on in this collection.  The Vison, the lonely android, is given an original and membership. hawkeye becomes Goliath replacing Giant Man/Ant Man who becomes Yellow Jacket.  Henry Pym's problems are the cause of several plot twists in these stories, from his multiple identities to his creation the Ultron line of robotic menaces.  besides the evil robot, we're given excellent villains to battle the Avengers-Magneto, Grim Reaper (1st appearance), The Scarlet Centurion (another persona for the time traveling Kang/Rama Tut/Dr. Doom) and Zemo. Time travel figures in the Zemo story and the Scarlet Centurion epic (a 44 page slug fest beteween different versions of the Avengers).  All in all an excellent collection.  Roy Thomas is always at his best with superhero groups and this is where he honed his craft.  John Buscema's art is  excellent making group battle scenes flow without seeming overcrowded.  The reproduction varies from stark black and white reprints to what appears to be muddy xeroxes of the stories, sometimes within the same story. Except for those few bits of murky copies, Marvel again shows why it dominated the field in the 60s.  Listen up, true believers, Make Mine Marvel Essentials!	2001-04-18

Was an annotated version necessary?  Many of the notes do 1 of 2 things that I find make them totally unnecessary. First, many of them give away plot points long before they actually show up in the story.  So if you haven't already read the trilogy, you're better off just reading the original paperbacks without notes.  Second, they're used to hawk other lesser, often hackwork, spinoff novels from the publishers.  &quot;To see why kenders hate mincemeat pie, see the novel 'Why Kenders Hate Mincemeat Pie' by O. G. Wottasnozzle&quot;.  In an annotated version, I want explanatory notes, not self-serving ads. The spate of lesser novels has severely limited the impact of this trilogy.   So I give this  5 stars for finally publishing a beautiful hardbound copy of the trilogy and 1 star for the ad content-average 3 stars.	2001-03-20

Good fantasy epics are hard to come by.   This one is a promising start to a new one for me.  I won't rehash the plot.  Since there are so many of these epics out there, they all kind of share 3 or 4 plots.  What sets this book apart isn't the plot, it's the little moments in the plot that make it stand out. Some examples-Jack, the baker's boy is moonlighting as a scribe even though he can't read or write.  In his first effort to copy part of a manuscript, he pours ink on a blank page and tries to write into the ink.   On his odyssey through the towns and forests of the Four Kingdoms, he offers to bake bread for those who help him since that is the only means of repayment he knows.   There is the ongoing feud between the evil chancellor Baralis and the conniving Lord Maybor.  Each sets traps and snares for the other only to be foiled--like an endless duel of 2 Wile E. Coyotes.  Baralis drives an innocent dove to starvation by using it as a magical seeing eye.  The Seers of Larn are an awesome creation who I would like to see in the further episodes.   All in all,  this is a fine 1st offering in this trilogy.	2001-03-19

You know the formula, group of questers from multiple races, a child or small creature who will show great power, immense unstoppable evil.   The villain of the piece reminded me of some Ian Fleming Villain with a bent for magic.   There's no innocent waif bonding with a magical creature as depicted in Norton or McCaffrey (with style) or Lackey (with none).   I just found it to be an exciting fantasy with original touches.  Yes, as pointed out, there is some sex but given the total lack of it in fantasies until now, it was bound to happen.  Give it a try.	2001-03-07

I'm enjoying The Great War tetrology much more because the &quot;alteration&quot; is a natural re-writing of a historical event.  So I didn't have high hopes when I saw WWII was to be altered by an alien invasion.   BUT THIS BOOK IS GREAT! Turtledove takes the oldest cliche in pulp sf-the invading lizard race- gives it twists and turns and drops it into WWII.   My sense of wonder was 1st  stirred when it was revealed in the prologue that the lizards , although more highly advanced than humans, progressed at a much slower rate.  The aliens , who think they are invading a nomadic bow and arrow culture, find us with radio, flight , and explosives.   Now they realize they have to kick tail fast or the earth will be counterattacking their home world much sooner than they can devise appropriate defenses.   There are the requisite reality figures-mostly world leaders and a slew of characters so large there is a dramatis personae given. The action hops from China to the US to Poland to space as we catch every facet of the struggle from different viewpoints.  Every character has a unique insight into the War,  Mr. Turtledove has provided an excellent way to escape from the real world for a day or 2.   Now, excuse me, I have to sign off and begin part 2, Worldwar:Tilting the Balance.	2001-02-26

If it starts bad, I can hope for a smashing ending or a pickup in the story about the middle of the book.  Unfortunately, I saw no reason to continue this book past page 100, a rare occurence for me.  Don't get me wrong, Ive read Anderson for years.  Brain Wave, Tau Zero, the Flandry saga are all classics.  His award-winning short stories are examples of what a good sf short should be.  Here he lost me.  The immortal race hidden among us humans has been a staple of legend for centuries.  More recently it was popularized by The Eternal Mercenary series and the Highlander.  Here he adds nothing new and it just a long journey through history.  I notice that star travel is supposed to come into play near the end, but I can't make it.   I apologize, Mr. Anderson, for giving up on this one, but I couldn't see any reason to go on.	2001-02-19

Here Spinrad writes of a future threatened by a sexually transmitted disease that started in Africa worked its way through the gay and drug communities and now is at large in the general population.  The term &quot;AIDs&quot; is not used at all in the story, only mentioned in the author's afterword.  The disease is particularly deadly because as each successful vaccine is found, the virus mutates to a resistant strain almost immediately.    Spinrad's story follows 4 characters: A soldier in a military division of  the infected (nicknamed The Army of the Living Dead), a fundamentalist Christian politician who heads a new Quarantine Bureau of the government, an infected young girl who tries to bring sexual solace to as many of the infected as she can, and a research scientist looking for the ultimate vaccine.  Because the disease requires repeated vaccines to counteract the many mutations, the drug companies don't want this &quot;SuperVaccine&quot; found. Starting with these vastly different characters, Spinrad spins a web of intrigue until the story culminates in the quarantined San Francisco.  The story is tense and exciting.  All the characters grow, for example, the girl becomes almost a religious icon to the infected.   All of this is set in a world where sex is done through machines and various interfaces to protect the quickly diminishing ranks of the uninfected. This is an excellent SF tale  with an adult theme and frightening settings.	2001-02-14

When Parker hears of a plan to rob an entire town, he's leery of the inside man and the number of thieves needed to pull off the caper.  Nevertheless he is brought into the scheme and together with 11 other fellow thieves, they pull off the dream caper until the double cross inevitable in a Parker novel.  In the meantime, the inside man acts on the plan that he formed for vengeance. Grofield (Stark's actor/thief) falls for a hostage and a teen leaving a night of passion at his girlfriend's after curfew also throw monkey wrenches into the story.  When the team makes it to their hideout after several deaths and an inferno, it further unravels as the group waits out the police search.  This is Stark at his finest.  Granted it's a little dated and the plan wouldn't work today. The townfolk have to place out-of-town calls through operators at a central switchboard and the switchboard operators are covered by the team.  Imagine the problems in today's cellular world.  Nevertheless, this pulls together several of Parker's cronies from previous capers and introduces new ones.  We get the usual scenes of plan, payoff,doublecross and Parker's efforts to escape the consequences of the doublecross.  These are set pieces in any Parker novel and Stark works them like a pro.  If you're just discovering Parker through his new capers, this is a must have from the original series.	2001-02-10

When it is presented to the Turkish people by the people of the US, it is immediately stolen by the Greeks and placed in a safe.  Unfortunately, hiding behind a counter near the safe is the irrepressible Dortmunder, out for a night on the job.  His job-burglary.   The ring is so valuable that the FBI joins the NYPD and the various political groups in the hunt for the ring.  The resulting heat on the criminal community becomes so intense that the criminals decide to hunt for the thief themselves.   Figuring  prominently in this hunt is the menacing giant Tiny Bulcher, who looks to commit bodily mayhem on  several persons in his hunt for the thief.   This book is a masterpiece of comedic writing and timing.  As always, Westlake's chapters are brief and to the point with more laughs packed in one 3 page chapter than an entire Saturday Night Live season.  The action skips from group to group as the hunt begins.  Also as always, we have the usual Westlake set pieces-Andy Kelp's latest scheme,  the backroom of OJ's, and Dortmunder's frustration with Kelp.  In one scene, we are treated to Dortmunder sitting in the police station with the ring stuck on his finger, trying to keep it hidden from his interrogaters.      All in all this is another tour de force from Westlake.  Have the French critics discovered him yet?	2001-02-05

Roy was a master at pulling in loose ends from the past and making a story out of them.  In this, he goes back to Fantastic Four #2 which introduced the Skrulls, a shapeshifter race.  At the end of that story, the Skrulls are hypnotized into changing into and spending life as cows.  Roy notices that although there were four skrulls, the final panel only showed 3 cows.  From a small mistake, Thomas crafted an epic.   The Avengers are drawn into a war between the Kree and the Skrull in which the missing 4th Skrull plays a major part.  Along the way, there are battles with all manner of alien villains, another &quot;breakup&quot; of the Avengers, a hero vs hero battle against the FF, and the search for BlackBolt, king of the Inhumans.  The climax is perennial superhero sidekick Rick Jones serving as a conduit for a group of Marvel's original WWII heroes.   With art by John Buscema and Neil Adams, this epic is a can't miss for vintage marvel fans.	2001-01-29

Starting with a very weak team, the Avengers are joined by Giant Man and the Wasp-the also-rans of the original team.   The duo adds nothing but more angst to an already dysfunctional team.   The villains are lame-we get the old missing scientist captured by aliens, the Living Laser, the Ultroids and the Keeper of the Flame.  The only really good story from the period is the Sons of the Serpent story- a decent battle with white supremacists.  Once Hercules comes on board after the obligatory hero vs hero battle ( Herc is brainwashed by the Enchantress) things pick up a little, but at this point GiantMan/ Goliath becomes redundant.   In the tradition of early Marvel Annuals, we get the king-size special featuring the Mandarin commanding a host of villains which necessitates calling in Iron Man and Thor since the team can't seem to handle the &quot;Big Jobs&quot; with the then current roster.   THe best stories of the bunch are the Red Guardian stories, wherein the Russians commission a Communist version of Cap.   As a whole, the book is filler before the Avengers hit another highpoint with what should be in vol. 3. -the arrival of the Vision, Ultron, the Grim Reaper and several other touchstone stories.  This volume, though, lacks the early Marvel pizzazz.	2001-01-22

The earliest stories feature powerhouses Thor, Iron Man and Hulk, along with Giant/ant Man and the Wasp.  After a few issues the Hulk left and was replaced by Captain America in a classic must read story.  The early team fought time spanning menaces like Kang and Immortus, villainous conglomerates like the Masters of Evil, and Wonder Man.  (Although Zemo never seemed very menacing, an ex-Nazi with a hood permanently glued to his head by accident?)  After a dozen or so issues, this team was replaced by Cap, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Hawkeye.  Can you say &quot;power shortage&quot;?  And we're treated to a team that had a hard time defeating a fat robot and the Swordsman.  SO they find themselves thoroughly outmatched when they meet Kang in the last 2 stories in this collection.    But that was the charm of the Avengers.  Their roster changed every dozen or so issues.   While the  Justice League would add a member here and there, you never saw anybody leave the roster. Imagine a JLA where Superman or Batman decided to call it quits for a few years.  This is where we see the genius of Stan Lee.  After forming a superteam of awesome strength, he allowed a change to bring in a team of also rans.  Watch as Cap molds his group into a team that has to use wits instead of brute strength to stop their foes.  At the time, it was a major change in team books.   And as always, watch for the dated female characterizations, especially of the Wasp, who spends most of her time mooning over Thor and fantasizing what Iron Man looks like under the armor.	2001-01-19

THis is the followup novel to The Hunter (AKA Point Blank, AKA Payback).  After his run-in with the Outfit, Parker undergoes plastic surgery in order to avoid further complications.   Parker's next job is an armored car heist.  The entire operation is covered in detail from beginning to end.   While planning the job, Parker is tracked by an employee of the doctor who reveals the doctor has been killed.  Unless the chauffeur can find the killer, the new faces of his recent customers will be revealed to the Outfit.  Parker finds himself in a vise as he goes on with the heist and then has to track the chauffeur in an effort to keep him alive while also uncovering the doctor's killer.  AS always for Parker, nothing goes as easily as planned, there is a double cross on the armored car job and the chauffeur gets away from him. This book is a must for those just discovering Parker through the new novels and Mel Gibson's movie.  Part 3, featuring the mental meanderings of the punch drunk chauffeur,  reveals the slow methodical thought processes while still carrying the story along. The plodding lackey becomes a sympathetic character, maybe the only one in the book, as we follow him on his quest for justice.   This book is quite simply a classic of the genre-but then again, aren't all of Stark's novels classics?	2001-01-17

For the most part, Cap is shown battling sinister organizations and remnants of the Nazis. And Battle he does, Kirby shows more kinetic energy in these stories than any of the other series he worked on.  Perhaps it was the fact that his connection with Cap goes back to the 40s. Every story shines with drawings of Captain America flipping, jumping and slamming his way through battle after battle.   And we get classic stories from the 60s-the Sleepers, Nazi superweapons programmed to arise in the 60s, The Cosmic Cube, the most powerful device in the universe.  Add to this great villains like the Red Skull, Zemo, the Adaptoid and Modok.  I only have one quibble with the book, the starkness of the black and white art does not allow us to see Cap is risking his neck to rescue a black Air Force pilot from Vietnam-the pilot is white here.   In many pages, the Black Panther when out of costume is white.  The only inkling we get that the greatest of the black superheroes is actually black comes because some of the pages had to be photocopied from actual comics.   The Panther was a groundbreaking character in comics but his relevance is almost lost in this anthology.	2001-01-12

However, the idea of the group fighting/breaking up recurs too many times as a plotline.  Other than that, we get several excellent Dr. Doom stories-his origin and the &quot;Battle of the Baxter Building&quot; are classics.  The Baxter Building story has a poignant moment when Reed Richards must decide whether to turn Ben Grimm back into the Thing (possibly forever).  The Hate Monger, in his 1st appearance is a very provacative character for the era.   The stories featuring Dr Storm and Gideon are pure melodrama best read only by completists.  Plus we get 5 crossovers with other characters (4 in a row at one point)-Most of them carried by the misunderstanding that leads the FF to battle other heroes.   However the Daredevil crossover is a classic.   These stories function as filler before the next volume which should feature the premiere appearances of Galactus, Silver Surfer, the Black Panther and the Inhumans.	2001-01-08

Only slightly less of a flag waver than Captain America, the alter ego of millionaire weapons maker Tony Stark, you know whose side he took in the battle between capitalism and communism.  He is the frequent target of Communist villains and often finds himself in Russia and China (one adventure finds him in Cuba) battling the champions of communism.   And it's all in good fun.  Since a Marvel hero had to have a weakness, Tony Stark is always one electric socket away from death since he was hit by shrapnel in Vietnam.  The original Iron Man suit was built, in part, to keep the shrapnel from reaching his heart.  We meet master villains the Crimson Dynamo and the vastly un-PC Mandarin(possibly one of the last of the 'Yellow Peril&quot; villains), along with villains who turned hero (Hawkeye and Black Widow) and some of Marvel's really pitiful villainous creations-Mister Doll, the Phantom, &amp; Gargantus, among others. These lesser villains ( and 2 hero vs hero clashes, trite crossovers) are the only weak points in the collection. Iron Man has always been a pillar of the Marvel Universe although often overlooked by fans.  Whether you are a comics fan looking for some of the classics or a pop culture fan looking for some 60s Cold War paranoia, this is the collection for you.  Shortly after the period contained in this collection, Tony Stark found his main adversaries in the persons of other corporate leaders.  I look forward to The Essential Iron Man 2 covering his battles against these corporate giants.	2001-01-04

Well, when FF#1 arrived on the scene, DC stories were likely to be Superman being turned into an Ant Superman or Lion Superman by red kryptonite, Jimmy Olson was turning into Turtle Boy, Lois Lane was constantly trying to trick Superman into marriage and Batman spent more time fighting aliens than he did fighting the Joker.  When DC had a good story idea, they had to trumpet it on their cover with &quot;Not a hoax! Not an imaginary story! Not an April Fool's gag!&quot;--DC was the pits!   Along comes Marvel (Atlas at the time) which specialized in Godzilla type monster stories.  Armed with  new concepts-humanized heroes, longer stories, &amp; continuity-the company took off.   This is where the Marvel Universe was born and although these stories are simplistic (FF fought to a standstill by a hypnotist!? defeats Impossible Man by ignoring him until he leaves?!), they are the bedrock of modern comics. Lee/Kirby deserve all the credit they get for rescuing the form from oblivion and raising the intelligence of the genre. I hope that the series continues at least through the first 100.	2001-01-03

The 6 issues of his original title run start off the book.  What starts as a promising run soon degenerates when the character is given shorter stories in Tales to Astonish.  It's clear that Stan Lee at this stage had no idea of where he wanted to take the character.  Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk at night...or when under stress... or just where the plot requires it.  There is no set plan for the character.  At one point, he even reverts to Bruce Banner when the Hulk is under stress.  How stupid is this idea when the Hulk is under stress whenever he meets a villain.  And the villains-aside from the early Leader stories and the brief 2 story Abomination origin, the villains are very lackluster.  One expects the early Marvel stereotypical &quot;Red Menace&quot; villains, but an evil major league pitcher turned mercenary under the guise of Boomerang?  As one of Marvel's conceptually weakest villains, he still  gives the Hulk a run for his money.  Of course, we get Betty Ross and Rick Jones thrown into constant peril.  The Hulk's identity is revealed only to be forgotten so it can be revealed again several stories later. He goes from an intelligent Hulk to the ignorant Hulk time and again with no rhyme or reason.   The original stories were published  over the course of several years and read as a group in several sittings, they suffer immensely. The reprint quality on some of these stories is horrible to say the least.   I'm sure the publishers used the best available archival copies, but several are very poor reproductions. For completists and rabid fans this book is a must, for anybody else it is a disappointing mess.	2000-12-28

When she wallops him with a copy of DH Lawrence's Women in Love, he makes a threat that will come back to haunt him.  She's found dead in the library of a wallop from a baseball bat.  A list of names followed by Bible verses leads to Jordy uncovering a multitude of sins among the population.  And why is his mother, an Alzheimer's patient, on the list?  The answer to that question leads to a profound change in Jordy's life.   Distinctively Southern in tone, Abbott's debut talks with a Dixie accent.

This book is of the 3rd variety and gives us the history of Hastur.  We get works by   Lovecraft, Derleth, Chambers and others while tracing the concept of Hastur in the stories.   This is an excellent way to get introduced to the classic horror of Chambers King in Yellow.  These eerie works are best in short doses as given here.  Couple that with a Lovecraft classic and a story by Will Murray (the hardest working man in pulp these days) and you've got yourself a feast of great horror stories.

Excellent stories, but especially noteworthy is the &quot;Purple Invasion&quot; set of stories where Op 5 had to contend with foreign invaders who had seized control of America.  The &quot;Ashes&quot; series rings with echoes of those great pulp stories.  After WW3, America is in grips of a brutal, yet American run, dictatorship. Ben Raines is the head of the Rebels trying to overthrow the ruling govt. and return America to democracy.   The first 3/4 of the book show Raines in his struggle with the ruling party.  The last quarter is a grim account of the world being swept by the Black Plague.  All in all, it's an exciting and worthwhile adventure with one proviso. Normally I don't mind a little sex and violence in my action fiction.  Heck, violence is an integral part of any men's adventure fiction.  What is disturbing about this book is the sex and there is plenty of it.  However, almost all of the sex portrayed in this book is brutal rape.   When the secret police are trying to get information from anyone in this book, they are, for the most part, raped, sodomized or forced to watch loved ones undergo the same treatment.

She's a loner on a homestead on federal land in Alaska.  She's a loner because she killed a child abuser years ago and it haunts her.  It left physical and mental scars.  All of this makes Kate a unique personality in mystery fiction.  But she also has friends-half the people on the tribal grounds are relatives and many of the others are good friends.  They add more unique flavor to this mystery.   Kate is called in to find a friend who went missing while searching for a congressman's son who is missing.  During the investigations, all of these unique personalities come together along with plenty of other local flavoring.   Dana Stabenow has created a compelling, sympathetic series family.  I hope to see a lot more of Stabenow and Shugak.	2000-09-29

As I read this wonderful Boston PI story, one thought kept coming to mind. This series could go bad real fast.  Searching for a politician's maid puts Pat Kenzie and Angela Gennaro in the line of fire of a deadly gang war.  Great story-wonderful characters-but this whole thing could go rotten.  Mr. Lehane, please please please DO NOT make Pat and Angie a romantic couple.  THe characters are just fine, but nothing ruins a series like that cheap TV sitcom sweeps stunt where 2 characters who had a definite tension, finally find the wherewithal to forge ahead with a romantic relationship (even worse when it graduates to marriage and a baby carriage). Mr. Lehane, I love these characters. Don't ruin 'em!	2000-09-29

Streeter reads like the 40s/50s Mitchum in one of his noir masterpieces. His antagonists are remarkably like fugitives from a classic Elmore Leonard novel.   The mystery is pure Spillane (blonde lovely wants to find drug dealing dead beau's money).  Michael Stone weaves all of this into an excellent tale that made me run out for the rest of the series.   Steeter is a wonderful creation.	2000-09-25

Not only is she faithful to her main character, but each book also brings us deeper into the lives of Beaumont's surrounding circle of friends and associates.  JP is called in on another homicide.  This one involves a young gay who told his mother he worked for the DEA but the Seattle DEA has no record of him.  Along the way to the solution, Beaumont finds himself involved with a lovely chanteuse out of rehab on the comeback trail and a drug ring whose territory covers the West Coast. Jance lets you think you know what's going on, then she pulls the rug out from under you.   Another great job from Jance.	2000-09-25

When Maureen Purchase and her daughters are found savagely murdered, her husband's alibi doesn't check out.   Playing cards?  At A bar?  Telling his lover he was going to leave his wife?  His 1st wife is glad the 2nd is dead, his son is claiming credit for the murders and his lover claims to not know him.  When his lawyer, Matthew Hope tries to get to the bottom of things, he can't tell the lies from the alibis and indeed Matthew Hope is lying to himself, as he promises HIS lover that he will leave HIS wife. All of this makes a compelling mystery and as delivered by Ed McBain, it is a great start to another series from the master of the police procedural.	2000-09-25

The town of Stirrup is in the control of the banker and saloon keeper.  Things are so bad that the doctor won't even treat a patient without the bosses' permission.   Into the conflict wanders a Texas lawman whose uncle owns a local ranch coveted by the vilains.  The situation escalates with gunfire and killings from both sides until a climatic blockade of the town by the ranchers.   What was published as a routine formulaic western reveals itself to be an exciting story of the type often filmed with Randolph Scott in the 40s and 50s.  One can almost see the noble Virginian actor striding onto the town streets with Ray Barcroft and Victor Jory as the villains.  This is great western fare for afficionados.	2000-09-20

Since these critics would hate to be  caught reading mysteries, the author is labelled a &quot;NOVELIST&quot; by  the critics and given a big push in the media.  It happened to Raymond  Chandler, Ross MacDonald, and John D. MacDonald among others.  why wait  until a deserving author is old or dead?   It's time to give early   attention to J A Jance.  Her work transcends the genre and becomes a tale  of characters-characters as well developed as those of a fine Dickens  novel.   In Improbable Cause, Jance weaves these characters into the story  surrounding a dentist who is a spouse abuser.  Why he was killed is plain.   Who killed him becomes an investigation of sympathetic characters, none of  whom you want to see arrested for the crime. When an ex-con is implicated,  Beaumont finds himself at odds with his superiors who would rather settle  for the obvious and easy suspect.  In a rather unique ending, Beaumont  solves the case and at investigation's end is covered with elephant manure  and commended by the mayor.    Although I had the killer figured early on  (gut feeling, not clue finding) ,  the story carried me to the satisfying  conclusion.	2000-09-19

You know, those  stories he wrote before McGee where a bunch of nasty characters get caught  in some nefarious scheme.  But it's subpar McGee.

Rather than romanticize Kling, McBain shows him on  a slippery slope which finally has him perjuring himself to obtain a search  warrant for the suspected lover's home.

This book tells how the Liberty Corps is formed in  spite of those reactions.   The beauty of the story is that rather than  focus on one character to weave his story around, Roberts follows several  enlistees through the process.   We get a womanizing Army regular  whose  punishment for an affair with a General's wife is a position with the  Legion, an undercover  reporter sent to do an expose'of the legion, a Mafia  soldier hiding from a NY Don and various other characters.  The novel  mostly covers their plight in the newly formed Legion.  The actual mission  does not occur until the very end. As an origin story, it does quite well  with more characterization than the usual series entries.	2000-08-15

In the  meanwhile, we get Carella reflecting on aging and recalling great moments  in 87th Precinct history (at one point, the reverie goes back to 'Cop  Hater', the 1st 87th novel).

Don Pendleton tapped into the psyche of an America coming to grips with increased  violence in TV and movies and coupled it with the examination of the Mafia  in Mario Puzo's Godfather.   He came up with an action thriller that  spawned both copycat Mafia series and a huge assortment of new action  heroes. Basically the story of  one man's vengeance taken to the ultimate  extreme, we see Mack Bolan go after the local Mafia in order to avenge the  death of his family-who ironically were not actually killed by the Mafia.   The story of vengeance escalates until Bolan faces the man who he  particularly blames for the deaths and comes away from the confrontation  with a surprising revelation.  This is truly an action-adventure classic.	2000-06-22

That is the surprise I had when I picked up this paperback original  and found an interesting story.  Jonathan Cain has combined the men's  action genre with the police procedural and come up with a winner.  This is  the 1st in a series about MPs on the streets of wartime Saigon. As one  charcter says &quot;we're cops first, then soldiers&quot;.  As in any good  procedural, the squad is juggling several cases at once.  Sometimes the  cases mesh, others are solved and added to the files.   Here we have a  psychotic prostitute, a deserter bent on revenge against his girl's  killers, and the hunt for perpetrators of war atrocities in a small  village.  Being a men's adventure paperback original, the sex and violence  quotient is higher than the usual big city procedural, but it is still a  good read.  While he's no Ed McBain, Cain shows a talent for weaving a good  procedural and I look forward to the rest of the series.	2000-06-20

I've read and enjoyed historical mysteries, but the vast majority seem to be stuck in Middle Ages Europe.  Although Christie had done an Egyptian mystery, it  was written in the 40s.   Now Ms Robinson comes along with a series set in the reign of young King  Tut.  Due to the upheavals caused by Pharoah Ankhnetan (spelling?) turning  to a new religion, the court atmosphere is one of intrigue as the ancient  priests re-assert their power. The 'detective' Lord Meren is a man who was  tortured and forced to admit allegiance to the god Aton and now wears a  brand with the sun god's symbol.  Meren and his son are called in by the  pharoah to solve a murder in the Place of Anubis, where the dead are sent  for mummification.  Robinson does an excellent job of conveying the  atmosphere without slipping into anachronism.  All in all, an excellent  book for fans of the historical mystery looking to get out of the Middle  Ages.	2000-05-31

Brown outshines the competition in this  adventure.	2000-05-15

What's wrong with that?  The essence of series writing is giving the fans a tried and true  formula for enjoying the adventures of a beloved hero.  Granted, one can't  take down their entire Cussler collection and read each in a row.  That  tends to exaggerate the similarities.  But for a quick fix every year or 2,  Cussler provides  great entertainment.    Inca Gold is another Dirk Pitt  treasure hunt which features an exciting race down an underground river in  search of Incan treasure.  All of the familiar characters are here along  with a group of villains out to stymie our hero.   If Clive Cussler wants  to write another 50 books featuring Dirk Pitt and his quests-I'll be there.	2000-05-12

Wert brings a balanced outlook to his story, disparaging some of the blame  that has built up.  When he feels that Longstreet was at fault he points it  out, but also manages to explain and disprove some of the false accusation.    For example, Wert points out that the timing involved in Longstreet's  leaving the Union Army and joining the Confederates shows that it could be  considered &quot;dishonorable&quot;.  Hopefully, a balanced account like  this will go a long way towards rebutting &quot;Old Pete's&quot;  detractors.	2000-05-12

Thus except for a hidden sniper scene, the book is pretty much bereft of any gunplay.  There are a couple of good fistfight  scenes.   After reading the first few scenes of the book, I was reminded of  the Spencer Tracy film &quot;Bad Day At Black Rock&quot;, a great movie  which is also a modern western.   Both book and movie deal with a war  veteran returning to find something about the family of a dead  brother-in-arms.  The similarities end there.  Silver Rock deals with Tully  Gibbs' efforts to mine a valuable but forgotten claim with his  friend's  father.  There is little action and a standard subplot involving a girl, a  jealous boyfriend and Tully's guilty secret.  All in all, a disappointing  effort from a Western Master.	2000-05-12

Sinister villains, lost races and beautiful priestesses are a mainstay of the series and this book introduces  the best of all.  Sinister villain-Nikolai Rokoff who would compromise his  own sister's honor for money. Lost City-Opar, the remnant of sunken  Atlantis.  Beautiful priestess-La of Opar, who passionately chases our man  Tarzan through several adventures.<br />Tarzan is marooned near his jungle  home and gravitates from civilized man to savage man to ape man over the  course of the story.  His realization that not all Arabs are sneering  villains and not all blacks are cannibalistic headhunters is a welcome  relief from the stereotypes that are usual in the series.	2000-05-11

A good  start for anyone interested in mythology who wishes to delve into the  Chinese tales.	2000-05-11

Ultimately, the mission  falls to IRA member Sean Dillon who makes an attempt on one British PM and  decides to settle on another.  This is not my favorite Higgins, it moves a  little slow compared to his other stuff, but the story is good and the  characterss compelling.	2000-05-11

This tells the story of a US space station that must direct US forces during a Soviet invasion of Iran.  Consequently, they find themselves the target of advanced Russian forces.   Plus a rare female protagonist in a techno-thriller.  Great work from a  master of the genre.	2000-05-11

Lee has been treated as a Southern savior, without blame for any of the failures of the Civil War.  In fact, in order to maintain the Lee legend, blame has been heaped upon others in order to save  the myth (James Longstreet comes to mind).  Nolan's book is a point by  point rebuttal of many of the trappings of Lee's story and backs it with  documentary proof.  At long last, some balance is added to the mix.  I also  recommend Freeman's 4 volume biography, but one should read Nolan's book  also to temper the hero worship found in Freeman's monumental work.	2000-05-10

When the hero saves the rich girl from death in quicksand (none too soon, she's standing on her horse's back when  he rescues her-the horse is totally submerged.), he thinks he's helping his  side but is soon caught in the middle of a sinister double cross.  My first  Lehman-I will eagerly search for more.	2000-05-10

It tells a fascinating story of the survivors of a shipwreck on the planet Darkover.   The crew faces the  problems of dealing with new lifeforms and their effects on humans and meet  with the mysterious Ghost Wind, a strange force which affects their  emotional states.  Very short ( an evening's read) as novels go, it is a  good introduction to Bradley, her Darkover series and would serve as a good  intro to science fiction in general.	2000-05-10

One warning though-the treatment of blacks, although standard for the time, is jarringly alarming in our time.   The story of the boy raised by an unknown  species of ape (surviving prehistoric primates?) is well known but slightly  tainted by numerous movies and tv shows that changed the image of  Burroughs' creation.  His discovery (and subsequent denial) of his true  origins make a poignant story coupled with the standard romance with Jane.    Other than the treatment of the native Africans, my only problem with this  book is his self taught education.  If Tarzan learned to read and write  English from children's primers and his father's books, how did he learn to  spell 'Kerchak'?	2000-05-10

From the top secret deep cover Russian training school to the chase through Nicaragua to  the final fate of the Russian mole, this is a book that will keep you in  its grip until your through it.  Although I'm not up on the aviation terms,  I found that I didn't get lost in technicalities as you do in some  thrillers.  Dale Brown writes a mean adventure novel even with the jargon.   Besides they give you the glossary for tech terms BEFORE the story. Pick it  up, you're in for an exciting time.	2000-05-10

I was mildly surpried that he doesn't find them here &amp; there around the West and kill them one at a time.   Instead, the reader is taken on a journey of vengeance where Edge  encounters various monsters in human form before he finally reaches the  town of Peaceville and exacts his revenge.  Not a traditional western, this  is an ultraviolent attempt to bring  Mack Bolan-style action to the genre.    Taken on its own terms it's a worthy effort indeed.  Not for the faint of  heart.	2000-05-10

(See JRR Tolkien.) JRR Tolkien-Creator of the definitive FANTASY TRILOGY, often imitated, never duplicated. That being said this is the first book of a  FANTASY TRILOGY, so we know that it is of epic proportions.  It doesn't  leave me eager for more, it leaves me hoping for better in pts. 2 &amp; 3.  We have the standard guilds: Bards, Healers and Rangers-(oops, that's  Tolkien, sorry). In this trilogy they're Heralds. The standard apprentice  (of course, an outsider among her own people, but golly gosh, so  misunderstood and golly gosh, she's capable of great power, why she may  even be the most powerful among her guild) , the standard animal companion.  I've read other of Ms Lackey's books and she is capable of much better.    I'll continue on into the rest of the trilogy and hope it reaches the  heights of  the Gryphon series.	2000-05-10

Mcclellan: The Young Napoleon	Books	3	15	19	N	N	Good History, but not enough analysis	I picked up this biography after reading Sears' &quot;To the Gates of Richmond&quot; which fascinated me with it's portrait of McClellan.  Always suspecting he was being conspired against or being faced with  overwhelming  enemy forces, General McClellan has got to be one of America's most  paranoid military figures.  I hoped that a book devoted to his life would  add some insight regarding this failing in a supposed military genius.   Unfortunately, although the book reinforces the charcter of McCLellan with  further incident, I finished without getting the feeling that I understood  the sources of his fears.  I've loved Mr Sears' other books on the Civil  War and its various campaigns.  The high quality of his other histories  left me a little disappointed with this outing.	2000-05-10

Doc Smith's classics are back in print, so bring your sense of wonder.  I prefer the Lensman series to his more melodramatic Skylark series and this is the intro to the classic that finished 2nd to Foundation in the best  series category years ago. Starting near the beginning of the universe, the  story hops from distant galaxies to Atlantis, Rome, and the world wars.  It  shows the ages old conflict between Arrissa (Good with a capital G) and  Eddore (Evil with a capital E) and sets it agains the backdrop of human  history.   We meet the Kinnisons, whose descendants will carry on the  struggle against Eddore in the years (and sequels) to come.  Although not  as riproaringly fast paced as the rest of the series, Triplanetary serves  as a handy intro to the series and sets the stage for adventures where  solar systems and galaxies will be spanned in seconds.  Pick it up and get  ready for some good old time space opera--this is the 1st of the sciece  fiction style that culminates in Star Wars.	2000-05-10
