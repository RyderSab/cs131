Ms. Thomas has been on every show in America promoting her book, but when I sat down and just read the book I was not impressed.

As a manager for many years, I came away from this book with a sense that I was being lead astray. The author is hardpressed to come to any sort of conclusions that are meaningful and he seems to just fill the pages with words. He might be a good typist, but as a writer he has much to be desired. There is also an ego problem here too. The word I is used so many times that I felt like the author was advertising himself, instead of trying to help managers like myself. This is not a good book!	2002-06-01

He spends a great deal of time disecting the past and most of what he talks about is more suitable for a magazine article than a book. He talks about certain stocks and trades that happended long ago and when these trades took place  they might have had some importance to Cramer's story, but that was a long time ago and the material really comes off flat and stale. On a personal note, I have to say that the publisher has done Cramer and the reader a great disservice by putting the most unflattering picture of Cramer on the cover.

The claim in the book that Cramer used the anchors at CNBC for his own ends gives readers an interesting behind-the-scenes look at Wall Street. The author makes a convincing case as to why Cramer and CNBC staff worked together in inappropiate ways that were not in the best interest of average investors. Hyping stoks on CNBC and then selling the same stocks in your personal account is wrong! Also, the part where Cramer gets tips from analysts about stock upgrades, etc before they are released to the public is a great bit of news. All believable. What I found to be not right with the book is the lack of writing skill and story development. Here we have a book that is filled with stories about Cramer yellling, being verbally abusive and throwing things. This is material best for water cooler conversation and does not find a true home in a book. The writing style is rather flat and the narrative at times seems to go no where. Furthermore, the book is streched to be completed at 200 pages, because of a seemingly lack of material. This is not in the style of Liar's Poker, but it does give readers a dark look at some of the happenings on Wall Street.	2002-03-05

He has a simplistic view of whales and people. He thinks of only domesticated, well-trained whales that appear in shows for entertainment. Here he misses the mark completely!! He thinks that by being good to whales you will bring out the best in them and he applies the same sort of unreliable logic to people.

In other words, reward people when they do good as the whale trainer does when he gives the whale a fish for jumping through a hoop. I wish life was this simple and managing people this easy, but dealing with complex relationships is far harder than giving simple rewards. The basic premise of this book is that people are like whales.To assert that managers can command people to do what they want by simple rewards is silly, naive and just downright dumb! No company that I know works this way. There is office politics to consider, personalities to contemplete and power players to acknowledge. This is what it is like to work in an office, which is much more complex than the simple reward system that Blanchard advocates. People are more complex than whales and while this book may be a whale of an idea it is not a book that carries much weight.	2002-02-12

First, after reading a few chapters of this book I never bought into its premise. There is no secret code and if there was I don't think a writer like Mr. Glassman would know about it. The writing is average, label-like reading that won't win any literary prizes. But the key element that I found most discouraging was what was not in the book. There is no new information here that makes the book a buy. You would think there would be since the information, at least from what I gleaned from the title, has been a secret thus far. This book is all about marketing and hype and shame on the author for trying to convince readers otherwise	2002-01-08

Everything I have read by the author tells me that he thinks in the long-term, but now to write a book about why investors should consider the short-term is indeed a contradiction. I read the book cover to cover and I did not find a secret. What Glassman calls a secret is basically standard investment advice that he has talked about for years. His last book Dow 36,000 looked at the market long-term and as of this writing his prediction for the Dow has not come true! There is really no secret to good investing and what troubles me is that Mr Glassman, an experienced investor, does not know that, or maybe he does??	2002-01-08

Nonsense!!! In my view if you want to find yourself invite some friends over to your house, go out to dinner with a loved one and find some romance.

What is so amazing is that Dr. Phil thinks we have multiple selfs and that just by shere will alone we can go from our untrue self to our real self. Ridiculous! He gives a layman's definition of self that philosophers would cringe at and goes on and on with stories that fill the page, but don't further the subject matter. He paints the self as stagnate, but it seems to me that it is fluid. I mean, afterall are we the same people that we were 10 or 20 years ago?  Dr. Phil is good at selling books and dishing out simple ideas, but as a reader I wanted much more!	2001-11-14

I just love the title. I don't think smart and the Internet era go together too well and the New Economy idea has come and gone. The authors of this book are probably very young and with youth comes inexperience in financial markets. The Street.com is a web site dedicated to financial information(like this book I think), but The Street.com has never made money and the company's stock is a penny stock. The Street's so-called experts write about about making money, but don't you think that if they really knew how to do this they would have made money themselves. Better luck next time.

Of course not, he would be on his own private island sipping a soda. This book is more about marketing than informing. It uses old examples to prove its points, but these examples are far from convincing and really don't apply to the market in general. What readers get here is a small book(it is not even 200 pages so I guess the market has little to say)with a picture of Ron on the front. I wanted more for my money!	2000-10-08

The author brings nothing new to the table and he  repeats old news stories over and over again to the point of making the  reader fall into a deep coma.I don't buy new books to read old news  stories. Most of the material is &quot;ancient&quot; in that it took place  a few years ago and any respectable investor knows that Wall Street is all  about today or tomorrow--not what happened in 1998. He puts CNBC, Jim  Cramer and others under such a microscope that it becomes silly. I really  don't care when Maria gets a cup of coffee or Jim clicks his mouse to buy a  stock. Give us something we care about it and can learn from--not a book  based on old news and yellowing newspaper articles.	2000-09-01

There should have been more information offered for the price. What I did  find interesting though was that the author rails against corporate america  and publishing conglomerates, yet his own book is published by one of them.  Moreover,the author says that because readers are into new age and don't  like to think for themselves publishers like to print new age books that  are distantly removed from common sense and critical thought. The reason  for this is that those types of books sell well. Well, if this is indeed  the case, why was his book published? The problem in the book is that the  good professor falls victim to the harsh generalization fallacy. He gives  examples and then paints with too broad of a brush. This is a common  mistake form people who think they know it all, but if they did they should  have known better in the first place!	2000-08-28

At first glance it seemed to have some important information and a positive slant, but further examination proved otherwise. Sadly, Ms Lerner goes out of her way to say critical remarks about authors that I found personally offensive. For  example: &quot;Writers love to worry. By their very nature they are  neurotic.&quot; And if this isn't enough another blast, one out of many I  might add, comes later on: &quot;The only place you're likey to find more  alcoholics than an AA meeting is in a writing program.&quot; She  consistently uses a broad brush in painting authors as having pychological  problems and being indecisive and makes no aplogies for these harsh  generalizations. It seems to me that the author goes out of her way to  insult her audience and the people who have provided her a living for many  years. After all, Ms. Lerner states that authors create and editors just  provide energy, but does that energy have to be negative?	2000-04-06

Outside of this minor inconvenience the rest of the book is a joy to read, especially for diehard Sagan fans like me. The author does a  good job in paintng a picture of Sagan( warts and all) that makes the  reader have a better understanding of his subject. The chapters on Contact  and Cosmos were the best and the insights into Sagan's character make the  book an excellent buy.	1999-10-12
