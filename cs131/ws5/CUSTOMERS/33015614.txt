I thought it was fantastic ... in every sense of the word.  When I started reading it, I was not expecting it to be so fantastical and sci-fi-esque (which I'm not typically a fan of), but it was great!  I had a really ahrd time putting it down because it had just enough mystery to keep me completely engrossed.  And Coupland's writing is, as always, magnificent.  His humor never ceases to amuse and his novels never cease to amaze.  I wasn't expecting it to really make me question my life and the way I live it, but it definitely did just that.  It's a great book that makes you think.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Coupland and you're used to his style ... by all means ... read it.  You'll enjoy it.  However, if you're not a fan already and you're looking for a book to get more acquainted, try Hey Nostradamus! (in my opinion, his best novel ... and also the first of his I read), for it might ease you in a little slower.  Rather than before jumping headfirst into Coupland with this book.<br /><br />All in all ... an amazing story.	2005-10-06

I first read it my freshman year of college in the midst of taking multiple lit and psych courses (Lit major, Psych minor).  I immediately fell into this story.  I loved the \\"Is she crazy? or are they real?\\" questions.  And the morbid and fascinatingly brutal ending.  Because I was such an avid reader and very deep into my studies of psychology, this book fit perfectly into my studies.  I was originally going to write my thesis on this book, but in the long run, it has proven too redundant.  Every one and their grandmother has written their interpretation of the story and it became impossible for me to have an idea of my own.  But, the one thing I truly love about this story is that it is STILL considered one of the best thrillers of all time.  At the time it was written, this kind of psychological thriller didn't exist.  I suppose it helps to have a famous psychologist for a brother.  This story did for thrillers tales what the exorcist did for thriller movies.<br /><br />An amazing book by an amazing author.	2005-10-04

Beautifully written with two very real characters that you really know by the end.<br /><br />I, like most others, read this book for a freshman high school english class.  However, unlike most of the students, not only did I actually read it, I loved it.  I thought it was one of the most true books I had ever come across.  It seemed to be a rare thing for me because of my taste in \\"literature\\" (I was a huge reader of R.L. Stine in my early teens ... I know, I know ... awful), but this book really opened my eyes.  It made me appreciate true, honest, non-fear street teeny-bopper books.  This book changed the way I read and definitely changed my appreciation for simple and beautiful stories.  I think this book could definitely be the reason I became a literature major.<br /><br />A must read ... especially for young adults ... an astounding truth.	2005-10-04

I had just read A Home At The End Of The World and was desperately in need of more fantastic literature.  I assumed that this novel would be just as great, if not even better.  Well, I made an ass out of you and me.  I found it boring and rather difficult to get through.  It was a quick, easy read, but I was bored to tears through most of it.  I think I only got through it because I was eager to finish it and move on to a better book.  The only reason it gets any stars at all is because once again, I am sucked in by Cunningham's writing.  I wouldn't say DON'T read it, because I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who adore this novel and I'm sure they are right, in their own way.  Personally, however, I didn't enjoy it near as much as I'd hoped.	2005-10-04

However, I think it's because of the way that she writes this novel that makes it so captivating.  It's terrifying and romantic, it's seemingly unbearable and it's light and easy.  It's definitely the best of both worlds.  A romantic and thrilling tale of love and evil.  Who doesn't love that?  Not to mention the writing is second to none.<br /><br />But, regardless of how much I love this story, I did have to take a star away just because of how many times I had to stop and go, \\"wait ... wha?  erm ... but I thought ...\\"  And yes, in the long run, it makes the book that much greater, but it can get frustrating (especially for one not used to that type of reading) and confusing.<br /><br />But, yeah, a true classic.	2005-10-04

Breathtakingly beautiful, to those of us who are slightly twisted and love a little madness.  The language, although sometimes confusing, is truly beautiful, if you just take the time to read it.<br /><br />I'll admit, I read this originally for a lit class and I hated it.  I didn't get it at all.  Looking back, I think I hated the class, not the book.  And the professor, but we won't get into that.  I appreciated it, as a classic novel, but I didn't enjoy it at all.  However, because I am hardcore, I reread it about a year later on my own time and I absolutely loved it.  I think it was just a matter of slowing down and reading it for myself rather than for some class.<br /><br />So, kids, let this be a lesson to you.  Just because you hate it in high school or college ... does NOT mean it's bad ... it just means you need to reread it.  Dammit.	2005-10-03

I'm a literature major and there have been many times where I'll like and appreciate a book, but it doesn't mean much to me ... it's just another novel in collection.  But this book was moving.

It was far too redundant.  It was the exact same thing I had read twice before.  Except this time they were in LA and everyone was attractive.  I live in Palm Beach, I don't need more hotties in my life.  I need realistic gay porn.  Dammit.  Heh, ok, kidding.  But, it was just too cliche'.  I couldn't bring myself to finish it, despite my best attempts.  I was bored out of my mind.  AND ... for back up ... my dear friend who turned me on to Rice in the first place couldn't stand the novel either and refused to finish it.  So, I don't think I'm alone on this one.  It's not bad ... but it's not worth reading either ... especially if you've read his other two novels.

I bought it knowing nothing about it simply because I was about to go on a long car ride and needed something to keep myself entertained.  And keep me entertained it did.  I was completely enveloped by this book.  It's been years now since I read it, but I remember it like it was yesterday.  Not many books stay with me like that.  I saw the movie and was relatively disapointed.  Not terribly surprised though, this was hardly the type of bookt hat would be easy to put into motion.  It's one of those novels where you need to create your own visions of the characters rather than have some casting director tell you what they look like and how they act.  Not a bad movie all together, I think it was the best they could have done.<br /><br />But, it was a beautifully written book and an excellent read.	2005-09-30

It made me want to go hang out at the local psychaitric facility.  When I found out it was based on a book, I knew immediately it was a must read.  And it was amazing.  Not what I was expecting, at all.  I went into it expecting a novel and memoir, what I got was much more real.  And much more true to what I imagined life at a mental institution would be like.

The ultimate sacriledge for any book lover.  But, c'mon.  Seriously.  It was a decent book, I won't deny that.  It kept me entertained, it kept me reading, but in comparison to the movie - eh.  I honestly believe that the only reason this book became so well-known and so huge is simply because of the movie.  And all those kids out there dying to belong, read it and accepted it ... despite it's many flaws.  Despite it being a pop-culture novel.  Sad truth is - they don't really know any better.  However, I won't completely knock the book down, it was amusing and had some of the best one-liners of all time, but I'll stick to the movie for now.<br /><br />PS - I am in NO WAY knocking Palahniuk ...

Typically, I'll get bored with a book of 900-some-odd pages, I have a short attention span and am easily side tracked, but this book not only held my attention, but completely enveloped me.  I couldn't put it down.  Every page is necessary and every word is purposeful.<br /><br />I actually came upon Wally Lamb by accident.  My crazy step-grandmother gave my mom a stack of books as a birthday present (all clearly used), and my mom barely has time to sleep, much less read.  So she gave them all to me.  \\"She's Come Undone\\" was amongst the books and after reading it, I knew I had to read any and everything else by Wally Lamb.  I highly recommend any of his writing.
