It's a must read for the multitude of Java/C#/C++ developers who continue to write procedural code while claiming they're OO developers because they're using an OO language and they've read Design Patterns.	2004-07-15

I think he falls badly short of the mark.  He's got a tin ear for dialogue and with interior monologue he's even worse.  That is a major handicap to an author who is describing a descent into madness, and at the same time it is precisely what Jim Thompson excelled at.  Further, Starr seems to lack a voice of his own.  It seems impossible to consider the book on its own without comparing it to others in the genre.  Overall it is a very forgettable book.	2003-02-19

Think of John Irving when he was writing books that weren't just great, they were risk-taking, colorful and fun.<br />This novel is successful on many levels.  It's an engaging love story.  It's an homage to the New York City of the 1930's and 1940's.  It's a history of the early comic book industry.  It's a study of the symbiosis between life and art.  There are a host of characters minor and major, all skillfully drawn, and a story spanning continents and decades.  Though the book is overfull with symbolism, allegory and verbal games, none of them hinder the progress of the story.<br />(In fact, if I had one complaint, it is that some of these were too obvious: in escaping Prague, Josef Kavalier hides in a box with the Golem of Prague; when he gets to New York, he teams up with his cousin Sam Klayman.  The comic book hero they create is called \\"The Escapist\\", etc.)<br />In all, it is a novel well worth your time.	2001-10-29

The best evidence of the fine writing in this novel is a back cover blurb that gives away much of the plot, yet in no way diminishes the pleasure of reading the book.<br />Basically the story follows Brat Farrar, who successfully assumes the identity of long presumed dead Patrick Ashby to inherit a fortune. What sets the book apart is the development of Brat's character. His feeling and motivation is examined sympathetically, and in many ways that is what drives the novel.<br />There are a number of minor shortcomings to the book. In contrast to the wonderful development of Bee and Brat, the character of Simon is drawn fairly shallowly. He seems to be a bit of a stock villain and his motivations are never examined. Also, the ending was a little to pat. It doesn't seem likely that the scenario could be wrapped up as cleanly and quickly as indicated in the book. But apart from those quibbles it was, all in, an excellent book.	2001-08-30

Such sloppiness is grave warning that the book itself is very likely a hasty and slapdash effort.<br />In that expectation alone I was not disappointed.  What the author says is true.  The techniques he describes for free writing are helpful.  (Thus the three stars.)  But in communicating the technique, he seems to have taken the worst elements of self-help guides, how-to books and management gurus, and not added any original thought.  <br />The book can be read in one sitting with ease, and for the most part, it reads as if it was written in one sitting.  There are many good books about the creative process and writing.  I would steer potential readers away from this one.	2001-08-14

He's a fine author though, and he writes a compelling Western.  Comstock Lode was the first of his novels that I read, well over ten years ago, and found it to be an enjoyable treat.  His stories are rich in accurate historical detail, yet not overwhelming.  His writing style isn't literary, but it's good. His characters are reasonably three dimensional, especially in comparison to other writers of Westerns.  (I find Zane Grey nearly unreadable.) Most of all though, his books are fun. <br />This book in particular recounts actions in and around the greatest single discovery of silver in the United States. Though the particular details of the plot have long since left me, during a recent visit to Virginia City, years after having read Comstock Lode, I was able to explain to my companions why the cemetery held the remains of so many from Cornwall, England.  So I can say that at least some part of the book has remained with me over the years.	2001-03-22
US	53005885	RKE8EDOBNVPBX	0679463321	565707898	Killing Time	Books	1	9	11	N	N	Dreadful.	Utterly abysmal.<br />Doc Savage novels have more literary sophistication and more believable characters.  <br />The book is dumb.  For a successful author to cross over genres, and write such a stupid, insipid book shows more than laziness or ineptitude.  It shows either contempt for the whole genre and its readers or a total lack of understanding.  What's most upsetting is that the book purports to address two really big ideas: &quot;Information is not knowledge&quot; and &quot;The world wants to be deceived.&quot;  A science fiction novel that did address those ideas would have been great.  In fact I've already dug as deep as the author does.  In the hands of a Philip K. Dick, this could have been a fantastic book.  In Caleb Carr's hands, it is just awful.<br />For some reason, powerful enough lead them into extreme danger, but which bafflingly is never explained, a band of hoaxsters travel the globe spreading disinformation through the Internet generally and in many cases doctored video clips.  Everyone believes their faulty information and fake video (even though it's 2023 and 30 years since Forrest Gump shook hands with JFK.)  Then they decide they've gone to far and they have to catch someone who believed one of their hoaxes.<br />Their amazing ship is powered by &quot;super conducting magnets&quot;.  It somehow uses magnetism to levitate above the earth and propel itself under the ocean.  It masks itself with a &quot;holographic projector&quot;.  While being pursued and attacked by the most sophisticated weapons of advanced nations of the world, the ship is defended by a magnetic shield and the &quot;rail gun&quot;, which uses magnetism to superaccelerate metal pellets. <br />Early on, the hoaxsters shake the foundations of Christianity by &quot;discovering&quot; a new apocryphal gospel.  That's stupid.  There are dozens of apocryphal gospels in existence already.  Further, if the actual behavior of men in the Church's name wasn't enough to cast doubts aboutits provenance, another apocryphal document probably won't work.  The &quot;discovery&quot; of a 5 million-year-old human skeleton in Africa shakes the foundations of science.  That's stupid too.  In fact the scientific community recognizes that it is the scientific method itself that has proved most able to reconcile results in conflict with widely held theories.  <br />The presumable engine behind the action through the book is the search for a Mossad agent bent on detonating a nuclear bomb in Russia. Why is he so angry?  He saw fake footage of Stalin visiting a working Nazi concentration camp.  Why did this set him off?  Of course much of his family had been killed in Nazi concentration camps.  But this is 2023.  Which means his parents and grand parents were not alive during the war, and his great-grandparents would probably have been to young too have children, so it was probably his great, great grandparents whose deaths he was avenging.  Yet, inconceivably Germans don't face the brunt of his anger.  And apparently the Mossad agent is ignorant of the long and sometimes violent history of anti-Semitism of Russia.<br />I don't know what happens next, because I am abandoning the book with 100 pages to go.  It is just that bad.	2001-02-02
US	53005885	R2NOQ7STEKPK0L	052159233X	80680050	Modelling Financial Derivatives with MATHEMATICA &#174;	Books	2	41	42	N	N	A complete muddle	In the preface the author sets out four goals which he hopes to accomplish.  <br />The first is to show how Mathematica can be used as a derivatives modelling tool.  Technically he does show how Mathematica can be used for derivatives modelling, but with virtually no insight about what makes Mathematica special.  The code he writes could trivially be ported to FORTAN, Visual Basic or C.  In fact, based on his experience as a practioner, one suspects these models were hastily converted to Mathematica from C.  In so doing, Shaw shows that he entirely misses the point of  Mathematica.  <br />In Gray's excellent book, &quot;Mastering Mathematica&quot; he proposes a fundamental dictum of Mathematica programming: &quot;Treat mathematical structures as wholes.  Never tear them apart and rebuild them again.&quot;  Yet Shaw does precisely that repeatedly throughout this muddle with his &quot;Mathematica implemenations&quot;.  Shaw devotes a number of chapters to implementing PDE algorithms in Mathematica with no mention of Mathematica's own PDE solvers.  By ignoring them, we are left wondering if Shaw found them inappropriate, inadequate, or just didn't know about them.  Shaw devotes half a chapter to comparing the relative speeds different methods for obtaining normally distributed random numbers, while just mentioning the included Mathematica function &quot;NormalDistribution&quot; as just another candidate.  While this discussion might be interesting for some, it is irrelevant to his stated purpose.  The whole point of Mathematica is to do mathematics, without low level programming, and Shaw just doesn't seem to get it. <br />His second purpose is to present a complete if concise development of the mathematical approach to the valuation of a large class of derivative securities.  He failure here is not as obvious.  There are about 20 to 25 well written pages explaing the mathematical background of derivative pricing.  But there isn't anything in those pages that isn't covered far more clearly in a dozen other places.<br />His third purpose is to present a balanced approach to algorithm development including analytical, finite difference, tree and Monte Carlo based solutions.  He is successful, but frankly, by this point, who cares?<br />Fourth he intends to highlight the mathematical pathologies that exist in many derivative modelling problems.  In this he is most successful, and one wonders why other authors seem to underweight the importance of this.  For this alone, I gave him two stars rather than one.<br />Finally, given the number of typos and poor typesetting,  the price tag of $150 is offensive.  You would be far better served to get Wolfram's &quot;The Mathematica Book&quot;, and Hull or Wilmott on derivatives (and probably still have some money left over.)	2000-10-10

If the proof of understanding is the ability to explain the concept simply to a layman, this author doesn't truly understand string theory.  He also  fails to understand why string theory is elegant, because he does not  succeed in explaining that either.<br />The lasting impression I got from the  book was that among the universe of scientists, the bulk of them do  uninspired, derivative, mediocre (albeit necessary) drudgery.  While  certainly they uncover truths, truths that merely quantify rather than  elucidate the subject aren't interesting to read about.<br />More  importantly it seems that the string theorists in the book seem to be doing  either physics without experiment or mathematics without proof.  Such  activity at best leads to theories which describe the universe by  coincidence, and at worst leads down the path of the ancients -- a  mathematical physics that appeals to beauty and symmetry rather than proof  and experiment.<br />On the positive side, the book has an excellent section  on the special and general theories of relativity, an adequate explanation  of quantum mechanics, and a very clear section explaining their  contradiction.	2000-09-20

What's right with the book is that it is entertaining  and informative.  He supports his thesis with hundreds of fascinating  historical and economic anecdotes.  While interesting, even casual students  of economic history will realize that these anecdotes are no substitute for  a comprehensive (and especially quantitative) analysis.  On the other hand,  such anecdotes are eminently more readable for the casual student.  I  enjoyed the book greatly, though I disagreed with the author in some places  and felt he was guilty of sins of omission in others.  The book is  thoroughly footnoted, with a massive bibliography for the reader who cares  to dig deeper.  But make no mistake, the book is a popularization, not an  academic tract.<br />I take issue with other reviewers' claims of the author's  racism.  I found him to be extremely even handed in his treatment of  sensitive issues.  This sensitivity and evenhandedness was surprising  because early on he makes promises of being a radical iconoclast of  politcal correctness, promises which I don't believe he ever delivers on.	2000-09-20

Populate it with millions of different  races, and connect it with a galaxy wide information network.<br />A human  colony attempting to &quot;transcend&quot;, using information found in an  ancient archive, instead unleashes a &quot;perversion&quot; on the galaxy.   Two children escape to a medieval world populated by dog-like creatures who  share consciousness as packs.  With them they have the possible  countermeasure to the evil that was released.  Two humans and two sentient  mollusk/machines race to retrieve the countermeasure and save the  galaxy.<br />There are really two stories here, and either might be enough to  power its own novel.  There are two big issues here:  What would life be  like in a universe where gods were many and observable, and godhood was  difficult but obtainable?  And, what is the nature of consciousness, memory  and self?  The author powers these questions with &quot;Space chase&quot;  and &quot;Marooned on a backward world&quot; to generate the tension. It  works well.<br />However, on the downside the book never really addresses the  philosophical issues head on.  After getting fleeting glimspes of them in  the opening pages, Vinge continues on almost mechanically, referring  tangentially to the questions, the implications and the possibilities the  world which he has created.  Deeper meanings seem just out of reach for the  remainder of the book.  <br />The book is valuable and a worthwhile read,  because it makes one think, but at the same time I think Vinge gets off  easy, because he never lets the reader know what he thinks.	2000-09-18

It is quite short  and assumes a good bit of knowledge of the plague and of general European  history.<br />He addresses three issues.  First, he points out that historians  really can't be sure of the composition of the plague itself.  Was it  actually all just bubonic plague, or some combination of various other  diseases?  Second, what were the economic effects of the plague?  Did the  relative scarcitity of labor following the plague break Europe out of a  'Malthusian deadlock' into a growing economy?  Finally, what was the effect  of the plague on the social order?  Did it help to Christianize  Europe?<br />The book is written in a fairly academic style, but it is very  readable.  My biggest complaint is that is so short.  I wish he had written  more.	2000-08-11

It stands alone in its field.  And if you're reading this you're probably going to buy regardless of what is written here.<br />But I've found this book (along with some of the  other Fabozzi 'Handbooks') to be overrated.  Basically, the format of 30 or  so different authors each writing a chapter in the form of an article  diminishes the usefulness of the book.  There is no narrative, pedagogical  or otherwise. The format leads to significant gaps in coverage.  The  quality of the chapters is uneven, as is the level of detail  covered.<br />Don't misunderstand me -- the Handbook isn't bad, by any strecth  of the imagination.  It's just not as good as it could be.  It has almost  no fluff, and all the information in it is good.  And the competition is a  very slim field.  For many things Fabozzi is not only your best choice,  it's your only one.	2000-06-27

The mechanics of passthru trading are extremely peculiar, and like no other traded security  in the world.  Ironically, though passthrus are extremely simple  securities, the process through which they are cleared is more complicated  than that of their derivatives (CMO's, IO's, PO's, etc.).  This book, takes  you through the process in a clear and intuitive manner.  If one were  designing a trading system for MBS, this book is the blueprint.<br />However,  the book is PAINFULLY boring.  To be fair this is the fault of the subject  matter, and not the author.  This is not a book about the mortgage markets  -- it is about the back and middle office.  Do not buy this book unless you  are actively engaged in, soon to be engaged in, or are bizarrely interested  in the clearing of mortgage backed securities.  You will find it unreadable  otherwise.	2000-06-27

Donleavy uses the academic setting to create situations with a tremendous  amount of humor and a profound sense of loneliness and alienation  simultaneously.<br />This introduction led me to pick up four more by  Donleavy.

The historical background is excellent, both in the details and the broad issues.  The characters are fairly well developed.  The structure of the novel is interesting and adds dimension.<br />Now, the  bad news.  There is no tension.  None.  The other qualities are good enough  that the book may have worked had it been a third its size.  But when  you're reading the same series of events for the fourth time in a row (in  great detail), merely changing the point of view does not generate enough  tension to painlessly keep up the level interest necessary to fully follow  the various subplots.<br />Another minor problem is one of which many writers  of historical fiction are guilty.  The good guys are those who are most  sympathetic to modern sensabilities, and the bad guys uniformly embrace the  prejudices of the day.  Pears writes in the first person, and in describing  the prevailing attitudes of the day he is not convincingly  sympathetic.<br />One final problem. A significant portion of the denouement  is pretty predictable to anyone who has watched too much TV.<br />In the  book's defense I think comparisons to the Name of the Rose are unfair.  Eco  writes Literature; Pears writes mysteries.  And regardless of my other  criticism, it is a mystery certainly more intelligent than most.	2000-04-05

(If they weren't neither Asimov nor Heinlein would ever have sold a book.)  The payoff is that the  readers are supposed to get deep, thought provoking ideas in return.  The  'First Contact' story is a vehicle for some of these deep ideas that has  been used hundreds of times over the years, and in The Sparrow, Mary Doria  Russel gives us her version.<br />There are some neat small ideas about  linguistics and anthropology, a couple of big ideas about comparative  anthropology, and at least one really big idea about faith and the nature  of religion.  The relative merit of these thought provoking ideas versus to  the woodenness of the characters and dialogue is net positive and the  author is clearly competent.  However, the book left me flat.  That was  because ultimately the ending just didn't deliver.  After spending so much  of the book leading up to it, the climax and denouement seemed hurried, and  after enduring hundreds of pages of Emilio's other thoughts and emotions,  Russel never successfully communicates just how profound his feelings of  confusion, abandonment and hopelessness must have been.  <br />That said, the  book was good enough that I do expect to read the sequel.	2000-01-03

Jaynes addresses this question, among others, in one of the  most thought provoking books I've read.<br />Basically, he posits that lacking  full consciousness (yet having language), prehistoric man's actions were  often governed by voices, which are in many ways similar to certain forms  of schizophrenia.  His full argument is much deeper and far more subtle  than I can deliver in a one-line synopsis.<br />The book is not a drum-beating  New Age manual for making peace with our proto-selves, although many  readers seem to have taken just that away from his discussion on the  origins of religion.<br />The thesis is, of course, utterly unproveable, and  both orthodox classicists and anthropologists are at odds with it.  But it  is remarkable in its originality. One needn't be convinced by the book to  enjoy it; read it purely for Jayne's breadth of knowledge and his  originality of thought and it will be well worth your time.	2000-01-03
US	53005885	R30PXC3QQVAJGA	0553562738	466136665	Doomsday Book	Books	4	5	7	N	Y	Should have been better	The book conssists of two intertwined stories, that of the student going back to study the Middle Ages and the 21st century academics trying to rescue her.  The former is outstanding.  The characters are real, the  detail is fine, but even more, the unspoken inferences about medieval life  and society drawn by the reader are the most fascinating part of the book.   However, the latter  is disappointing.  It is at times plodding and clumsy.   Attempts at comedy are misplaced and the characters are two dimensional.   This 21st century portions really took away from the meat of the book.	1999-12-21

The coffee fueled plot generates no tension, and the hero generates no sympathy.  The novel said to me &quot;I'm so good, I can write  about anything and make it meaningful.&quot;  No you can't.<br />There was  also an annoying (to me) lack of attention to details.  A pilot suffers  under multiple G forces when he pulls out of a dive, not when he pushes the  plane into it.  The chemical nomenclature a professor uses to describe  caffeine did not come into use until decades later.  I realize that these  are piddling complaints, but they become distractions when much of the book  is devoted to the author showing off how much he knows.<br />A number of  reviewers claim that this is his worst book.  I hope so, but even so based  on my feelings about this one I don't see myself reading his others any  time soon.	1999-12-21
US	53005885	RJHC8H3YIKLXR	0679741755	103612792	Mapping the Next Millennium: How Computer-Driven Cartography Is Revolutionizing the Face of Science	Books	1	1	4	N	N	Horrendous	This book is a collection of unrelated &quot;expositary&quot; essays on  current developments in science.  The theme of &quot;mapping&quot; is  forced and really doesn't work at unifying the chapters.  The book has  little or nothing to do with developments in computers or cartography.  The  author shows little comprehension of what he writes about, especially in  the sections devoted to mathematics, and his original thought is fairly  shallow.  Don't expect it to come back in print.	1998-10-14

The discussion of random number generation is worth the price alone.  Also neat is the discussion of why numbers with lower initial digits are 'more common' in practice than those with higher initial digits, a topic I've never seen treated elsewhere.	1998-03-05

It's a refreshing book to read because it takes as its premise (and its tone) that the financial industry is morally abhorrent and parasitic.  In places the author goes even further and takes a few swipes at capitalism in general.  This sets it apart from most other books in the genre.  But frankly it goes to far.  The book is too one-sided in its presentation to be useful as a learning tool, and reads much more like an op-ed piece than reporting	1997-09-04

That said, this book was a thorough disappointment.  Midway through I kept thinking he must have had a contractual obligation with a publisher to come up with a manuscript, because this novel was just a pretty good short story inflated to a few hundred pages	1997-06-13
