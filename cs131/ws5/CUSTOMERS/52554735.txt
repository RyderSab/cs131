Specifically, business folk, insurance, and those investing in the future would clearly benefit. I also refer to it when planning my career, advising others or if Im presenting and it has information I can draw from.	2005-08-22

If Conseco was sincere in wanting to provide a clear, informative picture of the use and abuse of steroids in Baseball, why not provide a minimal index.<br /><br />Infact he avoids most scientific aspects; being unwilling or unable to describe doses, specific steriods or types of HGH.<br /><br />He casually and unpredictably mentions side effects.  The actual useful information in this book is about 5 full pages, the 'story' is about another 5 pages. Jose's opinion and grand standing takes up the rest.<br /><br />All told, it's a ok story and I'm glad Jose told it. It could have been done much more informative though.	2005-03-04

Time better spent on the net	My biggest problem with this book is that it lacks an index so its mediocre format is especially painful. Having been qualified as a calvary scout (19D)and lately interested in Psych Ops (37F) I found information on both MOSs lacking.<br />A good portion of the book is dated including the many useless forms. Any forms you'll need your recruiter will have online.<br />A good example of the complacent editing this book has undergone:<br />Under U.S. Army - Popular movies listed include Private Benjamin and G.I. Jane (Navy Seal Drama).<br />I recommend instead researching on the internet and finding service specific literature: For instance the books by Robert S. Rush for those interesting in the US Army. Also the downloaded game from the U.S. Army website is also a great resource.	2002-12-21

The New Jedi Order has highs and lows but Traitor is a zenith - with suspenseful plots and subplots and the cleverly ambiguous title; there are many twists and turns all the while enhance Jacen, Nom Anor and Vergere's characters consistently and deliciously.<br />If you enjoyed the beginning of the series but got lost somewhere in the middle this will refresh and reinvigorate your interest. If you'd enjoyed them all then you'll be especially well rewarded with this story.<br />Its hard to praise it more without giving away more of the story but with Jacen in question the drama is intense and<br />the final scene very satisfying.	2002-08-15

The book is an exceptionally well written history, explanation and fore telling of the world of Robotics.<br />Told with the expertise of a ongoing participant Rodney Brooks is clear and especially well informed well beyond his clear knowledge of activity on MITs campus. He describes activity from Standford and CMU to Cornell and, of course, his own AI Lab at MIT. He also discusses succinctly the Japanese robotic effort and recent products by Sony.<br />For anyone wondering about emerging trends, the potential of robotics, or the potential of artifical intelligence (AI)  this book is a treasure.<br />Each chapter includes a rich bibliography.

I was recommended this recently book while visiting my old Philosophy Advisor while in Boston. I've been hooked ever since!  While for me it has been a great review of logic, the problems and ability to have them anonymously graded on the net is great fun!  At the end of chapter 3 one is already versed well enough in logic to use the more complicated search engines with boolean operators. (altavista advanced for example). Being able to use sophisticated search engines will prove to be more and more valuable and this book offers so much more.<br />Along with a rich and entertaining text, you get a (WindowsXP friendly) CD including four software applications: (Tarski's world, Fitch, Boole and Submit) all with the goal of making logic more interactive.<br />Tarksi's world offers a view of 3D geometric objects in which one is required to make true, then valid and eventually sound conclusions.<br />Fitch is a tool that lets one build FOL (First Order Logic) Proofs.<br />Boole is a truth table tool.<br />All applications compliment each other and are suppoted by Submit on the client side and Grade Grinder on the Server Side. So that one is never left too long without some feedback on whether or not the section has been understood.<br />The books website offers additional tips and hints.	2002-02-17

Of course the same is true for gaming and the convergence of the two is<br />the altruistic message of Marc Prensky's book.<br />Mr. Prensky's book points to the future with promises and warnings supported by a rich amount of research, as demonstrated by his footnotes and bibliography.<br />We let the TV pass by without carefully planning how it could be a force for complementing education. Lets not make the same mistake with the net!<br />This a wonderful eye openner for those that have underestimated gaming (play)  and its importance to learning.<br />Just the quotes at the beginning of each chapter make the book compelling and can immediately reveal opportunities in most scenerios. Each chapter is thoughtfully layed out with interesting examples/case studies and methodically introduces a group of concepts then builds to a thoughftul and often unpredictable conclusion.<br />The book is rich with facts and statistics - some of them, while revealing the potential in redirecting gaming, are still frightening.<br />&quot;Each day the average teenager in America watches over 3 hours of television, in on the internet 10 minutes to an hour, and plays 1 1/2 hours of video games.&quot;<br />In fact this seems conservative to me, but if Marc is right, there is an incredible amount of untapped potential in reaching America's youth and this book is a deliberate first step.<br />Finally a book both gamers and game designers can love, students can share, parents and kids can discuss and left and right brains can savor.	2001-11-12

It offers a vision of how VMS works, but less specifically how an Operating System works and even how a technology book should be written.  Folks that have written about Windows NT have sited this book as their inspiration and most folks supporting VMS would rather part with almost any other technical resource.<br />Ruth is an unparalled writer but also a stellar troubleshooter and a great instructor.<br />Not just a technical work of art but also a delight with a whimsical mix of philosophical and poetical quotes putting each technical concept in context.<br />Denise Dumas's contribution is not to be underestimated, a maven in her own right, she has clarified and complemented where few would be able.	2001-07-28

This books has served as a reference, but more than that a reminder of where I am, how far I have to go and the tools to get there. Bo has produced a book taking the best of Yoga, self discipline, pragmatism and  compassion and produced a ruthless guide to self-growth.	1999-06-20

(pg 144) for instance. Aside from that it is an excellent book with some very insightful  tips and explanations.	1999-04-03

We both love the book. It clearly explains many topics better than most other sources and has a clear  organization for such a substantial reference. My first literary source now  for Yoga guidance and clarity. thx &amp; namaste	1999-04-03

It tells the story of overcoming adversity on many levels.  Sadly neither the sequel (Tandia) nor the movie (same name) reached the same heights. Still a wonderful story, great images and a  clever ending.	1999-02-08

Walter tells a personal uplifting story then gives useful steps for ones own self fulfillment. Do yourself a favor and  buy 2 copies, since as soon as you read it, you'll think of someone who  needs it more than you do, and you won't want to give away your copy and  its too hard to find in the book stores.	1999-01-01
