It's OK but totally predictable and it comes off as phony and made up, which is strange for a book that purports to be so real. Also, this book aside, I think a more interesting tale would be an analysis of why Oprah consistently picks such negative, depressing books. She sees herself as the queen of positive thinking, but she urges readers to wallow around in negative novels. I don't get it. I wish she'd recommend something uplifting for a change.	2005-09-27

This book is as good as the others, although, as everyone knows, the tales get darker with each book. (Frankly, I liked the first one best and wish they were all more light and fun.) But there is humor here amid the darkness, and it's always uplifting to read tales of good versus evil. Don't you wonder why would some fundamentalist  groups seek  to ban Harry Potter books when the books do, in fact, teach such important lessons of the power of GOOD over evil? The Bible is full of such tales. Reading that good can triumph is an important and inspiring lesson for children and adults alike, especially in today's scary world. <br /> <br />Rowling remains a powerful writer and visionary.  Rowling's out-of-the-box vision is one thing but the fact that she can put that vision into words and make it real for the rest of us is utterly amazing.	2005-07-25

A new Mitford book.\\" And I wondered how I'd missed it. Once I got the book in hand, I realized I had not missed anything. This is not a new Mitford novel but a little story with some other previously published stuff thrown in. It's a big disappointment. I was so annoyed to realize that I'd paid a book price for a little story that I didn't even enjoy the story itself. It isn't the money, actually. It's that I was all set to relax and be drawn into Mitford again for a nice long visit. This short story sent me packing far too soon. Someone needs to let this author know that her readers are waiting for another REAL Mitford book. I won't buy anything like this again.	2005-07-14

If you've taken one of the basic personality tests, you've learned that people are wired differently---that some are extroverts who find energy by being out with others and others are introverts who can only reenergize by being alone or with small groups of people. If you didn't know that, this book will explain it and make you understand that there's nothing clinically wrong with you if you're an introvert -- you were born that way.  Beyond that, the book fails to explain the \\"advantage\\" of being an introvert.  There are lots of successful introverts and lots of ways to put that personality to use, but she fails to explain that.  She could do a better job, too, of clarifying that being an extrovert does not mean that you cannot find peace during alone times and that being an introvert does not mean that one cannot be successful when out and about with other people. It  is simply a matter of where one best recharges one's batteries.	2005-06-27

The fact is that Edward Klein may be a bestselling author, but he's achieved that by sensationalizing his subjects and doing little, if any, new research. He cobbles together secondhand stuff from other sources and is known as someone who does not do research. He'll pass on rumors and lies.

Or they have not read it carefully. The prayer  in this small book  is simply about opening oneself to what GOD wants and intends for us. Period. The biblical passage on which the book is based simply points out that we humans (who have free will) have to ASK for God's blessings. The prayer is simply a variation of \\"Ask and ye shall receive\\" or \\"God helps those that help themselves.\\" I can't imagine what some of the fearful book reviewers find so scary or unorthodox in that.

Some of her advice is sound, but some of it is not up to date and seems aimed at the 1950s housewife, which she probably was at one time herself. The worst part of this book (and her columns) is that she herself comes off as not all that well-mannered. She often suggests snippy, snide retorts to people, and she lapses into what sounds like nouveau-riche snobbery vs. well-bred, well-mannered behavior and attitudes. Don't buy this.

I do wish that the writer (isn't she a lawyer?) would stick to the evidence and keep her personal opinions out of her writing, however. As a former debater myself, I was a little disturbed (and a lot annoyed) by  the writer's opining as she labelled Scott a sociopath. Or, is the writer also a psychiatrist?

The people about whom he writes are largely middle class--upper middle class, perhaps, but \\"middle\\" nonetheless. For better or worse, I would argue that the \\"bobos\\" are not, in fact, running the country, either. He gives them far too much credit in terms of their supposed \\"power.\\"  And George W. a bobo? Hardly. He's as elite and old money as they come; it's just that he has a Texas twang! I also would argue that the group about which he writes is nothing new.

Unfortunately, I was given this book for my birthday, and I agree with the readers who said it's drab and dull. They could have put all the style ideas in this book into a pamphlet. If you want cookie-cutter style just like your neighbors, buy this. If not, keep looking for a decorating book that offers more originality and spark. This one's a dud.	2003-11-11

A broad range that includes some very high-end items as well as funky flea market finds. Great mix. Great style. I love it. Refreshing to see rooms that aren't cold and stark. A lot of the magazines I get have settled on the same interiors month after month, which are spare and bare and lack personality. nice to see real people who obviously are passionate about what they collect and who aren't afraid to put their stuff on display.	2002-12-03

I love the show but it had become a sort of travelogue last year, which was fun to watch but didn't give me much in the way of ideas for my home. This book seems to put Lynette back in the mode of a decorating teacher (or cheerleader), which is what i liked about her shows over the years.

It starts with an intriguing little house on a traffic island somewhere in California. I must have studied the pictures of that house a thousand times by now. But it has ideas, from storage to room arranging, for homes of somewhere around 2500 square feet or less. The square footage is listed with each house. Many are between 1000 and 2000 square feet. It's about time. McMansions in my neck of the woods are running 4,000, 5,000, 6,000 square feet.. Obscene. I wish  more builders and architects would get on board with reasonable home sizes again. This book proves that a small house of 2500 square feet or less can live big.	2002-09-10

It has EVERYTHING. I've gone through so many books that propose one philosophy or one style or some other very narrow topic. What I needed was THIS. I needed some grounding in interior design so I could understand how everything might go together in our own home. Few books explain anything beyond the author's own point of view these days. This one explains the basics so I can make my OWN decisions. What a breath of fresh air. I found just about every style in here but I agree with one reviewer who said there isn't a lot of &quot;contemporary&quot; in this book -- thank goodness for that. I laughed when I watched a recent Trading Spaces episode in which the homeowners and the host were yelling, &quot;No contemporary!&quot; My feeling exactly. I did notice that this book (a bargain, by the way) is a soft-cover edition of a book that came out five or six years ago, so that probably explains the overriding traditional and cottage feeling. Fine with me. I'm looking for classics.	2002-09-10

It's the kind of book we can flip through for ideas because the photos are great. But we also can get answers to the kinds of decorating questions other books never seem to address. Finally, the book presents optional solutions for each common decorating question, so we can begin to see how we might actually decorate our own rooms. I highly recommend this book for anyone, like me, who is stuck in a builder beigs house or apartment and is yearning for some color. It's also a great guide if you're ready to buy some new carpeting or repaint your walls, because it tells you how to pull rooms (or your entire main floor) together.	2002-08-22

I've been addicted to her TV decorating shows for years. When I saw this book, I knew I had to have it, and I wasn't disappointed. This is a big, heavy book stuffed with lots of photos. In the book, Lynette writes as if she's just talking to me about how to decorate my home. Reading this is more like having a conversation than just reading, because Lynette asks questions, makes me stop and think, and even admits that she has trouble decorating sometimes. A wonderful gift book to give yourself or anyone who loves Lynette and appreciates her down-to-earth approach to decorating.	2002-02-06

He's a pyschic, not a writer, and he should stick with telling his excellent real stories based on his amazing life.(I have similar reactions to Chopra's fiction. Why do these spiritually talented people feel a need to move into fiction?)	2001-02-05

I agree with those who say the prose is wonderfully sparse and the novel gripping and seductive. However, I find much of the writing too studied -- to the point of pretentiousness. Sometimes,the descriptions seem so carefully, almost painfully crafted that one is more aware of the struggle of the writer than of the imagery itself. That awareness actually comes between the reader and the story at times, jarring one awake with a great desire to tell the novelist, &quot;Oh, puh-leeze. Just say what you mean and stop trying so hard to be clever.&quot; Unlike some reviewers, however, I am not troubled by the enigmatic ending, because it reflects the very nature of such events and the human response to them. I like the fact that the author did not insult the reader by attempting to neatly wrap up the story by coming to a firm conclusion about Mariette's stigmata at the end.	2001-02-02

You don't have to have a vacation home to love thumbing through this book. And you don't have to have a second home to get decorating ideas from this book. Our style is best called &quot;nautical&quot; or &quot;seashore,&quot; and one of the best little decorating ideas I've gotten and used so far is to use oars as curtain rods in our bedroom. There is a breezy look to the homes in this book that I can use for years as I create a light and airy getaway look for our home. This is a great book.	2001-01-19

My favorites talk to me all the time. So, that claim simply isn't true. Second, I did like looking through the book, but there wasn't anything new in it about decorating in my own, albeit eccentric way. Again, that message (about doing my own, often quirky thing) comes through again and again in all the decorating TV shows, magazines,and books that I already enjoy. The thing about this book is that it doesn't speak to me all that well. In part,it's because the rooms aren't very well-designed. Some are downright tacky. I think a lot of readers will find these settings hard to relate to. I'm giving my copy of this book away, because it doesn't have any lasting value for me.	2001-01-09

I only found it by accident when I searched for vacation home books. It's hard to explain the appeal of this wonderful book. It's inspiring.It's dreamy.My best friend said, &quot;You aren't planning bo buy a second home now, are you?&quot; I said, &quot;No not yet. But we hope to someday.&quot; So, this is a &quot;someday&quot; kind of book with yummy photos of great second homes that real people own. It is a beautiful, big book. Beyond that, it's a book that gives me hope, because it includes very practical tips on everything related to second home buying, building, remodeling, and decorating. I like to dream within the world of what's really possible, and this book makes me believe that my second home dream really can come true. Someday. In the meantime, I'm doing what the book promises and getting away just by looking through the book.	2001-01-05

We looked and could not find any other books that were as comprehensive as this one,which is all about how to work a fireplace into one's overall room design. I personally found the room arranging ideas helpful, and I also have rearranged objects on our mantel, using ideas from the book. My husband is using ideas from the book to figure out where to put the fireplace into the master suite that we are adding on.The fireplaces shown range from modern to trraditional, country, Victorian, and everything in between. Some are old, some new, some woodburning, some gas. I even learned about new editor-approved electric fires that mimic the real thing. I also liked the fireplace makeovers, because we hope to change the style of ours (which more than 20 years old) in the near future.	2000-11-22

Adirondack Style is more of a dream book and includes historical information about the style. It's also limited to one style, of course. The book called Second Home works on a couple levels as a dream book but it also includes information on shopping, building, decorating, and so on, and it shows a wide range of second home styles around the country. We like both, but if we had to pick only one, it would be Second Home. (A book called Cabin Fever is fun, too, but limited to very rustic styles.)	2000-11-02

Without understanding that, I either have to apply the ideas exactly as he shows them or look elsewhere for background information on decorating that will help me understand the principles of design. As an attorney, I am used to working with that kind of logic. Give me a conclusion or an idea and then explain how you arrived at it. It's the knowing of how one has arrived at the idea that allows others to learn from it.  As I see it, this book is all about simply applying this or that idea (and applying lots of &quot;decorating&quot; to surfaces, from walls to windows) without understanding how one arrives at a decision to do so.	2000-10-27

It's OK. Yes, there are some ideas here, but there is great potential for creating clutter, too. I looked for some tips along the way to help me understand how to put it all together but I didn't find anything like that. I need more basics! Without that, what you have in this book is a smattering of OK ideas that may or may not add up to a well-designed room in the end. So, pick and choose projects from this book carefully, and then look for another decorating book that explains the basics so you can actually put a whole room together.	2000-10-19

The only way to preserve one's reputation as a TRUE journalist,which Mr. O'Reilly is NOT, is to maintain a balanced perspective. Obviously, this man has lost that sense of balance. The STORY matters -- the journalist's opinion does NOT. In this case, I cannot say that I am shocked that THIS so-called journalist has forgotten that basic tenet of journalism, because his low standards were evident years ago when he hosted a pseudo-news tabloid TV show. The surprise was that Fox News dubbed him a &quot;news anchor&quot; and gave him a pulpit for his biased views along the way.	2000-09-22

I'm passing mine along to a local library. If you have a husband, children, and a  career, and, together, you ALL manage to keep your house in decent shape,  then forget this book and get on with your life. If I want crisply ironed  sheets and dress shirts, I send them to the laundry, for heaven's sake. Of  all the do-it-yourself projects for which I'd like to find time, keeping  house is not even on the list. This book probably is a good reference book,  which is why mine is going to our library, but if you are among the people  today who are trying to simplify their lives in order to find time and  space for what is really important (i.e. people, activities, life), then  forget this book. When you get to your final days, will you want to look  back and say, &quot;Oh, yes, I dusted well and ironed all my kids'  sheets,&quot; or, &quot;Didn't we all have good times together? Didn't I  always make time for those I loved? Didn't I make time to prepare wonderful  meals? Didn't we have FUN?&quot;	2000-08-17

Such wit, charm, humor-and light! Since then I have read most of  his books and have several of his audiotapes in my car, too. He never fails  to make me laugh at my own failings-and keep going in spite of them. He  also has helped me achieve a greater understanding about other people's  failings, too-and what I can learn from them. His basic spiritual  philosophy does not change, of course; after all, it is centuries old. But  in his various books, he applies that philosophy to different situations,  thus deepening and enriching my understanding of it. Now he applies his  practiced spirituality to aging and dying, putting a whole new spin on the  basic premise of learning to let go. This is a winner. All of his books  are. I don't know if I will be able to laugh at my own death, but Ram  Dass-with his humor, humanity, and wisdom-is helping me step back and  consider my life and eventual passing in a more peaceful light. Light being  the operative word, of course.	2000-08-15

I can't SEE anything. One vague exercise after another. Example: Look at the rooms shown here.    &quot;Find three words ... that best express your reaction to each      room. Write the  words on note paper and stick on the      photograph...&quot;  AND THE  POINT IS? The exercises will continually leave you hanging. If they are  connected in some way, then one would have to spend hours and hours going  through this book like a textbook.<br />The tips in the book also lean toward  the vague side.     &quot;The elements that make up an architectural style  are numerous      and varied. That's why it is important to consider each       detail to determine which features are the most attractive      and  least attracitive. No space is perfect, but by paying      attention to the  details you can make every space work      decoratively.&quot; AND THE  POINT IS? What do I DO about what I have just read? I dunno. I get so  frustrated when a book that looks and sounds interesting ends up being a  vague mishmash of photos (mostly of places that bear no resemblance to the  typical American home, by the way) and non-specific writing. Another  example is a page simply called DOORS, that shows 6 badly shot (shots are  cut off in a strange way, too) photos of doors with a vague caption that  telle ms that doors are decorative elements, that one can look at salvage  places for interesting ones, and repeats, &quot;Don't overlook doors.&quot;  Well, great. Could be be a little more specific here?<br />Also, the book  seems big and heavy, but they used heavy paper, and it's really only 160  pages. A ripoff.	2000-07-27

It tells  little stories of each home and owner but leaves me completely on the  sidelines. If I'm not interested in these people (and, in general, I'm  not), then the book has nothing for me at all. I was expecting large and  lush photos and some information that I could use in my own getaway home.

I will keep it -- probably to give to someone else on a birthday or other occasion. But I found it simplistic, kind of selfish, and oddly negative. I couldn't relate to the  kinds of experiences she described in her own life, and she didn't do a  good job of getting beyond HERSELF to help the book's contents relate to ME  and MY LIFE. She does not do a very good job of HELPING OTHERS do and then  interpret the exercises, either. It's difficult for me to admit this, but I  found that I didn't have much respect for the experiences this author  describes in her early life. In terms of the book's content, she describes  how she basically messed up her life from youth on, so it's taken her  decades now to climb to this point she has reached. She HAS reached a good  point, and I respect that and aspire to her kind of optimism and power. I'm  glad she's risen out of her troubled past, but she created that big deep  hole from which she had to rise in the first place! And, again, her writing  did not help me to relate to what she wrote about or use her experiences to  help me in my own life.	2000-04-13

For me, it captures the  fun of going to flea markets and using those little treasures to  personalize my home.	2000-03-23

I wonder where this author has been for the last decade or so, because it seems that she has just discovered that it's OK to break the  rules and be yourself when you decorate your home. Personal style has been  the big thrust in design for a decade or more, and my favorite home  magazines and books have always, always advised people to do their own  thing and forget what the neighbors will think. The idea of this book is  fine, but, my goodness, it's old, old news to most of us. The book also is  wordy, and I longed for her to get to her point more quickly. So, the  concept of the book is dated as is the writing style. Kind of old-womanish.	2000-03-13

I love color, pattern, and wallpaper. (Have you ever tried to find  a book that shows rooms decorated with wallpaper and tells you how to decorate with them? They don't exist.) Until I saw this book (by accident at the  book store), I could not find a book that gave me this much information on  how to decorate the way I like to.

The writing clearly explains everything, and the photos show the widest possible array of styles. Too many decorating books today focus on  just one style or mood, which I find limiting.I like to change my look and  colors over time, and this is the kind of book I'll use for years, because  the variety in it will keep giving me ideas.	1999-12-15

The first book was fun and fanciful -- a little scary but it ended on a high note. The second book was a little darker. I was disappointed with the utter gloominess of  this 3rd book and I can see that the series is becoming more profoundly  scary and disturbing than I want my 8-year-old to be exposed to. Yes, we  are both enjoying the books, and I'm not one of those right-wing Christians  who objects to books about wizards and witches. But, if the 3rd book is any  indication, but the books are becoming too dark, for lack of a better word,  for children. It's a matter of the balance shifting in a way that runs  counter to the promise of book one.	1999-11-22

And there isn't any help in figuring out how to use the color variations. I sat here and flipped back  and forth, entertained for awhile before I realized that this wasn't really  going to help me figure out colors for my house.

So, no matter where you live, if you love  rustic style, you'll be inspired by this book.	1999-08-10

What I learned is that the author has told us how to build a wonderful small house -- but the kinds   of details and materials she  advocates will produce a small house that costs as much as a large one!

I wanted so much to love it and be inspired-but I don't and I'm not. The author comes off as a patronizing snob instead of the warm friend I was expecting.  Instead of sharing positive experiences with readers, she clearly sees  herself as above them. Even her language is pretentious. When writing of  the kitchen, she refers to the &quot;larder&quot; and the  &quot;buttery.&quot; Puh-LEEZE. The book contains only eight photos -- all  of her own uninspiring rooms. It's not that there aren't ideas here-there  are many good ones in between the ridiculous tips. It's just that the  over-all tone rarnges from off-putting to simply boring.	1999-06-14

The approach is wonderful, because it reaches deeper than the usual money books that take the heart and soul out of the topic. Money is about so much more than mere dollars, and that's what this book explains. (Maybe that's  why some guy don't get it.) Also, regarding the earlier reviewer's negative  comment, there's rarely a good excuse NOT to take a 15-year mortgage. Do  the math -- it costs very little more every month (and costs tens and tens  of thousand LESS over the life of the loan.) It's wonderful advice. Maybe  that's why we  had our first home paid off before we were 40. Duh! Thanks,  Suze, for this book!!!	1999-03-24

This book goes a  long way toward educating the public about the value of smaller,  better-designed homes-in most cases architect-designed structures that may  not be less expensive but that offer more &quot;bang for the (building)  buck&quot; over the long haul. My complaints about this book have more to  do with the visuals than with the good tips contained in the writing  itself:  * Too many of the homes shown are weighed down with heavy woods,  no doubt due to the writer's Prairie-school bias, which gives the book a  prevailing gloominess.   * When one potentially light and airy, two-story  living room is shown on page 10, it's photographed EMPTY (and thus looking  cold) with the writer's comment that the room obviously was designed not to  be comfortable but to impress. How can I tell if the room isn't even  furnished? Although of a different style, another two-story living room on  page 172 appears equally &quot;cold&quot; yet is presented in a positive  light.   * Much of what's shown is dated, from numerous round windows ('70s  style) to some of the furnishings. I love modern classics, but many of the  rooms and furnishings in the book fall into the simply &quot;dated and  tired&quot; category.	1998-12-17
