He is a regular contributor to Prevention Magazine and knows more about nutrition and health than anyone on the planet.  I get the feeling, while reading his books, this man writes to give information, not to make money.  He does have a line of supplements but ALL proceeds from sales go directly to supporting the growth of integrative medicine.  His \\"Eating Well for Optimum Health: The Essential Guide to Food, Diet, and Nutrition  \\"  is full of  practical advice and his reasons for giving it are sound and logical.  You won't find the desired quick fixes here, no miracle cures or empty promises.  Dr. Weil is one man who lives by the adage, \\"You are what you eat\\" and he does a fine job of passing along all the information to help you make more educated choices and less excuses.  Dr. Weil emphasizes diet as an \\"important influence on health\\" and this book gives you the basic principals of eating well.  What some people might dislike about  \\"Eating Well for Optimum Health\\" is how it puts the responsibility for your  health squarely on your own shoulders.  I recommend anything by Dr. Andrew Weil if you're really looking to take charge of your health and are willing to make the necessary changes.  EXCELLENT!!!	2005-08-28

Certain rules always escaped me and my punctuation never appeared where it was supposed to.  I lived too long  without consistently using \\"it's\\" and \\"its\\" in their rightful place and I shamefully admit, \\"who's and whose\\"  routinely gave me pause.  For a small book, it sure packs a mighty punch.  \\"Woe Is I\\" utilizes very small lessons, some just a short paragraph.  The reader is never bogged down with lengthy instruction or boring details, just the facts and some examples are all you really need.  This is a great little handbook that teaches a little, entertains a little and is a valuable asset for everyone, young and old alike.  You're never too old to learn or relearn how to get it right.	2005-08-28

The reader is transported to India and to the depths of Ms. Hadley's soul.  This was a poignant tale of a mother's attempts to connect with her estranged daughter after traveling to  New Delhi.  Along the way, the reader is treated to all the beauty of the country as well as the beauty within this determined mother.  Her heart struggles to connect with a person she loves but couldn't be more different from.  Veronica lives in self imposed poverty  under the guise of a spiritual quest.  She lives free of  responsibilities or convention and has nothing but criticism and disdain for her mother's more traditional lifestyle.  One is left to wonder how the two might ever find common ground but then you realize this story IS THE common ground.  It's the journey, not the destination that matters and the attempts to reconcile and the lengths Ms. Hadley goes to achieve this endeavor are proof of her love.  By the end of the book, I tired of Veronica's pontificating and holier than thou attitude and wondered if a reconciliation would ever be a good thing.  Leila Hadley's writing is incredibly pictorial, full of emotion and completely absorbing.  I recommend \\"A Journey with Elsa Cloud\\" as well as Ms. Hadley's other books, \\"Give Me the World\\" and \\"A Garden by the Sea\\".  All three are treasures.	2005-08-17

It is a saga filled with adventure, intrigue, fantasy, and just the right balance of humor to keep young minds engaged.  It's a hefty tome and reading the first few chapters to your kids will get them hooked and motivated to continue reading this classic on their own.  I found it to be a compelling and totally charming read.  With characters like Olaf One-Brow, the Beserkers, and places like the Valley of  Lunatics, you can only imagine what is in store between the pages.  I found \\"Sea of Trolls\\" to be totally enchanting.	2005-08-16

The message that comes through says  even though no one is perfect, they can find their own voice in the world.  This is a story of courage, honesty, redemption, and most of all, love.  I was touched by Louis' determination to repay his father's debt and  impressed with his strength and character.<br /><br />Kids and adults will love this classic by E.B White and it makes a great addition to your collection. \\"The Trumpet of the Swan\\" has my highest recommendation because it teaches as it entertains.	2005-08-16

Just like a portrait, it shows the princess at her best.  This is not an expose and I'm glad it wasn't.  The most poignant sections of the book are the parts dealing with Diana's tragic death.  There are copies of Elton John's handwritten lyrics for \\"Good-bye England's Rose\\" as well as many of Diana's own letters.  I received this as a gift, right after seeing the Diana exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in Fort Lauderdale.  Many aspects of the exhibits are included in the \\"Portrait\\" and I think will be enjoyed by any fan of Diana's.  It is a very flattering portrayal, as it should be.	2005-08-14

Her words leap off the page and take you inside the story  to enjoy her travels, right alongside her.  \\"Give Me the World\\" is so much more than a travel log or journal.  Ms. Hadley invites you  along as her guest and urges you to see and feel what she has experienced, to be a part of her journey.  You come away with an intimate knowledge of the Far East, as much as if you had seen it all yourself.  I enjoyed my time in Bombay,Bangkok, and Singapore and recommend it to anyone who has  a spirit of adventure.  \\"Give Me the World\\" was an experience not to be missed.	2005-08-14

Not because it was riveting in a \\"must know\\" sort of way, rather I didn't want to leave  Sweetwater , South Carolina, or little Emily.  They became my home.  Emily had been left too many times for such a young girl, I needed to stay and make sure she would be okay.  Ann Rivers Siddon's writing was so descriptive, so engaging, I became lost in this beautiful place.  I angered at Walter who had everything of value before him and wanted only what was beyond his grasp.  I loved Emily for desiring and appreciating all that was in front of her and for having the sense to know what was really important.  Emily saw all the beauty in her world while her father was constantly in search of something outside of his. That young child had a maturity beyond her years and I had to remind myself she was just a child.  In the end, this was a \\"coming of age\\" story.  A story of love and all too often, loss.  There is beauty between these pages and I think it's destined to be a true classic. Highly recommended!	2005-08-11

Of course, you'll find the \\"regulars\\" here but along side them are recipes for fortune cookies, moon pies, elephant ears, and my absolute favorites, stroopwafels.  The later being those wonderful caramel filled waffle sandwiches that you set  atop your steaming cup of tea or coffee to heat prior to savoring. In addition to the hundreds of delicious cookies, bars, and biscotti recipes, the bakers included icing, ganache, and glazes to top everything off.  This massive collection is great for the seasoned baker as well as the beginner since they start you off with basic instructions and an introduction to baking terms.  King Arthur Flour has the most extensive collection of baking supplies you will ever find under one roof.  Their flour's quality is miles above the competition and their ingredients are just superior.  What I love the most about the \\"Cookie Companion\\" is how they don't push their retail business, this is just about helping you make the very best cookies imaginable.  I'm getting a few more copies for Christmas gifts.	2005-08-11

I opened the book with a little trepidation, knowing this was most probably the last time I will get to read a new Shel Silverstein book.  I quickly got over that and realized Shel's books were meant to be savored and read over and over again. As with \\"Where the Sidewalk Ends\\" and \\"Falling Up,\\" \\"Runny Babbit\\" was written by a man who was just a little kid at heart.  I had trouble reading it out loud the first time but kids won't miss a beat. His books bring out the kid in all of us and are the most perfect gift for the young and young at heart.  All Silverstein books are priced  inexpensively to make them more accessible to kids, a huge plus since his books are keepers and givers.<br />HarperCollins must be joking when they list this book for ages 9-12.  I think they missed the mark by about 30 years.<br />Very highly recommended!	2005-08-07

Steven Levitt presents some interesting facts that will make you want to research further.  Reading his take on the public school system was validating as it has been my opinion all along.  Seeing first hand how standardized testing preparation has been substituted for  a real education and then reading how all it really does is encourage cheating was powerfully  illuminating.  The abortion statistics and the ridiculous baby naming trends offered valuable insight.<br />I see this as a primer on sociology more than economics but it does show how it is all related.  I will pass this one around  because I think it is an important read.  Maybe not for all the information included but for how it opens your mind and makes you want to look further.  I enjoyed \\"Freakonomics\\" and recommend it.	2005-08-06

The requirement to be independently wealthy or having just won the lottery.  When an author sells his book for $20.00 and then reveals inside that you will need items totaling over $1400.00 more to reap the full benefits, he's assuming  people are gullible and desperate. Going by Amazon ranking this the #2 book in sales, he may be right.<br />There is nothing in this book you won't find in a copy of Prevention magazine except for the referral to his website to buy his over priced products.  As I've said before, lean proteins, lots of fruits and vegetables, and plenty of water will do the trick for most of us.  I would discourage anyone from eating the amounts of salmon called for by the program unless you're sure your liver can handle the abundance of toxins it will now have to process.  I hear there is a great liver cleansing diet out there, just in case.<br />I bought \\"The Perricone Promise\\" and read it with high hopes after seeing Dr. Nicholas Perricone on a talk show.  It sounded good but I quickly realized it wasn't anything that was workable for the average consumer.  Really!! the prices of these magical creams are outrageous and he won't guarantee the results without them. As an example, he sells a bottle of \\"N.V. Perricone Neuropeptide Facial Conformer\\" on Amazon for  $570.00.  This item promises to reduce fine lines and wrinkles and improve skin's appearance.  I marched my copy back to Barnes and Noble and promptly got a refund.	2005-08-04

Hundreds of Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Martini	Books	5	349	376	N	N	Funny and educational	\\"Why Do Men Have Nipples?\\" was big fun.  I have to admit having had some of the sillier questions take up space in my head for years.  You aren't going to find answers to life or definitive information on the origin of the universe here, just some of the more interesting facts we can't live without.  This book had me laughing out loud, sometimes at the questions, sometimes because the question was ever asked in the first place.  I am proud to say I already knew why your teeth chatter in the cold or with a fever (body trying to warm up) and sucking the poison from a snake bite wasn't such a good idea. I didn't know the average desk in the average workplace could kill you with the amount of germs and bacteria outnumbering those on the toilet seat. Think hand sanitizer for stocking stuffers this year!!  There are hundreds more interesting and sometimes strange facts I didn't know but  the team of Goldberg and Leyner has now educated me to the level of expert.  I am not sure if that's something to be proud of or not but I laughed and laughed hard while reading \\"Why Do Men Have Nipples?\\" and I suggest it to anyone who might be tempted to accost a doctor outside of his office for answers to some of the more pressing  questions  you have about the human body.

If it was trying to be science fiction, it misses there too. I love a book I can get lost in,be part of ,be affected by. It didn't happen here. Just as I mentioned in my review of \\"The Saving Graces,\\" stories that jump from one perspective to another just serve to confuse things and almost deliberately keep you at a distance. I felt as if I was back in school, reading and flipping the pages back for clarification and then back again. That becomes a chore and ruins the experience for me.  Clare and Henry never developed into three dimensional characters, his age changing surely didn't help matters. The entire story fell flat less than halfway through and I completely lost all interest. . I just don't feel \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" lived up to its promising potential. I give Audrey Niffenegger credit for the premise and originality It really is one of a kind.  I just felt  it failed at delivery.	2005-08-03

Staying together for the children is one of the most damaging concepts of all times.  The author knows this and does present it in a way that eases my frustration a little bit.<br />I know many people who have divorced and not one was due to not being ecstatically happy all the time.  They fell apart due to abuse, infidelity, and just plain incompatibility.<br />What I feel matters most for children is for them to feel loved and cared for by their parents.  When you have two parents who both love and share in the lives of the kids, most hardly notice whether or not they live in the same house.<br />When you have a parent who refuses to makes the children a priority, who constantly disappoints, hurts, and replaces the kids, there will be damage, no getting away from it.  However, is it better for this type of parent to have daily access to the kids, seemingly with the other parent's approval?  I hardly think so and will challenge anyone who differs in opinion.<br />It is impossible for any of the children of divorce to know if their lives would have been better had their parents stayed married.  This is  a major flaw in  the research.  I didn't see any statistics for custody or parental involvement which makes a huge difference. I don't think divorce is the answer for every marital problem but when it happens, you have a responsibility to make your children a priority and alleviate their fears.  When you put your own personal interests ahead of the kid's, whether it's divorce or starting a new life afterward, kids will suffer.<br />I don't like 'studies' like this, they're misleading and potentially damaging.	2005-08-02

Elan Golomb's lack of objectivity is hard to take and everything comes across as pertaining to her, something a book on narcissism can do without.

Although I gave \\"Children of the Self Absorbed\\" high marks, I feel Nina Brown has made a grave error in writing this book.<br /><br />There is no way to a have a mutually satisfying relationship with a partner who has narcissistic personality disorder.  These \\"people\\" are void of empathy and are the center of their own universe.  You are nothing more than supply to  them, you are there to serve their egos.  If you take Brown's advise here and stop \\"feeding \\" them, they move on to a new victim.  They can not love anyone and will not love you.  I suppose if this is what you're looking for and you don't mind being an object, not a person, go for it.  I just can't imagine why anyone who knows the insidious nature of narcissism, would ever want to teach you how to have a relationship with  one.  Narcissists are abusers and you need to remove yourself from their grasp, not learn how to live within it.	2005-08-02

You can't change a narcissist but you can change how you react to them.  Nina Brown gives very useful and practical advise on dealing with the aftermath of having a narcissist for a parent and scars they leave on their children.  I especially like the lack of blame here, it is what it is and it's time to do something about it.  I don't think \\"Children of the Self-Absorbed\\" is only for adult children of narcissists, older teens can benefit greatly.  Nina brown has written a 'must have' survival guide that will teach them how to avoid the  pain that comes from expecting their parent to behave like others around them.  The narcissistic parent is the center of his own universe and as such, leaves no room for their children. Learning at an early age \\"this is not your fault\\" goes miles in achieving healing for what hurts the most, rejection.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Children of the Self-Absorbed.\\"	2005-08-02

This novel, a first for Khaled Hosseini,  was 'out of the box' for me and I am so glad I took the leap. It really is an unconventional love story, the very best kind.  Not all love stories need to be between a man and a woman in the traditional sense and this story certainly  proves that. I found it to be an extraordinarily powerful and intimate read.

This guy is not afraid to speak his mind and he writes with abandon.  What makes this book so funny is the presentation of the truth.  He just puts it out there and doesn't really care how it sounds or who's feeling might get hurt.  There is some material you might have heard elsewhere but I find it great to have it all at my fingertips.  I think this is a brilliant book that makes you laugh at some of the idiotic things we are exposed to every day. I really enjoyed it.<br />Some of the stuff I found the  funniest was his message to the oil companies, the baby changing station provided in men's bathrooms, and his view on cell phones.  I hate to admit liking the  very irreverent husband as a suspect in the wife's disappearance  but it's true and I did.

What I can say is this book has never been stored away or replaced since '87 and has been a staple in my kitchen from the beginning.  A true sign (for me) that a recipe book is a classic is its physical condition.  If the pages are crisp and clean, chances are it hasn't seen much use, probably for a good reason.  My copy of WSBB is worn and the pages have swelled from constant use. For close to 18 years, this has been the only book I have ever turned to for bread baking.  That has to say something.  Two of my all time favorite recipes are Beignets (page 229) and Classic Croissants (page 236.) Both take some time (overnight rising) but are simple and lead to professional results.  If you buy the book for these two alone, you have made an investment in culinary pleasure for a lifetime.  I am not exaggerating, they ARE that good.<br />I don't think there is a loaf of bread that has not been included in this collection. There are the traditional yeast loaves, international varieties, sweet breads and snacks.  Marilyn Moore has produced a classic encyclopedia you will refer to time after time.	2005-07-17

My three English Springer Spaniels love home-made bones and I have to admit, I loving making them.  I have  a few dog treat books and each have their own unique appeal.  This one is excellent for hard, crunchy biscuits.  The Peanut Butter Bones (page 24) are the guy's all time favorite.  I make them without the filling and have had to quadruple the recipe.  Not just for my dogs but for their friends too.  It has become a Saturday morning ritual they won't let me out of.  This book has seriously spoiled them.<br /><br />You can make your own \\"green breath freshening\\" type treats by adding  1/2 cup mint leaves to the \\"Spinach Bones\\" on page 35. Just lower the temperature to 200 and bake longer to retain the bright green color. I really like the heavy use of whole wheat flour since this makes a harder biscuit and is also so much healthier.  The best thing about \\"You Bake 'Em\\" is how it follows a basic formula that once mastered, lets you create your own combinations.  This was really a great gift!	2005-07-17

The way I see it, any book that can keep a 10 year old boy away from his video games, gets 5 stars and then some.  \\"Day of the Iguana\\" and the other eight books will do for boys what \\"The Babysitters Club\\" did for girls. I've been waiting a long time for something boys can relate to other than \\"Yu Gi Oh\\" comic books and \\"Captain Underpants.\\" Henry Winkler has done that with Hank Zipzer and his friends, he's made reading fun for boys.  You can count on Hank getting himself in a situation that would be best handled being straightforward and you can count on him going out of his way being anything but.  The best part is watching you kid choose Hank over the TV.  Parents all over will understand just what an accomplishment that is.	2005-07-17

I had never heard of it before and it didn't look all that interesting either.  I picked it up and was reading the last two chapters or so and then the tears started flowing.  I mean, this was a heavy  sob and I couldn't stop.  Thankfully, it got better at the very end and the waterworks stopped.  Not many children's books have such a powerful effect on me like this one has.  I think Stone Fox can teach children of all ages (this one isn't a kid anymore) ) the meaning of love and determination  like no other book can.  I recommend it highly.  It should be right up there on your list.	2005-07-17

It took me a while to get to this book because I thought it would be too time consuming and require more from me than I was willing to give.  I was wrong, dead wrong.  I actually found it to be a fast and furious read.  Once you start, be prepared to be pre-occupied with the characters and the story's progression until you read the very last word.  My 16 year old daughter read it at my insistence and has been recommending it to her friends every chance she gets.<br /><br />I have found a new favorite author and look forward to catching up on his previous works.  Dan Brown has a style that captures your imagination and brings you so deep within the pages, you end up feeling as though you were an active participant, not just a spectator.	2005-07-17

Albert Bernstein explains the various disorders that  fit so nicely under the title but narcissism is the number one in my book.  My favorite line in the book and the one that rings so true in my own life is \\"Have you ever noticed that people with big egos tend to be small everywhere else?\\"<br />The only way they can live up to their own self described greatness is to suck the very life out of you.  They feed off people, just like the legendary vampire but this is no fantasy.  They are real and the best way to protect yourself is to be armed  with knowledge.  Bernstein has written a decent portrayal and you will have valuable information at your fingertips.  What I don't like is the humorous slant the book gives.  There isn't anything funny about narcissists or other emotional vampires.	2005-07-17

Human beings have an enormous capacity to reach deep inside and access the powers within.  We just choose not to.  Whether it is a religious belief that makes us look outside of ourself for help or just conditioning, we have let this gift atrophy.  I always said the answer to so many of our problems is in the listening, not the doing or talking.  Just sit quietly and listen, the answers are all there if you're willing to allow them to surface.<br />DeBecker knows this and teaches you how to hone these skills. He will show you how to trust yourself, have faith in your own ability to know when a situation is terribly wrong.<br />How many of us suddenly see all the red flags at the end of a horrible relationship or situation?  Those red flags did not suddenly appear out of nowhere.  They were there from the beginning and were ignored or pushed aside either out of ignorance or the desire for the \\"appearance\\" of a situation.  The great guy, the independence, the can't miss business opportunity.  All of these  can shout decibels louder than your intuition ever could.  Intuition is quiet voice, it has to be actively listened too, it won't overpower any voice you choose to hear.  \\"The Gift of Fear\\" will help you listen to yourself, to hear what is inside you.<br />This is the best gift you can give your teenagers, help them learn this from the start. I might even go as far as to say no better graduation gift exists.  Okay, so put it on the seat of that new car or put the cash inside the pages instead of a card, but do give this as a gift to the ones you love.  It very well might save their lives.  At the very least, it will make their lives better by helping them to live it more aware and in control.	2005-07-17

The bond that holds these women together is enviable and their heartaches are things we all can relate to. What I didn't like at all is the format of the book.  Each chapter is written from each friend's point of view.  It bounces back and forth from Emma, Lee, Isabel, and Rudy, the only titles for all the chapters.  You'll be reading each event from a different point of view.  While this gives you insights into each character, it is extremely hard to follow and you end up not really knowing who is experiencing what.  I don't think it worked well and I found myself re-reading chapters past to see who was saying what and why.  There wasn't any flow at all.  It certainly wasn't a book that draws you in because you can't get far enough into without the feeling someone just switched the channel.	2005-04-12

Unfortunately, that's as good as it gets.  When the first lines  in the story are \\"My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name Susie.  I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973,\\" you assume it can only get better.  It doesn't.  The writing is good enough but not believable as coming from a fourteen-year old.  \\"The Lovely Bones\\" loses its credibility with sentences like \\"Other than that, they melted into the gender-subdivided world of their peers.\\" and \\"....\\"as Samuel took the daring step of kissing Lindsey in a room full of family, became borne aloft way from it.\\"<br /><br />If this was a story narrated by the parents or other middle-aged adult, it might have passed for a decent accounting of the family's trek through the hell of dealing with the pain of a murdered daughter.  Instead, it just misses the mark and leaves you feeling cheated somehow.  The one scene where Susie gets to live out a fantasy feels contrived and just doesn't fit in with the rest of the story.  The serial killer's demise is flat and the mother's way of dealing with the tragedy is just not plausible to me, especially the way she is treated after so many years, save her young son's honesty.<br /><br />This book is proof though, how hype and advertising can make a best seller even if there isn't any substantiation for it between the pages.	2005-03-12

That's where the uncontrollable and audible \\"sighs\\" come to the surface and it rises to terrific.  The book is made right there, with little Tala. She is actually the only one of the five people I feel really had anything to do with Eddie's purpose in life.  The others it seems are illuminating Eddie's mistakes or possibly explaining why  things happened the way they did. I found those a little empty.  Tala gives Eddie's life meaning and purpose and eventually, the peace he needs to move on.<br />I didn't find any life changing or affirming moments between the pages, but the author didn't promise any, did he? .<br />I only gave it 4 stars because I felt Mitch Albom made a big oversight with Eddie's funeral.  Considering the way he died, I felt it was a huge betrayal.<br /> \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" leaves you thinking about the events that shaped your own life and wondering if there is some meaning in them that escaped you.  It is a light read, I was done in a few short hours but little Tala is still lingering with me, days later.	2005-03-08

Thomas Hobbs has a vision that can be a little intimidating at first but that quickly passes when you realize you can re-create this beauty if you keep your mind open and away from the home improvement store's plant shop.  Quality gardens like these require quality plants that are rarely found outside of the small nurseries and catalogs.  Don't skimp if you want anything that resembles what you'll find between these pages.<br /><br />Both \\"Shocking Beauty\\" and Hobbs' \\"The Jewel Box Garden\\" are essential for any gardener.	2005-03-08

I was impressed with the depth of her knowledge of narcissism and the insidious and covert  nature of the disorder.<br />Emotional abuse is a double-edged sword because it is so hard to prove.  You'll go crazy just trying.  The abuser is careful to reveal himself only to his victim while showing his false self, the one that hooked you, to everyone else.  Manipulation is second nature to the emotional abuser, allowing him to slowly and methodically erode your sense of self and to murder your soul.  The latter being their goal.  You have become their prey, some'thing' to conquer.<br />I immensely appreciated and respected  Marie-France Hirigoyen careful avoidance and rejection of blaming the victim.  She shows in compassionate  detail how it is your very strengths and talents that make you perfect prey to a narcissist, not your weakness, as so many other books on the subject will have you believe. Blaming the victim is just another layer of abuse and this author discredits that theory with a few strokes of her mighty pen. She appears to have an  intimate understanding of the inner workings of a mental abuser and her knowledge flows freely from the pages directly to you. Where it is the abuser's goal to destabilize, Marie-France Hirigoyen is the friend who lovingly shakes your shoulders and shouts \\"It's not YOU,\\" leading you back to sanity.<br />As a reminder, this book was originally written in French and the small translation difficulties should not deter you in any way.	2005-03-07

Nicholas Sparks did a wonderful job describing what real love is and what \\"till death do us part\\" really means in a marriage.  So many love stories just focus on lust and passion so one can get the impression this is the goal in a relationship.  While \\"The Notebook\\" has this, it delves deeper to reveal that love is what is left when the passion eventually fades and the author shows this in the most tender and loving way.<br /><br />This might be the best book you can give your daughter before she starts dating, something that can show love's full range and not just the fantasy so many people attach themselves to.	2005-03-07

Once you fully grasp the fact that a narcissist is an abuser, why would you do anything but run for the hills?  Would you look for ways to manage a physically abusive relationship?  Maybe you'll remember to have little baggies of ice available for when the creep punches you in the eye?  An emotional abuser is as bad or from my perspective, worse than a physical abuser.  Narcissists are insidious and covert with their abuse and somehow make you think and feel it's all your fault.  Their life's mission is to steal all that is good about you, to steal your very soul.  Why in hell would this be a person we would attempt to manage?<br /><br />I have a feeling Sandy Hotchkiss is referring to narcissistic tendencies or possibly narcissistic behaviors but heaven forbid she is really talking about Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Her description of the \\"Seven Deadly Sins of Narcissism\\" is missing the number one, granddaddy of all time, \\"Lack of Empathy.\\" It's this missing link that allows a narcissist to treat humans as if their lives are meaningless.  To me, this is the core of NPD.<br />I know there is a tremendous difference between a person who studies narcissism as an outsider, one who has an objective view of the facts and figures of it all, and a person who has experienced the relationship from hell.  It is only the person who has been there and hopefully survived who can tell you this book is not going to get you where you need to go.<br />If any book suggests a relationship with a narcissist, especially an intimate one, can be handled, managed, or otherwise placed under your control, put it down, pass \\"go\\" and run like hell.	2005-03-06

Finding a shady spot for midday gardening is great advice if you have a shade garden, otherwise, you're gardening wherever your plants happen to be.  This trivial  information really grated on my nerves and is what earned it just two stars.<br /><br /> The lack of pictures is a big disadvantage especially when the author decides to use common as opposed to botanical names.<br /><br />I find Home Depot even uses different names from week to week on certain plants and it's impossible to determine just what is being talked about without a botanical reference.<br /><br />The calendar was a little disappointing as that was the main reason for buying this book.<br /><br />I can find something useful in any gardening book so it does have some value, it's just not what I was looking for.	2005-03-06

One where you knew what you were going through  wasn't normal but you were being told constantly it was.  Did you ever have a partner who is incapable of showing real emotion unless of course, it's about him?  What about the end of a relationship?  Were you ever just \\"unplugged\\" so that he could \\"plug\\" the new one right into your slot as if you never existed?<br /><br />Do you find yourself slowly disappearing, your interests and talents pushed aside in favor of trying to meet his needs?  Do your successes bring out the worst in him?<br /><br />Dr. Vaknin gives an in-depth look into the mind of a narcissist.  It doesn't matter that it's his own mind he is opening up for viewing.  He makes it painfully clear how much alike all narcissists are though they live their lives thinking they're unique. Through the pages of \\"Malignant Self Love,\\" you will come to know your narcissist intimately, in a way he would never allow on his own. You'll learn why he's the way he is but what is most important, you'll learn why he won't ever change.  You'll learn that he recreates reality so that talking to him, seeking closure becomes impossible.  You never existed so what is there to talk about?  You could have been together two years or 20 and it doesn't make a difference to this personality disordered, soul-less creature.<br /><br />The most terrifying thing to learn is how completely normal they look and act, at first.  It's easy to fall into their trap and getting out is nearly impossible.<br /><br />A narcissist can't love but he's a great actor. He knows how to suck you in, to pretend to be everything you were looking for.  Once he has you, watch out because that's the end of your ride.<br /><br />He is capable of devaluing and discarding you without ever looking back.  A narcissist looks at his ex the way you would look at an old pair of sneakers...totally used up and ready for the trash.<br /><br />It can be hurtful to know how he talks about you to others, calls you names and labels you in the most horrible way until you read Dr. Vaknin's work.  There you will learn how almost every narcissist does the same thing as if they had a manual to go by. You find a slight sense of peace to see how 'every' narcissist's ex is crazy, psycho, a lunatic in their eyes.

The authors have creatively described each recipe in tail wagging ways that are sure to please.  My three Springer Spaniels quickly devour everything I make and I love knowing I'm giving them fresh, wholesome food. I would suggest you refrigerate all the treats you make if you live in a warm climate.  Unlike the boxed treats you buy in the store, these don't have a shelf live longer than your dog's.	2005-03-05
US	49056735	R2SFCS8KVAR8UR	0881926469	641659032	Jewel Box Garden	Books	5	23	27	N	N	Absolute Perfection	A more appropriate name doesn't exist.  Imagine opening a beautifully crafted jewelry box to find the most sparkling baubles and brightly colored gems.  David McDonald's photographs create this effect with the most  exquisite flowers and plants imaginable.  Nature's beauty surpasses the traditional sparkling trinkets one might expect to find and Thomas Hobbs describes them in the manner they deserve.  I found this book to be a work of art, a gallery of paintings that happened to be growing from the earth. A must have for every gardener, artist, or anyone who appreciates beauty.	2005-03-05

What more would any kid want or need in a story?  DiCamillo has a way of getting inside a child's mind with her writing and does so magically. This was a book I just had to read out loud to my son as it lends itself to many voices and fun expressions.  My older daughter came in to see what was going on and returned every night to hear the rest.<br /><br />A soon to be classic that truly earned the Newberry Medal.	2005-03-05

The Automat was the best part of our trips to Manhattan, even beating out the Museum of Natural History. I don't remember the food at all but putting those coins in the slots and picking up my prize will be forever etched in my mind.  My main problem with the content is how it is organized.  I found it choppy and at times hard to follow.  The text can go from the 40s to the 60s and back to the 30s all on one page.<br /><br />It appears to be a compilation of notes and facts without much order or flow.  Buy it for the memories and you'll get what you pay for.  If you're looking for more, you'll be as disappointed as you'd be if you tried to get a nickle lunch today.	2005-03-05

Lots of help and ideas to create an intimate courtyard garden.  There are plenty of photos to  get your imagination going.<br />I like that most of the gardens can be adapted to my sub-tropic zone, nothing is cut in stone, except the pathways.	2005-03-05

I was under the impression this was a journal written by the great-grandaughter of the founder and would give some insight of the day.  I was wrong.<br />As a blank diary, it's vintage style is appealing and it's just the right size to carry with you if you're so inclined.  If you're expecting to reminisce about the Automat, buy the book I mentioned above.	2005-02-08
