The DVD alone is already worth the money.  Donna is an excellent teacher and all the demos are very interesting and practical, both for personal use and for groups.  Not only is the quality of production good.  You are also given revisions and summaries and you can select different exercises instead of watching the whole DVD as a movie.<br /><br />The nice set of cards, including drawings and succinct steps are a great help for revision and for the learning of additional exercises.<br /><br />The audio CD will guide you through different personal daily routine practices.  There is also a nicely produced booklet with sketches of meridian points.  Even a plastic crystal is included.<br /><br />For those who are only familiar with \\"talking cure\\", this is a great introduction to Energy Medicine and Energy Psychology. You get exposure to muscle testing, energy balancing, ways to reduce stress, a vivid understanding of how we are energy systems... Others who have background in Energy Psychology and Brain Gym, can still find the whole kit a very useful teaching tool and a handy guide for personal practice.	2005-09-05

I was thrilled to watch Lipton's \\"The New Biology\\" videotape a few years ago and even more impressed to hear him in person with slides, animations and movie clips last January.  Short of such opportunities, the book with many pictures and diagrams, will be a good introduction.  It is rare to find a highly qualified research scientist being able to present his ideas in such a simple, personal, lively and engaging way.<br /><br />The book is much more systematic than the documentary \\"What the Bleep Do We Know?\\".  Both open up new horizons and will stir up much debate.<br /><br /> We are not just determined by our genes.  Our environment, thinking and beliefs all play an important part in the creation of our own destinies.  It is a message of hope and challenge.  Such a world-view has tremendous implications for spirituality, healing, education, parenting and the building of a more loving and peaceful world community.	2005-06-29

This more up-to-date book is the best introduction to people who want to know the history, the researches and the why of the Noni success and its safe use.  Dr. Solomon is a leading authority in the field and has highly reputed medical standing.<br />The book reports survey data from over 25,000 Noni juice drinkers, collected from 1,227 doctors and health professionals.  Dr. Solomon summarised the results under 29 conditions.  Those suffering from: allergy, arthritis, asthma, cancer, fibromyalgia, depression, diabetes, 1 & 2, digestions, energy increased, heart disease, high BP, immune system, kidney disease, menstruation, mental alertness, muscle, obesity, pain, including headaches, respiratory problems, skin and hair problems, sexual enhancement, sleep, stress, well-being -- all reported improvement from 67% to 90%.  56%/876 stopped smoking.  53%/1806 has improvement in stroke, 55%/155 in HIV, 52%/25 in Multiple Sclerosis, and 52%/25 in Parkinson's Disease.<br />Section II: Noni and Disease from A to Z, gives very clear explanations on why Noni helps.  One gains a good background of basic medical knowledge in relation to the above conditions.<br />I know personally a medical doctor who suffered from liver cancer over ten years ago in Hawaii and is doing very well now.  He is a great believer in Noni and does his own research.  I myself have leucoplakia, white patches of growth, on my vocal cords for well over a year.  Initially Chinese medicine helped to some extent.  After I stopped having that not seeing further improvement, I tried Noni and it has been a great help.  A scheduled operation is no longer required.<br />Do read the book if you are interested in alternative health for yourself or others.	2005-06-28

Lowney teased out four strands or principles of leadership  (self-awareness, ingenuity, love and heroism) from the heritage of St. Ignatius Loyola and has woven a very impressive tapestry based on the history and lives of outstanding Jesuits. The book is not just for organizational leaders and managers, but suitable for anyone who wants to lead a better and more fruitful life. I wish to thank all the previous reviewers for their excellent comments and summaries.<br />Having been a Jesuit for well over 40 years, I've found the book a timely wake-up call.<br />I have known personally and indirectly so many outstanding Jesuits who have continued the tradition. Yet there is also room for reflection. In contrast to the early boom and the revival after the Suppression of Jesuits (1750-1773), the Society of Jesus has been declining in numbers very steadily from the peak in the early 60s of 36000+ to just below 20,000 last year. Although the decrease in vocations to the religious life is a fairly universal phenomenon, except in some developing countries, it is still worthwhile for the Church, Christian organisations and Jesuits in particular, to look in the mirror of this book.<br />Are we are too set in our patterns or have we got off track at times, lacking in 1) self-awareness, 2) innovation, 3) love, and 4) the passionate and heroic desire for the greater glory of God (In Latin, Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam, Ignatius' motto).  (Excuse a digression.  St. Iranaeus, whose feast is today, said that the glory of God is the human person fully alive and being alive is the vision of God.  One may think of \\"To love one another is to see the face of God.\\" from the musical, Les Miserables,seemingly based on St. John.)<br />The value of The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius has been much stressed. But sometimes the transforming effect seems to be still limited and not lasting. Are people just going through the formality and the stipulated hours of prayer without ongoing personal appropriations of the \\"death and resurrection\\", or \\"call, exile and return\\" that are manifested in so many of the life-stories in the book, or in \\"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"Star Wars\\"?<br />\\"Finding God in all things\\", and being \\"contemplatives in action\\" are the hallmarks of Jesuit spirituality. But do we not often just get too involved in action without deep contemplation? How self-aware are we? Are we just being driven along, even in lofty aspirations and zealous busyness, by our own compulsions to save ourselves, as depicted by the Enneagram types? How receptive to grace are we?<br />From Dec. 3rd this year, there will be the Jubilee Year for the 450th anniversary of the death of St. Ignatius and 500th anniversary of the birth of St. Francis Xavier and St. Peter Faber. May this book continue to inspire and to awaken Jesuits in their life-long renewal and also share the perennial spirit and wisdom of these three giants and the Jesuit legacy with the whole of humankind.ed hours of prayer without ongoing personal appropriations of the \\"death and resurrection\\", or \\"call, exile and return\\" that are manifested in so many of the life-stories in the book, or in \\"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"Star Wars\\"?   \\"Finding God in all things\\", and being \\"contemplatives in action\\" are the hallmarks of Jesuit spirituality.

A revised and enlarged edition of this classic (1995) has just been published. Carla is always at the cutting-edge.  Her insights have been confirmed by advances in neuro-sciences and all of the first edition are still valid.  But it is good to have some additional new input from the past 10 years. I'll first select a few quotes as appetizer.<br /> Candace Pert, from Georgetown University, in her Introduction, admits that Carla \\"has also highlighted new research and insights which go beyond my 1999 book Molecules of Emotion... Learning is naturally a pleasurable experience and Carla Hannaford shows us how to return to that state as she explores the research, and ways and means of achieving the optimal learning environment.\\"<br /> Carla in concluding her Preface: \\"It has been a wonderful experience to bring forward so much new research, which strongly supports our need as human beings to connect, love, laugh, play and share music with each other to make each moment the best learning experience possible.  I invite and challenge you to partake of the new findings of science, and to explore simple ways to optimize our experience and that of our children, to live more complete, passionate, creative, satisfying lives.\\"<br />An important up-date is the heart-brain connection, more elaborated in her excellent book: Awakening the Child Heart: Handbook for Global Parenting. Other short, but significant up-date reports are interspersed throughout the book.<br />There are more expansions in Chapters 11: The Vestibular System, and 12: Fight and Flight--The Stress Effect on Learning.<br />Additional paragraphs on oxytocin and dopamine in relation to learning have been included.  Those who don't mind being distracted by more neuro-chemistry, may find Why We Love and The Edge Effect also interesting.<br /> There are some changes and additional diagrams and photos. I'm glad that Carla's own artistic sketchings are all kept.<br />This book is a \\"must\\" for every parent and educator.	2005-06-28

Instead of ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) and ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), it follows Diagnostic and Statistics Manual IV's revised terms, AD/HD. It is a \\"New View\\". In 71 pages, Jensen and team (Karen Markowitz, Michael Dabney, Karen Selsor and Jennifer Decker Arevalo--regular contributors to The Learning Brain Newsletter) have packed an up-to-date, research-based, succinct, informative, and practical coverage of the topic. (Of course there is no scope for in-depth treatment like Daniel G. Amen's Healing ADD, dealing with 6 different types.)  The book helps parents, teachers, doctors and professional helpers to adopt a much more humane approach with the new understanding.<br /><br />AD/HD is not a disease. \\"AD/HD is a constellation of context-dependent behaviors most disruptive in restricted environments. But in the right environment, it is no more a disability than being blind in the dark or being dyslexic on the soccer field.\\" (Insisde cover page) It can even be considered a gift in right contexts. There is no single known cause.<br /><br /> \\"AD/HD is diagnosed in 7%-17% of children in the United States and accounts for half of all visits to child psychiatric clinics.\\" (p.21, quote from Barbaresi) It is important to seek professional diagnosis and define the severity of the conditions. Brain scans may become a better diagnostic tool.<br />Throughout the book, the emphasis is on accommodation rather than rampant medication without the know-how and support for positive behavioral change. (For severe conditions, a non-stimulant medication called Atomoxetine, which reduces inattention and impulsivity, is on the horizon.)<br />Numerous tips, suggestions, solutions, strategies and checklists for school preparedness and teacher success are provided for parents and teachers. For further studies, and possible co-existing  or confusing conditions, I recommend Jensen's Different Brains, Different Learners, or you can just follow the website-links given in the book.

For those who haven't personally met these two wonderful persons, it will help to take a good look at their photos first and feel their loving and intimate company as you read the book, written with the &quot;child heart&quot;.<br /><br />The &quot;Child Heart&quot; is a symbol of coherent universal connection.  After a decade of the brain, Carla advocates &quot;The Decade of the Child Heart&quot;, envisioning &quot;the possibilities of a world of people who truly loved and empowered children, themselves and other adults.  Our emphasis might be on community coherence and cooperation rather than commerce, competition and warfare.&quot; (p.159)<br /><br />Coherence is &quot;a conscious state of being in alignment with our purpose, joy, happiness and connection to others.&quot; (p.2)  This is a key concept throughout the book.  The Heartmath Institute found that the heart rate variability becomes coherent with feelings of appreciation, love, joy, and incoherent with frustration and stress.  Such patterns affect the brain functions.<br /><br />So many useful and fascinating insights, gleaned from extensive scientific studies are clearly summarized and explained in this book of under 200 pages, illustrated by over 30 figures.  One gains enlightened understanding of: stress, depression, stress in utero, the heart as emotion generator, a new world-view of vibrational patterns, the key roles of sound, music, movement and play... Carla is an excellent guide.  It is better than reading dozens of such books and not grasping the essentials and interconnections.<br /><br />  Just to quote one example on &quot;The Sound of Dyslexia&quot;.  &quot;Many researchers now believe that dyslexia begins in utero with maternal stress that affects the semicircular canals.  The resulting underdeveloped vestibular system affects the ability to hear...&quot; The inadequate development of hearing &quot;can end up with behavioral patterns that we label as Dyslexia, ADHD, Learning Disabled and even Emotionally Handicapped&quot; (pp.110-111)<br /><br />  There are also many nourishing and thought-provoking quotes throughout the book.<br />E.g. &quot;Everything happens as if human behavior were largely conditioned by the manner in which one hears.&quot; -Guy Berard, M.D. (p.110)  &quot;Laughter is the quintessential human social signal.

I wish all teachers and teachers-to-be can benefit from it.  For busy teachers who don't have the luxury to read up on so many diverse sources, you get a good distillation of their applications.<br /><br />&quot;Don't smile until Christmas!&quot; is the conventional wisdom.  Martha's first suggestion is to SMILE.  Chapter 1, &quot;From Fear to Flow&quot; highlights the importance of safe environment and &quot;relaxed alertness&quot; for learning and quotes the eight components of FLOW.<br /><br />Many &quot;good ideas&quot; marked by the icon of a light bulb, sensible quotes and summaries, questions that challenge our assumptions are given throughout the book.<br /><br />Each chapter starts with a cartoon and a brief summary of &quot;Begin with the Brain&quot; principle.  E.g. Ch. 3 on &quot;Patterns and Procedures: Organizing Systems for Orderliness&quot; begins with the following statements.  &quot;The brain innately seeks to detect familiar and useful patterns in its environment.  These patterns give a context to what otherwise might be interpreted as meaningless.  These meaningful patterns, when practiced, become wired in the brain as programs.&quot;  Then the author goes on to make applications, refining distinctions such as setting standards rather than imposing rules, the need for procedures and routines rather than discipline... and provides tools for teachers.<br /><br /> Martha does not cover the anatomy and fucntions of the brain. But we get both good brain-compatible, democratic, student-centred principles and support for developing relevant skills without getting into polemics.  I trust teachers will appreciate the challenge to one's thinking and practice and all the help given here.  When well assimilated, we are all taught not only good principles and practices for teaching and learning, but also for living.	2002-02-22

Aside from Chapter 3 on understanding learning difficulties and intervening, all the other chapters are applicable to all students.  Just look through the chapter headings: making all students welcome in your classroom, getting everyone involved in learning, matching your teaching to your students' learning styles...  This is a very practical and valuable book for teachers.  It has fairly comprehensive coverage, including 8 multiple intelligences, the teaching of reading, writing and math, authentic assessment, improving behavior, conflict resolution, enlisting parents as partners...  There are many case examples, numerous techniques for each topic.  Take spelling as an example (p111-115).  Students are taught to match spelling with their learning styles: visual, auditory, tactile-kinesthetic and multisensory.  There are 5 or 6 more techniques for spelling.

Let me quote extensively:<br />&quot;More than 95 percent of your organization's problems derive from your systems, processes, and methods, not from your individual workers....<br /><br />We look to the heroic efforts of outstanding individuals for our successful work. Instead we must create systems that routinely allow excellent work to result from the ordinary efforts of ordinary people.<br /><br />Changing the system will change what people do. Changing what people do will not change the system.<br /><br /> Certain common management approaches--management by objectives, performance appraisal, merit pay, pay for performance, and ISO 9000--represent not leadership but the abdication of leadership.<br /><br />Current buzzwords like empowerment, accountability, and high performance are meaningless, empty babble...&quot; (ix-x)<br /><br />The old organizations's leaders need: forcefulness, ability to motivate and inspire, decisiveness, willfulness, assertiveness, result- and bottom-line orientation, being task-oriented and having integrity and diplomacy.<br /><br />Scholtes' new leadership competencies (much influenced by Edward Deming's ideas...) are based on a new mentality and understanding of: systems thinking, variability of work, how we learn, psychology and human behavior, interactions of these components, and vision, meaning, direction and focus.<br /><br />The bulk of the book gives clear elaborations of these new competencies, with charts, illustrations, pertinent questions and many tools. Ch. 4 on &quot;Getting the Daily Work Done&quot; is a tough one, partly because it takes much effort to grasp the author's use of a Japanese term, &quot;Gemba&quot; (even when I can read the original Chinese characters). Issues of waste, standardization, change versus improvement, performance without appraisal, use of measurement data... are all seen in the new light of systems thinking.<br />Carefully study the differences between &quot;Crazymakers&quot; and &quot;Healing and Learning&quot; in the workplace (pp378-387). There is a summary of the book under &quot;The 47 Habits of Pretty Good Leaders&quot; (pp391-6). Peter Senge's books give excellent background material.

A. Understanding and Managing Emotional States (Triune brain, anchoring, reframing, positive intentionality, accessing resource states)--focus of Chs.3 &amp; 4.  B. Effective Communication and Intervention Skills (reflective listening, overcoming reactive responses, sensory acuity, effective non-verbal communication, assertion and apology)--Chs. 5-8.  C. Developing an Internal Coach (learning from experience, clarity of outcomes, visioning, problem-solving, efficacy)--Chs. 9-11.<br /><br /> Although there isn't a single reference to NLP (Neuro-linguistic Programming), its influence is obvious. The model of the Triune brain is used as a metaphor for organizing different levels of behavior. Throughout the book you get different kinds of framed boxes of definitions, icons, summaries, quotes and interesting bits of information. Sometimes they become distracting while you are reading the main text.<br /><br />This is not an original work that I'd enthusiastically recommend to teachers. It is better to read Gottman's books that the author also seems to appreciate. However, if you have this book in the library, you can get some practical and useful ideas from it for developing emotional literacy.	2001-09-12

At the beginning of each chapter of this book, there is a pie-chart of key ideas. Just flip through these 14 charts, the summaries, and &quot;Guiding Assumptions&quot; on p. 33, you get a good over-view.<br /><br />This book contains much more than Lozanov's Suggestopedia, which is mentioned specifically in Chapter 2, with 3 other approaches. In fact, this is an excellent book on general brain-compatible principles that are applicable to all teaching and learning. Topics include: paying attention to the environment, use of materials, music, good relationship and facilitation skills, maximizing first impressions, lesson planning, active learning... There is much clear and useful material for creating joyful and meaningful learning. Teachers are even taught to use suggestions and metaphors, along the tradition of Milton Erickson.<br /><br />I like the quote from Jensen: &quot;...humans are designed to learn complex languages effortlessly. The reality is, therefore, that language fluency ought to be a joyful process.&quot; Also what Dhority says in the Preface: &quot;who we are&quot; - the beliefs and attitudes with which we identify - is inextricably intertwined with how we teach.<br /><br />Readers would appreciate details, such as &quot;The optimal time for learning a second language is from age five to ten years.&quot; (p. 5) &quot;...crescent seating patterns are far more preferable to conventional rows.&quot; (p. 85)... The discussion on the place of grammar, homework and error correction in the last chapter is timely and helpful.	2001-09-12

This &quot;Crisp Fifty-Minute Book&quot; covers five emotional intelligence skills: self-awareness skills, social skills, optimism, emotional control, and flexibility skills. Part 1 on &quot;Think Smart&quot; strategies covers self-awareness and optimistic thinking. Part 2 on &quot;Be Smart&quot; strategies covers social skills, emotional control and flexibility. These 5 skills are applied to organizations in Part 3 on &quot;Work Smart&quot; strategies.<br /><br />Many simple self-assessment tools are given. They are actually more specific behavioral descriptions of these 5 skills.<br />There is a STEP model, classifying people as Stable, Thorough, Emotional or Pusher with each type's strengths and weaknesses, motivations, and communication strategies in dealing with each.<br /><br />Emotional intelligence is talked about a lot. It helps to get a better understanding of that through more detailed behavioral descriptions and exercises for self-awareness and change, even if they are over-simplified.	2001-09-11

As it is commonly known, the best way to learn is to teach. Rentention is supposed to reach 95% (William Glasser). So this book only gives a basic description of the brain and then adapts Jensen's ten principles for teaching and learning. These are: uniqueness, assessment, emotions, meaning, multi-path, brain-body, memory, nutrition, cycles and rhythms, and elimination of threat. We are not only given an explanation, but also provided with lesson plans and diverse activities to teach such principles. Black line masters are included for reproduction for class use. Everything is guided by the relevance check: WIIFM (What's In It For Me?) and SWYAK (Show What You Already Know). If only all teachers could work through such a teaching program, both teachers and students would have such brain-based principles built into them as a way of life. We will all grow in self-esteem competence, multiple intelligences, emotional intelligence, health, purpose and overall well-being.	2001-09-11

The author has certainly done extensive reading in the field.  Chapter 1 gives useful summaries of: the physiology and functioning of the brain, issues of nature vs. nurture, brain and mind, emotions, theories of the intellect, memory and learning.  Chapter 2 defines the brain-compatible classrooms in terms of the Four-Corner Framework of teaching: for, of, with and about thinking.  There are numerous charts, tabulations, graphic organizers, lists of skills and behaviors...  Short of attending prolonged workshops, I'm afraid it is just impossible for most teachers to grasp the author's framework of mind and make sensible and good use of the material.	2001-09-11

Here it is applied to identifying 10 types of different learners: 1. impulsive ones with ADD, 2. resigned with learned helplessness, 3. challenged reader with dyslexia, 4. argumentative with oppositional disorder, 5. frustrated with learning delayed, 6. hyperactive, 7. with auditory-processing deficits, 8. out of control, 9. the demotivated with chronic threat and distress, and 10. depressed and troubled.<br />You are given a pre-test and a post-test of 10 unique students to see if you can identify the patterns of symptoms rather than isolated behaviors. There are many color-prints of corresponding brain-images and graphic charts that facilitate learning. Brief summaries of treatment methods, supplementary resources on books, websites and organizations are given on each type. All teachers should acquire such general background knowledge so that the unqiue needs and gifts of students can be respected.	2001-09-10

The book covers a similar format in 10 areas: cognition, environments, achievement and test performance, music/arts, memory, mind/body, nutrition, enrichment, early years, and the fragile brain.  Each article gives a succinct summary of the issues based on research data, &quot;Action Steps&quot; and sources.  There are just too many interesting and relevant topics.  A few examples: &quot;Is Chocolate Good for Learning?&quot;, &quot;The 'Mozart Effect' Under Fire: Where Do We Go From Here?&quot;, &quot;Why Some Learners Strive on Stress?&quot;, &quot;Learning a New Language in Early Childhood Requires Less Brain Effort&quot;, &quot;Neuroplasticity: How Do We Change Our Brain?', &quot;The Biology of Cheating&quot;...  There are many passages that you wish to quote and teach the students.  Teachers and school administrators can also make better decisions based on reliable information supplied by the book.<br /><br />Compared to Jensen's other books with even more illustrations, I hope this book could be improved in the next edition.  E.g., can you make sense of the following?  &quot;Research suggests that fonts with serifs (referring to the short lines stemming at an angle from the upper and lower ends of the stroke of a letter) increase reading speed rates when compared to sans serif fonts (without seifs).&quot; (p. 10)  A sketch of the anatomy of the brain would help for visualising many terms throughout the book. E.g. in &quot;Gender Differences and Learning Performance&quot;, unless you have some background already, it would be hard to know what is being compared (pp. 69-71).  Of course you can start with other introductory books first.  Overall, this is a very valuable and interesting book for all educators.	2001-09-10

Charts, comparison tables, drawings, framed key ideas and activities, headings... all help to make the book easy to read, understand and use. After contrasting &quot;Industrial-Age&quot; with &quot;Information-Age&quot; beliefs and education, a very basic anatomy and physiology of the brain is given.<br /><br />To be brain-compatible, teachers must consider these findings from brain research: &quot;Emotions are critical to succesful learning. Our brains are poorly designed for rote learning. Multisensory input is desired by our brains. Learning involves the whole body. Threat, high anxiety, and a sense of helplessness can impair learning. Our brains are 'plastic' and can continue to develop throughout our lives...&quot; (p.35)<br /><br />Elaborate rehearsal through multiple opportunities (role playing, creative writing, cooperative learning tasks, multisensory experiences) helps the formation of long-term memory. &quot;Think-Pair-Share&quot; and &quot;10-2&quot; (10 mins.' sharing followed by 2 mins.' student processing) are strategies that help assimilation. (p.41)<br /><br />Mental models or beliefs with regard to students, teaching, intelligence, power and control directly affect our teaching styles and student learning. Tools, strategies and surveys are given for collaborative learning, community building in the classroom, conflict resolutions, inquiry, integrated instruction, and brain-compatible assessment, which both measures achievement and provides motivation.<br /><br />This is a simple introductory book making good use of secondary sources. Once convinced of its value, readers can explore the website links and other books in the bibliography, which should be updated already with many new relevant titles and some new editions of the books listed.	2001-09-01

Its comprehensive coverage gives much background, even at the risk of being distracting when you want to follow-up on the leads to so many interesting source-books and links.  Though you are told to dip in anywhere, you must read the first section, esp. &quot;The Industrial Age System of Education&quot; by Senge and &quot;A Primer to the Five Disciplines&quot; (Personal Mastery, Mental Models, Shared Vision, Team Learning and Systems Thinking) (pp. 27-93).<br /><br />The authors consider this book a &quot;prequel&quot; to their other books about learning organizations (p.7).  That's true.  Though this is the most recent book, you can start with this one and go on to the others for further depth.  Some repetitions may only serve well for mastery.<br /><br />The whole book is very readable and informative.  Concepts are clearly explained.  It follows the same excellent editing format as The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook and The Dance of Change.<br /><br />When you get too enthused by so many ideas and success stories of innovations, heed the advice for &quot;The Strategy of Organizational Change&quot;.  &quot;Focus on one or two new priorities for change, not twelve.  Most school systems are already overwhelmed with change.  They don't need a new initiative; they need an approach that consolidates existing initiatives, eliminates &quot;turf battles,&quot; and makes it easier for people to work together toward common ends.&quot; (p.25)<br /><br />There are just too many passages that you wish to quote.  The book is a treasure mine.  However, for those (esp. busy administrators) who find the volume too daunting or verbose (592 pages!) and still want to get a handle on launching into transforming their schools into learning organisations, I would recommend, &quot;Ten Steps to a Learning Organization&quot; and start with the simple questionnaire given there.	2001-08-31

We need to cultivate leadership at all levels of any organization, business or education, &quot;to face problems for which there are no simple, painless solutions&quot; (p.3). Instead of prescribing recipes of set steps for leaders, Fullan gives a framework or new mind-set of 5 themes or capacities. Figure 1.1 (p.4) gives a clear image of the non-linear interacting components: the inner pie of moral purpose (acting with the intention of making a positive difference), understanding change, relationship building, knowledge creation and sharing, and coherence making. It is surrounded by an outer rim of the personal characteristics of leaders: &quot;energy-enthusiasm-hopefulness&quot;. Effective leaders thus mobilize commitment, both external (based on management policies) and internal (getting a job done is intrinsically rewarding). The aim or outcome of leadership is to make sure that &quot;more good things happen&quot; and &quot;fewer bad things happen&quot; defined according to different contexts.<br /> Fullan gives many case studies and quotes interesting and relevant sources. For example, it is very helpful to learn and use the different leadership styles identified by Goleman in response to different needs (pp. 35ff). The 6 styles are: 1. Coercive (&quot;Do what I tell you.&quot;). 2. Authoritative (&quot;Come with me.&quot;). 3. Affiliative (&quot;People come first.&quot;). 4. Democratic (&quot;What do you thin?&quot;). 5. Pacesetting (&quot;Do as I do, now.&quot;). 6. Coaching (&quot;Try this&quot;).<br /> While stressing the importance of relationships, the author also cautions us that close relationships are not ends in themselves. Bad practices can often be reinforced by the community (p.67). In talking about leading change, Fullan reminds us to be tortoise-like and quotes Claxton's &quot;slow knowing&quot; (pp.122-3).<br />I have read this slim book several times and have found it very worthwhile and enlightening.s slim book several times and have found it very worthwhile and enlightening.	2001-08-29

It belongs to the publisher's new series of &quot;First Directions - an inspirational source of information, insights and practical techniques to change your life&quot;.  It is printed on quality paper with many colorful and scenic pictures unrelated to the content. The actual text does include many key NLP concepts clearly explained.  Rather dry and not that inspirational.  Joseph's story of his own everyday trance is touching (p. 76).

I feel privileged to pick this book to mark my 100th review for Amazon.com.  I've been recommending to numerous groups Gottman and co-authors' books, esp. the  less technical ones: The Heart of Parenting (which is in Chinese also), Why Marriages Succeed or Fail and The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work.<br />With almost 3 decades of research of actual interactions, Gottman and teams' books are always filled with vivid and enlightening examples.  The touching personal stories, elucidating questionnaires, exercises and long lists of &quot;what to do&quot; are all helpful and practical.  They hold up multi-dimensioanl mirrors to explorations.  Without having to do any formal meditation, you can grow in awareness and mindfulness.<br />Given the plethora of popularization, it might sound trite to relate this book to E.Q. (Emotional Intelligence).  But it IS one of the best books for developing mindful emotional connections.  That's why I need to qualify it with &quot;authentic E.Q.&quot;.  Please note in particular &quot;Emotional Intelligence Versus Detachment and Denial&quot; (pp. 158-160).<br />Please read the informative Book Description and the review by Mitchell (one of my &quot;favorite people&quot;).  In Step One, breaking down communication to the basic unit of exchange, &quot;bidding&quot;, and responding (turning toward, away or against), helps one to learn HOW to behave differently instead of remaining at lofty levels of unfruitful talk about love and consideration... (This reminds one of Eric Berne's &quot;stroking&quot; in Transactional Analysis, most popular in the 60s &amp; '70s.  &quot;Stroking&quot; however, connotes more manipulation.)<br />The authors have done a good service to make Jaak Panksepp's pioneering studies in Affective Neuroscience accessible to readers in Step Two: Discover Your Brain's Emotional Command Systems.  (It would be interesting to see if there are any correlations with the Enneagram systems, which study nine-types of personality.)<br />Step Three: Examine Emotional Heritage, gives a good illustration of the value of the &quot;emotion-coaching philosophy&quot;.

He adopts a conversational approach and prescribes many exercises as handouts.  Readers must follow the book as if you are one of the participants and must be willing to do the exercises (many with the need of one or two partners) to really benefit from the book.<br /> I wonder how many will be able to follow the exercises and seriously do them.  It is also rather contrived to have the characters as if you were in a workshop.  You are not.  There is quite extensive coverage or collection of  NLP (Neuro-linguistic Programming) and related material, including Fractal Language Model by John McWhirter, who wrote the Foreword.  But the book falls between the stools of a real introduction to NLP and a proper manual for a workshop.<br />Those giving workshops, esp. in NLP, can probably pick up some useful exercises, though most of them are borrowed.  It is ironic that a book titled &quot;Communication Excellence&quot;  fails to help the readers to achieve much real understanding.

Although they use mostly secondary sources, they have provided a great service to school administrators and teachers.  So much useful information has been distilled from numerous books and packed into this small book of just over 200 pages.<br />For example, on p.13, you get a list of Ron Brandt's principles of human learning: &quot;People learn what is meaningful to them.  People learn more when they accept challenging but achievable goals.  Learning is developmental.  Individuals learn differently.  Leaning takes place through social interaction.  People need feedback to learn.  Succesful learning involves the use of strategies that themselves are learned.  A positive emotional climate influences learning.&quot;<br /> On the next page, you get another list of Caine and Caine's Twelve Principles of the Mind.  Almost every page is filled with succinct summaries.  Topics covered include: how we learn, memory, the importance of meaning and understanding, brain-compatible instruction, curriculum and teacher development. Senge's views on learning organizations and systems thinking have also been included for developing the school as a learning community.<br />This book is a very good introductory overview.  For follow-up, I'd recommend: Brain-based Learning, Schools that Learn and Ten Steps to a Learning Organization.	2001-06-09

You really learn to appreciate and taste the contemplative, compassionate, accepting, equanimous, present-focused, light-hearted and liberating mindfulness permeating throughout the book.<br />At the recommendation of Fr. Anthony de Mello, 10 Catholic priests, including myself, and 8 Sisters (doing a full-year's Sadhana) had the privilege of following S. N. Goenka, for intensive Vipassana or Insight Meditation retreats at Igatpuri, near Bombay, in India, in 1976. The focal point was on sharpening our awareness of breathing, thoughts, body sensations, feelings and accepting whatever IS without judging.<br />Tara has followed Goenka and many other masters.  She suggests many easy-to-follow exercises for awareness and integration. You pick up such awareness by osmosis in reading the book and practising the exercises.<br />Dalai Lama wrote the Foreword.  Though Buddhists like Goenka, Thich Nhat Hanh, Dalai Lama and many Zen and Tibetan masters have done much to popularise &quot;mindfulness&quot;, you don't have to believe in Buddha to practise such mindfulness.<br />About 3 decades ago, Beisser, summarized the essence of Gestalt Therapy as &quot;The paradoxical law of change&quot;: &quot;When you accept what IS, change occurs.&quot; That is mindfulness.  Charles T. Tart, Andrew Weil and many others have all written on mindfulness without a religious context..<br />Tara not only conveys the spirit of mindfulness here.  She explains the changes in the brain and adopts the framework of Cognitive or Schema Therapy.  Applying mindfulness to our schemas--mental models, ingrained patterns of perception and response or screening filters--is a fruitful path to inner freedom.  10 maladaptive emotional habits and patterns are described: Abandonment, Deprivation, Subjugation, Mistrust, Unlovability, Exclusion, Vulnerability, Failure, Perfectionism, Entitlement.  This is a very concise and illuminating study of developmental psychology.  2 pages on entitlement schema (pp. 93-95) are very relevant for the &quot;Age of Entitlement&quot; (cf. Robert J. Samuelson).<br />From Part I on Emotional Alchemy, you go on to Things as They Seem, then A Mindful Therapy and end in Part IV with Spiritual Alchemy.

This book is incisive, personal, interesting and practical. It gives hope and you are encouraged to &quot;Never, Ever Give Up&quot;.<br />Key ideas are summarised in &quot;Behavior Basics&quot;, usually with sub-headings, at the end of most of the 24 chapters. E.g.  &quot;Three Parenting Styles Likely to Produce or Aggravate Defiance.  1.  Defiant parents.  These people micromanage and come down too hard on kids.  Making every issue a control issue is bound to create more opposition and defiance.  2.  Peacemaker parents.  For varying reasons, these parents will cough up money or stretch themselves to their outer limits-all to avoid conflict.  3.  Apprehensive parents.  &iexcl;Kthese parents don't provide their kids with appropriate discipline and en up parenting out of fear.&quot; (p.21)  If you first look through all these succinct summaries you get a good idea of the book already.<br />Interesting metaphors often convey the points well.  Is our child like a horse, positively motivated and cooperative, or a camel, that sometimes has to be prodded (light a fire under the tail!)?  Does he have &quot;garlic problems&quot; that he bothers others without self-awreness or &quot;bean problems&quot; that he is aware of causing?<br />  The authors advocate a blending of both positive and negative motivations to prepare our children for the real world. They debunk myths about parenting (&quot;Nothing works with these kids&quot;, &quot;It's all biochemical&quot;&iexcl;K).  Praise doesn't work.  But acknowledgements--statements that help the child figure out who he is, are a way of showing appreciation without value judgment. They are useful.  Just give specific description of the behavior noticed. Also distinguish between consequences (asked to clean the room again) and punishment (grounding the child from TV for not cleaning the room).  Consequences teach the child.<br /> Look through &quot;Brain-Dead Phrases You Can Use&quot; (pp. 70-71) or &quot;Scripts for Shutting Down Arguments&quot; (pp.208-9).  Short and simple replies like, &quot;Could be&quot;, &quot;Good try&quot;, &quot;Sorry you feel that way&iexcl;K&quot; can diffuse many unnecessary explosions. This is a practical book for parents, and teachers too.

Michael Hall has made in-depth studies of linguistics and NLP.  He is comprehensive in his search and coverage.  The very brief mention of levels in Meta-model by Lankton in 1980, McMaster and Grinder's Precision Model have all been included here.    <br />It is amazing to find Hall standing on the shoulders of the pioneers and predecessors, critically  summarizing past achievements and creatively integrating and expanding them.  He lives NLP in going to the underlying or meta thinking processes. 9 additional distinctions have been added to the 13 usual patterns of the Metal-model to make up 22 patterns.   <br />The contrast between Korzybski's Non-Aristotelian General Semantics and Aristotle's Laws of thought (identity, contradiction and excluded middle) is very significant.  It helps to know that NLP is another non-Aristotelian system (pp. 105-106) .  But what guides our choice of which system to follow?  Is it just a pragmatic choice?  Can we go deeper into the basis and cognitive processes of our choices? <br />All the &quot;Sleight of Mouth&quot; reframing patterns are summarized as Conversational Magic.   The last chapter on &quot;Magic Beyond Words&quot; honors Vol. II of The Structure of Magic on sensory representational systems and multiple maps. <br />The book truly represents the spirit of NLP, a spirit of inquiry that continually renews whatever has been achieved.  It should be required reading for anyone interested in the use of language and construction of maps for change.   Do not skip the illuminating appendices and charts.  [Examples of Nominalizations on page 67 do not seem to fit.   I can't find any nominalization in &quot;People always push me around.&quot; Or &quot;Everybody feels that way sometimes.&quot;  They are Universal Quantifiers.] <br />  An index in the revised edition would help.

It must have been a daunting challenge for Ted Garratt to condense so much NLP Practitioner and Master Practitioner level material into the book, with additional related resources, such as learning styles, humour, Eric Jensen's brain-based learning... The content is very rich.  Those with a fair amount of background in NLP already can use this book for revision and they'll find many examples of how NLP can be applied in training.  I still wish there could be more examples, and even cartoons and a much more lively editing format. For the NLP illiterates, I'd not recommend this book till they get other introductions first, like David Molden's books.	2001-05-08

He has the gift to present research information and applications in interesting and easily accessible ways.  This book even supersedes the past two in packing so much useful material in 152 pages.  The goal is to help everyone master 3 skills given in the subtitle: how to learn faster, make good decisions and think creatively.  Colin elaborates on the 6 stages of his learning model, using the acronym M.A.S.T.E.R.  M=mind set.  A=acquire the facts.  S=search out the meaning.  T=trigger the memory.  E=exhibit what you know.  R=reflect on how you learned.  The model can be applied to learning organizations too.  Learning and teaching using the book is much helped by numerous cartoon mind-maps, charts, sketches, summaries, quotes, captions, acronyms, training tips, parent tips...  8 multiple intelligences, your preferred senses are succinctly presented and assessed.  There are interesting tidbits of information or advice on almost any page. &quot;Information is doubling every four years.&quot; (p.1)&quot;Tests show that simply shifting a book to the left or right of the body can improve some people's reading speed and understanding!&quot; (p.9)&quot;Separate the personality from the problem!&quot; (p.79)&quot;Want to be sure to remember something important later in the day?

Knowing how to use your brain through &quot;Time-line&quot; does it.  Foreword by Tad James and Preface by Wyatt Woodsmall.  These two co-authored &quot;Time-line Therapy and the Basis of Personality&quot; in 1988.  Bodenhamer and Hall again successfully synthesize and transform traditional NLP (Neuro-linguistic Programming) materials and bring them to new frontiers of understanding and applications.  The ways we code and experience &quot;time&quot; have close connections with our personalities, our thoughts and feelings, states and experiences, beliefs and values, sense of reality and self.  Cultures also differ in their sense of time.  The book gives an in-depth exploration.  We learn how to elicit time-lines and use them to get unstuck from old dated emotions: guilt, grief, fear, anxiety, trauma and abuse... We can also use &quot;Time&quot; as a resource for creating a bright and compelling future, a &quot;life well lived&quot; (borrowed from Benjamin Franklin). Time is not a thing.  We don't manage time, but only ourselves... There is also more advanced material.  Background in NLP is helpful.  [The author's new book, a complete manual for the NLP Practitioner Certification, &quot;The User's Manual for the Brain&quot; includes the introductory section of the present book as the last chapter.] Many chapters are worth repeated study.

Doc Childre talks very simply to teenagers and the teens in everyone and addresses very down-to-earth issues.  He leads us on a journey of self-discovery and helps us to become &quot;heart-smarts&quot;.  This is about tapping into the resources of both the head and the heart, being responsible for one's actions and reactions, building heart security and self-esteem and riding the waves of emotion instead of letting them engulf us.  Creative cartoons convey beautifully the key ideas.  The book ends with &quot;A Few Heart Smart Practices&quot; illustrating how the heart can respond much more resourcefully than the head to situaitons like: a friend snubs you; you feel a parent just doesn't understand you; you don't fit in; feeling bored...  Behind the simple advice are decades of research and team work developing The HeartMath System.  This book is just as useful today after almost a decade since it was first published.

What is school improvement?  It is not control, but EMPOWERMENT. That's why the book is titled: The Power to Learn.  However, visions must be shared and formed collectively.  Curriculum is creatively designed to meet learners' needs.  Activities that promote cognitive. linguistic and social development are essential to teaching and learning.  Intrinsic motivation and development of the school as a community within a community are fostered.  These are the issues discussed in Part A and illustrated by 10 different schools throughout Britain in Part B. You get so many inspiring stories: the school becoming a learning centre for the community, collaborative learning, staff working as a team, parents as partners, respecting different relgious beliefs, creative curriculum, purposeful cooperation...

It is discerning and scholarly.  Different concepts are clearly distinguished and defined.  The authors have critically assessed the literature of diverse models of cognitive styles and only accept two basic dimensions --the wholistic-analytic (tendency to organise information into wholes or parts) and the verbal-imagery (tendency to represent information verbally or in mental pictures).  Cognitive style is an independent construct or psychological notion, not related to intelligence, personality and gender.  It is an important component of individual differences.  It is related to a range of behaviours, including learning performance, social responses and occupational stress.  Style (fairly fixed with probable physiological basis) is also distinct from learning strategy (can be learned).  Riding and Cheema (1991) have developed a computer-based assessment tool, Cognitive Styles Analysis (CSA).  Riding also has a booklet on Personal Style Aswareness (PSA) for personal development. All the representative learning style models associated with a learning-centred tradition are also evaluated.  Part II elaborates on the relationship of style with behaviour.  This is an academic book valuable for understanding the concepts. It is not immediately useful for teachers.	2001-05-03

The authors are admirable in their willingness to make a fair amount of revisions and expand on their book in less than than 2 years.  Such is the speed of change!  This is a very satisfying and useful book.  It is interesting and easy to follow.  Given many good reviews, including those for the first edition, I'll refrain from adding more praise or give any summary ideas.  As Scott Shuster, the Founding Director of Business Week, has said well in the Foreword: &quot;There is no limit to the potential of HeartMath because at root it is a simple, physical act: a mental formation, a thought with physical effects.  It is neither philosophy, faith, nor belief.  The essentially physical character of the practice enables its easy application across all the barriers that customarily divide humanity.... Within this potential universality lies HeartMath's immense promise: If everybody did this, what a wonderful world.&quot;  It won't be surprising if HeartMath becomes as widely known and used as the Microsoft of the world of emotional coherence.	2001-05-01

Though the image is small and resolution poor, it is a great help to attend lectures by these outstanding personalities through this CD.  [Bruce seems to use a predominantly left hand gesture in talking. I wonder if that would indicate more right-brain dominance. When he speaks about coherence, he tends to use both hands more often.]  Key points are summarised in bigger power-point slides that help you to grasp what is being said.  6 relevant questions on the use of HeartMath and IQM (Inner Quality Management)are answered in video clips by many experts.  In the &quot;Tools&quot; section, you get guided audio exercises on Freeze-Frame and Heart Lock-in, various forms for practising HeartMath skills and &quot;Needs Assessment&quot; on when to do what.  Internet links are given to the HeartMath websites and for more case studies and a bibliography of 48 books.  The section &quot;Getting Coherent&quot; gives you various textual tips on being a coherent: &quot;you&quot;, &quot;you as manager&quot; and &quot;your organization&quot;.  &quot;Deep Content&quot; gives most of the book (first edition) in text.  There is a search function for these two sections.  In a revised edition, I hope the texts will be based on the new edition.

If you look through the Table of Contents, you may easily classify the book under &quot;spirituality&quot; with chapters on compassion, surrender, God's creation, deep heart listening, forgiveness, death...  The heart of the book can be summarised, I think, by this paragraph. &quot;As you practice loving each person you meet, you will perceive at deeper levels that earth is all one family, a global family living in one back yard.  The first step of the mathematical equation for fulfillment, one that anyone can do and understand, is to just love the people.  The more people in this stressful world that can build this foundation and take Step 1, the better chance humanity has.&quot; (2nd last page) Yet this is not mere pious verbiage.  Readers are introduced to the scientific basis, world-view and technology of Heartmath.  (Please confer my review of Cut-thru for some background.)  I'd recommend this book in particular to people who are under stress, confused or not finding meaning in life.  Sara's own experiences may inspire them.  My reservations with the book are related to language that is too vague and sweeping.  For example, &quot;Einstein's discovery that everything is energy helped launch a whole new science, Quantum Physics, which states that nothing is really separate from anything else, everything is interconnected and interrelated.&quot; (p. 77)  In reading the crucial chapter on &quot;The Dimensional Shift&quot;, I miss more stringent criteria for each of the 5 dimensions.  And I still don't know what the author's first two dimensions are.  Even though I'm a Catholic priest, I actually feel uncomfortable in Chapter 14's mixing science with faith, using the Big Bang to prove God's creation.  There are more recent evidences of an expanding universe.  But in terms of science, we cannot rule out an eternal pulsating universe before the Big Bang.  Science deals with the realm of knowledge that can be postulated and proved, while faith is in the realm of beliefs, values and meaning. The Genesis story of creation has no implication for how the world developed scientifically.  It only aims at shedding light on the  meaning of life, of each person in face of evil and suffering.  How do you explain light before the creation of the sun on the 4th day?

There is no strict need to read in sequence the 4 parts: Issues, Challenges, Concerns, Realities. Chapters 4 and 5 based on work done from 1981 to 1989 on the Freudian and Jungian perspective of the priesthood are creative pieces on their own.  Most people will probably be stirred up by the very frank discussions of &quot;Betraying Our Young&quot; (clergy misconduct with minors) and &quot;The Priesthood as a Gay Profession&quot; and may be shocked by one (not necessarily reliable) estimate &quot;from 23 percent to 58 percent&quot; of the Catholic clergy having a homosexual orientation. (p.99)  The author is balanced and advocates distinguishing between celibate clergy, straight and gay, who are struggling and sometimes failing to be chaste and those who coolly exploits the priesthood.  The issue of orientation must be faced forthrightly. I like the chapter on &quot;Loving as a Celibate&quot; most, esp. the clarification of intimacy and transcendence.  St Thomas Aquinas has been quoted as saying that &quot;it is unchaste to be unfeeling&quot;. Priests today must become fully human, affective, compassionate and deeply rooted in the transcendent that is not merely other-worldy.  The experience of transcendence can be found in quiet moments of solitude, liturgy, play, meaningful work...  It is characterised by the loss of a sense of time and place.  Simone Weil says, &quot;...a quarter of an hour of attention is better than a great many good works.&quot; (p. 34)  You wish all these chapters could be further developed in depth.  There are so many quotable passages you may want to highlight throughout the book.  The book refrains from any discussion of women priests and married clergy.  Ultimately, it is the priests' rich inner life (including the intellectual), freedom and over-all development, that will sustain them through all the challenges of identity, integrity and mission.  This is a timely and thought-provoking book for all priests and seminarians.e challenges of identity, integrity and mission.

The book does give a fairly comprehensive and up-to-date coverage.  51 meta-programs (from Hall's Figuring Out People) are summarised here.  You also get a more developed understanding of the Meta-model presented with Hall's mastery of linguistics (Cf. Hall's The Secret of Magic).  Chapter 12 on &quot;Figuring Out What Magic To Do At What Times&quot; is a key question that all NLP practitioners want to ask.  Ch. 13 gives brief clues on using NLP in business, education, therapy, sports, health relationships, etc.  What will fascinate people is to note that the whole book was written in E-Prime, i.e., without the verb &quot;to be&quot;!  Read Appendix C: There &quot;Is&quot; No &quot;Is&quot;.  Since NLP deals with mental &quot;maps&quot; rather than the &quot;territory&quot;, identity or reality, such language creates more options and possibilities.  (However, for those interested in fundamental issues in epistemology, it might be worthwhile to explore Bernard Lonergan's monumental &quot;Insight&quot; or Philip McShane's &quot;A History of Tongue&quot;.)  All NLP practitioners can benefit from such a handy and informative reference, at such a reasonable price.  [Please note that the book was first published in 1999, reprinted in 2000.

Much thought and work have been put into designing this book with, high quality paper, colorful cover, many photos, charts and drawings.  The subtitle, &quot;An Introductory Guide to the Art and Science of Excellence.&quot; and the tri-color circle of Do-Think-Feel on the cover, specify the scope and nature of the book.  It is written in simple language without jargons.  Key NLP concepts, presuppositions and applications of NLP are all covered.  Distinctive characteristics of New Code NLP are summarised in two pages.  This book will serve as a great gift to anyone who expresses an interest in knowing more about NLP.	2001-04-18

The author guides you along very skillfully through clear concepts and sequenced activities to build your mental and bodily capabilities, inner resources, strategies, beliefs and confidence for success and team work.  &quot;NLP is not about a selfish search for success at the expense of personal happiness or causing damage to others. It is about achieving higher levels of performance and satisfaction whilst still being entirely true to oneself and, where appropriate, others as well.&quot; (p.7)  Most of the activities or exercises are useful for learning and doing anything with greater improvement and mastery.  The author is sensitive and nuanced in making a fairly comprehensive application of NLP.  For those who haven't been able to attend extended NLP workshops, this book is an excellent initiation.	2001-04-16

She gives numerous reflective questions and illustrates her points with examples.  She considers networking as &quot;The creation, development and use of personal contacts for mutual benefit or for the benefit of others.&quot;  So networking skills are basically communication and goal-setting skills.  Goal-oriented and well-organised personalities are probably doing much of the networking described already.  The contribution of NLP (Neuro-linguistic Programming) lies in helping us to be more aware of the internal mental processes and the impactful use of language.  Chapters 6 to 9 on Communication Skills and rapport building are the most valuable parts of the book. For example, in active Listening, there are 5 stages involved  in conversations: hearing, listening, understanding, acknowledging and responding.  We are also taught many different kinds of Questioning: closed, open, leading, multiple, hypothetical and 3-level questioning (about facts, feelings and values)...(pp.148ff).  The author touched on 4 learning styles: activists, reflectors, theorists and pragmatists.  Different types of intelligence and what helps memory are also briefly mentioned.  For those who don't have any background in NLP , this is a good introduction to its application without any technical jargon.	2001-04-16

After re-reading the book, I like it even more.  This is not a book that some people will take to right away.  It is more like notes or hand-out on 51 therapeutic techniques.  The line drawings of animals by Sandy Beadle have nothing to do with the content.  The authors admit that this is a &quot;weird collaboration&quot;.  When you look through the book again and again, the animals take on personality and emotions.  It is amazing that a few simple lines can be so expressive.  You can just enjoy the art-work.  The sketchy descriptions of each method, with &quot;defintion, rational, examples&quot;, are like the line drawings, simple in outline, but very rich in meaning.  They follow the general order of O'Hanlon's Possibility Therapy: 1. Acknowledgement and Possibility.  2.  Change the Viewing.  3.  Problems and Goals.  4.  Resources.  5.  Change the Doing.  You get the flavour of O'Hanlon's wisdom, his use of stories and simple language and his sense of humour.  You can easily understand why he has been so popular and successful and even appeared on Oprah's Show.  These methods can possibly be developed into game cards not only for therapists, but for anyone interested in growth.  With any skills, we need to practise.  This book helps us to practise in smaller steps and acquire new outlooks and behavior for a more creative living.	2001-04-09

O'Hanlon applies his expertise in Ericksonian hypnosis, solution-oriented therapy and his possibility therapy to life in general. Through simple language without any jargon, and numerous enlightening true stories, he instills hope by freeing people from the past and limited beliefs, and by helping them to stop analyzing and actually change by doing what works, changing their viewing of the problem and applying the 10 solution keys.  He is &quot;painfully aware that life is more complex than anything even the wisest and best-written book can contain.&quot; and quotes Mark Twain's warning: &quot;Be careful about reading health books.  You may die of a misprint.&quot;(p.195) The whole book is precisely the anti-dote to such obsessive and rigid thinking at the root of many of our problems and stuckness.	2001-04-05

He points out the common fallacy of considering music as a &quot;right-brained&quot; activity.  Music affects many different parts of the brain.  Only timbre activated the right hemisphere. Music enhances cognition, emotional intelligence, boosts peformance, heightens motivation.  Reading, perception, motor skills, hearing, behavior and muscle strength are all influenced by music.  Music also affects the immune system, stress, relaxation, blood flow and memory systems.  You get wider coverage than Ch. 17 of the author's &quot;Brained-based Learning&quot;.  You get many different  recommendations for choosing appropriate musical pieces.  Overall, this is a valuable challenge and resource for educators.  One regret is that, compared to the cheaper and most informative &quot;Owner's Manual for the Brain&quot; (P. J. Howard, 831pp.), I'm puzzled why this slim book should be so costly.	2001-04-02

The distinction between explicit learning (test-oriented lecture, textbooks, research, video, and discussion) and implicit learning (dance, theater, physical education, recess, aerobics, energizers, sports, and simple games) is useful.  This book makes a strong case for implicit learning.  Those who are familiar with Jensen's work can expect a good, up-to-date grounding in brain functioning and the scientific basis of various practices.  Most readers will find the book an informative, readable resource. Numerous drawings and charts facilitate the understanding.  &quot;65 all-time best activators&quot; have been selected.  In trying to give an overall coverage, some areas may inevitably be given short shrift.  For example, practitioners of Brain Gym are leading in introducing movement in education with great results based on research. But page 35 says that students of Brain Gym &quot;may be merely benefiting from the extra attention&quot;.  However, the book is unique as a relevant, eye-opening introduction.	2001-04-02

If you want to buy them, often you have to pay exorbitant prices.  This comprehensive, up-to-date, very well-organized manual is a very good buy indeed.  Those who want to seriously study NLP will find this book a great resource.  Others who are familiar with NLP can still find in one book a vast amount of interesting discussions, clear presentations, exercises, and new concepts.  You get clarifications on Michael Hall's &quot;Meta-states&quot; and submodalities, 5 perceptual positions, 21 presuppositions....  The relationship of Chomsky's Transformational Grammar (TG) with the Meta-Model is briefly summarised thus:  &quot;...the Meta-model does not have a marriage with TG--only an affair.  In the fling, it only appropriated the language of linguistics and the idea of levels of information processing.&quot;  You can easily detect the depth of immersion in linguistics to come to this conclusion.  The whole manual reflects a similar depth of mastery of NLP in all the key areas covered for a Practitioner Course.  The detailed Table of Contents gives good leads.  If forced to find fault with the manual, I hope that in another revised edition, there will be the provision of an index also.	2001-03-24

Here we have a different approach based<br />on temperaments and personality differences.  The Myers-Briggs Type<br />Indicator (MBTI) and its developments by David Keirsey serve as the<br />basis for the whole framework.  It is best to first do the MBTI test,<br />or the Keirsey's 2 brief tests, freely accessible on the Internet<br />(also in the book, Please Understand Me). There are already numerous<br />good books on MBTI.  Here the authors make excellent applications to<br />education.  After describing in depth different types in school<br />contexts, you get a useful summary in Table 12, of 4 basic groups of<br />student preferences: Guardian, Artisan, Idealist and Rational.  Ch. 12<br />gives many classroom techniques and a summary chart that help teachers<br />to be more aware of what they can do to match the personality and<br />learning style differences of the students.

The title &quot;I AM the Child&quot; is very significant.  It reflects how Freeman entered into the life and soul of each unique child's multiple challenges and needs.  She literally imitated each severely handicapped child to get the inner sense,  feelings and needs of these 11 exceptional children.  Her compassion, openness, the ability to get the cooperation of each child, teachers, parents and general-ed peers, all helped in the process of tranformation. Reading the book is a spiritual experience.  From the Christian perspective, you see incarnation in becoming another and salvation as wholeness being lived out again and again in these miracles of learning and growth. The subtitle: &quot;Using Brain Gym with children who have special needs&quot; is a great testimony to Brain Gym and Vision Gym, developed by Paul and Gail Dennison.  &quot;These simple movements help stimulate the sensory system, coordinate eyes and hands, and activate core postural muscles, supporting learning from the inside out.(p. 17) Freeman adapted these exercises and was even able to restore sight to one blind child!  For a scientific neurological basis of Brain Gym, please read Carla Hannaford's &quot;Smart Moves&quot;.  What the book conveys is the vision, heart, honesty and courage that inspire every educator and parent.  If only all classrooms would have such personal and competent care  suffused by the spirit of compassion and love!	2001-03-21

Key ideas based on decades of research into Learning Styles and inventory tools are presented very succintly. Low and average achievers make a greater improvement in standardized achievement test scores when their learning styles are matched, esp. through tactile, kinesthetic and global styles. Different alternatives for developing a Learning Style Program are proposed: workshops, self-teaching team, learning styles committee, hire consultants or a development team. Provision of matching resources will be an important next-step.  There is a brief introduction to redesigning classrooms and teaching strategies.  The practical questions that open-minded and dynamic decision-makers have to face are not no longer whether, but how they can find the physical, financial and personnel resources to implement such a daunting programme through viable, gradual and effective processes.	2001-03-16

Steve de Shazer and his wife, Insoo Kim Berg, first distilled the wisdom of Milton Erickson, psychiatrist and hypnotherapist, and developed a very influential school of interventions, without formal hypnosis, for the last 15-20 years. It is the change in perspective in developing new ways of thinking, believing and doing that is most valuable for any person.  In contrast to traditional approaches, the focus is on the student's own competencies, strengths, possibilities and solutions.  Counseling is structured and time limited.  The goals are set jointly by the student and counselor, behavior-oriented, measureable, action-oriented... p. 44. Numerous specific strategies, such as highlighting exceptions, the classic &quot;scaling question&quot; of 1 to 10, that even surfaced in Woody Allen and other movies, the &quot;miracle question&quot;, with the modified &quot;dream question&quot;, the use of &quot;instead&quot;, &quot;coping questions&quot;, &quot;relationship questions&quot;... are all clearly summarised here.  You also get a glimpse of applications of solution-focus to groups, parents, teacher-education and schools. This book is worth repeated study.  The principles and strategies of the solution-focus perspective are not only useful for school counselors, but also for any person in daily life.	2001-03-15

The overall content is still valuable as an introduction, covering the early history of NLP, model of communication, representational systems, anchoring, language patterns--Meta Model and Milton Model, values and criteria, modelling and strategies.  For the fundamental and most valuable &quot;presuppositions&quot; of NLP, you have to refer to their other book, Principles of NLP.

You get an easy digest of current brain studies on different kinds of memory, the relevance of diet and nutrients, the influence of lifestyle, stress and pollution.  Two chapters are devoted to mnemonics and there are numerous tips and strategies for improving memory.  The format of the book with numerous pictures and sketches is very helpful.  Once you master the foundation and the interest is aroused, people can go on to delve more deeply into related areas, such as the more recent books by Rupert Sheldrake, or the applications of NLP (Neuro-linguistic Programming), esp. the submodalities, in enhancing meaning-making, learning and memory...

He has tirelessly<br />campaigned for a truly democratic education based on a much more<br />positive trust in human nature. He wants schools to steer away from<br />tests and grading, punishment and rewards.  In his vision of the<br />classroom, &quot;students play an active role in decisions, teachers<br />work WITH students rather than doing things TO them, and the learners'<br />interests and questions drive much of the curriculum.&quot; (p. 277)<br />This theme runs through the 19 articles, mostly written since 1995,<br />collected here in this volume.

The author borrows many key ideas from NLP(neuro-linguistic programming), learning science and coaching. This is a working manual.  Much of the book is devoted to personal awareness and integration--developing the &quot;Internal Team&quot;, as a basis for building the real &quot;External Team&quot;.  Readers are helped to achieve self-responsibility by working through Bateson's &quot;Logical Levels&quot;, elaborated by Robert Dilts: environment, behaviours, capabilities/skills, beliefs/values, identity, purpose/vision. They are also led to the awareness of one's thinking and communication styles, inner dialogues and motivation needs.  The matching of personal and Team agendas help to develop a Coaching Culture, where individuals are responsible for their own learning goals and motivation.  The appendix gives a ranking tool for selecting one's action.  This is not a book for reading from cover to cover.

It is always interesting and useful to compare different face reading books.  Each claims much success and accuracy and yet different authors have different criteria for interpretation.  Is it because of the vague and general descriptions that we use?  In NLP (Neuro-linguistic Programming) it is called nominalisations, which are specifically used for Ericksonian hypnosis.  So given the rapport, people may give their own meanings to those words and feel how right on they are.  This book is more comprehensive in scope.  The pencil drawings are artistic and very helpful.  Overall, it is a great tool for developing one's sensory acuity in perceving people. But we must read that with a pinch of salt. Face reading is still a long way from being scientifically or statistically reliable.  Some interpretations may have higher validity.  E.g.  the correlations of heart lines (vertical line on ear lobe), p.66, with certain coronary heart problems may be higher.  But not every interpretation.  The Chinese Face Reading system goes into mapping the location for each year on the face. That helps to make interpretations more precise for verification. This is a fascinating field that is worth studying.  We need to work out more systematically the rationale underlying the interpretations.  The present book is a good introduction if we approach it with an open, objective and discriminating mind and have the sensitivity to racial differences also.	2001-03-04

In conclusion, I have very high regard for this field of knowledge, whether it is applied to health or to understanding personalities, one's past and potential future.  It is quite amazing to find that we can verify whether people have tumours, gall stones or note the minute changes before and after an operation by looking at their faces.  It is even more so to see how the lines in the palms change over the years corresponding to their emotional and personality changes.  Face reading is certainly worth serious study.  It is a joy to find this book's ingenious method of using rainbow colored divisions to demarcate different parts of the face for easier learning and application. All the colored drawings are very helpful in picking out the characteristic features.  The summaries and personality analysis at the end help one to apply the &quot;E-Z 10 second personality speed reading system&quot;.  This is a well-produced book. I hope it will be used as a preliminary step to understanding one another instead of categorizing people. We must also be aware that usually we use very general language that's hard to negate. If you point to someone's eyes or mouth and say that she &quot;desires love&quot;, how often will you get a &quot;no&quot; for answer?  The need is to adopt a really scientific attitude and not to cheapen this field of physiognomy. There are many nuances.  You can apply palmistry across the races.  But with face-reading, I think we must be much more sensitive to some racial differences.  Different combinations of features will also give new meanings.  There are also deeper levels that face-reading must also consider, such as the muscles, the bones, the spirit reflected in the eyes and the more ephemeral colors related to energy rather than skin.  These cautions only affirm the value of face-reading as windows to peeping into each person's uniqueness.

It is also a masterpiece for effective communication, teaching and learning based on the author's synthesis of brain-compatible learning.  &quot;The brain is meaning driven.&quot; (p.3) Aligned with the stages of learning, Jensen proposes a seven-steps brain-friendly training model: 1. Neural history.  2. Learning environment.  3. Context for success.  4. Acquisition.  5. Elaboration.  6. Memory encoding.  7. Functional integration.  The format of the book, is compatible to the brain's grasp and understanding, with &quot;Key Topics&quot; for each chapter, numerous key ideas on the margin and in the boxes, headings and bullets.  People with background in NLP (Neuro-linguistic programming)and Ericksonian hypnosis can easily resonate with the stress on states, rapport and the use of language and find it thrilling to get the biological basis to the fundamental aspects of communication: first impressions, states, attention, persuasion, credibility...  The brain's need to balance focused atttention with non-focused &quot;down-time&quot;  reflection to process information for meaning-making, organization, and future recall given in Chapter 9 is just one example of so many interesting, enlightening and useful ideas that the book is full of.  What is satisfying is not just the provision of techniques, but the underlying understanding of how we learn and communicate.  Anyone, esp. teachers, parents can also benefit from reading this book.	2001-03-03

That reflects the pace of the explosion of brain research studies.  The outdated Triune Brain Theory is no longer mentioned. We have: new insights on the dynamic interplay of both nature and nurture; stages of learning that responds to the crucial question of &quot;When has a student learned something?&quot;...  For the serious student of neuroscience applied to learning, this is one of the best books.  It contains so much interesting, useful and up-to-date information.  Just look through the detailed Table of Contents.  Rewards, motivation, creativity, meaning-making, discipline... are all seen in a new perspective. It gives a biological basis to respecting individual differences and learning styles. This new edition, with additional drawings, illustrations, outlines, tips and boxes of key ideas, makes the book attractive and easier to read.  The author is gifted in integrating a lot of research studies and making them relevant and palatable.  He has done a great service to all educators and learners.  (The first edition is still worth keeping.  It contains useful book recommendations for follow-up and other valid materials that have been left out in the revised edition.)	2001-03-02

Implementation.  5. Consequences. 6. Collaboration. 7. Refocusing. 8. Evaluating.  The change agents tend to be idealistic pragmatists--persons who are receptive, open, goal-directed and adaptive.  The management style is collaborative, followed by benevolent despot, and a general rejection of middle-of-the-road approaches.  &quot;What is most strongly denounced is laissez-faire, which suggests a chaotic, permissive approach characterized by the educator who buries his or her head in the sand of the organization on a regular basis, allowing staff members to do their own thing.&quot; (pp. 66-67)  The world needs good leaders.

This book, after two very condensed and up-to-date summaries of the theory and practice, gives more success stories of using learning-styles-based teaching in diverse settings in higher education.  It is a report and does not give practical tools.  After reading a number of such reports, I have a query.  Each person's learning style is biologically and developmentally determined.  To what extent can we change that?  If teachers can change their teaching styles, can we use the Learning Styles Model as a guide to help students to develop more flexibility in learning?  After all, we may not always have people in our personal and professional life, who will match our learning styles.  In a society that depends a lot on the visual mode for success, could we first teach all children to be more visual in learning and achieve greater positive outcomes without depending on teachers to match our own style of learning?  I'd like to see more future research done in this direction instead.	2001-02-28

Detailed illustrations of various designs and techniques that will match the learning styles are given.  It is important for teachers and administrators to first do the &quot;Productivity Envrionmental Preference Survey (PEPS)&quot; and for the students to do the &quot;Learning Style Inventory (LSI)&quot; which are available separately.  Please note that &quot;The inventory does not measure underlying psychological factors, value systems, or the quality of attitudes&quot;(p.35).  Table 2-1 gives a graphic overview of interpreting LSI profile.  You get a good sense of the diversity among students.  It is quite a daunting challenge to implement such a lerning-style based programme.  The chart on p. 449 gives an overview of 4 stages.  Some schools, with classrooms of 40+ students (e.g. in Hong Kong), may not have the physical space to incorporate the environmental changes required. Also where can we find in a regular school so many flexible and resourceful teachers who can creatively go beyond their usual learning and teaching styles?  The awareness of the Dunns' comprehensive framework of learning styles is certainly most valuable and it helps us to be less judgemental and more respectful of individual gifts.  I wonder if it would be an acceptable application to methodically stretch the whole class' learning styles, e.g., to be more visual or both global and analytic?  Maybe more research can be done using these small steps of expanding one's learning and teaching styles.	2001-02-28

The Dunns proposed a broader understanding of &quot;giftedness&quot;, not as a label, but as a measure of accomplishments.  If we identify the child's learning styles and be sensitive to the varying needs of different developmental stages, all children can become more gifted.  Though this book was written almost 10 years ago, I'm glad that it is still available.  It is a simple, very readable and practical book--an excellent introduction to the Dunn's basic ideas.

Much research (by more than 115 tertiary instituitions) and applications have been done using their Learning Style Model with very positive results. &quot;Learning style is the way each person begins to concentrate on, process, internalize and retain new and difficult academic information (p.11).  There are five basic stimuli with 23 elements.  1. Environmental (sound, light, temperature and seating-design).  2. Emotional (motivation, persistence, responsibility, i.e. conformity/non-conformity, and structure).  3. Sociological or people patterns (learning alone, with peers, team, adult or with a variety). 4.  Physiological (perceptual: auditory, visual, tactual, kinesthetic; time-of-day energy level, intake and mobility). 5. Psychological (global vs. analytic, hemisphericity, impulsive vs. reflective).  These are summarised in a sketch chart that is found in many of the Dunns' books.  This book gives excellent up-to-date coverage of the basics and research studies and provides detailed material for teachers to experience the process of learning styles themselves.  One query is the choice of the outdated and simplisitic Triune Brain Theory for much of the illustrations.  It was first presented by Dr. McClean in 1949.  However, its simplicity might help us to better grasp the different designs that will match different learning styles.  If all in-service teachers could go through this system of personal development, they would be much better equipped to identify learning styles and design the challenging and much needed tactual (touching and manipulating materials) and kinesthetic (whole-body movement and real-life experiences) resources.  So are the abilities to design Contract Activity Package (CAP) to help students to learn at their own speed and Programmed Learning Sequences (PLS) for independent small-step learning.  Education will finally nurture the &quot;giftedness&quot; in every child--an overriding dream, I believe, underlying all the Dunns' books and work.ess&quot; in every child--an overriding dream, I believe, underlying all the Dunns' books and work.	2001-02-27

This book does not explain the learning style.  It covers 33 success stories and may inspire other school leaders to follow the principle, &quot;when children do not learn the way we teach them, we must teach them the way they learn&quot; (p. xii). &quot;Seeing students snacking in class, working in various social groups, listening to portable cassette players, learning through huge kinesthetic floor games, and sitting on classroom floors is not uncommon...&quot; (p. 11).  The consistent postive outcomes over the years are the dreams of school adminstrators and teachers.  The path in adopting the Dunn and Dunn Learning Style Model throughout a school is of course not that simple.  So it is very valuable to get the experience and tips of these innovative, dedicated and admirable leaders.  But much of the book is a record report written by diverse authors, succintly expressed in the title above, borrowed from Rita Dunn.  You can glean some key ideas for future reference or be just inspired and feel greater enthusiasm for educational reforms.	2001-02-26

Alfie Kohn continues to ask probing questions to challenge our assumptions and beliefs and prods us to see things from the child's perspective. Instead of being concerned with classroom management and control--getting children to do what we want, we should first ask, &quot;What do children need?,&quot; and &quot;How can we meet those needs?&quot;. Very often discipline problems arise, not, as it is commonly believed, out of the students' personal problems or the need for attention or power.  Rather it is just because the adults' demands may be unreasonable, or the curriculum may be irrelevant.  &quot;When students are 'off task', our first response should be to ask, 'What's the task?'&quot; (p.19). Coercion, use of punishment and rewards, any control measures are not achieving our common goals in fostering depth of understanding, independence of thinking, continuing motivation to learn and concern for others.  Students should have their say, participate in making decisions, be given autonomy and responsibility.  Students must feel cared about and be encouraged to care about others.  Only caring relationships build community.  Competition is the worst enemy.  Suggestions on building community, solving problems together were given.  Also answers to ten common objections.  For educators who value democracy, this is  a worhtwhile book.	2001-02-23

All the well-researched arguments against incentives, rewards and even praise, are still just as valid today.  Most people may hesitate to use explicit punishment but hold such deep-rooted beliefs in using rewards.  &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot; is a captivating title and it shocks people into some awareness of such futile and self-defeating behavior.  The author has a fundamental belief in the goodness of the human nature, the intrinsic desire to learn and he attempts to lay a true foundation for democratic attitudes and practices. Praise is all right as feedback, but any external means of control is counter-productive to fostering true learning and community building.  He has the vision of &quot;Good Kids Without Goodies&quot;, education not based on rewards, grades and competition and he advocates the 3 Cs:  collaboration (learning together, content (things worth knowing) and choice (autonomy in the classroom).  Some may feel he is too utopian.  But such a clear-thinking, passionate, challenging and persuasive writer deserves careful study, debate and reflection.	2001-02-22

The authors have distilled much practical wisdom from their extensive experience and reading.  They successfully share that with the readers through assessment tools to help us discover the child's predominance in 5 dispositions, 12 talents, interests, thinking modality and environment factors.  I like most the numerous boxes of quotes and statements. The assessments, reference charts, resource exercises are best used on individual basis.  But it would be hard for teachers to implement them if you believe in the quote from Peter Kline:  &quot;If you add up the amount of undivided individual attention most students get during their twelve years in school, it probably comes to about three to six school days' worth.&quot; (p.6)  The rationale underlying the choice of 5 dispositions and 12 talents is not too clear.  Are there well-established personality and cognitional theories?  How do the talents differ from multiple intelligences?  Howard Gardner only came round to recognising 8 and half intelligences.  If we put aside such technical issues, this book is an excellent introduction in fostering our positive regard and respect for each child's genius and unique differences.	2001-02-20

The authors have surveyed the field and, much influenced by Drs. Rita and Kenneth Dunn's pioneering work, came up with the &quot;synthesized learning style model&quot;.  It is a broad framework that includes 5 learning systems: 1. emotional (need to be), 2. social (need to belong), 3. cognitive (need to know), 4. physical (need to do) and 5. reflective (need to reflect).  Readers should first check through the 25 items of &quot;Teacher Belief Systems&quot; on p. 17 to see if they are really open to adopting such student-centred attitudes and behavior.  Short of doing a formal &quot;Learning Style Inventory&quot;, the authors listed numerous questions for identifying the &quot;Interactive Observational Style&quot; based on the 5 learning systems.  There were references to impressive, successful outcomes when traditional teaching was transformed into learning-styles education.  However there will always be the big challenge, esp. in established schools, in finding enough principals and teachers with the same mind and heart to implement education based on indvidual differences.  (There is a useful annotated bibliography at the end.  Given the fast development, esp. in neuroscience applied to learning, the list should be updated already.)	2001-02-19

Ideally, people in any organization should start with the assessment tool and go sequentially through all the ten steps: 2. promote positive, 3. safe thinking, 4. risk taking, 5. people as resources, 6. learning power, 7. map the vision, 8. model the vision, 9. systems thinking, 10. get show on the road.  But there are so many useful guidelines, stories and exercises, you can dip into any page and be enriched and enlightened.  Just take &quot;16 principles that promote learning&quot; (pp. 16-19) or the 36 assessment items (pp. 66-67), they are very specific goals for us to aim at.  &quot;Why most training doesn't work&quot; (pp. 168-171) should be required reading for all trainers. In fact, the whole book should be required reading by all those in management or interested in fostering growth through participative learning.  For follow-up, it helps to read Peter Kline's The Everyday Genius, that gives a more comprehensive background to the Integrative Learning that underlies the present book.  People can also go on to Peter Senge and team's books--if they haven't done so. In another revised edition, it might help to include an index and also update the checklist on 7 multiple intelligences to include the natural and existential intelligences.	2001-01-07

In Part One, the author persuasively pointed out the 5 fatal flaws in traditional education that relies on extrinsic measures, rote memory and hard work rather than native interest, actual learning, thinking and understanding.  The harm of confusing one's self-worth (identity) with performance (behavior) is so in-built into everyone through such a system! Part Two clarifies and illustrates what better education consists of .  &quot;The goal is to create a learning experience that arouses and sustains children's curiosity, enriching their capacities and responding to their questions in ways that are deeply engaging.&quot; (p.130)  It is learner-centred, democratic and cooperative.  The author devotes much space to defending Whole Language approach that helps students &quot;learn to read by reading&quot;.  He has the knack in giving succinct captions, e.g. &quot;What versus How Well&quot;, &quot;Harder is Better&quot;, &quot;Beyond the Right Answer&quot;, &quot;What Replaces Grades&quot;&iexcl;K  He raises many probing questions and challenges the research evidence quoted by the Old School. He writes with passion and gives wise cautions so that progressive school reforms won't founder. (p. 183)  One big hurdle to any educational reform is to have enough teachers who will be able to implement the vision and make education so interesting and appropriate for students.  Another reservation is that no matter what our approach is, most probably we'd still get a fair portion of those who do well and many who don't. E.g., cooperative project work can be done by only one diligent member of a team.  The author at least arouses much controversy and reflection.  Though the author is careful not to impose his own assumptions of the purpose of schools (pp. 117-120), given his competence, I hope he could spell out more clearly in a sequel his whole philosophy of education, the assumptions of the human good and learning that education seeks to serve instead of relying on sporadic quotes ......more clearly in a sequel his whole philosophy of education, the assumptions of the human good and learning that education seeks to serve instead of relying on sporadic quotes ......	2001-01-04

He considers leadership as a journey and I like his analogy of a flock of birds. There is no one leader issuing orders all the time.  Yet there is a larger intelligence that keeps the group together in very fluid formation.  &quot;The more the individuals use their own intelligence to the full for themselves, the smarter the group becomes.&quot; p.xi.  O'Connor uses not only NLP, but also systems and complexity thinking in a very integrated way without technical jargons.  You are invited to join this journey of growth as a leader.  Start with reflections on your own goals and vision.  The questions and exercises, &quot;thought experiments&quot;... throughout the book are excellent maps for readers to explore their own mind and values.  Basic distinctions between leadership and authority, managing and leading, Roman law and common law, leaders or winners and losers' mentality, the use of values in contrast to extrinsic rewards in motivation... are illuminating.  We are also helped to have a good understanding of trust and values, beliefs and assumptions.  The extention of NLP's perceptual positions of self, other and objective view into a fourth perspective of context of a wider system and a fifth perspective of change through time shows the richness of systems thinking.  Overall, this is an execllent guide for those willing to embark on this transforming journey and work through the exercises in acquiring both understanding and skills as a leader.	2000-11-14

The authors have focused on the key components of building winning culture and high-performance teams.

The listing of &quot;Ineffectual Organizational Habits (old culture) in contrast to &quot;High Performance Behaviors (desired culture) on p. 51, the &quot;high-performance pyramid&quot; chart on p. 136 and the table of &quot;Transitions Toward Leadership in 21st Century&quot; on p. 172 alone are already worth the price of the book.

You get an in-depth understanding of the times and spirit of the first  Jesuits through the analysis of the the key-words of the text.  There are  many gems in the copious footnotes also.  E.g., &quot;...According to the  accepted system, the clergy prayed, the nobles protected, and the people  provided, but down the ages the peasant experience has often been that the  clergy preyed, the nobles preyed, and the people prayed and paid...&quot;  (p.444)  Against the background of so much corruption and immorality in the  Church, you get inspired by the author's unravelling of the inner core of  the lives and dedication of so many people, Francis, Dominic and the first  Jesuits... who responded so totally to the Impelling Spirit.

Though you'll miss the  energy and transforming effect of the experience in a whole group, you can  still get the flavour of the stories and various exercises. Robert Dilts  and Robert McDonald are excellent facilitators and presenters.  In contrast  to the early arrogance in the NLP world, bragging quick fixes and all kinds  of techniques for change, this book and the seminars it was based on, bring  a much fuller perspective of death and shadow, rebirth, the  &quot;heart&quot; and the spiritual dimension into NLP.  People with  apriori definitions, prejudices and expectations whenever  &quot;Spirit&quot; is mentioned may have difficulty with such a book.  But  for anyone interested in growth into wholeness, this book is an excellent  tool.  Robert Dilts' article in appendix B, &quot;Bringing Light Into the  Darkness: The Principle of Positive Intention&quot;, if really understood  and lived, will already transform the world.	2000-06-21

I'd consider Robert Dilts' recent Modeling  with NLP and the present volume as the new definitive landmark publications  in the development of NLP.  Sleight of Mouth will help beginners understand  why NLP is not just a passing fad, but continues to be of such great  service in freeing and enriching people.  It is also something that all of  us can learn and master.  For someone like myself, who was first exposed to  such language patterns from the very beginning close to 20 years ago, I  continue to grow in my understanding and appreciation for the scope and  application of these patterns.  As Robert explained, &quot;It has only been  in the last several years that I have gained enough insight and  understanding about how beliefs are formed and held cognitively and  neurologically that I feel able to make the deeper structures underlying  Sleight of Mouth sufficiently clear and concise.&quot; (Preface, xii)  The  subtitle, The Magic of Conversational Belief Change, is very apt.  It  continues to be magic.  Key concepts like, frames, reframing, chunking,  values, criteria, structure of beliefs, belief change and &quot;thought  viruses&quot; are all lucidly explained, with practice exercises.  The  whole NLP world is grateful to Robert and eagerly awaits any future  publications by him.	2000-06-21

It offers a most valuable technique: recognize and freeze the stressful frame of life, shift  away from the mind and focus on the heart, step into a resourceful state,  tap into one's heart intelligence,  and come up with alternative solutions.  Much sound research by people like Rollin McCraty and William A. Tiller  undergirds such simple techniques.  It works and it is so streamlined and  clearly packaged that anyone can learn and master. I hope it will continue  to serve many people.  That is why I rate the book with 5 stars.  My one  reservation in reading through all the seven books by the author and a few  others by the staff of the HeartMath Institute is the authors'tendency to  reduce all the beautiful research down to a few key techniques and concepts  repeated over and over in most of the books.  I long for further  developments.  Coming from a background immersed in NLP (Neuro-Linguistic  Programming), I hope people can be taught to generate their own techniques  in changing their perceptions and develop a fuller and resourceful life by  tapping into the unique role of heart intelligence.	2000-06-19

It is based on the close cooperation of four separate university research units of  &quot;a twelve-year study of a large  and scientifically precious national sample of 720 pairs of adolescent  siblings and their parents&quot; screened from hundreds of thousands of  households.  One is left in awe by the humility and caution in drawing  inferences, the thoroughness of research and the respect for truth of the  scientific spirit of inquiry.  Readers are guided through the journey into  the mind of the scientists and their various reasons for the methodology  and choices for the collaborative project.  &quot;The Relationship Code  provides a blueprint for what the next two decades of developmental study  might bring--more nuanced portrayals of how biological, psychological, and  social processes contribute to the unfolding of lives.&quot; (Foreword by  Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, Columbia University).  The book is unique in  integrating research on both psychosocial and behavioral genetic influences  in adolescent development.  In contrast to most traditional studies,  it  includes step-families of at least 5 years and focused more on nonshared  environments in the family, i.e.,  what is unique to different siblings  that may account for individual differences.  (E.g., a depressed mother  withdraws from one of her children but not another, a child born after a  recent death in the family may be treated differently, different peer  groups or life events and percetual &quot;bias&quot;.)  In  &quot;thesis&quot;, the author reported the impact of environment on  psychological development.  But in &quot;antithesis&quot;, it sheds much  light on the genetic influences on the seven measures or domains of  adolescent adjustment: antisocial behavior, depression, cognitive agency,  sociability, autonomy, social responsibility and self-worth.  Also what was  formerly considered environmental factors in family systems may have roots  in the genes.  In &quot;synthesis&quot; it stressed that genetic and  family factors are both important.  &quot;Our proposal is not simply that  the environment has a general and non-specific facilitative or preparatory  role in the behavioral expression of genetic influences, but rather that  specific family processes may have distinctive and necessary roles in the  actual mechanisms of genetic expression. &quot; (p. 420)  Relationships  seem to encode genetic development and expression--thus the title of the  book.  Biology is not destiny. Though the authors, as scientists, are still  tentative in proposing such hypothesis, the whole nature-nurture debate is  henceforth never either-or, but shifted to a more precise level of how  after this study.  This is a scholarly and technical book.  The main  author, David Reiss, in four and a half years, has given an excellent  report and has painstakingly made the readers' task much easier by  presenting most of the data in numerous graphic charts and reserved the  tabular data in the appendix.  All those interested in education and growth  are much indebted to the whole team's contributions, to their  &quot;extraordinary synergy of talent, enthusiasm, and dedication, along  with grueling and meticulous work&quot; (p. xv).environmental factors in family systems may have roots  in the genes.

It is best to start with the 15 minute casette introduction so that you get an overview of the whole book.  Of course the unique feature of this pack and all the others in the series, esp. The Art Pack and the Architecutre Pack, are the ingenious  pop-ups and inserts.  Many topics are covered in a very interesting, though  sketchy manner.  You have chapters on the structure of the brain, emotions,  the senses, consciousness, gender diffrences, intelligence, language, and  memory.  Hopefully, once the curiosity is aroused, one will go on to  explore each topic in depth elsewhere.  The inclusion of an up-to-date and  select list of further readings would be helpful.  For example, 'brain  food' is so skimpy in coverage.  To know that there is such a mine of  useful knowledge in The Miracle Brain may do some justice to the topic.   This is not a book for children to read on their own.  Neither is it  suitable for public libraries because there is no way to keep all the loose  booklets, aids and games intact.  But it would be useful for each family to  have. Parents can play with their children and explain to them the content  using this pack.  The past Decade of the Brain has advanced our knowledge  immensely in this area.  The Brain Pack is an alluring gateway to the most  important treasure we all carry within us.	2000-04-29

The subtitle, &quot;simple strategies to make your relationships work&quot; may be misleading.  It is more than that.  As it is stated in the preface,  &quot;This book is not, however, about how to change or manipulate others  into being what you want them to be.  Nor is it about trying to fit into  other people's expectations regardless of your own point of view.  It is  about being more yourself, putting more of yourself into a relationship and  letting the other person be themselves too...&quot;  What a beautiful goal!  The two co-authors have the gift in guiding us along in very simple  language, metaphors, anecdotes and questions.  They help us grow in  understanding our biological, social and intellectual dimensions, or what  they call &quot;voices&quot;.  They have distilled much wisdom from current  literature on relationship, genetic factors, male and female differences  and give life to the vision and concepts of NLP without any technical  jargon.  Instead of acquiring specific strategies or techniques, one grows  through developing the different perspectives and reflecting on oneself,  one's wants and shared goals, and learning how to change and love with  commitment.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in  life-long growing, esp. in relating.	2000-04-28

There are also many suggestions for integration.  One needs  to go beyond the simplistic right/left brain dominance theories and even  the 8 or 9 multiple intelligences.

Gower publisher has proved to be disappointing again. For those who don't have any knowledge of NLP  (Neuro Linguistic Programming), the book can still be useful for picking up  some basic ideas of NLP and how they can be applied to the trainer.  But  the book is full of platitudes:  the world is changing, training should  change, training needs to be proactive rather than reactive, be more  customer oriented.... The regurgitation of the NLP concepts and principles  are rather dry.  The detailed prescriptions for the trainer probably  reflect the author's own personality tendencies.  For those familiar with  Myers-Briggs, she is probably very high in Judging, wanting things to be  methodic and systematic.  Someone high in Perception wants much more  spontaneity and cannot tolerate such straight-jackets. A good trainer,  especially when trained in NLP, models what he/she teaches.  Here we miss  the rich and lively communication of stories, metaphors and illustations  that lead to understanding and unconscious assimilation and mastery.  However, those who seriously follow through all the listed steps, I trust  they can still benefit much from the book.	2000-04-12

Anne Linden, who was the first to have combined the two systems in one book,  wrote the Foreword. The present book has advanced much further in helping  us to understand the diversity of the nine types of personalities and  teaching us to flexibly match such differences with the powerful attitudes,  patterns and skills of NLP.  Part I is based on NLP.  But it is not just a  regurgitation of the key concepts.  The author reflects real understanding  and creatively and lucidly applies NLP to selling or congruent influence.  Part II gives succint descriptions of the Enneagram types.  The  Identification Tips, Dominant NLP Patterns, Rapport Tips and Selling Tips  for each type are unique features.  Part III integrates NLP, the Enneagram  with classical selling techniques.  &quot;31 Assumptions of Personality  Selling&quot; lists the key concepts of the whole book.  Very interesting  and useful. &quot;Different people respond differently to the same thing,  and the same thing can cause different responses in different people.&quot;  (pp.29, 284) Personality Selling succeeds very well in coaching us to  respond effectively to such differences.	2000-04-12

Since 1975 Robert Dilts has been one of the most fertile minds in  consistently applying and creatively developing NLP.  He has the rare gift  in collaborating and co-creating with so many talented people in workshops  and projects (to many of these he dedicates the present book). He is also  able to model people in history through writings and biographies.  His  vision, productivity and leadership abilities have enriched NLP immensely  and benefited humankind.  The whole NLP community worldwide owes a great  debt to him.  This book is an excellent example of how Robert continues to  be of service to anyone who wants to learn and use NLP.  Here he has put  together what many of us have been learning through his workshops in the  past two decades, the key components of modeling.  For those who have some  background in NLP, it is helpful to master this book first.  This is the  first comprehensive account of the NLP modeling process.  Other books only  give piece-meal strategies.  Once we grasp the whole view, if we go on to  his previous books and reports on various modeling projects, we would have  a much better sense of the kind of processes which are being applied. Tools  for Dreamers, the 3 volumes of Strategies of Genius, Dynamic Learning,  Skills for the Future, Visionary Leadership Skills will all help to  concretise our assimilation of the modeling process--the heart of NLP.	2000-04-12

The authors have integrated a broad background of expertise in NLP, communication and management studies, multiple intelligences... in coming  up with a short and  easy-to-use test that sheds light on:  1.  Communication style--visual, auditory, or kinesthetic.  2. Life and work  preferences--people, places, information, activities, or things. 3.  Motivational style--toward-away, proactive-reactive, big picture-detail,  etc.  4. Time orientation--past, present, or future. The test is most  useful in one's personal and professional life. Besides the sensory  preferences, the test also elcits what is known in NLP as meta-programs,  higher level filters of experience that guide our motivations.  (Rose-Charvet's Words That Change Minds will be an excellent follow-up on  the use of meta-programs.) One can learn a fair amount of practical NLP  from the guidebook.  The mapping of the profile with seven intelligences  and Myers-Briggs is interesting.  In an updated version, there should be at  least eight multiple intelligences to include the &quot;naturalistic  intelligence&quot;, evident in Darwin and possibly a ninth,  &quot;exitential&quot;, according to Gardner. Overall, this is a most  valuable book.  For those who wish to do the tests on computer, there is a  soft-ware version too.	2000-04-12

I also had joined a number of  Tony's retreats and conferences.  Tony had the special gift in touching so  many lives and was instrumental in their transformation.  After more than  25 years, I continue to find sustenance in his writings. This book,  translated from the Spanish, is an excellent introduction to Tony's  recurrent themes on being free from illusions and any fixed ideas of God,  self and the world.  He is like a Zen master, guiding people to  enlightenment through anecdotes, stories and practical meditative  exercises.  The fundamental and universal human aspirations for: peace,  happiness, life, freedom, love, prayer, liberation, spirituality and  healing are all responded to in these conferences.  You can dip into any  page and find much nourishment.  This is true of all his writings, tapes  and videos--if you relate to him with the awareness of one's hunger and  poverty of spirit and not trying to scrutinise him for doctrinaire  orthodoxy.  Do not mistake the finger which only points to the Mystery and  Source which can never be fully conceptualised as the Moon.

The key concepts of the early Neuro  Linguistic Programming (NLP), with the emphasis on relationship, the use of  language, especially the meta model, the use of various types of reframing  are all illustrated with specific examples, transcripts and stories.  The  book is easy to read and one gets a good understanding of the foundations  of NLP and its applications to therapy.

There are dozens, if not hundreds of  books published on NLP in numerous languages.  For the seriously  interested, I usually recommend Joseph O'Connor and Jane Seymour's  Introducing NLP. For those who want an initial understanding, the present  book remains one of the best guides. So many people turn to NLP for quick  techniques of change.  The present book starts with the &quot;Four Pillars  of Wisdom&quot;: rapport, outcome, sensory acuity and flexibility in the  context of the different logical levels: environment, behaviour,  capability, belief, identity and spirituality. The authors rightly  emphasize the very positive attitudes, the spirit or presuppositions  underlying NLP.  They have also succintly explained all the key concepts  and repertoire of NLP: state, anchors, representational systems, eye  accessing cues, submodalities, timelines, associated and dissociated  states, modelling, strategies, beliefs and the different uses of language.  Short of any opportunity for attending a NLP workshop, this book gives an  excellent initiation.	2000-04-11

It is limited to the introductory level, covering such basic skills as identifying representation systems and the various Meta  Model language patterns.  There are many more NLP training manuals  published since then.  They can be followed beneficially without the  workbook format. NLP also keeps advancing all the time.  Just in the use of  language, besides the Meta Model, we need to learn the Milton Model of  hypnotic language patterns and the more comprehensive and sophisticated  patterns summarised in Robert Dilts' Sleight of Mouth.

His Introducing NLP (1990)and Principles of NLP (1996) are still the best  introductions that I continue to recommend to those interested in the  subject.  In the present small book he has gone further in utilising NLP  insights without any technical lingo at all.  Through personal anecdotes,  guided exercises and clear explanations, he helps us to change our outlook  and ways of thinking so that we'll successfully and easily live a much  fuller life with clear goals, less pain, worry and stress and much more  appreciation and resourcefulness.  Once we learnt the difference between  being inside and outside an experience, we can change our internal videos,  self-talk and do mental rehearsals.  We can also welcome criticisms.  This  book is especially recommended to those who are new to NLP.  I wish the  author will continue to write more books in this format.	2000-04-11

Bernard Lonergan, S.J.(1904-1984), though still not commonly known, was, talent-wise, certainly one of the top thinkers of the 20th century.  It takes time for his thoughts to be appreciated, developed and applied.   There are already numerous web-sites and hundreds of books, articles and  theses written on his ideas. He might be publicly acknowledged as one of  the 100 most influential thinkers by the end of this century.  For more  than forty years, his works continue to nourish and challenge people,  initially in seminary circles, and gradually in different universities.  Boston College has been a key base for over 20 years in fostering studies  of Lonergan's thought and stimulating dialogue with people in diverse  fields. Insight remains one of the basic books that one needs to master if  we want to reach up to Lonergan's mind, just as he reached up to the mind  of Aquinas. One of the perennial issues underlying human differences is our  assumptions about knowing and reality.  What is it to know?  Is it taking a  look out there?  Or do we presume that we cannot know reality? Lonergan  proposed an arduous journey for all of us to become aware of what we are  doing when experiencing, understanding, judging and choosing.  The focus is  on appropriating or gaining self-knowledge of our recurrent cognitional  processes and structures in knowing.  &quot;Kit is essential that the  notion of insight, of the accumulation of insights, of higher viewpoints,  and of their heuristic significance and implications, not only should be  grasped clearly and distinctly but also, in so far as possible, should be  identified in one's own personal intellectual experience.&quot; (p.xx)  &quot;Thoroughly understand what it is to understand, and not only will you  understand the broad lines of all there is to be understood but also you  will possess a fixed base, an invariant pattern, opening upon all further  developments of understanding.&quot; (p.xxviii) This is a difficult,  painstaking and challenging task, not achieved just by reading from cover  to cover (785 pages plus 30).  Lonergan's examples from mathematics,  physics, classical and statistical investigations might be a hurdle to  those who don't have background in such disciplines.  Insight is like the  Zen master's finger pointing towards the moon.  One must be careful not to  get lost in the sweeping and erudite visions and constantly come back to  appropriating one's own knowing processes. This is not a book for the  faint-hearted.  One easier introduction is Terry J. Tekippe's &quot;What is  Lonergan Up to in Insight? A Primer&quot;.  Then one can go on to  Flanagan's Quest for Self-Knowledge, and The Lonergan Reader, edited by the  Morellis, and finally come to grapple with the full original and Lonergan's  later works on Method in Theology and Macroeconomic Dynamics.	2000-04-10

They have  researched and tapped into a central resource, the &quot;heart  intelligence&quot; or HQ used in the Chinese translation of The HeartMath  Solution.  The &quot;heart&quot; is not merely the symbolic seat of wisdom  and feelings, common in many cultures, such as the Chinese and Hebrew, but  an actual organ of intelligence. The author made useful distinctions  between Care and Overcare,  Lower and Higher Heart Feelings and proposed  Cut-Thru techniques that teach people how &quot;to cut thru the gordian  knot&quot; of emotional stress.  Caring for yourself and balanced care for  others release good hormones, raises anti-aging DHEA, while overcare  induces stress and increases cortisol. Lower heart feelings are sentiment,  attachment, expectation and sympathy.  Higher heart feelings are genuine  love, care, appreciation, compassion, patience, humor, courage,  forgiveness, security and kindness. The heart is more than just a  mechanical pump.  Like the brain, it influences information-processing  capabilities.  The heart has its own electromagnetic fields and it informs  the brain and directly affect perception, reaction speeds, and  decision-making ability. &quot;Cut-Thru practice allows heart, emotions,  brain, and mind to entrain and become coherent, giving you the coherent  power needed to access this dimension of your own intuitive  intelligence.&quot;  Anxiety and stress induce incoherent heart  frequencies.  The whole concept of COHERENCE is a fascinating focus for  further studies. Here we not only have innovative theories based on  research, corroborated by recent writings like, Molecules of Emotion,  Second Brain, but also a whole series of techniques to develop such  resources.  If it doesn't get over-commercialized and deteriorate into a  passing fad, Heart Intelligence will greatly benefit humankind. Cut-Thru is  very easy to read and follow.  However, if you just want to read one book  on the work of IHM, The HeartMath Solution may be a more comprehensive and  updated choice, with other extremely useful techniques, such as  Freeze-Frame and Heart Lock-In.assing fad, Heart Intelligence will greatly benefit humankind.
