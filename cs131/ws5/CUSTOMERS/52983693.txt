Jack Reacher, former Army MP and hero of eight previous thrillers, returns this month in One Shot, the latest action-packed adventure from Lee Child, a book tailor-made for fast and friendly summer reading. <br /> <br />The story begins as a lone gunman opens fire on the crowded plaza of a Midwestern city. When the smoke clears, five bystanders are dead. Quickly taken into custody, the suspect refuses to answer any questions or offer any explanation. All he will say is \\"Get Jack Reacher.\\" <br /> <br />One Shot is filled with the kind of pulse-pounding action and thrills Child writes with the skill of a master. Reacher, one of the most popular characters in contemporary thrillers, is the perfect hero for the action movie audience -- loved by women, feared by men and respected by all. <br /> <br />Although Reacher novels are not exactly realistic, you don't read a book like One Shot for reality. You read it to escape from reality. Child helps readers do that better than just about anyone else.	2005-06-25

For those searching for a little more action in their reading diet, you could do no better than Barry Eisler's Killing Rain (Putnam, $24.95), the fourth in a series featuring Japanese-American assassin John Rain, a contract killer who specializes in the \\"natural causes\\" hit. <br /> <br />Rain is hired by the Mossad to eliminate an Israeli arms dealer operating in Manila. At the crucial moment, though, the target's young son appears on the scene, causing Rain to freeze. The arms merchant escapes and Rain's hesitation haunts him, his conscience plaguing him for the first time with self-doubt. <br /> <br />After three action-packed adventures, culminating in last year's stand-out Rain Storm, Eisler has taken his latest book in a slightly different direction, focusing less on the adrenaline, and more on the psyche of John Rain. The result is a more introspective and deeply nuanced story, and a richer look into the heart and mind of this compelling killer. <br /> <br />Even given that change of focus, Killing Rain still features plenty of thrills and tense moments, as well as the beautifully rendered exotic settings that have become the series' trademark. All in all, Killing Rain is a satisfying step forward for one of the genre's most gifted writers.	2005-06-23

Florida Department of Law Enforcement Bill Tasker had a bad experience working with the FBI in last year's Walking Money. His career and reputation, not to mention his life, were nearly ruined by a crooked government agent. <br /> <br />As Shock Wave begins, Tasker is again working with the feds and he's not very happy about it. He doesn't have much choice, though, as he teams up with the G-men in pursuit of a hillbilly arms dealer with a stolen Stinger missile. <br /> <br />The FBI thinks they've got the case all wrapped up, but Tasker isn't sure. Over the objections of the federal agents, he continues to investigate and finds that the intrigue runs much deeper than anyone suspects. <br /> <br />At the center of that mystery is a terrorist bomber planning the biggest \\"event\\" of his life. Somehow, though, he manages to stay just one step ahead of the authorities. Tasker begins to wonder: is the killer that smart of is he just lucky? Or is somebody on the inside helping him? <br /> <br />Aided by his best friend, Miami cop Derrick Sutter, and ATF agent Camy Parks, Tasker has to catch the bomber before time runs out. If they fail, numerous lives will be lost, possibly including their own. <br /> <br />In the character of Bill Tasker, Born has created a winning protagonist. A dedicated cop and committed father, Tasker struggles to balance the demands of his job with his obligations to his family. Like the rest of us, he doesn't always make the right choices, but his heart is in the right place and he earns our respect for his efforts. <br /> <br />The plot of Shock Wave is tremendously entertaining, combining edge-of-your-seat action and suspense, an intriguing game of cat and mouse, and occasional passages of laugh-out-loud humor. <br /> <br />After a career in law enforcement stretching nearly two decades, James O. Born knows the way cops think, act and talk, and he draws on that experience to write with the insight and authenticity that few authors can match. <br /><br />That expert knowledge wouldn't be enough, though, to create such a winning book. Doing that takes serious writing chops, the kind of ability that most folks can't muster. Born is the exception, though. With both street cred and talent to spare, he is ideally positioned to write top-notch crime fiction, something which Walking Money promised and Shock Wave confirmed. <br /> <br />James O. Born is the best thing to happen to Florida crime writing since Elmore Leonard hit the Sunshine State. This guy is the real deal.	2005-04-27

I read through most of his latest thriller in just two days, but was unable to quite get to the end before it was time for bed. I should have just powered through and finished it, since I was up half the night anyway thinking about the story and anticipating the last eighty pages. <br /> <br />When I finished it the next morning, I breathed a sigh of relief and sat back in awe, thinking of the incredible journey I'd just been on. Like a great roller coaster ride, it was riveting and fun and I couldn't wait for it to end - if for no other reason than so I could think about doing it again very soon. <br /> <br />\\"Company Man\\" is everything a thriller should be: suspenseful, unsettling, tense, exciting, enthralling, entertaining, and, above all, thrilling.

Rachel Lopez is a probation officer, a hard woman with a drinking problem, who nevertheless shows compassion and empathy for the ex-cons she is charged with minding.    Lorenzo Brown, one of Lopez's clients, is trying to leave his drug-ridden past behind him, pouring himself into this job as an animal control officer. He is a strong and convincing character, and his interactions with Lopez are beautifully written and nuanced.    With a smaller scope than some of his previous books, Drama City works on a more personal level. Its story of the troubled lives of ordinary people is moving and effective. Watching these basically good people trying their best to succeed in a difficult environment makes for a very compelling story.    Readers who are already fans of Pelecanos will find this to be yet another entertaining novel in what is developing into a remarkable career. Those who have not yet had the chance to read his books are in store for an excellent, accessible introduction to the work of one of America's finest novelists.	2005-03-28

He's a good man, a devoted father and husband, a successful businessman. Like the rest of us, he's got his share of pain, but he's not a dark, haunted soul. Even though he runs a wine shop, he only occasionally drinks. <br /> <br />Coleman's writing is sparse and direct, with great characters and excellent use of setting. There are moments in the book that are very funny, elements of fine suspense, and turns that are touching and even sad. <br /> <br />Don't miss this wonderful book from a writer who deserves much more attention than he's getting.	2005-03-11

Of course, they usually don't. Most of the time they just end up causing him trouble. <br /> <br />Del is trying to get the goods on an organized crime group known as \\"The Association,\\" but the harder he digs, the less he seems to know. The souls he keeps stashed away in his mind (in a place he calls the \\"Brain Hotel\\") are no help either, not even those of the former FBI agent or the mob hit man. <br /> <br />If you're starting to suspect that Secret Dead Men is not the ordinary mystery novel, you're right. It is offbeat, quirky and confident, revealing Swierczynski as a talented newcomer.	2005-02-21

The best of his work has been the 16-volume Matt Scudder series. <br /> <br />Scudder is a former NYPD detective who hung up his shield and climbed into a bottle years ago. Now sober and mostly retired from the private investigator business, he is content to live a quiet life with the woman he loves and leave the violence of his past far behind. <br /> <br />\\"All the Flowers are Dying,\\" the latest in the series, opens on the eve of an execution. Despite all evidence to the contrary, the man on death row protests he did not commit three murders. The only one who believes him is a psychologist who meets with the condemned man before witnessing his death by lethal injection. <br /> <br />At the same time, Scudder agrees to help out a friend by checking out a man she has met through an online dating service. He could be Mr. Right, but he seems to have secrets in his life that trouble her. As Scudder finds out, he has good reason to keep some things hidden. <br /> <br />Block's extraordinary skill as a writer is evident in the way he brings together the different parts of his plot into one electrifying whole. He spins his story with such cunning ability that you can't help being drawn into his web. <br /> <br />The suspense in \\"All the Flowers Are Dying\\" is acute enough to make you hold your breath. Combine that with a hero for the ages and a villain to match, and Block has given us yet another triumphant entry in this fine and memorable series.	2005-02-15

This time it's the murder of a Japanese-American whose death seems to have something to do with a missing inka, a traditional Japanese scroll indicating accomplishment or enlightenment. <br /> <br />At the behest of his sensei (teacher), Burke also becomes involved with a lama who has fled oppression in his native Tibet but is still in danger. Is it possible that the two cases are related? <br /> <br />Although the publisher of Deshi (Japanese for student) bills the novel as a \\"martial arts thriller,\\" it is much more than that. True, it has its share of action and suspense, but Donohue's story is also one of insight and reflection, written by an author who understands the dichotomy between East and West and uses that knowledge to flavor his already compelling prose.	2005-02-15

Russell Cruz-Price is disillusioned with his career as a journalist and has embarked on a mad quest to recover a fabled Mayan artifact, the Red Jaguar, which he hopes will bring him the riches he so desperately desires. <br /> <br />Harrington's book will draw natural comparisons to the work of Graham Greene, particularly The Heart of the Matter and The Quiet American. Those comparisons to one of literature's master craftsmen will be well deserved. <br /> <br />With a strong narrative voice, fascinating plot, and sharply drawn characters, Red Jungle is powerful and compelling.

Some of them are terrific (like his first book of 2003, The Face), some are more ordinary.  Odd Thomas, fortunately, is solidly in the former category. <br /> <br />If you've seen the film The Sixth Sense, you'll be familiar with the setup for the plot of Odd Thomas.  Yes, the oddly-named Odd sees dead people.  He also sees evil spirits, the presence of which alerts him to a terrible event that is going to happen. <br /> <br />Although it starts out in familiar fashion, Koontz is a gifted enough storyteller that he soon makes you forget the movie and just enjoy his story.  Taut and suspenseful, Odd Thomas is the type of book that Koontz made his bones with and it will be very welcome to fans new and old alike. <br /> <br />Odd Thomas is one of the best books of the year, a moving and gripping story that is powerful enough to take your breath away.

That theft sets off a chain reaction resulting in a wave of violence and hilarity that sweeps across Albuquerque like Patton through the Germans. <br /> <br />Like Elmore Leonard, the writer whose work his most resembles, Brewer writes with a light and deft touch, bringing style and wit to the crime genre, along with a pleasing gift for character and dialogue.	2004-12-17

Ace Atkins proves with Dirty South he is one of the latter. <br /> <br />His latest book reads like a blues song brought to life. Moving to a lush, languid beat, it is a raw but fluid journey through the streets of New Orleans and the often troubled lives of his characters. <br /> <br />Of all the day jobs amateur detectives pursue, Nick Travers has perhaps the coolest of all: blues tracker. A former football player now a college professor, Travers spends his time tracking down the dying legends of the blues and recording their artists' stories as part of an oral history project. <br /> <br />All Nick is trying to do this time is help an old teammate who's in some serious money trouble, but he finds himself up to his ankles in alligators, fighting to save both himself and his friend. <br /> <br />Atkins has increased the energy of his plotting in Dirty South, taking Travers on a thrill ride through the ghettos of the Big Easy to the bayous of rural Louisiana.

Things become even more complicated for her when she discovers that her last, ill-advised fling with her husband has resulted in an unexpected pregnancy. <br /> <br />Were it not for the tender relationship she forms with Sam Morgan, her new friend and employer, Annie would probably fall apart. This is especially true once the mystery of the plot unfolds. It involves her ex-husband, a shady lawyer and a missing masterpiece of art. <br /> <br />Hyzy's work is tentative at points and the suspense of her story is never as tightly wound as it might be, but the real draw here is the finely crafted characters and the interactions between them.

Schutz has made a welcome return with a powerful, emotionally charged work that will reintroduce his name to the minds of eager readers.    The Mongol Reply centers on a nasty custody dispute between a disturbed young woman and her allegedly violent husband, a former football star. In order to keep custody of her children, she must demonstrate her fitness to Dr. Morgan Reece, a child psychology specialist assigned to her case by the court.    Dr. Reece is an intriguing character, as are all of Schutz's creations. He is a man with a troubled and painful past that he must wade through while trying to help the poor children trapped between their warring parents.    The Mongol Reply is a fascinating exploration of just how bad a bad custody battle can be. At times it is almost painful to read, as Schutz shows how the system can devastate the lives of the meek and innocent.    Combining the elements of both a legal thriller and a psychological one, The Mongol Reply is an enthralling and challenging book that will please fans old and new.

Ford's third book featuring Frank Corso, a disgraced New York Times reporter turned best-selling author of true-crime novels. (Maybe that's a career Jayson Blair should consider.) <br /> <br />As the book opens, Corso and his assistant (and former lover), Meg Dougherty, are on the lam, hiding from a Texas grand jury that wants to ask Corso questions he doesn't have good answers for. In their effort to escape, the pair winds up in a remote location in snowy Wisconsin, where they stumble upon a grisly crime scene. <br /> <br />That discovery leads them onto the trail of a twisted serial killer who preys on entire families, including her own. Don't worry, though; this isn't another lame, exploitive manic-killer book that uses its crimes to titillate. Ford is too classy an author for that. True, the villain is one sick woman, but she's largely in the background while the focus of the story is on Corso. <br /> <br />A Blind Eye is an excellent example of a well written crime novel that tells a straightforward, interesting story without pretensions or cliche. At times it goes off in unnecessary directions (like the killing of a deputy that made no sense at all), but that weakness is a minor one. The gripping suspense and stunning climax make this book well worthwhile.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, Chicago Sun-Times	2004-10-20

His assignment: Eliminate Achille Belghazi, a French-Arab arms dealer who is known for supplying several Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian terror groups. <br /> <br />What was supposed to be a simple job, however, turns out to be much more complicated. Belghazi proves easy enough to get close to, but removing him without leaving any evidence behind is far tougher. One of the reasons Rain is the best at what he does is his mastery of the \\"natural causes\\" hit: When Rain kills you, nobody even suspects you were murdered. <br /> <br />It is testimony to Eisler's skills that he has created a protagonist who might otherwise be repugnant and made him into a fascinating character with real depth, an intriguing, troubling man, made different from the rest of us by his unique and horrible skills. <br /> <br />So much about Rain Storm recommends it: exotic settings, gripping suspense, thrilling fight scenes and a stellar supporting cast, along with one of the most compelling lead characters in the genre.

Tracy (the pseudonymous identity of a mother-daughter writing team) wrote one of the best debut mysteries of 2003, the Gumshoe Award-winning Monkeewrench. Now she has written a sequel, Live Bait, and it is another polished and intriguing story. <br /> <br />Like John Sandford, the superb crime writer whose work hers most resembles, Tracy uses the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul as the setting for her stories. That frigid Midwestern location makes a perfect backdrop for her suspenseful and witty stories of cops and killers.  <br /> <br />Several elderly people in the city have been the victims of violent attacks, and the pressure on the police to solve the crimes is intense.  <br /> <br />Live Bait has a complex and interesting plot, and the lead characters are nicely done. Unfortunately the secondary characters who were used to such great effect in Monkeewrench hardly appear in this one, but that is only a minor detraction.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, Chicago Sun-Times	2004-07-23

He's even become involved with a woman and things look promising. <br /> <br />All of that begins to unravel when a romantic dinner is interrupted by a puzzling old man who informs the startled couple that he knows a secret from their past. His bizarre revelation would have been easy enough to ignore -- had he not been found dead later that night. <br /> <br />Hamilton is one of the best in the business at using a keen sense of place as the foundation for his stories. The feeling of isolation, loneliness and bitter cold in the North Woods that fills his books makes them stand out from otherwise similar novels in the crime fiction genre. <br /> <br />Focusing on the domestic side of McKnight's life is a departure for the series, and there are times when it works less well that we've come to expect from Hamilton. The mystery of Ice Run never rises to the level of intrigue that one might hope, and the sense of jeopardy is not as keenly felt. <br /> <br />Those are minor quibbles, however, when a writer has the talent that this one does. With such fine use of setting and memorable characters, Ice Run is a journey you will want to take.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, Chicago Sun-Times	2004-07-23

Clare Fergusson, an Episcopal priest, and her good friend, Chief of Police Russ Van Alstyne. <br /> <br />As with the first two books in the series (all three named after hymns), Out of the Deep contains an absorbing plot, with all the necessary touches of intrigue and suspense. This is the author's best story yet, a contemporary mystery with roots in the past, presented with the flair and polish of the finest artisan.  <br /> <br />Even better than the plots, though, are the wonderful characters Spencer-Fleming creates. The relationship between her two main players, especially, is so touching and authentic that the ending is enough to make even the hardest heart melt. <br /> <br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, Chicago Sun-Times	2004-07-23

When the producer is found dead floating his pool, the list of suspects seems to include just about everyone in Hollywood, including Hayes.  <br /> <br />Hayes sets out to find the killer himself, along the way encountering a rogue's gallery of showbiz malcontents that will have readers shaking their heads in disbelief, all the while laughing out loud.  <br /> <br />Earthquake Weather is the best Hollywood novel since Michael Tolkin's The Player -- and a fine crime story besides. <br /> <br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, Chicago Sun-Times	2004-07-23

Tess Monaghan. Her latest book is likely to change that. Every Secret Thing is one of those books that publishers like to say \\"transcends the genre,\\" but in this case it's true.<br />It has been seven years since Olivia Barnes, a baby from a prominent Baltimore African-American family, disappeared. Her killers, two 11-year-old white girls, have only recently been released from prison when children again start to disappear.<br />Cynthia Barnes, the slain child's mother, is certain that the pair is at it again, and the police aren't far behind. But which of the teens is responsible? Is it good girl Alice or bad girl Ronnie? Or is it another killer altogether?<br />Every Secret Thing deals with difficult subject matter, portraying children as both victims and perpetrators of the worst kind of violence. Lippman, however, writes with such a deft touch and with such keen insight that her story is never exploitative or crass.<br />Whether it is driven by Lippman's feminine sensitivity, her skills as a writer, or both, one thing is certain: Every Secret Thing will stay with you for a long time.<br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, Chicago Sun-Times	2004-07-18

The basic plot, involving a Mobile (Ala.) detective pursuing a murderer who decapitates his victims, is familiar. What's different is that the cop's brother is a psychotic killer himself, albeit an imprisoned one.<br />Detective Carson Ryder uses his brother as his personal Hannibal Lecter, quizzing his insane sibling about the murders, and using the clues he doles out to pursue the investigation.<br />It's a refreshing change to read a crime novel whose protagonist isn't all-knowing, ready to solve every mystery with incredible intelligence and Holmes-like powers of deduction. The fact that the detective needs help, even if it is from a murderer, makes a nice addition to the story.<br />Kerley may not yet be the master of the genre that Thomas Harris is, but he's gotten off to a great start.

Now Lynds has stepped out of the master's shadow with a rousing new work that will earn a prominent place on every thriller lover's bookshelf.<br />The Coil features the return of Liz Sansborough (who first appeared in Masquerade in 1995), a former CIA covert operative whose hatred of violence caused her to abandon that life and flee to California to live a quiet existence as a college professor.<br />But she can never leave her former life completely behind. Powerful groups believe Sansborough possesses vital information -- the kind of intelligence that can bring down governments -- and they will do anything to obtain that knowledge.<br />As one of the few writers who combines an uncommon knowledge of the covert world with a craftsman's skill at thriller writing, Lynds knows the genre as well as anyone who has ever worked in it. In this book she brings all her expertise to bear.<br />With a panoramic backdrop of exotic European locales, breakneck pacing, a tough and brainy protagonist, and vicious villains, The Coil has all of the pieces in place to make it spellbinding.<br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, Chicago Sun-Times	2004-07-10

He's also determined to once and for all help his wayward son escape from the perpetual mess of a life that he has gotten himself into.<br />Swain's knowledge is so comprehensive that it alone would be enough to make his books interesting to read.

Our hearts ache for this devastated father, not just because of the drama of his plight, but also for his quiet desperation and persistence. <br />Mooney's work is dark and desperate, but filled with genuine human emotion, sympathetic characters and intriguing plots.

With her third book, Last Lullaby, she once again confirms that promise with a gripping, action-packed work that ought to bring her books to a much wider audience. <br />After two fascinating explorations of L.A.'s ethnic subcultures, this time Hamilton has produced a more conventionally directed mystery that is focused on an intense story about child abductions and the underground market for overseas adoptions. <br />As with the author's first two novels, Los Angeles Times reporter Eve Diamond pursues the investigation and her own conflicted emotions about motherhood, as well as her concern for a lost child, drawing her deep into a dangerous situation. <br />Diamond is one of the best characters in a currently ongoing series. She is sympathetic and believable, and generally acts with intelligence and reason, qualities unfortunately rare in the modern mystery. She also has the right mix of street smarts, sass and vulnerability to draw the reader's interest and concern.<br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, Chicago Sun-Times	2004-06-29

They will be swept away by the story, just as the story's hero is by one of the city's aqueducts (the &quot;narrows&quot; of the book's title).<br />In some ways, The Narrows is like a &quot;greatest hits&quot; volume for Connelly, as it brings back several of the faces who appeared in his earlier works. Because of that, it will probably appeal most to fans that have already read those books.<br />Even a reader who is coming to Connelly for the first time, though, will still find a lot to enjoy here.<br />The Narrows is crime fiction at its best.<br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, Mystery Ink	2004-06-29

The Enemy is a prequel to the rest of the series, flashing back to Reacher's army days in the early 90s.<br />As the book opens, Reacher has been transferred to a base in North Carolina where he is placed in charge of the installation's policing operations. It promises to be another dull, routine assignment -- at least until a high-ranking office turns up dead in a fleabag motel room just off-base.<br />What follows is a terrific military police procedural that finds Reacher pursuing the case -- and its cover-up -- across the country and even overseas to Europe. By doing so he places not only his career, but also his life in jeopardy.<br />Reacher remains one of the most intriguing characters in the genre, a complex loner who mixes brains and brawn in equal measure. He might not be the most realistic creation, but he never fails to be fascinating.<br />If you've never read Lee Child before, The Enemy makes an excellent place to start.

The author has brought back hard-bitten Brooklyn Assistant District Attorney Andrew Giobberti for another go-around on the borough's mean streets and in its grim halls of justice.<br />A bodega owner has been murdered in what seems to be an open-and-shut case. As Gio digs deeper, though, he senses that something is rotten underneath the surface. There's a reason he was assigned to this murder and, once he learns it, his outrage leads him to take on his corrupt bosses.<br />There are times when Semiautomatic suffers from an excess of personality, with machinegun sentences and clipped dialogue assaulting readers so fast they hardly have a chance to catch their breath. That is also part of the book's charm, though, as Reuland breaks out of the typical urban crime mold with his fresh, compelling protagonist and idiosyncratic style.<br />Semiautomatic is recommended to anyone who is tired of the usual, run-of-the-mill legal thriller and wants to read something that tells it a little more like it really is.<br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, Chicago Sun-Times	2004-06-26

Konrath has leapt onto the mystery scene with a first novel that is so good, so entertaining, that it's hard to believe that we haven't heard from him before now. Whiskey Sour introduces readers to Lt. Jack Daniels, one of the Chicago Police Department's best officers, a woman with the steely toughness to match her unconventional name. Daniels is assigned to investigate a series of grisly killings, each one worse than the last.<br />Konrath expertly cuts between Daniels' first-person narrative with the killer's own story, a device that is often over-used in the mystery genre, but is handled very well in this case. He has an excellent sense of both pacing and character, each of which contributes to make this book so good.<br />The serial killer subgenre has been all but done to death, but the author wisely puts his own stamp on the story, injecting a darkly comic sense of humor into the proceedings that will have readers chuckling even as they wince.<br />Combining the best qualities of John Sandford and Janet Evanovich into one sleek and enjoyable package, Whiskey Sour is the best debut of the year so far.<br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, Chicago Sun-Times	2004-06-26

She is exiled to the Left Coast and a friend sets her up in a ramshackle antiques shop on the Monterey Peninsula.<br />Doyle is an appealing protagonist, a mixture of anger, savvy and vulnerability. She also seems authentic, the kind of character you could actually know and like. She is a strong woman who can handle herself but never seems like a feminine man, which unfortunately happens with too many female mystery characters.<br />The well-crafted plot revolves around three sins: murder, fraud and greed.

When she's discovered the next morning by her cleaning man, the police are quick to settle on John Blair Creighton, a largely unsuccessful mid-list writer, as the likely culprit. (The suspect's profession, not incidentally, allows the author an opportunity to deliciously skewer the venality of the publishing industry.) While true that he did meet her and apparently go home with her, Creighton certainly doesn't remember killing her. Of course, he was very drunk at the time and might have blacked out.<br />Even with Creighton under arrest, however, the killings don't stop. Next to come is a brutal triple murder in a whorehouse, followed by the firebombing of a gay bar. Soon another suspect appears, a bland, ordinary insurance executive who lost everything that mattered to him on 9/11, including, it seems, his very soul.<br />The 2001 terrorist attack on New York City forms an ever-present backdrop to the conjoined stories of Small Town. The many characters that populate it are still reeling from the loss, trying to make sense out of a world gone mad, always reminded by the stark hole in their beautiful skyline. Their pain, the city's pain, is an important of their lives still, and thus an important part of the plot.<br />Block has written a masterpiece for his 52nd novel, a stunning work that draws on all his powers as a storyteller and chronicler of the darker side of the human psyche. Never before has he painted on such a broad canvas, and never before has he attempted to go so deep into the hearts and minds of so many different characters. Breaking out of the more traditional mystery mold was a gamble, but it has paid off in spades. Small Town is one of the finest books of Block's, or any, career.<br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, Mystery Ink	2003-01-22

He even hooks up with a made guy who wants Mickey to lay off some bets for him.

The fourth outing for Dr. Sylvia Strange  is the best one yet. Although the plot of &quot;Dantes' Inferno&quot; might seem familiar, there is enough that is new to keep the reader interested. John Dantes is a particularly interesting villain, both for his brilliance and his passivity. We're never quite sure what he's up to, if anything. Watching him match wits with Sylvia makes for excellent reading. <br />Unlike most thrillers, this is an intelligent book, interweaving an above-average plot with an allegorical depiction of Los Angeles as Dante's (note the similarity to Dantes) nine-circled Hell. Throw in the psychological study of &quot;Dantes' Inferno's&quot; twisted bad guys and it's clear that author Lovett is one smart lady.

His goal is to create a supercomputer the size of a dime (hence the book's title) - and he's about to make a huge breakthrough that will advance the state of the art a long way towards that end.<br />Pierce is distracted, though, by his personal life. He's just broken up with the woman he loved and moved into a new apartment when he starts getting strange phone calls. Apparently the previous owner of the number was a very popular \\"escort\\" with a large client list. A visit to her website reveals that Lilly was a stunningly attractive woman and Henry finds himself more than a little interested in her. He can't help but wonder where she's gone. As he begins to pluck at the knot of her apparent disappearance, a complicated plot - along with Henry's life - begins to unravel.<br />\\"Chasing the Dime\\" is something of a departure for Connelly, taking the reader not just away from the ongoing life of detective Harry Bosch, but also away from the gritty, noir world that most of his work inhabits. The emphasis in this book is less on the physical and more on the mental. Pierce is a brilliant man and he brings his considerable analytical skills as a scientist to bear in figuring out what is happening. <br />Although \\"Chasing\\" may not have the sheer intensity or moral poignancy of the best of Connelly's mysteries, it is still the kind of thriller that keeps your interest piqued, keeps the pages turning, and pays off with a satisfying conclusion.	2002-10-16

With a few curious questions, D'Amato finds they all have something in common: Omnin, the new antibiotic prescribed by their physicians to combat the flu.<br />The secondary story of the homicide investigation is disjointed from the main plot line. What the characters forget seems to have little relevance to the investigation, though author Levinson tries to force it anyway. Almost from the onset, D'Amato's character believes the memory loss phenomenon is related to the Riverside stranglings, and so Levinson sets out to prove it. Unfortunately, he fails to make the connection. Even at his finest moments, it is quite a stretch to see the effects on Omnin in the murder investigation. It is sheer coincidence that the people his detective queries in his memory investigation end up being criminally involved in the killings. <br />The discussion of how the human brain relates to memory and how memory affects history was as close as Levinson got to intriguing. The medical aspects and police investigation were definitely lacking. His writing style is flat and the plot has too many weaknesses to be enticing. The climax is anything but climactic and the story just winds down to a conveniently opportune ending. Perhaps Levinson fell victim to his fictional adversary-memory loss-as this book is anything but memorable.<br />Reviewed by Maili Montgomery, Mystery Ink	2002-10-14

In this excellent follow up to Alex Kava's debut novel, \\"A Perfect Evil,\\" FBI profiler Maggie O'Dell is again haunted (and hunted) by her crazed nemesis, Albert Stucky.  O'Dell and Stucky have a sordid history together, as O'Dell spent two years studying the gory bodies and crime scenes left behind by Stucky, each one drawing her closer to him.  His eventual arrest nearly cost O'Dell her life and has left her with deep physical and emotional scars.  Now that he has escaped from prison, O'Dell is obsessed with stopping him and is convinced she has the best shot at succeeding.  <br />Author Kava does an excellent job of weaving emotional development into this fast-paced, suspenseful pursuit of evil.  Maggie O'Dell is a fascinating character, remaining strong and resourcesful while going through turmoil in both her personal and professional lives.  She is only able to do this through the faith and support of her friends.  Encounters with these supporting characters provide a glimpse into the life of the real Maggie O'Dell, the one behind the tough exterior she presents in her professional life.  All the while, Maggie's character is both credible and likable.<br />Kava's writing is reminiscent of Patricia Cornwell's in her prime. Like many fans of Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series who have been disappointed with the last couple of books, I have been searching for something similar in the suspense genre.  Well, search no more. Kava picks up where Cornwell took a wrong turn, creating a fascinating character in Maggie O'Dell.  Give Alex Kava a \\"Split Second\\" to win you over; you won't be disappointed.<br />Reviewed by Maili Montgomery, Mystery Ink	2002-09-26

The story begins with John Rain, a highly paid hit man, tracking his prey through the byzantine streets and subways of Tokyo. His unknown paymasters have ordered the elimination of a highly-ranked member of the government bureaucracy. The high-tech hit man carries out his assignment with emotionless precision, daring, and inventiveness that can't help but draw the reader quickly in to this unusual man's world.<br />That death, however, sets off a chain reaction that forces Rain to flee his comfortable, orderly world, and battle the ghosts of his past. He must fight not only to stay alive, but to earn the love of a beautiful and talented young artist - a woman who just happens to be the daughter of his recent target.<br />For a first novel in particular, \\"Rain Fall\\" is written with a firm and confident hand. The story's intriguing plot moves forward at a driving pace, but the author still has the skill and foresight to include some rich characterizations, along with enough of the right kind of details to make his writing authentic and engrossing.<br />There is much to recommend about this book, not the least its compelling protagonist. John Rain is a remarkable creation, a multifaceted killer with the soul of a poet. He is easily one of the most interesting characters to come along in some time. One can only hope that Eisler is already hard at work on his return. \\"Rain Fall\\" is a tremendous debut, the best to come out so far this year.<br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, Mystery Ink	2002-08-25

Garth Carson is an ordinary guy with an unordinary interest in dead animals (he bills himself as a &quot;Renter, Procurer, Broker and Vendor of Taxidermy&quot;). He's minding his own business while hunting an &quot;antiques&quot; shop one day when he spots the Maltese Falcon of stuffed animals: Pipsqueak the Nutty Nut. This puppet made from a real squirrel's skin was a prominent fixture on the young Garth's favorite low-budget local television program: The General Buster Show.<br />Summarizing the story is no small task, as it is a complicated one, involving zoot suiters, tuning forks, swing dancers, mind control, and a whole host of bizarre miscellanea. If at times a bit over-complicated, the plot doesn't matter that much anyway. The Pipsqueak puppet is only a MacGuffin, a largely meaningless device to further the story, not to matter in and of itself. The real meat of the book is the quirky characters and their interplay, along with the protagonist's wry observations on life.<br />It's hard to imagine anyone whose work Wiprud's is similar to. His twisted sense of humor and fascination for odd minutiae are fairly unique. Admirers of Donald Westlake and Elmore Leonard, especially, though, will find much here to enjoy. Wiprud is definitely a writer to watch.<br />Reviewed by David Montgomer, Mystery Ink	2002-08-19

Fans of Block's series characters will find plenty to enjoy here, including nine Matt Scudder stories, three featuring burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr, and five with hit man Keller. They have all appeared elsewhere at one time or another, but unless you're a Block completist, you're unlikely to have seen several of them before. Even if you have read some of them, this book is still an invaluable addition to your collection, as it includes all of the stories and presents them in chronological order, something impossible to find prior to this.<br />Perhaps the best thing about &quot;Enough Rope,&quot; though, is the inclusion of a dozen new works, most of them fairly lengthy for short stories, all of them superbly crafted and delightful little reads. A few in particular, like &quot;Almost Perfect&quot; (about a murderous baseball game) and &quot;Points&quot; (about a father and son) stand out for their quality and inventiveness.  Even after half a decade of writing short fiction, Block is still trying, and succeeding at, new things. (For historical value, if nothing else, the author's first published story is included as well.)<br />&quot;Enough Rope&quot; is a hefty book, containing eighty-three stories that run almost 900 pages. That represents virtually every published story by this prolific writer. It is a testimony to the popularity of Block and the quality of his writing that his publisher would take such a gamble and produce such a large, handsome volume. &quot;Enough Rope&quot; is a real treat.<br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, MysteryInkOnline.com	2002-08-11

Easy has settled down, living with the woman he loves and his two adopted children, and making a comfortable living as a custodian at the Sojourner Truth Middle School. He doesn't need to do \\"favors\\" for friends from L.A.'s South Central community like he once did. But old habits are the hardest to break, and when his pal John comes to him for help, Easy can't resist.<br />John's stepson Brawly has gotten mixed up with a group of radical black activists who are determined to foment revolution - or maybe they're a gang of common criminals looking to make a big score. Either way, Easy knows the territory better than anybody else and is just the man to find out what's going on.<br />Mosley's books have never relied solely on their plots, as the main attraction has always been the sense of time, place, and character which the author so brilliantly weaves. In that sense, this book is no different. Even if the new, domesticated Easy isn't nearly as interesting as the old one - a point which isn't helped any by the absence of his old friend and partner, the murderous Mouse - he still remains a man who draws our fascination like few fictional creations can. Part of the allure of this series has always been the chance to view a troubled, ever-changing America through the eyes of this flawed, but noble black man. Even if the mystery of \\"Bad Boy Brawly Brown\\" fails to pique the reader's interest, it is still recommended as a social and historical gem.<br />Reviewed by David Montgomery...	2002-07-16

Unable to get over causing the death of one so young, Freeman retired from the force and moved south to Florida, taking up residence in an abandoned shack on the edge of the Everglades.<br />Max is trying to lose the demons that plague him and regain some semblance of a healthy psyche, but that hope is shattered when he discovers the body of a young girl wrapped in cloth and dumped in his river.<br />Debut author Jonathon King is a veteran journalist, having written for newspapers in both Philadelphia and Florida, so he definitely knows the territory. As is common in the books of fellow Florida writer and newspaperman Carl Hiaasen, the lush, varied environment of the state is a prominent fixture in \\"The Blue Edge of Midnight,\\" as is the danger that lies in the destruction of that environment. <br />\\"The Blue Edge of Midnight\\" is the best debut mystery of 2002 so far...	2002-04-05

Joe Petrone is the local wiseguy and, according to wife #3, he has about as much loyalty to his betrotheds as did King Henry VIII.  He's making noises like he's tired of her, and she wants Private Eye Dwight Van Savage to make sure she doesn't \\"accidentally\\" drive off a cliff or fall asleep in the bathtub.<br />\\"Ike\\" Van Savage makes for a good character because he's ordinary enough to earn the reader's trust and sympathy, just noble enough to keep going despite the odds stacked against him, and just dangerous enough to keep things interesting.  Beyond all that, he seemed to be a good guy and a loving father.  His scenes with his nine-year old daughter are both sweet and realistic, without being cloying.  Ike may be hard-boiled on his surface, but his interior is warmer than Marlowe's every was.<br />Author Jack Kelly has not only created a likeable protagonist, but he has placed him in a fruitful setting as well.  It's nice to read something a little off the beaten path, and Rochester seems like as good a place as easy to have a shot and a beer, and get beaten over the head.  His evocation of 1950s America is excellent, with all the details down pat, from the cars and the clothes, to the smells in the air.<br />Highly recommended...	2002-03-21

The wealthy husband of a extremely stupid woman dies mysteriously and she's the only obvious suspect -- but is she smart enough to have done it?  Spenser is hired to find out the truth and uncovers a scheme involving blackmail, fraud, and deceit. <br />Spenser has gotten older over the years, a fairly uncommon thing for a series star.  (Most of them, it seems, age about as fast as a giant redwood.)  It hasn't really slowed him down any; he's still pretty fast with his fists for a guy who must be close to seventy.  His near-senior status is reflected, though, is his calm, even dull relationship with his long-time flame Susan.  There used to be real spark between those two, but that fire burned out long ago.<br />Better, as always, is Spenser's relationship with his trusty outlaw partner Hawk.  Hawk was the original psychotic sidekick with a heart of gold, and he remains one of the best of the lot.  He doesn't have much to do this time out, other than follow Spenser around and make sure nobody kills him, but it's still nice to see what he's up to.<br />\\"Widow's Walk\\" doesn't match up to the best books of the series,... but it provides a pleasant diversion.<br />Reviewed by David Montgomery...	2002-03-18

Derek Strange and Terry Quinn, the salt and pepper detective team first introduced in \\"Right as Rain\\" (2000), are back in another stellar mystery from one of the very best writers of contemporary fiction. Forget about the milquetoast scribblers who pop up on Oprah; authors like Pelecanos are where the quality really is.<br />In the hands of a less-skilled writer, this unlikely duo would seem forced and false, an interracial pair thrown together because it's contemporary and PC. Pelecanos couldn't care less about that, though. Strange and Quinn are together because it works; their skills and personalities not only complement each other, their pairing allows them to access both sides of D.C.'s color divide. Even more than that, these two very different men have gradually, reluctantly formed a real friendship.<br />Pelecanos does so many things well in his books. The action, the suspense, the dialogue are all breathtakingly sharp. He even provides the soundtrack to his story, music selected to demonstrate his characters moods and attitudes.<br />It's amazing to me that Pelecanos isn't a bigger name in the mystery field than he is.

This time out the author heads for the Deep South, probing the dirty doings in the Delta Blues area of Mississippi. With casinos comes corruption, and Tunica, Miss. has its share of both -- thus giving Leonard an excellent setting to work his magic.<br />Dennis Lenahan is a high diver, one of those daredevils who jumps off an eighty foot tower into a plastic swimming pool with a foot of water in it. As you'd expect, he's one cool customer. Cooler still is his new friend Robert Taylor, a jive-talking gangster from De-troit who's gone down South to run a con based on a hundred-year-old postcard of a lynching -- or so he says, anyway.<br />As you'd expect from Leonard, the wit is sharp, the characters are delightfully bent, and the dialogue is honed to a razor's edge. Robert is one of the author's best creations, his sporty Jag and penchant for the Blues tasty accents to his wise patter.<br />The plot of \\"Tishomingo Blues,\\" though, lacks the mystery and intrigue of a typical Leonard novel. Most of the time this reads more like a Carl Hiaasen \\"buncha whackos\\" story than the crime gems that we've come to expect from Dutch.<br />Even if the plot isn't his best, however, all the other Leonard elements are in place, and that makes \\"Tishomingo Blues\\" a book well worth reading. <br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, MysteryInkOnline.com	2002-01-29

The first original novel ever published by Vintage Crime/Black Lizard (probably best known for reprinting Jim Thompson's books ) is this crackling noir thriller about a computer salesman with an unhappy marriage whose life starts to go down the toilet. Richie Segal's wife threatens to leave him, he might lose his job; even worse, events from his past keep haunting him. He starts to lose his grip. Finally, he decides to take decisive action to put things right. Naturally, that is when his trouble really begins.<br />The first two-thirds of the book, in particular, are excellent; crisp prose, interesting characters (especially the protagonist), and an excellent set-up that had me thirsting to see what happened next. Starr has a keen eye for the vagaries, quirks, and tensions of ordinary, humdrum life. The tension is all the better because we don't know what this boring salesman might do. Unfortunately, though, the pay-off was something of a let-down. The story is really rolling when the author basically cuts things off and ends the book with a surprise, not-very-satisfying climax, with essentially no resolution. It seemed as if there must be fifty pages missing from this book which develop the ending into a more meaningful conclusion.<br />These problems do not spoil &quot;Hard Feelings,&quot; but they do turn it from a potentially great book into only a very good one. Jim Thompson would have taken a story like this and really put the screws to Richie Segal and his tormentors, raising the tension and suspense closer to a hardboiled ideal. I still recommend &quot;Hard Feelings&quot; to you, but next time out I hope that Mr. Starr gives us more.<br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, Mystery Ink	2002-01-11

His mental state isn't helped any when he spots his best friend--supposedly dead for two years--driving next to him on an LA freeway.<br />Detective Scully starts to dig and finds that his friend, along with five other not-so-dead officers, has gone deep undercover. The exact reason, and whether or not their actions are official, remains to be seen. What is immediately clear, though, is that this group of rogue officers (they call themselves &quot;the Vikings&quot;) is going make a lot of trouble for Scully if he tells anyone of their existence.<br />Although some of the plot occasionally strays into silliness, and the prose isn't as polished as one might like, Cannell knows how to keep his audience interested and keep them coming back for more.  As you'd expect from all his years writing cop shows, Cannell knows the territory very well and is skillful and knowledgeable about how the game works.<br />The author also does a good job of probing the shady world of money laundering, and the role of legitimate American corporations in that underworld operation. (Cannell explains in the introduction how he found out about this real-life corruption and it definitely makes you think.)<br />&quot;The Viking Funeral&quot; is a book that is meant to be read quickly and then largely forgotten; the literary equivalent of one of Cannell's TV shows.

The small, nude body of a young girl is found one wintry night in New York City's Central Park.  Her feet are cut and bloody and she is curled in a fetal position.  It looks as if she ran as far as she could before collapsing in exhaustion, finally giving in to the bitter cold. Any cop would be troubled by Little Girl Blue, but Lieutenant Julia Brennan is moved as a mother, as well as an enforcer of the law.  She has a young daughter of her own and cannot escape from the haunting image that pierces her mind.<br />The subtitle of &quot;Little Girl Blue&quot; is &quot;a novel of crime,&quot; a very apt description.  At the heart of this suspenseful, at times painful book are the most despicable of crimes, those committed against children.  Lieutenant Brennan uncovers a child pornography and prostitution ring that lies hidden in the upper reaches of Manhattan society, sheltered for years by the wealth of those who participate in it.  As soon as Brennan gets the scent of these perverted criminals, though, their days are at an end.<br />Although it features troubling subject matter, &quot;Little Girl Blue&quot; is written with such empathy and tactful restraint that it never strays into offense, something authors who have tackled similar stories have failed to do.  It is appropriately tense, especially during the last twenty pages, but the mystery here tacks a backseat to the characters.  The author explores his characters as people who think and feel in realistic ways, not as the cookie cutter puppets lesser writers use to populate their stories.	2001-12-05

Tony Valentine has spent most of his life dealing with creeps, crumbs, crooks, con men, and other assorted low-lifes. First as a cop and now as a freelance investigator, he has used his skill at spotting scams to bust enough grifters to fill a $3.99 buffet. When casino pit bosses find the house getting taken to the cleaners by the best, they know Tony's the man to stop them. <br />&quot;Grift Sense&quot; is James Swain's first novel and it's a winner.  The story is very interesting and unfolds at a well-measured, suspenseful pace. Like Elmore Leonard, Swain has the knack for creating the kind of thugs and larcenous malcontents whom you can't help but be like.<br />This book is supposed to be the first in a series featuring Tony Valentine. I hope the author is already hard at work on the next volume because I'm looking forward to reading more.	2001-11-19

New York's best unlicensed private detective, Matthew Scudder, is back after a three year absence in this very welcome, fifteenth volume in the series. Mystery lovers can only hope that it won't be the last. <br />Scudder might be showing his age (he's now 62!) and slowing down just a little, but his mind and his instincts are as sharp as they've ever been. He needs all of his experience and resources, too, in order to solve a brutal crime that everyone else, including the police, is satisfied to forget. <br />Many authors would be showing their boredom and fatigue with a character after twenty-five years, but such is definitely not the case with Lawrence Block and Matthew Scudder. The series is as fresh, exciting and brilliant as it ever was. Block truly is the master of the detective novel.	2001-11-16

It has been almost a decade since &quot;The Black Echo&quot; was published, introducing mystery readers to one of the best authors (and detectives) to come along in quite some time. During the intervening years, Michael Connelly has gone on to demonstrate that the promise showed in this book was not misleading. He has consistently proved that he is one of the finest writers of detective fiction ever.<br />Before becoming a mystery author, Connelly was a Pulitzer prize-winning reporter for the Los Angeles Times. His experience as a journalist shows in his ability to grab the reader quickly with concise, descriptive prose. Connelly enables you not only to see through the eyes of his detective, but to feel what it's like to be in his skin. When Bosch has nightmares about being back in those Vietnamese tunnels, the author makes sure you smell the sweat.<br />Along with Lawrence Block's Matt Scudder, Harry Bosch is the most intriguing detective in the mystery genre today. Connelly hits all the right notes with his protagonist, striking a fine balance between weary cynicism, vulnerability, and investigative brilliance. He remains endlessly fascinating, never failing to pique the reader's interest in both his professional and personal lives. The whole series (now numbering six volumes) should be read and savored.	2001-11-16

Hired assassins, mob enforcers, elaborate heists, and double crosses are the meat and potatoes of the hard-boiled genre and Stark has served up another feast with &quot;Firebreak.&quot;<br />The books in the Parker series (this is number twenty-four!) are not profound or deep, nor are they meant to be. They are quick and intense reads, filled with a focused, manic energy. Nearly every one of them has been a winner and &quot;Firebreak&quot; is no exception.	2001-11-16

Despite having the perfect name for the job, Jake Diamond isn't a very successful private investigator. He has trouble paying the bills, especially the alimony for his ex-wife -- who happens to be independently wealthy, so it's not as if she needs Jake's five hundred bucks a month. But that's the kind of luck he has.<br />Everything Jake knows about detecting he learned from his mentor Jimmy Pigeon. When Jimmy turns up dead, it's hardly a surprise that Diamond is determined to find out what happened. When Jake starts investigating, the bodies start to pile up, as each link in the chain leads to another murder.<br />At times &quot;Catching Water in a Net&quot; reads more like a hard-boiled pastiche than an original novel. Abramo throws in all the clichéd elements of the private eye story, right down to the bottle of cheap bourbon in Diamond's desk drawer. After he gets those hurdles out of the way, though, the author settles down and tells a serviceable, straight-ahead detective story. <br />Now that Abramo has this throwback novel out of his system, I look forward to what he does next. I think he has the talent to be a good one.	2001-11-15

Now available for the first time in a single volume edition, &quot;The Harry Bosch Novels&quot; brings together the first three mysteries by Michael Connelly, one of the finest writers in the detective genre. If you haven't yet read this terrific series, this book presents the perfect place to begin.<br />These three stories can easily be read one-by-one, or all three in a row. Such is Connelly's skill that readers are unlikely to tire soon of the unfolding story of Detective Harry Bosch. This omnibus volume is a great way to start this series and will help prepare readers for the release of the 7th Bosch novel (coming in early 2002), which promises to be one of the best yet.<br />If you're not reading Michael Connelly, you're missing one of the best authors fiction has to offer.

Most of his clients are the type of athletes who are lucky to get a job as a special teams player on a perennial loser. But Christian Steele is different.<br />Steele is the hottest quarterback prospect to come along since Dan Marino. He's big and white and has an arm like a cannon -- and he's Bolitar's client. Unfortunately, a cloud hangs over Steele due the disappearance (and possible murder) of his fiancée -- who just happens to be the younger sister of Myron's former girlfriend. Sticky, huh. Bolitar believes in his client's innocence, though, and sets out to prove it.<br />Bolitar reminds me a lot of Robert Crais' Elvis Cole, another tough, smart detective who uses wisecracks to cover up his insecurity and sensitivity. Bolitar also has a psychotic teddy bear of a sidekick in the person of Windsor Horne Lockwood III (aka Win), just as Elvis has Joe Pike. More importantly, Coben's series reminds me of Crais' in that both are excellent, funny, and suspenseful reads.<br />I look forward to reading more of Harlan Coben. He's definitely a keeper.<br />Reviewed by David Montgomer, Mystery Ink	2001-11-08

Georgia Skeehan, rookie fire marshal and former NYC firefighter, spearheads an investigation into a series of high-temperature accelerant (HTA) fires that have hit the Big Apple in the past few months. Despite the existence of letters from an ominous, scripture-quoting &quot;fourth angel,&quot; as well as the many similarities between the recent fires, very few in the New York City Fire Department are interested in hearing Skeehan's theory that the fires may be related. Everywhere she digs, however, she finds something that arouses her suspicions and fills her with dread at the truth she might uncover. <br />Georgia Skeehan is a very enjoyable character and will make an excellent protagonist for an ongoing series. She has the warmth and vulnerability to be a likeable heroine, yet also has the grit and tenacity needed not only to survive but to excel in the male-dominated fire department. Reminiscent of Patricia Cornwell's Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Skeehan is a thinking investigator who is nevertheless unafraid to get down and dirty in the heart of her pursuit.<br />&quot;The Fourth Angel&quot; is a very promising debut and is highly recommended.<br />Reviewed by Mystery Ink	2001-10-18

A young girl has gone missing, apparently voluntarily, and her rich, leftie father wants Burke to bring her back. It's the kind of thing he's good at, so it wouldn't prove much of a problem--except other hidden intrigues keep popping up and getting in his way.<br />Vachss' style is a little different from the typical mystery writer's. He writes with an economy of words that makes most hard-boiled authors seem verbose, yet he is still able to paint grim images with his prose that stay in the reader's mind.<br />This book, as well as the others in the series, draws obvious parallels to Richard Stark's superb Parker series. Like Burke, Parker is a thief and a killer with few scruples, but an abiding respect for his own unique code of honor. Although &quot;Pain Management&quot; is not as good as the best of the Stark novels, it is still an interesting, if at times troubling, read.<br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, Mystery Ink	2001-10-17

There is a killer out there who possesses the lethal combination of medical knowledge and a sick, twisted mind. The question is, who is it -- and how can s/he be stopped?<br />Amanda Jaffe, a criminal defense attorney, is on the defense team for Dr. Vincent Cardoni, a smug, unlikable surgeon who is accused of several murders involving acts of brutal, yet exquisitely skilled torture. Cardoni is let off the hook on a technicality, however, before the case even goes to trial.<br />Four years later, Jaffe is hired again to represent a defendant accused of similar killings. This time the suspect is none other than Cardoni's estranged wife. Jaffe persistently digs to the bottom of this mystery and learns the chilling truth behind these unthinkable crimes.<br />This is Philip Margolin's best and scariest book to date. Don't read &quot;Wild Justice&quot; if you have to sleep alone. It *will* scare you!<br />Reviewed by Mystery Ink	2001-10-14

She's back on the job consulting with the London Police Department just months after having her face sliced by a bizarre, fixated loner. Now she's helping the police with a murder investigation, the prime suspect in which is none other than her attacker.<br />The &quot;Red Room&quot; starts out with promise, but quickly turns into a disappointment. &quot;Nicci French&quot; is actually the pseudonym of a married writing team, and the book reads like it. It is very difficult for writers to collaborate on a seamless novel, particularly when it comes to crafting a suspenseful plot. The story never generates any real thrills, and the story is only mildly interesting.<br />It was refreshing to read a story set in London; it was a nice change from the typical American mysteries I usually read. The murder investigation, however -- the heart of the mystery -- left me cold.<br />Reviewed by Mystery Ink	2001-10-11

It combines intriguing mystery with edgy satire, all complemented by wickedly dark humor. Robert Ferrigno has created a fascinating place, populated with some delightfully whacko characters. I couldn't wait to find out what happened to these people next.<br />Perhaps the most surprising thing about &quot;Flinch&quot; is how sympathetic a character Jimmy Gage (the protagonist) turns out to be. Under his callous, jaded, and cynical exterior beats the heart of a warm and honorable man. His character gives the story a firm center, grounding the madness in reality, and thus making the story more moving and effective.<br />Read it for the mystery, read it for the humor -- whatever the reason, just read &quot;Flinch.&quot; You won't be disappointed.<br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, Mystery Ink	2001-10-10

Parker. The body of a dead girl washes up on the shores of a lake and Police Chief Jesse Stone is determined to find out who she is and who killed her. Along the way he uncovers a child prostitution ring, saves a victimized woman from an abusive marriage, and still manages to make time with both his ex-wife and a new lady love.<br />These plot points would probably mean more to us if they seemed to mean more to Stone. He tells us how he feels, revealed in snippets of terse, faux-Hemingway dialogue, but he never shows us anything. As a character, there seems to be very little there.<br />As with the two previous books in the Jesse Stone series (&quot;Night Passage&quot;(1997) and &quot;rouble in Paradise&quot;(1998)), &quot;eath in Paradise&quot;is a pleasant enough read, mildly diverting, and certainly quick. It's a shame, though, that Parker, an author who once defined the hard-boiled mystery genre, doesn't seem to care enough to try very hard anymore. If this were a first novel, I suppose it would be passable enough. For a fortieth, though, it's just filler.<br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, Mystery Ink	2001-10-10

Joe Gores -- one of the few mystery writers to actually have been a private investigator at one time in his life -- has written many acclaimed books over the years. Somehow, though, he has managed to fly under our radar here at Mystery Ink. We suspect it's due more to our inattention to any flaw on Gores' part. Based on the quality of this book, he goes right to the head of the class.<br />Interweaving three complicated plots, along with at least a dozen significant characters, would be beyond the abilities of many writers. For a seasoned veteran like Joe Gores, though, it's a piece of cake. (At least, he makes it seem like it is. I somehow doubt it was quite that easy.) &quot;Cons, Scams &amp; Grifts&quot; is one of the best mysteries I've read this year.<br />--David Montgomery, Mystery Ink	2001-09-24

Now he's working as the police chief of a small department in the fictional town of Bristo Camino, a suburban bedroom community of Los Angeles. Talley thinks he's left the pressure and violence of the big city behind; the stress and strain that ruined his career and his marriage. He is wrong.<br />&quot;Hostage&quot; has a solid premise and interesting characters for the most part. One of the problems I had with the book, though, is that the hero of the story, Chief Talley, was too conflicted, too unsure to give the reader a satisfactory rooting interest. I found myself wanting the man to quit whining and just do his job. We're all used to the protagonist with the troubled past facing and overcoming his demons in the course of saving the day. It's a good premise for a suspense novel. In this case, though, Talley's demons are more annoying than haunting, and some of his thoughts and actions are less than inspiring.<br />I don't mean to suggest that &quot;Hostage&quot; is a bad book, or even an unentertaining one. It's neither of those. It was, however, a bit of a disappointment for me.<br />Reviewed by David Montgomery, Mystery Ink	2001-09-18

Sid Bifulco ratted out his Mafia family to the Feds, but the idea of entering the Witness Protection Program when he gets out of prison is about as attractive as a three-day-dead mackerel. Instead he decides to make his home along the Delaware river so that he can pursue his new-found passion of fishing. (Don't ask how a mobster decided to become a fisherman; the explanation is a good one and I don't want to give it away.)<br />&quot;Sleep with the Fishes&quot; is a good, quick, amusing read.

Dr. Toby Harper is a tough, intelligent woman with too much to do and too little time. An ER doctor working the night shift at Springer Hospital in the Boston suburbs, Toby must also act as caretaker for her Alzheimer's-stricken mother during the day while trying to catch some sleep. As difficult as her routine is, things take a turn for the worse when Dr. Harper finds her life completely unraveling in a matter of only weeks. Dr. Wallenberg, a geriatrics specialist, has devoted his career to researching a way to extend life beyond its normal span. His blind passion leads to the deaths of many, but in the name of progress he continues his experiments. He finds his subjects among the elderly who are wealthy enough and desperate enough to risk anything for a chance at longevity. Aside from the nuisance of dying patients, Dr. Wallenberg is well on his way to success until Toby Harper enters the scene.<BR>This is yet another triumph for Gerritsen. I have also read Gerritsen's first thriller, &quot;Harvest&quot; (1996), and I thoroughly enjoyed both. &quot;Life Support&quot; has interesting medical aspects without getting too dry or detailed. It also benefits from realistic characters and dialogue, and a good dose of creepiness that heightens the suspense. The story's end is a bit disappointing as it dips into the improbable, but the book is nonetheless a definite must-read.	2001-08-30

The Northern Union Railroad, one of the largest railroad companies in the country, has suffered from a streak of back luck that would make a statistician's hair stand on end. In the past eighteen months, no fewer than a half dozen of their freight trains have mysteriously derailed. When one of their boxcars is found covered in blood, though, they know that something other than luck is involved.<br />The Northern Union calls in Peter Tyler, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), to find out just what's going on. It's the first assignment for the former Washington DC homicide detective, and Tyler eagerly jumps on board the investigation, anxious to start over from the premature end of his police career.   <br />This is not one of Ridley Pearson's finer works.  I have read and enjoyed Pearson's Lou Boldt series in the past, but cannot say the same for this book.  The writing is nothing special, the plot is predictable (thus eliminating any suspense), and the characters are underdeveloped. If you are interested in trains, it's worth a read. Otherwise, I'd pass on buying a ticket for this ride.<br />--David Montgomery, Mystery Ink	2001-08-19

The plot sometimes stretches the bounds of credibility a bit much, but that is to be expected in an action-thriller like this. There are also times when Dr. Jon Smith (the protagonist) borders on becoming a superhero rather than a true character, but he is generally very likeable, if never quite realistic.<br />In the past I have read some of Philip Shelby's work and thought that he showed promise. I have been impressed by his skills as a wordsmith, but found his story ideas to be somewhat lacking. Combining his writing talents here with the imagination of Robert Ludlum, however, has produced a blockbuster of a novel. This is not great literature by any means, but it is an engrossing story that will definitely keep you turning the pages.<br />With his death earlier this year, Robert Ludlum left a huge void in the international suspense/thriller genre. Thankfully, we do have writers like Philip Shelby and Gayle Lynds who are eager to take up his mantle. If &quot;The Cassandra Compact&quot; never rises to the level of the best of Ludlum's work -- and it doesn't -- reading it is still a very pleasing way to pass some time.<br />--David Montgomery, Mystery Ink	2001-08-19

Charles Knief's series featuring Hawaiian private investigator John Caine is often compared to John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee series, and there are certainly some common points of reference. Both are knights errant with slightly tarnished armor, men of honor who live in a world in which honor is more frequently scorned than praised. Both live simple lives on boats in interesting environments. Both have seen more pain in their lives than they want to remember, yet are still always willing to help out a friend or someone in need.<br />Charles Knief did a good job writing his first mystery. He's created an interesting, likeable character to build his series upon. I particularly like the Hawaiian setting of &quot;Diamond Head,&quot; finding it to be a nice change from the usual locales. The only area in which I found this book lacking was in some of the plotting, which dragged a bit at times, even though it's a short book. It's a good story, but it would have been better if it had been wound a little tighter.<br />The Travis McGee series has long been one of my favorites and will always hold a special place in my heart. MacDonald captured some magic when he created McGee and Meyer and the &quot;Busted Flush.&quot; His death left a hole in the mystery genre that no one can fill. Charles Knief and his creation John Caine, although not able to erase that void, do a good job of reminding the reader what a good mystery -- and a good man -- are.	2001-08-10

Alex McKnight is a former Detroit police officer who now works as a private investigator in upstate Michigan on the frozen banks of Lake Superior. McKnight was forced to retire on disability when he was critically wounded and his partner was murdered by a psychotic killer named Maximilian Rose.<br />That happened many years ago, though, and McKnight is trying to put it behind him. Rose is in prison serving a life sentence without parole and McKnight is getting on with his new existence in the small town of Paradise.<br />Alex McKnight is one of the most likeable and realistic protagonists for a mystery series that I have come across in quite a while. Most authors in the genre are unwilling to allow their heroes to show fear or weakness, to have them appear to be less than superhuman. Hamilton draws McKnight as a much more humble figure, though, showing him with all of his flaws, as well as his doubts and pain.<br />When &quot;A Cold Day in Paradise&quot; was published in 1998, it won the Edgar Award for Best First Novel, a justly-deserved accolade. Author Steve Hamilton has done a wonderful job of crafting an intriguing, page-turning mystery that would be the envy of most more seasoned writers. This series is off to a very promising start.	2001-08-07

This solid debut novel from the lawyer once named one of Time magazine's &quot;Future Leaders of America&quot; focuses on the highly personal, highly controversial issue of abortion. It is billed as a story of medical suspense, but it also combines political and legal elements into a fascinating, thought-provoking, and gripping plot.<br />Several characters share center stage in &quot;The Fourth Procedure.&quot; The most interesting of them is Congressman Jack MacLeod, a pro-choice politician who finds himself the center of attention when anti-abortionist protesters focus their efforts on his home turf of Syracuse, New York. There the pro-life leader Eli Graves, a rather unsympathetic character, digs up the dirt from Jack's past, threatening to expose his dark past.<br />The medical aspects of &quot;The Fourth Procedure&quot; appear to be well-researched and accurate, a definite plus. In addition to providing a well-crafted and exciting story, Pottinger does an excellent job of showing both sides of the abortion issue, placing his characters in soul-searching situations that prompt the reader to wonder, &quot;what if it were me?&quot; <br />If you like a book that challenges you to think a little while it entertains you, then you should enjoy this remarkable debut from a very promising writer. I look forward to what he does next.	2001-08-04

Paris Minton is an unlikely protagonist for a mystery novel. An African American man, approaching middle age, he runs a used bookstore in a 1950s LA ghetto. He doesn't make much money from his business, but that's not why he has the shop. He just wants the chance to read his books and be left alone. That dream ends the day a beautiful woman named Elana Love walks in the door. &quot;Fearless Jones&quot; features an improbable hero, perhaps, but a classic setup for a hardboiled story. <br />The comparisons to Mosley's brilliant Easy Rawlins series are natural and deserved. Both are set in similar times and deal with similar themes. The character of Paris Minton, though, adds a new dimension to the story. A thoughtful, literate man, he's not very handy with his fists, awkward with guns, and a patsy for a gorgeous woman. Most hard-boiled characters are just that: hard. Paris, though, is far softer than most, and more interesting for it. <br />&quot;Fearless Jones&quot; once again demonstrates that Walter Mosley is one of the finest writers working today. His sharp eye for race relations, human nature, and the changing face of America would be excellent contributions to any novel. When added to a solid, engrossing mystery, they take his work to a higher level that few can match. Mosley is a treasure who should be read by all.	2001-07-27

If the heist was a little flashier than Parker ordinarily liked, it still got the job done. The problems began when it came time to settle up. Rather than pay him his full share, Parker's three co-conspirators informed him that they were &quot;borrowing&quot; his take. They needed it as seed money for a big job in Palm Beach, so they left him high and dry. That was their first mistake. Their biggest mistake, though, was leaving him alive.<br />Richard Stark's intriguingly misanthropic master thief is back for yet another hard boiled adventure and it's a very good one. Bouncing back from the disappointing &quot;Backflash,&quot; this time out the author has his noir chops finely honed. He keeps the prose appropriately stark and close to the bone. That's just what Parker's stories require. He is not a man who lives in a world of many colors or flavors and this book reflects that in its writing.<br />The plot is swift and uncomplicated, allowing us to appreciate Parker's brilliant criminal instincts and disdain for conventional morality. It takes a good writer to make a person who's not very likable into a convincing protagonist and Stark does a top notch job of it.  It doesn't hurt that most of the people Parker meets, criminal or not, are just as crooked as he is.<br />&quot;Flashfire&quot; makes for an excellent, quick summer read.	2001-07-26

The nominal hero is Cleveland homicide detective Jack Paris, a troubled man trying to survive life, divorce, and fatherhood, all while attempting to solve a series of brutal murders which seem to be connected to the mysterious death of a brother officer.<br />Author Richard Montanari has the stark images of hard-boiled noir down pat. His story is fairly gruesome, somewhat confusing, and quite interesting. His prose is dark and sparse, but thankfully ungimicky. He plays with the structure a bit, intercutting the first person POV of the killer with the more standard third person narrative following the investigator. This technique--one I'm not often fond of--works well at heightening both the tension and the revulsion factor. Definitely not for the weak-stomached.<br />Although the dust jacket bills &quot;Kiss of Evil&quot; as &quot;a novel of suspense&quot; it's not particularly suspenseful or gripping. The emphasis is more on character and the psychological aspects of the case. There are elements of &quot;cat and mouse&quot; detection, but those aren't the focus. Montanari is more concerned with plumbing the depths of the psycho-sexual morass that Paris encounters, and the book is the better for it.	2001-06-05

That's a question we all must wrestle with at some point in our lives; what to believe in, what to hold on to. It's a question that cancer researcher Dr. Laura Donaldson has never had much trouble with. She's always placed her faith in the rational world of science. But when her promising cancer treatment results in her patient's death rather than her recovery, Donaldson's faith is shaken. When the blood of David Haines, a serial killer who preys on doctors, seems to hold out an even greater promise for a cure, her belief system is all but shattered.<br />FBI agent Kevin Sheldrake struggles with his own demons. As a young man he was a member of a religious cult. When his fellow believers abandoned him, Sheldrake gave up on God; at least, he tried to. But that hole inside him (C.S. Lewis' &quot;God-shaped vacuum&quot;) kept aching to be filled and no amount of prayer or fasting would satisfy him. Perhaps there is hope, though, in redemption, the redemption that would come if he could do the Lord's work by capturing a killer.<br />Those intriguing questions form the philosophical soul of this pulse-pounding thriller, a remarkable debut for Kenneth Oppel, previously known only as the author of children's books. Somewhere along the way, though, he learned to craft tense, page-turning suspense, and all-too-humanly flawed characters who are both intriguing and believable. His prose is swift and deft, and his plotting is equal to that of most more experienced thriller writers.<br />I eagerly await the next novel from Mr. Oppel. I just hope it's not a kid's book!	2001-05-30

Hot shot attorney Beth Convey, the recent recipient of a heart donation, begins to recall strange memories that were not part of her life before. Faces, images, words, even phone numbers appear in her mind out of nowhere. Could they be the thoughts of her heart donor, somehow transplanted along with the organ?<br />This controversial question is at the heart of Lynds' new thriller &quot;Mesmerized.&quot; Built upon it is a slightly better-than-average plot involving a scheme to return the Communists to power in today's battered, corrupt Russia. The previous owner of Convey's new heart was one of the conspirators and her new memories plunge her into the middle of the coup.<br />&quot;Mesmerized&quot; has plenty of action, intrigue, and a variety of twists and turns. Maybe too many. The story drags on longer than the suspense can sustain it. At parts it risks becoming downright dull, which is death for any thriller. The character of Convey is believable enough (even if her condition isn't), but her partner-in-crime, ex-FBI agent Jeff Hammond, doesn't ring as true. There are also a few too many convenient coincidences that damage the believability of the story.  The plot is a good one, though, and Lynds always manages to keep you turning the pages.<br />--David Montgomery, Mystery Ink	2001-05-16

Interesting, gruesome, violent story about Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker, a New York cop who's life is destroyed by a creepy serial killer called the Traveling Man.  I found the story to be very interesting, with a good plot and good characters. Some of the prose, however, was too dense for my taste.  The description (in places) slowed the pace down and detracted from the tension.  Thrillers need to move fairly steadily in order to keep the reader tightly-wound and this book slipped in a few spots.<br />I do recommend it, though, to anyone who can stomach the violence!  There are definitely some gruesome parts. (Such things don't bother me, but I realize that some are more sensitive.)  A solid debut for a first novel (from an Irishman writing about the American South no less!).<br />--David Montgomery, Mystery Ink	2001-05-07

Andy &quot;Gio&quot; Giobberti is not a very attractive guy. He's a self-pitying womanizer who drinks too much and has little but contempt for his job, his colleagues, even himself. He wasn't always like that. But when his carelessness caused the death of his five-year-old daughter, life, and everything else, lost most of its meaning for him.<br />Gio's latest case is the apparent homicide of a young African American girl who was shot point-blank while lying in her bed at home. The obvious suspect is drug dealer &quot;LL&quot; who was seen fleeing the scene. Gio is ready to put him away, despite the lack of motive or any solid evidence. His own feelings of guilt have more to do with that than the merits of the case.<br />Readers looking for &quot;the next John Grisham&quot; will probably be disappointed by Reuland's book. It's not a legal thriller at all. But if you're interested in a touching story of a man's pain and self-destruction, you should find a lot to appreciate in &quot;Hollowpoint.&quot;	2001-04-28

Lifelong pals since they hooked up in a San Francisco orphanage, Artie Woo and Quincy Durant are two of the best characters you'll come across in any thriller.  Nobody plumbs the depths of corruption and works a great con like this dynamic duo of the Pacific Rim.  Throw in the likes of grifter Otherguy Overby, CIA master Whittaker Lowell James, and a former folk trio named Ivory, Lace, and Silk, and you've got the makings for one helluva adventure.<br />&quot;Chinaman's Chance&quot; is a delight to read.  The juicy, twisted tale of opportunists on the make was tailor-made for Ross Thomas' fast-paced, witty style.  He had a remarkable ability of making cynical characters likable and complex plots believable.  His novels are &quot;page-turners,&quot; but they're also insightful and poignant sketches of the human condition.  He was truly an uncommon talent.	2001-04-12

He grew to manhood as the student of a legendary master of Go, the Japanese board game that takes chess to a spiritual level. <br />With such a bizarre background, is it any wonder that Hel became the world's most accomplished assassin, the killer of dozens of targets?  Now, however, Nicholai has retired to his grand chateau in the Pyrenees, content to live the rest of his life among the Basque with his Eurasian concubine. <br />Of course, we know, as seasoned readers, that there's no way Hel is going to be allowed to rest in peace. The Mother Company -- the super-secret cartel that actually controls the world's governments -- is determined to make use of Hel, one way or another. <br />If this description of &quot;Shibumi&quot; sounds different from your average thriller, that's because Trevanian is not your average thriller writer. In many ways this book is more reminiscent of the works of James Clavell than Robert Ludlum. There's certainly a healthy component of action and suspense in &quot;Shibumi,&quot; particularly when Hel goes on spelunking adventures in forbidding mountain caves. What's more notable, though, is the history and poetry that the author brings to his story. He has obvious regard for and knowledge of the peoples and places that he describes in such lush detail. <br />I only wish Trevanian wrote more books. I recommend them all to you.	2001-04-11

Ex-MP Jack Reacher has dropped out of society and is spending his days wandering the American South. All is well until he spots the town of Margrave, Georgia on a map. His brother had talked once about visiting Margrave, supposedly the town where legendary blues man Blind Blake was killed. That's when Jack makes the fateful decision to get off the bus and poke around.<br />Lee Child's books had been recommended to me on several occasions prior to my actually reading one. After months of procrastinating I finally picked this up and was pleasantly surprised to find a real winner. &quot;Killing Floor&quot; is an excellent, suspenseful example of the corrupt town novel (done so well by Ross Thomas, among others), and Jack Reacher is a terrific character. (My only complaint would be that it's a little longer than it needs to be--if it had been pared down some, it would be even more gripping.)<br />You'd never know from reading &quot;Killing Floor&quot; that the author is an Englishman. He has the flavors of America down pat. What a fine debut!  I look forward to reading more from Mr. Child.	2001-03-14

The classic game of cat and mouse is an evergreen of the mystery genre, and few practice it better than John Sandford and his creation, Minneapolis police detective Lucas Davenport. This is ably demonstrated in the sixth book in the Prey series, &quot;Night Prey.&quot;<br />Davenport, hired back by the new police chief to investigate their toughest cases, is pursuing one of the most violent killers he's ever encountered. The unknown perpetrator commits acts of extreme brutality against women, murdering with incredible force and viciousness.<br />As always, Sandford keeps the plot interesting and the action swift, leading us through the investigation along with Davenport as he unravels the Gordian knot of clues and evidence. At the same time, the author gives us the killer's viewpoint, showing us a glimpse of his twisted mind. Sandford excels at this type of parallel storytelling, upping the urgency of Lucas catching the nutcase before he kills again.<br />If you haven't yet had the joy of reading this excellent series, I recommend you start with the first book (&quot;Rules of Prey&quot;) and enjoy some of the best writing in the genre.	2001-03-09

African American detective Lew Griffin first appeared back in 1992 in this novel by acclaimed, although largely unknown, author James Sallis. The story follows Griffin as he investigates four cases of missing persons. His success varies and even when he locates the people he's looking for, he never actually finds the object of his search. <br />This mystery is not really a mystery at all. Rather, it's the story of thirty years in the life of a hurting, flawed man trying to live a quiet existence in New Orleans. Rather than being epic in its sweep, though, &quot;Fly&quot; is minimalist. Sallis is a poet in addition to being an author and it shows in this book. <br />I suppose it's understandable that Sallis hasn't enjoyed wider success in the genre--his books certainly don't grab you in the same way that most mysteries do--but it's definitely a shame. Readers who are interested in more than simply solving a mystery will definitely find something to admire in this book.	2001-03-01

Jack Montgomery is a devious man, acting in the shadows of legality, determined to carry out his own agenda, regardless of what the president or anyone else thinks. Peterson uncovers his Machiavellian misdeeds as part of her efforts to protect him, thus putting her own life in jeopardy.<br />Steve Samuel has written an interesting, if somewhat far-fetched, story for his debut novel.

McClaren Life and Casualty is the kind of staid, respectable insurance company that inspires trust.  That's one of the reasons that John Walker took a job there as an insurance analyst. Spending his days toiling away, staring at a computer screen in his cubicle, he certainly wasn't expecting any action or danger.  When tight-lipped investigator Max Stillman enters the picture, though, that changes very quickly.<br />Part of the joy of reading &quot;Death Benefits&quot; is watching the plot unfold as we, along with John Walker, are drawn deeper into the mystery. Perry's skillful plotting slowly peels away the layers of the crime as he gradually tightens the screws of suspense. He really is a master at this kind of book.<br />&quot;Death Benefits&quot; appears to be a stand-alone novel, although these characters would certainly be very welcome in a return.  Adding this to the superb  Jane Whitefield series, Perry proves that he is one of the absolute best writers in the genre today. If you're not reading him, you should be.	2001-02-12

Smart and sophisticated, he's a former Wall Street whiz with an MBA and a head for business. He's also got manners, loves his ex-wife, and drinks Remy Martin rather than Rolling Rock. This ain't your father's PI!<br />J.J. and his eccentric partner, the rotund, brilliant Dr. Boris Koulomzin, help people solve their problems. Usually those problems are more on the order of corporate crime, but this time out the duo is helping a social worker who's worried about a precocious young boy who's mother has been murdered. It turns out the boy is something of a genius himself, which means he fits in very well with the good doctor.<br />The best thing about this book is the rogue's gallery of colorful characters, not the least of them Donovan and Dr. Koulomzin. They reminded me a little of Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe, although in this care they're partners, rather than employee and employer. The building they live in has enough intriguing weirdoes to keep this series interesting for a long time.<br />This is an excellent debut from a promising new author.

That didn't stop him, though, from finding the man who killed the former owner of his new heart.  This time out he's in better shape and it's a good thing, too.<br />Terry is asked by a former colleague in the Sheriff's department to look into a troubling murder that shows no promise of being solved.  McCaleb begins to investigate, trying to understand the killer's thoughts and motivations.  He is soon shocked to discover that his profile seems to fit one person perfectly: LAPD Detective Harry Bosch.

His plotting is swift and gripping, the details perfect, and the characters intriguing and believable.  It's amazing that such a normal-seeming writer can create such madness on paper.  <br />This book is highly recommended, both for fans of Connelly's, and for new readers as well.	2001-01-30

Sandford's books following Minneapolis Police Detective Lucas Davenport are some of the best I've discovered in a long time.  I'm working my way through the series and loving it!<br />Davenport is a maverick, brilliant, somewhat-womanizing detective.  I wasn't sure at first whether or not I'd like the character, but I quickly found myself a big fan of his.  He's a cocky loner on the surface, but the digger you deep, the more sensitivity and warmth you find.  Sandford has done a wonderful job of creating a character who is both intriguing and believable.  (If you're hoping to create a mystery series, you'd better come up with a compelling protagonist and Sandford has certainly done that.)<br />This book finds Davenport on the trail of a cunning serial killer who sticks to a carefully thought-out set of rules in an attempt to escape capture (hence the title of the book).  The mystery really kept me on my toes, wondering how Lucas would manage to capture this deranged murdered.<br />John Sandford's Prey series is recommended to fans of Michael Connelly, Robert B.

This latest entry in the Matt Scudder seires is a haunting powerful tale of life, death, and loss. Scudder, the private investigator and reformed drunk, is older now; perhaps not wiser, but clearly interested in slowing down. He's married, he actually has a license from the state, he's not the carefree man he was ten or twenty years ago.<br />Scudder's life, though, will not necessarily allow him to just walk away. In particular, his close friendship with organized crime &quot;boss&quot; Mick Ballou proves very troublesome. Some unknown gang is attacking Ballou and his associates, and Matt finds himself caught up in the middle of it. Despite his ties to Ballou, he still tries to stay out of it. Friendship will only carry him so far. But when his own life is threatened as well, he is left with little choice.<br />The plot is interesting and suspenseful, the mystery entertaining as Block's always are. But more than that, this is a moving book, a book that touches you and makes you think. The title Everybody Dies may be more figurative than literal, but there is still enough death and pain in this book to reach even the coldest heart.	2001-01-17

Apparently Eszterhas basically stole most of this information from other people's books (Gennifer Flowers, Monica Lewinsky, etc.). Very little of it is original. As I had feared, the author has nothing new to say about this saga. It's the same tabloid trash that you've heard a hundred times before. His only original contributions are composed of long imagined dialogues from Bill Clinton's penis, pornographic fantasies of Kenneth Starr, and similar failures at hilarity.<br />&quot;American Rhapsody&quot; is not a boring book. It contains passages that will make you laugh, passages that will make you sick, and passages that will make you mad. This is inflammatory material and it's no great trick to make it provocative. It was, however, more of a trick to make it into a good book that Eszerthas could manage.	2001-01-17

His greatest contribution was the  \\"frontier thesis,\\" first advanced in 1893. The Turner thesis (as it is also  known) stated, in brief, that \\"the existence of an area of free land, its  continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward,  explain American development.\\"<br />This thesis has been one of the most  important and lasting interpretations of American history. It has also been  one of the most repudiated, challenged, and attacked theories, so it has  certainly needed its defenders over the years. Turner had one defender,  however, who stood head and shoulders above the rest. That was Ray Allen  Billington, a noted scholar in his own right, the former curator of the  Huntington Library, and one of Turner's staunchest and most tireless  disciples.<br />In writing The Far Western Frontier (first published in 1962),  Billington had two expressed purposes in mind, which he laid out in the  preface. The first was to describe, in all possible detail, the movement of  settlers into America's Far West, along with the events, both national and  international, that influenced their migration. His second objective was  \\"to advance evidence pertaining to the generations-old conflict over the  so-called `frontier hypothesis.'\\" Implicit in that second purpose was  Billington's desire to advance evidence in favor of the frontier hypothesis  (i.e., the Turner thesis).<br />The Far Western Frontier tells the story of  America's western migration from approximately 1830 to 1860. It is divided  into twelve chapters, each telling the history of the settlement of a  particular region (e.g., \\"the Mexican Borderlands,\\" \\"The Mormons Move  Westward,\\" and \\"the California Gold Rush\\"). As part of his analysis,  Billington judges the extent to which each of these settlement processes  confirmed or refuted Turner's thesis. This is generally done in a subtle  fashion; he seldom engages in any explicit discussion of Turner's  hypothesis. However, the entire book is shot through with the very spirit  of Turner. His presence lingers on every page.<br />As is characteristic of  Billington, The Far Western Frontier is wonderfully literate, informative,  and well written. The lively and eminently readable narrative is only  fitting for a study of the American West-an area of history filled with  great heroes, cowardly villains, and profuse myth-making. Billington,  however, was not one to ignore his responsibilities as a historian in favor  of the pursuit of drama. His methodology is sufficiently rigorous and  objective to give much weight to his arguments.

(The first two were the brilliant &quot;The Godfather&quot; and the above-average &quot;The Last Don.&quot;) Puzo died shortly after completing &quot;Omerta,&quot; so this is the last we will ever read from this great American author. When I first got &quot;Omerta,&quot; I eyed the rather slim size (only 316 pages) and the fairly large type and was worried. My immediate thought was that Puzo died before he could actually finish the book!<br />Once I started reading it, though, I was reassured. The book might be short, but it is good, and it is classic Puzo. The story tells the rise to power of Astorre Viola, foster son and heir of the great Don Raymonde Aprile. The Don has left Astorre in charge of his financial empire, which becomes the target of an evil alliance between a drug kingpin and rival Mafioso.<br />Astorre must not only defend the Aprile fortune, but his own life, as well as those of the Don's children. He is beset on all sides, just only by the mob and their contract killers, but also by the FBI, and the NYPD. His chances of success might seem slim, but underestimating Astorre is always a mistake--usually a fatal one.<br />I found the plot to be an interesting one, but it is not fully developed enough to be as gripping and exciting as it could be. It definitely seems incomplete in areas. For example, the book refers to Astorre's years in Sicily, but we only catch glimpses of those formative events. Also many of the characters (especially the Don's children) seem only partly drawn, never fully formed.<br />Might Puzo have intended to write more, to flesh out these characters and their lives? We can't know, but I suspect he did. The book would certainly be much better had he been able to.<br />&quot;Omerta&quot; is clearly the least successful book in Puzo's Mafia trilogy. It can't come close to equaling the brilliance of &quot;The Godfather&quot; or even &quot;The Last Don.&quot; That doesn't mean it's a bad book. I actually enjoyed reading it very much. But when judged by the standard that Puzo set in the past, &quot;Omerta&quot; has to rank as a disappointment.	2000-07-27

Three people in different parts of the U.S. die suddenly and dramatically of a bizarre, unknown virus. What connection could there be between them? And how can this virus be stopped before it claims more victims?<br />That's the set-up for this collaboration between thriller-meister Robert Ludlum and relative newcomer Gayle Lynds. This is something new for Ludlum, a series written in conjunction with other authors (ala Tom Clancy's Op-Center books). This is to be the first in a series of adventure-thrillers about a government action squad called \\"Covert One.\\" I'm withholding judgment on the concept until more books come out, but for now I'm cautiously optimistic.<br />The story is solid, although familiar. It's obviously reminiscent of Richard Preston's \\"The Hot Zone,\\" along with dozens of thrillers. That's not to say it's bad, though. I enjoyed the swiftly-moving plot, and found the characters to be interesting. The protagonist is Lt. Col. Jon Smith, a medical doctor, expert on killer viruses, and all-around man-of-action. He's a fairly typical lead character for a book of this sort. Smith is interesting enough, though, and smarter than the norm, which was a nice change.<br />Even better was the character of Smith's sidekick, Martin Zellerbach, a computer genius with a rare form of autism. I hope he returns in subsequent books because I found him fascinating.<br />This reads like Ludlum-lite, featuring his brand of paranoid action and suspense, but without the depth of plotting and sophistication that characterizes his best work. It's noticeably different from the rest of his output, although maybe that's a plus given the quality of his last few books.<br />\\"The Hades Factor\\" is recommended for thriller lovers and anyone looking for an exciting summer read.	2000-07-11

He is the former Henry R. Luce Professor of American Culture at Northwestern University and the author of numerous books, including &quot;Reagan's  America,&quot; &quot;Nixon Agonistes,&quot; and &quot;Lincoln at  Gettysburg,&quot; for which he won the Pulitzer Prize. &quot;The Kennedy  Imprisonment&quot; is one of his best, a book filled with intriguing  insights into the most famous of American families. It is an extremely well  written, entertaining, and important book.<br />Wills is primarily conducting  a &quot;meditation on power.&quot; He examines the notion of power as it  pertained to the three most famous Kennedy brothers: John, Robert, and  Edward. It all began with their father, the person who influenced them  most. Joseph Kennedy--bootlegger, Hollywood mogul, and Ambassador to the  Court of Saint James--was a man of great ambition. At one time, he had  presidential aspirations of his own. When those fizzled, he transferred  them to his sons, first Joe Jr. and then Jack.<br />The elder Kennedy  manipulated his son's career and, more importantly, his image with all of  his considerable skill. He had John's senior paper published as a book,  &quot;Why England Slept.&quot; He exaggerated John's war record with an  article in the &quot;New Yorker.&quot; He orchestrated his campaign to win  the Pulitzer Prize for &quot;Profiles in Courage,&quot; a book John did not  actually write. Image, not substance, was what really mattered, and it was  an early source of John Kennedy's, and, by extension, his brothers',  power.<br />When John Kennedy ascended to the presidency--that is, when he  rose to power--he was determined to be the antithesis of Dwight Eisenhower.  Ike was old, Jack was young. Ike ruled by committee, Jack by fiat. Ike was  tranquil, Jack was active. Most importantly, Kennedy was a man with  charisma, in the sense that Max Weber meant it. Eisenhower ruled as a  traditional &quot;father-king.&quot; His authority came from his  distinguished record of accomplishments and the dignity of his office.  Kennedy's authority, however, came from within himself. His power emanated  from his force of will, energy, self-confidence, brash intelligence, and  personal style.<br />The man was what was important, not the office or the  institution. His decisions were swift and arbitrary; he thrived in crisis,  a common characteristic of the charismatic leader. He even created crises  when necessary (e.g., the US Steel confrontation) and intensified them once  they occurred (e.g., the standoff with Cuba). He saw the role of government  as &quot;defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger.&quot; He treated  the Soviet menace as a &quot;twilight struggle&quot; with the enemy of  freedom (shades of the Evil Empire). In crisis, he was at his best, able to  demonstrate to everyone that he was the one man, the single hero that could  save them.<br />His charisma allowed Kennedy to recruit his illustrious circle  of disciples; the &quot;best and the brightest.&quot; They were attracted  by the power and the glamour of the Kennedy presidency, eager to become  knights riding in service to Camelot. They were men who would not otherwise  have been willing to serve in subordinate positions, but were glad to do so  when it meant working for a Kennedy.<br />Having such competent advisors  allowed him to utilize his power in broad and aggressive ways.  Unfortunately, this also worked to his disadvantage. A sense of &quot;we're  so smart, we can do anything&quot; pervaded the White House, resulting in  unwise and even foolhardy decisions being made. This was seen most  prominently in their dealings with Cuba and Vietnam.<br />Kennedy's style as  president was unlike anything seen before. He was young and handsome,  married to a sophisticated, beautiful woman-such a refreshing change from  the stodgy, conservative Eisenhower years. Kennedy was a swinger, a man's  man, a dedicated student of the Sinatra-Hemingway-Mailer school of macho  bravado. He loved Hollywood and the Rat Pack and James Bond. He courted  Marilyn and had assignations with a mobster's moll.<br />This style helped  mold the image, helped create the charisma, helped feed the power. It made  Jack a legend, but it hurt Bobby, and it crippled Ted. After Dallas,  Camelot was over and the memories of the good times turned to acid in the  stomachs of many Americans. They were still willing to accept Bobby--after  all, he'd been there in the beginning--but when it came to Teddy, they were  far less forgiving. After Chappaquidick, his hopes of one day following  Jack were all but gone.<br />The power, prestige, and success of the Kennedy  brothers followed a downward curve from Jack to Ted. After Jack was  assassinated, there was still Bobby, the trusted younger brother and  confidant, to carry on the dream. Ultimately, he proved a less than able  caretaker. Even if he could have beaten Humphrey, he likely would have lost  to Nixon, the ultimate defeat for a Kennedy. When he too was killed, the  responsibility fell on Ted's shoulders and he was not strong enough to  carry that much weight. <br />The burden of living three lives, with his the  least important, was too heavy for Ted to bear. That is the true meaning of  the title, the Kennedy imprisonment. Ted is a prisoner of the past, both  his brothers' and his own. He is a prisoner of lost hopes and abandoned  dreams, of what might have been and what never was. Teddy, the youngest and  nicest, but the least capable, could never meet those expectations. He  never could be Jack and, failing that, he could not even be Bobby. To live  up to the ideal of two martyred heroes is too much to ask of anyone, even a  Kennedy.	2000-07-04

Roger Zelazny wrote many popular and award-winning books during his long and distinguished writing career (e.g., &quot;Lord of Light&quot; and &quot;Madwand.&quot;)  Truth be told, though, I didn't care for most of  them.  They seem too esoteric and not particularly interesting to me.  Ah,  but then there's the Amber series.  Now that's a different story!<br />If I  told you that this is the best series of books that I've ever read (and  I've read thousands of books), would you believe me?  Probably not.  But  it's true.  Zelazny captured lightning in a bottle when he wrote these 10  books--I only wish there were a hundred!<br />The 10 books of the Chronicles  of Amber (collected here at last in a single volume!) are divided into two  separate, interlocked series.  The first tells the adventures of Corwin,  Prince of Amber; the second, those of his son Merlin.  If you twisted my  arm, I'd say that the first series is better than the second.  But read  them yourself and you can decide.<br />Amber is one of the most intricate,  original, and fascinating fantasy worlds you will ever find outside of  Tolkien.  It is a world of magic, science, illusions, and reality.  The  basic principle is that the universe consists of an infinite number of  parallel worlds, all of which are echoes and reflections (called Shadows)  of the one true city of Amber.  The people, cultures, traditions,  histories, even the physics of those Shadows exist in a multitude of  varying degrees.  Whatever kind of world or time or place you're looking  for, it exists somewhere in Shadow.  (Earth as we know it, for example, is  merely one Shadow.)<br />The only people who can move freely throughout those  Shadows are the Princes and Princesses of Amber, the Royal blood of the  ruling family; a large collection of siblings of various ages and  dispositions who find it very hard to get along.  That is where the  brilliance of the Amber series comes in: the endless struggles, alliances,  betrayals, andmachinations of this very driven and political family who  all want to gain control of Amber.  Clausewitz would be proud of the  ruthless cunning displayed by this clan.  Their battles and adventures make  for incredible reading.<br />I'm not going to try to describe the plots of the  books to you.  Part of the joy of this series is the fascination of  discovery.  I return to these books every few years and read them again  with joy and awe.  I can think of no other group of books that I would  recommend so highly to you.  They are to be read and cherished, again and  again.  Buy a copy today!	2000-06-08

The transition was from the old-style, traditional federalism that existed prior to the 1930s, to the new, \\"cooperative federalism\\" that  came into being.  The New Deal was enacted under the auspices of this  cooperation between the federal and state governments.  Patterson examines  this relationship, how effective it was, and its results.<br />The  implementation of the New Deal was, of course, a very contentious issue.   The cooperative federalism that was supposed to be going on often failed to  live up to its name.  There were constant battles between federal agents  and state politicians and administrators.  The federal officials criticized  the states for their poor administrative systems, while the state  representatives complained that the federal government was not contributing  enough money, and what money they did contribute was distributed  improperly.  Roosevelt wanted to leave the states alone as much as  possible, allowing them to experiment in their own way whenever it was  feasible.  Patterson believes, however, that the system would have been  better implemented, and the people better served, had the states been given  a lesser role.  Ultimately, Roosevelt realized that legislation at the  national level was the best solution for the problems facing a modern  nation.<br />No two people, according to Patterson, seem to agree on the New  Deal's impact on the states.  Those friendly to it described it as a  blessing.  Others argued that it was discriminatory, enriching some states  at the expense of others.  Conservatives saw it as an autocratic Leviathan,  while liberals thought it too timid and conservative.  Patterson seems to  agree with the liberals.  He criticizes some of the New Deal policies (e.g.  the use of the formula for federal matching grants for state relief), but  he also believes that the federal government did not do nearly all that it  could.<br />Patterson does view cooperative federalism, and the impact it had  on the states, positively.  It brought about improvements in state  government, particularly in the areas of administrative efficiency and the  expansion of the merit system in public personnel administration.  It also  hastened the spread of social legislation (e.g. Social Security,  unemployment relief, and labor reform), especially in those states that  passed \\"little New Deals.\\"  The New Deal also increased political  participation in many states by appealing to previously ignored groups,  particularly the underprivileged-blacks, the unemployed, immigrants.  Not  incidentally, these groups tended to vote Democratic, thus reinforcing the  call for more liberal social services.<br />Perhaps the most important,  lasting effect of the New Deal (and cooperative federalism) on the states  was the centralization of American life, and, by extension, the  centralization of power.  During the 1930s, authority passed from the  states to the national government and has remained there ever since.  The  primary reason for this was the states simply lacked the ability to cope  with the problems of urban, mid-twentieth century America.  The federal  government, therefore, was forced to step in and attempt to solve these  problems at the national level.  They assumed a much larger role in both  the economic and social health of the states.  Relations between the  federal and state governments were never to be the same again.	2000-05-25

That monograph was a comprehensive study of money and  its effects on the economy and the nation.  It was one of the most  important works of economics ever written; so well regarded, in fact, that  it contributed to Dr. Friedman's winning of the Nobel Prize in Economic  Sciences in 1976.<br />Milton Friedman is one of the most eminent economists  of the twentieth century.  His pioneering efforts in the field of  monetarism revolutionized the way that economists thought about and studied  the economy.  (In short, monetarism emphasizes the role of money,  especially the supply of money, in the functioning of the economy.  This is  contrasted with Keynesian economics which gives central importance to  expenditures, particularly government expenditures.)<br />The basic premise of  The Great Contraction is that the economic and financial collapse that  occurred between 1929 and 1933-the most severe business cycle contraction  in United States history-was largely the result of the inept application of  monetary policy by the Federal Reserve System.  The Federal Reserve had  ample power to stop the devastating process of monetary deflation and the  collapse of the banking system.  Had they used that power in late 1930 or  even in early or mid-1931, the successive crises that typify the  contraction could almost certainly have been prevented.  Appropriate action  would have lessened the severity of the contraction and probably brought it  to a much earlier end.<br />The most important contributing factor to the  contraction, the authors believe, was the drastic reduction in the supply  of money.  From 1929 to 1933, the money stock fell by 33 percent, a  continuous annual rate of 10 percent.  This had a devastating effect on the  economy.  When the money supply decreases, the amount of funds available  forloans decreases.  This causes interest rates to rise, making it more  expensive for businesses and individuals to borrow money, and,  consequently, making them decrease expenditures on consumption and  investment.  This results in the economy shrinking.<br />During the  contraction of 1929-1933, however, the effects were even more severe.  Due  to the huge decrease in the money stock, banks were unable to acquire  enough high-powered money (vault cash plus funds on deposit at the Federal  Reserve) to meet the demands of depositors.  This forced banks to liquidate  their assets at deep discounts in order to remain open.  This was a dire  short term remedy that wreaked havoc not only on the banks' balance sheets,  but on the bond markets as well.  The rapid selling off of assets, usually  corporate or government bonds, drove prices through the floor which added  to the panic in the financial markets.<br />When their level of assets dropped  low enough, or they were unable to obtain enough funds, banks were forced  to close.  These bank failures further decreased the money stock, resulting  in even more banks closing their doors.  More than one&amp;#64979;fifth of  the commercial banks in the United States, with deposits of close to $7  billion, eventually suspended operations.  Total commercial bank deposits  fell by $18 billion, a drop of over 42 percent.  This vicious circle  finally culminated in March of 1933 with the declaration by President  Roosevelt of a one week banking holiday.  These bank failures played a key  role in the downturn in the economy.  They eradicated people's confidence,  caused an erosion of the financial system, and, most importantly, sharply  curtailed the supply of money.  <br />The Federal Reserve System was  conspicuously absent during this period, especially during the final  banking crisis at the beginning of 1933.  The banks in the System abandoned  their leadership role and instead participated in the general atmosphere of  panic.The proper role for the System at that time, as always, was to act  as a stabilizer for the nation's financial and banking systems and to  ensure a constant flow of money and credit.  It failed in both of these  tasks.  It is clear what course of action should have been taken, just as  it was clear at the time.  The Fed should have engaged in a program of  aggressive open market operations (i.e. the purchase of government  securities).  This would have increased the money stock, particularly the  amount of high-powered money held by banks, and would have helped to stave  off the contraction of deposits and the subsequent bank failures.  It was  not until 1932 that the System undertook such a policy (under pressure from  the Congress), but it was too little, too late.  Its efforts only partially  offset the previous contraction of credit and did nothing to stimulate an  expansion of credit.  The Fed also should have reduced reserve requirements  (the amount of funds banks are required to hold against deposits),  something they did not do until 1933, and then only for thirty days.   Finally, it should have decreased the discount rate (the interest rate the  Fed charges banks to borrow money), which was actually increased at times  during this period.<br />Since the Federal Reserve System had the ability to  undertake measures that almost certainly would have reduced the severity of  the contraction, why did they not do so?  The authors attribute that  failure to a limited understanding on the part of the Board of Governors of  the connections between bank failures, bank runs, the contraction of  deposits, and the weakness of the bond markets.  The Governors tended to  regard bank failures as the result of bad management and banking practices,  or as a consequence of the financial and economic collapse.  They did not  realize that the failures were instead a cause of that collapse, so they  did nothing to prevent them.  Furthermore, during this period there was a  great deal of internal conflict within the System, particularly between the  Governor of the New York Bank and the rest of the Board.  Prior to 1929,  the New York Bank had primacy in the setting of Federal Reserve policy,  something the other members of the Board resented.  Therefore, when the New  York Bank advocated taking strong measures to combat the plunge in the  money stock, the rest of the System resisted and argued against those  recommendations.  Thus, the proper course of action was thwarted and the  contraction increased.	2000-05-25

Image, not substance, was what really mattered, and it was an early source  of John Kennedy's, and, by extension, his brothers', power.<br />When John  Kennedy ascended to the presidency, that is, when he rose to power, he was  determined to be the antithesis of Dwight Eisenhower.  Ike was old, Jack  was young.  Ike ruled by committee, Jack by fiat.  Ike was tranquil, Jack  was active.  Most importantly, Kennedy was a man with charisma, in the  sense that Max Weber meant it.  Eisenhower ruled as a traditional  \\"father-king.\\"  His authority camefrom his distinguished record of  accomplishments and the dignity of his office.  Kennedy's authority,  however, came from within himself.  His power emanated from his force of  will, energy, self-confidence, brash intelligence, and personal style.  The  man was what was important, not the office or the institution.  His  decisions were swift and arbitrary; he thrived in crisis, a common  characteristic of the charismatic leader.  He even created crises when  necessary (e.g., the US Steel confrontation) and intensified them once they  occurred (e.g., the standoff with Cuba).  He saw the role of government as  \\"defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger.\\"  He treated the Soviet  menace as a \\"twilight struggle\\" with the enemy of freedom (shades of the  Evil Empire).  In crisis, he was at his best, able to demonstrate to  everyone that he was the one man, the single hero that could save  them.<br />His charisma allowed Kennedy to recruit his illustrious circle of  disciples; the \\"best and the brightest.\\"  They were attracted by the power  and the glamour of the Kennedy presidency, eager to become knights riding  in service to Camelot.  They were men who would not otherwise have been  willing to serve in subordinate positions, but were glad to do so when it  meant working for a Kennedy.  Having such competent advisors allowed him to  utilize his power in broad and aggressive ways.  Unfortunately, this also  worked to his disadvantage.  A sense of \\"we're so smart, we can do  anything\\" pervaded the White House, resulting in unwise and even foolhardy  decisions being made.  This was seen most prominently in their dealings  with Cuba and Vietnam.<br />Kennedy's style as president was unlike anything  seen before.  He was young and handsome, married to a sophisticated,  beautiful woman-such a refreshing change from the stodgy, conservative  Eisenhower years.  Kennedy was a swinger, a man's man, a dedicated student  of the Sinatra-Hemingway-Mailer school of macho bravado.  He loved  Hollywood and the Rat Pack and James Bond.  He courted Marilyn and had  assignations with a mobster's moll.  This style helped mold the image,  helped create the charisma, helped feed the power.  It made Jack a legend,  but it hurt Bobby, and it crippled Ted.  After Dallas, Camelot was over and  the memories of the good times turned to acid in the stomachs of many  Americans.  They were still willing to accept Bobby--after all, he'd been  there in the beginning--but when it came to Teddy, they were far less  forgiving.  After Chappaquidick, his hopes of one day following Jack were  all but gone.<br />The power, prestige, and success of the Kennedy brothers  followed a downward curve from Jack to Ted.  After Jack was assassinated,  there was still Bobby, the trusted younger brother and confidant, to carry  on the dream.  Ultimately, he proved a less than able caretaker.  Even if  he could have beaten Humphrey, he likely would have lost to Nixon, the  ultimate defeat for a Kennedy.  When he too was killed, the responsibility  fell on Ted's shoulders and he was not strong enough to carry that much  weight.  The burden of living three lives, with his the least important,  was too heavy for Ted to bear. That is the true meaning of the title, the  Kennedy imprisonment.  Ted is a prisoner of the past, both his brothers'  and his own.  He is a prisoner of lost hopes and abandoned dreams, of what  might have been and what never was.  Teddy, the youngest and nicest, but  the least capable, could never meet those expectations.  He never could be  Jack and, failing that, he could not even be Bobby.  To live up to the  ideal of two martyred heroes is too much to ask of anyone, even a Kennedy.	2000-05-12

He was one of the most controversial figures in  American public life; \\"Tricky Dick,\\" the man you loved to hate.  He started  his career as a hero to conservatives, a dedicated anti-Communist, the  vanquisher of Helen Gahagan Douglas and Alger Hiss.  Later he enraged many  those same supporters by imposing wage and price controls and opening China  to the West.  He was the leader of the Silent Majority, the ender of the  Vietnam war.  He was also crippled by disgrace; the only President forced  to resign his office.<br />In the Arena is not a conventional memoir.  Nixon  already covered the essentials in his 1978 volume, &quot;RN.&quot;  Rather,  this is more of an introduction to the man himself; a personal, intimate,  conversational book about how he felt and thought, and what he believed.   It is a reminiscence about the major points in his life, both high and  low-the subtitle of the book is \\"A Memoir of Victory, Defeat, and  Renewal\\"-and a commentary on some of the events that have occurred since  his earlier autobiography.  This is by no means the definitive book on  Nixon, but it does provide intriguing insights into the mind of a most  intriguing man.<br />Some of the more interesting revelations in the book are  Nixon's personal dealings with and reactions to the famous men he knew and  met in his life.  Herbert Hoover, MacArthur, Churchill, de Gaulle,  Adenauer, Kennedy, Eisenhower, and many others.  He had their respect, if  not their friendship, and he was able to deal with them as an equal, both  before and after his presidency.  He relates engaging impressions and  revealing insights of these Titans of history.  Gorbachev, he reveals,was  better educated and more charismatic than Brezhnev so he came off as being  a benign presence, but, in truth, he was no less ruthless.  \\"[B]eneath the  velvet glove he always wears, there is a steel fist.\\"  Mao told Nixon that  he preferred \\"rightists\\" like him because \\"those on the right can do what  those on the left can only talk about.\\"  Chou En-Lai was a ruthless  negotiator with an all-encompassing understanding of international affairs.   MacArthur was the most fascinating speaker he ever met, able to deliver,  off the cuff, hours of brilliant, hypnotic rhetoric.  The only leader Nixon  ever met who could equal him was Lee Kwan Yew of Singapore.<br />Nixon also  writes about Watergate, although, predictably, he makes no stunning  confessions or apologies.  He admits his responsibility for the cover-up,  but denies having any role in the crime itself.  He also continues to  emphasize the political aspects of the scandal.  He paraphrases Talleyrand:  \\"Watergate was worse than a crime-it was a blunder.\\"  He reveals that even  he did not know about all that was going on.  He did not give the matter  sufficient attention because he was preoccupied with his China initiatives  and his efforts to end the war in Vietnam.  He admits regret for  considering options that were clearly illegal.  Ironically, his order to  kill the investigation, the famous \\"smoking gun\\" which ultimately led to  his resignation, was disregarded.  He also discusses his agonizing over  accepting the pardon offered by President Ford.  \\"Next to the resignation,  accepting the pardon was the most painful decision of my political career.\\"   Ultimately, though, he concluded that the continuing obsession by the  people with Watergate was crippling the nation.  That and his own  \\"desperate financial situation\\" left him with little choice.<br />Nixon also  writes passionately about his role in the Vietnam War.  \\"A day did not pass  during my years in the White House that I did not hate the war inVietnam.\\"   Nixon's mother, of course, was a Quaker and his upbringing had to  influence the way he felt about such things.  He especially loathed the  tremendous human suffering caused by war.  Still, he felt that the nation's  course was a necessary one and that our goals in Indochina were \\"worthy and  honorable.\\"  \\"I would have done anything to achieve them by peaceful means.   But no such options were available.\\"  He believed that it was \\"imperative  both morally and strategically\\" to help free the countries of Indochina,  but that did not \\"lessen the burden [he] felt from leading our nation in  war.\\"  As always, Nixon remained committed to the ideal of \\"real peace\\",  that is, an end to war.  We cannot achieve what he calls \\"perfect peace\\"-an  end to conflict-because conflict is the natural state of affairs in the  world.  However, real peace is obtainable, if only we can take the profit  out of war.  He believes that this is possible because the destructiveness  of nuclear weapons has made world war prohibitively expensive, and because  increasing world prosperity has drastically reduced the desire of nations  to increase their wealth by acquiring more territory and resources.	2000-05-12

At times it is too superficial, but overall it is an excellent introduction to the topic.  The  primary theme is that the war accelerated and definitively established the  mixed economy seen in the U.S. today.  (A mixed economy is one where some  goods and services are provided by private enterprise and others, usually  basic infrastructure goods and services, are supplied by the  government.)<br />Particularly good is Vatter's description of the transition  from a civilian to a military economy.  This began in March 1941 with the  passage of the Lend-Lease Act.  Military expenditures in the United States  went from $1.8 billion in 1940 to $6.3 billion in 1941.  One year later  they were a whopping $22.9 billion.  During this same period, military  personnel on active duty increased from half a million people in 1940 to  four million in 1942.<br />The immediate result of this war economy, and the  concomitant explosion in total federal expenditures, was the end of the  Great Depression.  Expenditures increased so rapidly that the federal  deficit more than doubled as a percentage of GNP from 1939 to 1941.  This  Keynesian \\"anti-depression medicine\\" finally ended twelve years of mass  unemployment.  Only the onset of war was sufficient to bring into operation  Keynesian deficit spending of sufficient magnitude to accomplish  this.<br />The war years saw a boom in the United States economy of remarkable  proportions.  From 1940 to 1942 industrial production increased by 58  percent.  Total productivity increased by 16.5 percent from 1941-1945.  The  number of unemployed, which stood at over eight million in 1940, dropped to  only one million in 1943.  The number of women employed increased by a  third (5.2 million individuals), to the point where they comprised  approximately one third of the civilian labor force and enjoyed a 36.3  percent participation rate, at the time a historic high.<br />This huge upturn  in the economy was accompanied by (some would argue, caused by) the  creation of a huge, bureaucratic administration designed to oversee various  sectors of the economy.  The focus of the new bureaucracy was on  production, distribution, pricing, and labor.  Towards that end, an  alphabet soup of 165 new agencies was created, among them the WPB (War  Production Board), OPA (Office of Price Administration),  OPM (Office of  Production Management), and WMC (War Manpower Commission).  Many of these  agencies had overlapping and even competing functions, and their record was  certainly mixed, but Vatter believes that their performance was crucial to  the functioning of the economy. Somewhat amazingly, after the war ended  virtually all of these bureaucracies were dissolved.  However-and this is  the most important part-the success of the wartime economic planning  provided the justification for a new, ongoing role for Big Government in  the economic affairs of the nation.  The United States was never to return  to the laissez-faire policies of the pre-depression era.  From this point  on, the federal government was to assume a crucial role in the supply and  distribution of goods and services, hence the creation of the mixed  economy.<br />Along with this crucial change, the war had several other  consequences as well: full employment; technological innovation (e.g.,  radar, nuclear power, new pharmaceuticals); population growth (the \\"Baby  Boom\\"); and the increased labor force participation of women.  None of  these, however, were nearly so important as the result mentioned above.ipation rate, at the time a historic high.<br />This huge upturn  in the economy was accompanied by (some would argue, caused by) the  creation of a huge, bureaucratic administration designed to oversee various  sectors of the economy.

US	52983693	R3TM8IJD79YP6M	0306802058	909413090	Against The American Grain: Essays Of The Effects Of Mass Culture (A Da Capo paperback)	Books	3	29	32	N	N	Cultural Commentary from a Proud Elitist	&quot;Against the American Grain&quot; is a collection of essays and critical reviews that Macdonald wrote between 1952 and 1962.  The pieces cover a wide variety of topics, ranging from appraisals of the works of  Twain, Joyce, and Hemingway, through the rewriting of the Bible, to the  decline and fall of the English language.  One theme, however, is paramount  throughout: the influence of Mass Culture on High Culture.  Although  Macdonald sees this conflict stretching back for two centuries, it greatly  intensified during the 1950s.  (One can only imagine how he would perceive  the situation today.)  No longer were art and thought the exclusive  province of an educated minority.  As the masses became more and more  educated, prosperous, and politically aware, they also became increasingly  involved with the cultural scene.  That, unfortunately, resulted in a  vulgarization of the traditional (high) culture.<br />The Mass Culture  (\\"Masscult\\" is his term) is not really culture at all.  It is a parody of  High Culture, a commodity created especially for the marketplace.  It is  not simply unsuccessful or bad art.  Rather, it is non-art, even anti-art.   Masscult offers its customers \\"neither an emotional catharsis nor an  aesthetic experience.&quot; It asks nothing of its audience and it gives  nothing to them.  Its goal is not even entertainment, but merely  distraction.<br />Macdonald draws his distinctions between High Culture and  Masscult along subtle, yet easily understood lines.  The works of James  Joyce, for instance, were High Culture; the works of James Michener,  Masscult.  Chaplin and Welles were proprietors of High Culture; Wyler and  DeMille were Lords of Kitsch.  Picasso, as opposed to Norman Rockwell.   Early-Hemingway versus Late-Hemingway.  Rogers and Hart versus Rogers and  Hammerstein.  Stravinski versus Elvis.  Masscult is impersonal and ignorant  of standards, \\"totally subjected to the spectator.\\" High culture is \\"an  expression of feelings, ideals, tastes, visions that are idiosyncratic and  the audience similarly responds to them as individuals.\\"  High culture is  the expression of a singular, unique vision; the creation of an  artist.<br />Since this conflict between High Culture and Masscult had been in  existence for over two hundred years, why did it become a pressing issue  during the Fifties?  Macdonald sees this time as a period of increasing  sophistication.  \\"The West has been won, the immigrants melted down, the  factories and railroads built to such effect that...the problem has [become  one of] consumption rather than production.\\" The work week had shrunk, real  wages had risen, college enrollment had skyrocketed, and the country was  enjoying an unprecedented standard of living.  Money, leisure, and  knowledge-\\"the prerequisites for culture\\"-were more abundant and widespread  than ever before.  Consequently, the average person (Ortega y Gasset's  \\"mass man\\") had the ability and the inclination to partake of culture.   Unfortunately, the traditional High Culture, the avant-garde, was beyond  both the ken and the taste of the mass man.  He turned instead to something  that was more palatable and easily digestible, something that he could  appreciate, and even understand, with a minimum of exertion: Masscult.   This rise of the mass man coincided with the rise of television (the altar  of Masscult), the spread of the inexpensive, quality paperback book, and  the long-playing record, all of which slaved to bring Masscult to a vast  audience thirsting for kitsch.  <br />Macdonald believes the solution to the  problem of the spread of Masscult is an attempt to define two cultures, one  for the masses and one for the classes.  (By \\"classes\\" he means not a  social or economic elite, but an intellectual one.)  He believes that there  already exists a dichotomy between two cultures and it is in our interest  to keep them separate.  There cannot be a broadly democratic culture on a  high level, not because the elite forcibly exclude the masses, but rather  the great majority of people have never cared enough about such things to  make them an important part of their lives.  That is as it should be.  \\"Let  the masses have their Masscult [and] let the few who care about good  writing, painting, music, architecture, philosophy, etc., have their High  Culture.\\"  A truly elegant, if arrogant, solution.	2000-05-12
US	52983693	RHMMK85ESW9XJ	0882958828	887141026	The Rise of Big Business, 1860-1920 (American History Series)	Books	4	51	51	N	N	Brief, but comprehensive study	Glenn Porter's brief, but comprehensive survey of the rise of the modern, bureaucratic corporation is a solid introduction to the topic. It also contains a particularly fine review of the pertinent literature in the form  of a bibliographical essay. This would be an excellent starting point for  anyone interested in studying economic history in the late-nineteenth,  early-twentieth century period. <br />The first topic that Porter examines is  the nature of big business. He believes that it is particularly important  to understand how the giant corporations that evolved during this period  differed fundamentally from those that came before. Prior to the rise of  big business, most business institutions in America were small, frequently  family-run affairs; at most involving a partnership of a few men. They  relied heavily on the personal integrity and prestige of these men in order  to do business. These firms were capitalized in extremely small amounts  and, consequently, had low fixed costs relative to operating expenses.  Finally, they usually operated in limited, local areas and produced a very  narrow range of goods and services. <br />Big business, however, represented a  clean break from these traditions of the past. The new, large-scale  enterprises were usually corporations, rather than partnerships; frequently  characterized by a separation between ownership and control. These  corporations were often typified by an anonymous, impersonal quality; a  factor which contributed greatly to the public's mistrust of them. They had  massive capital requirements and huge fixed costs (a significant barrier to  entry which ensured reduced competition). Furthermore, they operated on a  wide geographical scale and provided an array of products. <br />The next  topic Porter looks at is the appearance and spread of big business. The  first major enterprise of this type was, of course, the railroads, which  achieved this status around 1860. This was a necessary conditionfor the  rise of big business, since it could not thrive without a basic  transportation system in place. The development of the telegraph  system-and, later, the telephone-was also crucial to its coming. <br />Once  these advances were in place, big business started to appear, slowly but  sporadically. The corporations generally evolved through one of two  methods: vertical or horizontal growth. A firm grew vertically by extending  its operations backward and forward along its chain of supply and  distribution. It would reach backward for raw materials and forward to the  final consumers. This allowed corporations control over every facet of the  production and marketing of their product. Horizontal growth, on the other  hand, was where different producers who were all engaged in the same  enterprise would join together to form a larger firm that served their  collective interests. Initially, horizontal growth was achieved through use  of the infamous, though short-lived, trust. This method was soon replaced  by the holding company and, subsequently, the outright merger. Companies  could, of course, integrate both horizontally and vertically, thus forming  truly large and powerful businesses. This is how such familiar firms as  Standard Oil, Swift and Company, Goodyear, US Steel, and American Tobacco  came into prominence. (Among the forgettable failures were American Glue,  National Starch, the United Button Company, and Standard Rope &amp; Twine.)  <br />By 1910, the industrial structure of the country had been forever  altered, giving birth to the modern American economy. This radical change  in society naturally caused great consternation in the minds of many  Americans. Porter likens it to Turner's beliefs about the closing of the  frontier. &quot;The coming of giant corporations seemed to signal the end  of an open, promising America and the beginning of a closed, unhappier  society.&quot; The chief component of this dissatisfaction, Porter  believes, was &quot;the fear that the new economic order was destroying  America's status as a land of opportunity.&quot; America had long been seen  as a place where every man had the potential to acquire a business of his  own, to be his own boss. With the advent of big business, the prospects of  this were severely diminished. <br />Despite these fears, however, Americans  gradually, if not eagerly, adapted to the new state of affairs. This  transition was aided by rapid economic growth which resulted in a steadily  increasing standard of living and a tremendous increase in the amount and  variety of material goods. The rise of big business also resulted in the  creation of a new role for government as &quot;watchdog of the private  sector.&quot; This was the spirit of progressivism finally exerting itself  in the corporate world; something which Porter believes it rarely did. He  views the rise of big business as not only being independent of the  progressive movement, but bordering on the inevitable. As such, it was not  so much a phenomenon of the Progressive Era as it was coincident to it.  <br />&quot;The Rise of Big Business&quot; is recommended to anyone interested  in American history since 1860.	2000-05-11

This is especially true when dealing with such loose categories as &quot;the Twenties,&quot; a term signifying much more than a mere decade. William Leuchtenburg has  taken this task to heart, though. He has written an entertaining and  insightful history of the United States during this period, with a few  years added on either end for context. <br />The title is, unfortunately,  somewhat misleading. The &quot;perils of prosperity&quot; indicates a much  grander theme than Leuchtenburg has undertaken. He makes scant effort to  link the prosperity that the nation enjoyed until 1929 with many of the  sub-themes he discusses in the book (e.g., the rejection of the League of  Nations, the Red Scare, the &quot;revolution in morals&quot;). He does  point out what he perceives as the pitfalls of prosperity, however. It  concentrated power in the hands of a &quot;business class with little  tradition of social leadership&quot; and invested world power in a country  unwilling and unable to accept it. Most importantly, &quot;it made money  the measure of man.&quot; <br />Leuchtenberg makes a solid argument connecting  America's entrance into World War I with her affluence. Between 1914 and  1916, American trade with the Allies nearly quadrupled from $825 million to  $3.2 billion. When faced with the threat of unrestricted submarine warfare  by the Germans-and the potential loss of billions in trade-America had no  choice but to declare war. (He does not suggest that this was the only  reason, but it was a compelling one.) <br />Leuchtenburg also convincingly  links American prosperity in the 1920s with the crash of 1929 and the  depression that followed. This was a decade dominated by  &quot;get-rich-quick&quot; schemes and rags-to-riches millionaires. This  phenomenon was most evident in the stock market. Stories abounded of men  who had parlayed their savings into riches, multiplying their money  hundreds of times. Indeed, in 1928 alone, the New York Stock Exchange  registered sales of over one billions shares, a fourfold increase over the  level of 1923. That same year industrial stocks gained 86.5 points.  According to Leuchtenberg, this wave of speculation was crucial for the  nation's continuing prosperity. In fact, he believes that &quot;by 1928 the  stock market was carrying the economy.&quot; A year later, of course, that  was all to end. <br />Also important in the book is the theme of transition.  The 1920s were a time of fundamental change in American society. Prior to  that, the nation was a predominantly rural, agricultural society that  placed great emphasis on tradition, religion, and basic values. It was to  quickly transform into one that was urban, industrial, secular, and  thoroughly modern in its culture, outlook, and morality. This was not an  easy transition either. Many Americans fought it tooth and nail, reluctant  (or, perhaps, unable) to accept the new reality of life in the United  States. This created conflicts-particularly between rural and urban  attitudes-that were especially prevalent in such issues as immigration,  prohibition, and the presidential elections. <br />Leuchtenberg's approach is  primarily social and political. He views the period with a detached eye,  seeking neither to defend nor vilify the Twenties. Due to the restrictions  of space, his treatment is necessarily brief and generalized in areas.  Overall, however, The Perils of Prosperity is an invaluable contribution to  the literature.	2000-05-11

Walter Mosley and Easy Rawlins, however, satisfy both of those criteria in solid fashion. More than that, though, this is simply a good, fun read . <br /> The setting is Los Angeles in the 1940s, probably the most fruitful noir time and place there is.  During those boom years of post-war expansion, a man could make a good living and even buy a place of his own. <br /> That's all that Easy Rawlins wants.  When he's laid-off, though, he can't make his mortgage.  He's going to lose his house and he'd rather do almost anything than that.  He finds, though, that he has to do more than he bargained for. <br /> When a mysterious white man offers him $100 to find a missing white woman, it seems simple enough.  Nothing, of course, is ever as it seems.  Rawlins quickly finds himself in trouble and there is no easy way out.  It takes a hardness that he tries to hide for him to come out alive. <br /> For a first novel, this book is very solid with a lot of personality.  Mosley captures a people and culture that we don't get to read much about.  Easy is a good, fresh character; one of the best new entries to the mystery scene in a while. <br /> This book is recommended to everyone who enjoys a good hard-boiled mystery, especially fans of Raymond Chandler, Dashiel Hammett, and Ross Macdonald	1997-08-26

After finishing it, I didn't really care if I ever heard of him again.   <br /> It's not that the book is bad.  It's certainly readable.  It is also entirely unexceptional, dull, and cliche, with flat characters and poor dialogue.  <br />  If you are interested in reading a book like this, I suggest you check out Lawrence Block, Robert B. Parker, or John D. MacDonald instead.  They are all far superior.	1997-08-13

(His most recent film is &quot;Ransom.&quot;)  They are gritty and dark; fine examples of modern pseudo-noir.  The book might be hard to find, but it's worth it for anyone interested in screenplays.  These are three of the best I've read	1997-08-06

Books	5	11	13	N	N	Thomas' Last is One of His Finest	Ross Thomas' last published book is typical of his output and agood place to start reading one of America's finest, mostunderappreciated writers.<br /> All of the classic Thomas elements are here: the brilliant opening scene, the quirky character names, the sly political wit, and, of course, plenty of great fun. <br /> The plot is too complicated really to describe in just a few lines.  Besides, it is more fun to read and discover it for yourself.  As you can expect from Thomas, it is inventive and unique, with plenty of delicious twists and turns.<br /> When Thomas died a few years ago we lost one of the true greats in the mystery/suspense--or, truly, any--genre. His body of work matches up favorably with that of any writer.  Each of his books deserves to be read and savored.  He is sorely missed.	1997-08-06

I mean that in a flattering way, too.  You probably wouldn't want to read through the whole book in one sitting, but a few pages worth kill time very nicely. <br /> You'll find loads of great facts, info, and trivia about your favorite movies, all done with humor and wit, and backed-up by the encyclopedia-like knowledge of the Movie Answer Man. <br /> If you check the fine print, you'll find my question about Strange Days	1997-08-05

The Song is You: A Singers Art	Books	5	4	6	N	N	The Man and His Music	Friedwald has written the best book to date on the musical   artistry of Frank Sinatra, the greatest interpreter of the   American popular song to ever step up to the mike.  This book   takes you behind the scenes, giving you the stories of how   the music was made; the songs, the arrangers, the musicians,   and, of course, the Man himself.  It's refreshing to read   a volume on Mr. Sinatra that rises about the sleaze, accusations,   and innuendo.  After all, whatever one thinks of his personal   life, the greatness of Frank Sinatra comes from his music.  In   that arena, he will forever be the Champ.   <br />   Ring-a-Ding!<BR>   David Montgomery<BR>   Webmaster of Jilly's West, The Web's Premiere Sinatra Site<BR>   [...]	1997-03-21
