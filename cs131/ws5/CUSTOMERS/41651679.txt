It is a large volume.  I purchased the new hardcover as I expected to keep it for awhile.  These are the old stories of Italy, both folklore and fairy tales.  If you're a lover of either of those two types of stories and want to learn more about the culture of Italy, I would recommend this book to you.	2005-09-24

That I was not even really interested in this novel is somewhat amazing.  There's some supernatural biker named Diesel who winds up in Stephanie's kitchen.  Big deal.  Half of Trenton has been through her apartment at one time or another.  She's on the trail of Sandy Claws who jumped bail.  Joe may trust Stephanie, but he's a little too cool for someone who wants to marry her when he sees her at all hours with Diesel.  This is the book where Valerie discovers herself pregnant and she pretty much vomits or shops throughout the book, with hysteria in between.  Either the book is supernatural or isn't.  I think some would call this novel schizophrenic.  It's too short to really pick up and get interesting.  Oh yeah, Stephanie has another car go up in flames.  Is that a surprise or what? I think this book fits in before or after To The Nines in the Plum Continuum.	2005-09-24

I often heard mention of Stephanie Plum in comparison to other fictional characters.  (For some reason, she is compared to Anita Blake.  Other than being a female bounty hunter, I have no idea why.)This is the first Stephanie Plum novel. I found myself intrigued and I couldn't stop laughing over some parts of it.  I plan on reading more!<br /><br />Stephanie is a down on her luck, former lingerie buyer, who has to take up a job with her skanky and kinky cousin Vinnie.  She is put on the trail of her former high school \\"boyfriend\\". (He seduced her behind a bakery counter in high school.) Morelli is a policeman who was framed for murder and is on the run to clear himself.  He winds up hiding out with Steph and protecting her too.  Stephanie's attractive, smart, and witty...much like most women would like to see themselves.  I'd appreciate a bigger bank account and a non-repo'd car myself.  Steph solves the car problem with \\"borrowing\\" Morelli's Cherokee, which winds up torched, but she's not in it at the time.  There are twists and turns, a few dead bodies, but \\"all's well that ends well.\\"	2005-08-09

I was a little intimidated to try some of his dishes.  I went ahead and bought the cookbook.  It can be intimidating at first because he basically tells it like it is.  Be prepared to shop extensively for his pantry items.  I don't know that I'll ever have all of these in my kitchen and I am fairly well stocked.  I did make some substitutions so shoot me! Once you get over the shopping, the recipes are wonderful.  They are quite simple and easy to follow as opposed to some celebrity chefs' cookbooks.  Even if you don't cook anything from this book, you'll learn something about cooking and food quality just from reading.  I did like the information he gave on buying \\"real\\" cheeses and such as opposed to the reduced-fat or fat-free varieties.  He said the real stuff has more flavor and you can use less of it.  He called fat-free cooking inferior.  I did find that by mostly sticking to the recipe (couldn't find everything specified) I was able to eat less because the flavor was quite satisfying.	2005-07-12

I tried some of her recipes from Food Network's website (look for Giada de Laurentiis or Everyday Italian).  If you're doubtful about purchasing the book, try there first. I finally decided to just buy the book instead of trying to keep up with what I printed.  I cooked Chicken Parmesan and prepared Affogato last night for dinner and they turned out great!	2005-07-10

This third installment in the Hollows does definitely clarify some of the threads from the first two novels.  I won't say that those threads are over and done with, but things look clearer.  One thing is certain...life in the Hollows is never dull.  The novel starts with a bang as Big Al is seeking to make good on Rachel's promise to be his familiar.  Rachel seems to get rather battered throughout the book.  She outdoes him and rescues his familiar for the past 1,000 years, a female elf named Ceri, short for Ceridwen.  Ceri winds up living with the elderly neighbor, Mr. Keasley.  Trent continues to look more noble than evil as his motives for selling Brimstone and dabbling in illegal genetics are shown in a different light.  Rachel also gets the impression that he likes her as more than a potential employee.  We see a very brief, but even then too long, glimpse at his fiancee of convenience.  Rachel saves Trent's life and almost dies while doing so.  I have a feeling that in the next installment, Trent and Ceri who are both elves will meet.  Ivy continues to struggle as Piscary's scion and her bloodlust.  Skimmer, Ivy's girlfriend from years back shows up and she happens to be Piscary's attorney which does make things awkward.  Nick looks like he's gone for good, but that's okay because he seems like a wimp.  Rachel's too good for him.  Now the best for last...Rachel finds herself being courted (and then some) by Kisten, which is a very good thing indeed!<br /><br />I love this book and I hated to see the end of it.  This is such a fun series that if the Hollows were a real physical place I might just move there!	2005-07-04

She appeared in Blue Moon and Hunter's Moon in cameos only, but she was definitely an \\"ice queen.\\"  Her secret Montana compound has been blown to bits, she's been reunited with her college boyfriend (whom she abandoned at her first transformation), and the biggest, baddest, and craziest werewolf has escaped during the destruction.  Elise was born a werewolf and has to take a serum she created to keep the beast at bay.  Mandenauer took her in as an orphan and had her raised by staff.  Mandenauer's relationship with Jesse and Leigh hurts Elise's feelings as he was always cold to her, even as a child.  Elise's former love, Dominic \\"Nic\\", is an FBI agent investigating some missing persons reports.  (Elise took them out as a werewolf assassin as they were some fairly evil individuals.) Elise ran out on Nic with no explanation when she first changed.  As there were the collectively psychotic werewolves in Blue Moon, the cannibalistic super-werewolf in Hunter's Moon, now there are the \\"witchy-wolves\\" in this one.  Oh yeah, and as in the past...they want to rule the world.<br /><br />Enjoy this werewolf tale!	2005-06-30

This is not similar to the Darkhunter novels.  Dela/Delilah comes into possession of a unique puzzle box and upon opening it finds Hari, a man who has been imprisoned there for 2,000 years.  A wicked magician imprisoned him there and took away his shapeshifting abilities.  For 2,000 years he has been a slave to the owner of the box, be it on the battlefield or the bedroom.  Dela is at first a minimally psychic person, but her power progresses.  She is part of an agency of supernaturally talented individuals.  She becomes Hari's mistress.  Dela she seeks a way for him to become a tiger once more and be free.	2005-06-29

The heroine, Princess Xylara/Lara, is a healer in the tradition of royal and kind-hearted females.  She is forced to deal with her inept half-brother who sits on the throne.  Her people love her and they despise their king.  Her brother Xymund is poorly battling the Firelanders.  Meanwhile, Xylara is tending the wounded from her people and the prisoners of war.  Somewhere in there, Xylara comes to the attention of the Warlord Kier and becomes the Warprize.  Xymund is treacherous and tells his sister that she is to be the slave of the warlord.  She is to be the Warlord's consort although she does not understand this until around two-thirds through the book.  There is no mistaking who is good and who is bad in this book.  It really reminds me of a mature version of a childhood fairy tale.  I am anxiously awaiting the sequel, Warsworn.	2005-06-21

Her daughter Savannah is focused on now and again.  A slight mention is made about Jeremy, Elena, and Clay from Bitten and Stolen.  Jamie Vegas, the necromancer, is also back.  The book isn't about them though.  This is about Eve.<br /><br />Eve has been painted as a good mother to Savannah, but pretty bad in every other aspect from her leaving the Coven, her affair with Savannah's father, her practice of black magic, etc.<br /><br />Eve is in the afterlife or at least a region of it ruled by the Fates.  The favor she asked to restore Lucas and Paige has been called in by the Fates.  She is being sent after the demi-demon, the Nix, who is inhabiting unbalanced individuals and making them into serial killers.  She's basically a ghostly bounty hunter.  There are angels and demons thrown in too.<br /><br />A good read and I'm glad that I read it.	2005-06-04

In South Florida, I visited Columbia and loved the food.  I purchased it to try something new.  The recipes are authentic with some background narrative woven in there.  The language is easy and you can follow the recipe without any problems.  Of the recipes I tried, most could be prepared from a well-stocked pantry, not necessarily a huge trip to the grocery store like some cookbooks demand.  There are some really great seafood recipes in here too.  You'll love the simple Cuban sandwich in here too.  I believe this cookbook is well worth the price.	2005-05-14

This volume in the ongoing Midnight Louie series is a strong novel with compelling characters and a complete plot which is comparable in quality to the preceding novels.  Temple gets roped by Molina into playing a teenager in a reality-makeover-pageant show in exchange for leaving Max alone.  Molina's daughter Mariah is a younger contestant.  Murder and mayhem are present as always.  Matt heads to Chicago seeking information on his unknown and supposedly deceased father.  Max is sort of on the sidelines, building up to something in a future novel no doubt, dealing with the magician retirees.  Louie is helping out Temple and is \\"reunited\\" with the Divine Yvette and her sister Solange.  The ever-perky Midnight Louise also arrives on the scene.  Max lurks around Temple's apartment, reminiscing, and wonders if it's all over.  Matt surprises Temple at the end, but you'll have to read it to know what he does.	2005-05-11

It was relegated to the shelf with the other cookbooks.  One day, I needed a recipe for something really Southern.  I looked everywhere, including the Internet, to no avail for a suitable recipe.  I found many classic comfort food recipes that were simpler than I remember.  Every recipe I tried has been great.  I won't give it an A+ for health though.  This is the full fat, full egg, full sugar version.  I will say this though, many healthier substitutes work well in this cookbook for like fat free dairy products, egg substitute, or whole wheat bread.  I even tried Splenda in these recipes and you couldn't tell a difference between it and sugar.	2005-05-11

Aisling seems to have some of the worst luck and a flippant tongue, which constantly gets her in trouble.  There are some humorous moments and you mustn't take the novel too serious.  (The details, grammar, etc. are good so don't mistake me as saying the author doesn't write well.  She's just a funny writer.) The attraction between her and the wyvern (dragon lord) Drake is quite obvious.  (What's not so obvious is why he puts up with her other than chemistry.)  This book lacks the depth I prefer in my reading, but it's one of those quick uncomplicated books you could read just fine in an airport or with a toddler wandering around.  I'm undecided as to whether or not I will purchase the next installment.  The ending was rather abrupt, just as it was with the first one, with no closure.  If you just think of this as a ramble and that this is just a piece of a bigger piece, you're okay.  It's a fun read and will give you a pleasant respite.	2005-05-07

I am finding the Sookie Stackhouse novels to be very entertaining and amusing.  They are a hybrid cross between romance and the supernatural.  This book brings some of the other secondary characters from previous novels back in and then some.  Sookie is dealing with Eric who still doesn't remember their tryst, but seems to be figuring it out.  Bill seems concerned, but knows he's pretty much out the door.  Sam is shot which brings in Eric's bartender as a sub.  Alcide the werewolf is flirting around with Sookie and visiting now and then.  Entertaining and light hearted.	2005-05-07

Training a Siberian Husky is quite a challenge considering the personality of a Siberian. They are playful, independent, and intelligent. You have to take these traits into consideration and go from there. Treats are about the only motivator I have found to get one moving and I don't mean the ones from the grocery store. Very smart, a Siberian will work if she wants to work or provided there is a benefit. If you own one or are thinking of getting one, please read this book. Siberian Huskies for Dummies is also a good choice as well. This book is very short with concise instructions. I think even a mature teenager could manage to train with this book.	2005-05-07

I studied this during my 30 minute lunch break for around 2 months and I passed both tests the first time.  Not only did I pass them, I exceeded the required scores.  Grammar was never my strong suit so that must say something about this book.  I found the examples explained little idiosyncracies of the language that had always stumped me.

Some knowledge of Spanish is very helpful as you'd need to know how to pronounce the words to play the games. Some of these games seem rather old-fashioned and I don't think many modern children would like them.  Consider those a history and folklore lesson.  There is some background given on some of the traditions.  This book seems to be extracted or have used the same research as Mexican American Folklore published by August House.  This is not a book with quick and easy directions as it is more of a reading book.  If you want to teach your children songs and games in Spanish, I'd choose another one.

I think this is just one of the best Spanish books for children.  It's simple, but can teach a wide vocabulary for the bilingual toddler.  I think you and your baby would have fun with this book.  The pictures are colorful and interesting as well, unlike many Spanish books out there. (They look kind of cheap and that's not good considering they usually cost more!) This is a winner in my house!	2005-03-03

I have all the Sneaky Pie Brown books and the two preceeding foxhunting novels.  I will say I liked it less than the first two in the series, but we all can't bat 100% all the time.  The reviewers who didn't like said the author was rather preachy in parts and you could tell this in certain parts of the book, but as I hold some of the same opinions, it didn't bother me.  You have to have some flexibility as the dogs, horses, and all the other animals know each other and have conversations with each other.  You'd really have to be into dogs, especially foxhounds, and foxhunters to get the fullness of this novel.  It's a good read nonetheless.	2005-02-27

I am a diehard Anita Blake fan and I suffered through Cerulean Sins and now this? The first books in the series were so much better.  Anita was still a believeable fictional character.  There was an actual plot, denouement, climax, and conclusion.  This is thinly veiled pornography with Anita as some sort of supernatural vixen who has to go to bed with practically every man she meets because of the ardeur.  I won't part with the first novels through Blue Moon.  I even liked Obsidian Butterfly, but this is to the point of ridiculous.<br /><br />Don't bother buying one new.  I can't believe I purchased this in advance.  Check out one from your library or check out an online auction.  My copy's on eBay and I really hope to part with it soon.  I think I'll be moving on to another author.  Promising authors are Kim Harrison and Kelley Armstrong.<br /><br />Sorry, Laurell.  I love your earlier books, but I can't handle Anita's current state.  Can't we have her wake up from some really bad dream and find the last 2 books were non-existent?	2005-02-09

His alpha sends him away on a mission to a kill a woman he's never even met.  This bad #$@ is a fan of Rachel Ray and is convinced if he could smell her up close he'd have confirmation that she's really a werewolf.  Supposedly the reincarnation of the evil Morgan Le Fey has no idea that she's supposed to be evil.  The novel just sort of chugged along and didn't have too much zip.  I guess if I'd read the other books in the series, I might have felt differently.  Maybe I should have taken it more lightheartedly.  It's too cutesy to be a book about a werewolf and a sorceress.  I like my novels with more substance and definitely more of a bite!	2005-02-08

Zarek, now an Olympian, despises his legitimate aristocratic half brother and blames him for the horrors he endured as a Roman slave.  Valerius seems to be the only decent one aside from Zarek in the entire family.  Valerius witnessed Kyrian's execution at age five by his father and grandfather.  There are some definitely bad feelings all over.  On top of all that, Valerius is a Roman and the majority of the Dark Hunters are Greeks so they hate him and give him a really hard time.<br /><br />Tabitha, Amanda's twin who is married to Kyrian, gets involved with Valerius.  Tabitha is the \\"wild one\\".  She's very outspoken and unconventional.  The demon Desiderius is back in town or sort of...I think he was a vengeful ghost that his son sought to resurrect.<br /><br />There are losses on both sides, literally.<br /><br />The mystery thickens as to what/who Acheron really is.  I won't spoil it for you, as the details would give the rest of the story away.<br /><br />I recommend this book, but be prepared for some definite moments of sadness.  It's not as painful as Zarek's story, but there are flashbacks to that as well.  There is a happy ending though!	2005-02-08

This book while simple and has fifty strategies is really for professional educators as the \\"lingo\\" may not mean the same to a non-teacher.  The strategies employed could be used in even a regular/mainstream classroom, especially if you want to do something a little different.  This is not the most thrilling book in the world, but then again, neither are lesson plans.  I used it for ideas more than anything.	2005-02-08

This book focuses on Regeane, a misunderstood and orphaned noblewoman, mistreated by her relatives, who happens to be a werewolf.  She has fought the wolf part of herself and has not really come into her power.  She is a pawn in a huge powerplay which could effect the entire Empire or at least what's left of it.  She meets Maeniel from Night of the Wolf.  In human form, neither knows at first that the other is a wolf.  The book goes from there and sees justice for Regeane as well as happiness.	2005-01-25

Maeniel has brought his mate Regeane and his pack into dealings with humans.  They are the alphas of the pack.  The setting is at the end of the glory of Rome and chaos abounds.  Maeniel is a powerful and very wealthy lord now and his fortress is in a very important location.  His cooperation with Rome is needed.  There is more focus and background on the secondary characters than in the other two wolf pack novels, but they never shadow Regeane and Maeniel.  Too bad this is the last novel about them and their pack to date.	2005-01-25

These are not those monsters you see in so many books and movies, but powerful and elegant creatures, for the most part anyway.  Alice Borchardt's protaganist is Maeniel, a werewolf.  This focuses on him and his pack, of which he is the leader.  (He is connected to Guinevere the Warrior Queen in Ms. Borchardt's other books.)  A great deal of research on ancient Rome was done as well.  The details is incredible and sometimes not for the squeamish.	2005-01-25

I was just so impressed by his professionalism and realism.  He was not trying to press textbook situations on real-life families.  (I am a psychologist, by the way.) He uses common sense.  Dr. Guarendi is clearly an expert on child rearing both professionally and personally.  I would recommend any of his books, but this one especially.  Discipline is so important and overlooked by many parents, until it is too late.  I did not like the question/answer format of this book which reminded me of Dear Abby.  While the information is very good and useful, it's rather awkward trying to locate particular information due to this format.  Dr. Guarendi's other books are also worthwhile and some of the information is covered in them as well so looking at them may be of interest if you have a specific issue.	2005-01-18

I read a lot of werewolf fiction and I was so impressed with this book.  If you don't read another werewolf book this year, then check this one out.  The werewolves here are not portrayed as victims or sexy creatures like a lot of other novels out there of this type.  They are very real and very scary.  It's suspenseful, well written, and has a surprise ending.	2005-01-18

I found it to be a page turner, combining romance and mystery.  The characters are compelling and the story keeps you guessing. I was surprised that her heroines from the other preceeding novels, Joy and Allegra, didn't appear with their were and vampire spouses.  I also thought initially this book would be about the young Guardian from the second book.  Katie Macalister has obviously done her research into the paranormal as she seems to have the lore down pat.  (I'm not a practitioner, but an avid reader.)  This is apparently the first in a series with the protaganist, Aisling Grey, and the ending literally leaves you hanging.  It wasn't one of those that leaves you in anticipation.  It was so abrupt, you ask yourself what happened, was that the ending? It's pretty bad considering the next book won't be out until May.  It's like the entire story was written and someone chopped it right down the middle or something.  We're still somewhere up around the peak in the plot and the book is over.  (In a side note, I must prefer her paranormal romances to the \\"normal\\" ones.  I purchased a couple of the others thinking they would be as likeable as Sex and the Single Vampire and A Girl's Guide to Vampires.  They were not.  I found them quite dull and considering the volume of romance novels I go through, that says a lot.  I'm not talking about sex either.  The characters nor the plot never really clicked with me.  I highly recommend her paranormal novels.)	2004-12-21

Of course, they are both beautiful and come of from dysfunctional families, which seems to be typical of romance novels.  I did love this book though.  The characters all meshed together rather well.  Obviously the author is familiar with hockey or did a lot of research.  Well done!	2004-09-13

While the book was quite entertaining, it was not what I expected.  The male \\"hero\\" is a great guy, but the female heroine is quite neurotic.  I think any real guy would have given up on her, but not Michael.  I had trouble connecting with Theresa.  I'm not sure why.  Theresa's initial rejection of Michael in the book has to do with an attempted rape by a fellow teammate of Michael's.  Somewhere in there, she decides that he's her type because he's Italian.  Well, so is she!  There's also this loser lawyer who is in the way and trying to take advantage of Theresa.  I did like the book as a whole and I'd read another novel by Ms. Martin.	2004-09-13
