First, unlike most (all?) of Debbie Macomber's books, this book should not be classified as a romance.  Instead, it's women's fiction.  It focuses on women in various stages of life and realistically deals with their problems (it acknowledges that, hey, unlike some reviewers [apparently], not all women are so hardened that their life-changing problems are easily curable in 200 pages).<br />Second, this is an enjoyable read.  The characters develop nicely, and the reader gets to know the characters well.  Macomber includes enough secondary characters to make the plot interesting, but not so many as to be too confusing (trust me, it is confusing enough straightening out the 4 main characters in the beginning of the book).<br />Third, Macomber's themes are well-done.  Each character picks a word at the beginning of the year to be her theme word, and I was thinking, \\"Great!  Now we have to deal with these themes over and over again.\\"  But Macomber is much more subtle and uses these themes effectively and very un-battering-ram-like.<br />I did have two small problems with this book.  First, it seemed that the ending was a little abrupt.  I'm not sure if this was because of how the book was set-up: the book plunked us in the middle of the women's lives and carried through for months while we got to know these characters.  When the book ended, it seemed unnatural to stop reading while the characters' lives continued on.  Second, the first diary entries in the first chapters are distractingly obvious attempts to set up each character and her history.  Would a person really succinctly write their pertinent life story in an on-going journal for only her own personal reading?  This is unnatural, and I found it rather weird.<br />However, on the whole, this is simple and enjoyable women's fiction.  I recommend it as one of Macomber's best efforts yet.	2002-06-27

I got hooked on Jo Beverley's books back in the early 1990s when she was writing the small regencies.  There, she focused on bringing light romance to a good story.  Then, she moved into the heavier material.<br />This book is the perfect example why Jo Beverley's \\"Sensual\\" romances are only the genteel ladies' substitute for a porn movie.  It was quite obvious that Beverley was not focusing on the plot of this book and putting romance into it.  It seems that she simply wrote a few skanky sex scenes and put them in a book with a sketchy plot (with every contrived plot twist imaginable to let the characters have pre-marital sex, and lots of it).  The characters here are harsh, bitter, and unlikable, especially the heroine.  They deliberately hurt each, when they are not making vulgar and over-the-top suggestive remarks to each other.  This is supposed to be romance?!?<br />However, this is Beverley and not as bad as many other similar books in the genre, thus saving the book from only one star.  However, this is a very skippable book, even if one wants to read the Rogues and George series.  Just check the book out at the library, read the back, read the first and last chapters, and move on to the next books of the series (that at least have some plot wrapped around the sex scenes).	2002-06-10

This book is not fun and it is not escapism.  Although the plot is interesting (woman, daughter of foreign diplomat, married to peer by proxy and sent to England and pursued by evil henchman from foreign country), the characters simply make this piece fall apart.<br />Neither the \\"hero\\" nor \\"heroine\\" are at all likeable.  The hero is a jerk.  He bullies his wife around, refuses to stop sleeping with his mistress, and generally acts like a cad while he tries to seduce his wife.  The heroine, we are told, is a spunky, independent thinker, but we have no evidence of this.  In fact, the heroine is supposed to be enamoured with politics, but isn't, and fights to change the role of women, but doesn't.  She wrings her hands and blames herself when her new in-laws are incredibly rude to her.  She claims to dislike her role as a female, but she has absolutely no talents at all, wifely or not (no wonder her husband gets exasperated with her).  And, she is fighting her attraction to her bore of a husband, but immediately capitulates when ever he touches her and she feels that \\"spark.\\"  To add to this mess, the secondary characters are inconsistent and stupid.<br />And the end of this book, I was relieved it was over.  The promising plot set-up gets the 2 stars in this review.  The writing, the characters, and the action make this book worth only one star.  I recommend that you leave this book on the shelf and try some of Ferguson's other efforts, which are at least amusing.	2002-05-22

The hero and heroine are likeable enough and the secondary characters add extra dimension to the story.  However, the main problem with this book is that it is often boring.  While reading this book, I kept wondering where it was going and when the pace was going to pick up.  Although there are some exciting action scenes towards the end, they seemed out of place and added only to give the book a semblance of a rousing conclusion.  I even thought that the romance between the hero and the heroine was rather mundane.  Overall, I would recommend this book for a pleasant enough waste of time, but this isn't an exceptional romance and it has a rather placid plot development.	2002-01-21

Restorative justice, the most recent idea of change for the criminal justice system, is based on--and advocated by--many major religions.  This book has a chapter written by different people from each religion who write about the religious support for restorative justice in that religion.  The book addresses restorative justice in the context of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Aboriginal theories, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism, and Chinese culture.  Each chapter is entirely self-contained, so you need only read the chapters you are interested in.  Although written for academics, most of the text is understandable by the average reader interested in restorative justice.  I highly recommend this book for those interested in theories of criminal justice and for those interested in how the different religions view restorative justice.	2001-11-01

But of her four published books (including &quot;The Nobody,&quot; &quot;Falling for Chloe,&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Christmas&quot;) &quot;Fair Game&quot; is her worst book.  The story plot is fine (although I admit I don't like the force-to-be-the-mistress-till-we-fall-in-love plots), but the characters are lacking.  The heroine, Clarissa, is sweet and poignant, but it takes awhile to really develop her beyond a passive ninny.  However, the &quot;hero,&quot; Trevor, is a jerk.  He is dishonorable, unlikable, and unattractive.  Thus, the attraction between the two was unbelievable: she falls for this guy even though he has so little respect for her that he cannot stop scheming to get her into bed regardless of the number of times she tells him she's not interested.  What part of &quot;no&quot; don't you understand, Trevor?<br />Although I never liked (or respected) Trevor, I did grow fond of Clarissa by the end of the book.  That, well-drawn secondary characters, and the very smooth writing moved this book up to 3 stars. However, I recommend any of Farr's other books or short stories over this one.	2001-10-30
US	51100165	R2DG5QRPULUD9T	0373834926	926710912	Take 5 Volume 1	Books	2	9	9	N	N	Just a really dumb collection	I think I would have given this book the dreaded 1 star, except that a few of the stories are halfway entertaining.  Halfway.  Mostly, this collection of five short stories is abrupt, undeveloped, stupid, and boring.  Here is a short run-down of the five stories and my take on them:<br />&quot;Yesterday once more&quot; by Debbie Macomber is about a woman who walked out on her fiancee years before and is now back in town to make amends.  Because his mother is dying, they enter into a marriage of convenience.  This story is dumb!  The hero is a jerk; the plot is contrived (how many people do YOU know that are in a marriage of convenience?); the whole piece is stilted and abrupt.<br />&quot;Adam's image&quot; by Debbie Macomber is about an ugly doctor who meets a beautiful woman.  He has an inferiority complex; she pursues (i.e., stalks) him because she fell instantly in love with him.  Although a little better than &quot;Yesterday,&quot; the characters are undeveloped.  He acted like a complete jerk to her throughout the story, the source of his angst is adequately not explained, and then they resolve everything in a paragraph and live happily ever after.<br />&quot;Roomful of roses&quot; by Diana Palmer is a story of a wounded overseas reporter who has returned to his old sweetheart's house to recuperate.  He commences to turn her life upside-down.  In this story, at least the attraction between the characters is well portrayed.  However, I thought the hero was a domineering jerk, and, like the other stories, the story was abrupt and undeveloped.<br />&quot;Woman hater&quot; by Diana Palmer is a story about a Montana rancher who falls for the secretary of his brother.  This was the best of the stories: the dialogue between the main characters was witty, refreshing, and honest.  However, Palmer crams too many plot twists into her story--the characters seem to be running here and there trying to keep up with the action of the story.  Also, there are too many undeveloped secondary characters in the story who just don't advance the plot.  This needs to have been at least a novella, if not a full-length book, to accommodate the secondary character development and the plot developments.<br />&quot;Always a bridesmaid&quot; by Patricia Knoll is a &quot;Wedding Planner&quot; story.  There must be a lot of desperate wedding planners out there who are constantly falling for the groom.  In this one, add a &quot;surprise&quot; ending, and the whole thing is wrapped up.  Knoll says she tries for quirky humor and interest characters, but they weren't found here.<br />These short stories are fine if you want absolutely forgettable romance.  All of them had potential to be amusing novellas or full-length books, but were incomplete as short stories.	2001-09-26
US	51100165	RQRV8ZRMQ0RB7	0821746332	696764930	The Traitor's Daughter (A Zebra Regency Romance)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	A good story that falls apart	I like Joan Overfield's Regencies.  Her characters are usually very real and likeable.  This book started that way, with very likeable characters and an intriguing plot.  However, about half-way through, the whole thing just fell apart.  The heroine started acting very stupid and naive (not trusting the hero, falling for obvious traps of the villian--unlike the very self-sufficient and competent woman we meet at the beginning) and the romance got very silly (it gets hot and heavy and then very unromantic as the hero becomes a clod and a jerk).  Also, the villian emerges as the plot progresses, and although the author doesn't confirm who it is, there is only one suspect...and guess what?!?  It's him!<br />Joan Overfield is much better than this book.  For much more coherent fun, read &quot;The Journals of Lady X&quot; or &quot;A Spirited Bluestocking&quot; or delve into &quot;A Door Ajar&quot; and &quot;Time's Tapestry.&quot;	2001-07-07
US	51100165	RQHJ0YQ9KGNAW	0821768077	739770669	A Kiss For Mama (Zebra Regency Romance)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Hit and Miss	These three stories are a tribute to mothers, although only the first one involves a biological mother.  The first story, &quot;The Dowager's Dilemma&quot; by Jo Ann Ferguson, has a cast of wonderful and likeable characters.  However, the plot quickly becomes disjointed and confusing.  Characters behave ways that are not explained and make no sense.  Also, it often seems that Ferguson cut phrases or scenes to shorten the novella, and the plot seems hacked apart.  I would give this story 3 stars.<br />The second story, &quot;A Mother's Devotion&quot; by Valerie King, is simply awful.  The characters are unlikeable, the plot terribly contrived, and the whole thing is boring.  The two main characters proclaim to be in love, but don't even seem to like each other.  The secondary characters are annoying.  The plot has huge holes in it (e.g., where is the children's father and what did he do that was so terrible?).  This story only deserves 1 star.<br />The third story is the best one.  Although it really didn't involve a mother, the characters are wonderful and the emotions believable.  This one involves two main characters who grow and change while they fall in love with each other.  The secondary characters bolster the story without overshadowing it.  The only problem with this story is that it is too short: it could have been a full-length book.  I think this story deserves 4 stars.<br />Overall, this wasn't bad for a book of Regency short stories.  The second story by King can easily be skipped, but the other two by Ferguson and Savery are enjoyable reads.	2001-05-07
US	51100165	R3EHW3I9G85HOP	0821762079	960040532	My Lady Mischief (Zebra Regency Romance)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Witty and Enjoyable	If you are like me, you have found that Valerie King's regency books are either hit or miss.  This book is definitely a hit.<br />The characters are lively and likeable (and actually like each other!--such a refreshing change from many regencies).  The plot is forward-moving and never boring.  The romance is excellent, with great sexual tension.<br />What I found most intriguing with this book is the political philosophies expressed.  Ms. King plays with her characters' idealogical views and gives a realistic opinion to the hero and heroine.  The hero is a classic liberal (autonomy and individualism) and the heroine is a classic civic republican (social justice through community efforts).  The issues they address are historically accurate but still relevant to today's political discussions.  Ms. King cleverly integrates these political views into her story and shows the pros and cons of each position.  Only at the end of the book does it seem that she sacrifices her characters' solid political leanings for a feel-good compromising ending (and hence why I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5).<br />Overall, however, I recommend this book.  The subtle political discussion makes the book extra interesting, but the book also can stand alone on its characters, plot, and romance (if you are not in the mood to delve into a political debate and just want a good story).	2001-01-26

She  heads to London to find out who this dastard is she is supposed to be  engaged to.  Simon, Lord Emsley, newly returned from the war and the new  marquis, is also confused by the announcement and is determined to discover  this obvious fortune hunter who he is supposedly engaged to.  When the pair  meet, sparks fly.  Simon is determined to stay engaged to the fascinating  woman, but Damara is tired of having her life run by dictatorial men.  The  course of true love has quite a few obstacles to overcome in this  delightful romance!<br />This book is one of my favorite regencies!  All of  the characters, including the secondary characters (family members,  friends, and villains), are marvelous and true throughout the book.  The  plot is forward-moving and believeable.  The writing is great prose, a fun  read (with laugh-out-loud sections).  I highly recommend this book.	2000-09-18

The characters  (especially Lord Nightengale itself) are absolutely enchanting and the  adventure keeps moving.  I laughed aloud at Lansdowne's witty prose.  An  extra bonus with this book is that unlike some of Lansdowne's books  (notably &quot;Amelia's Intrigue&quot; and &quot;The Bedeviled Duke&quot;),  the romance here gets just as much attention as the adventure parts of the  book.  I highly recommend this book and look forward to the next three  books of this &quot;trilogy.&quot;	2000-09-04

As the &quot;Secret of the Mansion&quot; started  with only Honey and Trixie figuring out the mystery, in this adventure only  Trixie and Honey are off to Minnesota with Regan to check out an Arabian  horse farm.  However, strange things start happening on the farm and Trixie  must determine if the ghost of a cattle-stealing ruffian is to blame or  someone much more human.<br />In this book, we have a resurfacing of the  anti-development themes first introduced in &quot;The Sasquatch  Mystery&quot; and the &quot;Mystery at Maypenny's.&quot;  But we also have  Honey and Trixie acting pretty ridiculously to aid a ghost-hunter and  search out the legend of the ghost.  The mystery in this one was probably  the most predictable of all of the books (there is only one suspect) and  the book was so short that very few plot twists had time to develop.   Although I like Honey and Trixie the best, I must admit that I missed the  interaction of the other Bob-Whites.  Overall, this book is a must-read for  a Trixie die-hard, but a very disappointing ending to an otherwise  fantastic series.	2000-08-17

The gang heads off to a  &quot;pirate&quot; inn run by Miss Trask's brother.  However, strange  things start to happen with the appearance of a glowing, ghostly ship and  the disappearance of their host and his cash.  The gang must sift the real  clues from the numerous red herrings to save the inn and figure out a  two-century-old mystery.<br />The characters are again wonderful, and Kenny  keeps the plot moving.  However, the relationship between Trixie and Mart  is odd here: Mart's jokes / taunts are downright cruel, yet no one seems to  stop him, including the Belden parents.  Perhaps this is simply  reemphasized by Trixie's unusual emotional fragility (she seems to burst  into tears at the slightest provocation).<br />But, on the whole, this book is  a fun mystery and a fun read.	2000-08-07

Trixie and Honey, et al, decide to  organize a bikeathon to raise money for the school art department.  But  several people don't want the bikeathon to continue, including Honey's  messed-up cousin Ben Riker, the school's best artist Nick Roberts, and a  person who leaves mysterious notes around threatening the bikeathon.  Add  to that a counterfeiting ring and Sleepyside is wide awake over this  mystery.<br />This one was fun to read, as all the Trixie Belden's are.   However, the mystery was lacking here because Trixie never investigates  this one (and doesn't get into her usual trouble).  Here are some other  small problems: Jim has turned into the paternal figure and constantly  speaks condescendingly towards Trixie; by this book the time line is  officially out of whack (the kids are back in school for one whole book);  every character in the book insists on acting obtuse.  On the flip side, we  have a great scene where Honey and Trixie have to reevaluate their  friendship and Ben Riker reappears in the series (at least, I wondered what  happened to him).<br />I recommend this one as a great tie-in to the series.   Try to ignore the small problems and enjoy!	2000-08-04

The problem is that this one is a tie-in for the other books but really isn't a mystery at all.  In fact, the whole mystery is cooked up in  Trixie's over-active imagination.  However, it is a must read to tie the  series together and it does help further develop the characters.  Question:  why is Trixie so reluctant to pretend to be interested in Jim when she  dresses up like a lady, when, two books later, she IS interested in Jim  (peculiarity on the author change, I guess)?	2000-07-28

This time the gang is off to the seashore for 10 days of &quot;relaxation.&quot;  But, before the first day is over, Trixie is  knee-deep in a new mystery.<br />This one grabbed me from the beginning.  Unlike adventures #7-#12, this one is written by a &quot;new&quot; Kathryn  Kenny, and she infuses the series with the life that was dying out by #11  and #12.  I laughed out loud at the humorous lines (very similar to Julie  Campbell's delightful prose in the first 6 books) and the characters were  true throughout (we even get a few sparks flying again between Trixie and  Jim).  The mystery is more of an adventure than a criminal-chasing  frenzy.<br />If there is any drawback here, it is the small details that are  inconsistent with the other books, especially in the recaps.  This author  mixes up who did what in previous books and this is the beginning of the  frustrating &quot;temporal flux&quot; (where the various authors cannot  keep straight what time of year it is and who is what age in relation to  everyone else).  Also, this author has left Dan out of the adventure.  That  guy just always has to work and never gets to have fun with the rest of the  Bob-Whites!	2000-07-28

Though this book is probably better than most Silhouettes, it falls short of Roberts' usual excellence. This book is the  most lacking of the MacKade series. By this fourth book, the MacKade plot  is so predictable: girl meet guy, because girl and guy are opposites they  have sparks, girl and guy sleep together, problems arise, girl and guy  sleep with each other in a &quot;different&quot; way (i.e. torrid first to  tender second), girl and guy realize they're in love by how they made love,  dramatic scene, happy ending.  In this book, the ever-so-charming Shane  introduced in the previous books is missing his charm and is rather  boorish.  Add to that a mediocre (and goofy) ghost subplot and a very  disappointing epilogue that's doesn't even draw in of the previous  characters! You simply do not have the high standards of the normally  excellent work of Nora Roberts with this book.	2000-06-28

In this culmination of the four-book series, Sheila Rosalynd Allen wraps up the loose ends of her &quot;Ghost&quot; series. &quot;The  Passionate Ghost&quot; takes place chronologically one year after &quot;The  Helpful Ghost&quot; and again the Abbey is taken over by a new owner.  However, the new owner's last name is the same as the resident ghost's and  other similar strange connections surface. The book pulls in characters  from the previous books and flashes back forty years to tell the story that  sets the context.<br />Again, there are small problems that make this book  less than five-star. The romance is lacking; Ms. Allen concentrates more on  wrapping up the entire story instead of working out a realistic plot. Other  small plot inconsistencies make you sit up and think, &quot;Wait a moment!  That's not right!&quot; (i.e., how the heroine knows the ghost's name  though she was never told).  And the ending is ridiculously abrupt.<br />On  the other hand, &quot;The Passionate Ghost&quot; has Ms. Allen's most  compelling opening chapters of any of the books.  And the characters stay  consistent and likeable throughout the book.  The book does nicely wrap up  the entire plot and explain most of the questions lingering from the  previous books.  Overall, it is a satisfactory conclusion to a very fun  series.	2000-06-28

This time, Sir Harry,  the Abbey ghost for lovers, must join together the two daughters of the  house with their true loves. But to do this, Harry must overcome a dearth  of class conflicts. The clashing between the lower, middle, and upper  classes makes this book a true Regency comedy of manners. However, small  inconsistencies in plot (i.e., why one daughter sees Harry before she even  meets her true love) and poor editing (at least in the paperback  copy--missing quotations marks and words misspelled [doak instead of  cloak?]) prevent this from being a five star book. Look to &quot;The  Passionate Ghost&quot; to conclude this fun series.	2000-06-27

Although this book takes a while to get going, the characters are charming (especially the irritated but  earnest Harry) and the plot is fun.  Harry must bring together the  granddaughter of bitter Lady Agatha (who has been dumped on by every man  she ever knew) and the man who bought her home from under her.  Sheila  Rosalynd Allen's (aka Sheila O'Hallion) writing is especially strong with  the dialogue and the believeable romance.

The Abbey has been empty until a Steadford cousin, Giles, moves in to recuperate from his war wounds (the  reason the Abbey is given to him is implausable at best, but we will accept  it and move on).  Since he isn't recuperating, the local doctor arranges  for a nurse to help him out.  Elizabeth soon becomes his nurse and physical  therapist to get Giles to walk.  The romance is believeable and the reentry  of Sir Harry as a (rather inept) matchmaker is humorous.  The situational  humor from visiting Londoners is also enjoyable to read.  Move on to next  two books, &quot;The Helpful Ghost&quot; and &quot;The Passionate  Ghost,&quot; for more fun with many of the same characters.	2000-06-26
US	51100165	R1MSC6J3IUZEYH	0380775417	496454281	The Mercenary Major (A Regency Romance)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Fun and well-done	Frankly, this book was fun to read from beginning to end.  The heroine, Victoria, is determined to save her neighbor's aunt from an imposter claiming to be the aunt's nephew.  But the more Victoria gets to know Jack,  the more she doesn't care who he pretends to be as she falls in love with  him.<br />The characters here are very likeable.  The hero and heroine  actually LIKE each other and complement each other well.  And the plot  keeps moving and forward action.  My one criticism is that Ms. Moore uses  historical facts of spy plots and uprisings in London without giving us  enough background to figure out what is going on (actually, there seems to  be a conspiracy theory presented that is never explained).<br />Overall, fun  reading--recommended!	2000-06-19
US	51100165	RE3GQWVU4XWQI	0802710603	699920111	Current Confusion	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Stilted	When I began to read this, I was delighted to see that this was the forerunner to Carola Dunn's &quot;Byron's Child&quot; (one of the best time travel Regencies I have read).  But this book quickly lost its appeal as I  read along.<br />The premise is that physicist Dr. Cassandra Brown gets zapped  back in time from 1989 to 1815 Regency London where she encounters Lord  Font, a amatuer scientist himself.  They must join together to send  Cassandra back to her own time.  But the plot simply falls apart here, and  the writing is stilted and unengaging.  The author does not seem to have a  good grasp of physics to make this believable (it would be better to make  vague references and let the reader presume the characters know what they  are doing).  And there is absolutely no romance or even sexual tension  between the hero and heroine.  The cross-cultural encounters elicit a smile  at best and just aren't nearly as amusing as they could be.  Last, the  changing of significant aspects of the past and the lack of change in the  future and the bouncing back and forth of the characters adds to the drawn  out inplausibility and boredom of this book.<br />I would stick to Grey's  &quot;A Regency Valentine,&quot; where she writes several short stories  with Jo Beverley's fabulous characters.  Or, go back to Carola Dunn's  &quot;Byron's Child&quot; for a fun time travel with a much better  treatment of Grey's characters.	2000-06-10

Ms. Ferguson offers appealing characters and a credible romance.  The contrived plot is what keeps this from being a truly excellent book.  The heroine  distains the season because she is searching for her lost brother.  But  somehow she turns abrupted to allow all three gentlemen involved in the  wager to court her seperately.  And then there is the government, which  denies that her brother is still alive, but secretly knows he is a prisoner  of war.  Why would the government hide this?  It would actually be in their  best interest not to mess with the peerage's inheriting structure and mess  up the title system with their denials.<br />Overall, the strong characters  make up for an inherently weak plot and make this a pleasant read.	2000-05-08
US	51100165	R38SJREHSANR80	0821760483	824640173	Viscount Victorious (Zebra Regency Romance)	Books	2	10	11	N	N	Historically inaccurate and unlikeable	From the first page of the book, I was wincing.  The hero of the story is a viscount, the younger brother of an earl. Glaring mistake #1: only direct descendents ever received curtesy titles (i.e, the eldest son of the earl)  and younger brothers never received curtesy titles because they could  possibly be stripped of the title when the earl had a son (there is a  reason behind all of this). Also in the first chapter, the mother of a  baronET is referred to as a baroness. Glaring mistake #2: these are two  completely different ranks and are addressed differently. Ms. Solomon, look  at your peerage rules before putting it to paper. There are more glaring  historical mistakes (i.e., Havana cigars), but I will leave those off. I'll  go on to tackle the plot and characters.<br />The hero is quite good, fun and  romantic. The minor characters were also interesting. But the heroine was  annoying: she alternates between intelligence and extreme stupidity. For  example, if you were stuck in a carriage with a lecher about to rape you,  would you wring your hands and hope for the best or would you bash the guy  over the head with your silver chess set and try to get away? Guess what  our heroine does. And then as the story progresses, she cannot even  recognize her own true love when he is unmasked. Other acts like these make  me wonder about the heroine.<br />As for the plot, it is contorted and drawn  out. This book is a Regency, so this in itself is not the death of the  book. However, certain things get left out: why the heroine is so poor if  she had a glorious [expensive] season just the year before (her loss of  fortune is not explained), where certain minor characters disappear to  (such as the heroine's governess and the villian's mother), why the earl's  change of heart is so sudden, and where the earl's first love ever came  into the story. I cannot help but think that these are all plot contortions  so that Ms. Solomon can manipulate her story past all semblanceof reality.  Add to that that this plot gets drawn out way past the point of viability.  You know how it has to end, so end the book at 200 pages (when it  natureally concludes) instead of 250 pages (where it groans to a  halt).<br />Last, the writing style is often awkward. I noticed several  misplaced modifiers (though ridiculously funny, are distracting) and  misused words (the heroine &quot;disdained&quot; the vicar's offer of tea,  instead of &quot;declined&quot;). Oddly, once in a while the author  completely jumps out of the story and refers to herself telling the story  or &quot;you&quot; as the reader. This works only when used consistantly  and often enough so that the reader gets used to it as part of the style,  but Ms. Solomon only uses this technique 3-4 times and it just doesn't fit  the rest of the 3rd person, objective narrator.<br />If I were you, I would  leave this book on the shelf. If I were Ms. Solomon, I would research the  Regency time thoroughly before attempting another book. If I were Zebra  publishing, I would get an editor that recognized Regency customs and could  correct occasionally poor craftmanship.  And if I were me, I'd try to  forget I ever read this book.	2000-05-08

The writing is excellent and the characters are consistent and likeable, but the plot is incredibly old and worn out.

But, this collection is really quite good.<br />Of the three stories, Judith Lansdowne's &quot;The Parson's Mousetrap&quot; is the most delightful with loveable characters and great writing.  And I was  especially delighted when Ms. Lansdowne broke the mold in two ways: her  heroine is older than her hero and her hero is a good, honorable cleric!   Thanks so much for not bending to the tired plot lines, Ms. Lansdowne!  I  thought Marcy Stewart's &quot;The Enchanted Bride&quot; was the next best  about a young lady swarmed with suitors and fiances days before her  wedding.  The characters were delightful and the final &quot;magic&quot;  twist at the end is priceless.  Third, but still quite good was Valerie  King's &quot;The Bride's Gift&quot; was about how the heroine tricked the  man she loved into marrying her until it starts to unravel when he  discovers what she did.  I thought the whole story could have been about 10  pages if the heroine had just told the truth, but the story as written is a  fun read.<br />All together, these short stories were a pleasant diversion.   For excellent longer reads by the same authors, check out &quot;The  Bedeviled Duke&quot; by Lansdowne, &quot;The Golden Heiress&quot; by King  (aka Sarah Montrose), and &quot;Darby's Angel&quot; by Stewart.	2000-04-29

I read it in two days and lost a lot of sleep simply because I could not put the book down.  It was worth it.<br />This book is actually a compilation of the 8-book series &quot;Winds of Light,&quot; previous  published separately, and tell the ongoing saga of Thomas, an orphan boy  who believes it is his destiny to conquer and rule the small kingdom of  Magnus.  The book takes place in 1312-1314 in England, but travels to  Europe and the Holy Land as well.  Throughout his travels, Thomas learns  about himself, his friends, God, power, society, knowledge, religion, and  trust.  The book keeps moving with constant conflicts internally and  externally.<br />When you read this book, it is helpful to remember that it is  a compilation of 8 books.  Every once in a while the author goes back and  recaps what just happened, and you know that this is where the books were  joined together.  However, I actually found this quite helpful in keeping  the story straight in my head; after 550+ pages of material, the recaps  keep the characters and numerous plot twists in order.  Also, when you are  finished with the book, make sure to read the historical notes in the back.   The depth of Brouwer's research is mind-boggling!<br />Overall, I highly  recommend this book.  A great story, great characters, and great historical  context make it a magnificent book.	2000-04-25

Fortunately, she has the counsel of Sir Roland, her father's friend, to steer her through the hard  times.  Sir Roland decides that since the young duke is 19, it is time for  him to go to Oxford to get an education and time for Charlotte to pamper  herself.  But first, a calculating school miss's schemes must be thwarted  and a newcomer's gentle presence cultivated.<br />This book is simply boring.   Though Charlotte and Roland are supposed to be the main characters, Ms.  Donley spends no time on them and all of her time on the secondary  characters, including the brother, his flirts, Roland's sister, and her  flirt.  There is absolutely NO developing romance between the main  characters, though we are supposed to believe so by the end.  In addition,  none of the characters are very compelling and the plot adds no additional  excitement to the mess (the main conflicts are wading in a pond  unchaperoned and stealing/borrowing a bonnet--all done by secondary  characters).  Charlotte, especially, comes off bad in the beginning as she  is perceived as a managing, whining woman (though her image improves as the  book progresses).  The 19-year-old duke acts like a confused 13-year-old  going through puberty and not like any a normal young man I've ever  encountered.  The dialogue is stilted, and I only recognized the  &quot;funny&quot; parts when the characters laughed at their own jokes.<br />I  think that this book deserves 2 stars and not one simply because the  writing style is not so bad.<br />When it was all over, I simply didn't care  what happened to the characters or the plot.  I finished it today, and I  hope that this book remains only in my short term memory and then fades  completely from my consciousness.	2000-04-18

The plot is so out-there that I kept reading only to see if reality would ever enter in.  It didn't.<br />Let me sum this up: our heroine is a cat.  No, really.  For  her ninth life, &quot;Fate&quot; makes the black cat Georgina a woman (this  phenomenon is explained in ONE sentence blaming &quot;Fate&quot; and we  have to accept this without any more plausable explanation).  She is found  unconscious by the dead body of her previous master by Lord Seybourne (a  pardoned murderer who is secretly innocent because his evil twin did it),  who decides to marry the beautiful unknown brunette (yes, on the cover of  the book she is very blond, but in the book she has black hair).  There are  several funny parts as Georgina learns how to be a woman and not a cat, but  that cannot make up for the rest of this book.  Seybourne marries the lady  on the next day (no one questions this), his former mistress comes to the  wedding (no one questions this), Seybourne single-handedly must solve the  murder (no one questions this), and off they go to a houseparty for the  exiled queen (no one questions this).  Sum the book up with a fantastic  abduction plot and assistance of wild cats and you can wrap the whole mess  up.<br />I thought this book deserved 2 stars simply because the writing style  is so smooth.  However, the plot and characters and whole premise of the  book is so ridiculous, I'm wondering how this got past the editor's  shredding machine.  Take my word on this and leave this book on the  shelf--don't waste your time.	2000-04-17

It seems that Catherine cannot stay in one  place and Max cannot keep his mind off his lovely guest.

The characters are fun and likeable, especially  the servants and Jemmy, the boy Catherine befriends.  Chase does a  wonderful job showing the progressing romance to prove how these opposites  can believably attract.<br />If you can find a copy of this book, grab it and  read it right away.

Clean and easy to read and  very forward moving.  The characters and plot are also fantantic and  compelling.  Both characters are likeable, but still have to learn about  themselves.  The plot has some interesting twists so that (even though I  knew how this regency had to end) I was tensing while I read to figure out  how it would all come out.  The content also shows the author's  comprehensive understanding of classic literature (although I missed quite  a few of the references simply because I didn't have such knowledge) and  even explains in the author's note where she took historical liberties.<br />I  highly recommend this book.  It is a spin-off of Rasley's &quot;Royal  Escapade&quot; but stands completely on its own merits.	2000-04-15

Marjorie Farrell has an excellent grasp of the English language and is very easy to read.  Unfortunately, this book's ease of  reading isn't its problem.<br />The book opens with Harry and his friend James  going on a walking tour of Yorkshire during the middle of the season.  They  hit a freak snow storm and are forced to seek shelter at a country home.   They are befriended by the two lovely daughters of the house, Lynette and  Kate [see where this is going?].  Then everyone goes to London for the  season and then to Padstow to see a May Day celebration.<br />Farrell cannot  seem to decide who her hero or heroine is.  She flip-flops between the two  sisters.  Lynette must struggle with the terrible problem of being  stunningly beautiful.  Kate must struggle with the problem of being  completely uninteresting.  Harry spends much of the book mooning over  Lynette though he is supposed to be in love with Kate.  James just is.   Furthermore, there is absolutely no chemistry between any of the characters  [but by the end, I really didn't care].<br />When the book isn't going through  the boring lives of the characters, it is trying to force some action  through external means and it just doesn't work.  The plot remains  extremely boring and forgettable.<br />Trust me when I say that the good  grammar cannot make up for a terrible book and uninteresting characters.

I couldn't read all of this book because my copy had been mispublished.  Double check to make sure that page 161 (and not 129) follows page 160 through page 192.  But I will review what I read: the  beginning and end.]<br />I enjoyed this book.  It was not super great, but it  was amusing.  The premise of the book is that Fane Westby comes to England  to search out the father he thought was dead.  Turns out his mother had  fled with him when he was a baby and just recently he learned he was the  heir apparent to an estate.  When he arrives in England, he meets the  tenants at the dower house, Miss Marietta Hampton and her delightful aunt,  who have both been banished from the rest of the family for being too  free-thinking.  Enter an evil villian and you have the plot.<br />The  characters are very delightful and have some depth, especially the aunt and  Fane.  The writing is well done and clear.  But the plot twists and some of  the set-ups are so contrived that you know it could only happen in a novel  (Fane only knows one other person in England who happens to be his deadly  enemy and this enemy happens to be in the same obscure villiage? ).  Also,  the plot starts out very, very, very slowly, though it picks up nicely in  the pages right before the publisher misprinted it...er, I mean, right in  the middle of the book.  The ending is, of course, happy and  resolved.<br />This book is enjoyable.  Just make sure your copy is whole and  unblemished prepare to turn off your mind to any attempt at plot reality.	2000-04-06

When her older brother gives up on the search after one day,  Ada decides she will have to find her brother.

The summary seems to indicate this is about a earl who wants to farm who runs into a young lady tenant and things happen from there. If this was the plot, I would have been much happier than what actually came out.<br />Max indeed wins an estate in a card game and goes off to see his property. But first he arranges to have a house party of his rakish friends and ladies of the night join him. When he arrives, he finds the house has two tenants with an unbreakable lease. Since the two are ladies of quality, Max &quot;nobly&quot; decides to divide the house in half and keep the other tenants' presence a secret. As the house party unfolds, Max learns more about himself and his &quot;friends&quot; and finds love with Hope, the lovely young tenant.<br />This book is simply fraught with problems. Max is very unlikeable, especially when he doesn't have the backbone or honor to cancel the house party but lets it continue. This image of Max is never completely dispelled, even when he begins to mend his ways. Hope comes out as a self-sufficient, smart lady but doesn't have the brains to investigate the circumstances that have robbed her of her fortune. Even though the writing is very good, it just cannot make up for the lack of the plot. The sexual references are embarrassing to both the reader and the author's talent. And the confrontational climax about dastardly deeds and hidden agendas is absurd and out of place.<br />This book had great potential. But Ms. Lane simply didn't carry it through. I would recommend skipping this book and finding something else to read that might be enjoyable.	2000-03-27

This book has so much going for it.<br />The best part of this book is the writing: clean and  smooth. Ms. Claybourne proves she is a master of the English language with  all of its nuances. Another positive of this book is its strong, likable  characters. Colin's consistently kind behavior makes him a model hero  (though his reputation tries to convince us otherwise, we cannot believe he  is anything but kind). Third, the plot keeps moving through the various  problems the characters encounter and comes to a very satisfactory ending  at the right time (as opposed to ending abruptly or being drawn out past  the plot's viability).<br />This book had a few problems, though. First, Ms.  Claybourne hasn't yet nailed down the Regency pecularities. For instance,  when I was reading this, I was struck by the fact that the characters are  allowed to run about unchaperoned and unchecked (more so than the  circumstances demanded), in violation of the rules of the upper classes.  Also, I thought that later sexual inferences/comments, though never  explicit, were rather vulger and out of place with the gentle romance  presented at the beginning of the book.<br />On the whole, though, this was a  thoroughly enjoyable book to read. I look forward to reading other books by  this talented author.	2000-03-27

The characters are engaging and likeable (or thoroughly unlikeable if they are the enemies).  The romance is realistic even though the mystery  really isn't (basically every character that is introduced throughout the  book plays some part in the climax, which is terribly unrealistic).   Personally, I liked the fact that the hero and heroine had great sexual  tension and that they were honest with each other.  The plot is not driven  by the stupid lies and misunderstandings between the hero and heroine that  drives so many other regency plots.	2000-03-08

It has interesting characters and good writing, but the whole thing just doesn't do it.  Perhaps it is because the plot backfires on itself.  The premise of  the book is that 18-year-old Eliza wants to show her 40-year-old father  that his being smitten with a 19-year-old girl is wrong.  She does this by  getting involved with a 38-year-old war hero.  Then, of course, Eliza and  March, the war hero, get together.  The underlying problem is that the  author convinced me that these May-December romances are wrong: this is the  equivalent of a high school senior and a middle aged man.  This is  emphasized by the heroine's extreme immaturity (what we are supposed to  perceive as &quot;innocence&quot;) and the hero's somber gravity.  Add to  that that every character is trying to teach the other characters  &quot;lessons&quot; through deceit and artifice.  By the end, I was  thoroughly sick of the whole mess, though everyone forgave everyone else  and the whole thing wrapped up in literally one page.<br />Sorry, but this  book isn't worth your time.	2000-03-03

However, I thought I should say that I didn't really care for this book.<br />      I must concede  that the characters were dynamic and very well depicted.  I found this more  so for Delilah than Dragoner.  In fact, the opening impression of him is  that he is a real sleazeball, and that image is hard to shake throughout  the book, no matter what he does.  If he really is merely misunderstood,  why does his jerkish behavior come off so convincing to everyone?      <br />I  thought that the plot was very slow and plodding.  The main characters  dwell for interminable amounts of time on the mess they have made of their  marriage.  When the action picks up 2/3rds through the book, it seems  unreal.  I won't give the ending away because that would ruin it for you,  but I read the whole end with complete disbelief at the sheer  implausibility.  At least the beginning, though slow, is realistic and  often insightful.<br />      Overall, this book has great characterizations,  but a slow, plodding plot and, in the end, an unrealistice ending.	2000-03-01

Unfortunately, it really doesn't have a plot.  The plot given on the back  of the book is resolved in the first 50 pages of the book and the rest of  the book is left to resolve the growing romance between Aurora and Kenyon  (and the other couples that predictably get together).  However, I had the  impression that next 170 pages were really driven by Kenyon trying  ineffectively to bed his wife, not to develop a romance.  Though the  Metzger comedy rises above this plot deficiency, it leaves an unfulfilled  ending when the book is done.  For a truely great Metzger Romance, go back  to &quot;Lady Whilton's Wedding&quot; and &quot;A Loyal Companion.&quot;	2000-03-01

The story concerns the building of the Cherokee hospital and Mandie and her friends are trying to discover who is sabotaging the project.  The learning lessons Mandie must discover are again good  here.<br />I had some major problems, though.  The book (unlike the others)  has a overwhelming condescension theme toward the Cherokees: the white  people must come in to solve the mystery and the Cherokees sit around  wringing their hands.  Also, Mandie's parents let their daughter get away  with all of her misdeeds, disobedience, and whining and let her run around  with dangerous terrorists in the neighborhood.  Sound like normal, rational  parents?  Last, the mystery is obvious and insults the meanest  intelligence, especially that the adult characters cannot figure it  out.<br />Overall, this book is a necessary tie-in for the rest of the series,  but not up to the caliber of the other Mandie books.	2000-02-25

The story is indeed inspiring and a wonderful tool to expose  children to the horrors of the holocaust without being traumatic. For a  Newberry Award winner, I was a little disappointed: I was just getting into  the story when it abruptly ended, skipped a couple of years to the end of  the war, and summarized the &quot;happy&quot; ending. I would have  preferred to have more detail of Annemarie's experiences during the  occupation. (Also, the younger sister was too &quot;cutsy&quot; and very  annoying.) However, on the whole, this is one of the best children's  fiction books on World War II in Europe, second only to &quot;Journey  Through the Night&quot; by Anne De Vries relating the Dutch experience.	2000-02-25

I read it when I was in grade school and have tried to reread the series at least once every few years.  However, as I do not own the series, I must interlibrary loan  it or borrow it from people who do own it.  [This review can also double as  a plea to the publisher to republish the series.]<br />This series was  originally written in Dutch by Anne De Vries and was translated into  English and published in Canada.  The four books are: (v. 1) Into the  darkness (v. 2) The darkness deepens (v. 3) Dawn's early light and (v. 4) A  new day.<br />The series traces the German occupation of the Netherlands from  1940 to 1945 during World War II.  The books are seen through the eyes of  John De Boer, a Dutch teenager who grows up during the war and assists in  the resistance movement.  Filled with suspense, intrigue, and harsh  reality, the series protrays what life was like during the war.<br />The books  are written for middle school ages and up.  The prose is easy to read,  though not simplistic.  A parent may want to read along with a younger  child because parts of the books can be very emotionally disturbing.	2000-02-14

As the previous reviewer mentioned, the characters were awesome--I could easily picture each person as they were introduced in the story.<br />The plot  is simple.  No elaborate death threats, war issues, or madmen running  around.  That's okay, because it stands just fine on its story.<br />If I had  any problems with this book, I found it to be a mite slow at points.  The  characters indulge--in my opinion--in too much introspection.  &quot;Stop  thinking and act!&quot; I wanted to yell at them.  Some books err on the  side of no-brainer characters; this one tends to err on the side of  too-deep-of-thinking characters.<br />Overall, a very good book.	2000-02-02

They should be shot after they are forced to actually read the book.  The back has nothing to do with  the book.<br />Okay, got that out of the way.<br />This was another Ghost Rider  romp from Sigmund Brouwer's fine pen.  The western aspects again were  excellent and historically accurate.  The mystery was good, although easier  to figure out as a reader than the previous Ghost Rider books.  I did like  the fact that Sam gets out of Wyoming and heads to a different state to  uncover another mystery and more attempts on his life.<br />I cannot say too  much without giving away the entire plot.  So I won't.  I will add my one  criticism of this book: Brouwer wraps this one up much too quickly.  It  seems that he ran out of space in the book and had to quit with the whole  thing in 10 pages.  Quick! Explain the mystery, sort out the characters,  get home, and add a happy ending!  The ending was too abrupt and too  unsatisfactory.<br />So, all together, this was a good book of a great series.   I recommend the entire Ghost Rider series.	2000-01-27

I'll agree with the previous reviewer that this one was depressing, so I recommend that you have book 4 (&quot;Thunder Voice&quot;) ready to read when you finish book  3 just to lift your spirits.  However, please do not skip this one because  of the unhappy nature of the plot.<br />This is the best mystery of the  series.  Sam Keaton must figure out why there is a dead man in his  sheriff's office, a tradegy stricken expedition, and a massacre of women  and children.  The plot adds more great characters, reintroduces old  favorites, and twists along to the end conclusion.<br />What makes this book  great is the struggles of the hero.  Sam must deal with the guilt of his  actions and his failed responsibility to others.  In addition, he has a  very realistic battle with alcoholism, a struggle that makes him so much  more of a real (imperfect) person.  Sam's humanity and the struggles of a  real person to find a higher purpose make this the best book of the Ghost  Rider series.	2000-01-05

He ends up chasing all over Wyoming and Colorado to sort out the whole mess.  The plot is excellently  written so that the reader can discover the clues and put them together  just as Sam is doing.  In addition, this book adds great characters like  the Doc and Jake and explains more of Sam's past.<br />Again, Sam seeks to  uncover deeper truths.  However, the truths he discovered in the first book  don't seem to have been absorbed and he relearns half of what he should  have already figured out.  That can be a little tiring, but generally it  isn't so bad.<br />Finally, (perhaps I just did not get it) but the title of  the book absolutely baffled me.  Sure, it's referred to once or twice, but  it didn't seem to fit with anything else.  This irked.	2000-01-05

That is apparent from the very beginning as he narrates this western suspense.  However, just how involved is his past comes to light as the book unfolds.  Sam has to travel with a  silent Indian in search for a treasure he's not sure he believes in.  Along  the way, he uncovers a mystery and must unravel the whole mess and try to  stay alive in the meantime.<br />If you want a realistic, gritty western  novel, this is it.  The mystery is incredible, involved, and yet  understandable.  And Sam struggles with the very questions of life: he  touchingly questions his existance and the purpose of life in a poignant  and down-to-earth manner.  Although this is a Christian novel, there are no  easy &quot;pat&quot; answers.  Brouwer leaves the underlying questions for  the reader to struggle with also.<br />Here are the pluses of the book: great  / realistic characters, suspenseful mystery, deep and engaging life  questions, incredible western background and thorough research apparent,  and a steady reading pace with virtually no slow parts (it was hard to put  it down most of the time because every time something was resolved,  something else came up).<br />However, there are some minuses: sometimes the  writing gets too cryptic to be understandable, the coincidences tying every  part of the past with the book's present stretch the reader's imagination,  and the romance (in my opinion) is abruptly added.<br />On the whole, this  book is wonderful.  It was my first Sigmund Brouwer book and it didn't  disappoint.  It is a great introduction to the Ghost Rider series and had  me grabbing to read &quot;Moon Basket&quot; (Ghost Rider #2 of the 4 book  series) (&quot;Sundance&quot; is #3 and &quot;Thunder Voice&quot; is #4).	2000-01-02

The  characters are again wonderful, and the detail and vivid imagery surpass  any of the previous books.  Even the romance and sexual tension are evident  and well done.<br />I might have given the book 5 stars except for two  problems.  First, Ms. Poore drops a significant part of the mystery midway  through the book (I don't want to give too much away).  Second, the climax  and ending are too abrupt.  There is an exciting pace set and within 10  pages, the whole thing is wrapped up tight.  Wham, bam, thank you,  mam.<br />However, read the previous books and happily end on this one.  This  book definitely is the best one of the series and leaves us with a good  feeling and some unforgettable characters.	1999-12-16

In fact, the  denseness of the heroine can become really annoying in the middle of the  book.<br />However, this is the first of four books with the same characters  and a running subplot between these characters.

Instead of jumping way ahead of the heroine, the reader actually figures  out the mystery at the same time.  However, still be prepared to get rather  annoyed at the heroine for being obtuse frequently during the mystery.  The  plot moves to London instead of Brighton and does not follow the same  pattern as the other two, keeping this book from descending into  unimaginative drivel.  Also, the book contains some real funny plot twists  involving a replication of many Cairo Cats.<br />For romance lovers who missed  a real relationship in Ms. Poore's previous books of this series, the  romance begins to heat up between the hero and heroine.  The sexual tension  makes the book better reading by keeping the main characters  interesting.<br />The series definitely improves with this one.  Look to  &quot;The Mummy's Mirror&quot; for a completion of the series.	1999-12-15

Dauntry is a wonderful hero and the heroine is realistic and loveable.  I describe the  romance as &quot;quiet&quot; : no fireworks or unrealistic events to throw  the hero and heroine together but only a simple romance that works  well.<br />The book would have been five stars except for two small drawbacks.   First, Dauntry's &quot;Dilemma&quot; comes at the end of the book and  really isn't explained why he is having his mental anxiety (sorry, but I  don't want to give too much away to those who haven't read the book).   Second, the ending pages are very cryptic.  Perhaps I just didn't get it,  but I thought the end was too sparse and I had to reread the last several  pages before I figured out what happened to everyone.<br />On the whole, great  characters and a good plot.

The book, though entertaining, does not require much brain power.  It's definitely not one of Macomber's best.<br />I was perhaps most disappointed in the characters.   The impetuously-witty-and-yet-often-ditzy-blond heroine, the  unrequited-love-but-I'll-sleep-with-someone-else-to-chase-away-the-demons  father, the  happy-when-with-daughter-but-unhappy-inside-although-I-did-it-to-myself  mother, and the typical-hardened-lonely-noble hero.  Even the drug smuggler  was a stereotype and the wicked villian was obvious from the first.  It  seems that chance, fate, and pure idiocy on the part of the characters  create most of the action, and it doesn't work.<br />The biggest  disappointment was the ending.  The climax--a big, exciting action  scene--was resolved 80 pages before the book ended.  The last 80 pages  wither away as the hero and heroine finally come together after literally  months apart.

In addition, Macomber spends too much  time catching her readers up on her previous stories in a summary each time  the major characters from those books are introduced.

The delightful romance promised by the back cover cannot carry the rest of the dragging plot through.  The biggest disappointment was the characters: the hero is thoroughly  unlikeable and almost out of the regency mindset (what kind of  &quot;gentleman&quot; would attempt to seduce a virginal lady?).  The  attempted interaction of the town people falls flat on its face, too.  The  few flashes of wittiness cannot make up for the wholly uninspiring content  of the story.<br />By the middle of the book, I just wanted it to be done.   But I was on vacation with nothing else to read, so I finished it off.  The  ending makes up, perhaps, the rest of the book.

However,  there are about 16 words on each page in 22 point font.  I felt as though I  was reading a child's book instead of a romance novel.<br />Second, the author  needs to brush up on her Regency period facts.  Any good Regency editor  should have caught all the mistakes this book presented.  For example, what  is a notorious scandalous actress doing at a ton party?  C'mon!  It  couldn't happen!  Also, any girl like cousin Harriet would long be  ostrasized before her behavior was tolerated.<br />Third, this book is  terribly written.  The author TELLS, not SHOWS.

The heroine is inconsistently shy, sassy, bold, demure,  fiery, passive, loving, hating, you name it.<br />If you find this book, leave  it where you found it (probably in the trash).  The book is a waste of  paper and your time.	1999-10-22

The plot has a tendancy to drag.  The characters, especially the hero and the 2 sisters, tend to be one dimensional.  The heroine is more interesting, but  I found her annoying at times.  She runs hither and yon, refuses to talk  out her problems with the hero, and suddenly makes an about-face and begins  to like him.  Last, there are too many abrupt about-faces in the  characters.  A deferring wife bows to her husband for 20+ years and  suddenly stands up to him and he allows it?  A little reality here.	1999-10-22

Although not spectacular, it is amusing.<br />The plot keeps moving.  The paranormal aspects of this book are tolerable, but actually distract from the rest of  the book.  The hero and heroine are fun and likeable, but I found the  smaller roles a bit annoying.  The lesser characters dropped in and out of  the plot without any reason.<br />If you find this book at the library, read  it.  If you think you should buy it, don't.	1999-10-22

However, the set-up of the books ruins each plot.  The reader must wait until then end of the book to find out what happens to each  character, and it is more frustrating than suspenseful.  I recommend having  someone who read this book tell you which page to jump to after you read  each short story.	1999-10-22

Throughout the book, Collum tells us what each of her characters think (you are in the minds of no less than 6  characters), tells us why they do what they do, and tells us what we should  think of her characters.  The characters remain static and undynamic--what  you read it what you get.  Ultimately, the writing is stilted and  pedantic.<br />The plot is a good one.  In fact, I think it is excellent.  The  main characters advocating for their chosen heiresses.  Unfortunately,  there is an inherent plot hole in this book that you could drive a truck  through: why doesn't the inheritance get split between the 3 candidates?   It seems so obvious to me, but it took the author 200 pages before she  considered it.<br />The one redeeming factor of this book is the dialogue.  If  you can, read the dialogue and skip the rest.  In 30 minutes, you will have  read what was worth reading.	1999-09-15

Metzger craftily weaves her plot of two people who need each other and find their hearts' desires during the Christmas season.<br />I am enchanted withMetzger's zany characters and witty style.  The characters are likeable and fun. <br />If you can get a hold of this book, I guarantee it will be an asset to your regency library.	1999-09-14

If you haven't read &quot;The Fortescue Diamond,&quot; &quot;DeLacey's Angel,&quot; and &quot;The Lady and the Spy,&quot; start by reading those wonderful books.  Then proceed  with this one.<br />The characters here are awesome!  Although not all of them  are likeable, they are remain true to character.  The plot keeps moving and  the description of people and events are wonderful.<br />Monique Ellis proves  again with this book that she is one of the best regency writers in the  market today!	1999-09-14

Barbara Metzger shines through with two of her classic regencies reprinted in this combo book.  The first, &quot;An Affair of Interest,&quot; has a loose plot and it's hard to get into.  How, the Metzger wit shines through.   (I'd give this one 3 stars.)<br />The second, &quot;Luck of the Devil,&quot;  is one of my Metzger favorites.  Definitely a 5-star book!  This book is  perhaps one of Metzger's most bittersweet.  Again, the writing is superb,  but also one of Metzger's most emotional books.  I find myself holding back  a tear each time I read it.  Yet, somehow, the raw emotion this story  evokes makes this tale a poignant classic.<br />Any which way, I highly  recommend this duel book.<br />By the way, Barbara Metzger didn't write  &quot;Sir Sham&quot; or &quot;Heart on His Sleeve.&quot;  Marion Devon  wrote those.	1999-09-14

This delightful novel marks another triumph for Monique Ellis.  The characters are likeable and fun as are the adventures in the book.  This book had two slight drawbacks: (1) too much of the book was spent on the  adventurous parts compared to the developing romance, which made the latter  improbable; (2) the long-suffering patience of the heroine was stretched  too much (I wanted to do violence to several of the villians and couldn't  believe the heroine's foreberance).  However, on the whole, this book is a  keeper.	1999-09-01
