It is ok for a very high level overview hence the 1 star but falls flat for major details on the individual HA features. Instead my advice is to get The Oracle 9i RAC book from Rampant Press, Oracle Streams book and Oracle Data Guard book all from Rampant Press and read the Oracle concepts manuals for these HA features.	2005-09-07

Also a very senior Oracle DBA consultant who interviewed me  a year ago suggested that I study it to get senior DBA job. Overall an excellent text- clearly written packed with tons of very useful tuning information and of course the cute photo of Mr. Larry Ellison when he was 22 years old and looked like a pencil geek  rather than the gazillionaire today. My only beef- NO CD-ROM or link to ANY of the scripts or tables for the book! This is frustrating guys because when I try to follow along with the tuning examples in the book I cannot duplicate same results to see how the tuning is performed. Other than that gripe a highly recommend it to Oracle DBAs. I also like the sections on X$ tables- few places actually discuss this and its nice to know how the X$ tables interact with Oracle kernel and Operating system. <br /> <br />Best chapters to me were Chapters 6-9 on using native Oracle trace and tuning tools like tkprof, sql trace and stored outlines. Chapter on index tuning and tuning SQL queries and joins really my favorites as few places discuss this. AND just be advised all you DBAs- managers and senior Oracle guys will tech you out on very very difficult tuning questions so study and review this book before and after interviews to land job! Along with Guy Harrisons SQL tuning book and Richmond Shee's tuning book on Oracle Wait interface the best three tuning books ever written for hungry DBAs. When users scream and yell that they cannot run a report these will save your job.	2005-08-21

The first few chapters are priceless from Oracle history to the useful read on Oracle tuning using Wait events. I really enjoyed learning how the product evolved from inception to the new version of 10g. All in all money well spent and nice to know that even such gurus as the Oak Table guys are human and have shared tough DBA experiences. Someday I want to meet and work with these guys!	2005-07-18

Good complement to online support for real Oracle DBAs.

I like this a lot and together with the Oracle documentation, setting up and using RMAN is a snap compared to the pain it used to be to stumble with RMAN before. Throw away logical backups and hassle of SQL backups and use the power of RMAN. I was able to get cooking in a few hours with a good RMAN setup for our test and production database environments. Together with the Oracle 10g RAC book you have the complete knowledge to be a true HA Oracle DBA.	2005-03-29

I have to rank this book even though it covers Oracle 8i it still is applicable, after all 99.99% of customers and companies with Oracle are STILL on Oracle 8i and have not even touched 10G yet I would definitely get this book along with Practical Oracle 8i: Building Efficient Databases by Jonathan Lewis, Oracle One on One by Tom Kyte and Oracle 8i DBA Handbook then you can become a real Oracle guru. No other book covers such a wide range of topics on Oracle in the clear succint method that this author does. Now cant wait for an Oracle 10G title soon.	2004-10-19

My only beef with it is that it is kind of lacking on some aspects of martial arts such as chi development and training tools. The only other aspect that annoys me is how it refers to martial art styles such as Choy Li Fut in a weird romanization of translation such as calling this style Cao Li Fun when nobody except for a Cantonese speaker would ever call it this name. BUT with that  said overall I highly recommend it as an excellent supplement to your serious wushu training.	2004-06-15

Like another reader commented its not how to get OCP/MCDBA whatever certifications but actually will make life better in the long run as a serious DBA pro. I now actually understand the basis of complex database topics such as cursors, data models, and concurrency/locking topics that previously are skimmed over in other books and training guides. Best book for a beginner and yeah its a bit dry and academic but CJ Date writes clearly. A MUST FOR SERIOUS COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENTS!	2004-04-02

It cuts to the point without wasting pages explaining what DB2 UDB is. Excellent for when you need to implement complex backup and recovery or if your database crashes at 2am you will be thankful to have this critical reference. The other books for the most part on DB2 UDB are garbage and a waste of money. This book is dogeared and highlighted like crazy from the frantic reads.

Granted the book is not perfect but where else can you learn how Analysis Services 2000 and building an OLAP solution on MS SQL Server? The only other texts that even cover it are the MS SQL Server 2000 Resource Kit (also quite good book too with great tools on CDROM) and the MS SQL Server 2000 Reference Library (another must have for hardcore DBAs like me).

However the use of just fruit is limiting. FOLKS, it all really boils down to eating healthy carbohydrates, good fats and quality proteins on a low calorie diet while getting adequate nutrition. I pretty much as already eating most of the time as this book dictates so it wasnt really a major revelation or anything to me. I read it in the bookstore and thought that it was ok but severely lacking in facts and references to backup what the author was preaching. For a better book on diet, read the Okinawa Program Study and the Zone. More evidence and remember rapid weight loss of more than 2-3 pounds a week is bad news because then you are losing water and muscle and not fat.	2002-04-10

To the dude who said it was not good for the beginner in martial arts, I totally disagree. In fact, as a new student of Choy Li Fut gung fu and not the wing chun that bruce lee  practiced this book has greatly enhanced my training and knowledge. I have the Choy Li Fut kung fu book by Doc Fai Wong and it lacks many details on footwork and punches. Bruce Lee covered the basics which are essential for mastering any style of martial art or fighting for that matter. Yes, it is not 100% complete on wing chun and martial arts like for example it never mentions chau sau (sticky hands) or weapons training but it is great way to learn how to do the correct footwork, stances and core basics. A must for Bruce Lee fans and martial artists. Get this and the Tao of Jeet Kune Do for a wonderful training aid.	2002-03-11

Yes, its impossible to become a gung fu master without a teacher, training and effort. However I expected far more from this book than what it delivers. Its so so on basics and concepts but lacks critical details on how to do footwork, punches and kicks as well as no form or technique instruction on the huge arsenal of choy li fut weapons such as the plum blosson spear and kwan do. For a better gung fu book, check out Bruce Lee's books on JKD as well as the Hung Gar Kung Fu books by Bucksam Kong. The photos in this Choy Li Fut book are difficult at best to follow. I just hope that grandmaster Doc Fai-Wong rewrites and updates this book to make it worthy.	2002-03-11

I am a student and non native speaker of Persian language. For the longest time, I have been wading through grammar books in my attempt to become conversant in Farsi. Most grammar books go on and on about grammar and introduce very little conversation or new vocabulary words at the start. They emphasize how to write the Persian script which is complex to learn and all new words are written in it so these grammar textbooks insist that you can read and write Farsi before speaking it. Well, since I need to be able to communicate with Persians in dialogue this book is much better. Not perfect but quite useful to quickly get basic level of speaking skill in Farsi.	2002-02-21

I have really enjoyed learning yoga with this excellent step by step guide. Although its lighter on theory and explanation of the sutras and philosophy behind yoga than some of the other texts on yoga, its one of the best I've seen on how to do the asanas correctly. When you are thoroughly confused by yoga instructors who are busy teaching 60+ folks in the same classroom, this book will be a far superior mentor and friend than expensive yoga teachers!

Good diagrams and motivation from the king of bodybuilding Arnold. However, more information needed for the natural non-steroid fitness person is sorely needed. Also the workouts are not realistic except for steroid users and the very elite. I do half of what he recommends and thats tough enough to work the muscle.
