If you are looking for deep \\"dishy\\" style of gossip behind the show you will be sadly disappointed.  \\"Sex and the City\\" is a show that will go down (no pun intended) for letting women reveal and talk about love, sex and relationships in a honest true fashion, regardless of how you feel about the characters and their \\"impossible\\" lifestyles.  I always marvel at how this show often broke ground by often crossing gender and cultural guidelines within its audience base. I am intrigued by how universal the show is and how it makes me a little mad that some people want to dismiss it as a silly women/gay show.<br /><br />Split into five parts the book touches on sex and relationships, the social and cultural impact of the show, female identification, narrative text and intertextuality within the show, and of course fashion.  The last essays being a great deal of fun as they look at the famous \\"Sex and the City\\" tour in NYC, fandom and the intersection of being a scholar and bridging fan base gap as well.  Editors Kim Akass  and Janet McCabe should be applaud for their thought-provoking and meaningful work,  I would quickly snatch (again no pun) any critical reader that these ladies do on any series.  A critical celebration of \\"Six feet Under\\" has already been published this spring.  I am \\"dying\\" to read that one. (ok, bad pun intended!)	2005-08-11

Gone is the wonder dark, Gothic overtones that surrounded his last two books. The central character Adam Murphy is an alcoholic reporter, haunted by the death of his mother investigating the apparent suicide of a closeted Marine pilot Daniel Brady, with apparent ties to his now ex-boyfriend Corey who has disappeared and appears to be dead.  Sounds like a soap opera plot turned mystery. Throw in the latest factual reports on the addictive nature of crystal Meth and a child porn ring and you have this novel with very forgettable characters.<br /><br />  While I have read various reports on Meth and the effects on the gay community, it just doesn't work here for me in this novel.  I guess I am too far removed from the LA party scene and I figure I'm not the only one.  To be brutally honest I don't how this got published, Adam Murphy is not a likable character Too many characters and confusing plot lines, and I hope that this doesn't start of series of \\"Adam Murphy mystery\\" books  for this gifted writer.  As with \\"The Snow Garden,\\" pay attention to the opening, it gives the back ground for the character of Caroline Hughes who mother died while trying to save one of her students.	2005-07-06

In this collection of writing Burroughs relives. . his big Tang commercial break, his acknowledgement of his Vanderbilt heritage, his desire to be a transsexual, weirdness and creepiness in dating an undertaker, death and loss of a mouse in bathtub, tyrant housekeepers, body image and \\"roof\\" work , the Catholic Church and gay Catholic Priests , ultra vacation spot Key West, his own brother, Amish country, the habits of an North American opossum and the dangers of steroids, true class at the Kentucky Derby, and shopping (horror!) at K-mart!<br /><br />Everyone tries to compare Burroughs to other humorist author David Sedaris and I think it does both a great injustice, because both are good but in my personal opinion Burroughs' work is edgier to my personal tastes.  I had the opportunity to meet Burroughs at a book singing here in Chicago for this book, he is great guy and very personable.

I start this review by alerting you that I am biased.  I attend Unity in Chicago where Reverend Ed Townley (\\"Rev. Ed\\") is a senior minister.  I also took his class last year on this The Sermon on The Mount using this book.  However you don't need to attend Unity or be familiar with Unity teachings to appreciate this book. Regardless, this is a  book everyone could benefit from and I understand there some talk in the works to release sometime in the near future.  This is not book where you simply read and put back on your book shelf;  it is a book which should in my opinion; re-read and studied, as a daily guide, Meditations are listed with every segmented lesson as Rev. Townley goes through and interprets the words of Jesus.  It is warm and refreshing look at the words of Jesus and in today's fast-paced confused, chaotic world who can't appreciate that?  It appears that the world is slowly awakening to their Spiritual potential and this book is an excellent place to start.  In closing the opening words of Jesus come back to me time and time again \\"Blessed are the Poor in Spirit, for theirs is in the kingdom of heaven.\\"  Spirit does not discriminate this is for everyone if you are willing to read, listen and are open to lovingly translation of the Sermon.	2005-03-30

Near the end of the book Bronski writes:<br /><br />\\"Our culture makes strong distinctions between politics and culture:  how we live our lives vs. what we enjoy.  This has occurred partly because we have allowed sexuality to be compartmentalized and privatized.  We have denied the fact that our most fundamental experience of pleasure is essentially sexual in nature.  The pleasure of a concert, a paining, a play, a movie, all relate in some way to our sexuality.  Things we feel, see hear, and touch enter our consciousness through the physical senses but they become part of our lives and being what they mean to us.  Our experience of the material world in all of its forms and manifestations is profoundly sensual.\\" (p.213)<br /><br />Author Bronski looks at gay culture and the impact that the culture has had not only on the gay community but the world as well.  Bronski traces gay sensibility and the on going quest for \\"beauty\\" that we all psesess.  Bronski traces gay sensibility through the literary works of Walt Whitman, Edward Carpenter and John Addingotn (and of course Oscar Wilde later in the book).  Bronski doesn't stop there as he looks at  Gay sensibility in Hollywood often nodding toward leading and past artists of the [then] time.  Including representations of gay life in Theatre, (\\". . . public acceptance is not going to appear at the second curtain\\" p. 132.  Please remember this was written long, long before Tony Kushner's drama \\"Angels in America\\" in the early nineties.) Going even further Bronski looks at  books aimed at a gay audience;  gay pornography and a very early but dead on target report on gay advertising the then \\"untapped group\\"  by reading last chapter on the pleasure class it is a perfect springboard to his 1998 book called \\"The Pleasure Principle.\\"  If you write or are interested in gay issues/scholarship you are doing yourself a huge disservice by not picking up and reading this and Bronski's other work.ce by not picking up and reading this and Bronski's other work. <br /> <br />	2005-02-16

In desperate need of trying to repair my own troubled mind and heart, it opened my eyes and I realized that this book is really a solid foundation of personal wisdom ad growth.  As I learned over this past Summer a lot of the ideologies and structures we used in daily life are nothing more than falsehoods(dreams) and we can(should) be open to something so much greater than what we currently know.  Having also recently opened myself up to The Course of Miracles I see some very strong parallels here with this book as well.<br /><br />Who can not learn from the knowledge that is being presented here?  The Four Agreements are:<br /><br />1.)Be Impeccable with your Word:<br /><br /> Your words are your sword and also your wand be aware how you use them.<br /><br />Say \\"What you mean and mean what you say\\"<br /><br />2.)Don't take Anything Personally:  One agreement that I am constantly faced with and constantly trying to utilize.<br /><br />3.) on't Make Assumptions:  Another agreement WE could ALL use.  (Think what this world would be like if we didn't make assumptions)<br /><br />4.)

Often missing that the leader is right under his own house in female form. The story is told through her uncle, Rawiri ( which is a slightly different interpretation than what is in the excellent film version of this work).  This is novel for all ages to read and appreciate regardless.  I was pleasantly surprise at the amount of depth here in the novel and the wonderfully imaginative way the story unfolds.  I can't remember when I last heard whales talk to each other, or when I laughed so hard at the all too familiar antics and love between grandmother, Nanny Flowers and grandfather, Koro Apirana which left me pleasantly nodding my head.

Book  discussion about the novel among friends didn't focus on the story of a modern day quest for the Holy Grail (with clues of course in Leonardo Da Vinci's art work). The discussion focused on the concepts and theories that were raised in the novel. For me, the main characters and places serve as backdrop for the ideas being raised by the novel.<br />In the novel the reader is taken on a electrifying roller coaster ride.  From Leonardo Da Vinci's painted clues, pagan rituals, a true secret society (Opus Dei), modern day Knights, the relationship between Mary Magdalene and Jesus, the oppression and  fear of the Divine Feminine and even a eye-opening insight into Disney's images, this book will raise more than few eyebrows and makes the reader think.<br />I can only image the amount of research Mr. Brown had to do with this novel.  The author has done a breathtaking job of putting all the pieces of the puzzle together for you that will leave you in suspense, on the edge of your chair and in some cases up all night until the last page is turned.

Schifter utilizes both quantitative and qualitative research methods into uncovering this phenomenon in Costa Rica.  A qualitative scholar myself, it was these participant's accounts that I read directly (some funny, some very sad).  Schifter makes a good argument stating that these participants experiences of childhood sexual abuse are what dictates these participants current sexuality as adults. (Can't say I agree 100% with this, but it is a convincing argument nonetheless.  Also, while I recognize that this an all too important work I question if this work really reflects the attitudes of all of Latin Society).<br />Schifter uncovers locations for public sexual activity in Costa Rica. The difference between Cacheros and Locusts. (Cacheros are male prostitutes that are not considered homosexual as long as they aren't penetrated; Locusts utilize their sexual allure to attract paying male customers and often rob or murder them).  Rounding out the chapter Schifter shows the attitudes of police officers toward gay Latino men, which is a direct reflection of the country's own homophobia and hatred.	2004-01-22

In short, all because gays experience sexual freedom and often live their sexuality freely without fear of repercussions which straight society feels would be the downfall of civilization as know it, especially if everyone adopted this paradigm of thought.  This is a myth that gets explicated fully here by Bronski drawing on several examples from history and research.  Bronski makes his most insightful points on the \\"gaze\\" of the male body, the continued struggles for gays due to the AIDS crisis and the difference between public and private space relating to the \\"gay ghetto\\" in straight society.  Also Bronski makes a startling revelation that gay society is not assimilating to the straight ideal but that straight society is actually accepting, adopting and drawing from gay culture more. The thought that \\"the world is turning upside down\\" due to the experience of sexual pleasure is ridiculous and unfounded.  As a scholar interested in media and gay studies I can't stress how important and meaningful I found this text to be.  It justifiably has a place in every personal and academic library because within it this book speaks volumes of information.	2003-10-15

A word to describe this book?  \\"Remarkable.\\"  One  of the few books that after I started it, I looked forward to reading everyday because in my opinion, it says so much. While I have read several books on gay studies for my graduate work this is one that truly makes a difference.  Author Douglas Sadownick has wrote a book that gets to the heart of gay studies because it tells the history of gay male culture from a sexual perspective.  Too many books in the gay studies arena avoid it or talk around it.  Sadownick begins by tracing the beginnings of gay culture back after World War II in the late 40's/early 50's, the liberating 60's, the \\"feel good, party days\\" of the 70's, the sobering 80's due to the AIDS crisis, to the mid 90's the signifies a return to sex and the introduction of crystal meth to give gay men a new thrill, while a portion of the gay community dares to ask and show that \\"there is something more\\"<br /> I also applaud Mr. Sadownick for identifying some spiritual perspectives, many of them rooted in new age and new thought, that are again, often ignored in other works.<br />In conclusion, I have no idea what this book's original publication did in terms of sales or public interest having discovered this book 7 years after its initial run.  However, this is a book that I would gladly pay full price for if Mr. Sadownick would revise a second edition. (hopefully by 2006, 10 years after the initial publication).  This way he could write on the recent 2003 Supreme Court ruling on Sodomy that has had several ripple effects and shockwaves on many people regardless of their political beliefs.  I will definitely look for more future works by this author.	2003-07-19

Both books are valuable and reliable resources but I think to compare both books against each other is a little unjust to both authors.  Tropiano brings to light shows and episodes that Capsuto missed or forgot to mention for one reason or another and really picks up where Capsuto's earlier work leaves off.<br />That being said I did have a few problems with this book.<br />First, Tropiano categorizes representation by genre of show. For example, early homosexual image, law and cop shows, dramas, and sitcoms.  While this is a unique style that works well, it sometimes hard for the reader to grasp the social significance of a show done in the 1950's when in the next paragraph he is talking about a more recent episode and show.  A chronological style would have enabled the reader to see the social connotations and historical references better, I think.<br /> Author Tropiano does a good job of describing the episodes in detail (a little too good at times) giving the reader a full detailed summary of the individual episodes' plot with dialogue.  Where I got frustrated as a reader was the fact that Tropianos goes on and on describing episode after episode; without ever giving his critical insight on why he thinks the episode(s) are significant.  (Being a gay studies and popular culture critic myself this is also a familiar and dangerous trap that I have fallen into myself.)<br />It is nit-picky but I noticed some very oblivious typos and mis-wording and I'm usually the last person to notice such references.<br />Still all and all, this is highly valuable text for television and gay studies readers and scholars alike.  There is no denying the depth of the research that was done here and for that I gladly applaud and say \\"Bravo!\\"	2003-06-21

A must for scholars interested in gender conditioning and/or gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered studies.<br />Then again, everyone can benefit from this book (and I don't often say that about books.)  Minor shows that homophobia hurts everyone regardless of their sexual orientation.  In fact, as Mr. Minor points out, the actual issue of sexual orientation has very little to do with the oppression than the issue that someone is perceived \\"different.\\"  Which also means that gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and transgendered people must stop playing the \\"victim role\\" when dealing with the oppression.  His last chapter on being human is one that I will have to go back and re-read time and time again, because it is a revolutionary light and insight into an age-old way of thinking.	2003-06-13

I have often heard in certain circles that she is  dubbed a \\"mystical, spiritual activist.\\" What I like about this book is that she avoids flowery, idealistic, perceptions and Ms. Williamson gives the reader insight into from the everyday mundane to hectic times, occurrences and realistic situations in which the Glory of God can be found.  Anyone can pick up the book and get something out of it, the beauty in this work it that anyone regardless of their spiritual or religious level can relate to it.  One of the few works that I will refer to time and time again for inspiration and guidance.  Having read this work I can clearly see that there are certain universal laws that we (as a human race) must be attuned too if we are to evolve as human beings.  True Heaven on Earth is here and believe it or not, the journey starts from within.	2003-06-13

I have read this book for two book groups here in Chicago and the ending still generates a lot of debate. Author Jim Grimsley's \\"Dream Boy\\" is a modern classic novel about two teen-age boys, \\"Nathan\\" and \\"Roy,\\" who find each other as other forces strive to rip them apart. Nathan holds a dark secret and looks to Roy for salvation, while Roy is slowly coming to terms of who he is. Also present is the bullish \\"Burke\\" who watches Nathan and Roy with an all-to-aware suspicious eye. Grimsley's writing style is so lyrical that at times you question if this is \\"reality\\" or a \\"ghostly dream.\\" Grimsley brings themes of love, sex, religion and violence together with an explosive force. ( Having read some of Grimsley's other work \\"violence\\" is a frequent theme i.e. the ending and decision made by the central character Newell in Grimsley's \\"Boulevard.\\") Grimsley writing also gives the reader vivid, delicious description and detail of the North Carolina setting in this novel. \\"Dream Boy\\" is not to be missed! While so many gay themed novel fail to rise to the occasion, \\"Dream Boy\\" rises to new heights.	2003-05-19

I kept thinking as I read this novel that Mr. Grimsley was writing a screenplay or a script for the theatrical stage. What I do like in this work was the liberation of the central character Newell, who comes to New Orleans seeking a life he can only dream about, hence escaping the small town life of Pastel, Alabama. In some respects Newell's life mirrors my own experience when I moved to Chicago. Newell's sexual odyssey is what drives the novel, and the other notable characters as Ms. Sophia (A mentally deranged transvestite who works in the adult bookstore with Newell) Mac (the greasy, loud, bossy manager of the adult bookstore) and Mark (Newell's on-then-off again druggey boyfriend) fill in as bit players developed well enough to the point of passing interest for the reader. The ending of the novel seems a bit rushed and not well thought out as Newell decided to return to small town life, defeated by all the sexual imagery and freedom that surrounded him on a daily basis. There is no build for Newell's decision and hence, no empathy for me as a reader. I can only hope that Mr. Gimsley next literary effort will be as rich as the one I experienced with \\"Dream Boy\\" and \\"Comfort and Joy.\\"	2003-04-29

That said it is impossible to write on the all the emotional levels that \\"Raisin\\" brings to the reader and/or audience member.<br />A struggling, African-American family strives to make it out of crowded Chicago Housing Project and to own their piece of American dream pie.  Several of the characters in this extremely well written drama have their own dilemma to face:  Ruth Younger, wife to Walter, must decide if she should have bring another baby to her already financially strapped family. Walter Younger, husband to Ruth, who has huge dreams and little means, of providing for his family.  Beneatha Younger, sister to Walter, who is med student and dreams of being a doctor now questions her own life and culture.  Finally, and most importantly, is Lena Younger (Mama) who is fighting to keep her family together after the death of her husband.  The issue of assimilation of African heritage in American culture is still significant factor today and continues to be a struggle for many minorities in America as well.  In my opinion, Raisin remains a fresh and relevant dramatic work for today and for many years to come.	2003-04-29

Harris looks critically at several different areas of gay culture: gay males and \\"diva\\" worship, gay romance in the personal ads, how gay men helped the underwear revolution, the AIDS \\"crisis\\", leathermen, gay pornography in both film and literature, gay magazines, drag and gay propaganda. Whiles Harris's book is now six years old, it is for me, relevant and fresh as he argues about the dangers in assimilation into heterosexual, mainstream culture. I wished he would have pointed out more clearly how gay men can stop and fight against assimilation through building our culture which I think for any scholar is a very blurry answer. Be prepared, this book generated quite a bit of debate in a book group that I belong to in Chicago and I feel that it gets similar reactions in any part of gay community when it is read. For me, though I wished more gay men would read such a fine work as this. If anything can be said for this work, it does generate thought and critical discussion which I think more and more people do not want to engage in, because it is so much easier not to. Plus society doesn't reinforce this; so much as it does the idea of the \\"status quo.\\"	2003-04-09

You do not need to be a regular Sunday church-goer, or a member of Unity or even a theologian to understand the many messages in this book.<br />It may sound quirky, but all need is faith and remember that you are never alone in this world no mater what crisis(s) you may face.

Mr. Sullivan present different viewpoints on the subject of homosexuality (Prohibitionist, Liberationist, Conservative and Liberal)  To present any argument you must understand the position of your opponent and I welcome the chance here ( in this book) to do that.<br />Not everyone in the gay studies filed has embraced the book and some have spoken very publicly against it, which is funny to me since everyone wants freedom of speech and equal rights, but how quickly we are to condemn those whose viewpoints do not reflect our own.  In closing Mr. Sullivan makes some valid arguments for the legalization of same-sex marriage, which he claims would not undermine heterosexual marriage, but may actually strengthen it.  Finally someone who commands that we think about ouselves and our culture, who does not give the reader a sugary sweet view of what the world could, should be like.	2003-03-20

Author Annamarie Jagose does a good job of highlighting the top scholars in the queer studies field and putting them together in one, concise volume.  As a media communications scholar with an emphasis in queer studies I found this book immensly helpful.  Jagose does a good job of chronicling history as well, so that the reader gets an insight of what was going on historically in the gay rights movement.  I applauded the chapter also on lesbian feminism since that is often left out of many queer studies books.  Highly recommended for scholar new to this field.  While the definition(s) of \\"queer\\" are hard to define, I can at least appreciate someone who can make some sense of an often confusing and muddy subject.	2003-03-03

Sylvia shows the blessings and comfort for the reader in many areas of life: Finding comfort in grief, discovering life's purpose, building relationships, listening to children, finding joy, the meaning of guilt, the importence of family and friends and getting throught the holidays( which I found extremely helpful this year since I am currently unemployed).  This book is more than just Sylvia reiterating her knowledge, it also mediation exercises and affirmations that can help in a variety of situations.

While Einar/Lilli is a geat character, I was amazed at the character of Greta (Einar's wife and Lilli's friend) who accepts her husband's life, which slowly and painfully comes to  a point where a decison must be made between the two for the both of them.

This book works on several levels first, the theme of friendship and second of love, which sometimes means scarifying everything beyond reason for the sake of another.  Third greed, the things we do get ahead in the world.  For example, Molina deceiving Valentin, which in the end he does get his freedom (although I strongly questions if he indeed wants it by this point, having fallen in love with Valentin) which eventually costs Molina his life. Fourth, the love of gay men for movies as Molina tells Valentine countless stories of movies he has seen.<br />There are some drawbacks to this novel, first a series of footnotes that explains various theories on homosexuality, that in no way strengthen the story or further explain the character of Molina. In parts of the novel it becomes very confusing in terms of who is speaking to who.<br />Both the film and the musical are strong adaptations from this work and have introduced many fresh audiences to this new but ageless story.	2003-02-08

Every movie that he writes about in his book is in some way or another a winner, regardless of what it did in box office receipts. Still this book is a lot more than just a much of plot synopsis and message of some really great movies. Mr. Simon writes about his life growing up in movie industry. His battle to get both \\"Somewhere in Time\\" and \\"What Dreams May Become\\" (both based on books by author Richard Matheson-a great writer himself) made into films. His elation of getting both films made and then watching as the critics ripped both of them both apart , only to become resurrected and warmly welcomed on cable, video and DVD by thousands of people years later.

I have never thought of myself as a spirtual person, but this book has indeed changed all of that. A lot of the things that Sylvia talks about are things that have I thought about but never fully realized.  (For example, Our own spirit guides, life on the other side, the endless circle of life, and fianlly  and most importantly, God's true love which is void of any guilt.)  I look forwarded to reading more books by Sylvia and educating myself spiritually.  In a world which is growning with more ane more uncertainity, it is wonderful to have someone make sense of it all.  Read this for yourself, especially those who have experience any type of recent loss, may you feel the spirit of love flow through you.	2002-10-20

Willa Cather's novel was a recent selection for the One Book, One Chicago program and what a rich treat it was, since I was familar with any work from this author. While I'm not big on \\"pioneer\\" or \\"western\\" type novels, this book was sheer joy. There are many themes in the book and to go through each one would be to write a review that goes on for pages and pages. So I'll try and hit the major themes that came out to me. First the theme of the immigrant expereince are here, the hardships of trying to build a new life in a stange life where opportunity is promised. Second, you get the real feel of the Nebraskan land and the effect of the land on the people and vise versa. Third, the reader becomes aware of the \\"circle of life\\" and the people in our lives; how our existence effects and is affected by so many people. Fourth and finally, it is a subtle love story between Antonia and the narrator, Jim Burden, which is the device the Cather uses to tell this incredbile story. Jim leaves small town life an becomes a educated sucessful man, while Antonia stays behind and gains her education from the her own life, one that can not be validated by any piece of paper. A true masterpiece is written here with every sentence.	2002-10-20

While Phillip is confronting his changing relationship with his lover, Elliot, his father Owen is finally, confronting his homosexuality.  Highly recommended.  Each character is richly developed and textured, they feel like real people that you know. While the film is good, it uses London as a backdrop rather than the book's all-to-real-modern-urban life set in New York and in the transistion looses something.	2002-10-11

I really didn't think that this book was all that insightful or entertaining about a group of prostitutes (\\"lizards\\") and their adventures, set in West Virgina. I have a theory that the title character; \\"Sarah/Sam\\" is a thinly veiled reference to Jesus Christ, but even that doesn't even hold up by the end of the book. (There is a reference in the book that \\"Sarah\\" is a saint because (s)he can walk on water). I really don't know what the book club I belong to was thinking when they picked this book.

I must admit that I am a fan. However, this book is nothing more than a 260 page coming-out-novel. It reads like a screenplay for a Lifetime movie. (I must admit though that Ms. Brown can write a very hot [intimate] scene, better than any gay male writer I've ever read).  I thought the Wallace characters were a weak, comic reflief device that I could have done without.  Also this story doesn't seem to read true with its lesbian content given that time period that the story takes place.  In the book, the story takes place in the 1980's but reads with a late 1990's gay acceptability that I found hard to believe, again given the time period and the setting (Virginia).  As for the story, there is a \\"surprise twist\\" with Chris, that is interesting but a little too late for me. The Epilogue ties things up \\"too neatly\\" and is also unbelievable.  I was really surprised that Vic ins't dating a guy again by the end of the book.  I really didn't like Vic as a character.  I never got a true sense from Vic when she starts to identify herself as lesbian.  It is a little too \\"overnight,\\"  there is no build to the fact that she like women...	2002-09-24

If you are A-list pretty boy, you may not get his humor.  For the rest of us, the truth is not out there but right (write) here before our eyes.  I took this book with me recently to Florida and as I was sitting in a gay club with everybody swirling around me, everyone (that is) in his ( and her) own little world, I just threw my head back and laughed thinking of Ford's pearls of funny wisdom.  There was a time when sitting in club alone would would have left me depressed.  After reading a couple of Ford's books, not anymore!  Thank You, Mr. Ford, for at last getting me to \\"wake up\\"  and not take gay life so seriously.

I must admit at first, I was not excited about reading this Civil War era novel, but once I started it I was taken over and captivated until the last page.  Some books you forget soon after you finished them, but this novel still stays with me. The story revolves around a man named Dr. August, his fellow slave (and one time lover)Issac Kemp who loses his heart to a white governess, Alice Pangbourn.  It appears at times that Dr. August is a brillant con man using his audiences to pray on their weaknesses.  In parts of the book, there are the presence of \\"Spirits\\" that take over the piano playing of Dr. August. (Which I like since you are never truly sure of fact and fiction.)  This book works on so many levels: racism, class, sexuality and the true spirit of human love, that to go one about each one would lead to a review that goes on for pages and pages.  I would love to see this book as a television minseries and I think it would sell. Read this book, you will not be disappointed and you will soon see the talent of an amazing, wonderful storyteller and writer.	2002-07-07

It is amazing to me that people don't always pick up on the symbolism and concentrate soley on the story. (I keep thinking about the birthday cake scene in this book comapred to a similar scene in The Hours).  I have read this book for two book groups here in Chicago and each time it was greeted with rave reviews.  This book moves  and in parts resemble very much our own families; our own \\"Flesh and Blood.\\"  As always Cunningham draws a line to the readers's heart and touches the soul.	2002-07-06

Author Peter Lefcourt has created a good, funny and enjoyable novel.  Professional Baseballall Payer Randy Dreyfus falls in love with his second baseman, D.J. When the two are caught shaing a kiss on security videotape at Neimun Marcus, all hell breaks loose and damage control is called in.  The rest of the novel is not only and engaging story but also a hidden humorous social commentaty on gay men in professional sports.  The fact that the white, male hero has fallen in love with his black second baseman will more than raise a few eyebrows for some readers. Lefcourt captures the homophobia and hysteria generated by this perfectly.  My only drawback to the book is that the sections dealing with Randy's wife, Susie seem underdeveloped and she seems to fade away and out by the end of the book... Recently, I have heard people say that gay men in Sports are no big deal.  After reading this book I'm not so sure.  True, this is a work of fiction, but Lefcourt a created an honest and truthful home run.	2002-07-05

Author Suzanna Danuta Walters chronciles the history of gay visibility in America excellently in this book!  Looking at it from a variety of perspectives:  Cinema, Television, Advertising (Marketing)and her own personal accounts of being a lesbian parent.  While the debate rages on over assimilation, equal rights and the unigueness of gay culture,  I feel that the author has done an excellent job bringing to light valid arguements while chronciling the history of how far we have come as a culture and how much furhter we have to go.  It never ends and we are fooling arourselves to think that it does.<br />It sometime shocks and angers me how the gay community refuses to support such good work as this.  Ignorance in anytything is not bliss!<br />Anyone interested in any type of gay studies should read this book. The author puts together tons of research into a rich and well developed text.	2002-07-04

The whole idea of going back to \\"samll town\\" life strikes a chord in several gay men and I think it is the part I enjoy the most about this book.  Although some critics argue that this is a \\"quick, fluff beach read\\" I rate this novel a notach above the likes of \\"California Screaming\\" and \\"Misadventures in 213\\"  Those characters seem stupid and mindless, while the Clu Latimore ( althought a pretty boy character) has to face a \\"dilemia\\" that has been growing for sometime.

For me the Paris that Baldwin writes about is not that far away from contemporary gay society.  It is amazing how much has changed for the community while men (although not all) have remain mostly the same.  There are certain parts of this book that will always remain with me, the shift in the narrative from present day to past memory, cental character, David's experimentation and later rejection of his friend Joey, David's first meeting with Giovanni, and the white, paint smeared window in Giovanni's room that  separated two men in love from world that was not yet beginning to understand.

The best part of this book are the journal entries written by the characters themselves because they actaully allow you to get into the character's head and into the emotional context of each character. We get some more insight into the character of John Basil Henderson but it is not enought to make me care. Ever time I read a E.

Not since I've read the works of Michael Cunningham has an author captured or moved me so. I identifed very strongly with the central character, Robin MacKenzie, having grown-up closely to the same time period.  So many authors throw pop culture references into their books so that the reader can identify themselves with the book.  By doing this, they think it will make up for the poor writing, which is definately not the case here!  Author K.M. Soehnlein draws you into Robin's world effortlessly and everything is described in perfect, colorful, vivid detail that stays with you long after the book is closed. (Examples, describing the fatal trajedy with his brother, Jackson.  Or, Robin's love and sexual awakening with both Scott Schatz and Todd Spicer. Why is it that us  \\"normal boys\\" are always attracted to the dangerous, \\"rough boys?\\")  One of the few novels that I hope the author writes a sequel to. Please don't tell that the world of Robin MacKenzie is over when his his life is just beginning.  Would make an great movie or play!  Someone please \\"green light\\" this!!	2002-02-04

Although I must admit it got a little hokey at times. &quot;Using the the force, Anakin. . . &quot;With all the mystery the Force presents it gets a little too unbelievable in parts.  The ending plot sems far-fetched and sketchy even for an experienced Jedi, but as &quot;Star Wars&quot; has proven time and time again, whole empires can fall on far less.  I believe George Lucas has to approve the stories that writers submit so it will be interesting to see if any of these details from this story are carried forward into the new movie.

I had a hard time finsihing this work. This book is not a mystery. What is really amazing it that a local theater company here in Chicago is adapting this for the stage. When I saw a workshop of this work, I was intrigued and desperately wanted to read it, so I suggested for a Book Club I belong to. It starts off with a real bang and I enjoyed the relationship of Chris and Taylor. Taylor becomes Chris' obesession and a cataylst for her growth as she moves into another relationship with her ex Renny(after Taylor's mysterious disaperance)and the journey as she moves past both relationships. I really feel for the battle scarred Chris all to well.<br />So what bugged me about the book for its low rating?-Wordy, lacks dialogue to keep the reader moving and interested. At times I felt I was in swamp trying to move to the next page. I find myself going back and reading whole pages over and over again because I couldn't focus on it.

Yes, but not for a long, long time.<br />Still the big question is-\\"Do we ever really know the person we fall in love with?\\" The answer like this book, is as clear as the mud in the bottom of deep dark river.	2002-01-01

This sequel tries to be as much trashy fun as the original and leaves the reader unimpressed. Nothing is shocking in this book.  No twists come completely out of nowhere.  Still to compare this book with the orginal is doing this book a great injustice. Still the \\"shadow\\" of Jacqueline Susann lingers and it is very hard not to compare the two works.<br />Neely is still my favorite ... character and I love all the chapters with her.  The contemporary setting didn't brother me, but why didn't the author leave the book in the orginal time period and work through the sexual haze of the 70's and the sobering early 80's?  Did she feel it wouldn't sell?  I felt sorry for the character of Anne Wells and her quest for love and in the end the book left me wondering if we can ever find a faithful true love?  Do we ever have a second chance at true love?  Near the end, I though \\"Yes\\" but by the end I'm questioning that answer. ...	2002-01-01

Although the book &quot;jumps&quot; around (I got confused) a little it is still a superb work. Mr. Grimsley had effortlessly caught the emotion that many gay men feel when they go home to their parent(s) for the hoildays.  (with partners of not)  The barrier of differnce still exists.  I like the many opposites this book had, the richness of Ford's family compared to poor, humble family of Dan.  (Is it any wonder that Dan's family is more accepting?)  The family scenes fly by and I would really like to see a movie made out of this book, I think it would sell!  I wish all the new modern Christmas stories were as good as this!  Highly recommended!!	2001-12-03

While this book has gotten some strong regonition and kudos in the community it did nothing for me.  The book is more character than plot driven, and the characters are not that interesting!  I really thought this book would focus more on Isabel and her relationship whith her mother as she relects back on her time spent with her as she grows up.  And how that relationship shapes her adult life as a lesbian.  Her mother's death should be a catlyst but is a rather flat, useless side note.  I kept expecting this book to take off like a rocket but it keeps plodding along like a farm tractor on a empty field.  In the end, this book left me more frustrated and angry over the time I wasted on it.	2001-12-01

I don't understand why the gay community goes ga-ga over books like this!  While this might be cute and enjoyable for some, this book is not for  the more mature reader who enjoys the rich field of gay literature.  Focusing on frequent drug use,  a intervention of a jealous boyfriend who foces Harry and Nic to have sexual activity at gunpoint(?) Harry must lie to get his hands on the family fortune, what wonderful valuses to relay the future generation of readers. Utterly forgettable by the last page!	2001-12-01

Needless to say, I was very impressed with the artist and the way Ms. Hardin captures her in this book.  The book has inspired me to do more research on Frida by capturing some of Frida's greatest work here.  I recommend this book to anyone who desires to begin study on the work and life of Frida Kahlo.	2001-11-25

I haven't had this much fun since &quot;STAR WARS.&quot;<br />(If the movie can catch even a fourth of the magic it should be a big hit!)  This book has a lot of wisdom and entertainment for both kids and adults and bridges a gap for the generations, like a good Disney movie only better!  I like a a lot of the insights and philosophies that the book gives through the use of a great story and characters, one of the biggest being (for me) that 1.)things are not always as they appear to be and 2.) pure evil and take on many forms.  I can't read the rest in the series it sounds like they are also fun and well thought out.  Harry Potter is ther hero for the kid in all of us!	2001-11-19

A good book for boosting any company or ororganization's morale, however the whole &quot;golly gee&quot; aspect gets really old after a while; The grand utopia idea that everyone buys into the concept is a bit much. (and it is better here than in some of the other management books I've read) How do you get the nay-sayers on board?-Is what I realy want to see from any management book. &quot;Chosing your attitude&quot; one of the main ingridents for high morale is one that is too often looked over by everyone whether in or outside any organization. If people really stoped and looked at theit attitude, things in this world would be very different. Playing at work? This goes againist a century old minset that I think is very hard for companies to change. Still all and all, this book offers some good ideas that are extremely timely in today's very tight job market.	2001-11-05

This was my first Matheson novel and I was greatly impressed with his story telling and writing style.  Stephen King is quoted on the back of the paperback copy of Matheson's book; stating Matheson was a great influence on him as a writer.  It shows-Matheson's descripton of characters put me instantly in mind of Stephen King when he describes characters, escpecially those identified as husband and wife.  Although some may find the horror elements of this novel tame, it is none the less a creepy story in the realm of the dead and the living.  The film can't compare and it is a true shame that more elemens of Matheson's book (the &quot;twist&quot; ending, the seductive neighbor, Anne's struggle as a wife to understand Tom's condition) weren't used.  Definately an author whose work I want to read more of.	2001-11-03

The abstract &quot;My Name, Multitudinos Mass&quot; by Larry la Fountain-Stokes is the weakest in the bunch.  I recommended this anthology to my G&amp;L book group who was very impressed with the the writing.  Highly recommended, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I do think several so called &quot;gay writers&quot; could take lessons in effective story telling from the authors in this collection.	2001-11-03

Althought &quot;The Night Listener&quot; is not Armmistead Maupin's best work, it is still an enetertaining novel.  Maybe I am biased because I am so happy to see and read a new Maupin novel. (The nod to &quot;Tales of the City&quot; in this book was a nice welcomed touch) The entire time I read this novel I couldn't see or think of anyone else but Armistead as Gabriel Noone.  My problems with the novel are legit-the novel gives a few twists but not enough turns as a successful mystery.  I recommend to all readers to read the beginning of the novel again when you finsih to get a true sense of the circular motion of the book.  All and all Armistead never fails to grab the reader with with his words that can capture a feeling, a mood or atmposphere-brillantly!	2001-11-02

While I can remember lines and stories from &quot;Sex in the City&quot; (the book) I couldn't describe a single element of this book if I tried, after I read it. In a word-totally forgettable.

I learned more about Cuba after reading the late Mr. Aremas book then I ever did in school! The discusssion and debate this book has generated in local book clubs I've attended has been fierce! (See: The four Categories of Gays) Mr. Arenas had interjected the harshness of Cuban life with humor so strong I was laughing everytime I read this book. (His personal &quot;sexcapades&quot; are worthy of the cost-Although I don't believe all of them!) Do yourself a favor read this book!(and then see the movie if you haven't already.)	2001-10-31

The story is simple and clear and the lessons from this book can apply to anyone, anywhere, at anytime in their life.  I was reading this book as I was making a job change and also ending a personal relationship.  The lessons from this book saved a lot on frustrations on both counts.  It is amazing to me the people I see in my life who refuse to change for whatever reason and then complain that everyone else is ruining their lives. For critics who dislike the book I really wonder if they are living by its everyday principles.  This is one of the few book where there is something in it for everyone!	2001-10-31

It would be too easy to bash this book; Christopher Rice's first effort is a melodramatic mess of a novel.

I must admit I am not a follower of Gothic novels which I think Mr. Rice is trying to duplicate here.  (Leave the scary stuff to your Mom, Chris)<br />Question: Is everyone in New Oreleans gay and/or a drunk?  Hopefully Mr. Rice's sophomore effort will be more promising.	2001-10-20
