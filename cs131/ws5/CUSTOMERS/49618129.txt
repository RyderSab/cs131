Janice Romney Farnsworth lived with one for fifteen years and bore six children for him. A devout Mormon, Farnsworth believed in the sanctity of marriage, of being a submissive wife and honoring her husband. But what she didn't understand was why her husband repeatedly beat her, demeaned her, turned her children against her, convinced others she was mentally ill and a danger to her children, and raped her.<br /><br />Faced with this ongoing horror, Farnsworth turned to her Church for help. She was advised to go back and be a better wife, while her batterer enjoyed the full benefits of church membership.<br /><br />Poignant and eye opening, Beneath Wings of an Angel, is a fascinating look inside the mind of a woman who became a victim of domestic violence. Her nightmare, told in her own voice, complete with her own thoughts of no self-worth so she must deserve it, and the downward spiral of her life, physically and mentally is torment to watch. But it also inspires understanding and a longing to reach out.<br /><br />Farnsworth has brought forth a look inside the terror of prolonged domestic violence that helps the outside world understand why a woman would stay and submit to the lies and blows of an abuser. She also tells, without excuse, the damage an abusive home heaps upon the children of that home.<br /><br />Anger, disbelief, understanding, empathy, and rejoicing - all are emotions Farnsworth's story brings about in the reader as the reader experiences the writer's life.<br /><br />Farnsworth found her path to healing, but only after experiencing the worst that can be dealt.<br /><br />\\"During those awful days, I felt like yesterday's trash, and for the most part, really didn't care. I don't know how others coped, but I faced each day with a tear-stained face too tired to take care of myself, emotionally drained and obsessed with revenge.\\"<br /><br />When Farnsworth was finally able to escape her abusive husband, she then faced trouble with the courts and the danger of having her children taken from her. Her children suffered dreadfully at the hands of their father - not only physically, but emotionally. Today, Farnsworth is still praying for her children's healing.<br /><br />Beneath Wings of an Angel is unique in several ways - it gives a glimpse inside the Mormon religion and tradition; it chronicles fifteen years of abuse, and more importantly, why she stayed; it also offers hope as Farnsworth details her therapy, a new love that is not abusive, a deeper spiritual awakening and her acknowledgment of the necessity of the continuance of the journey.<br /><br />Abuse knows no class, race or religion - this book is a stepping stone to freedom from abuse, for counselors and pastors to understand the dynamics of abuse and the need for the Church to be proactive and provide safety for women under attack.faced trouble with the courts and the danger of having her children taken from her.

Good looks. Her own business. Even a Mrs. Arizona title. But Dianne Schwartz hid a gruesome secret. She was a victim of continued physical abuse by her first husband. How does a seemingly successful, beautiful woman fall into the snare of an abuser? Schwartz tells us, beginning with childhood issues that evolved into setting her up as a victim for domestic violence.<br /><br />In the preface to Whose Face is in the Mirror, the author introduces us to an essential part of healing from abuse-ridding oneself of shame. Through her story, Schwartz seeks to share her abuse, insight into how and why she came to be abused, her steps to recovery and her ongoing journey and encouragement to other survivors of abuse.<br /><br />Painful at times, this true story rings more than true - it resonates within the soul. We all have known a woman just like Dianne Schwartz - a woman who we shake our heads at and wonder, \\"Is she nuts? Why does she listen to that loser? Why does she go back? How can she trust him again?\\" No, Dianne isn't nuts, and neither is any other woman caught in the deadly game of domestic abuse. For the abuser, it's just that: a game of control. For the victim, however, it's a test of survival.<br /><br />Whose Face is one short portrait into the lives of the abused and the abuser. It shows the damage done to children. It brings out childhood issues that might contribute to one's being abused. It provides answers and courage to take the steps to safety, to life.<br /><br />Schwartz's no-nonsense approach is a wakeup call to women who are being abused. She challenges the many abuse victims in today's world to look in the mirror and recognize the part they play in being abused. For without a victim, the abuser cannot abuse. She exposes the lies that litter an abusive relationship, such as:<br /><br />* He will change.<br />* We cause him to be angry and abusive.<br />* We want people to like our spouse (so we cover for him).<br />* I'm nothing without him.<br />* I can't make it on my own.<br />* I deserve to be beaten. I'm useless.<br />* All men are terrible.<br />* No other man will be attracted to me.<br />* I stay because I love him.<br />* My children need their father.<br /><br />Schwartz doesn't stop there. For every lie, she exposes the truth and gives real-world answers to getting out and staying safe.<br /><br />In Part Three of Whose Face, Schwartz details the healing process, including recognizing the signs of an abuser. More importantly, she educates women, through her own process of healing, of how to recognize if they are attracted to an abuser. Some of the personality traits an abuser attracter might have are:<br /><br />* The need to rescue.<br />* Accepting abuse during the dating stage.<br />* A dysfunctional family history of verbal or physical abuse.<br /><br />Schwartz goes several steps further and looks into the effects our abuse may be having on our children. Are we setting our children up to be either abused or to be an abuser?<br /><br />Healing from abuse is not something to be done alone. Schwartz's life example illustrates the importance of therapy and recognizing a Higher Power - in Schwartz's case, that power is God. Through therapy and God, she discovered her passion in life and finally recognized whose face was in the mirror. After 42 years of living with self-hatred, this woman chose to heal, and to share her journey to self-love.<br /><br />Today, Schwartz is the founder and president of Educating Against Domestic Violence, a nonprofit organization providing assistance to battered persons. She is happily and healthily married and continues to heal, as are her children.o be beaten.

When Sue's therapist suggested she write down her experience, Sue expected only a paragraph to emerge. Instead, Because I Remember Terror emerged from an almost unstoppable flow of words. Today, Silverman is an award-winning writer, speaker and teacher.<br /><br />When I read the first chapter of Because I Remember Terror, Father, I Remember You, I knew I held in my hands an important book - a book that could change lives. I immediately wished for a box of these books to take around and hand out to people: mothers in denial; young women being molested; grown women who had been abused; men who were abusers; counselors and pastors; anyone who would read the book and \\"get it!\\"<br /><br />Silverman \\"got it\\" and does so with a powerful, lyrical voice that is haunting, full of truth and cuts to the truth. What Silverman went through as a child, no child should have to go through. Sadly, many children suffer from sexual abuse. It is unreported, not talked about, ignored, denied-name it-if it can be covered up, it will be. But Silverman's experience, and her outstanding courage to reveal it to the world brings an understanding quite unlike other books about child sexual abuse. It's personal. It's written by a master writer. It's honest-painfully so. It shines a powerful beacon onto the darkest secret the world doesn't want to see. It is triumphant.<br /><br />Understanding the dynamics of a sexually abused child, the abuser, the household in which the abuse takes place, is paramount to stopping the abuse. Silverman gives readers an unprecedented look into the mind of the abused, the tactics of the abuser, the activities of an enabler, and the damage that is done to a child who should be celebrating their innocence.<br /><br />Get it. Read it. Pass it on.	2005-09-27

Stuart is a Licensed Clinical Pastoral Counselor, Conflict Management Consultant, and a Minister of the Gospel. She lives in Georgia with her son, Stephen. Betrayal of Sacred Trust was inspired after Stuart engaged in a doctoral study on women living with their unfaithful husbands. She states, \\"This is a contribution to the participants, whose voices need to be heard.\\"<br /><br />Counselors, pastors, friends, families, husbands and wives - anyone who comes into contact with marital infidelity issues will find answers and insights inside the pages of Betrayal. Without dramatization, but instead a studied approach to understanding the why's and how's behind adultery, Dr. Stuart explores this subject in depth.<br /><br />Divided into four sections, The Structure of Marriage, Marital Unfaithfulness, Consequences of Infidelity and Interpersonal Conflict, the author delves into the issues surrounding a couple faced with betrayal. Through interviews with women who have chosen to remain with a husband who was the adulterer in these cases, Stuart answers questions such as:<br /><br />* What is Jesus' view of infidelity?<br /><br />* What are the reasons for infidelity?<br /><br />* Why do men cheat?<br /><br />* Why do women stay?<br /><br />* Can infidelity also be a form of domestic violence?<br /><br />* What are the consequences of infidelity, including spiritual, psychological, and emotional.<br /><br />* If divorce is the result, what happens next?<br /><br />With easy to understand prose and well-organized text that flows logically and naturally, Stuart provides the modern world with a tool that can change lives. Based in God's Word, the principles and problem-solving scenarios she suggests are doable and healing. Perhaps by understanding infidelity on a deeper level, we can then choose to defeat its infiltration into today's society of married couples.<br /><br />Stuart has given us a manual into treating those who suffer from the sin of adultery and is clear that not all cases result in forgiveness and healing. Realistic in her conclusion, she recognizes that healing begins with the victim who must take the first step.<br /><br />Both secular and Christian readers can benefit from reading Betrayal. If you are a victim of adultery, are an adulterer, know someone affected by adultery, or are in a position to counsel a person involved with adulterer, read this book. When you are finished, pass it on. Our world needs the kind of medicine Dr. Stuart dispenses through her dispenser filled with healing words.ult in forgiveness and healing.

This was just in the first chapter.<br /><br />The remainder of my night was shot as I stayed awake, reading each page as quickly as possible so that I might know this woman was okay. That she recovered. That she escaped her abuser and survived.<br /><br />Intense doesn't begin to describe Beyond the Tears. This writer's true story reads like a best-selling thriller - but it's not fiction. It's Tolson's nightmare that begins the story and her victorious survival that ends it.<br /><br />Peopled with characters we all know in our own lives, Tolson brings her own cast alive with crisp dialogue and action - oftentimes breathtaking with brutal honesty. Tolson's abuse cycle started as a child and continued through her marriage. The pages turn on their own as this compelling true story shows the cycle of abuse, the mindset of the victim, the actions of the abuser, the betrayal of relatives and friends and finally, the first steps toward healing.<br /><br />As I suspected when reading Tolson's story, her true calling was to be a writer, which she revealed in a subsequent interview. She is now working on her second survival story - this time she has survived breast cancer.<br /><br />Beyond the Tears is critical reading for victims of abuse. Through Tolson's story, many will recognize themselves, their families, their spouses, their friends, and from there, recognize that they, too, can heal-even when death seems like the best solution.<br /><br />Tolson says it best in this quote from her website, \\"In the meantime, know that my purpose as Lynn C. Tolson is in my initials: LCT, Learning, Creating, Teaching, to provide empowerment of our minds, bodies, and spirits. May this generation break the silence that surrounds sexual assault and incest so that future generations may live in peace.\\"ite, \\"In the meantime, know that my purpose as Lynn C.

But what about the body of an abused woman? Is she still beautiful? Can her body be beautiful? Photographer and author Jan Goff-LaFontaine met with forty women, aged 19 to 95, all survivors of abuse. She photographed them in the nude to celebrate their ownership of their bodies after experiencing the victory of surviving abuse.<br /><br />Women in Shadow and Light is not a book for voyeurs or those seeking a thrill. Instead, it is a deeply moving tribute to womanhood, in particular, to women who have survived abuse. Each woman allowed the part of her body she most associated with her personal experience of abuse to be photographed-only now that body part is seen victoriously.<br /><br />Completely shot in black and white, the images in this book are not just works of art-they are works of love, celebration, hope, triumph, and acceptance. Their beauty is enhanced as the meaning of the portrait becomes clearer, using a narrative in the subject's own words as well as notes by the author. Some portraits include a post-interview letter from the women speaking about the experience of the photo shoot.<br /><br />In Jan's own words, \\"I wanted to make the book a celebration of the strength and beauty of women; a reclaiming of their own joy and a gift of hope to others.\\"<br /><br />Why choose nude portraiture to offer hope? Jan says, \\"The question haunting me was: how can we change our perception-and even influence society's concept-of what it means to be a beautiful woman? My vision was to allow each of the women to help create her own portrait in order to see her body in a new way; to see it as beautiful and precious. To see it as a work of art.\\"<br /><br />I recommend Women in Shadow and Light for all women who are recovering from abuse; for counselors and pastors to share with those seeking affirmation. It is an inspiring tribute to the power of a woman and the beauty that arises out of the ashes of a fire that once threatened to suffocate the essence of God's most stunning creation: woman.<br /><br />Two quotes from participants in Women in Shadow and Light:<br /><br />\\"It's truly a gift to be part of this, and to be able to speak up, knowing that my story of courage can inspire others. Instead of feeling small and damaged, I am brave, I have healed, and I am an example of how others can heal, too.\\"-Cheryl<br /><br />\\"I'd like to hold out hope to other women...to let them know they aren't alone; they aren't the only ones these things happened to, and they can survive.\\"-Ellie<br /><br />Jan Goff-LaFontaine is a photographer and writer who is dedicated to bringing awareness and healing through art.

And cake. Readers will delight in the hometown feel of the book's pacing and long for the simple life, with a few mysteries thrown in, such as that in the much-loved Mayberry RFD scenarios. Only instead of the Carolina's, David's Bridge is a small town in Virginia; and as in all small towns, its residents, their individual habits, hobbies and quirks define the character of the place. David's Bridge is no exception.<br /><br />Bailey has inherited her father's investigating business, as well as the law enforcement relationships he built. As her father's daughter, Bailey not only continues to fill her father's shoes, but adds a feminine flair as well. Single, smart and savvy, this heroine is ripe for romance and intrigue-but she also enjoys hot cocoa and spending time with her cat, Eddy, when he's not destroying her favorite bunny slippers.<br /><br />The \\"mystery\\" of David's Bridge is multi-layered, beginning with a simple set of background checks on candidates for Jaqueline Ranier's personal assistant. Ranier, along with her husband, owns Triple Oaks, a wealthy horse farm.<br /><br />A bigger mystery is uncovered, though, after torrential rainfalls reveal the bones of a long-missing womanizer whose favorite prey were the women of the area estates. How do background checks on prospective employees tie in with an unsolved murder? This question keeps the pages turning in David's Bridge.<br /><br />The candidates seem simple, at first. Grace, an 18-year-old local airhead with no experience, except in the field of man shopping; Tammy, a shy but talented seamstress and typist, and a horse lover to boot; and Valerie, presently employed as a personal secretary at another large horse farm near Charlottesville.<br /><br />As Bailey begins her investigation, unusual facts about each candidate become known and pique her interest to go a step further and find out the underlying motivation of each of the applicants. Bailey becomes curious, careful..., and conniving when a series of hang-up calls, a misspelled warning note and a threatening photo of Eddie the Cat follow one another early in the investigations.<br /><br />Pros: Interesting mysteries and a well-thought out twist tying them together. Characters are believable and interesting.<br /><br />Cons: Dialogue is a bit overdone (common in first novels) and unnecessary information slows the pace of the story. The back cover blurb should have guided the book's plotline-the touted mystery is not introduced until two-thirds of the way through. A flip-flop of the plot line could easily solve this problem.<br /><br />Recommendation: If you like quaint, hometown intrigue, this is the book for you, and more will follow. If you like fast-paced, sophisticated intrigue along the lines of Grisham and Sanford, this is not your cup of tea - but give it a try anyway, for a change of pace.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is an author to watch as she works out the kinks in plot development and writing style. With a few minor touch-ups, such as switching around the plot line and tightening the dialogue and narrative, The Mystery of David's Bridge is a more than a worthwhile read. It is a jewel to treasure and take out to rediscover time and again. I predict the next book in the series will be faster moving as the author has introduced the backstory in this first of the series. I will be reading the next book to follow Bailey Ferrol's escapades.begins her investigation, unusual facts about each candidate become known and pique her interest to go a step further and find out the underlying motivation of each of the applicants.

If you like fast-paced, sophisticated intrigue along the lines of Grisham and Sanford, this is not your cup of tea - but give it a try anyway, for a change of pace.  <br /> <br />Bottom line: This is an author to watch as she works out the kinks in plot development and writing style. With a few minor touch-ups, such as switching around the plot line and tightening the dialogue and narrative, The Mystery of David's Bridge is a more than a worthwhile read. It is a jewel to treasure and take out to rediscover time and again. I predict the next book in the series will be faster moving as the author has introduced the backstory in this first of the series. I will be reading the next book to follow Bailey Ferrol's escapades.  <br />	2005-09-13

The victim was killed by being struck by the very trains he loved.<br /><br />Considered a nuisance by some at the railroad, the retiree was a regular fixture at the railroad yards during the common workday. One of the railroad workers, in particular, is filled with animosity toward Mullins. Joining the suspect list are Mullins' heirs, a successful daughter and a deadbeat son, until shortly into the investigation the victim's house burns, and the son is found dead in the rubble.<br /><br />McCallister is challenged in this book to go forward without his partner who is recovering from cancer treatment. He misses his partner and the subtle reminders that came from him that God is in control of all things, even Mac's love life. As Mac fights his attraction to Bennett, she proves to be a brilliant young detective, and her abilities deliver a blow to Mac's ego, causing him to struggle on another level. When she fixes him up with the dynamic medical examiner, Mac struggles more and is fun to watch as he works himself through these situations.<br /><br />Terminal is a good read for those who like police procedurals and carries the tone of one experienced in police work-for good reason. Co-author Harrison James is a supervisor of a major metropolitan Police Department and whose background includes working as an undercover narcotics agent, homicide and sexual/physical abuse detective, and he has also unforced big-game poaching laws in back-country investigations. He's also made appearances in several of today's police/crime reality shows.<br /><br />Patricia Rushford has written four serial mysteries. She is an award-winning author, speaker, teacher, registered nurse and holds a Masters in counseling.<br /><br />Terminal delivers with tension, conflict, a good mystery and subtle character growth. It is the third in the McCallister series, following Secrets, Lies and Alibis and Deadfall..  <br /> <br />Terminal delivers with tension, conflict, a good mystery and subtle character growth.

Funny and outrageous, Flynn pulls no punches as he pokes fun at religion in general and Baptists in particular. A Baptist himself, Flynn has intimate knowledge of himself in that role and uses that knowledge to call himself to order.<br /><br />\\"Do Have a Rapture Lawyer?\\", \\"Questions Mormons Never Ask,\\" and \\"Mission to Mexico\\" are guaranteed to have you rolling and coming away with a new outlook.<br /><br />Other chapters explore such mysteries as to what happened after the stories told in the Bible. In a Paul Harvey kind of way, Flynn tells the rest of the story. We all remember the story of Jesus spitting on the ground and making mud to apply to the blind man's eyes. Flynn points out the ungratefulness of the human race in some of their worst moments, by depicting the healed blind man as having this conversation the following day with Jesus:<br /><br />\\"You have ruined my life. I can't read or write. I don't recognize numbers. I have no skills. And now my neighbors know I'm not blind. How can I beg? Are you going to let me starve?\\" And Jesus spat on the ground again. (see page 111)<br /><br />All in good fun, Flynn seeks to bring us to the forefront of awareness of our personal misdeeds, aggravating habits, and quickness to judge so we might use these stories to better ourselves and think more kindly of our neighbors. Flynn recognizes how easily we hide behind religion as an excuse to hate.<br /><br />Slouching Toward Zion would make a good gift book for those that like humor and can laugh at their selves as they open their minds and hearts to the possibility of forgiveness and letting go of those things that hinder their spiritual growth. It could also be used to liven up some study groups.<br /><br />Flynn is the native of Chillicothe, Texas, and the author of eight other novels.s. <br /> <br />Flynn is the native of Chillicothe, Texas, and the author of eight other novels. <br />	2005-09-01

He has accumulated a plethora of preacher stories, some of the more comical he has shared in this anthology.<br /><br />In the preface, Pann states that he hopes to encourage \\"every Pastor who has ever strapped it back on come Monday morning.\\" He further hopes to encourage lay people and pastors alike to \\"press on, to remind ourselves that we're not alone in the fight, and recall there are many sides to the ministry we often forget.\\"<br /><br />With chapters titled, \\"I'm Going to Shoot Me a Preacher,\\" \\"Almost Dead,\\" \\"The Bible Doesn't Say That,\\" and \\"The Perils of Visitation,\\" Pann illustrates his ability to both laugh at life and learn from the most observed situations.<br /><br />20 stories about being a preacher, the people he comes into contact with, and why, complete the short story collection.<br /><br />The title story, \\"A Pregnant Woman Beat Me,\\" relates his trials and tribulations as a runner - a form of exercise began to ward off heart disease complications. In his self-deprecating way, Dr. Pann tells of his noble effort to finish the race, and in the process, being left in the dust by a six-month pregnant woman, a grandmother and various others, some qualified as geezers. The author uses this experience to illustrate how God uses our desires and activity to keep us going -<br /><br />while keeping us humble.<br /><br />Fans of Father Tim and the Jan Karon Mitford series will enjoy the escapades of Pastor Pann.	2005-09-01

But Billy Goat Hill isn't just a story about childhood and coming-of-age. It's a narrative about emotional and physical survival, the power and positive imprint a stranger can leave on a young life; and the rewards that a stubbornness to overcome can bring.<br /><br />The Parker family is trying to recover from the death of an infant brother, and a mother's grief tends to distance her from her two living sons. Lucinda, as Wade refers to his mother, is a lost soul, and 8-year old Wade assigns himself the responsibility to care for his foundering family.<br /><br />Earl, the Parker brothers' father, is mostly missing; a carefree alcoholic who can't seem to connect with his role as a father. Wade wonders how life might be different if Duke Snider, the famous player for the Dodgers, were his father, instead. Wade weighs most of his major life decisions as a child against what Duke might think, say or do, and it's a running theme throughout the book.<br /><br />But Wade Parker's most urgent dilemma at 8-years-old is completing a dare to ride a cardboard sled down the infamous Billy Goat Hill on the outskirts of Los Angeles. It's during his early morning escapade, which involves sneaking out of the house with his six-year-old brother, Luke, that the Parker brothers first meet a man and woman who will forever influence their young lives.<br /><br />Convinced they will be killed for witnessing what looks like a motorcycle gang confrontation, the young Parkers instead become fascinated with a dynamic couple they first know as Scar and Miss Cherry, both of whom are police officers and who are in on a prank to initiate a rookie officer.<br /><br />From that moment, the Parker boys form a lifelong bond with Scar, aka Sergeant, and Miss Cherry.<br /><br />At times, the Sergeant and/or Miss Cherry are absent from the continuing lives of the Parker boys; and the incidents that separate the foursome are such that tend to happen in life, but still birth the question of \\"why.\\"<br /><br />Also running throughout the story line is a thread of Christianity, which gets picked up off and on through dilemmas and the people who come into a life. Like a needle slipping in and out of fabric, it nicely ties the story together and brings all the pieces together like a well-made quilt.<br /><br />This is not intended as a touchy-feely feel-good book; but it is a well-above-average, satisfying read that leaves a good feeling behind anyway.<br /><br />Morris writes with a lyrical voice and uses vivid, innovating descriptions that beg to be read aloud. Morris was born and raised in Southern California, a background that brings a richness to the setting for Billy Goat Hill.<br /><br />Told in first person from Wade's point of view, Billy Goat Hill spans the defining years of childhood and early adulthood, throws in some life events in the middle and ends with Wade at 40 years old and coming into his fullness as a man of God.are police officers and who are in on a prank to initiate a rookie officer.  <br /> <br />From that moment, the Parker boys form a lifelong bond with Scar, aka Sergeant, and Miss Cherry.  <br /> <br />At times, the Sergeant and/or Miss Cherry are absent from the continuing lives of the Parker boys; and the incidents that separate the foursome are such that tend to happen in life, but still birth the question of \\"why.\\" <br /> <br />Also running throughout the story line is a thread of Christianity, which gets picked up off and on through dilemmas and the people who come into a life.

Written by 94-year-old Raymond M. Saunders, (now 95), BLESSED, I'M SO DAMNED GRATEFUL, is a book every household should have. What better way to experience a century of history than through the eyes of one of its sons. Saunders shares the beauty of life lived simply, with purpose, and with foresight. Above all, his tale is one that proves the beauty of the celebration of family in its most honest form.<br /><br />Saunders doesn't tiptoe around sensitive issues such as the murder suicide committed by his great grandparents which left a family of six orphans behind. Nor does he wax eloquent on the subsequent rise and success of his grandfather in the cattle business in Iowa. Rather, he has written a story penned for his family that begs to be shared in a larger audience.<br /><br />Throughout the reading of BLESSED, I experienced something that doesn't often happen - that is of \\"hearing\\" the author speak. Throughout each page, each era, each memory, running through my inner mind was the voice of a man who has lived life to the fullest and recognized the lessons we are meant to learn.<br /><br />Saunders decided to write some memories for his family when his eyesight began to fail in the early 1990's, and he introduces each chapter with a vignette into his day on the Iowa farm he still lives on today and grew up on for 95 years. Then, prompted by a memory, he begins a journey into the past that is rich with description.<br /><br />Especially noteworthy is Saunders' honesty with human foibles. Accepting them, recognizing them, and working through them. The world as a whole can learn from this unique historical memoir that documents the wide and varied changes in technology, family values and world events over the past 95 years and more.<br /><br />A unique portion of this special book is the numerous, well-preserved documents and photographs that illustrate the different events Saunders portrays in his written legacy.<br /><br />If only all generations had such an engaging, forthright historian willing to share the history of our immigrant families I believe our country would find deeper value and meaning in our every day lives and recognize the importance of living life.<br /><br />My only regret is not being able to meet in person Raymond Saunders. I would willingly sit at his feet for hours and listen to whatever tale he cared to share. A natural storyteller, Saunders has blessed America with this story, and I'm more than grateful to have had the honor to become engrossed in history made alive through the voice of an Iowa farmer.<br /><br />Interview with Raymond M.

Her comparison of love, judging a new love based on the past stuck with me, as did her poem, \\"Somebody's Everything.\\"<br /><br />Gomez explores through poetry some of the darker sides of love, such as the loneliness of unforgiveness, one-sided love and cutting the ties of love when necessary.<br /><br />I'll look forward to more works from this writer as she matures in technique and gains experience.

No one can quite figure out what genre he's writing in, though. Is it fiction, fantasy, science fiction, thriller, mystery, Christian fiction? He's crossed genres in all of his books and perhaps that's what makes his work so appealing.<br /><br />OBSESSED is Dekker's eleventh book, which combines mystery with a huge dose of suspense; historical fiction with compelling characters; and a quiet introduction to the true power and meaning of love. OBSESSED has something for everyone.<br /><br />It begins in 1973 with young real-estate broker, Stephen Friedman, whose mother disappeared after the Holocaust. He's a brilliant moneymaker, living a quiet lifestyle and seems content-until a phone call propels him into a madcap race to discover a treasure, his past, and possibly the love of his life.<br /><br />OBSESSED takes the reader on a journey into two eras with alternating storylines. In 1973, Stephen's quest to discover the truth of his past and recover a treasure pits him against villain Roth Braun, the offspring of Gerhard Braun, an SS Officer during the Holocaust.<br /><br />Dekker is a master at creating suspense with his creepy villains and boy/girl next-door heroes. Stephen is not athletic, his reasoning is skewed at times, and his courage is pulled from the depths of his being. As his obsession leads him into dangerous territory, a battle for his life and for others, the questions of exactly how is he going to prevail keeps the pages turning. The touches of humor in OBSESSED are a new device used by Dekker. But it works.<br /><br />OBSESSED explores the question, \\"how far would you go\\" to retrieve a treasure? To discover your past? To find the love of your life? To protect the ones you love? To seek revenge on the ones you hate?<br /><br />The theme in OBSESSED mirrors that in many of Dekker's books - the obsessive actions of a person in pursuit of his heart's desire, be that a possession, a person, or a god. Dekker also uses this compelling storyline to introduce readers to the parallel obsession of God in His never-ending pursuit of human hearts.possession, a person, or a god.

She shares her personal experience of applying each concept to her life and illustrates how it then translates into discovery of one's self, which can then better express the words residing within us.<br /><br />Searching for the meaning of our lives through writing is addressed with a reminder to return to the Bible and explore famous writing incidents such as the handwriting on the wall and the creation of the Ten Commandments.

The choice is his.<br /><br />Dianne Morgan is the CEO of one of the top two software companies in the world; and she is enraged by the government's humiliating decision in an anti-trust trial. She's also a member of The Domain, a group of computer programmers dedicated to taking control. . .of the world. They collectively have designed \\"PeaceMaker,\\" a virus built into the most popular computer operating system in the world. Its function: to overtake 90% of the world's computers and cause a disaster, to which Dianne Morgan and company can miraculously appear and offer help.<br /><br />Morgan recruits Brown, a former lover, to help her, though Brown distrusts her motives. He agrees, if only to prohibit implementation of the plan, because he has seen one of the possible effects of the program-the personalized computer of his eldest son, David, is infected, and it is in the process of destroying the young man's mind - and ultimately his life.<br /><br />But another company knows about \\"PeaceMaker,\\" and its goal is more sinister than Morgan's company.<br /><br />Morgan proves to be a sympathetic character at times, but for the most part, she's psychotic and controls men with blatant sexual advances.<br /><br />The other female supporting character also turns out to be morally corrupt and enjoys participating in sexual activity in front of an audience.<br /><br />The portrayal of these two women, at times, reads like a letter to Penthouse, and it almost caused me to quit reading the book. The scenes did not add to or move the plot forward, and their deletion (i.e. ignore them) actually propels the fast-paced action forward at a more appropriate pace.<br /><br />The sexual content aside, the book is a fascinating look at a possible future, with scenarios caused by fanatical idealists (terrorists). The premise is thought provoking and disturbing-what if?<br /><br />Ray Brown is a grand hero, a flawed man who manages to rise above his self, and in spite of those who want to see him fail, perseveres. I rooted for this nondescript character to overcome the odds, and that's what makes a novel worthwhile.<br /><br />In the end, I was glad I didn't fling the book across the room in exasperation at the gratuitous sex scenes.<br /><br />The story is ideal for the big-screen, and I wouldn't be surprised at its success under a sharp screenplay adaptation.<br /><br />Bottom line: Intrigue, slightly futuristic, plausible storyline with a likeable hero.<br /><br />The author, Dan Ronco, brings to the book his experience with Microsoft and other technology companies at the senior management level. His background in research and product development, as well as knowledge about existing software gives \\"PeaceMaker\\" above-average credibility.<br /><br />Interview with Dan Ronco<br /><br />by Dian Moore<br /><br />DIAN: I've found some of your biography online, and I know you are well-versed in software design and implementation and hold not one, but two Masters' Degrees: Nuclear Engineering and Computer Science. I read you once designed submarine nuclear reactors, but then moved on to the world of software design, research and development. What prompted the change?<br /><br />DAN RONCO: I discovered that I enjoyed software development much more than reactor engineering. I was hooked the first time I wrote a computer program.  I'm still hooked.<br /><br />DIAN: What was the seed that planted the story of \\"PeaceMaker\\" in your imagination?<br /><br />DAN RONCO: The inspiration for the story came from the rapid growth of worms and viruses throughout the 1990's.  As you may know, Microsoft was and continues to be the primary target of virus writers due to the popularity of its software.  My mind focused one day on worst case possibilities and I realized the danger of a sophisticated virus to Windows, which is the platform for much of the information processing across the globe.<br /><br />DIAN: The story that unfolds in \\"PeaceMaker\\" is one that I can see coming to fruition as technology continues to advance. What are your thoughts? Do you see terrorism by software as an impending threat?<br /><br />DAN RONCO: Yes, software terrorism is already a threat, and it will become even worse over time. When a virus attacks Windows, someone has to detect and report the problem, other people have to develop and distribute a fix, and millions of users have to apply the fix.  A relatively slow process, but it works as long as the virus isn't too destructive, doesn't spread too fast (or secretly) and doesn't evolve too rapidly (the fix won't work if the virus can change tactics).  In \\"PeaceMaker\\", I envisioned a fictional virus attack that exceeded these parameters.  At some point within the next decade, a terrorist may be capable of launching such a sophisticated attack.<br /><br />DIAN: How much of Ray Brown's character is that of your own?<br /><br />DAN RONCO: I share Ray's love for technology and his sometimes quirky sense of humor.  The rest - the intellectual brilliance, hard-edged intolerance, alcoholism, and infidelity - is not uncommon in such a high pressure occupation as information technology.  Ray is a composite of several people I've worked with in the industry, with just a dash of myself.<br /><br />DIAN: \\"PeaceMaker\\" is your first novel. How did you go from technology guru to writing a book, and what process did you use to get into the heads of the characters?<br /><br />DAN RONCO: After more than two decades in the IT business, I felt that it was time to do something else.  Although I loved the work, 70 hour weeks and heavy travel take a toll.  Besides, I had been thinking about writing a novel for years, but hadn't made much progress.  It was time to choose.  So I quit my job and concentrated on writing.<br /><br />The characters are composites of people I've met over the years, often taken to the extreme.  As a consultant, I have had the opportunity to work with all types of people - from CEO's to IT professionals to assembly workers in the line.  I began \\"PeaceMaker\\" by defining the core characteristics and motivations of the lead characters, then let them drive the story.<br /><br />DIAN: As part of the story in \\"PeaceMaker,\\" some pretty evil villains surface with advanced weapons and they aren't afraid of killing. Your background lies mainly in intellectual expertise, including technology. How did you research or determine how the violence would play out?<br /><br />DAN RONCO: I had an advantage - if you want to call it that - growing up in Newark, NJ.  Violence was all around.  Understanding the motivation, capabilities and limits of the more violent characters was a survival skill.  This may be surprising, but violence is not unknown among IT professionals.  I've seen fights break out and chairs tossed through windows!  I supplemented my experience with research into terrorism, since Dianne and her group were, at core, software terrorists.<br /><br />DIAN: How long did it take to write \\"PeaceMaker?\\"<br /><br />DAN RONCO: Approximately four years, although not on a full-time basis.  During that time period, I developed a fairly detailed outline for all three books in the series and prepared a preliminary draft of the second book, in addition to completing \\"PeaceMaker\\".<br /><br />DIAN: With the success of this first novel, what lessons have you learned as a writer, and what changes would you make if you could start over?<br /><br />DAN RONCO: When I started, I had no idea how difficult it is to write well.  I thought that once you had the concept for the story, the words would just tumble out of your mind onto the page.  Man, was I wrong.  I just went over to my bookshelf and counted the number of books on writing that I own.  Thirty-seven books!  Add to that the countless hours I've spent analyzing other writers' work, attending my writer's group and rewriting my own work.  Extremely difficult, but what a feeling of satisfaction when you get it right.<br /><br />DIAN: \\"PeaceMaker\\" has been touted as the first of a trilogy. Will the characters from this book also be in the others? What are the next books about?<br /><br />DAN RONCO: The \\"PeaceMaker\\" trilogy dramatizes the question: how much technology is too much?  The first novel, as you know, illustrates the consequences of a runaway, lethal computer virus.  \\"The Army of God,\\" set in 2022, considers the meaning of being human as artificial intelligence begins to approach human intelligence.  The last of the trilogy, set in 2025 and tentatively titled \\"Tomorrow's Children,\\" considers the risks and benefits of genetic engineering.  The lead characters - Dianne Morgan, Ray Brown and his son David - appear in all three books.  New characters also populate in each book.<br /><br />DIAN: My only complaint with \\"PeaceMaker\\" was the graphic depiction of the female characters as immoral, Penthouse-type figures. In my review, I make brief mention of that, and I re-read over those sections of the book with those parts concealed to see if they were necessary. I found they were not necessary to the plot movement, and they tended to slow the story down. As a female reader, I felt insulted and let down that no ordinary, moral women played a part in the story. Why did you include those devices in the story?<br /><br />DAN RONCO: I assume you're referring primarily to Dianne Morgan.  Although she has many admirable qualities, Dianne is the chief villain of the trilogy.  Ray is attracted to her because of her intelligence, determination, charisma and, yes, her sexuality.  Although Dianne admires Ray, her feelings for him are a distant second to her drive for power.  The twisted attraction between these two is not resolved until the last page.<br /><br />The supporting female characters vary in character.  Among the more honorable are Nancy, Ray's former wife, and Linda Tidesco, a top software developer.<br /><br />DIAN: Can we look forward to a likeable female character in future books?<br /><br />DAN RONCO: I believe you'll like Kathy Bauman, as well as her lover, David Brown.  Kathy and David swim through a sea of predators, both male and female, in \\"The Army of God.\\"<br /><br />DIAN: I'm definitely hooked on Ray Brown and techno-wars, and overall I give this book a 3½ out of 5 stars rating. I feel, with very little effort, your next book(s) has great potential to succeed in both the science fiction and thriller genres, and that \\"PeaceMaker\\" would be adaptable to the big-screen. Are there movie plans?<br /><br />DAN RONCO: I'd love to see \\"PeaceMaker\\" on the big screen, but nothing is in the works yet.es of people I've met over the years, often taken to the extreme.

Jordan writes back, and Bart is in deep trouble for breaking the confidentiality of Heaven. To avoid exposure he agrees to correspond with Jordan, and the story unfolds, told entirely in emails.<br /><br />I recommend that people of all ages read this small book with a big message. Better yet, all ages should read this book together, as a family, with friends, and in school. Yes, in a public school.<br /><br />Without preaching, Collier has created a masterpiece of communication full of vivid details, which appear in the reader's mind through short, web-ese emails.<br /><br />By the end of the story, I was amazed, and touched, to realize I had finished a story of remarkable dimensions. Though written for the middle-school-aged child (tweener), BARTHPENN@HEAVEN.ORG strikes a chord in the adult heart as well.<br /><br />Kindness, good deeds and learning the importance of empathy are explored, and Collier shows readers, through this story, how our actions cause ripples in the ocean of human life, affecting ourselves and the people we come to know. The importance of love and friendships without judging one another are illustrated as Jordan interacts with his family, schoolmates and an angel who also has a lesson to learn.<br /><br />Interview with Kevin Scott Collier, author of BARTHPENN@HEAVEN.ORG<br /><br />Interviewed by Dian Moore<br /><br />Q. What was your inspiration for a book written entirely in e-mail form?<br /><br />A: It just came to me, from a joke I told a child. He asked me if I prayed to God, and I responded, \\"No, I email him instead!\\" Then, the wheels in my head started turning. I started seeing the entire concept in my head, of a book that is both inspirational, and tech oriented for children.<br /><br />Q. What is your ultimate dream - your hopes from the publication of this book?<br /><br />A: To inspire children. To reach out and make people think, both young and old. I'm not in it for fame or fortune, I'm on a pathway my creator has put me on. This is about using my gifts for a spiritual purpose.<br /><br />Q. When did you begin to write, and what types of things did you write?<br /><br />A: I actually began as an artist, at age 5. But, with the creation of characters, stories had to be told, so writing was a natural companion to illustration. I mainly created, wrote, and illustrated Super Heroes, and made my own comic books which I sold to neighborhood kids. I pretty much had my own humble little publishing company by age 13.<br /><br />Q. Tell us a little of your background - where you grew up, family composition, hobbies and current life.<br /><br />A: I was born and raised in Muskegon, Michigan in 1957. It was a foundry town, my dad worked as an automotive pattern maker, and mom was a full time mother raising us five kids; I have 3 brothers, 1 sister. I was really into art as a kid, cartooning in particular, and still am today. I have a lot of strange and dangerous hobbies, like Parasailing and Sand Boarding to name a few. My family has a cottage on a lake, we pull a parachute behind our powerboat, and go sailing up to 500 feet in the air. I have a few surfboards I surf down huge sand dunes with too, some hills as high as 10 stories. I've had a few mishaps there! I love to ride my mountain bike everywhere too, and average 1,500 - 2,800 miles a year recreational biking.<br /><br />Q. Will there be a sequel to Barthpenn?<br /><br />A: The ending of the book is set up to lead to a sequel, and my publisher, Baker Trittin Press has opened the door for one. We're just going to see how much impact it has before I begin a second one. And, I have many other books for them in the works, so I'd like to get out new things before revisiting<br /><br />something I've done.<br /><br />Q. How about a book for adults, in the same format - would you do one? If so, why, and if no, why not.<br /><br />A: Actually, \\"barthpenn@heaven.org\\", and all of my upcoming titles, are for parents, too. My publisher is aware of this, and supports the concept. It's a way to reach and touch kids and adults for more of a blanket audience. My next book, \\"Esther's Channel\\", on the surface, looks like a little tale about a turtle and her friends, but it's really about adult behavior that unites and divides us.<br /><br />Q. When determining what type of job an angel might hold, how did you come up with the \\"workforce.\\"<br /><br />A: It all sort of fell into place. Heaven was going to be shaken up with a breach in security, and thus there has to be an angelic food chain as well, different levels all trying to manage a crisis. It's whimsical! I think the funniest part is Bart the angel's superiors (St. Andrew and St. Hawthorne) trying to keep the \\"misguided email\\" sent to Jordon Mink a secret of sorts from God Almighty. Yeah, right! God knew this all was going to happen before<br /><br />any of it did!<br /><br />Q. Who is the inspiration for Jordan's character?<br /><br />A: It's me, but I didn't do it intentionally. My wife says I drew so much on my past that Jordon became me. I did have a situation when I was 16, where I had a burst appendix, and spent a month in the hospital. I almost died, and I was very spiritual, and felt I had a guardian angel there watching over me.<br /><br />Q. Feel free to talk at length about anything you would like readers of this book to know.<br /><br />A: There are a lot of messages in BART (as I call the book), but perhaps the  best message is to never make negative assumptions. There are so many situations in the book where assumptions are made about others that turn out to be totally wrong. Get to KNOW others. Negative assumptions caused Jordon to misjudge Mr. Baxter, the elderly man with Alzheimer's disease, and a misjudgment of Brandon's character (Jordon's friend) nearly cost the two their friendship. It isn't until we get to know others, and use compassion and wisdom and hope as our guide, do others begin to unfold for us in our lives. You really begin to see what life is all about when your heart becomes your eyes. And, we all affect one another, and influence others. It's like they book says, \\"by the end of our lives we become a collection of everyone who ever loved us.\\" You will miss out on many good people by misjudging them or making assumptions.<br /><br />***/> <br />Q.

Nappa employs delightful, tongue-in-cheek scenarios to illustrate some of the main points, such as The Chocolate Touch and Naomi's Diary.<br /><br />Nappa explores the many ways a woman's actions can leave marks on the lives of loved ones, friends, and strangers.  She challenges women to recognize the permanent record of their own prints left behind through actions, words and touching.  Are your prints leaving a bruise or are they lifting people to God's higher touch?  Does your touch cause pain in someone's life or does it promote healing?<br /><br />The book consists of ten chapters, each divided into short sections illustrating the different types of touches a woman may experience either through her own actions or the actions of others:<br /><br />* Your Fingerprints Are All Over the Place! - The Mark of a Woman's Touch<br />* He Touched Me - God's Touch on Your Life<br />* The Touch Treatment - Helping the Hurting<br />* As Good as New - The Touch of Restoration<br />* A Gentle Touch - The Soft Caress of God's Love<br />* Home, Sweet Home - Touching Your Family<br />* Won't You Be My Neighbor? - Touching Your Community<br />* The Hands of God - Touching in and through Your Church<br />* Touch and Go - Random Touches Both Near and Far<br />* I'm Touched - Touching Your Own Heart<br /><br />This book encourages women to discover their spiritual gifts and offers advice on how to find out what those gifts really are.

Either her father stops drinking, or she's cutting her hair.<br /><br />Her father, lawyer Regan Candolin, doesn't care much for Lolly's ultimatum, and after she cuts her hair, he forces her to wear an itchy, wool cap over the mess she's made on her head. But that's not all. A firm believer in consequences, the unlikable Candolin forces Lolly to accompany him to the levee, where he proceeds to dump her old, best-friend cat.<br /><br />At times disturbing, perhaps because of its realistic voyeurism into a home wrought with alcoholism and mean-spiritedness, Lessons from the Gypsy Camp is riveting.<br /><br />Lolly proceeds to look for her cat, Bo, and visits the other side of the levee where all children of good upbringing are forbid to go - this book's equivalent to the `other side of the tracks.' While there, Lolly befriends Tick, a young-girl home-schooled by her healer mother, Sophia.<br /><br />The other residents of the small trailer park also take a liking to Lolly and add layers to this novel, which keeps the pages turning. Meet Maltilda and Ducky, a husband and wife who are determined to outdo each other in their threats to kill each other; Bob Bob, a literal giant of a man who never misses a shot but misses the subtle meanings of life; and Sam, a man in love with Sophia who owns a cougar, which is Cougarville's secret.<br /><br />Lolly becomes more involved daily with the residents of Cougarville and discovers more than she needs to know at ten-years old. She also manages to draw her grandfather into her secret visits which results in his being wounded by the cougar.<br /><br />She is horrified and angry at the people of Cougarville, but doesn't realize the full ramifications of her actions. The sheriff proceeds to kill the cougar; the sheriff is murdered; and Sam is tried for the murder.<br /><br />Lolly discovers more secrets and her knowledge leads her to testify against her father in court as he proceeds to prosecute Sam in the murder of the town's sheriff.<br /><br />Though the book is fascinating, the prose at times slips to read like a young-adult novel, which this is not. The subjects of alcoholism, cruelty to animals, grudges, revenge, murder and insanity clash with the storytelling style.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book for unsophisticated young readers, as the images portrayed are vivid enough to leave disturbed marks in a child's mind.<br /><br />On the other hand, I would have liked to seen this story told in a more adult style to fit the adult sophistication level of the material. Though children today face horrid circumstances, and the events portrayed reveal both the best and worst of humankind, Appel's approach leaves the adult wanting more; but provides too much too much information for a child to absorb and process without an educated parent's firm and guided supervision..

Christian writers will particularly enjoy \\"HowMaster\\" as Gigliotti shows how her writing is enhanced when including the Creator in its production.  I was grateful for the reminder that all we have to do is ask our Creator for guidance.  When God is our inspiration, a masterpiece is born.  By the end of the first chapter of \\"HowMaster\\", I had started a new notebook with thoughts and ideas sparked by Gigliotti's words and my own plea to the Master.<br /><br />\\"HowMaster\\" includes seven informative chapters to guide writers in accumulating a body of work that can be drawn upon repeatedly through our own experiences, observations and feelings.

She encourages writers to write through the ups and downs we all experience in life and cautions against throwing away personal journaling.  Instead, she advises to set the most painful journal entries aside, sealed, to await the day when a writer may need to draw upon that experience. An essay example in \\"HowMaster\\" by Gigliotti shows the value of recording perceptions when, or soon after, we have them, so as not to forget the passion of the moment.<br /><br />\\"HowMaster\\" provides us with step-by-step instructions to create beautifully written stories, articles and essays.

Page Turner A+	Robin Finley is just weeks from turning 18 when her mother, Tiffany, dies, leaving instructions that Robin live with an Uncle she had never heard of.  She is forced to leave California for small-town, Lorens in Wisconsin.<br /><br />Eager to raise enough money to return to California when she turns 18, Robin takes a job in her uncle's bookstore.  Her first day on the job proves exciting as she first meets young Justin Landers, the town's local reporter; she finds Justin to be very nosy and annoying.<br /><br />Handsome Philip Barnstrum, on the other hand, also makes it a point to meet the pretty newcomer and soon sweeps her off her feet.  But Justin isn't deterred and seems to show up at every turn.  The men are opposites of each other, both in looks and manner, and Robin questions her reasoning when she finds herself attracted to both of them, despite Justin's aggravating ways.<br /><br />Philip and Justin are equally, but differently, interested in Robin's investigation of the truth about her mother's fall from the balcony of Ingerman Mansion.  Philip supports Robin's quest for the truth while Justin advises against it.<br /><br />Robin is suspicious of the circumstances that caused the fall and becomes more intrigued when she discovers Tiffany never remembered Christopher Renton, her fianc&eacute;, after she fell.  Old newspapers claimed that Renton found the unconscious Tiffany.  He had gone looking for her when she failed to be on time for a date.<br /><br />Robin explores her mother's old room and discovers Tiffany's diary, cleverly hidden inside the cover of novel.  The diary tells of a life much different than the one Tiffany had told her daughter.  Angry, but intrigued, Robin reads the diary and soon finds that there are more secrets about her mother.<br /><br />Tiffany had been an 18-year old budding reporter on assignment, researching the Mansion's history and the legend of Connie Ingerman; she had also fallen from the same balcony in 1851, but didn't survive.  Speculation at the time had Ms. Ingerman jumping from the balcony, crazed by grief from the death of her true love who was returning from the California Gold Rush to make her his wife.  Some said he had sent a map to Connie detailing where he hid his fortune for safekeeping until his return, though a map was never found.<br /><br />Through her mother's writing, Robin realizes the smart, witty and brave young woman who wrote in the diary was completely changed after the fall.  She remembers her mother as scatter-brained, forgetful and overprotective.<br /><br />The diary also records Tiffany's discovery of an old letter at the Mansion, which left clues to the location of the legendary treasure map.  Robin wonders, does the treasure map exist, and if it does, where is it?  What happened to Christopher Renton, her mother's supposed fianc&eacute;?  Was her mother pushed, or was the fall just an accident?  Robin's intuition tells her that her mother was pushed.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Philip proposes marriage and urges Robin to find the treasure map based on the clues in the letter.  Flattered by his attention, Robin accepts his proposal and searches for the map, eager to elope with her handsome beau and the legendary treasure.<br /><br />Justin just keeps popping up though, everywhere that Robin goes.  He is with her when she finds an old friend of her mother's, and the old friend seems to recognize Justin.  Robin questions her later and is shocked to find out that Justin Landers looks like her mother's old fianc&eacute;, Christopher Renton.  Robin is frightened and gives in to her fear, letting it drive her to make some risky decisions.<br /><br />In the page turning finale of \\"Past Suspicion,\\" Robin, Philip and Justin collide at the Mansion in a last desperate attempt to find the map and resolve the past.  And the balcony claims another victim.<br /><br />\\"Past Suspicion\\" is suitable for readers 12 and up and can hold the attention of readers through age 100.

In \\"Without Warning,\\" the first book in this series, Pastor John Cain and his daughter were touring the Holy Lands when they became separated. Cain's tour bus was hi-jacked by terrorists. Cain was able to stop part of the terrorist's plan, but he is now in the states and the government isn't doing enough to get his daughter back.<br /><br />The terrorist Cain defeated in the first novel, Marwan Dosha, is determined to win. His people have Cain's daughter. However, no trace of Jessica surfaces until two unlikely characters recognize the young girl. But until then, the search seems futile.<br /><br />Jessica Cain is 12-years old when the novel opens, and realizes she is the prisoner of the Palestinian Islam Jihad. Quick-witted and courageous, Jessica works on freeing herself in the middle of a strange land where she doesn't speak any of the languages, and where everyone seems to be an enemy.<br /><br />But the enemy has a face, too, in \\"Vanished,\\" and Jessica learns there are kindness, humanity and courage sprinkled throughout the human race, even in the midst of the most horrible situations.<br /><br />The action and fast-pace of this novel are remarkable and will challenge readers to finish it in one sitting-all 525 pages. The plot takes amazing twists and turns, and Tanneberg is genius at keeping the stakes high.<br /><br />The book alternates between Jessica's and her father's viewpoint, at once providing a look into the frustration of a parent and the panicked, but resourceful, actions of his child. A definite page-turner, \\"Vanished\\" is full of well-drawn characters, realistic emotion, excellent plotting and pacing, and it definitely doesn't fall into the chasm of boring fiction.<br /><br />Ultimately, Tanneberg has succeeded in portraying ordinary people who become righteous warriors of God in a thriller that might not only hold its own, but also out-distance mainstream novels.	2005-01-17

She has come to Green Springs Farm in Missouri with her six-year old daughter Natalie to set up shop in the old Darden's General Store.  Ronnie is a clay artist determined to make a life and business in the country for her and her daughter.<br /><br />The country boy is David M. Darden, CEO and President of one of the biggest discount department stores in the country.  He's 6'4\\" tall with strawberry blonde hair and just happens to own Darden's General Store which his Aunt Edna has leased to Ronnie.<br /><br />A simple game that Natalie has of sneaking up on Ronnie is the set up to the surprise first meeting of our two main characters.  Ronnie hears stealthy steps and decides to catch Nat first, and when she whirls and plants a kiss, it's on none other than Dave Darden.<br /><br />When Ronnie finds out that this is THE Dave Darden, she is mortified and determined to keep her distance.  After all, this is the man seen in the tabloids on the arm of flashy country singer, Tammi Hart.  But since Darden lives next door, keeping out of his way is just not possible.<br /><br />This is a classic love story of boy meets girl, boy makes girl mad, boy gets girl.

They flamed and fizzled in the velvety blackness of the night but, after their brief flash of light, the only thing left were two wire sticks covered with ash.

Such a short and simple statement, that holds great power. This simple fact was divinely revealed during the Holocaust for Corrie Ten Boom and her family, and in this book, HIDING PLACE, she shares what happened.<br /><br />Corrie, a native of Holland in her early 50's, became involved in the underground movement to hide Jews and others persecuted by the Germans. Holland was invaded by the Germans which made it very difficult to hide the refugees, as well as hide Corrie's role in their protection.  While hiding several refugees in a false room in her bedroom, Corrie and her sister Betsy, as well as their aged father are taken prisoner by the Germans.<br /><br />Corrie is ill, while Betsy has suffered from an ailment since childhood and has always been frail. They are separated and do not see each other for quite some time.<br /><br />While being moved to another prison, the sisters are reunited and Betsy, by example only, helps Corrie cement her faith in God as well as learn to rely on him and trust solely in him.<br /><br />Again and again, Corrie is able to hide her small bible that a kindly nurse was able to slip to her. She hid it through numerous, supervised showers and naked inspections. God's Hiding Place was in action.<br /><br />Fleas that disgusted the guards became another thing to thank God for, as they created a \\"Hiding Place\\" for Corrie and Betsy as they revealed God's word to other captives and were able to give new life and hope in God.<br /><br />The sisters endure many humiliations and hardships that no human being should ever have to even dream about. Throughout all, their faith in God is strengthened and the book gives example after example of how this faith is met by God.<br /><br />I wept while reading this book, and I was ashamed that I complain about small things: Whether or not my neck hurts today, or I'm put out because my favorite TV show isn't on. I fear that I would have died a very bitter person if I were in that circumstance. If I am faced with tribulation, I hope that I would not, but that I would instead remember and be inspired by Corrie's story.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />Yes<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />Honestly and humbly, reveals God's power in the worst of circumstances.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />None<br /><br />The Bottom Line<br /><br />Get this book and read it.

Pages that were stark in their honesty and gut-wrenching with their truths.<br /><br />Brenda Weber shares her story of inherited molestation and abuse that began at the age of four and continued in one form or another well into her adult life.  Not until her son, also molested, and also an abuser, is found out, does she realize the pattern.  She is not alone.<br /><br />This book is very important.  Woman AND men who have ever experienced abuse, sexual or otherwise, will recognize themselves on every page.<br /><br />Too many times, society inflicts its beliefs on the survivors of abuse, leaving them to feel helpless, hopeless and sometimes, to blame.  With I Promise Not to Tell, Weber unveils the truth behind these damaging behaviors.<br /><br />It's a curse thing.  It's a generational-curse thing.  It's an inherited thing.  Whatever society might want to call it-abuse is a bad thing.  And unfortunately, the people who experience abuse go on to be abused more, and sometimes become abusers themselves.  They also might pass on behavioral traits to their children, one of those traits being how to be a victim.  Victims can become both victim and abuser.<br /><br />As we journey with Weber along her incredibly honest path of discovery, we learn that her mother was abused.  In a flashback, Weber is astonished to discover that she, herself, was molested at the tender age of four.  Her subsequent relationships start badly and end badly.  She doesn't get it-until she DOES get it.<br /><br />Readers who have never experienced the cycle of abuse will be irritated with Weber for not making right choices; for playing the victim; for accepting abuse and running from one bad relationship to another.<br /><br />It is my hope that those same readers, people who have never experienced the cycle of abuse will finally realize that the person inside the storm can't see outside the cloud.<br /><br />My mother could be the woman in this book.  Right down to the bad choices in men, the repeated bad mistakes, and the false hope each new relationship brings.  Right down to passing along the behaviors, especially those of being a victim.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my mother died without realizing the full dynamics of the demons imposed upon her.  We still don't know who it was that molested my mother; she never gave a name.  But we do know it affected her life, and the lives of her children.  Three out of four children have been divorced.  The two girls have made repeated bad decisions concerning men.  I am one of them.<br /><br />Bravo, Ms. Weber!  Thank you for taking the blinders off and letting the world see the truth.d mistakes, and the false hope each new relationship brings.

Usually I have his books read in a few hours. This novel of Parker's was the exception.<br /><br />Hugger Mugger was not Parker's usual fast-moving, character-rich genre.<br /><br />Spenser is approached by a wealthy man and his daughter to investigate the seemingly assassination attempts against some race horses they own. Okay, this was weird to me and a plot line I found hard to imagine. Maybe this is why I don't read the Hillerman books - just can't get into the whole race-track thing.<br /><br />The absence of Hawk greatly reduces the Spenser character. So much of Spenser's character is revealed by his actions when he is with Hawk. Without Hawk to act as a mirror for Spenser, the Spenser character greatly lacked in depth.<br /><br />Susan is featured in the book but nothing new is revealed in the relationship. I was left feeling pretty ho-hum instead of secretly wishing Spenser were real.<br /><br />I was disappointed that Parker relied on Spenser's wry self-love to drive the novel. I got extremely tired of reading about Spenser's attractiveness and drinking habits, as well as wondering about the possibility of so many \\"beautiful people\\" in one place.<br /><br />The plot line was obvious from the beginning, unless I am becoming quite the detective myself! I won't give away the story, but warn readers to be prepared for an odd twist that just doesn't seem to flow.<br /><br />Compared to Parker's other books, Hugger Mugger suffers terribly.	2004-08-14
US	49618129	R3LCJNG7GASL1	0312205406	963436946	Hot Six	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Hot Six Sizzles	Janet Evanovich does it again. The sixth book in the Stephanie Plum series, HOT SIX, met most of my expectations. I am always disappointed when these books end and experience a feeling of being let-down. Personally, I think the books should be double the length!<br /><br />In HOT SIX, Stephanie deals with a smorgasbord of personal relationship problems. She is suckered into being a dog owner; Grandma Mazure moves in; Joe wants some \\"quality time\\", and Ranger drops by whenever he feels like it, much like a ghost.<br /><br />The main plot line of the book is Stephanie's unofficial search for Ranger who is suspected of killing a major crime figure. She refuses to take the case and only wants to reassure herself that Ranger is a) okay and b) he didn't commit the crime he's posted bond on. Her archenemy Joyce Barnhart is then given the case and Stephanie's subtle means of thwarting Joyce's attempts at catching Ranger are priceless and sprinkled throughout the book.<br /><br />Grandma's attempts at single living (albeit it with Stephanie) are all good for laughs. Her one-liners crack me up.<br /><br />Joe's growing devotion to Stephanie is getting interesting, but I admit, it wouldn't be as interesting if Ranger weren't thrown in the mix.<br /><br />Ranger magically appears and disappears when he needs to see Stephanie, and he does manage to sneak in a kiss that was very well written. He enlists Stephanie's help in finding out some things that may clear him, but then orders her to stay away when she becomes a target.<br /><br />The addition of Bob, the dog, creates some unusually funny background.<br /><br />But leave it to Stephanie. She manages (by accident) to become the cigarette chauffeur for a crime lord while she is staking out his son!<br /><br />The fun I have reading these books is priceless. My 18-year old daughter bought her own set of books to take to California with her because she loves them, too. I have heard there may be a movie made from these characters, and I can't wait, but hope the movie industry doesn't spoil the uniqueness and character of these lovable books.these characters, and I can't wait, but hope the movie industry doesn't spoil the uniqueness and character of these lovable books. <br />	2004-08-14

This, in turn, raises questions I feel I need to address in my own life. This particular book, The Indwelling, raised some interesting questions I had not yet answered in my own life:<br /><br />1. Am I taking responsibility for my fellow man, those closest to me and praying for them, helping them even though I don't like what they are doing? The characters of Hattie and Chaim and the Tribulation Force's continued efforts to help them really brought the lack of that spirit within me to light.<br /><br />2. Being human, I get angry, and could see myself plotting to kill some scumbag like Carpathia even though I know he's just going to be raised from the dead. I identify with Rayford and his guilt feelings when he finally owns up to the fact that he was trying to control events instead of letting God guide him. Hmmmm. I needed that reminder.<br /><br />3. Having to live during the tribulation would probably set a lot of people crazy. Me included. (I'm supremely grateful that I am saved and know that I can rely on God's grace to get me through such a time). My curiosity is tweaked, however, when I try to imagine people I know in the same situations. The characters being a tad bit out of character in this book seemed to go right along with the situation. Chloe has maternal instincts which are vibrating on \\"protect\\" mode in this book as she faces the possibility of Carpathia's forces finding her and her child in the safe house. Would she surrender the child or resort to murder to protect the baby from worse? What would you do? And here is the biggest message of all: Quit worrying about it, that's God's job!<br /><br />4. I also find myself consistently wondering and dwelling upon the most important question: Will the things I do and say today have enough of a good influence on those around me that I might help them not be left behind? Unfortunately, I also find myself consistently coming up short on this answer. But that is the beauty of these books. They tweak your brain cells and get your soul involved. The end result has be to be better than the beginning.<br /><br />I found this book to have the best written dialog compared to the previous books in the series. The first book suffered horribly from the stiffness of the dialog at time. However, I have noticed that I, too, become a little stiff when I try to talk about God. In this society, today, it is very difficult to talk to unbelievers, and when I look at that, I find the dialog a little easier to take. It is definitely coming along though and I didn't find the dialog grating on my nerves in \\"The Indwelling\\".<br /><br />The conversion of one of the main characters left me in tears. This scene was movingly written and stayed with me for quite some time after reading it. I hope the same happens to all those I love and all those I don't love.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next book!lf consistently coming up short on this answer.

Ronnie's surviving relatives don't think it's possible, but still, a small spark of hope is ignited that spurs Charlene out of the house to research the matter.<br /><br />The gut-wrenching, somewhat horrific peek into the decline of Charlene, spurred by her unhealed grief, is perhaps the most fascinating character rendition in \\"Strange but True.\\"  Charlene is bitter, holding tight to hate, afraid of what she might find if she allows her heart to soften.<br /><br />Philip finds himself a prisoner in Charlene's home, recovering from injuries he sustained from falling four flights onto a concrete sidewalk.

Reading a John Sanford PREY novel always leaves me feeling out of breath and high on adrenaline.  It sure beats exercise.  EASY PREY is no exception. The action is very fast-paced and the hero, Lucas Davenport, is an engaging character.  His rough and tough approach to crime solving is sometimes surprising.  At times, however, I find myself becoming exasperated with Lucas and want to tell him to grow up. More on that in a moment. EASY PREY has many exciting dips and twirls that left me re-thinking the villain(s) again and again. I like that.<br /><br />The initial crime that spurs Lucas Davenport's investigation is the murder of a young fashion model, Alie'e Maison (Ah-Lee-Ay May-sone). During the crime-scene work-up, another body is found locked in the bedroom closet.  The second body is Sandy Lansing, whose death is thought to be a by-product of the Maison murder.  This begins the investigation that revolves around Alie'e and her various hangers-on and family members. Unfortunately, this line of investigation gets the police nowhere, except to involve Lucas with one of the suspects, Jael Corbeau, a sister of one of the other suspects.  One of the surprising twists in the story is Jael turning up dead.<br /><br />While the mystery plot of this book definitely held my attention, I was disturbed by Lucas Davenport's immaturity in handling female relationships. I was struck by how odd the contrast of this 40-something, rakishly handsome, extremely talented man, and his junior-high school approach to women.<br /><br />This book, more than any of the other Prey novels, unsettled me in this area. I found it hard to reconcile this self-pleasing man to the man that is in such demand to solve crimes. I liked Lucas much better when he was in a steady relationship with Weather Karkinnen in previous novels. The re-introduction of Weather was interesting, but again, I was left disappointed. Lucas's attempts to have all of the women, all of the time, is quite tiresome.  In EASY PREY, Lucas's libido lessens the impact of the story line.<br /><br />There are too many brilliant plot twists to accurately summarize here, but I was not disappointed in the mystery of EASY PREY. Lucas's womanizing aside, this book was great, and I will look forward to the next one in the series.the time, is quite tiresome.

WISH YOU WELL has been on the bottom of my reading list since it's author, David Baldacci, left his successful suspense genre to write it. I know the man doesn't know me, but I felt personally let down. However, since I ran out of things to read, I forced myself to check it out.<br /><br />I loved this book.<br /><br />WISH YOU WELL tells the story of Lou, a 12-year old girl, and her 7-year old brother Oz, who find themselves transplanted from gritty, busy New York City to the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia in the early 1940's.  These children are suddenly thrust into this unfamiliar world after a car accident kills their father, a somewhat famous writer, and leaves their mother in a weird, vegetative state.  Lou and Oz have no other option but to go to their great-grandmother in the mountains, taking along their mother, Amanda. The children's great-grandmother Louisa takes the three of them in and sends the personal nurse on her way, to the great relief of the children.  Then she sets out to teach the children responsibility. Louisa, who is Lou's namesake, is fond of saying that \\"learning is best learned by doing, not showing.\\"<br /><br />Immediately I fell in love with the main character, twelve-year old Lou. She has enormous courage and a heightened sense of her self. She is thrilled to be given her father's room as she has always adored him.  I was surprised to discover Lou's vulnerability lies in wishing for greater love from her mother.  And since that chance at love may now be gone forever, Lou is desperate to gain it. She also feels that foolishly hoping for Amanda's recovery will only make the inevitable loss more unbearable, and tries to maintain a distance from her mother.  Grandmother Louisa, always wise, has Lou get to know her mother through letters that Amanda wrote to Louisa over the years. The scenes in which Lou reads these letters are very poignant. Lou's feelings become even more complicated when a small-town attorney friend begins to visit and read to Amanda and seems to be falling in love with her, even though she doesn't respond.<br /><br />Oz, the little boy, is somewhat fragile in the beginning of the book.  Oz has always been treated gently by those around him, and he has been over-protected by his mother. Lou is his self-appointed caretaker, more so now since their parents cannot care for him. He is a delight to watch as he questions and learns his way about the mountain and surprises Lou, as well as the reader, with his strength and courage.<br /><br />The two children befriend a mysterious mountain boy that seems to have done everything there is to do, and as a result know everything there is to know.  His mystifying past is something Lou is determined to uncover, and when she does, she grows another notch toward mature understanding of our fellow man.<br /><br />Grandmother Louisa is a fascinating character that has thrived, living on the mountain all of her life. She lives by the belief that everything she needs is right there on the mountain, and she has a firm, unshakable conviction that God will provide everything that is needed. Her gentle loving of the children and her selfless care of Amanda are just two traits that make her a formidable woman worth knowing.<br /><br />Like all good Baldacci novels, the suspense in WISH YOU WELL kept me reading and made me want to be in the story, helping Louisa, the children, Amanda, and the rest overcome the nasty obstacles Baldacci throws in their way.  Can Louisa's land be saved?  Can an abusive neighbor's wife give birth without the help of a midwife? Can the characters overcome the death of two others, one by stroke, and the other by accident?  Will Amanda wake up?  To name just a few.  Whew!<br /><br />WISH YOU WELL teaches a valuable lesson, and that is life is hard, but it can be lived well. And when lived without all the comforts of the world, builds character seldom found.

When the publisher announced a new Julie Garwood novel, I couldn't wait for it to hit the shelves and was worried that I wouldn't like it because this one would be set in modern days, a very different setting than Ms. Garwood's previous historical novels.<br /><br />Heartbreaker begins in the confessional on sweltering day. Tom Madden is the priest filling in for the regular priest and is just about to call it a day when he gets his one and only confession. It is a nut who promises to kill Tom's sister, Laurant, and who calls himself the Heartbreaker.<br /><br />Heartbreaker challenges Tom to reveal the confession (a big no-no in the Catholic church, confessions are sacred). Heartbreaker knows all about Tom's and Laurant's life, their habits and friends, and predicts that Tom will call in his FBI friend, Nick Buchanan for help. Well, he wasn't wrong. Nick comes to the aid of his friend and becomes Laurant's bodyguard. The couple pretend to be in love to draw out the killer, and of course, they fall in love for real.<br /><br />The book is predictable regarding the evolution of the romance between Laurant and Nick, but I can't complain. Laurant's stubbornness and vulnerability make her very attractive. Nick's old-fashioned sense of chivalry is charming, and I will admit to wishing there more of that kind of male protectiveness around today.<br /><br />Nick's fear of flying gives a comic tilt to the story as does Laurant's neighbors, a pair of elderly sisters that stick their noses in where they do(n't) belong.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed and heaved a great sigh of relief when I finished the book. I take these books and their authors personally and would have felt betrayed if the book was a bomb. Thank goodness it was good!<br /><br />I had the absolute wrong guy as the Heartbreaker and was thrilled to find out I was wrong. I hate too much predictability.	2004-08-14

Dr. Scarpetta is back from the hospital, wearing a cast. She is valiantly trying to pack a suitcase, embarrassed by the presence of her friend and fellow investigator, Capt. Pete Marino.  She is packing because the police have asked her to leave, an event that launches Kay on a journey unlike any she has ever experienced.<br /><br />Eleventh in author Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series, THE LAST PRECINCT captured me immediately and never let up, thrilling me with 450 pages of sharp and gritty Cornwell style.<br /><br />Without spilling the beans, readers will be drawn into these key plot elements:  Kay is betrayed.  Marino's vulnerability is shown.  Lucy is hiding something.  And Kay investigates Diane Bray's murder with Jaime Berger, a New York prosecuting attorney.  But Berger thinks Kay might be the killer.<br /><br />Guaranteed to keep you up all night and write these characters upon your heart forever.	2004-08-14
