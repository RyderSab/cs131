A true solution to chronic pain, not just hype and promises never kept.  Egoscue is right on the money with his excercises.  In my humble opinion, the exercises fire muscle spindle cells which are receptors in the muscles and joint mechano-receptors which are receptors in joints.  Increasing the firing of receptors increases the firing of impulses to the brain. Increased impulses to brain equals less pain. <br />Dr. Michael L.

Johnson	This is a very good book.  Much of the book is composed of recipes and the recipes are very good.  Will you lose weight??? Definitely!! I have had numerous patients who have lost anywhere form 25 to 80 pounds by following a low-carb diet.<BR> <BR>As a practicing chronic pain specialist for the past 21 years, I have found that chronic pain patients who have followed a low-carb diet are better able to manage their pain.  Please be aware that this is my personal observation as a clinician and there is no scientific evidence to support my observation that I am currently aware of. My theory is that the nerve cells or neurons and the neurotransmitters or chemicals that allow nerves to communicate are composed of proteins.  When a chronic pain patient consumes a lower carb/higher protein diet, they are increasing the impulses or frequency of firing of the neurons or nerve cells. Increased impulses equals less pain! <br />Dr. Michael L.
