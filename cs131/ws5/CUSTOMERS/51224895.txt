The first is not surprising, since back in 1890 William James defined Self Esteem = Success/Aspirations.  The controversy seems, on casual observation, to be a faux issue with the claim that schools prefer enhancing self-esteem to imparting subject matter.  Why should it come to an either/or dichotomy?<br />Stanley Coopersmith developed a series of self-esteem measures, and reported on the reliability and validity results in this book.  Probably casual readers might find this heavy going; but this information is necessary to put the research on a scientific basis.  <br />Coopersmith explores some of the chracteristics that distinguish children who are high in self-esteem from those who aren't.  Typically, the children who are higher in self-esteem tend to prefer challenges, and are less daunted by the prospect of failure.  (It's like, \\"I feel good about myself . . . . So I failed.  So what?  I still feel good about myself.\\"<br />Particularly informative is Coopersmith's inquiry into the family dynamics that are correlated with higher or lower levels of self-esteem.  Incidentally, the developmental psychology research has essentially supported these findings.  Thoughtful readers might glean some fine ideas for dealing with the multiple tasks of parenting.<br />In sum, this is a very thoughtful early work that launched self-esteem research.  It is recommended both for interested psychologists and lay people.  It is easily understandable, and gives some good ideas on how to rear children.	2003-01-29

This is a subtle novella of 17-year-old Cécile, recently released from a convent school and enjoying a semi-dissolute life while living with her playboy father and his mistress de jour, Elsa.  She lives only for the day, and is untroubled by her failure on her examination.  She is looking forward to years of pleasure and irresponsibility, until Anne, a friend of her mother's comes onto the scene and endeavors to change, nay tame, Cécile and her father.  <br />The conflict begins with Anne's response to Cécile's throwaway remark that the young girl makes when her father and mistress adjourn for an erotic interlude, which the older woman found to be vulgar.  Cécile soon finds that Anne has made her (Cécile) one of her projects.  The plot thickens, much like the motif of the summer's heat and humidity in the southern France setting of this novella.  Cécile has her own agenda, including havig a love affair with a young legal student. <br />This simple novella by Françoise Sagan makes a nice story in describing how her teenaged protagonist reacts toward being tamed by the serious and possibly officious older woman.  All of the major characters are well-drawn, and we are lured into a sympathy for each.  It has the tone of tragic inevitability that makes the dénouement ring true; but is quite lyric and compelling.  Sagan rings true in her sense of the adolescent, and BONJOUR TRISTESSE makes for a very rewarding work to read.	2003-01-26
US	51224895	R1T9YDX69YLIL3	0899661742	574940351	Seventeen	Books	4	17	17	N	N	A Great Novel of the Emotional Life of Adolescence	Writing novels about adolescence is difficult; either because the writer in intimately involved in the business of being an adolescent and has not as yet acquired the narrative skills, or because the adult writing about that developmental stage retrospectively colors his memories of how things were.  (Françoise Sagan's BONJOUR TRISTESSE is a happy example of a book written by an adolescent that effectively addresses that period.)<br />Newton Booth Tarkington had produced the PENROD series of juvenile novels before writing SEVENTEEN.  In this work, he narrates the summer of love (lower cased letters then) of William Sylvanus Baxter, who is smitten with Miss Lola Pratt, also known as &quot;the Baby Talk Girl&quot; because of her talking baby talk, endearing to William, but grating on the father of the girl whom she is visiting for the summer.  I read this book when I was an early teen; and years later read it to my then pre-teen daughter.  On both occasions I found it to be amusing and insightful.<br />William is a typical young boy who goes through a series of pratfalls and misadventures.  Like many of his status, he is clueless.  He tries to write, um, poetry.  A sure sign that his is smitten.  Tarkington is able to straddle the fence of finding humor in William's behavior without being unduly condescending.  <br />A young reviewer commented earlier that the emotions and behaviors of his characters where more like fourteen- or fifteen-year old adolescents.  I would have to agree with that perspective: from the standpoint of today's teens, if Tarkington's book were written recently, it would probably merit the title &quot;FOURTEEN.&quot;  Nevertheless, I think that SEVENTEEN was an accurate depiction of middle adolescents of that upper middle social class in that era in history.  Certainly, the average mid-teen is more worldly nowadays than back in the early part of the twentieth century (or even back in the 1960's).    <br />Readers fond of esoterica might find itinteresting that Lola is based on Rose O'Neill, who later on developed the Kewpie dolls that were so popular in the early part of the twentieth century.  <br />A caution should be made at this time: there are some passages in this book in which African-Americans are depicted cruelly and in an unnecessarily unflattering light.  We maybe should regard this book as reflecting too-typical of attitudes prevalent in that time, but not encourage the emulation of these attitudes. <br />I did find the device of the omniscent narrator to be intrusive at times, and Tarkington's way of tying things up at the end to be unconvincing, but still this is a great book.  I can truly say that it offers something for both the young reader and the adult.	2003-01-09

George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman series has delighted fiction readers for a generation.  What an anti-hero he has concocted, using the vile Harry Flashman character from Hughes's Tom Brown's School Days as his character.  In some ways, Harry is more in tune with the twentieth century temper than were those earnest manly little boys so dear to the Victorian readership.<br />Harry Flashman is vain, he's cowardly, he's a lecher.  He manages to get into a series of military misadventures, and this one recounts one of the biggest of history: the Charge of the Light Brigade.  Tennyson notwithstanding, that had been a SNAFU of the first order; it led to most of those brave soldiers being sacrificed while attempting to storm an impossible objective.    Our hero literally farts his way through the attack and gets taken prisoner by the Russians!<br />Sure enough, he escapes; and has additional adventures in remote Turkistan (present-day Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kirigistan, and Tajikistan), where the British and the Russians played the Great Game.  <br />The background for this book is well-researched, it is compatible with history, is well-paced, and is very interesting.  It includes numerous explanatory notes in the end of the book.  George MacDonald Fraser usually satisfies with his Flashman stories; and this is one of the best!	2003-01-06

Reading this visual novel by Kosuke Fujishima was a treat, indeed!  Consider its beginning: Keiichi Morisato, a loser student phones for a pizza, but gets the goddess help line instead and is offered a single wish.  His choice: for a goddess to stay with him always!  He thus is paired with the goddess Belldandy, and experiences a series of hilarious misadventures beginning with their being kicked out of his dorm room.  However, this allowed him to leave the company of his loutish housemates in preference for the company of a real goddess.<br />Belldandy and Keiichi encounter some surprising characters: an otaku (obsessive anime fan), a priest with an unusual mastery, a feckless, forlorn lover, a queen bee of a university scene, and the manipulative little sister!  These episodes set the stage for explaining circumstances that were unclear in previously-published works.  We find out more about our two main characters, including the abilities of Belldandy.  <br />The motif of a girl or woman with preternatural or magical capacities is found in other Japanese manga works, notably the equally delightful Lum Urusei Yatsura.  But Belldandy is unfailingly pleasant and serene: a true goddess in her patience with Keiichi and with the sometimes difficult ways of humans.  This provides an effective device for critiquing the ways of humanity and for exploring philosophical questions.<BR>   <BR>While Fujishima did change his style in later episodes, I found that his style in these early stories was also engaging.  Belldandy is beautiful, and sweet.  The artwork is interesting and dynamic: worth the price of the book in itself.  I recommend this book 100% and suspect that it might serve to lift up the spirits of someone who is having a bad day. It does for me!	2003-01-06

It was popular during the 1920's; but the combination of Coué's death and the fact that he was out of then-mainstream psychology led to its being eclipsed.<br />Poor Coué was a little too far ahead of the Zeitgeist.  It would have fit in better today with the development of cognitive psychology and the development of cognitive therapies.<br />Esstentially, Coué in this work emphasizes the role of positive thinking in self-improvement.  In this way he implicitly proposed bridging the gap between behavior and cognition, a concept offered over 250 years earlier by Blaise Pascal.  But can reciting a mantra involving positive thoughts improve one's outlook?  There is some evidence that it can.<br />Emile Coué offers a number of practical suggestions for cognitive self-improvement in this very readable work.  It is equally recommended for both the scholar in the history of psychology as well as the everyday reader seeking practical suggestions in management of thoughts.<br />So:  \\"Each day, and in every way, I am getting better and better.\\"  Putting a different cognitive spin on things can improve one's life.	2003-01-01

BLACK SILK is written in the style of those turn of the century and 1920's novels like the Forsythe Saga by John Galsworthy.  It's not at all the expected or what is current.  And it's quite good for what it is; but don't expect what Ivory usually provides.  This was an earlier book and one where she was obviously experimenting with style.  It is not like her beauty and the beasts books.  I actually like this book better because the style is more intricate and the character development much deeper.  The ending, however, is obviously tacked on to please what the publisher imagines to be the demands of the readers. [Hence my four stars.] I'm sorry that she didn't develop this style further.

In this work Rumiko Takahashi happily combines the classic droll story themes of Boccaccio and Balzac with totally absurd and preposterous elements to delight the imp or the anarchist in all of us.  <br />The plot draws on the eternal triangle: Ataru, a perennially prurient (and thus normal) teenaged boy, Princess Lum, a gorgeous alien who sports a tigerskin bikini and cute little horns, and Shinobu, a classmate of whom Ataru was originally smitten.  <br />Ataru saves the Earth by winning a game of tag with Lum (an absolutely hilarious episode!), but in the process gives Lum the impression that he has proposed marriage.  This provides the basis for a plot involving continual misunderstandings.  Lum has to keep Ataru in line by occasionally giving him shocks and making him the guniea pig for her dubious culinary skills.  Despite his success in saving the Earth, Ataru gets no respect but a lot of woe.  Having two girls is always too many: when Lum and Shinobu are involved, it seems at times that Ataru has two too many!  You see, Ataru has a permanently roving eye!  <br />Rumiko Takahashi employs incredible imagination in this work: sweet potato-eating duels, a shower of oil, a short monk, disappointed parents, a crow queen, an ex-fiancé of Lum, and a host of other characters.  But the plot centers around the threesome: the fickle Ataru, the long-suffering Shinobu, and the naive yet provocative Lum.  You have to like the characters; but secretly feel the most sympathy for the innocent Lum, whose qualities are not recognized by the blockheaded Ataru and who persists in being attracted to Shinobu instead (when not distracted by the babe de jour).<br />This is about as agreeable an introduction to manga as you might find; and most people will find the story to be hilarious and entertaining, the characters to be appealing and well-drawn, and the pacing to be effective.  Read this one first, and then read Ranma 1/2.  Both are worth reading.	2002-06-08
