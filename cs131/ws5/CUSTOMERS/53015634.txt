Even from reading the book's liner information, don't expect much in the way of originality in \\"The Double Eagle\\" by James Twining.  The author has eagerly jumped into the melee of this hot genre and actually comes out with some hope in this, his debut novel.<br /><br />Borrowing heavily from mega-successful fore-runners of the mystery/suspence idea, Twining's plot development, his characters, and style of writing certainly pay homage to the masters (Ludlum, Dan Brown, et. al) and \\"The Double Eagle\\" does provide for some fast-paced reading.  In addition, in keeping with the genre, his research into his subject also is presented in a readable, interesting manner.  Globe-hopping around the world (another characteristic of this type), Twining's characters feel right at home (London, Paris, Istanbul, Amsterdam).  The local color Twining provides, too, is good, particularly if you've actually visited these places.<br /><br />Plot development?  A thought-to-be extinct (due to Pres. Roosevelt's decision) 1933 golden double eagle turns up (inside the body of a former priest) and \\"the dogs of war\\" are let loose.  Riddle after riddle and question after question abound.  Jennifer Browne, who, indeed, is described as something out of [...], is the FBI agent who gets the nod. Coupled (pun to be intended) with Tom Kirk (Twining's foxy-in the sly sense-debut central hunk) , a former CIA man and now an international \\"jewel thief extraordinaire,\\" the pair make their way to the exciting climax (continue the run of puns here).  As our money's on Browne and Kirk, \\"The Double Eagle\\" moves forward quickly as this combination has to be unbeatable, not only in this book but in what promises to be a likely series.<br /><br />But good.  Nobel prize winning it's not, but if you're looking for something to read that should command your attention and keep you entertained, this book should do it.  If you're wanting originality in plot, characterization, or even dramatic effect, well, look elsewhere. But this one's a good (and even fun) one to read.  Really.ood (and even fun) one to read.  Really.	2005-09-05

Granted, this is an English translation and perhaps the original Italian is far superior. And to compare this author with any other other is just that: a comparison, as, simply put, any two items can be compared, if one wishes.<br /><br />Still, Camilleri and his Montalbano deserve their praise, for, indeed, this book was fun to read. Again, the author, in a quick rush at the end, ties up all loose ends in the final chapter (in a type of \\"in case you slow readers didn't get it\\" approach), as there were lots of loose ends.  His frenetic pace is reminiscent of a good foreign film, the quick and abrupt scene and character changes, the literary and intellectual symbolish (the shape of water!). Europeans apparently delight in this series and this author.<br /><br />Set in Sicily, the murder victim is found abandoned in his BMW in \\"the Pasture,\\" a place for illicit trysts of about any kind imaginable in Italy (or anywhere!).  His pants around his knees, it is apparent that he's had a heart attack after having sex.  Alas, our intrepid Montalbano (whether urbane or not) smells a dead fish and refuses to accept the cause of death, much to the consternation of his superiors (of which there are many-socially, politically, and religiously!).  As, true to form, the inspector is correct.<br /><br />Camilleri, like American expatriot Donna Leon with her Commissario Brunnetti series, pulls on punches when he readily implicates just about every aspect of  Italian society in what appears to be a cover-up.

The latest \\"Elizabethan theater Mystery featuring Nicholas Bracewell\\" by Edward Marston comes with no surprises and certainly nothing new in plot or character development. It's Marston, tried and true.<br /><br />The author, who doesn't write under any known pseudonyms, is well respected in the genre and, in addition to the Bracewell series,  writes the Domesday Book episodes, equally engrossing and well researched. Like his UK colleague Paul Doherty (who does write under a number of other names), his historical takes are absorbing!<br /><br />In \\"The Malevolent Comedy\\" we find Marston's stable (and staple) formula:  the nasty landlord, his equally nasty wife, the tempestuous Lawrence Firethorn (great actor that he is), Edmund Hoode (once again, \\"losing his Muse\\"), Barnaby Gill (the obnoxious gay clown), Richard Honeydew (the sweet young boy who plays the lead female roles), the trademark kidnappings (of course), etc., and, because it's a murder mystery, at least one body (usually a member of the cast).  And, naturally, Lord Westfield's Men (their company)in their intense rivalry with Banbury's Men is on the verge of losing (a) their reputation, (b) their license, (c) their theatre, etc.  Yes, you've read this in all the Nicholas Bracewell stories.<br /><br />Still, despite the fact that not much is new in this book, this series is well worth the read. I haven't missed a one and recommend this one heartily.  I wish Mr. Marston would give us something new, but until he does I'll continue to read the series.	2005-08-22

Not only has Harry \\"matured,\\" but it seems so has Ms Rowling and her incredibly popular style and subject matter.<br /><br />Filled at once with the usual HP mystique, intrigue, humor, intensity, and excellent character development, this book doesn't slow down from the opening page onward.  Record-breaking sales aside, \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" continues its hold on readers of all ages.<br /><br />Rowling, without missing a beat, picks up from where she interrupted.  The narrative doesn't weaken a bit as we find Harry, Ron, Hermione, the whole Hogwarts watch, all matching their wits as He-Whose-Name-Must-Not-Be-Mentioned continues his attack on decent folk (and wizards and their like) everywhere. This time, he's taken his attack front directly to the Muggles and we find a more universal concern.  Rowling pulls no punches (but provides quite a few surprises along the way) as her sixteen-year old protagonist works through not only his sixth year at Hogwarts, but another year in his search for his own identity, purpose, and destiny.<br /><br />\\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" is a book that's just about in everybody's hands already.

Historical mysteries generally find a soft spot in my reading-they are great diversions. The Egyptian historical mystery genre already has at least three excellent authors with their own excellent series and now Brad Geagley had debuted with what promises to be another exciting series of the Old World.<br /><br />In \\"Year of the Hyenas\\" Geagley presents Semerket, an anti-hero before his time,which happens to be 1153 BC! He's an investigator all right, but an unlikely one. A boozer, Semeket has some good credentials in the investigating business, but drink and women have taken their toll and \\"down and out\\" probably best describes him.<br /><br />Still, he's a character that we have no trouble respecting, once the story gets going. It's a murder investigation. A priestess has been found dead and with all the political, religious, social, and economic issues involved, actually the authorities really aren't interested in having the facts uncovered, much less an actual conviction. But \\"conviction\\" is what Semerket is about and, naturally, as the story unfolds, we find the usual stumbling blocks and obstacles, all of which Semerket is eventually able to negotiate.<br /><br />Geagley avoids being \\"too factual\\" and presents a fast moving-and actually delightful-read.	2005-07-12

Paul Doherty's Canterbury Tales series continues marching on to its path of medieval mystery success! In his latest episode, \\"The Hangman's Hymn,\\" Doherty singles out the Carpenter to be the teller of these \\"tall tales\\"! In fact, so far in this series, this one, the fifth, seems to be the best written, although perhaps not the most suspenseful.<br /><br />The merry group of pilgrims, numbering 29 in all if we recall our English lit days and according to Geoffrey Chaucer, are on their way to Canterbury to pay homage to their beloved Saint Thomas a Becket. These pilgrims have accepted the challenge by the host of the Tabard Inn, one Harry Bailey, to help pass the time by telling four stories each, two on the way and the others in return. All of this is to be narrated by Chaucer himself.<br /><br />Doherty steps in to help \\"the father of English literature,\\" some seven centuries later, by relating more of these tales and in so doing deserves much praise, not only for his abilities to capture the \\"spirit\\" of Chaucerian England but in presenting a modern version that easily holds the readers' attention.<br /><br />The carpenter's tale is a tale of gruesome, frightening murders, of hangings, of poisons, of evil incarnate, of witchcraft, and even a little romance! On their way to Canterbury the group comes upon a legal hanging, which causes a quick reaction of Simon Cotterill, the carpenter.<br /><br />As the pilgrims pause for the night, the carpenter begins to tell his story. This is no tale told by an idiot, but it is full of sound and fury, of deceit, of bravery-indeed, it's a story not easily put aside. In the story, three witches are hanged and, before their hanging, vow to extract vengeance on all who were involved in their execution. Murder and mayhem, as they say, follow. Doherty's story, of course, is a mystery and with his usual cleverness he's able to bring the culprits-the real ones-to justice.<br /><br />The other pilgrims are uneasy over this story and even begin to wonder if it's true, adding to the mystique of this series!

Philippa Morgan's debut novel \\"Chaucer and the House of Fame\\" is a welcome addition to the medieval mystery genre! Taking a page (or two) from history, as it were, Morgan gives us Geoffrey Chaucer (later to be known as the \\"father of English literature\\"), a young man on a state mission from John of Gaunt, King Edward's youngest son and a big part of the royal ruling family at that time.<br /><br />It is the time of the 100 Years War and the squabbles-deadly as they were-over French/English ownership of some of the minor kingdoms in France. Chaucer is on a secret diplomatic mission to Aquitaine to try to secure the support of Henri, Comte de Guyac, long an English supporter but now beginning to waver, as it appears the French may be winning. Accompanying Chaucer are his two aides, Alan and Ned.<br /><br />Ironically, in Morgan's story, Chaucer had been held prisoner by the Comte some ten years earlier and, as history notes, was eventually ransomed and returned safely to England. While in the Comte's care, Chaucer, young poet he was, falls in love with Rosamund, the beautiful wife of the Comte. Now, Chaucer (married and with his own family) is quite curious to see how he will be received!<br /><br />Leaving London in early May, the trio becomes involved in a number of deadly events along the way and they begin to doubt if they'll ever arrive in Aquitaine! Along the way, they team up with a group of actors (Loup's Troop), all the time being shadowed by as evil an antagonist you'll find by the assumed name of Hubert. The pace of the novel really picks up when, on the second day during a wild boar hunt, Henri, Comte de Guyac, is killed in what appears to be an accident. Chaucer senses that this is a murder.<br /><br />And as \\"murder will out,\\" now it is a race of time to solve not only this murder but to tie up all the other loose ends in the story, and there are many!<br /><br />Morgan, however, is quite up to handling the myriad directions the books takes us! For one, her characters do a credit even to Chaucer, as she's able to capture the essence that he would have wanted evoked: the bawdiness is there, the humor, the satire, the social significance, and, of course, Morgan adds the \\"murder mystery\\" aspect. She gives Chaucer much free reign (he's involved in telling his own tale to his aides at the same time he's trying to solve the murder) and,using the Chaucerian technique of the frame story, maintians full control of all aspects of a well-written novel.<br /><br />Fortunately for us, it appears that she's clearly set the basis for a series and a welcomed series it would be. Her Chaucer makes an excellent sleuth!!

In \\"The Magician's Death,\\" the 14th in Paul Doherty's popular Hugh Corbett English medieval series,<br /><br />we find the erstwhile Corbett doing what he does best: solving mysteries.  It's 1303 and Edward I of England and his nemesis Philip IV of France continue to joust for European superiority.  As the English king's \\"chief spy,\\" Corbett once again pits his wits against Philip's No. 1, Amoury de Craon. What's at stake are the \\"secrets\\" that reputedly Friar Roger Bacon had written in code. Both sides are trying deperately to find the \\"key\\" to Bacon's code, for, to them, this Friar/Scientist has untold secrets, secrets that would tip the balance of power, perhaps forever, to the one who discovers them first.<br /><br />  Thus, as both sides have copies of Bacon's work (\\"Secretus Secretorum), they agree to send envoys (headed by Corbett and De Craon) to Corfe Castle on the English side of the Channel to work out differences and possibly a solution to the secrets.<br /><br />  At the same time, a series of grisly murders (aren't they all?) has plagued wintry Corfe Castle and environs.  Young maidens have been found murdered, with no hint as to the perpetrator or motive.  Corbett vows to the families of these maidens that he will find and punish the murderer or murderers.<br /><br />  And added to these intrigues, Doherty fleshens this worthwhile episode  with the usual inter-dynamics of Corbett and his two aides, Ranulf and Chanson. Coupled with excellent local color and praiseworthy characterizations, Doherty's latest episode is his best.  \\"The Magician's Death\\" is longer and more fully developed.  Murder, intrigue, treachery, a little romance, and lots of action combine to give the reader an excellent read. Doherty's historical fiction (his other series included) flair makes his eras come alive and well worth the time it takes to read his works.	2005-07-03

Once again, he's in trouble with Blair (his boss) and once again Priscilla figures in in what most readers probably hope will be \\"the\\" time, when, for once and all they get married.<br /><br />Sigh, sigh, sigh. Nothing is changed in \\"Death of a Poisoned Pen.\\"  Taken by itself, or if one hasn't read all 20, perhaps the same old same old is new and innovative and creative and clever. Alas it's not.<br /><br />That said, however, Ms Beaton's following is huge and she continues to entertain nicely, thank you, even if she's not come up with anything new, creative, or clever (ala the later Agatha Christie works).  So that said, be prepared for the usual: but its a usual that I, for one, no doubt, will continue to read.  Violence aside, it's nice to read that SOME folks have virtue and moral turpitude (although Lochdubh has its share of those who don't!).  And as for local color, Ms Beaton, it seems, does capture the Scottish countryside well.	2005-06-30

Another episode in Donna Leon's Commissario Guido Brunetti series cannot come too soon! In this, the 14th book, Leon's inimitable policeman is once agan, well, inimitable. It<br /><br />was a dark, icy and anything sleepy wintry night in Venice, when suddenly five shots ring out, or so it goes. However, Leon's \\"Blood from a Stone\\" is anything but simple or trite.<br /><br />A young African man, a \\"vu compra\\" (one of the illegal immigrants known as \\"venditore ambulante,\\" who sell counterfeit designer luggage in the local squares) is shot dead by two<br /><br />men. It is so professionally done that when Brunetti arrives on the scene, there is little wonder that little or no evidence, save the dead body, remains. What does remain, however, is enough to trigger Brunetti's suspicion that this is no ordinary shooting and that darker, more sinister, even evil, forces lie simply beneath the surface.<br /><br />Thus, armed with his usual loyal team members (Signorina Ellatra and Sgt. Vianello,among others), Brunetti once again sets out to solve this case and once again he meets head on the opposition from his own superiors. By now, of course, Brunetti knows that<br /><br />there is a much bigger picture here and to tread lightly is an undestatement. Still, with his usual tenacity, teamed up with his own unique code of ethics (\\"for an Italian law officer\\"),<br /><br />he begins the investigation, which, as Leon usually does, leads us into waters where no angels (or sensible police chiefs) would dare to tread. \\"Blood from a Stone\\" looks into a red-hot international political picture, one very real and seems to know no boundaries, or even depths to which it extends. These socially significant issues generally transcend into Brunetti's personal life, his wife (an academician and healthy liberal in her own right at a Venezian university) and two children.

This time, though, Roger is not out on the road but spends this episode in great involvement at home with his family in Bristol.<br /><br />But it's not all peace and quite for our genial (and \\"nosey\\") peddlar in medieval England.  Early on, in seeking shelter  from an early storm in what is supposed to be an abandoned house, Roger finds himself assaulted, knocked out, and the awakens to be witness to a murder.  His assailants then unceremoniously dumps him into the river, where, mercifully, he is rescued before he drowns.<br /><br />However, bless his heart, no one believes his story of his life-threatening assault, much less the story of witnessing a murder.  His friends, family,  and other acquaintances dismiss these stories as rantings from a mind damaged by either an accident or drunkenness (neither is true, of course!).  Thus begins a compelling story by Sedley, probably one of the best of this series.  Roger, not content to let sleeping dogs lie, begins to nose around and as usual meets up with the \\"usual\\" complications. This time, however, the obstacles come from a larger source--the investigation soon becomes clear that national and international interests of royal nature are involved here and Roger is quickly warned to stay away. But our intrepid Roger doesn't, of course, and all the political and social machinations of the time come into focus and once more Roger saves the day (and a few crowns).<br /><br />\\"Midsummer Rose\\" is a fast-paced, fun read, with all kinds of intrigue, love interests, comic relief, and, of course, murder. Sedley's ability to capture the time and flavor in convincing historical detail is also a major factor in the series' success.	2005-03-24

It's not that simple, though.  Young Eris is<br /><br />something of a designing young woman whose sensuous abilities seem to outweigh her<br /><br />intellectual capacity.  She leads one young man, Tom Rawbone, to think he's her \\"intended,\\" but<br /><br />suddenly reveals she'll marry, instead, Tom's father Ned.  Needless to say, this causes quite a<br /><br />disruption.

Roger agrees, reluctantly (after all, he's promised to be in Bistol by March 17!) and<br /><br />from this point, Sedley's mystery plows on.  Village secrets abound, ages-old hostilities shine, and<br /><br />Roger even concludes that there is a connection between the disappearance of Eris and the deaths<br /><br />of two well-diggers over 150 years ago.<br /><br />  Aside from creating a character (Roger) who is fun AND interesting to know, Sedley's<br /><br />historical commentary seems sound as she effortlessly captures the tone and atmosphere of what<br /><br />15th century must have been like.  She also spins a good tale, cleverly matching the storyline with<br /><br />the symbols of nine men's morris, a popular game of the time.  This episode in the series, to me, is<br /><br />the most exciting and the fastest-paced one.  It's a good read, as is the entire series.series.	2005-03-08

It's hard to put down Tony Hillerman and his ever-so successful Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee mystery series. Hillerman evocation of the modern Navajo world is unparalleled and certainly has put the area on the all-time literary map.<br /><br />In \\"The Skeleton Man,\\"Hillerman's latest in the series, the author takes a compelling (albeit somewhat melodramatic) story--a plane crash 50 years ago over the Grand Canyon, a missing cache<br /><br />of diamonds that somehow start to emerge, and dead bodies. Mix in the subplots of Leaphorn himself and Jim Chee's love life, we have a story that is fast off the starting blocks. It should be enough to carry the book full force. Alas, while much of the action is compelling, the landscape and atmosphere effective, \\"The Skeleton Man\\" remains bare-bones and by the end seems to come unglued. Perhaps the Leaphorn/Chee stories<br /><br />have come to an end....as not much new is happening (well, Chee gets married--so it's good to get THAT out of the way, as he'd been whining for the last few novels!). Maybe a new angle, or even a new series--certainly no one is tired of the Native American approach.<br /><br />All this said, Hillerman fans will, no doubt, enjoy the adventure of reading \\"The Skeleton Man.\\" Hilllerman is Hillerman and a lapse in excitement and accomplishment does not mean he's to be written off. The book was worth the read and, as always, I won't hesitate to read future stories, with or without his famed duo.	2005-03-07

The author in each of these four takes a Shakespeare play as its literary theme--and so far so good.  This series, featuring the young player Nicholas Revill, is an excellent read, even if the reader isn't a scholar, or even fan, of The Bard.<br /><br />Nicholas, while trying very hard to make his way as a serious actor, seems to find himself, book by book, in nasty, fiendish, nefarious murder situations. Of course, Gooden is free with his references to Shakespeare (who also appears as a minor character) and this gives the series not only a unique flair but hints at serious writing!  This time around, Gooden treats us to \\"Troilus and Cressida\\" as his \\"central\\" theme play.<br /><br />We find young Nick heavily involved once again with the Chamberlain's Company. A boyhood friend comes to London seeking his own fame as an actor and turns to Nicholas for help.  Happy to see his longtime friend, Nicholas obliges and within a<br /><br />few days comes home to find his friend murdered!  Because he is found with the body, he is under investigation for the death of his friend.  Soon after, an up-and-coming playwright, who's about to publish a scandalous play, is found murdered; again, because of his involvement with the man, Nicholas is charged.<br /><br />Finally, Nicholas' long time and dear friend Nell is found strangled to death, by Nicholas' own clothing piece.  What's a boy to do under these circumstances?  He runs!  Back to his village, where he hopes to work things out.  Alas, things only get more complicated.<br /><br />Yet, all's well that ends well and once more our Nick escapes the nick, using some clever reasoning and intelligent deductive skills! \\"Alms for Oblivion\\" is a a fun read.

In \\"The Railway Detective,\\" Marston introduces us to Detective Inspector Robert Colbeck of the new Scotland Yard.  A charming, some<br /><br />say \\"dandy,\\" gentleman of the Victorian school, Colbeck seems an unlikely person for his job--solving cases and catching the crooks in 1850s England.<br /><br />  It is the dawn of the age of the locomotive and it does not come peaceably.  There are enough \\"foes\\" of this \\"new fangled contraption\\" and many will go to all ends to try to put a stop to it and the new Age that is surely dawning on the British Empire.<br /><br />  Early on we know who the culprits are, as Marston doesn't play games with the reader.  Instead, he permits Colbeck and his Sergeant Leeming to methodically put the pieces of the puzzle together and, despite the usual suspects and the usual<br /><br />obstacles, arrive at a satisfactory conclusion.<br /><br />  A train is highjacked in Chapter One and subsequently and deliberately de-railed. It is carrying gold bullion from the Royal Mint and the day's mail.  The robbery is carried out with true military precision (a clue Colbeck quickly picks up).<br /><br />It is such a perfect and professional job that Scotland Yard knows that there have to be \\"insiders\\" involved.  A few murders later (Colbeck cleverly links them to the robbery), the case is put to rest.<br /><br />  Marston doesn't do histrionics and not a lot of melodrama. Instead, he tells a story that not only serves to keep out interest in solving the crime but provides much readable background of the time and place. There's the usual violence in a police procedural murder mystery and Marston also throws in a limited romantic turn, too!<br /><br />  Marston's historical series (The Nicholas Bracewell Elizabethan mysteries, the Redmayne series, and the Domesday Books series) stand on their own merit.  The author jumps a few centuries and seems to fit right in.  That said, readers will hope for more in this interesting era.  (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)o fit right in.

Martha Grimes' eagerly awaited new Richard Jury mystery is another in a long line of police procedurals worth the wait.<br /><br />In \\"Winds of Change,\\" Grimes' characters get involved in pedophilia, child kidnapping, and, quite literally, a garden maze of labyrinthine proportions.  Grimes' regular characters once again prop up the plot as Jury sets out to solve the case, the 19th in her incredibly popular series.<br /><br />Granted, the sheer weight of the subject matter is cause for a dark, uneasy feeling with readers.  Grimes seems intent on this atmosphere and succeed she does.  Grimes has always had a soft spot for precocious children and the relationships she shows with them and Jury and Melrose Plant are always welcomed.<br /><br />Besides getting the case taken care of, Grimes' social statements are hard to ignore, one of the characteristics of a good book, I should think.  Jury is Jury, and Grimes spends more time in \\"Winds of Change\\" getting inside the psyche of him, which is not a bad thing, although noticeably she seems to drift away from much of her regular characters. And perhaps new readers may find some of the references and allusions to earlier books a bit confusing.<br /><br />But Jury is Jury!  He's worth the examination. So's the book.	2004-10-25

Through his connections with the French consul, he is dispatched on a diplomatic mission to the King Negus, of Abyssinia to try to open up diplomatic opportunities. It is a dangerous mission, as Christians are not welcomed following, some 50 years prior, the expulsion of the Jesuits from the area. And during the course of the book, Poncet has to confront many personal obstacles, both physically and emotionally.<br /><br />A \\"period piece\\" of the first water, \\"The Abyssinian\\" combines the typical melodrama of such a tine in literature-the daring adventures, the daring romances, the daring intrigues. Rufin seems to have captured well these characteristics as he's made a novel that is compelling to read, one that, despite the obvious melodrama, captures the reader's interest tout suite with lots of wit, creativity, and cleverness.<br /><br />To call this book \\"larger than life\\" is perhaps an understatement but it's what one would expect if it were written by 18th or 19th century novelists!

With his Toby Peters (private investigator) series, we go tongue in cheek with our erstwhile gumshoe detective-and willingly. In \\"To Catch a Spy,\\" Toby is hired to help out Cary Grant (Toby's resume with<br /><br />Hollywood figures include Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davis, Charlie Chaplin, and others).<br /><br />It's 1943 and America (and Hollywood) is caught up in the wartime fervor and patriotism. However, the sordid, domestic side of life continues, war or not, and Mr. Grant hires<br /><br />Toby to help him retrieve some \\"sensitive, personal documents,\\" no doubt compromising to the Hollywood heart throb! Alas and alack, there's the accompanying murder and Toby and Cary are off to the races (Grant, incidentally, is working for the British Intelligence Service), bungling, stumbling, and finally emerging victoriously (of course!).<br /><br />Kaminsky, a noted film historian, is right at home with the Hollywood setting. His wit, cleverness, and fast-paced writing make this series go right down to the wire with plenty of excitement, humor, and even adventure!<br /><br />This is the 22nd Peters episode and Kaminsky certainly has plenty of possible stars to put at Peters' disposal!

Joseph Kanon in his third novel captures, readily the tonal integrity, the dynamic symmerty, the<br /><br />full atmosphere of this traumatic time in history. Jake Geismar returns to Berlin to cover the Potsdam Conference, at least that's his cover.<br /><br />More knowledgeable than his colleagues know, Jake has spent time in Berlin before the war. He's now looking to pick up the pieces, perhaps more literally than one might think. At the center of his reasons for returning: to find Lena, the woman he loved-and left-because of the war. Jake finds Lena, but Lena's husband is missing. He's a top-rated mathematician and both the Russian and American intelligence agencies want him-badly.<br /><br />However, as the Conference is progressing, an American soldier's body is found in the Russian sector of Berlin. Thus begins what is certainly one of the tautest murder mystery thrillers lately.<br /><br />Yes, Kanon evokes LeCarre, Len Deighton, even Robert Ludlum in places, yet he holds his own with the riveting story line and Jake is a memorable character, one who easily combines romance with espionage, social significance with irony. Philosophic<br /><br />and poetic, Kanon's literary reach is broad, but not so much that it drags. The author, clearly in control of the plot development, cruises to a dramatic-and exciting-finish.

And while the cast and crew rush headlong into and through all kinds of dilemmas, intrigues, complications, and predicaments (and even funny situations!) that would otherwise be chaos, Bartle Bull certainly is in control of the entire literary picture here.<br /><br />Perhaps \\"fascination\\" is the noun to name my reaction to the book. Clever and creative, the book is more than a story line, more than just this collection of characters, as Bull gives us a reading experience worthy of our time.<br /><br />It's Kenya, just as World War I is ending, this part of the globe to British at the time represents a brave new world-one without the ravages of the Great War, politically, socially, economically, you name it. And it is to the White Rhino these expatriots and others gather, the \\"civilized\\" watering hole of Africa, all of the characters with personal agendas (and hangups!) of their own. Truly, Bull's characters make the book as adventure combines with romance which combines with a circus full of \\"exhibitions.\\"<br /><br />It is Lord Adam Penfold who brings together these characters. His hotel is the magnet that attracts them, for better or for worse, providing them with just about everything they hope for, within reason. The symbolism, of course, is not lost here. The clever and dangerous dwarf Olivio Alavedo, the Gypsy Anton Rider, and the Welch femme fatale Gwenn Llewelyn -they bring their private agendas to the front (lust, revenge, greed, jealousy-you name it!).

We find Sugar works at a brothel run by the ruthless (yes, even evil)  Mrs. Castaway (right out of Dickens!), and we are made aware of her dreams and desires to \\"get away from it all.\\" And, of course, Sugar gets her opportunity and thus begins this littany of characters, situations, and dilemmas, first and foremost  the wealthy William Rackham and his relatives and acquaintances. Faber's secondary characters are pure Dickensian and run the gamut of just about every unacceptable lifeform of the time!<br /><br /> Like Dickens, Faber's theme of class divisions, gender political issues, and other socially significant topics that today seem only matter of fact.  Faber, in this 800 plus \\"tome\\" pulls on punches and relies upon modern freedom of the press to discuss aspects of Sugar's life that Dickens couldn't have touched (even if he knew they existed!).  Still, with this length, Faber seems in control of the plot development, theme presentation, and characterizations.  Like Michael Chricton'' \\"Great Train Robbery\\" Faber clearly uncovers the Victorian \\"façade\\" of propriety and \\"high tea,\\" and especially the hypocrisy.

At his last birthday party, a seer approaches him to predict that before his next birthday, he will murder someone. Unsettling, of course, and Gideon finally yields to the intense pressure of such a prediction to arrange a meeting with Espinosa, in which he confesses of the prediction.

King Edward the Confessor has just died, and Anglo-Saxon England will never be the same.<br /><br />On his deathbed, the venerable Edward has bequeathed the crown to young Harold Godwineson. Harold is eager to assume the royal mantel and for a few moments, it appears as if the sovereign state leadership will pass easily from one to another.  Alas, as history and as Laurence J. Brown have it, it is not to be.  For across the Channel another awaits the call.  William the Bastard, later to be called the Conqueror, had also been promised the crown by Edward.  Thus begins perhaps one of the most famous years and military events in Western Civilization-the Norman Invasion.<br /><br />Brown, however, makes \\"Housecarl\\" more than a history lesson.  The title is the name of the king's specially-trained and favorite warriors (\\"the cream of the English army\\") and Harold's personal champion Ranulf Redbeard sets out to recruit others, as he knows that Harold will need all the help he can get.  The author presents expertly and candidly the complexities of this famous year, from Harold and William on down to the peasant stock.  Everyone is involved in the impending invasion from Normandy.  Even with a myriad of personal intrigues among the two central powers, yet there are others.  The King of Norway also feels he should be king of England (through a convulted network of genealogy) and even Harold's own brother Tostig seeks the crown.<br /><br />Ah, what a tangled web we weave.  Graphic and colorful, suspenseful and atmospheric, \\"Housecarl\\" not only gives us a very readable accounting of 1066 but of the individuals involved, real or otherwise.  It is a book not easily forgotten.  And a good read!	2004-09-22

It's quite good news to find yet another episode of the \\"sorrowful mysteries of Brother Athelstan\\"--he's been gone far too long for my taste! Now, Paul Doherty, prolific as he is, has returned to this series, my favorite of all of them.<br />In \\"The House of Shadows,\\" we find the good brother all involved with his parish and their annual mystery play for Christmas.<br />In past episodes we've shared not only his sorrows but his triumphs and joys, and most importantly his sleuthing skills. He loves a murder--to solve. And, once again,<br />he has not only one murder, but a series of them. What's a simple friar to do? Well, for starters, to solve them. And with his usual finesse and brilliance, he does.<br />Refreshing, too, is Doherty's depiction of Athelstan's Southwark, where, in addition to being the parish priest, he is secretarius, friend, and super sleuth to the Crown's<br />coroner Sir John Cranston. We are treated, too, to his beloved St. Erconwald's parish, with his cat Bonaventure, his horse Philomel, and the wide assortment of parishioners, all more than human! But this is also what endears his legions of fans<br />to him. England simply wouldn't be the same without the Good Brother!<br />Doherty has provided us another good read; let's hope he now has picked up this series for more episodes!

George Herman certainly deserves credit for not only writing a spirited, often hilarious, tale set in early 16th century Italy, but for taking, literally, the Literary Bull by the Horns and presenting a delightful, mesmerizing story with equally mesmerizing characters.<br />&quot;Carnival of Saints&quot; shows Herman's influence of some real masters, notably Boccaccio and Chaucer. This is no &quot;tale told by an idiot,&quot; to borrow Shakespeare, but it's a story of some original misfits, nine altogether, who are on a Grand Journey, metaphorically speaking, to right a few wrongs, as it were.  While Herman's story does not take the form of &quot;The Decameron&quot; or &quot;The Canterbury Tales,&quot; it certainly includes the bawdiness, the ribaldry, even the &quot;lessons&quot; these earlier masterpieces so clearly demonstrated.<br />These &quot;misfits&quot; early on recognize the fact that united they stand, devided they don't, and so with good fortunate, skill, and the Good Lord's blessings, their odyssey takes in the entire scope of Renaissance Italy, pulling no punches as some of the social, religious, and economic disorders of the time. Herman's wit clearly abounds and while readers wil find themselves caught up in the plot development the author's humor keeps everything in perspective. Well, almost.<br />These nine travelers, who represent a cross section of Italian society of the time, much as Chaucer did with his characters,<br />are ofttimes quite bumbling and seem their own worst enemies, yet the &quot;goodness&quot; of their souls always wins out.  This is a delightful read, and readers who aren't overly familiar (or fond of) Boccaccio or Chaucer will still find the historical setting<br />and atmosphere worth the time.  Herman has a number of well-received like books that also deserve a read!  (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2004-07-05

Michael Curtis Ford's credentials seem quite sound, and certainly he has provided us with an epic-length and epic-like novel of sixth century Greece.<br />Told by Theo, Xenophon's squire cum friend, this story certainly comes packed for wear.  Xeonphon has enlisted with the armies of Cyrus in Persia, having been among those Athenians disenfranchised by city leaders following her losses to Sparta. Cyrus is embattled in a civil war trying to capture the Persian crown which he feels belongs to him.<br />The book is not about Cyrus, though, and early on Cyrus is killed in one of the many battles of this campaign and eventually young Xenophon is left to lead the Greek mercenaries.  His job, following Cyrus' botched attempt, is to get his troops back to Greece.  This is really the story.<br />But getting his troops home is not an easy task. The story becomes one obstacle after another, usually in the form of enemy troops and Mother Nature (crossing the mountains in winter, for example). And, of course, scattered throughout are the examples of treachery, deceit, and a lot of mayhem.<br />While Xenophon is only gone for one year, Ford makes this novel seem longer than Moses in the desert (in which he foundered for 40 years!). Thankfully, Xenophon's tale is much shorter, although the book at times seems even longer.<br />Students of Greek history should find this an intriguing story, much of it based upon research done by Ford.  Certainly, the author has made these historical characters come to life.  He has also made the times and events quite realistic.  It is worth the time to read! (...)	2004-06-10

At least, this is the core of the plot.<br />Russell James has written a very intriguing mystery in which evil truly does become personified. This riviting story line usitlizes more threads that Clothos could contrive, but while it may bounce back and forth from one character to another, from one time period to another, it still contains a cohesion that is not difficult to admire.<br />For readers who have trouble reading stories of people who are truly evil, perhaps this one should not be undertaken. James' evil and demented characters puts him on a par with Patricia Highsmith.  The P.D. James, Martha Grimes, Donna Leon, Ruth Rendell police prodecurals feature super detective superintendents and each exhhibits murderers par excellence, still they don't seem to espouse this evilness in the characters that Russell James does here.  This is not to say that his characters and plot are not of excellent worth: they are.  James has presented us with some very, very bad characters; in fact, not any of the characters in the whole book have more \\"good\\" characteristics than they have \\"bad\\" ones. An interesting turn for a novelist to post.  And, certainly, his characters are none whom I would want to meet even in a brightly lit alley!  In addition, through the two sisters, James presents \\"the other side\\" of the Nazis without the book being a political statement.<br />It is very well written and has a few really clever and witty passages and references-affording some necessary comic relief in such a depressing tale.  The cleverness of the pun in the title serves as an example of this. (...)	2004-06-10

It's the exciting second episode of Simon Hawke's William Shakespeare-Tuck Smythe<br />medieval mystery series.  As with the previous, \\"Much Ado About Murder\\", \\"The Slaying of<br />the Shrew\\" is a fun read, a story of derring-do, intrigue, comedy, romance, and, of course,<br />murder!<br /> William Shakepeare is our hero, dropping couplets here, blank verse there, a little more<br />iambic pentameter over yonder, and on center stage.  What a clever--and readable--idea for a<br />stage-worthy series!<br />  As has been noted, much has been written about the Bard, but no one has made him out<br />to be an Elizabethan solver of murders as American author Hawke has.<br /> One does not need to be a Shakespearean authority to enjoy the mystery.  Hawke laces<br />his prose with often clever references to the original Shakespeare, tossing in a lines here and<br />there that, of course, \\"found\\" their way into one or more of the original plays.<br /> In this series, Shakespeare has not yet completed one play, although he has now<br />discovered he can at least pay the bills by writing sonnets on commision.  Young twenty-ish<br />Will works as a minor actor for the Queen's Men.  Shakespeare's friend Symington Smythe II<br />(Tuck), Shakespeare, and the entire troup have been hired to stage the entertainment for lavish<br />wedding of a noble's daughter, named Catherine.  Indeed, she's the byword for \\"shrew\\"; alas,<br />though, the best laid schemes of mice and the Queen's Men often go awry, and this is no<br />exception.  Catherine is found murdered and Hawke's rescuers and mystery-solvers leap to the<br />case.<br />  There plenty of suspects and it takes the brilliance of Shakespeare to narrow the field and<br />eventually solve the case.<br />  Solving the case, of course, really isn't the lure of this book (or the series).  Just getting to<br />know William Shakespeare is the fun part (although, of course, readers should remember that<br />his is purely fiction!).<br /> But the play's the thing, wherein they're bound to catch the conscience of the thing,<br />and through diligence, brilliance, and cleverness, well, all's well that end's well, to coin a<br />phrase.<br /> Indeed, \\"The Slaying of the Shrew\\" is a delightful book, whether one is versed in<br />Shakespeare or not.

Granted,<br />perhaps the style of writing, the wit,  and even the other nuances of the prose are due to the actual<br />translator's abilities (Andrew Bromfield), still this series promises to be popular here in America as well as in<br />Russia, where millions of copies of this series have been sold, we are told.<br />  Young Fandorin (21 or so) fast finds himself caught up in a series of bizarre incidents,<br />beginning with the suicide of a young student.  By chance, Fandorin indulges his<br />superior's \\"interest\\" in the suicide and then begins to unravel a far-reaching world of<br />intrigue, espinage, murder, and general mayhem, from Moscow to London and back.<br />  The murder plot aside, Akunin's period piece is good reading as he's able to capture the<br />atmosphere of late 19th century Russia, yet without judging it one way or the other.

Mr. Pearl's intelligent and intellectual approach in \\"The Dante Club\\" is refreshing to read; it also gives the opportunity for the reader to think and to understand Boston following the Civil War.<br />Using as principle characters Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and James Russell Lowell (among others), Pearl's murder scenario very cleverly surrounds--even is inundated by--Dante's \\"Divine Comedy.\\"  There's deaths aplenty, each a symbolic reference to one or more of Dante's \\"crimes in hell.\\"<br />What to do?

It's more than a &quot;lucky 13&quot; for Donna Leon. &quot;Doctored Evidence&quot; is a carefully-crafted, purposefully-written, and fully-fulfilling (typical!) Leon police procedural featuring my favorite Italian, Commissario Guido Brunetti.<br />The erstwhile policeman has been on holiday to Ireland when the death occurs (A Romanian cleaning woman supposedly murdered her employer and made off with a large sum of money, only to be apprehended at a border crossing; before police can take her into custody, she bolts and is killed by an on-coming train)and when he returns he has already dismissed the case, which he'd read about in the papers, as merely a &quot;cut and dried&quot; episode in the life of the police in Venice.<br />Of course, the death of the cleaning woman has suspicious and unusual circumstances and shortly after Brunetti returns to work, a neighbor of the dead woman reports to the police that she has proof that the woman is innocent. This, of course, really peaks Brunetti's interest and from that point on, Donna Leon is, well, Donna Leon.<br />Before the case is closed, of course, readers once again witness the inter-play between Brunetti and his associates, his family, and his beloved Venice. Leon is not shy about taking literary pot shots at a number of socially significant issues facing not only the Venezians, the Italians, but the rest of the world.<br />Step by step, Leon takes us to the conclusion, where, of course it's no secret, Brunetti's intellect, talent, and good will once more triumph.<br />&quot;Doctored Evidence&quot; continues the Leon reputation. What a fascinating series Leon has created. Tis a pity one has to wait a year for the next episode.	2004-04-15

Owing to a  devastating<br />brawl during one of their performances at the Queen's Head Inn, the troupe has to exit stage out-of-town, as so much damage has been done to the Inn and their stage proprieties,<br />there is nothing left for them but to head to Kent to recoup their losses.  A major injury to the players is that Barnaby Gill, their erstwhile clown, was injured (a broken leg) in the<br />melee.<br />  Alas, during said brawl a young man is found dead in the bleachers, a dagger sticking out of his back.  Nick and his colleagues know this is murder but cannot imagine<br />how it relates to them.<br /> But without a clown, the players know they cannot go on. Thus, when Nick recommends one Giddy Mussett, everyone stares askance at the suggestion. Giddy is known as a brawler, a drinker, and a lecher!  He is also in debtors prison.  After securing his release--and his promise to be on good behavior--Westfield's Men head for the country.<br /> And while the show must go on, it goes with much ado about murder and more mayhem. Someone is out to destroy the players.  And not far into their tour, Giddy is found<br />murdered.  It is for Nick to figure all this out.<br /> Marston, of course, takes us though the paces and by the final curtain, all's well that ends well.  It goes without saying, particularly if you'ver ead any of this series, that<br />Westfield's Men save the day.<br /> The author does an excellent job of staying in character--his historical mysteries also include The Domesday Book Series--and \\"The Vagabond Clown\\" is no exception.

Each of the McGee books contains a color in the title, easily recognizable.  And<br />it's not purple prose either!  MacDonald, a best-selling novelist for years, has more than<br />just a storyline to carry his books.<br /><br />Certainly, McGee is his principal concern.  He's &#34;retired&#34; most of the time and he only goes back<br />to work when he sees he's running out of money.  He'd rather stay aboard<br />his houseboat and entertain his friends than work.

It is amazing,<br />too, that in re-reading it here in the year 2000, the book still stands as relevant now as it was<br />then.  McGee, as usual, finds himself befriending and then helping out Cathy Kerr, who<br />has come to him in desperation.  Her misfortune has been to meet up with Junior Allen, &#34;a<br />smiling, freckle-face stranger&#34; with depravity on his mind and a more odious person you<br />don't want to meet.  There is also something about missing inheritance.  McGee is unable<br />to resist and from the moment he accepts the challenge, the reader is glued to the pages.<br />MacDonald's style is terse (some would say Hemingwayesque--one of MacDonald's favorite<br />writes, incidentally) and moves rapidly, a pace easy to keep up with but one that if you<br />blink, you might miss something.

In Kathy Hepinstall's second novel,  \\"Absence of Nectar,\\" the author continues to give readers a<br />taste of real, rural East Texas, this time in the 1970s, when Alice Fendar, an eleven year old,<br />narrates a tale to evoke more suspenseful local color than Carson McCullers ever could!<br />Young Alice readily states her objective in the opening pages:  \\"Get rid of Simon Jester.\\" Simon has suddenly descended upon the tranquility of Alice's home life, when he rescues her<br />mother from drowning one hot East Texas afternoon.  Meg, the mother, has recently been<br />abandoned (and divorced) by her husband and despite the efforts of Alice and her 14-year-old<br />brother Boone to cheer her up, her life has slowly and surely slid into statis.  Or worse.<br />Even her prize bees have begun dying due to her neglect. Hers is a life with the absence of nectar, and<br />without nectar, the \\"unexamined life is not worth living,\\" to quote Socrates.  The author's use of<br />this effective metaphor easily balances--and extends-- the book's theme.<br />But Simon's opportune appearance seems to be exactly what Meg needs and wants.  He moves<br />in; they soon become man and wife.<br />But Simon is an evil man; a man who certainly has a history of his own.  He decidedly does not<br />like his two step children and goes to great extents to develop \\"tests of loyalty\\"--which, of course,<br />they fail.  He prides himself as being \\"God's microphone\\" and justifies all his actions with<br />references to the Good Book.<br />And while Meg loves her children, her weakness for Simon is a<br />tragedy a-waiting. Alice and Boone deduce that Simon is actually going to poison them--they<br />spend hours researching various toxins and their characteristics; they refuse to eat anything that<br />Simon comes near.  Life grows more unbearable and late on night, Meg comes in to say good<br />night.  \\"Tears begin to roll from her eyes and a look crosses her face. She...takes a deep, painful<br />breath, leans down to us and whispers a wod that I know must cause her unbearable grief. Run.\\"<br />To call Alice precocious is perhaps an understatement.  Certainly for eleven years old, she is more<br />than merely perceptive.  In addition, she also loves her older brother very much.  Boone, himself,<br />is torn between juggling his own religious expectations and beliefs with his love for Persely Snow,<br />a teenage \\"monster\\" who continues to escape from an insane asylum, where she's been confined<br />for poisoning her own parents  And Boone is very, very much afraid of Simon Jester.<br />At times evocative of Richard Brautigan, Hepinstall's touch for the originality shines.  Alice has a<br />crush on a neighborhood boy, who doesn't seem to know she exists.  \\"Now he approached me<br />and watched me work, one shoulder slightly lifted, his arms still crossed, a little red in the eyes as<br />if the chlorine had followed him home like a bully and lived with him all winter.\\"<br />Alice's first person account of the story is riviting in most places, absorbing in the others.  She is a characer to<br />be reckoned with! All Hepinstall's characters certainly hold their own, in their own uniqueness and in the depths of<br />their presentation.<br />Whereas \\"House of Gentle Men\\" was more intriguing reading, \\"The Absence of Nectar\\" combines the intrigue of the setting, the plot, the characters with tightly controlled<br />suspense.  Mincing no words--and wasting no time--the author marches to the exciting climax of<br />the story--one that is not anticipated, yet it is not the traditional \\"surprise\\" ending.

The author of the very successful &quot;The English Assassin&quot; has a well-timed book that also involves the Church (did somebody say &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;?) and whispered (perhaps actual) conspiracies.<br />Silva's &quot;art restorer&quot; Gabriel Allon is called into play once again. We know Allon well from &quot;Assassin&quot; and here he is, once again, &quot;recalled into service.&quot; The Mossad agent is the perfect man for this job. Again, combining the fine arts, religious concatenations, and 21st century conspiracies, Silva makes his latest well worth the read. In this one, three central personalities figure in: Allon, the writer Benjamin Stern (or rather the life of Stern!), and the newly-elected Pope Paul VII.<br />It is difficult to find a more mesmerizing theme today than that of the Church's &quot;conspiracies.&quot; That said, of course, Silva's book is not entirely devoted to such a story line. In addition, the book is a Rand-McNally of Europe, as the characters bounce back and forth and across Europe's most exiting easels, and Allon is determined, that again, h e is not to be framed, chiseled, buffed into submission.<br />Excitement abounds (not to mention quite a few humanities/fine arts lessons). Highly recommended! (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2003-11-29

James and while some readers may have found &quot;The Murder Room&quot; faint in some areas, Dame James' latest Adam Dalgleish is, well, Adam Dalgleish. How can a reader go wrong?<br />Granted, James has given us a new twist (Adam is in love and her traditional police procedural takes a different turn. But before one cries &quot;soap opera,&quot; &quot;The Murder Room&quot; is not about Adam Dalgliesh's personal life. It is about a series of murder, a plot outline with which James is quite comfortable and her legions of fans come to expect.<br />Circumstances surround the undertakings (forgive the pun) of the Dupayne Museum,, a small, rather esoteric, museum devoted to the &quot;interwar years,&quot; the period in England from 1919 to 1939. However, the rub is that the lease on the museum is about to expire and the three trustees (siblings) must agree totally on its extension or else the museum cannot continue. One brother, Dr. Neville Dupayne, is dead set (forgive the pun again) against signing; thus the demise of the museum is at hand, it appears. Quickly into the book, the good doctor is found burned alive in very suspicious circumstances and just about everyone has a motive for seeing him dead. Commander Dalgleish and his team from New Scotland Yard are called in and before this death can be solved, two others follow, all with connections to the museum.<br />James clearly is in charge of this narrative and, as always, controls the pace and the revelations of the investigation. Dalgleish is, as always, superb. The resolution comes not through histrionics or melodrama, but the James/Dalgleish penchant for brilliance.<br />Is this James' best? Hmmmm. &quot;The best&quot; is probably the individual reader's personal choice, as I've yet to read a &quot;bad&quot; James, or even a &quot;poor&quot; one. &quot;The Murder Room&quot; joins the other dozen or so Dalglieshes comfortably. It is an excellent read. (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2003-11-29

Whether she's the reigning  \\"Queen of Crime\\" or not (and she probably doesn't care!),<br />P.D. James is unbeatable with the police procedural.  And her latest, \\"Death in Holy<br />Orders\\" is, once again, James par excellence. What scope, what depth, what sheer writing<br />talent when it comes to a gripping, mesmerizing, no-holds-barred whodunit!  James<br />brushes aside her critics and continues writing in the way she knows best, unassuming and<br />literate, psychological and breath-taking!<br />And her main man, Adam Dalgleish is back, along with his trusted assistants, Kate Miskin<br />and Piers Tarrant, as the superintendent enters ecclesiastical waters in this episode.  A<br />theological student has been found dead on the East Anglian shore, a tragedy ruled<br />\\"accidental.\\"  However, pressed by the student's father, Dalgleish re-examines the ruling<br />and James is off to the races in typical (read that \\"exciting\\") style.  Known as the \\"dark<br />poet of Scotland Yard,\\" Dalgleish finds himself, once again, in familiar territory, as he<br />recalls having visited the College of St. Anselm in his youth; however, momentary nostalgia<br />aside, he finds more than he could possibly have anticipated.  Of course, there is soon<br />another death and Dalgleish's own \\"little gray cells\\" begin working overtime!  Indeed, this<br />may be the more horrifying case he's encountered, as James explores evil as she's never<br />done before.<br />Once again, James takes some time to present Dalgleish, the man, as well.  Each of the<br />books in his series provides more and more insight into this incredibly complex policeman.<br />Dalgleish fans will welcome this, of course.  \\"Death in Holy Orders\\" is yet another of those<br />books that find themselves almost impossible to put down.

Due to the heavy rains the area of<br />Kingsmarkam is literally inundated, and it is first assumed, by some, that the three, Joanna Troy,<br />the baby sittter, and Giles and Sophie Dade, have simply drowned.  Of course, Rendell wouldn't<br />have it so simple and neither would her Inspector.  Before long the proverbial body is found and it's<br />Joanna.<br /> Now the hunt begins for Wexford. Where are the two kids (Giles 15 and Sophie 13)?<br /><br />  Motives for their harm abound.  The scene becomes quite complex.<br />  Rendell is simply great with her series; her combination of strong central characters<br />(Wexford, his family, and Mike Burden, his assistant),  a riveting story line,  and the usual<br />outstanding interplay between the characters, the plot, and setting make \\"Babes in the Wood\\" a<br />comfortable companion to the others in this series.<br />  Her fans know that, barring some great literary upheaval, Wexford \\"will out.\\" The murder<br />will be solved--this is a given.  The author, like others in this genre, most notably P.D. James,<br />Martha Grimes, and Donna Leon, concentrates on the strength of her central character:  his<br />wisdom and savvy, his personal and internal struggles, his depth of perception, his abilities simly to<br />solve the case.  In addition, Rendell does not hesitate to foray into sensitive and socially significant<br />issues (spousal and child abuse, racism).  Each of her books is an adventure alone,  but as the series<br />progressed the complete picture of a complex and gentle man emerges.<br />  \\"Babes in the Wood\\" joints smartly in this stellar series.

For Donna Leon's fans, Venice, the Most Serene Republic, is anything but serene! In yet another, the seventh<br />sure-winner in her Commissario Guido Brunetti series, Leon once again masterminds a plot, setting, and unforgettable characters in a must-read book.<br /> In &quot;A Noble Radiance,&quot; Leon shows what a master she is in establishing a grappling narrative hook, an absorbing<br />plot filled with dangerous curves, pitfalls, and landmines, and a theme that at once is contemporary and yet for all<br />time. The novel begins with the discovery of a badly decomposed body in a lonely farmfield in the north of Italy, and,<br />as her previous novels have it, Brunetti is given the case.<br /> Just as he suspects, the body belongs to a kidnapped young man, the noble heir to a considerable estate. It is<br />Brunetti's responsibility to bring the news to the young man's family. Realist that he is, Brunetti is quick to find that,<br />indeed, something is rotten in the land of the nobili, and from this point on, the reader is led--even carried--to the<br />conclusion. The conclusion, however, appears a bit weak, albeit quite satisfying, I suppose, as Leon's endings usually<br />have a way of being far more thought- provoking.<br />Still, the book is well-worth the time spent--unfortunately, the time goes all too fast when reading Leon; one has the<br />tendency to wish they would keep on going, as they are, indeed, so mesmerizing. She has created such memorable<br />characters, most notably Brunetti, who has such a noble philosophy. It is almost as if he is a salmon without a stream,<br />as his ideals, his honesty, his concept of right and wrong seem at odds with today's sense of morality, whether it be<br />Italian politics or not. Leon's books are never ones to shy away from social issues and concerns and it is almost as if<br />she is Cassandra weeping outside the gates of Ilium, begging for anyone to believe her as she touches on responsible<br />concerns: the environment (especially), corruption (both political and social), and immorality in various forms.

To decipher would be the triumph of the time, or so one is told. It is written in such a secret code that, so far, the top cryptologists have been unable to get anywhere.<br />Alas, the first body is that of young Pamenes, who's found dead in his locked room and Telamon begins his work.  Of course, it is not long before other murders are committed, a plethora of \\"clues\\" is presented, and the solution seems impossible.<br /><br />Along the way, Doherty has treated us to a welcomed accounting of the men and the times, brutality and beauty alike.

Beginning with graphic scenes of the Russian Front in the dead of winter in l943, McCann then introduces us to young Rudi, a boy totally captivated and dedicated to dance.<br />The novel then takes off, ala a good foreign film, in several directions, shifting bluntly from one character to another, a carefully choreographed and orchestrated plot outline.  We watch with fascination as Rudi grows up, is given special attention by the state authorities, especially at the Kirov, and then successfully defects to the West.  The book is a miasma of successes and failures, a pot pourri of Nureyev's lifestyle and profession.  McCann portrays at once a young man given to his great ego and self confidence, his insensitivities to friends and associates alike, and his dedication to the few close friends (and family) he maintains.<br />This is a picture that perhaps not everyone is happy with; however, it's fiction and much of the speculation can be accepted. Even if &quot;Dancer&quot; was not so obviously about Nureyev, substituting a completely fictional name for the character would not diminish McCann power in this riviting book.  A good read.<br />(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2003-09-16

His Navajo Reservation gang is up to its elbows in trying to solve yet another homicide.  This time, it's a mysterious agent whose death extends clues in numerous directions, not the least to the very center of America itself, Washington D.C.<br />Hillerman's action takes place almost entirely off the Reservation.  The complicated web he has woven involves primarily the drug trade, massive fraud by oil and gas organizations, and the smuggling of illegal aliens across the Mexican border.  Hillerman has chosen to take his socially significant themes to a much broader horizon and readers may feel they're reading from a daily newspaper (lately described as \\"America's newest fiction form!\\") editorial page.  Still, the issues he present couldn't be more relevant.<br />Granted, he takes care of his established characters. The Legendary Joe Leaphorn contributes heavily and Jim Chee faces a complicated and complex set of personal struggles: his relationship with Bernie, his responsibility to his native culture, and his loyalty to his job.  Hillerman has no problem with any of this, yet \\"The Sinister Pig\\" seems to move at a pace unusually fast for the author.  This book seems to concentrate on action rather than devote much time to personal philosophy and Navajo culture.  Nonetheless, Hillerman has another winner.	2003-05-29

For  Candace Robb's legion of Owen Archer fans, \\"A Spy for the Redeemer\\" will hold no<br />surprises:  this seventh episode of her series featuring  Owen, the former soldier  and now<br />one-eyed spy for Archbishop Robert Thoresby of York,  finds himself embroiled in another<br />of his 14th century intrigues.  And, as with the other six, this one is absorbing and full of<br />interest-holding elements.<br />Once again, Owen is sent on an errand for his Archbishop, this time to Owen's home<br />country of Wales, where treason, murder, and more mayhem abound, and he is caught up<br />in the webs of deceit, Church intrigue, and local loyalties.  Indeed, Owen, for a while, is<br />tempted to stay and fight for his native lands, certainly a treasonous act there.<br />And back in York, Owen's wife Lucy, a local and successful apothecary, finds her own life<br />even more complicated.  Aside from missing her husband and trying to run her own<br />household, she finds she is the victim of some malicious gossip, gossip that questions her<br />own professional abilities, her husbands loyalty to the Crown, and her relationship with a<br />handsome and accommodating neighbor.  These ingredients make for a very complex and<br />complicated life for her.<br />Yet, with the usual Robb finesse, both Lucy and Owen are able to overcome their<br />difficulties, as one would imagine.  Overcoming their problems is never in doubt, of course,<br />but it is how they are overcome that provides the interest.  Robb's ability to create<br />characters that are believable and interesting keeps her stories alive.  \\"A Spy for the<br />Redeemer\\" will come as no surprise to readers already familiar with the series; for new<br />readers, this trip down history lane will be a pleasant experience...	2003-05-05

It's the eight episode for Candace Robb's quintessential medieval spy Owen Archer and<br />neither  the author nor the character seems to be slowing down.<br />Archer, the trusted one-eyed spy for the Archbishop of York, is once again thrust into the<br />maelstrom of deadly struggles between the Lancasters and the Church.  What is a spy,<br />married to York's only female apothecary, to do?<br />Whatever direction he choose, he's bound to find a puzzle.  For one, the Bishop of<br />Winchester has created a situation that could plunge the country into a civil war.  Through<br />the bishop's apparent bungling, a trusted friend to King Edward III and knight of the<br />realm has been captured by the French and before a ransom could be negotiated, he dies in<br />prison.  His widow, the Lady Pagnell, holds the bishop fully responsible and wishes to<br />extract her own pound of flesh (to borrow from Shakespeare some two hundred years<br />later).<br />While in York to try to smooth things over with the Pagnell family, the bishop finds his<br />own life in danger.  Coupled with what appears to be attempts to assassinate him, murder<br />is discovered when a fire goes up in flames, leaving the victim inside.  Thus, Owen Archer's<br />sleuthing skills are called in.  Owen's wife Lucy, the co-protagonists of Robb's series, has<br />recently had a miscarriage and her recovery, both mentally and physically, is taking its toll<br />on the Archer household.  The woman murdered had been responsible for helping Lucy in<br />her recovery and both Lucy and Owen feel driven to find her murderer.<br />And, of course, the hunt is afoot and with Robb's usual good skill, York is eventually given<br />the solution.  But before the murderer is revealed, Robb has a story to tell and, once again,<br />she does it with exciting readability.

In a lengthy (time-wise) story (it covers<br />the period of time from 1776 to 1839), Oblivions Altar is the story of a great<br />Cherokee chieftain named Kah-nung-da-tla-geh, the Man Who Walks the<br />Mountaintops, or Ridge.  He is a leader of his tribe who has vision far beyond his<br />own geographic limitations; he is a man who has determined, through his wisdom,<br />experience, and personal makeup, that his people can be delivered into new<br />freedoms, that they can co-exist with the white man, if given half a chance.  It is the<br />perfidy of man that seems destined to prevent his vision, his dreams.<br />Thus, it comes<br />as no surprise when treaties, agreements, and integrity fail to win the day.<br />Of course, try as hard as they may, justifying the complete subjugation of the native<br />Americans does not come across convincingly by any degree.  The arguments<br />presented by both historians and politicians always ring hollow, now decades and<br />decades later.  Greed, jealousy, hatred, yes, even religious convictions fueled this<br />hegemonious movement and America is not the better or more proud for it.  David Marion Wilkinsons book cedes that this is a given, at least by any intelligent reader.<br />It is the understanding of the nature of the beast that he seems to dwell upon.<br />Wilkinsons protagonists draw more than sympathy, of course.  With painstaking<br />detail, a thorough presentation, and depth of the entire picture of this<br />not-so-glorious picture in Americas past, the author makes a case that is difficult to<br />refute (most dont try to refute it today, of course).  But Wilkinsons novel is not a<br />soap box oratory on the evils of Manifest Destiny, or even the evils of the white man.<br />This would be too obvious and he transcends the glaring obvious and instead<br />presents a remarkable story, a genuine story of an American tragic hero and as a<br />tragic hero, Ridge has his tragic flaw.  Is it naivet&eacute;?  A foolhardy trust of his fellow<br />human beings that brings bout his own demise, as Shakespeare might say?<br />Regardless, Kah-nung-da-tla-geh, the Man Who Walks the Mountaintops, comes<br />across not so much as the martyr for his cause, but as a genuine, sensitive human<br />being, a man with broad shoulders and even broader horizons.<br />The  Trail of Tears and the other degrading examples of justice serve as a<br />convincing backdrop to the entire picture.<br /> But when Ridge sings his own epitaph:<br />(Worry not for the Man Who Walks the Mountaintops, my friends.  For I am old,<br />my children are grown, and I am truly weary of the cares of this world.  My<br />ancestors are waiting for me. I will know what its like to be loved by my people<br />again. Im not afraid to die.), we are convinced of his own immortality, and more<br />importantly the essence of his immortality.<br />Wilkinsons style of writing is easy-paced, but the depth and understanding in this<br />pace is remarkable and add to the quality of his prose.  Certainly, he seems to<br />possess more than a passing knowledge of the landscape and atmosphere he creates.<br />This author comes across as knowing what he writes about and does so in a<br />convincing manner.

Simon Hawke has posted his third episode in his William Shakespeare-Tuck Smythe medieval mystery series.  As with the previous two, \\"Much Ado About Murder\\" is a fun read, a<br />story of derring-do, intrigue, comedy, romance, and did we mention murder?<br /> Hawke's chief protagonist is, you guessed it, THE William Shakepeare. Much has been written about the Bard, but no one has made him out to be an Elizabethan solver of murders<br />and Hawke deserves the praise.<br /> While not a heavy weight in the PD James or Ruth Rendell mysteries, nevertheless  this series is well worth the time spent.  And one does not need to be a Shakespearean authority to<br />enjoy the mystery.  True, Hawke laces his prose with often clever references to the original Shakespeare, tossing in a lines here and there that, of course, \\"found\\" their way into one or more of the original plays.<br /> In this series, Shakespeare has not yet completed one play, although he has now discovered he can at least pay the bills by writing sonnets on commision.  Young twenty-ish<br />Will works as a minor actor for the Queen's Men, who, because of a current plague, are out of work and are only just managing to make ends meet.  Shakespeare's friend Symington Smythe<br />II (Tuck) and he become involved when a friend (of a friend) is arrested for murder.  The hunt is on, as this daring duo are convinced that the arrested man is innocent.<br /> But the play's the thing, wherein they're bound to catch the conscience of the thing, and through diligence, brilliance, and cleverness, well, all's well that end's well, to coin a<br />phrase.<br /> Indeed, \\"Much Ado About Murder\\" is a delightful book, whether one is versed in Shakespeare or not.

Once again, Westfield's Men find themselves facing the usual plethora of problems, some theatrical, some personal, some criminal (that is to say,<br />\\"murderous\\").  Once again, it appears that this illustrious and dynamic theatrical troupe will face its final curtain!<br />In \\"The Bawdy Basket,\\" young actor Frank Quilter's father has just been executed at Smithfield.  Believing him to have been<br />innocently condemned, Frank sets out to right the wrong and to return honor and dignity to his family name.  He enlists his friend Nick Bracewell to help him.  Of course, clearing this case is not so simple, as the pathways to righteousness are<br />indeed anything but straight and narrow. Winding through the alleys and byways of London, the duo run into all kinds of obstacles.<br /> In addition, Edmund Hoode, the company's irreplaceable playwright, has fallen in love once again and is determined to leave the theater, much to the consternation of the rest.  That problem has to be be solved.<br /> And Marston does solve all the problems, of course.  Despite his usual stilted dialogue, the book runs true to course.  \\"The Bawdy Basket\\" further illustrates the<br />conditions and situations of Elizabethan England and for students of medieval history (and who love historical myteries), this episode deserves a standing ovation.	2003-02-10

Tragedy is not quite the same.  Brendan DuBois enters into the world of<br />international conspiracies with \\"Richard's Children\\" and leaves the reader with more than just<br />\\"food for thought.\\"<br /> P.C. Doherty, to list another story, makes a most readable \\"mystery\\" out of Shakespeare's<br />own death, employing a few tricks in the writing trade to provide insight into an author's life (and<br />death) that we really know very little about.<br /> And so it goes, a variety into the spice of Shakespeare's tales, with other stories by such<br />notables as Peter Tremayne, Margaret Frazer, Jeffrey Deaver, Sharon Newman, and Simon Brett,<br />to name a few.<br /> Clever, delightful, skillful, readable.

Taking all the known facts, they begin to splice,<br />glue, cut, and paste the parts extraordinaire into a viable, working case.  The girl, Nell Ryder, was<br />abducted, along with a famous race horse she was attending.  No clues and no ransom note either.<br />The scenario is  intrigue for his soul (and mind) and Jury, with his Dr. Watson (Melrose)  wanders<br />into the  very lucrative business of horse racing and breeding.  He is mesmerized by the personality<br />of Nell, who was described by one of the trainers as \\"a filly dressed up in a girl costume,\\" so<br />complete was her love for horses.  As the local police have virtually given up on the case (after all,<br />there were no active clues for past two years!), it appears that the effort would be futile; yet, as Jury<br />acknowledges, there are a few elements that don't add up.<br /><br /> And, of course, Grimes, through the efforts of Jury, Plant, et al., races on, heading for the<br />final furlong and then, finally, at  breakneck speed.

From its opening pages, Corpse Candle holds the readers<br />attention and the plot unfolds in a timely manner and pace.  Few loose ends are left<br />and the conclusion logical and noteworthy.

It is intellectually refreshing to read accounts of war by an author who actually<br />knows what he's talking about.  In \\"Afghanistan: A Russian Soldier's Story,\\" the<br />author is Vladislav Tamarov, who, at the age of 19, was sent as a young recruit of<br />the Russian army to fight in Afghanistan.  This book is a reflection and a<br />commentary on that war, a war which not only changed him but had definite<br />political effects on his entire nation.<br />  But this book is not meant to be viewed as a scholarly tome on the philosophy of<br />wars; instead, it is one young man's personal treatise on \\"what it was like&quot; to be<br />mounting a military mission on foreign soil, a mission that, for his nation, turned<br />out to be quite a failure.  What the ingredients were of that failure are still being<br />debated internationally, but the personal musings on this young man are far from<br />clinical in its citings.  Tamarov transcends the clinical and presents a startling and<br />poignant perspective on the entire project.  It's almost as if Audie Murphy had<br />written (and photographed) his own days in World War II, it is that gripping.<br />  \\"Afghanistan: A Russian Soldier's Story\\" personalizes these young soldiers (often<br />illustrated by the author's own photography). It is, as Faulkner would say, \\"full of<br />sound and fury.\\" Alas, it signifies something, however, to extend the Faulknerian<br />metaphor, and that something is a combination of pathos, incredulity, shock,<br />amazement--the whole gamut of startling and revealing emotions.  Tamarov's story<br />reveals the fears, the lack of comprehension of such a mission, the relationships among his fellow soldiers, the consternation he<br />feels toward the whole picture of this Soviet move into Afghanistan.  As a young<br />soldier, Tamarov was not privy to the higher political, social, economic, and<br />religious aspects of his country's undertaking, of course, as few citizens really are.<br />However, Tamarov was astute enough to keep a private diary and to have a camera<br />at the ready and when the time came, his views on the whole affair have been<br />revealed.  He, of course, is not alone in these feelings, and his book seems to speak<br />for Everyman.  War is not good, it's not kind, and its aftermath is oftentimes<br />beyond redemption.  But \\"That is war,\\" he writes. \\"We didn't invent it but having<br />been in a war we understand the meaning of the word.\\" And amongst the pages of<br />this compelling read, Tamarov presents a definition that is at once disturbing and<br />yet so to the point.  War is hell and he shows us circles that even Dante didn't<br />consider!<br />  \\"Afghanistan:  A Russian Soldier's Story\\" is a must read for hawks and doves<br />alike.  And while no new theories are advanced (and the author doesn't pretend to<br />offer any), this depiction of one of civilization's evils is worth the read.

Doherty, or Paul Harding, or Michael Clynes, or Anna Apostolou, etc., take your pick) usually writes of medieval England. His Brother Athelstan series, his Sir Roger Shallot series, his Canterbury Tales series, and his Hugh Corbett series are all riveting accounts of Merry Olde told with great interest and authority on the time and place.  Doherty, certainly a learned man in his own \\"write,\\" is well documented.  His Egyptian series and now his Alexander the Great works probably only show how erudite he is!<br />\\"The Godless Man,\\" the second of the Alexander the Great tomes, seems to lack not only the enthusiasm but the documentation Doherty usually provides to become really thorough.  Granted, this is a work of fiction and authors do not have to be historically accurate or even convincing, for, after all, it's the storyline that primarily counts, not incidental elements.<br />Taking on Alexander the Great is a more daunting task that concentrating on one of Chaucer's pilgrims! Of course, \\"The Godless Man\\" is not really about Alexander; instead, it is the story of Telamon, who is The Great's physician. Assisted ably by Cassandra, Telemon must solve the puzzle of a mass murder in the Temple of Hercules in the newly occupied city of Ephesus.  And such a quandry, as the denizens of that capital city are not too keen to help the occupying force, concerned with their own immediate problems.  They've seen occupying armies come and go and they suspect that the Macedonians won't hang around either!<br />But Alexander is insistent that these murders (and subsequent ones to keep the plot suspenseful) be solved, for it reflects directly upon him and his abilities to occupy a conquered city.<br />Telamon, a childhood friend of Alex's, rises to the occasion and some 300 pages later succeeds.<br />Doherty seems intent, himself, upon a conquering of sorts--to conquer the world of historical fiction.  And may he succeed, as he's a delightful writer to read.  However, veering away from England seems to lose something in its translations.  This book is worth the read, but arguably he should concentrate on his own native shores, or else go beyond what he has presented and work for a more mesmerizing plot. He seems to spend too much time trying to justify what he's doing in time frame in the first place. The subtitle of the book is \\"A Mystery of Alexander the Great\\" and is a bit misleading.  Probably few historical figures are more interesting than Alexander and Doherty gives little insight (other than to proclaim emphatically that he and Hephaestion were NOT lovers!)into one of the greatest generals of all time. Fans of Doherty (and I am one) won't flee the gates, however.  Doherty deserves his praise!wever, veering away from England seems to lose something in its translations.

In Bernard Cornwell's \\"Gallows Thief\\" the author changes gears abit (as well as genres) and give us a historical mystery procedural that  is worthy of its classification. ... Set  in Regency England, the book introduces us to Sandman, a hero of the Battle of Waterloo, who returns home to find his father's lost the family fortune (and committed suicide) and accompanying social standing. Rider is unemployed and, having previously sold his commission,is without a penny.  His fiancee has canceled their wedding plans and he finds himself housed in a Drury Lane hotel of dire repute, or \\"flash house.\\"<br />But all is not lost.  His skills as a cricket player, plus his ties with friends in high places, count for something, so it's not as if he has to sell himself on the streets.  Well, almost, anyway.  He is recommended to the Home Secretary to look into a petition from the mother of a young man who's been found guilty of murder and is only days from being hanged.  His job is to ascertain that justice has been served and then the sentence can be carried out.  Sandman takes the employment and, being the honest and justice-minded soul he is, soon begins having doubts as to the young man's guilt.  Slowly, he enlists an intrepid band of partners and they progress through the case: Berrigan, a former sergeant also of the Waterloo campaign;  his friend Lord Alexander; Miss Sally Hood, an actress and model; and Eleanor, the aforementioned  former fiancee.  However, as they have only seven days to find \\"cause\\" to overturn the conviction, they have to work with full speed ahead.<br />Along the way, Cornwell's consummate research/background material support the general plot outline in typical Coarnwellian fashion.  The author does not hesitate to dwell upon the abject social situations abounding in early 19th century England, from the court and prison systems to the religious areas.  The social significance that he addresses does not go amiss, especially the zeal for the courts to hang as many as they can, ostensibly to deter crime.  Sandman and other free thinkers have difficulty accepting this concept. \\"They don't hang as many in Scotland as we do in England and Wales.  Yet, I believe the murder rate is no higher.Strange, wouldn't you say?\\" asks one of the characters.<br />But the strength of \\"Gallows Thief\\" is in the presentation of Rider Sandman, a good, healthy, lively man who is not content to tolerate these unacceptable conditions of the human spirit, naive man that he sometimes is.  He has a good heart (even though he thinks it's broken!).<br />The book progresses well, for the most part, and it certainly leads one to believe that, surely, this is the first of a long series.  History it is, but with a twist; it's England, warts and all.  A good read. ...o hang as many as they can, ostensibly to deter crime.

It's a lot of fun to see debonair and sophisticated William Buckley drop his erudite (often pedantic) airs and just write for the fun of it (or as one fan noted, \\"so the rest of us can understand what he's saying!\\").  In \\"Elvis in the Morning,\\" Buckley, the noted politico pundit, takes an unlikely subject (for him) and develops/presents it in a fascinating, readable, and enjoyable manner.<br />To say his prose moves rapidly is an understatement, as this clever--yet in places ever so poignant--novel moves with a real rock 'n roll upbeat, although hardly taking time for the traditional chorus rounds! Orson Killere is the young son of a German mother who works for the US Army in Wiesbaden.  A devout Presley fan, he gets caught stealing Elvis records at the local PX.  Elvis, stationed nearby, hears about it and arranges for a meeting. They become lifelong friends and confidents.<br />This is not the story of Elvis, but of Orson, or \\"Killer,\\" as Elvis playfully calls him.  Elvis, of course, is the pivotal point of the book, as like a proper musical recitative (or even leitmotiv), we keep coming back to him, continually until the King's death.  This relationship between the two--often symbiotic, often close--make a fascinating story, whether one is an Elvis fan or not.<br />While this is a work of fiction, Buckley exercises literary license here and there, but his research is thorough and can't be faulted (after all, remember, this is fiction).  His ability to capture the landscape and atmosphere is unquestioned and Buckley shows once again that reading (and in his case,writing) is also a fun undertaking.  \\"Elvis in the Morning\\" is an odyssey or sorts and that said, don't expect to find the proverbial Trojan horse; just think of Orson as Cassandra, knowing what lies ahead but powerless to stop the inevitable.

William Buckley has made his living with words (is there anyone alive with a greater vocabulary?).  Some of his scholarly works are, indeed, scholarly and rest on their own merits.<br />With his fiction, however, he takes the famous Buckley I'm-an-Ivy-Leaguer-and-you-are-not approach.  Even his Blackie Oakes adventures have that tongue-in-cheek appearance. It's almost as if he condescends to the rest of us mortals when he publishes his fiction.<br />That said, however, it is rather difficult to dismiss his attempts at \\"common fiction\\" in \\"Nuremberg:  A Reckoning.\\"  Told, basically, from the point of view of Sebastian Rheinhardt, whom we meet as a 13-year-old in l939 about to be spirited away to the safety of America in a time when critical signs were showing the imminent Nazi stranglehold on Europe, the book looks at the war from different perspectives, least of all a German-emigre part Jewish.  Sebastian and his mother are permitted to leave The Fatherland, but his father is not.  What happens from this point on is a critical issue in the plot development.  \\"Nuremberg: A Reckoning\\" perhaps should read \\"the Reckonings,\\" as Buckley uses wide-vision here.<br />Taking this setting--and particularly the Nuremberg trials--is a daunting task; indeed, not one to be taken lightly.  And Buckley doesn't take it lightly. Knowing full well that Nuremburg (and the Nazis) have been written by so many and in so many ways, Buckley sets about to present his take on this entire picture.  It's his personal spin on the subject and via the fiction genre.<br />His scholarly background shows through in the sensitivities he portrays, in the description of the landscape (such as it is in 1945) and atmosphere in the immediate aftermaths of the war.  And he certainly reflects what Nuremberg was like in l945 and of the frustration of the entire trial.  Buckley in his inimical style is at times bitchy and poignant.  Never one to suffer fools lightly, he doesn't here, feeding us tidbits of titillating information about various judges trying the case.  Too, it's clear that his personal animosity towards things Soviet shows up here, but perhaps justifiably so, as history seems to have revealed.<br />Young Sebastian, however, finds himself in the sort of dilemma that Stephan Crane presented in \\"Red Badge of Courage,\\" although Sebby is not in a conflict within himself over his courage.  One can see the reflection of Buckley in Sebastian (examples of sharp wit and energetic thought processes), yet the narrative and plot development don't become author self-centered.  Buckley's attitude is that you can accept or not, but the story's still there. C'est tout, c'est fini.<br />Buckley's \\"take\\" on various segments of our society (his society) is more than just \\"interesting\\" (his \\"Elvis in the Morning\\" illustrates this perfectly!). Buckley seems to feel that he has a right (and he does) to make commentary (fictional or otherwise) on any subject.  His talents are well known.<br />In \\"Nuremberg\\" he spares us from much of the customary horrors of any work relating to the Holocaust, as terrifying and unacceptable as it was. Still, that said, this work holds up well and to those  who really know Nuremberg in the post war years, he's done a credible job. ...ting information about various judges trying the case.

In addition to reporting the scene, of course, she makes some procedural mistakes and Hillerman is off and running. Besides Officer Manuelito taking a larger role in Hillerman's works, the fusion and relationship between Leaphorn and Chee is never better and the chemistry continues to work well.  Chee's young--and sometimes hasty--ways are always tempered by Leaphorn's experience and older judgment.  What a team!<br />Hillerman's revelations and plot summations are not always so complicated and involved, as in this case, but his devotion to great character development, presentation of landscape, atmosphere, native American culture and history, and sound logic in thought and deed make \\"The Wailing Wind\\" one of his best works. This is a relief, of course, to his readers, who are always one breath away of thinking that the last one's the last one!  So far so good.<br />In \\"The Wailing Wind,\\" murder, greed, jealousy, and a bit of madness play into the darker side of the book's development.  Fortunately, Hillerman is sound in his delivery of good and just practices and human beings. Here, while the book may not leave the reader mesmerized from page to page to the extent you can't put it down, the author takes control of all developments and his pacing and nuance never let the story get away from him.<br />Perhaps more than anything, his works are about relationships rather than \\"who done it.\\"  Either way, Hillerman's a man/author of the Southwest whose appeal seems universal.  \\"The Wailing Wind\\" is worth the time and effort. In fact, it's a pleasure.<br />...o done it.\\"  Either way, Hillerman's a man/author of the Southwest whose appeal seems universal.  \\"The Wailing Wind\\" is worth the time and effort.

Indeed, as the liner jacket notes and other reviewers have readily stated, Daniel<br />Silva and \\"The English Assassin\\" are \\"in the style of Robert Ludlum.\\" Whether that's<br />hailed as a compliment or not, of course, remains to be seen.<br />First, indeed, \\"The English<br />Assassin\\" is \\"shades of Ludlum.\\" It is fast paced (faster than much of Ludlum's last<br />novels), involves an international James Bond-like special governmental agent (this time,<br />an Israeli agent ... art restorer), and is all awash in a grander than life consipiracy<br />(did anyone mention Robert Ludlum!!!) in which, like the definition of a grand epic hero,<br />the whole world depends upon his--and his alone--actions to rid us of such Evil. (In this<br />case, it's the Swiss cover-up, involvement, and dishonesty, with their complicity with the<br />Nazis during World War II.).<br />Ludlum it is, and Ludlum it is not. For one, the plot line is<br />greatly reminiscent of Ludlum; for two, however, Silva is Ludlum without the long (and<br />now boring) sermons on left-wing conspiracies to take over the civilized world.

Certainly Ruth Rendell is ONE of the best writers around today, with  wide-stretching parameters with character, plot development, intrigue, even brilliance.  With \\"Adam and Eve and Pinch Me\\" she stays true to form--typically Rendellian in the sheer presentation of a psycho-drama.<br />Generally, she's shied away from \\"ghost writing,\\" but this time she marches on stage with a psycho thriller that is almost impossible to put down. Ms Rendell is a master at this, as readers well know. She's able to take the commonplace and transcend these elements into something Beyond.<br />Her ability to capture completely the attention of her readers here is top form.  However, it's not the type (nor ending!) that makes the reader cry for \\"more,\\" but perhaps more like \\"uncle\\"!  She's brilliant in this genre (her Inspector Wexford series is no slack either, by the way, but light years away in format and drama)....	2002-03-05

Reginald Hill can be quite clever at times; he is usually quite good at times, and in his latest, he's both. Hill has long held a fascination with words and word play and this one tops them all.<br />It's not Plato's Dialogues and it's not Shakespeare--both had a way with words, to be sure, but Hill's \\"Dialogues\\" pursues a different spin from other police procedurals and he actually seems to want the alert reader to get involved, the boorish, crude Dalziel aside!<br /> It's not so \\"literary\\" or \\"cerebral\\" that the words get in the way, but when the Wordman starts wreaking havoc (in the form of murder and meyhem), this erstwhile duo of D&P go to work.  Hill keeps up with his \\"dips\\" into the psyches of both Dalziel and Pascoe and that helps keep this exciting series running.<br />There are no surprises with this author's talent and ability--he's one of the tops around. (He's not above throwing in a different spin for an ending, however, as he's done, say, with \\"Pictures of Perfection.\\")<br /> This episode, however,  will keep you in its grasp long after the final word is read! It may not be his best and it's certainly not my favorite (\\"Child's Play\\" and \\"Exit Lines\\" are my two favorites--I haven't been inclined to think about which is his best--readers oftentimes get the two mixed up!), but it's a Hill worth struggle for!....	2002-03-05

In Marc Dugain's first<br />novel \\"The Officers' Ward,\\" the French-born author has furnished yet another story (and<br />lesson) from the \\"War to end all Wars.\\"<br /> To say it was \\"the worst of times\\" would be an understatement and young<br />Lieutenant Adrien Fournier finds himself an early casualty of the German onslaught.  He's<br />devastatingly wounded--much of his face is blown away--and he's transported to Paris to<br />await recovery and rehabilation for the rest of the war, some five years or so.  A bright<br />young man (an engineer by education), and handsome, he must now face a future<br />grotesquely disfigured and to a whole where self pity, even repulsion, await him.  He<br />forms a long-standing bond with three others who've suffered similar injuries. It is a time<br />for them all to come to grips with their own mortality.<br /> But Fournier is no lightweight and sets about facing his own destiny.  His time in<br />hospital--in a special ward for soldiers with such facial injuries--serves as the basis of his<br />own positive perception of the world to come.  It's not an easy ride for him.<br /> The general idea for this story comes from Dugain's own grandfather, himself a<br />veteran of The Great War.  \\"The Officers' Ward\\" was honored with France's Prix des<br />Libraires, and was  on the short-list for the Grand Prix of the Acad&eacute;mie Française.<br />Dugain's power of description and episode is a depressingly tragic view of such a<br />senseless war, yet these tragic elements are somehow overshadowed by the hope and the<br />will of the human spirit to rise above the personal pitfalls and to function positively within<br />the confines of a civilized society. But most importantly it is within the confines of his own<br />self-image that Lieutenant Fournier prevails.  Dugain deserves his accolades.<br />(...)	2002-03-01

An imminent Texas book critic has called M.C. Beaton the \\"Barbara Cartland\\" of police procedurals, if not in quantity in formula!  That said, of course, readers of Beaton's Hamish Macbeth series will once again welcome her newest addition, \\"Death of a Celebrity,\\" the 18th episode about her affable and honest constable from the<br />affable yet murderous village of Lochdubh somewhere in the Scottish Highlands.<br />To call \\"Death of a Celebrity\\" a \\"Scottish fling\\" would be a bad pun, but still.  Once again, an outsider has come to the fair village, this time in the role of an irritating local television host who revels in making people miserable. Insufferable herself, TV \\"star\\" Crystal French sets about offending yea and nay, giving just about everyone but the Archbishop in Edinburgh a motive for killing her.  In true Beaton style (and by page 30), we have our corpse.<br />Enter our Hamish, still a-fretting about his long lost love Priscilla Halburton-Smythe who's just announced her impending marriage to another, who quickly lines up \\"all the usual suspects.\\" Thus,  Beaton treats us to another littany of local characters, many of whom we've met in previous episodes (after all Lochdubh is a small village!).<br />Thus, working alone, working with a new boss, and working with a new romantic interest, Macbeth bounces here and there and eventually it is his insight, his perseverance, his knowledge of human nature that lead him, inevitably, to the solution<br />No surprises here, of course, and perhaps the Beaton followers (and I'm one of them) don't want or expect anything else.  A P.D. James or Ruth Rendell she is not; but her fans don't confuse her with those two.  They love her as she is.<br />If you want predictability and you do not wish to have to think about solving the case, any and all of the Hamish Macbeth books are for you.  They're fun to read.	2002-02-05

Hillerman takes a real-life crime (In 1998 three \\"survivalists\\" steal a truck,<br />murder a policeman, and then disappear.

However, as we well know, this was no mirage and eventually the Nazis were goose-stepping their way down the boulevards of The City of Light.<br />Thus, with this somber--and agreeably frightening--spirit enveloping the continent, Alan Furst's \\"Kingdom of Shadows\\" mesmerizes its readers and we wait for the action to play out.  Of course, we know the historical outcome, but Furst is able to paint an atmosphere that is both real and surreal. The Nazis are coming, the Nazis are coming!<br />  Furst's central character forty-ish Nicholas Morath loves Paris, where he's been living for some time now as a (not \\"an\\") Hungarian expatriot (which translates, in those days, as an aristocrat!).  Indeed, a bon vivant in his own right, Nicholas' life even borders on the boring, despite the prestigious life style he enjoys--his uncle is a count; he moves in and out of Parisian high life with the greatest of ease.<br />  But he's not French. He's Hungarian and the winds of war certainly are undeniable.  He also is privy to the covert Nazi political machinations and, like Cassandra, knows the future only too well.  Thus, he is enlisted by his uncle to \\"help the cause\\" and he goes about with the energy of a true patriot.Furst treats us to a geography lesson as well,as Nicholas hops, skips, and jumps his way across the path of the German war machine, from Paris to Budapest to Bratislava to Antwerp,and so on in a gallant effort to save his own country.<br />  The atmosphere Furst creates works well with the geography of the land, the political climate of the time, and the naivete of much of the \\"modern world.\\"  This is not to say that \\"Kingdom of Shadows\\" is dull reading--far from it.  The author has no difficulty in catching--and holding--the reader's undivided attention.  His dramatic pacing, his power of description and episode--all blend into an excellent read, one that, due to its historical implications, certainly cannot contain a \\"and they lived happily ever after\\" ending.  We know what Hitler did in l939 and that he continued in like manner for a few more years.  Furst doesn't take us past 1939. Yet, we know, of course.<br />This is an excellent read--not just for students of history, but for anyone who delights in being caught up in a plausible--yet exciting--storyline.e that, due to its historical implications, certainly cannot contain a \\"and they lived happily ever after\\" ending.

And when he writes about the<br />Arthurian Tales, what can one say?  Intertwining his sense of mysticism, his intellectual scope, and a<br />fast-paced, very moving, novel in one is a bit much to hope for!  But in &#8220;The Return of Merlin,&#8221;<br />Chopra has accomplished this feat.  Not an &#8220;easy read&#8221; generally, Chopra&#8217;s magical touch with the<br />printed word maintains his reputation in this tale from Arthur.<br /> In his introduction, Chopra writes that &#8220;The Return of Merlin&#8221; is about waking up the<br />wizard that sleeps within all of us, so that we can reclaim the field of pure knowledge and dream<br />anew world into reality, from the purity of our hearts.&#8221;<br /> &#8220;Merlin&#8221; is another odyssey of life, a story of the traditional good vs. evil and the struggles<br />therein. It is a story that erases the confines of time.  &#8220;To be alive now,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;is to be dead to<br />the past.  To be alive now is to have life-centered, present-moment awareness...(and) you will discover the dance of the divine in every leaf, in every petal...in every rainbow...in every breath of every living being.&#8221;  A momumental undertaking, to be sure.<br /> Taking the Arthurian characters, from Merlin to Arthur to Mordred with a cast of many<br />others, and mixing in a complete disregard for any logical historical time frame, Chopra explores<br />this struggle, this &#8220;to be or not to be&#8221; of Camelot.  Despite its frenzy, its whirlwind of action and<br />activity, &#8220;The Return of Merlin&#8221; is at once captivating, suspenseful, mesmerizing, combining<br />elements of  spectacular hope and goodness  and the depravitiy--nay, the power-- of penultimate<br />evil, Chopra shatters the pastoral hillsides of our psyche with this very-readable narrative.<br />Scholarly--yet quite readable!, the book is a page-turner.

Alas, his work following these two leaders of the genre<br />have not quite lived up to the reputations those exacted, but perhaps that&#8217;s not a fair evaluation.<br />Even Shakespeare had a few &#8220;off&#8221; works!<br /> In &#8220;The Veteran,&#8221; Forsyth offers us a collection of five short stories (or &#8220;novellas&#8221;).  His<br />terse, fast-paced, omniscient author style of writing is clearly demonstrated once more and, devoted<br />fan or not, readers should find this work worthwhile.  Borrowing a wee tad from O. Henry in &#8220;The<br />Veteran&#8221; (the first of the stories), Forsyth employs that ironic twist O. Henry perfected, as he shows<br />us a new &#8220;twist on justice.&#8221;  An unidentified older man is viciously beaten to death and two young<br />punks are arrested for the murder.  The surprise ending makes a disturbing story (and series of<br />events) end of a satisfactory note.<br /> In &#8220;The Art of the Matter,&#8221; the author takes us inside the machinations of a prestigious<br />London art auction house, which we watch unravel into helplessness.  Again, the O. Henry influence,<br />and so on, through the final set.  Forsyth shows the influence of Mark Twain, to lean on another<br />Ameican writer, with  his power of description of landscape and episode and not just a little wry<br />humor.  (Or in the case of &#8220;Matter&#8221;--&#8220;rye&#8221; humor!)<br /> All the stories are worth a read, as the author gives us a good glimpse into the human<br />character and  some excellent lessons in the humanities and in history, although short stories, it seems to me, are not his forte.

Naturally (and would we expect otherwise?), this one is a<br />long-lost Watson recollection, but no matter.<br /><br />Kendrick's story is quickly afoot and the pace never slows down.

Without a doubt, \\"Friends in High Places\\" is Donna Leon's best book in her mesmerizing Commissario Brunetti series. \\"Friends\\" is the ninth in this outstanding series and Leon has not failed her fans with this latest edition, which, for some unfathomable reason, is not yet published in the States!<br />The author is able to capture what very few writers in the mystery genre do-- she creates such memorable characters that the reader actually feels he really knows--and even possibly understands--her creations. Certainly, Leon does to Venice what few other writers do to their settings. It is unbelievable that she is able to understand fully the mechanizations of the modern Venetian. She has weaved her plots so intricately--and plausibly--in her series, which seems short of a miracle for some \\"outsider\\"--she's an American!--to be able to grasp the bureaucracies of that system, be it religious, political, social, even the illicit \\"trade\\" bureaucracies.<br />With her unforgettable Brunetti and his family, Leon's themes run throughout her novels: among them the \\"moral path\\" which is at odds with what Venetians have come to expect and to accept, it seems. If one has a problem, the solution is to utilize his \\"friends in high places\\"--a favor for a favor--to solve it. The corruption seems to permeate all aspects of their lives.<br />But, of course, first, this is a murder mystery, and here, again, Leon is in top form. How exquisitely she leads the reader through this valley of temptation and evil! Yet, despite the impossible task of ever \\"cleaning up Venice,\\" Brunetti plods on. He alone, it seems at times, knows right from wrong. He takes refuge and solace from his wife Paola; he loves his two children, and his greatest fear is that something evil might harm them.<br />He senses something is very wrong when a local bureaucrat is found dead; it is labeled an accident, but Brunetti has his suspicions, especially after this bureaucrat had previously contacted him to tell him that he had vital information that he must reveal to him, and to him alone. Before this revelation can occur, he is found dead. Brunetti doesn't believe in coincidences, especially when an attorney who is involved in a corruption investigation is found murdered by a sniper--an attorney whose telephone number Brunetti had found in the bureaucrat's wallet.<br />From this point on, Leon and Brunetti move cautiously--and sensibly--through this tangled, deceitful web.<br />The author is quite astute in her observations and realist she is, the endings of her books are not always the \\"happy ever after\\" type. Frequently, Brunetti has to con- cede to powers greater than his; he alone cannot stem the flow of corruption--and the Brunetti world, as seen through the series, seems to have no boundaries on corruption, be it from illegal dumping of toxic wastes to the illegal sex trade with local travel companies to the smuggling of drugs from Eastern Europe. Leon leaves no holds barred and the reader is often left to wonder if there really are truly decent folk anymore. Leon does not imply that the corruption is only in Venice, that Pearl of the Adriatic, but leads us to assume that such corruption--especially with today's big bucks, can be anywhere. The average reader knows this all too well, anyway.<br />For Leon fans, reading this book is not just an inclination, it is a must, naturally;<br />for new readers, it's also a great read, after reading this one, they will want to go back to the eight previous ones.

Stuart Kaminsky's Inspector Rostnikov series is firmly<br />settled in my list of favorite--and best--police procedural<br />mysteries.<br />Along with Donna Leon, Ruth Rendell, Martha Grimes, and P.D.<br />James, readers, who prefer this genre, cannot go wrong.<br />In his latest thriller, Kaminsky's intrepid inspector finds himself almost on a wild-Russian-goose chase, clear across the<br />Siberian tundra!  In \\"Murder on the Trans-Siberian Express,\\" the author winsomely blends his usual reader-intrigue with a trip into history to provide the reader with a salient, viable parallel of Rostnikov's pursuit.<br />As his readers of this series have come to expect, Kaminsky is not content to have one plot (certainly not, when three or four others simultaneously will do!)carry the book.  Rostnikov of the Moscow Metropolitan Police finds himself,once more, amid the political intrigue of Moscow while trying to sort out--and prosecute--labeled criminals!  With his amiable assistants,<br />Russian criminals are far from safe.  Karpov (\\"The Vampire\\") and Zelach are trying to find the kidnapped son of a local magnate.<br />The son is a disfranchised but popular local rock star known as the Cossack.  Elena and Iosef (Rostnikov's son) are pursuing a serial murderer in the Moscow subway system); and Sasha Tkach, aside from trying to solve his own marital problems, is working with Rostnikov on the primary case here!  A bit much?<br />A bit much? Confusing, perhaps? Not to this reader, who delights in Kaminsky's terse style, fantastic characterizations, incredible depth of perception of the Russia of today.<br />To say this book moves with the pace of a speeding freight train might strain the metaphor here, but regardless, Kaminsky maintains his control over the series (of which, one hopes, there will be many, many more episodes).  An excellent read--hop on board and get set for a delightful journey!  ...	2001-11-17

Richard Jury, the mainstay<br />character of Martha Grimes' immensely successful British police procedural series (the titles are all<br />names of actual pubs) centralizes the action in her latest, \\"The Blue Last,\\" in what will surely<br />quieten critics of her last Jury (\\"The Lamorna Wink\\") as having too little Jury (he'd been sent to<br />North Ireland for investigations and other characters conducted this investigation!).<br /> No matter. Grimes produces one of her best with \\"The Blue Last\\"!<br /> In 1939, during a bombing blitz by the Germans, the Blue Last, a pub owned by the<br />Tynedale Brewing Company, is destroyed and in it, the daughter of the Tynedale family.  By sheer<br />luck (coincidence?), the family nanny had only moments before taken the daughter's baby girl,<br />Maisie, out of the pub for some fresh air, leaving her own baby, of the same age, in the pub, and thus<br />to her own doom as well.  Enter DCI Mickey Haggarty of the London police, who, almost 60 years<br />later, has reason to suspect that, actually, the babies' identities had been switched and the heiress to<br />the Tynedale fortune is actually the nanny's own daughter!  Haggarty calls in his longtime friend<br />Jury to assist.  Judy is skeptical.  However, Haggarty reveals that he is dying of terminal cancer,<br />with only a few weeks to live and Jury cannot refuse.<br /> However, enter Murder One, in Haggarty's own patch, yet, coincidentally, the victim,<br />Simon Croft,  is a close friend of the Tynedale family, who's been writing a book of the London war<br />years.  The book has disappeared.  Was it because he was about to expose a scandal in the Tynedale<br />family as well?  Thus, now the two cases are inextricably intertwined.  And with these basic<br />premises, Grimes is off for the chase.<br /> And \\"The Blue Last\\" is vintage Grimes.  Jury is clearly in command of the investigation<br />and of the book and Grimes seems comfortable in letting Scotland Yard take charge.  But the book is not simply about investigating a murder.  All the Long Pidd characters come forging to the front,<br />too, as Grimes delights in \\"shaking them from the branches.\\"  It's Christmas, with its collateral<br />imagary, atmosphere, and tone, which the reader readily picks up.  Grimes takes a detour for a<br />couple of chapters as she stops the Jury deliberation of his own investigation to permit Melrose Plant<br />and Marshall Trueblook to make a quick trip to Florence to authenticate what Trueblood hopes is a genuine Masaccio polyptych, which he'd bought for a steal at a local antiques shop.  It's an excellent breather, as it were, a genuine bit of comic relief (actually it's difficult to find characters more<br />comical than the Long Pidd crowd, as readers of this series know full well!).  And she offers some<br />good art history lessons as well!<br /> Noteworthy, too, is that the author has taken the time to answer<br />many questions about her characters, especially Jury, himself a survivor of the London Blitz (his<br />mother was killed during a bombing raid and his father died in action as an RAF pilot).  There are<br />few questions about him that can be asked.  Certainly, Grimes seems to feel she's answered them all.<br />She also seems to make this one even more personal to her own nature.<br />A complex man, an ideal protagonist for any novel, Jury is a man who refuses to compromise his<br />well-founded principles, yet compassion, understanding, and sympathy for all those who deserve it<br />are within his character range.  Coupled with these descriptives, Grimes adds her other memorable<br />characters, all  with their own expanse of complexity and depth.<br /><br />All the accolades aside, some readers may find the ending a bit unsettling; indeed, it's a strong<br />ending for a Jury novel. Yet, to the alert reader,  Grimes is fully in charge and the ending is in<br />keeping with the rest of the book, no more, no less.  And one's reaction to the ending, of course,<br />should not be the soul arbiter of the book's effectiveness.  Grimes knows what she's doing.  And her<br />fans will realize this, of course.<br />\\"Not to be missed\\" just about sums it up.  As Will Rogers might have said, \\"I never read a Grimes I<br />didn't like.\\"  \\"The Blue Last\\" holds its own, clearly, in the pantheon of the other 16 Jury books.n to the ending, of course,<BR>should not be the soul arbiter of the book's effectiveness.

In \\"Absence of Nectar,\\" Kathy Hepinstall's second novel, the author continues to give<BR>readers a taste of real, rural East Texas, this time in the 1970s, when Alice Fendar, an<BR>eleven year old, narrates a tale to evoke more suspenseful local color than Carson<BR>McCullers ever could!  Young Alice readily states her objective in the opening pages: <BR>\\"Get rid of Simon Jester.\\"<BR>Simon has suddenly descended upon the tranquility of Alice's home life, when he rescues<BR>her mother from drowning one hot East Texas afternoon.  Meg, the mother, has recently<BR>been abandoned (and divorced) by her husband and despite the efforts of Alice and her<BR>14-year-old brother Boone to cheer her up, her life has slowly and surely slid into statis. <BR>Or worse.  Even her prize bees have begun dying due to her neglect. Hers is a life with the<BR>absence of nectar, and without nectar, the \\"unexamined life is not worth living,\\" to quote<BR>Socrates.  The author's use of this effective metaphor easily balances--and extends-- the<BR>book's theme.<BR>But Simon's opportune appearance seems to be exactly what Meg needs and wants.  He<BR>moves in; they soon become man and wife.<BR>But Simon is an evil man; a man who certainly has a history of his own.  He decidedly<BR>does not like his two step children and goes to great extents to develop \\"tests of<BR>loyalty\\"--which, of course, they fail.  He prides himself as being \\"God's microphone\\" and<BR>justifies all his actions with references to the Good Book.  And while Meg loves her<BR>children, her weakness for Simon is a tragedy a-waiting. Alice and Boone deduce that<BR>Simon is actually going to poison them--they spend hours researching various toxins and<BR>their characteristics; they refuse to eat anything that Simon comes near.  Life grows more<BR>unbearable and late on night, Meg comes in to say good night.  \\"Tears begin to rull from<BR>her eyes and a look crosses her face. She...takes a deep, painful breath, leans down to us<BR>andwhispers a wod that I know must cause her unbearable grief. Run.\\" <BR>To call Alice precocious is perhaps an understatement.  Certainly for eleven years old, she<BR>is more than merely perceptive.  In addition, she also loves her older brother very much. <BR>Boone, himself, is torn between juggling his own religious expectations and beliefs with<BR>his love for Persely Snow, a teenage \\"monster\\" who continues to escape from an insane<BR>asylum, where she's been confined for poisoning her own parents  And Boone is very,<BR>very much afraid of Simon Jester.<BR>At times evocative of Richard Brautigan, Hepinstall's touch for the originality shines. <BR>Alice has a crush on a neighborhood boy, who doesn't seem to know she exists.  \\"Now he<BR>approached me and watched me work, one shoulder slightly lifted, his arms still crossed, a<BR>little red in the eyes as if the chlorine had followed him home like a bully and lived with<BR>him all winter.\\"  Alice's first person account of the story is riviting in most places,<BR>absorbing in the others.  She is a characer to be reckoned with!<BR>All Hepinstall's characters certainly hold their own, in their own uniqueness and in the<BR>depths of their presentation.  Whereas \\"House of Gentle Men\\" was more intriguing<BR>reading, \\"The Absence of Nectar\\" combines the intrigue of the setting, the plot, the<BR>characters with tightly controlled suspense.   Mincing no words--and wasting no time--the<BR>author marches to the exciting climax of the story--one that is not anticipated, yet it is not<BR>the traditional \\"surprise\\" ending.  Some men may truly be evil personified, with no saving<BR>grace, and, if that is the case, Simon Jester qualifies.  Examining this man is to look on the<BR>Dark Side.  It is not a pleasant sight.  \\"The Absence of Nectar\\" will occupy your thoughts<BR>far after you've finished reading it--its messages do not go gently into that good night.	2001-09-16

Certainly Chief Inspector Wexford is \\"out of his bailiwick\\" in this Ruth Rendell suspense! In \\"Speaker of Mandarin,\\" the erstwhile police detective finds himself in China, enjoying the sights. So much so that some sights keep recurring! Even after he returns home to his routine of solving murders in Kingsmarkham! Following the trip to China, one of Wexford's fellow travelers is murdered. And Rendell &amp; Company are off and running. This series, certainly one of the best in the police procedural genre, always provides the reader with plenty of suspense, intrigue, intelligence, and great characterization. In his investigation, Wexford finds that there's more to this group of travelers than meets the ey, much like an Oriental puzzle box: until you press the exact button, it remains a mystery. Through Wexford's skill, ably assisted by Mike Burden with a little help from Wexford's wife Dora, the puzzle--and murderer--is soon revealed. Rendell is true to form here,<br />although finding her in China is a bit surprising! Nevertheless, Rendell fans will applaud and new readers will be impressed! (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2001-08-24

This compendium of gastronomic tales spiced with murder on the menu promises not only to tantalize but to satisfy the reader&#8217;s tastes! In &#8220;Murder on the Menu,&#8221; Peter Haining has edited a delectable collection of food for thought, especially if you like murder mysteries served in full fare! The publishers call this &#8220;the very cream of crime writers,&#8221; although I prefer it as the &#8220;dessert course,&#8221; as full-length novels are more succulent! That said, however, this smorgasbord of delicacies (27 courses in all) is designed to fit anyone&#8217;s tastes! Subtitled the &#8220;Cordon Bleu Stories of Crime and Mystery,&#8221; this anthology certainly offers gournet-strength authors, ranging from P.D. James and Ruth Rendell to Agatha Christie and Patricia Highsmith--with lots of other excellent writers in between. The book is divided into three sections, &#8220;Specialites de la Maison,&#8221; Entrees Historiiques,&#8221; and &#8220;Just Desserts.&#8221; Clever, that. In &#8216;Under the Hammer,&#8221; Inspector Maigret does what he does best (but in a short story) and author Georges Simonon doesn&#8217;t miss a beat, even if the story is abbreviated. In the historical section, a surprising Washington Irving (&#8220;Guests from Gibbet Island&#8221;) adds his uniquely American l9th century touch quite effectively in a little known story (where this one comes from is a mystery, that&#8217;s for sure!). But, for my bet, the best is Dame James&#8217; &#8220;A Very Commonplace Murder&#8221;--proving once more that, indeed, a well-written short story is a work of art in itself. This is a good collection to have at hand! As Bacon wrote much earlier, &#8220;some books are for digesting,&#8221; and this is one of them!	2001-08-24

Mr. Hawke, an acclaimed writer in the fantasy genre, makes his mystery gambit with this one and draws good marks.  While there may be those who wish to compare it to &#8220;Shakespeare in Love&#8221; (or even Kellenman&#8217;s &#8220;Quality of Life&#8221;!), there&#8217;s actually little to compare, at least that would be worth the effort.  This book stands on its own.<br />Having Shakespeare as a co-central character is pleasant enough, certainly original enough, and Hawke&#8217;s powers of description and episode--not to mention his knowledge of Elizabethan history--are enough to make this a worthwhile read.<br /> &#8220;There was nothing quite so invigorating t the senses, Smythe decided, as ending a long and dusty day by being robbed.&#8221;  A good opening sentence, and Hawke, with his unlikely duo of protagonists, is off to trip the light fantastic on the boards of London&#8217;s stage.<br /> Young Smythe, just twenty and a bit of a hunk himself, vows to fulfill what he believes is his true calling--to become an actor!  Of course, with that as the basic quest, Smythe sets out and soon teams up with another wannabe, Will Shakespeare.  Clever and fun, at the same time. Not a heavy-weight, literarily (but how many historical mysteries really are?), &#8220;A Mystery of Errors&#8221; nonetheless  demonstrates careful writing, thought, and a knowledge of the craft. Its pacing is sometimes erratic, but perhaps that&#8217;s meant as literary symbolism to the Elizabethan times!  Regardless, Hawke, we hope, is busy with a second episode of Shakespeare-Smythe.	2001-07-12

Readers of this  suspenseful,  colorful, and mesmerizing series have wondered for quite a while--Who Did It?  Who poisoned Queen Nefertiti, the beautiful queen of the  heretic  pharaoh Akhenhaten!  In &#8220;Slayer of Gods,&#8221; author Lynda S. Robinson feels enough is enough and brings the longest &#8220;narrative hook&#8221; in mystery fiction to a close.  Thank  goodness! This is not to say that this series, now numbering six, isn&#8217;t worth the time it takes (years, if you read them as they were published!).  Dr. Robinson expertly weaves the historic with the histrionic and has, truly, legions of followers.  Her narrative description seems unquestionable, her knowledge of history keen, and her grasp of the basics of mystery writing far exceeds the minimal!<br />This series, her &#8220;Lord Meren&#8221; adventures, is set in the 14th century B.C. and young Tutankhamun is on the throne (and we know it&#8217;s only a brief sit!), but his &#8220;eyes and ears&#8221; (Lord Meren) is directed to solve the queen&#8217;s death, questionable under any circumstances.  Of course, delving into this investigation is far more complicated than it would seem.  Conspiracies abound--some real and some imaginary.  Lord Meren discovers that numerous plots continue to run rampant--from the priests in the temples to outside instigators who stand to gain, not only with Nefertiti&#8217;s death, but that of her husband.These enemies of the state do not hesitate to kill the opposition, often quite cruelly (as we&#8217;ve seen in the previous five episodes, too).  In &#8220;Slayer of Gods,&#8221; Meren finally has his suspects narrowed to one.  It is up to him to catch him, never a more dangerous fiend to be found, a killer who will stop at nothing, as he represents issues far greater than the death of any single invidivudal. Along with Anath,  ( She&#8217;s the &#8220;Eyes of Babylon&#8221;), a sexy spy herself, Lord Meren is determined to find the truth, even at the cost of his own life.

To say &#8220;The Feathery Touch of Death&#8221; is &#8220;par for the course&#8221; would be a cheap pun.  Author John Logue sets this episode to  follow up  &#8220;Murder on the Links&#8221; in the world of golfers. In this story, the setting  is the Open and appropriately at The Old Course at St. Andrews in Scotland.  What a setting it is  What a venue for another murder mystery series!<br />In this one, golf writer John Morris and his girlfriend Julia Sullivan find themselves knee deep in bunkers after a young American golfer is found dead--with an antique golf ball stuffed in his throat.  Soon after, a second murder, also quite savage, is discovered.  Morris and Sullivan think they&#8217;re &#8220;playing at par,&#8221; until they discover they&#8217;ll need a good hanidcap if they&#8217;re to complete this round!  Someone is playing from a great lie! One doesn&#8217;t have to be a golf lover to appreciate what Logue has done here, but perhaps it helps in the appreciation of the finished product.  Logue seems to revel in his golfing lore, the mystique of St. Andrews, the history of the sport.  All this makes a great combination for a great read--plausible, logical, enjoyable.	2001-05-22

In Robert Lee Hall&#8217;s &#8220;Mudrder at Drury Lane,&#8221; we find none other than Benjamin Franklin &#8220;trodding the boards&#8221; and solving a mystery at the venerable Drury Lane Theatre in London.  And for none other than David Garrick, London&#8217;s highest rated actor!  Besides incorporating a special twist to American history, Hall adds another most interesting ingredient--the world of the theatre circa late 18th century!<br />Told in first person by young (and I mean very young!) Nick Handy, Franklin&#8217;s young (and I mean very young) secretary, ward, and constant companion, the story moves along at a rapid pace, as Hall seems to be able to present the period--and characters--in a most interesting manner and fashion.<br />Ben and Nick are engaged to find the murderer (or murderers) in a series of slayings that threaten to close down the theatre! Franklin uses his<br />incredible powers of logic and deduction to get at the bottom of this and before a &#8220;final curtain&#8221; is drawn, naturally, he solves the case. &#8220;Murder in Druy Lane&#8221; is the third in this series and a  good one it is.  A good blending of fact and fiction, coupled with a excellent portrayal of his characters, makes Hall&#8217;s book one not to be missed.	2001-05-22

While not readily available in books stores anywhere, the vintage Barnard (first published in the UK in 1978) is just that:  vintage.  What a delight it is to read Barnard almost anytime, and this one is one of my favorites.  My local library supplied me with this one of his I hadn't read and I was, once again, fascinated with his story line, his characters, his style of writing.  To say he has \\"a way with words,\\" of course, is a great understatement.<br />In this episode, Sir Oliver Farleigh-Stubbs comes up dead--a seeminly perfect inocuous death--the overweight--not to mention overbearing--author simply (right!) collapses while imbibing in his favorite drink on his 65th birthday!  Suspects are a-plenty (as is usually the case with Bernard) and a real shocker arises when it is determined that Sir Oliver's son--who certainly hated him--is to inherit most of the family fortune.  In addition, Sir Oliver's latest manuscript, quite invaluable in itself, is missing.  It is up to Inspector Meredith to find the killer, as murder it is.  Clever, though, the murder has taken his modus operandi from an earlier novel  (\\"The Black Widow\\")by Sir Oliver....  This the Inspector soon picks up on, providing him with valuable clues.<br />Fast-paced, well-organized, and compelling reading.  This is a Barnard--if you haven't read it--you won't want to miss!

And her latest, &quot;Death in Holy Orders&quot; is, once again, James par excellence. What scope, what depth, what sheer writing talent when it comes to a gripping, mesmerizing, no-holds-barred whodunit! James brushes aside her critics and continues writing in the way she knows best, unassuming and literate, psychological and breath-taking!<br />And her main man, Adam Dalgleish, is back, along with his trusted assistants, Kate Miskin and Piers Tarrant, as the superintendent enters ecclesiastical waters in this episode. A theological student has been found dead on the East Anglian shore, a tragedy ruled &quot;accidental.&quot; However, pressed by the student's father, Dalgleish re-examines the ruling and James is off to the races in typical (read that &quot;exciting&quot;) style. Known as the &quot;dark poet of Scotland Yard,&quot; Dalgleish finds himself, once again, in familiar territory, as he recalls having visited the College of St. Anselm in his youth; however, momentary nostalgia aside, he finds more than he could possibly have anticipated. Of course, there is soon another death and Dalgleish's own &quot;little gray cells&quot; begin working overtime! Indeed, this may be the most horrifying case he's encountered, as James explores evil as she's never done before.<br />Once again, James takes some time to present Dalgleish, the man, as well. Each of the books in his series provides more and more insight into this incredibly complex policeman. Dalgleish fans will welcome this, of course. &quot;Death in Holy Orders&quot; is yet another of those books that find themselves almost impossible to put down.

And no Jury book would be complete without close friend Melrose Plant, the aristocratic and (de)titled Peer, whose insight, connections, wealth,  good wit (he does the London Times crossword in record time, whether the answers are correct or not!), and his Aunt Agatha, is of immense aid to Jury.  \\"The Five Bells and the Bladebone\\" is not a book to miss.	2001-03-31

In \\"Father of Frankenstein\\" author Christopher Bram presents a mesmerizing account of the last days of Hollywood (and British) film director James Whale.  Bram's book provided the basis of \\"Gods and Monsters,\\" a 1998 film which drew critical praise as well.<br />Bram provides us with an insider's view of Whale's life--itself something of a horror story. His turbulent life--and lifestyle--haunted him until his death in 1957 (an \\"apparent\\" suicide). Of course, such things that Whale suffered<br />were never publicized--or much acknowledged--while he was still alive.  In this biography Bram seems to pull no punches, as he deftly presents the life of Whale that few outside Hollywood knew (his homosexuality, for instance), especially his background growing up in England, his experiences in World War I, and so on.<br />Whether a fan of Whale (the classic films \\"Frankenstein\\" and \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\" still have a following!) or not, the reader can expect a mesmerizing<br />read--something out of \\"Time\\" magazine and not the \\"National Inquirer\\"!  At times, however, it does resemble \\"People\\" magazine a bit, but  Bram does not resort to bitchy sensationalism to carry the book.  He gives us a very interesting--but not altogether revealing--look at Hollywood in the Thirties.  (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2001-03-28

Period.  However, that said, this is Martha Grimes writing as Martha Grimes, and an excellent job she does, too.  (There's no compelling reason all her books have to be about Jury &amp; the Long Pid Gang--much as we wish they were!)<br />In \\"Cold Flat Junction,\\" Grimes returns to the scene, as it were, from an earlier book (which did involve Jury) called \\"Hotel Paradise.\\"  In an interview in October, 1999, Grimes explained that she was returning to that scene, not that she was tired of Jury, but that she felt that this story needed to be told, as well.  Here, we find young Emma Graham, 12 years old  (and most curious!), and a sleuth in her own \\"write.\\"  The setting is small town America (Grimes is, surprisingly, American) and picks up some three weeks after \\"Hotel Paradise\\" ends.  Emma, precocious that she is, sets out to investigate not one, but three family murders. Sound like too much?  Surprisingly not.  Grimes, truly, is in good from here  (yes, yes, get on with it:  it's NOT Richard Jury!) and with the precision of a talented, if not competent, surgeon, she makes \\"Cold Flat Junction\\" a worthy read.<br />Grimes' style is fresh, filled with good literary allusions and at times a sharp wit.  While the book, granted, is not her masterpiece (maybe \\"Jerusalem Inn\\"?  Yes--it's Jury!), Grimes holds her own--and she commands a large literary field--with this one.

Ms Beaton has, of course, worked out a very successful &quot;formula&quot; for her Macbeth books, but her fans don't really care!  What's fun is reading them!  Macbeth is the local policeman in the Scottish Highlands village of Lochdubh, and, if nothing else, Beaton's characters (primarily Hamish) and the local color (of the setting) are enough to get one going!<br />In &quot;Death of a Dustman,&quot; Beaton's inimitable policeman must find the killer of one Fergus Macleod, local villager only recently appointed as the town's new dustman, in charge of a renewed campaign to keep the area environmentally friendly.  Macleod is a real pain, and, thus, when he is found dead, no one really cares!  Besides turning into a real tyrant--and impossible to deal with--with his silly and petty (but legal) fines of his townsfolk--he is a wife-abuser and into some blackmail as well. And when his body's found, it's poetic justice, indeed:  he was left in a recycling bin.  (If that's not a metaphor, what is!) But, the law's the law and a murder's a murder.  And Hamish must do his duty--regardless of his personal feelings for Macleod!<br />As usual, Beaton provides us with suspects aplenty, and Macbeth's resilience pays off, one  more time!

Camilo Jose Cela's works aren't generally for the masses--often Nobel Prize winners fall into this category!--but don't let his \\"literary success\\" frighten you.  In \\"Mazurka for Two Dead Men,\\" Cela's powerful style (read in translation, of course) is moving, argumentative, sophisticated, sometimes subtle--sometimes not:  in short, an adventure  in literary appreciation at the same time being worthy of one's time.<br />  Set in 1936 at the onset of the Spanish Civil War, \\"Lionheart\\" Gamuzo is abducted and killed, thus setting off  (to borrow from the Greeks) a blood-will-have-blood revenge story.  Tony, his brother, knows that revenge is his.  Cela is high in symbolism as in these events the blind accordian player Gaudencio continually plays the same mazurka--the book echos just about every musical symbol possible, with its themes, moods, movements, rhythms, melodies, and so forth.  Symbolism, too, is not lost on the Spanish society Cela captures and the political, social, and religious overtones are not easily missed.  Still, \\"Mazurka\\" is a worthy continuation of Cela's writing abilities.  Granted, this one's not his best, but still is in keeping with Cela's l989 Nobel Prize winning style.  While, quite likely, \\"something may be lost in translation,\\" still reading Cela, for me, is a pleasurable adventure. (Blllyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2001-03-01

Robert Nye's &quot;Mrs. Shakespeare&quot; is just that.  In this very readable, witty, and enjoyable book, Nye's &quot;central character&quot; (Anne Hathaway) reveals to us the &quot;real&quot; William Shakespeare!  Written some seven years after the Bard's death, the book draws heavily upon heretofore &quot;unpublished&quot; comments/thoughts/reactions by his widow.  No matter.<br />Remember, this is fiction.  And while we are not comparing Nye's work &quot;to a summer's day,&quot; it is magical in its intent.  Nye is quite the scholar, although that seems disguised as he flippantly carries us through Anne's memoirs (&quot;the only happily married couple in all my husband's works are called Macbeth&quot;).  Of course, as &quot;Shakespearean gospel,&quot; there will be the critics and non-believers.  Again, no matter.  It's fiction.  So a little (well, all right, a lot) of leeway should be granted.

One critic has called \\"The Last English King\\" a work that has embroidered fact with fiction, much as the weavers of the Bayeaux Tapistry did. That may be a comment made of whole cloth--or even pulling the wool over our heads--but nonetheless the yarn that Julian Rathbone has spun is a fascinating tale. The author pulls few punches as he needles his way through a carpet of historical myths, tales, and fact in portraying King Harold, unlucky enough to be the last of the Anglo-Saxon kings of England.<br />The year 1066 was the last time that England was invaded by land by foreign troops and but for a few quirks, William the 'Illegitimate' (B&amp;N won't accept the other word!) out of Normandy (responding to the promise that King Edward the Confessor had made to him a few years earlier) invades to take \\"his\\" crown. The Battle of Hasting proves to be William's \\"day\\" and a new chapter of British history is born. In \\"The Last English King,\\" set some three years after the invasion, we find Walt, one of King Harold's personal guards, wandering around Europe, broken, guilt-filled, despondent. He meets up with Quint, an ex-man of the cloth, and they soon decide to journey to the Holy Land, for a number of reasons, catharsis being the foremost (the guilt seems to hang around forever!).<br />Walt, having been the most faithful of faithful of servants to his king, was able to see first hand the plots, the intrigues, the betrayals of the two kings, as they jockeyed for the final thrust for the throne. (Harold had been quickly crowned following the Confessor's death before William could arrive from Normandy.) Clearly, Rathbone favors Harold, whom he depicts as being fair-minded, just, admirable. In turn, it's William who's the heavy, whom he labels a psychopath, among other things. Rathbone's account of the Norman invasion very cleary combines fact with fiction--but understanding this--after all, it's a novel--makes the story flow more smoothly, become more palatable. (Historians certainly will disagree on some of his assumptions and \\"revelations\\"!) That said, however, Rathbone's story is one of intrigue, of despair, of hope, of expiation. It's a book that's filled with \\"historical fare\\"--and one that should keep you attentive throughout.

Ruth Rendell is better known for her novels, especially her Inspector Wexford series, but in &quot;Piranha to Scurfy&quot; she produces a volume of short stories that do her credit.  Writing short stories is not the same as writing novels and Rendell proves she can do both with equal excellence.

Interestingly, she moves her setting from her comfortable England to the colorful American West, Colorado to be more specific, in one of the stories, &quot;Catamount.&quot;  The transition of setting goes well and Rendell feels just at home in America as she does in Kingsmarkham.<br />The title story is a reference to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and the protagonist is a &quot;literary critic&quot; of sorts, who writes to authors pointing out their mistakes.  But don't be misled--this is Rendell at her best, her chillling best.  Small wonder it is the first story (and title) of this collection.  But the other seven are also worth reading, as well.

Ron Goulart's amusing (what would you expect with a Marx brother?) fictional accounting of a zany murder chase is not so farsical as it seems.  Actually, the author, wisecracks aside, has a good case here--and this is the beginning of a series,too! A young actress (could Groucho be involved with any other!) is dead; the police are calling it a suicide; but Groucho is uneasy about all this.  Somehow, the lines aren't straight and the cues are out of sync!  Before the curtain falls, however, our Groucho has brought the house down in this SRO episode.  Bravo, Groucho (and Goulart).

It happened over sixteen years ago--but now, like the troll under the bridge, it raises its ugly head!  This was no ordinary crime--it was an axe murder, the death of an old woman.  Justice was summarily served, with Harry Painter hanging for the crime.  In Ruth Rendell's \\"Sins of the Fathers,\\" we find Chief Inspector Wexford and assistant Mike Burden painstakingly--and painfully--reinvestigating.  It's unusual, of course, in that the Reverend Archery has raised doubts about the crime--fittingly so, as his son plans to marry the daughter of Harry Painter (and, of course, \\"daughter of a murderer\\" doesn't look so good on the bridal registry at Marks and Spencers!).  Rendell's very successful Wexforfd series continues with this episode, which carries its own weight.  Rendell's pacing, her attention to detail, her \\"execution\\" of the police procedural is right on target here, complete with deeply held--and dangerously held--secrets and brilliant crime solving by<br />Wexford and Burden.

If a good draught of single malt and a Hamish Macbeth mystery won't cure you, then you really need to see a doctor! M.C. Beaton's well-established series featuring  Lochdubh's finest, Macbeth himself, is right on cue with this edition.<br />PC Macbeth is called upon to investigate the death of--you guessed it--a \\"hussy\\"!  Seems that Maggie Baird, besides being a wealthy, once-beautiful middle aged woman, is also something of a pain!  So much so that she goes up in flames--in her car!  This is no \\"hot date in the Highlands,\\" but murder out and out!  And there are suspects aplenty:  four former lovers and her own niece!  All certainly had the means and the motive.<br />Macbeth to the rescue, of course!  Hamish himself has a few pieces of personal baggage as well, as we've learned through the series.  His long on-again, off-again romance with Priscilla Haliburton-Smythe, superiors who are jealous of his successes, and his \\"lack of ambition\\" (he's quite happy, thank you, to stay in this wee Scottish village, as promotions are not his desire, prefering instead to stay \\"small town\\"!

The Golden Age of Athens certainly was not without its rust.  In \\"Tides of War:  A Novel of Alcibiades and the Peloponnesian War,\\" Steven Pressfield pulls no punches as he examines with surgeon's precision the affaires de guerre of Alcibiades.  (Pressfield certainly established his historical credibility in fiction--if that's not an oxymoron!--in his earlier \\"Gates of Fire,\\" about the battle of Thermopylae, it itself being a debacle of sorts!)  Told by Jason and Polemides, this is the story of Alcibiades, one of Athens' brilliant and incredibly gifted leaders during the Peloponnesian War.<br />While Pressfield is no Thucydides when it comes to history, certainly he holds his own in historical fiction.  This is a most readable account of the time, the place, and the personages involved, some fifty years following the Battle of Thermopylae.  The author spares no details as he chronicles (far more graphic than the Greek historians did!) not only this complex  leader but of the battles, the intrigues, the conflicts of and among the Greeks of the time.  This classic tug of war between Athens of the Delian League and Sparta of the Peloponnesian League waged on and on, for some thirty years, and among the memorable events are some of the greatest debacles of war history coming at the time of Athenian drama--when such luminaries as Socrates, Sophocles, and Pericles--to name a few--were stellar.<br />Alcibiades exemplifies, perhaps, the consummate politician--he possessed the vital qualifications to be a leader:  he was handsome, eloquent, resourceful, daring, and brilliant.  And equally effective as a general!  Of course, all these qualities also served not only to haunt him, but were responsible for his own death--assassinatin by Polemides, \\"for the  good  of Athens,\\" of course.  Without Alcibiades, alas, Athens lost the war, and, like Rip Van Winkle, the rest is history.	2001-02-03

Simon Beaufort's \\"Murder in the Holy City\\" is the first in yet another historical mystery series--and it's a welcomed entry.  Set in the early 1100s, it features Sir Geoffrey de Mappestone, an English man educated in France, and is now a knight on a crusade to Jesusalem, a city of great contention, dominated at this time by a consortium of religious interests, all eager to make their mark and lay claim to \\"their\\" city.  Religious causes work in strange circumstances, sometimes.  However, religious and internecine strife aside, the city is caught up in a series of kilings---two knights and three priests.  One of the knights is a friend of Geoffrey, who was found stabbed to death in the home of a Greek widow. All appear to have been killed by the same jeweled dagger! Geoffrey takes the commission to investigate and uncovers the plot to destabilize what is already an unnerving scenario and Beaufort's narrative, style, and literary skill take over.<br />This is an exciting \\"first of a series,\\" as the author goes to great effort and detail--with some interesting glimpses of humor!--to portray the time, the place, and the characters.  Beaufort's attention to detail--even if he does employ literary license liberally at times--is a good read.  Sir Geoffrey is one protagonist who's got a good future!

When the facts are laid out by the author, of course, this book,  indeed,  resembles something right out of Aeschylus or Euripides--or for perhaps many of the modern audience--a soap opera.<br />Alas, however, this death and \\"investigation\\"is not fiction and Rapoport is determined that, as in \\"Hamlet,\\" \\"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.\\"  In this case, it's a  peaceful college town in Michigan, complete with its own set of codes, secrets, innuendo, and tragedy.<br />Rapoport's examination of the case is done with an eye to the critical, taking the official police and court findings and, looking askance at what he finds, begins his own investigation, as it were.  His line of thought, his own questions, indeed,  do raise  more than \\"a reasonable doubt.\\"  He also presents the other individuals involved--her family members, acquaintances, and friends, making the \\"Orestia\\" seem somewhat tame! So many questions, so little time--and, to make further the analogy to a soap opera, so few advertisers to pay for opening up this melodrama!<br />Rapoport, who presents himself as a disinterested party, certainly raises enough questions that, to me--or any other third party--should warrant a re-investigation, this time as a homocide.  His thorough backgrounding of the scenario and its players is also impressive. Rapoport, already an established author and literary investigator, present his book in a style that is quite readable without being melodramatic.<br />It will be interesting to see what impact it has on the Michigan authorities.

The author draws readily upon that horror--and blight--of the early 20th century, and he does so with his introduction to the  reader of Inspector Ian Rutledge of Scotland Yard, who has been seconded from London to Warwickshire to investigate the death of gentried Colonel Charles Harris, loved, revered, respected by everybody but one!  Chief suspect, it seems, is Captain Mark Wilton, betrothed to marry the Colonel's ward, and himself a highly decorated war hero and pilot.  Todd's accounting of the horrors, the very carnage of that Great War with its telling descriptions of the trench warfare is graphic and vivid.<br />Rutledge, himself, shell-shocked and uncertain in his own right, sets out his investigation--keeping an open mind and remembering all the while that closed English villages can be just that--closed to outsiders. He must keep, too, his own  recollection of his wartime experiences.  Rutledge is aided, believably, by the voice of a soldier Rutledge had ordered killed in the trenches for disobeying an order (certainly an original \\"Dr. Watson\\" to his \\"Sherlock\\"!).<br />While capturing much local color, landscape and atmosphere, Todd, however, opts for an easy solution, one which is out of kilter with the remainder of the story and thus closes with an awkward stance.  While this is the first of a series--and I am prepared to read the second episode--\\"A Test of Wills\\" falls short of mesmerizing detail, of gripping intrigue. (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2001-01-28

They are ready to enter adulthood but they are stuck literally in the middle of nowhere, a dying, last of the old timer-towns in dusty West Texas.  But as Grace Metalious earlier showed us that beneath the surface of a small town lies a much more involved--even disgusting--involvement and the secrets that lie there do not need to be uncovered.  Uncovered they are, of course, as McMurtry--perhaps on a personal mission of his own--is not content to live with the status quo.  He takes the ennui of everyday life in a small town and, after careful study, surgically exposes them, for better or for worse.<br />This is not a \\"they lived happily ever after\\" accounting.  It is a tumbleweed infested, drought eroded, down-and-out account of the lives of his protagonist, who find (but they've never really expected anything more) that the world is not lit by candlelight, but by lighting, as Tennesse Williams wrote. They view--but never understand--the mysteries of sex and of love.  With McMurtry's sometimes not so subtle humor, these realities are somewhat softened.

And the surprise ending is handled masterly, too! (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2001-01-04

Considering, already, the financial, as well as literary,success of J.K. Rowling, reviewing `Harry Potter and the Goblet ofFire' is almost anticlimactic!  Other than to issue raves--what can besaid?  That she's amassed an incredibly large, almost cultish,following is another given.<br /> Picking up any 700 page book can beintimidating to almost any reader, let alone pre-pubescent ones(Rowling has a large following here!) and `Goblet' is no exception.However, intimidating and even cumbersome it may be, the novel onlypicks up steam as the pages roll by--Rowling seems to magnetize herreaders at an even more intense rate in this, the fourth, Potter book.Harry is now facing in his fourth year at Hogwarts School ofWitchcraft and Wizardry and the summer with his foster-relatives, theDursleys, has been interminable.  However, respite comes along, as theQuidditch World Cup is about to be played and Harry's friends, theWeasleys, have persuaded the Dursley's to permit Harry to attend andto stay the remainder of the summer with them.  And what a World Cupit is!  Harry, the impressionable 14-year-old is all agog over thegame, its players, and the teams' supporters.  But soon, amidst the WCrevelries, havoc descends upon them and Rowling charts her course foran absorbing continuum of this series!<br />It's then back to schoolfor Harry, a new Dark Arts teacher, and the spectacular TriwizardTournament is to be held at Hogwarts, pitting the champions of thethree largest witchcraft/wizardry schools for the first time in agesin amiable competition.  But here the plot begins to sicken!  With herusual skill, Rowling soon has everyone involved in, once more, thestuggle, the manipulations, the deadly force of `good v. evil'!Voldemort has returned!  And Rowling has never been so deadly, soquick, and so judgmental!<br />In `Goblet,' however, the authoraddresses a more mature audience as she examines human rights(Hermione champions house elves' rights to be free), a more adulthuman relationship (Harry and Ron notice the opposite sex in a moremature manner!), and, ultimately, death (a key character dies)--allthree not usually topics in young readers' literature.

Dr. Alex Cross is back in yet another thriller by master-writer James Patterson.  In \\"Roses Are Red,\\" Patterson himself seems to be back, as his latest seems a notch above his last few, in suspense, in thrills, in intrigue, in development!  This time, our Washington D.C. psychologist and police detective faces The Mastermind, a wicked, evil psychopath whose specialty seems to be in arranging clever bank robberies--so clever that the families of the robbers are held hostage (and executed!) if anything goes wrong. Psychotically cruel, he also taunts the police with phone calls and letters--he prides himself in being called The Mastermind!  As in previous Patterson novels, Dr. Cross is accompanied by some of his own personal \\"baggage\\"--his relationship with lover Christine is precarious, at best; Jannie, his daughter has a brain tumor; and, of course, Betsey Cavaliere, his FBI partner on the case, is, well, distracting.<br /> Most important, perhaps, too, is the fact that The Mastermind has targeted Dr. Cross as his next victim.  While, indeed, quite suspenseful, Patterson's works are engrossing and sometimes disturbing, as he seems to be able to \\"capture\\" the mind-set of such a twisted maniac as The Mastermind. His style of writing is fast-paced and by the time the final pages arrive, the climax arrives, explosive and vibrant. (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2000-11-29

And in \\"An Arrow's Flight,\\" this Greek seems to have a real gift!  Mark Merlis has taken the Homerian classic \\"The Iliad\\" and given it a rollicking--and irreverent--\\"updating\\"! However, this \\"edition\\" is more than mere clever anachronism, as Merlis is to be given some credit here.<br />In an odyssey all its own, \\"Arrow\\"  tells the story of how Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, is called upon to \\"pay his duty\\" and come to Troy to help his fellow Greeks achieve victory in this ten-year-old struggle. (The oracle had predicted that it would be Pyrrhus to lead the Greeks to victory, if they were to in at all!)  It's not so easy, though, as Pyrrhus is reluctant to enter the fray--gods or no gods--as he is amidst the high life working as a male stripper in a local bar, and quite in demand he is!  However, of course, he yields to his destiny, and proceeds to Ilium!<br />Merlis, in this story, incorporates a number of socially significant topics--as the themes he uses are easily recognized as themes of the modern gay community.  As with any successful attempt with satire, he takes most serious subjects and hammers at them (sometimes mercilessly) with an Achillian aim. He treats the Homerian epic with respect, however, regardless of his comedy and satire.  Granted, liberties are taken, but, regardless, it's a \\"different\\" and refreshing take on this venerable classic. (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2000-11-29

And with her usual writing abilities, Perry treats her readers to another exciting episode in this series.<br />Extortion is the subject here, as Monk, former policeman and now working privately, is hired to track down a killer who has fled to America, and, combined with murder early on, this investigation begins to have so many aspects that it cannot be called \\"simple.\\"  Perry is good at this, however, and never seems to lose track of her goal.  She is also good at incorporating history into her police procedurals and pulls no punches as she addresses the slavery issue, arms shipments, and medical practices of the time (Remember, Hester was a nurse during the British Crimean War and now renders aid on the Manassas battlefield!).<br />Perry, using her standard powers of description and episode, readily shows the carnage, the butchery of the battlefield in readily graphic depictions.  Her descriptions, as usual, are not for the faint at heart.  By the book's end, of course, Monk has sorted out the convoluted paths to justice and sensibility.

James purists may argue that \\"Devices and Desires\\" is her best work to date, but \\"A Certain Justice\\" is certainly a close second!  Granted, while James seems to devote less time to her leading man, Adam Dalgliesh, she nevertheless succeeds in making a more complete story--concentrating more on other characters and events (almost as if she's saying \\"you already know enough about Adam\\"!).  Still, Commander Dalgliesh is in command and it is through his brilliance that the case is solved (or in this case, \\"cases\\"!).<br /> Basically, Venetia Aldridge, a brilliant, up-and-coming criminal lawyer is found murdered (there can be no other explanation).  As Scotland Yard becomes more involved (after all, it is a murder investigation and the victim is quite prominent in London legal circles), facts begin to emerge that picture a not-so-ordinary past. Venetia is no angel (not yet, anyway!)--there are suspects a-plenty and the motives run rampant, from her cleaning lady to colleagues in and out of court and to her own family members.  She has a past that certainly has cut some crucial corners.  She is also a woman with an attitude--an attitude that seemed not to care about making enemies.  she is also the mother of a teenaged daughter, and their relationship, too, has been a bit tumultuous--dicey at best.<br />Venetia is found stabbed to death at her desk, and a  barrister's wig placed, askew, on her head.  Her body is soaked in  blood. A convenient suspect is hurriedly identified (a sociopath whom she'd successfully defended in a murder trial a few years back!) but, alas, he comes up with an alibi and Dalgliesh must look to others, especially some of her jealous colleagues, for his culprit.  James' plot is, indeed, convoluted and for the casual reader may be hard to follow.  After all, she hasn't been labeled \\"queen of crime\\" for nothing.  Trying to follow the plot is more like trying to find the path in a maze, but that is also probably one of the main attractions for a James novel:  it's not simple.  At the same time, she painstakingly develops her characters, who, simply, are more than one dimensional. While Venetia, on the surface, reflects an organized, planned concept of justice and law and order, James shows us another side--one of justice running amok, of cruelty in the name of the law, and of fair play being something that seems not to exist. And this road to certain justice is one in a state of disrepair, confusion, and blind leads.  It is not without its rewards, however, and by the chilling final-chapters' climax, it is, once again, a jury victory for James!. (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)ames novel:  it's not simple.

Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee, Tony Hillerman's crack Navajo investigators, know treachery, deceit, corruption, wickedness, and tribal politics of their fellow Navajos very well.  In \\"Sacred Clowns,\\" Hillerman is in top form, spinning his web of intrigue, murder, and, indeed, mayhem in the Southwest.  In addition to a taut plot line, in which Leaphorn and Chee are at their best, Hillerman's penchant for presenting the character of these two is superb.  Both are incredibly complex men, yet so vastly different too.  A teacher at a local Navajo school is murdered; shortly afterward another murder, this time at the Tano Indian pueblo.  With the adroit skill of which his readers have become accustomed, Hillerman unfolds his story with the dexterity of a surgeon.  The sacred kachina scenario is one of his finest, as Hillerman evokes the landscape and atmosphere so well.  Hillerman seems to have done more for the preservation of the Navajo culture than just about anyone, yet his<br />story line does not suffer.

It follows Beaton's &quot;tried and true&quot; formula for her Macbeth books, of course. That said, this series is still a most readable, most interesting set, and I wouldn't think of missing one. In this one, naturally the macho man, after threatening, taunting, aggravating, and bullying (not to forget bragging) the locals--which on one occasion leads to a very nasty fight--our man comes up dead. Randy Duggan is so obnoxious that he even gets under Hamish's skin. Duggan issues a challenge to Hamish to settle their differences with a boxing match!

In \\"Death of a Dentist,\\" Macbeth, the lovable, affable, and dedicated local constable in the Scottish Highlands village of Lochdubh, has a toothache (literally!).  He is quite reluctant to have it attended to, as he does not particularly care for the dentist, Dr. Gilchrist, who, among other things, has a reputation for being a womanizer with \\"traveling hands\\"!  And, of course, the good doctor winds up dead--with any number of possible suspects, mainly from disgruntled husbands rather than complaining patients!

Intriguing they are, too.  Someone is bumping off the partners of Peverell Press, a venerable publishing company now on shaky financial legs that rests on the banks of the Thames in a real ediface complex called Innocent House, an opulent Venetian-type of building that is at once a landmark as well as a nest of intrigue, murder, and mayhem, going back a couple of generations to its founder.<br /> As one after another body is found, the pieces begin to come together, although not easily nor fast.  Dalgleish and his two assistants, Kate Mishkin and Aaron Daniel, have their own personal concerns to sort out as well.  James has created a host of<br />excellently developed characters, as she usually does, and the reader is caught up in the problems and affairs of them all.  Finally to solve the case, Dalgleish and company have to look back for their answers, all the way back to World War II France.  The climax comes powerfully in \\"Original Sin\\" and as usual James leaves her readers, not necessarily on a joyous note, but one that is pensive, sometimes even remorseful.  But what a read.

It appears that much of what he had been doing has been a falsehood, that those with whom he had worked--and loved--were, in actuality, \\"working for the other side.\\"  To cut to the chase, \\"the other side\\" now appears to be the insidious work of a Seattle billionaire (made rich through his computer empire) and a<br />puzzling, mysterious, perplexing unit called Prometheus!  All this is familiar territory to Ludlum and his books, but no matter.

And while this may be reminiscent of Mary Stewart's Merlin/Arthur trilogy (\\"The Crystal Cave,\\" etc.), Chamberlin's story stands on its own.<br />As the story progresses Yann and Gilles explore--and embrace--the Old Religion and during ritual ceremonies, Gilles tatoos himself (chin: blue--hence, \\"Bluebeard\\").  Guy de Rais attacks these rituals (he is not an advocate of the Old Religion) and  mortally wounds the hermit. Yann issues a curse (they all die soon after!) and inherits the shrine.  The beauty of fiction is that the author is permitted to take liberties and Chamberlin does with the historical accounts; but no matter.  This is fiction--and fantasy fiction at that--and as such the author has created an exciting, compelling work.  We can only encourage her to publish the next episode.

Not having read the other nominees, I can't compare, but the announcement that \\"The Blind Assassin\\" by Margaret Atwood has won this year's Booker Prize, I am not surprised.  Atwood, having already written over a dozen novels, poetry, children's books, and some non-ficition, comes through with her latest in grand manner.  A prolific writer she is indeed.  That said,  \\"The Blind Assassin\\" is an adventure--not to mention quite an ambitious undertaking--to read.  Included in her convoluted plot line is a \\"novel within a novel\\" (see Reginald Hill's \\"Arms and the Women\\"!)--so be prepared to pay attention.  Atwood's style of writing, however, is anything but convoluted; it is straight forward, but complicated,  with expertly created characters.<br />The book is told by Iris who recounts her sister's death in Toronto in 1945, when she drives her car off a bridge.  The inquest indicates that the death is accidental. Then Atwood introduces us to her \\"novel within a novel\\" entitled \\"The Blind Assassin.\\"  Told by a pair of anonymous lovers, the book stretches into science fiction--absorbing on its own as an intriguing story!  What seems amazing about this work is the expert craftsmanship that Atwood possesses (and presemts),  although, given her reputation, that is not surprising. She also captures the 1930s-40s atmosphere quite well, too! The novel is tiered, and the author explores each level, one by one, until the final pages.<br />With her themes of greed, love, and  (inevitably) revenge, the story is right out of the Greek tragedies (well, actually, not, as \\"tragic\\" is not really exploited!).  Be prepared to spend some time with this work--but it will be time well spent.  What an intriguing novel! (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2000-11-08

Branded by the Church as a heretic and banished from his practices, Galileo certainly, centuries later, is one of history's worst persecuted!  In Dava Sobel's \\"Galileo's Daughter,\\" the author (who also penned the historical \\"Longitude\\") presents another insight into the famed scientific genius.  This story is told by his elder daughter Suor Marie Celeste through her letters to him, which number over 100 and were translated by Sobel herself.  While this may sound as a dull history reading, it is not.  Sobel has carefully taken these letters and made them into her biography (which reads much like a historical novel!), one at once rich with historical settings, problems, and accomplishments.  She shows the anxiety of the great scientist as he faces the Inquisition of the early 1600s, an Inquisition under the demands of Pope Urban VIII that forced Galilio to recant his observations and findings, as, of course, the Church wasn't about to accept anything so preposterous as his theory on the solar system, for instance.<br />Thus, he was found him guilty of heresy and, luckily for Galileo, was only banished  to Siena (later to Florence). Sobel presents through these letters the  famed scientist as being human and filled with more than just anxiety about facing the Inquistion!  The letters are also interesting, touching, and quite revealing of the relationship between daughter and father than at once commands the attention of the reader.She also reveals him to be witty, ribald, poetic, in short, quite human.  This book is an excellent character study and is never dull for one moment (or one letter!).(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2000-11-08

And \\"Death and the Chaste Apprentice\\" is no exception.  Bernard is quite prolific in his writing/subject matter and often chooses literary characters or subjects about which to write.  In this work, we find the London suburb of Ketterick presenting its annual fine arts festival, \\"The Chaste Apprentice\\" being the theatrical entry (an \\"easily forgotten\\" Elizabethan drama!).  Des Capper, the obnoxious Aussie host of  The Saracen's Head Hotel, where the play is being presented and where the actors themselves are residing, is found stabbed in the back--a rather symbolic gesture, as it were, due to Capper's zeal to \\"unearth the hidden\\" from the cast and company.  It appears that all the cast members have their own alibies--as he certainly died during the performance!  Or so we think.  Barnard is always quite clever with his story line--and plethora of literary allusions and references.  He also introduces young Charlie Peace, who is to be featured in later Barnard stories.  This book is fraught with clever theatrical references and idioms and moves along at a fast pace. Barnard's wit and expertise show through readily.  Not a \\"deep\\" book, but certainly a worthwhile one, especially if you like British mysteries with a twist of wry! (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2000-11-06

In \\"The Salzburg Connection,\\" MacInnes once again couples history with the present.  This time, however, she doesn't have to go back so far.  In a deep lake in the Austrian Alps lies a chest filled with Nazi secrets and agents from a number of countries are most eager to get possession of such a potetntial \\"weapon\\"--it doesn't contain literal treasure, but lists of \\"who's who and who's what\\" during the Nazi period.  It is supposed that there are names in this chest of quite successful individuals who were able to escape their (hidden) Nazi past.  You can imagine the urgency to get the chest.  MacInnes is a master at being in control of her thrillers.  Too, she is quite excellent in her description of the settings; her characterization is also superb.  Bill Mathison, a New York lawyer, has the inside track here and must face perilous times in his pursuit.  Along the way, he also meets two beautiful women, both of whom are eager to help him, and one of whom is set to betray him.  In the most deadly fashion!(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2000-11-06

James fittingly wears the crown as \\"queen of the mystery writers\\"! And in \\"Death of an Expert Witness\\" the title is clearly shown and deserved.  Again, James brings in Chief Inspector Adam Dalgleish of Scotland Yard, and once again, this venerable, brilliant, and honorable investigator is in good form.  James usually presents a model in human behavior--she's good at this--and gives Dalgleish the full run to work out the inconsistencies, the red herrings, and finally the truth of the case.  Dr. Lorrimer is a cold, efficient, dislikeable scientist; now he is a cold, efficient, and dislikeable corpse.  Dalgleish must find out why he was killed--and it is more than merely because he was disliked.  What did he know that panicked his murderer?  After all, he was cold, efficient, dislikeable, and very knowledgeable, \\"an expert witness,\\" as it were.

One of the best American writers of police crime fiction today seems to be James Lee Burke.  In \\"Purple Cane Road,\\" Burke provides us with the latest Dave Robicheaux \\"Cajun fiction\\" mystery.  He's back in Cajun country with this episode, after having \\"detoured\\" to Texas for the previous two.  No matter, that.  But it's good to have him \\"home,\\" once again, as his ability to evoke the landscape and atmosphere of modern Cajun/Louisiana country is his strong suit.  With Robicheaux, for those<br />readers who have followed this erstwhile crime solver, we can expect more than just gumbo and etoufee as his bill of fare.  A complex character himself, Robicheaux's background is more completely exposed in \\"Purple Cane Road.\\"  (New readers may find some of the references cloudy, or even impossible, so they may wish to do \\"earlier Burke\\" first.)  In this work, Dave pursues a more personal trail.  He's looking for his mother Mae, who disappeared after the death of his father in an oil rig explosion.  A lead from a pimp in New Orleans sets him off when he reveals that Mae died at the hands of corrupt New Orleans cops, who also happen to be working for the mob.  As typical of Burke, Dave runs a path of conspiracy and corruption that seems to permeate the entire state (could there be a more complex--read that corrupt--city in the South than New Orleans?), and in so doing, a number of sub-themes crop up.  Burke appears to be at his best--or at least among his best!--in this one and previous fans or not, this is an excellent read.	2000-11-04

Of course, the collection is fiction--and should be read as so--but intriguing, exciting, and suspenseful nevertheless.  The subjects range from Richard II, William the Conqueror, Richard the Lionheart, the Princes in the Tower, Edward II, and Henry VIII, again to name a few.

Gunter Grass' \\"Too Far Afield\\" features two elderly German men, Theo Wuttke and Ludwig Hoftaller, and has been called his most complexly written novel of all, and this Nobel Prize-winner has more than his share of complex works.<br />Grass is not an easy man to read; however, that said, Grass and his works speak for themselves quite clearly. Ever ready with the surreal in his works (\\"The Tin Drum,\\" \\"Cat and Mouse,\\" to name two), Grass' grasp of the intensity, the confusion, the excitement, the euphoria, the intense dislike between the two Germanys is in top form in his latest work.  Wuttke and Hoftaller, who are in their seventies,  work for an agency set up to privatize the former East Germany in Berlin in the fall of 1989.  Their thoughts are the vehicle for this book's story line and Grass has poignantly captured the moments.<br />Having lived in Germany before and after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the ensuing reunification, I find \\"Too Far Afield\\" even more relevant.  And the book is not meant to put you to sleep with all its poignancy and nostalgia, and Grass once again explores the relationship of Germany with its often-troubled past to the present.  There are surprising turns, clever humor, and excellent characterization that make the book a worthwhile undertaking. (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2000-11-01

Kaminsky continues his Inspector Porfiry Rostnikov series in grand style--grand, that is, if you like suspense, excitement, great characterization, superb plot--in general, great reading.<br />In this, the 13th of the series, Rostnikov's name is mentioned by a cosmonaut on board the space station Mir (If anything goes wrong, says Tsimion Vladkova as he relates an emergency situation on board, \\"please inform Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov.\\").  Of course, something does go wrong.  Vladkova returns to earth, then disappears.  Rostnikov is told to find him, and his superiors are more than just a little curious as to why the cosmonaut should refer specifically to him!  However, locating  a \\"fallen cosmonaut\\" is not as easy as it seems; the Inspector knows that his case has the highest priority.  No one knows if the Vladkova is dead, kidnapped, or has simply  disappeared on his own.  The government is concerned because he possesses valuable secrets!<br />As usual, Kaminsky has more than one story going on at the same time, all interrelated, and all equally exciting.  One sub-plot deals with a movie director working on the life of Tolstoy whose film negatives have been stolen and are being held for ransom; another involves the undertakings at a paranormal research center, where the director is found murdered.<br />It takes the skill, the intellect, the presence of Rostnikov and his crew (Sasha Tkach, Emile Karpo, Elena Timofeyeva, and Arkady Zelach) to sort out  and to solve all these problems.  Kaminsky seems to have post-Iron Curtain Russia's \\"number\\" and \\"Fall of a Cosmonaut\\" only enhances the series! (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2000-10-17

Sixteen-year-old Charlotte Gravin is unceremoniously raped by three young soldier recruits in rural western Louisiana.  It is late1941, and the whole country is abuzz--certainly preoccupied--with the War.  It is Charlotte's  misfortunate to be a casualty of this war.<br /> This act of violence is  so traumatic that young Charlotte becomes mute (communicating only with  signs and paper and pencil).  She also becomes pregnant by this  violation  and nine months later delivers a baby boy, which she nurses for two days  before abandoning him on a tree stump.  She feels intense hatred for the  three, and all soldiers in general.  She is willing to help support the War  Effort, but not to this extent!<br /> For eight years, she suffers in  silence.  Two weeks before the rape, she had lost her mother in a fire  accidentally set by her younger brother Milo.  She finally decides to go to  the House of Gentle Men, a place set far off the road and where one can  seek solace.  The house is serviced by men, who offer only compassion and  understanding (along with a few kisses and a waltz or two--but no sexual  activity).  These men have themselves come to the House to seek redemption  and expiation from their own sins and demons.<br /> Hepinstall's  characters are just down the road from Faulkner's or from Caroson  McCullers', for that matter. Complex, crude, earthy--each seems to have an  exessive amount of \\"baggage\\" of their own to redeem.  The House of Gentle  Men is just the place. And into its doors steps young Justin, a soldier  just back from the War in Germany, the sole survivor of the three young men  who had raped Charlotte...<br />  Author  Hepinstall provides us with a first-novel of redemption of sin, of sin of  the most egregious sorts, and she does so with a fervor that she sustains  throughout this  work.  Set in her own western Louisiana (she spent some  years there), the Odessa, Texas, native convincingly captures the landscape  and atmosphere of the region.  She has created memorable--and often  disturbing characters... This is a  Deep South setting, but the suffering, the sins, the redemption is  universal. It is at once a love story, too, but a quite unsettling one.  Hepinstall is clearly in command of the storyline and of her characters,  memorable, destructive, and even lovable as they are. Her symbols (fire,  ritual cleansing, water, the House itself) complement the story and the  reader moves right along, unburdened by unnecessary literary devices.

This traveling medieval peddler, romantic, and private detective cannot stand to be cooped up at home, where he should be attending to his daughter and mother-in-law, but he can't. Sometimes on his own volition, sometimes at God's beck (or so he claims!), Roger is always \\"on the road again.\\"<br /> In Kate Sedley's sixth episode is this rather delightful series, we find our Roger on an errand by the Duke of Clarence: deliver a young girl to the home of her finance. It seems that the groom-to-be hasn't shown up to fetch her himself and the Duke hasn't the time to take her either. Enter Roger.<br /> Alas, it turns out that the intended, one Peter Gildersleeve, seems to have disappeared as if by magic, or more ominously, taken by the Devil, or so some folks in this 15th century story want to believe.  Not two days after Roger has delivered the comely Cicely to her betrothed's home, but the groom's brother, too, disappears. What follows is Roger's dedication to solving the mystery, which seems to hinge around an ancient parchment that appears to give clues to an long-lost treasure (Could it actually be the Holy Grail?). Before its conclusion, murder and mayhem--but not much mystery-- prevail and before you know it, Roger is once again the winner.<br /> In \\"The Brothers of Glastonbury,\\" however, Sedley becomes all too predictable and her mystery almost fizzles out.  Her Roger's character, as always, is enough to keep us reading--he's more complex than he wants you to believe, he's less naive than he seems, he's quite clever, especially with riddles, and he's a man after our own hearts: a free spirited individual, one who genuinely wants to do Good and is adamantly opposed to Evil. [...] \\"The Brothers of Glastonbury\\" is a good read--perhaps not a great read, but worth the effort.

Through his eyes we relive the sheer  horror of the persecution of the Jews in Portugal. The Church and the King  of Spain had begun such religious \\"cleansing\\" in 1492 but the more  \\"openminded\\" Portuguese were a little slower in implementing these  Draconian acts.  Leading up to the story is the fact that Jews had already  been rounded up by the Portuguese authorities and either banished or force  to recant (those who recanted became known as \\"New Christians\\").  Many  chose to die rather than recant, of course.  This novel recounts  these last few days leading up to the massacre.  Berekiah's uncle Abraham,  a well-known kabbalist, is found murdered and the storyline assumes a  murder-mystery air, as Berekiah is determined to find who killed him.  It,  indeed, is a complex line.  The young man is determined to find the  answers.  His search takes him through his fellow Jews, Christians, the New  Christians, and the Muslims.  He has the support of his immediate family  and his best friend Farid. (The irony is not lost in the fact that Farid is  a deaf Muslim, also the subject of the Inquisition's cleansing of the  Iberian peninsula.)<br /> The story is told from a modern day standpoint,  the \\"author\\" having found the<br />account in Istanbul in 1990.  \\"The Last  Kabbalist\\" is the first-person accounting of the story by Berekiah, who had  written his memoirs after his own escape from Lisbon to where he eventually  wound up in Turkey, not to be found for some 500 years!  Indeed, the story  is a complex one (Lisbon's \\"O Independente\\" compares it favorably with \\"The  Name of the Rose.\\") and before it is finished, even a convoluted one!  But  no matter, the intellectual twists and turns make the novel memorable, yet  at the same time, haunting.  It is not a story easily forgotten.<br />  \\"The Last Kabbalist in Lisbon\\" is more than just a story of one man's  escape from persecution, however severe that was.  Zimler has presented us  with a riveting narrative that expertly weaves the historical accounting of  this tragedy to a suspense-laden story well worth the read.  He has created  characters of great depth; he has captured the atmosphere of the time; and  he has evoked the emotional responses from both readers and the characters  alike.  The imagery he conjures is rarely paralleled.  While Zimler has  worked through Hebrew, Portuguese, and Spanish translations, he has  completed a well-knit narrative, keeping historical accuracy and personal  emotion in balance, and he does so intensely and passionately.  His writing  style is refreshing, well-paced, and unencumbered as he plays with themes  of death, violence, and even love.

And in her second installment, \\"One Corpse Too  Many,\\" we find the erstwhile Benedictine monk up to his neck in another  murder mystery, this time involving way too many deaths!<br />  In this  episode, Brother Cadfael and his beloved Shrewsbury have the unpleasant  task of burying the bodies of 94 soldiers, killed as a result of a battle  between Stephen and the Empress Maud, both trying to claim the throne of  England.  In this ugly civil war, we find the countryside constantly in a  flux as to which side is which, as this struggle, which lasted for 12  years, seemed to change shapes and sides all too frequently.  In this  instance, it is Stephen who has won the day.  After the hanging of the  hold-outs, Brother Cadfael, representing the church and the Abbey of St.  Peter and St. Paul in Shrewsbury, goes in to arrange for the proper burial  of the dead.  He is told there were exactly 94 bodies.  Instead, he finds  an extra one--that of a young man, unidentified, who has had his throat  slashed.<br />  And Brother Cadfael, over the course of the novel, uses  all his God-given talents to solve the mystery. And solve it, of course, he  does.  He wants not only to identify the young man, but to name the  murderer.  At the same time, Peters, whose real name is Edith Pargeter,  lays the foundation for two of her other recurring characters, Aline and  Hugh Beringer (This is a nice romantic touch!).  Cadfael, himself, is the  herbalist to the abbey and uses that skill to help him solve the murder.  He is also able to call upon some of the knowledge he learned during his  younger days as a Crusader to the Holy Lands.  In all, Peters has created a  full-blown medieval character--one who is at once ever the romantic, yet is  worldly enough to negotiate the foibles of reality.  Peters and Cadfael add  up to a great literary combination and their numbers prove  it!<br />(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)l add  up to a great literary combination and their numbers prove  it!<br />(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2000-08-22

Marston continues his Ralph Delchard and Gervase Bret series in a  convincing manner!<br /> Ralph and Gervase are dispatched to Canterbury to  help solve a dispute between the cathedral and St. Augustine's Abbey  involving some land, not to mention liturgical authority.  This  complementary duo are royal officials commissioned by King William to see  that justice is meted out and the issue settled.  The entourage includes  Ralph's new bride (Golde), Canon Hubert, Brother Simon (all whom we've met  in previous episodes) and their military retainers.  They are eager to  dispense their judicial findings.<br /> Alas, a young girl is found dead  and at first she is assumed to have died from a poisonous snake, as the  teeth marks are readily seen.  However,  we soon begin to suspect  more  than accidental death and, true to Marston's nature, we have a full-blown  mysstery on our hands.  It will take all the logical skill Gervase has, the  military bearing of Ralph, and the religious observances of the Canon and  Brother Simon to unravel this conundrum.  Before its solution, however, we  find that, indeed, a serpent has invaded the community, in the form of  heresy, and the story takes on even greater meaning.<br /> Marston's fifth  tale begins rather slowly, but with patience the reader will find that the  narrative begins to jell and the desire to find out the solutions to all  the problems compels one to complete the book.  Marston seems to have some  trouble with his dialogue, especially the passages involving Delchard and  his new bride.  These conversations borders readily on the stilted, as of  course, even in 11th century England meaningful conversation between  husband and wife  would not be this formal!  But that aside--and do push it  aside--the book is worth reading through.  Marston writes with a social  conscience, especially as he deals with the leper issue, and, quite  importantly, the relationship of the church with its dissident priests (who  seem fully justified in their dissidence!).  The author has also spent some  time in the presentation of his characters, all the while trying to keep in  mind that this is England just after the Norman conquest.<br /> \\"The  Serpents of Harbledown\\" ends another episode in the King's commissioners'  efforts at demonstrating the king's justice, to Norman, Saxon, and Church  member alike. Marston seems fully in command of his characters, his plot,  and his themes.<br />(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)tly, the relationship of the church with its dissident priests (who  seem fully justified in their dissidence!).

Robert Barnard is certainly an author with dramatic flair.  His novels are always a treat--even an adventure--to read, as this prolific writer seems  to know no boundaries  when it comes to exciting, readable prose!<br />  For example,  \\"The Corpse at the Haworth Tandoori\\" is a worthwhile  excursion into Barnard territory.  This time it's to Bronte country in  Yorkshire (one of his favorites), more specifically to Haworth and its  nearby community of Ashworth.  A corpse is discovered in the boot of a car  parked at the Haworth Tandoori restaurant.  The body is clad only in  underwear, there's no identification, and shows signs of grim mutilation.  And it's in the jurisdiction of Detective Constable Charlie Peace and  Detective Superintendent Mike Oddie, two policemen extraordinaire we've met  in previous Barnard works.<br /> The duo finds the body eventually leads  them to Ashworth, a collection of artists, wannabes, and hangers-on where a  young Irishman Declan O'Hearn had come to seek employment and has now  disappeared.  The body is identified as his.<br /> Barnard is known for  his stylish twists, his clever plot designs, certainly his way with words.  His prose is generally salted with plenty of creative expressions and  humor--in short, never a dull minute--yet at the same time, he is able to  sustain a gripping suspense that makes it difficult to put the book down.  Don't be surprised at the surprises, and Barnard knows how to deal them out  and not put off the reader.  He is a master at characterization and young  Declan is well drawn, as, indeed, are his other characters.<br />  Peace  and Oddie are able to unravel this puzzle, mainly with good police work and  with some luck, too.  Along the way, we meet members of the Ashworth  community who are clearly not who--or what--they seem, and the revelations  of this mystery unfold, logically, plausibly, and with much certainty.  In  police procedurals, perhaps there is nothing new under the sun, but in this  one, Barnard takes his plot designs and strong characterization and  presents a novel well-worth one's time.  Barnard's a good writer and in the  course of his some 30 novels gives us a smart taste of Yorkshire and the  Bronte moors.  \\"The Corpse at the Haworth Tandoori\\" is a delectable buffet!<br />(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)one, Barnard takes his plot designs and strong characterization and  presents a novel well-worth one's time.

I just run very fast.  I  am also not a fool,\\" who lives by his favorite maxim:  \\"He who fights and  runs away may get out of fighting on another day.\\" And author Clynes makes  him the ultimate hero of Tudor England (among his boasts:  being special  adviser to King Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey, confidant of Catherine of  Aragon and Anne Boleyn, and lover of Elizabeth I and the father of their  \\"love child.\\"  He also claims \\"ownership\\" to several of Shakespeare's best  lines.  The Bard, Shallot, and Kit Marlowe are all drinking and wenching  buddies! (An original fairy tale!)<br /> Whatever.  What Clynes does,  however, is weave a yarn that is entertaining at best; however, the author  is quite an authority on medieval England and his expertise is readily  apparent in his descriptions of the period.  While his concoctions may be  historically far-fetched (and far from actuality!), still, his \\"accounts\\"  offer a literary intrigue (if not a \\"gossipy account\\" of the times!) and an  enjoyable tale!<br /> In this episode, Shallot finds himself involved in  another of Henry's misadventures. The Great Mouldwarp of Merlin's  prophecies is ever so insecure about his own kingship and now messages  arrive signed and sealed by King Edward V (one of the little \\"princes of  the Tower\\" of Richard III fame), demanding that Henry pay extortion fees.   Henry expects Shallot to solve the problem and clean up the mystery.  Intrigue and murder/mayhem follow, one after the other and rivals Act V of  \\"Hamlet\\"for seeing which has more dead bodies!<br /> Light, light, light,  but clever, clever, clever.  And amusing.

As if one body isn't enough, there's a second, then a third!  Will the  killing ever stop?  In Kate Sedley's sixth Roger the Chapman medieval  mystery, the author goes to the very frozen core of her adventures--the  \\"dead\\" of winter!  And it takes every ounce of mental firepower for Roger  to sort this one out.<br /> Roger, a traveling peddler (or chapman) who  has been successful in thwarting out  murderers before, finds himself weary  of the homelife during one 15th century winter in England.  Wanderlust and  adventure in his blood soon win out and he's on the road again.  This time,  he encounters a very popular traveling Dominican friar, Brother Simeon, who  is determined to save every soul in his sight with his ultra-conservative  sermons.  The two are paired together as they approach Cederwell Manor,  Roger to sell his wares and Simeon to save their souls.  Alas, upon their  arrival they discover, at the bottom of the manor tower, the body of Lady  Cederwell herself, who had sent for the erstwhile friar.  Her death appears  an accident but both Roger and Simeon suspect foul play.  The next morning,  Lady Cederwell's half-brother is found unceremoniously dumped--and very  dead--in the well of the manor.  Within another 24 hours, a hermit, who had  befriended Roger earlier, is found dead among the frozen undergrowth.<br />  Roger, of course, knows the murder is among those who are presently in the  manor. (And it's a manor that's filled with so much \\"sin\\" that the pious  Lady Cederwell had summoned the friar for his help--it seems the manor's a  real Sodom and Gomorra!) The weather is so bad that no one can come and go.  With his usual diligence--coupled with a charming naivet&eacute;, good humor, and  strong personality--Roger considers all the ingredients to this murderous  bouillabaisse and fighting time comes up with the real killer in an  exciting climax to a well-written tale.<br />  \\"The Wicked Winter\\" is  probably the most thrilling of Sedley's series, which begins<br />with \\"Death  and the Chapman.\\" As with most of the series in this genre, one doesn't  necessarily have to begin with the first-written, but there are a few  elements included that not having read the earlier books the reader may  miss out upon, but not so much as to ruin a good tale.

Three times previously, Owen Archer has come to the aid--even rescue--of King Edward IV as well as the Archbishop of York and in this fourth adventure, Candace Robb has woven another medieval murder mystery spell  that will absorb you until the  very end!<br /> In \\"The King's Bishop,\\"  Owen, the former soldier  and now one-eyed spy for Archbishop Robert  Thoresby of York,  finds himself embroiled in one of history's more in-  triguing plots.  King Edward wants to nominate a favorite as a bishop, from  when he could then be in line to be named chancellor of England.  But Pope  Urban sees it differently, and thus the power struggle begins.  This story  is one of intricately-patterned designs, based upon historical fact.  Author Robb, however, tosses in the fictional interests and we are off and  running.<br /> A young page is found dead at Windsor and Ned Townley, one  of Archer's friends, is accused  of murder.  Alas, the king's mistress  Alice Perrers provides him with an alibi, but the suspicion, of course,  remains.  Ned is assigned to accompany the king's delegation heading north  of confer with a local Cistercian abbey to enlist their support of his  bishop's nomination.  This removes Ned from the scene, but not without  complications. Shortly after he leaves, his betrothed (and lady in waiting  to Mistress Perrers) is found drowned in the Thames.  And as Ned and his  group near the abbey, a priest is murdered.  Ned is in big trouble. In  addition, a priest is also found murdered.  All three deaths are, of  course,  inter-connected.<br /> Having a friend like Owen Archer counts  for something and during the course of this work, Archer is determined to  exonerate his friend, even though much evidence implicates Ned.  Archer is  married to Lucy Wilton, noted York apothicary, and Robb uses this scenario  well to her advantage.  Lucy is level-headed, calm, logical--in short, the  very counter ego of Archer.  It is their relationship that provides much of  the human<br />interest in this series, as well.  Robb draws heavily on  historical perspective, yet has  an eye on what should have been in terms  of the place of women in medieval society. There is a lesson here.<br />  The novel moves well and readers who appreciate historical ventures will  find this one to their tastes.  Robb's works show much research (she  provides annotation at the end of the book) and she concentrates more on  the personalities of her characters that attempting to condemn or condone  what historically was.  She also does a good job of capturing the Yorkshire  countryside, its manners and atmosphere.<br /> Other good news is that  Robb continues her series--there is a fifth Owen Archer!

To Inspector Morse fans and other knowledgeable readers, clearly the \\"outcome\\" of  the venerable--but irascible--detective should be known.  The book's been on the shelves long enough for the word to have gotten around.  It's his swan song; author Colin Dexter says \\"adieu\\" to the series, and  readers move on.<br />That said, \\"The Remorseful Day\\" perhaps should have  read, \\"The Remorseful Series,\\" as, indeed, Dexter has chosen a most apt  ending for his parade of intriguing, exciting, and most worthwhile \\"cases.\\"  Certainly his bread and butter, the Morse series has given Dexter a most  respected name in this genre and naturally it is with some sadness that we  view the finale.<br />As such, perhaps, Dexter does not give us his best book;  he didn't save the best for last.  However, it seems that was not his  intention.  Dexter, in an interview on TV last year, indicated that \\"The  Remorseful Day\\"was more a tribute to Morse than just another mystery in  this popular series.  Thus,  he seems to give a valedictory to Morse as his  primary concern and the mystery-storyline becomes secondary.  He puts the  final touches on Morse's character, and Morse can now \\"go gently into that  good night.\\"<br />The storyline is simple enough:  a year-old murder of  Yvonne Harrison is re-opened and  Morse is reluctant to head the  investigation; between Supt. Strange and Sgt. Lewis, of course, Morse  finally is &quot;coaxed&quot; to enter the picture.  The plot spins along  at a faster pace than Dexter usually employs; he now concentrates on  putting the final (pun intended) touches to Morse. It is a brave adventure,  knowing there are countless Morse fans and the slightest errant way will  bring forth a reader revolution!  In this book, Dexter dramatically  displays his ability to control absolutely the tempo of the narrative and  the reader finds a faster-paced  work being slowed down by the reality of  the situation:  it is high drama without the  melodrama; it is sadness, yet  Dexter handles it with literary class.

Against the advice of many of his advisers, Akhenaten proceeds to change  the Egyptian theological concept of multi-gods into a monotheistic concept.  Needless to say, this does not go well with his subjects.  Changing the  tenor of the religion, however, is only one concern Akhenaten faces.  With  Drury's renowned patience for detail and historical research, the novel  examines the numerous aspects of the pharaoh's life, especially his  relationship with Nefertiti and of his zeal to produce an heir.  He  doesn't, of course, and therein lies many of his problems.<br />  \\"(Akhenaten) was perhaps the most human and touching of all the Pharoahs,  for he greatly tried, and greatly failed, to bring to humanity a universal  symbol of love.\\"  And it is the trials--and these failures--so poignantly  presented that makes this book well worth the read, not just to  Egyptologists, but to the layperson as well. Granted, not all authorities  agree on Drury's interpretations (Drury points that out in his  introduction), but the author's research and theories are academically  acceptable, although there is disagreement in familial structure,  relationships, pronunciations/spelling that experts may (or may not)  recognize.  Regardless, Drury's skill as an outstanding author carry the  book along at an amazingly fast pace--almost if you were riding the current  of the Nile itself.  \\"Fascinating\\" is, indeed, an apt description of this  book.<br />(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)as an outstanding author carry the   book along at an amazingly fast pace--almost if you were riding the current  of the Nile itself.  \\"Fascinating\\" is, indeed, an apt description of this  book.<br />(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2000-06-21

This sequel is even more  mesmerizing than the earlier work.<br />  In \\"Return to Thebes,\\"  Drury's depiction of the Eighteenth Dynasty, its intrigues, its murders, it  romantic twists--all become bared as this ill-fated kingdom struggles with  vengeful opposing priests, its own family members, even, perhaps, the gods  themselves.  It is Akhenhaten's zeal to make The One True God (the Aten)  supreme that is his tragic (and literal) flaw. In this book, the deaths of  Akhenhaten and Nefertiti set up the reign of the very young Tutankhamon.  Alas, of course, even his reign is ever so brief and Drury contrives to  convince us of the conspiracies that bring about his demise (or, as Drury  shows, murder!).<br /> Dramatically presented, this story line captures  the reader from the start as<br />Drury brings, vividly, to life the court of  the Eighteenth Dynasty, or some 3300 years ago.  Granted, as this is a work  of fiction, some literary license must be permitted (or else it's called  non-fiction) and later Ancient Egyptian mystery novelists (especially Lynda  S. Robinson--the Lord Meren series--and Lauren Haney \\"Right Hand of  Amun\\"--both excellent writers, incidentally) show some disagreement with  some of the historical points.  But no matter, Drury, as he writes in his  thorough<br />introduction, explains any inconsistency that the reader--or  expert--may find.<br /> For sheer drama, however, this book is hard to  beat and Drury is true to form!  I found his Egyptian tales more  fascinating that his \\"Advice and Consent,\\" for which he was awarded the  Pulitzer--and that's saying quite a bit!<br />(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2000-06-21

This \\"knight in tarnished armor,\\" as Time magazine called him, is as pertinent today as when \\"The Green Ripper\\" was published in 1979.<br />  Travis, once again,  is confronted with his own mortality when Gretel, the woman he feels he is  truly in love with, is murdered.  McGee, as in episodes past (and this is  the18th) feels that retribution, or justice, whichever comes first, is  something that he, personally, must pursue.  The \\"game is afoot,\\" as it  were, and the chase leads us through the forces  of a religious cult (quite  the topic in 1979), the Church of the Apocrypha.  Travis \\"joins\\" to gain  their confidence and little does he know the far-reaching ramifications of  this group. The author cites George Santayana in a preface statement:  \\"Fanaticism is described as redoubling your effort when you have forgotten  your aim.\\"  And when you have finished \\"The Green Ripper,\\" fanaticism is  spelled with a capital \\"F\\"!<br />  Probably, \\"The Green Ripper\\" is  the most suspenseful of the McGee series (always characterized by a color  in the title).  MacDonald is methodical in his plot developments and while  suspense is naturally a necessary ingredient, in this book it becomes  perhaps the most important aspect.  But the author stays true to McGee,  probably Florida's most famous literary character, and readers will not be  disappointed.  As in the other books, vivid description, poignant  characterization, and a top-drawer storyline, marked by sparks of good  humor, are MacDonald's trademark. It's a worthy  read!<br />(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2000-06-21

In \\"Free Fall in Crimson,\\" the 19th Travis McGee episode, author John D. MacDonald refuses to be tied up with boundaries.  In fact, this book seems a great deal like a geography lesson, as the plot takes him from Ft.  Lauderdale, to other Florida parts, to Beverly Hills, and, finally, to Iowa  for the climactic scene!<br />  However, readers should not let that put  them off another top-flight installment in the McGee series--this time  involving, yes, a murder and other corruption,  a hot<br />air balloon  competition.<br />  The plot is set aloft when Ron Esterland approaches  Travis for help--seems he's been completely cut out of his inheritance when  his father was murdered two years earlier (most of the estate has been left  to his estranged wife and her filmmaker friend).  Ron wants Travis to find  the truth about the murder, suspecting that the wife and friend had much to  do with it.<br />  Travis' pursuit then takes him cross country,  eventually landing in Roseland,<br />Iowa, where a film is being made about a  hot-air balloon meet.  As with the other McGee stories, MacDonald keeps us  on the edge until the final pages.  It is not that we don't know the guilty  party; it is just that Travis must find a way to secure justice--usually  his own brand--as many of the guilty are \\"out of bounds\\" to legal  prosecution.<br />  Readers will not be disappointed in either the story  or McGee!  While the series does not require a chronological reading,  the  earlier books establish the characters (especially McGee and economist  friend Meyer).  The first book is \\"The Deep Blue Goodby\\"--and it's a good  place to get started, to \\"channel\\" the McGee interest.  But regardless,  \\"Free Fall in Crimson\\" merely adds to the charm of the series and of the  character--it will leave you grasping for air!<br />(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2000-06-21

And in this20th--and final--chronicle of Brother Cadfael, Ellis Peters takes us a giant step forward in her characterization of the good Benedictine monk, a man once a member of the Crusades and now wrestling against sin behind the cloth.<br /> In \\"Brother Cadfael's Penance,\\" Peters permits Cadfael to come face to face with another aspect of his life--a time before his monastic vows.  It is 1145 and the great civil war rages on between King Stephen and Empress Maud.  However, there is hope.  A meeting between the two factions is scheduled for Coventry and Brother Cadfael secures permission from the Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in Shrewsbury to attend.  Known widely for his skills in diplomacy, as well as crime solving abilities, Cadfael, however, wishes to attend for a very personal reason. He is seeking news of a young knight, Olivier de Bretagne. Olivier is Cadfael's son, from his days fighting in the Holy Land as a crusader.  His holy vows aside, he feels he must do all within his power to save his son.<br /> Peters, as always, presents Cadfael as more than human--she gives us a man for all seasons, as it were.  In addition, she presents the good brother in a realistic but incredibly humane manner.  He is a man whom we can love, respect, yes, even<br />cherish.  Peters' ability to draw out these characteristics is perhaps what makes the series so fascinating.  Hers is a series not to be missed.  One probably should read them in the order they were written; or at least, read earlier ones before this one, as the poignancy of the meeting between father and son is so much more dramatized when the reader has the background to appreciate such a climactic episode.  I cannot imagine a reader being disappointed!<br />(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2000-06-20

It goes without saying that stealing is one of the sins in life--and with her usual characteristic zeal, author Ellis Peters adds murder to that list!<br />  In \\"The Holy Thief,\\" the 19th chronicle of Brother Cadfael, Peters continues her top-flight form of the medieval whodunnit and, as  usual, her protagonist, the good Benedictine monk, rides to the rescue and  solution.<br />  The year is 1144--and still King Stephen and Empress Maud  are struggling in an interminable civil war, with no solution in sight.  However, that historical fact is mere backdrop--as it usually is--to a more  local concern.  A renowned earl (Essex) is killed by an arrow, but not  before he tries to make amends with Heaven by restoring some of the  properties he had earlier \\"gained.\\"  This includes the abbey of Ramsey, a  run-down site badly in need of more worldly help.  The abbey sends envoys  out, and one such envoy arrives in Shrewsbury, at the abbey of Saint Peter  and Saint Paul, Cadfael's domain.  The envoy includes Brother Herluin and  his young novice Tutilo, who possesses a great singing voice along with  other musical skills.  In Shrewsbury is also, as the plot would have it, a  beautiful slave girl (also a singer) named Daalny.<br />  Suffice it to  say, Peters lays a solid romantic setting.  But the rains come, so much so  that much of the abbey's possessions, including the holy relics, must be  moved to safety.  But not so safely after all, as a theft is discovered.  And this soon leads to--you have it--a murder.<br />  And Cadfael takes  over.  Using not only his brilliance, but his skills as the abbey's  herbalist, Cadfael wastes no time in carefully solving the crime.  Of  course, as in all the Cadfael adventures, the murder is solved.  The  solution rarely comes easily for this ex-crusader, nor should it.  Peters  does not rush into her novels, which are characterized by logic and sound  research.<br />  Peters' very successful series has been adapted to TV,  and while the episodes are generally very good, the televised portrayal of  both Cadfael and the story line leaves quite a bit to be desired, as good  as they are.  The books are the better choice.

In \\"Death of a Scriptwriter,\\" M.C. Beaton brings us the fourteenth installment of the Hamish Macbeth series--and she is in her element! <br />Set in the Scottish Highlands, in the village of Lochdubh, this series is a  nice read--nothing too complicated, full of local Scottish color (with both  its characters and its setting), lots of delightful red herrings, and  logical solutions. This series, the titles of which always begin with  \\"Death of a...,\\" is quite a successful one and one which takes little time  to read. Macbeth, the local constable, is proud of the fact that he is not  an ambitious soul. Despite the fact that he has solved thirteen previous  murders, he is still a constable. He refuses to be promoted as he claims he  is too happy in Lochdubh to want to advance to a larger city. He is filled  with lots of common sense and while often the villagers give him a hard  time (\\"He's too lazy,\\" they claim.), they highly respet him and have come  to his rescue more than once.<br />He's not so lucky with his own love life,  however, and seems to fall in love with any woman who shows interest. The  real love, Priscilla Smythe-Halliburton, has moved to London, after he had  broken off the engagement, and appears intermittently in all the books of  the series.<br />In \\"Death of a Scriptwriter,\\" a television crew appears in  Macbeth's bailiwick to film a novel written by an English spinster who has  moved to Lochdubh. Her books were never much of a success, but this one was  picked up by the BBC. She is delighted that at long last, fame is coming  her way. She is so overjoyed that she fails to retain the complete rights  to her book; a screen writer is hired to \\"modernize\\" the plot and  characters (in other words, to add lots of sex and violence to the rather  staid Victorian tale). Disagreements among the TV crew members erupt and,  viola, the screenwriter (an impossible sort, unliked and unloved by  anybody, and quite impossible to work with) is found dead; shortlythereafter, the star of the film (who is to appear nude in some scenes) is  killed when she \\"falls\\" off a boulder; her alcoholic husband has also been  found dead! (Bodies seem more plentiful than the last act of \\"Hamlet\\"!)  Everyone seems to be a suspect! Macbeth, in his plodding, but thorough way,  of course, leads us to the conclusion, wherein all deaths are solved, and  the reader then is set up to await the next installment.<br />This book is a  fun-read. Ms Beaton is in her element--she's writing about what she seems  to know a lot about herself--authors, screenwriters, and television crews  (this series is being filmed in England and we can only hope that A&amp;E  or PBS will bring it to us over here!).

(Some say, it's because they want him out of Moscow for a while!)  With his wife, he is all set to take some needed rest  and recuperation.<br /> But this is a Stuart Kaminsky work and his  fictionalized inspector is not about to be left alone in peace and quiet.  In no time, naturally, he is involved in another murder--a fellow policeman  is killed in less than honorable circumstances. So, Rostnikov's dreams of  beach-side relaxation, of making sure his convalescent wife follows the  doctors' orders, and of reading his favorite novels (American Ed McBain!),  are put on hold.<br /> The circumstances, indeed, are harbingers of what  is happening in Moscow as the Iron Curtain is rapidly being packed away.  The USSR is falling apart!  Meanwhile, back in the capital,  Rostnikov's pair of assistants, Emil (\\"The Vampire\\") and Sasha Tkach, are  investigating crimes dealing with computers and psychos!  \\"Rostnikov's Vacation\\" is yet another installment in a very exciting series  set in the USSR.<br />The eighth in the series, readers have come to  recognize--and respect--Kaminsky's penchant for detail, for finely-tuned  characterization, and for thrilling resolutions.<br /> The major fault in  Kaminsky's work is that he doesn't produce his Rostnikov stories fast  enough!<br />Billyjhobbs@tyler.net	2000-05-09

And  Grimes doesn't let up until the final pages.<br /> Marshall Trueblood  (one of Grimes' recurring characters and resident antiques dealer in Long  Pidd) discovers a dismembered corpse in an antique desk. Superintendent  Jury soon establishes a connection between this death and the murder of a  Limehouse lady named Sadie Driver.  With his faithful Sergeant Wiggins,  Jury begins to do what he is best known for:  solving crimes. And no Jury  book would be complete without close friend Melrose Plant, the aristocratic  and (de)titled Peer, whose insight, connections, wealth,  good wit (he does  the London Times crossword in record time, whether the answers are correct  or not!), and his Aunt Agatha, is of immense aid to Jury.  Grimes titles her Jury books with names of actual pubs.  If you track this  one down (there's a good map in the book), be careful!

In this installment of the 21-episode series, McGee finds himself in Hollywood, helping out some friends and trying to solve the murder of  Lysa Dean, a super starlet sex symbol, some very unseedy characters, and  lots of blackmail!<br />  As the \\"Sunday Telegraph\\" wrote,  \\"...MacDonald stirs in a touch of Oedipus trouble, a touch of alcoholism,  and a touch of lesbianism, and gives his engaging private investigator,  Travis McGee, some straightforward enjoyment as well.\\" In this no-holds  barred book, the reader's view of humanity is not white-washed (MacDonald  never does this) and the greed, lust, jealousy of humanity's detritus are  never more vividly depicted.<br />That is not to say, however, that there  aren't bright spots in the book.  For one, McGee, whom Time magazine calls  a \\"knight in tarnished armor,\\" does not disappoint us.  Sometimes, it  appears as if he's the only level-headed, sane person in the story.  MacDonald's first-person accounting of the McGee stories never get in the  way and as one follows the series' progression, one is able to see the  goodness that McGee personifies.<br /> The first book in this series is titled  \\"The Deep Blue Good-by\\" and ends with \\"The Lonely Silver Rain,\\" pubished  shortly before MacDonald died.

Kaminsky's Inspector Porfiry Rostnikov series and you like intrigue, foreign settings, absolute suspense, and logical conclusions, you have missed a literary treat.<br />     Kaminsky,  writer of such successes as the Toby Peters series, the Lieberman series,  and the \\"Rockford Files,\\" writes most knowledgeably of Moscow and its  politics, its social intrigues, its criminal elements, and he does so most  convincingly with his Inspector Rostnikov, an iconoclast among the Soviet  system and is always one step away from being \\"shipped to Siberia\\" (or  worse) for his independence.  However, his crime solving abilities are so  brilliant that he manages to stay \\"on board.\\"<br />     Rostnikov is a war  hero \\"almost single-handedly stopping a Nazi tank\\" and highly decorated and  praised by his Moscow superiors.  He is left with a mangled leg, however,  and over the course of the year, despite the lingering pain, has overcome  its handicap, primarily by his daily routine of weight lifting, the love  and support of his wife and son, and his own strong will and determination.   His wife is Jewish, and owing to the (still) anti-Semitic attitudes of the  political system there, the inspector continually has to face reality.<br />       He has assembled his own loyal supporters within his office:  Emil Karpo  (the policeman nicknamed \\"the Vampire\\") and  handsome Sasha Tkach, as well  as other acquaintances.  Readers seem to look forward to seeing each of  these in each of the episodes, almost as if they are family members.           Kaminsky has the ability to penetrate the smog, the freezing  temperatures, the long lines at the shops, the graft and corruption  seething ubiquitous-like throughout the Soviet system, and in a way that  perhaps no outsider could do.  It is amazing, especially if you've ever  been to the Soviet Union, how he does this!<br />      In \\"A Cold Red Sunrise\\"  the inspector has been assigned to Tumsk, a far-flung town in Siberia,  \\"where the temperature is forty below on a good day\\"!  His assignment has  come due to one of his clashes with the KGB.<br />    Two people are dead, one  of them the daughter of a famous dissident, and the other a Moscow police  officer sent out to investigate her death.  Now it is Rostnikov's turn to  solve the crime--and the KGB  hopes he won't succeed.  But Porfiry is not  without his own inimitable resources and once again his brilliance as a  police detective emerges.  Naturally, there are implications that go all  the way back to Moscow and somebody's political intrigue there.  But  Rostnikov must  tread lightly, as if one ice, as he knows one mistake and,  war hero or no, he is doomed.          Fortunately for him, his Siberian  assignment is for only one novel!  There is no doubt in the reader's mind  that Rostnikov will find the solution, but the suspense is still there all  the same.

And even more so when this body is presented as a transvestite  prostitute!  All Venice is  in an uproar!<br /> Donna Leon returns  triumphantly in another of her brilliant Commissario  Guido Brunetti  episodes, and the reader is not left for one second in anything but  gripping suspense.  Leon, an American writer who is enjoying incredible  success at  writing police procedurals set in Italy, presents \\"the Pearl of  the Adriatic\\" in more than all its glory.  With Brunetti, she explores not  only its grandeur but reveals the city's mud as well.<br /> Just as the  body is not as it seems, Brunetti finds that there is even more deception  to come.  Two more bodies are found that are related to this case, and the  author examines more than just police procedures here, as she seems to do  in all of her novels.  The various aspects of Venetian life are examined,  the corruption of government officials, the criminal activities (covering a  wide range of subjects from drugs to illecit sex trade), and, of course,  the personal lives of her central characters.  She has a great knack for  character presentation that make them more than just \\"interesting and  lovable\\"!  I have found few authors who do so with such dedication and  thoroughness.<br /> Leon, who lives in Italy, certainly seems to know her  subjects well, beginning with the first Brunetti novel, \\"Death at La  Fenice.\\"  None of her books should be missed, not simply because she has a  glorious setting, or fantastic characters, or plots that are convincing,  but simply because she is a good read!<br />Billyjhobbs@tyler.net	2000-05-06

Probably not. It's the home of Travis  McGee, \\"knight in tarnished armor,\\" and central character of the over-20  volumed series by John D. MacDonald.<br />  With quite a following of  readers around the world (my first McGee was while vacationing in  Torremolinas years ago and needing something to read while soaking up the  Spanish sunshine and absorbing the sangria deliciosa!), MacDonald's hero,  along with his sometimes bizarre assortment of friends, enemies, and  hangers-on, goes from one adventure to another.  Each of the McGee books  contains a color in the title, easily recognizable.  And it's not purple  prose either!  MacDonald, a best-selling novelist for years, has more than  just a storyline to carry his books. Certainly, McGee is his principal  concern.  He's \\"retired\\" most of the time--he  only goes back to work when  he sees he's running out of money.  He'd rather stay aboard his houseboat  and entertain his friends that work.  He claims he's taking his retirement  one day at a time!<br />  \\"The Deep Blue Good-by\\" is the first in this  series, published in 1964.  It is amazing, too, that in reading it here in  the year 2000, the book still stands as relevant now as it was then.  McGee, as usual, finds himself befriending and then helping out Cathy Kerr,  who has come to him in desperation.  Her misfortune has been to meet up  with Junior Allen, \\"a smiling, freckle-face stranger\\" with depravity on his  mind and a more odious person you don't want to meet.  There is also  something about missing inheritance.  McGee is unable to resist and from  the moment he accepts the challenge, the reader is glued to the pages.<br />MacDonald's style is terse (some would say Hemingwayesque--one of  MacDonald's favorite writes, incidentally) and moves rapidly, a pace easy  to keep up with but one that if you blink, you might miss something.  But  who wants to blink when MacDonald is  on a McGee crusade!  The author's  knack for piercing characterization, his ability to capture the landscape  and atmosphere of \\"Lauderdamndale,\\" and his penchant for a good story make  this first episode one not to be missed.  True, the McGee books ordinarily  don't have to be read in sequence, it's still a good idea.  Over the course  of the series, naturally, an affinity toward complete understanding of  Travis, and his good friend Meyer, keeps readers truly involved.<br />  \\"The Deep Blue Good-by\\" is a \\"hello\\" to a great series!<br />Billyjhobbs@tyler.netth but one that if you blink, you might miss something.

It is also the setting in this thriller, the first of a series by Donna Leon, titled \\"Death at La Fenice.\\"<br />  La Fenice is the name of Venice's famed opera house and  in this novel, death is the event de jour, as a well-known German conductor  Helmut Wellauer is found dead in his dressing room, shortly before he was  to conduct \\"La Traviata.\\" Of course, the show must go on.  Of course, the  police must be called.<br />  And we are introduced to Guido Brunetti,  vice-commissario of police in Venice.  He's also a brilliant detective.  With suspects galore, Brunetti finds the early going to be confusing and  not all what the \\"facts\\" may seem.<br />  In Brunetti, Donna Leon has  created the quintessential police detective.  He is a man whom we are proud  to call an acquaintance as we follow his trail in all the Leon books.  She  describes him:  \\"He was a surprisingly neat man:  tie carefully knotted,  hair shorter than was the fashion; even his ears lay close to his head, as  if reluctant to call attention to themselves.  His clothing marked him as  Italian.  The cadence of his speech announced that he was Venetian.  His  eyes were all policeman.\\"<br />  Leon, in addition to being a first rate  novelist, has been an American English teacher aboard, and  healthy  international sales have made her vision of Venice well known.  She seems  to love the city, but with an attitude that shows her feet are on the  ground.  She lets Brunetti characterize the city:  \\"And then he was at the  water's edge, the bridge to his right.  How typically Venetian it was,  looking, from a distance, lofty and ethereal but revealing itself, upon  closer reflection, to be firmly grounded in the mud of the city.\\"<br />  One of the chief suspects is diva and prima donna soprano Flavia Petrelli,  who certainly has motive, and is high on Brunetti's list.  Flavia, along  with her American archeologist and companion Brett Lynch, present more than  a conundrum to Brunetti.  (We are re-introduced to them in a later book  Acqua Alta.)  This is no easy crime for the commissario to solve.<br />  Leon creates, certainly, one of the best police procedurals of the last  decade. Her books are hard to come by in the U.S., but she has a large  following in international circles, especially in Germany and in England.  While it is not necessary to read her books in order, naturally, her  progression moves more smoothly when done so.  \\"Death at La Fenice\\" is pure  symphony and not a note is to be missed.<br />Billyjhobbs@tyler.nete than   a conundrum to Brunetti.

It is not the summer of his discontent, washed by the sun of Yorke; however, it is the season for another Cadfael adventure and mystery!  And Ellis Peters, in her usual intriguing way, presents us with her 18th  Brother Cadfael episode in \\"The Summer of the Danes.\\"<br />  The year is  1144--the civil war between King Stephen and Empress Maud still rages  on--and Brother Cadfael is called upon to be an interpreter to the Welsh  village of Saint Asaph.  Cadfael is Welsh born and he welcomes the journey  to his homeland as a pleasant break from his duties as a brother at the  Benedictine Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in Shrewsbury.<br />  As  it turns out--and naturally, as this is an Ellis Peters mystery!--a Danish  fleet is sighted along the coast of Wales, a real menace, indeed.  Then a  young girl goes missing.  Then a body is found.  And Cadfael is off and  running.<br />  So is the reader!  Having read all the Brother Cadfael  series, I found this to be one of my favorites.  Peters wastes no time in  developing her story and does not hesitate to flavor her plot with plenty  of Welsh history and lore. Will the Danes invade?  Will the murderer be  brought to justice? Cadfael's expertise, once again, proves to be essential  in the resolution of the crimes.<br />  Cadfael is the former crusader now  turned monk who, while not solving murder cases, works as the Abbey's  herbalist and is known throughout the area for his skills in medicine.  The  \\"Sunday Express\\" writes:  \\"Cadfael...springs to life in her books, which  are novels with depth.  He is a man of warmth, humanity and engaging  nosiness.\\"<br />  Do not be misled by the British TV series of the Cadfael  stories.  While on the surface they are quite adequate (Derek Jacobi is an  ideal Cadfael), the 50-minute recounting of any of Peters' books does not  do justice to the novel, which is a pity, for there are great gaps of  (mis)understanding that simply cannot be supplied in such short time.  Stay  with the books!  They are well-worth the read.  Cadfael is a character  worth knowing!<br />Billyjhobbs@tyler.netme.  Stay  with the books!  They are well-worth the read.

Kaminsky's Inspector Porfiry Rostnikov series and you like intrigue, foreign settings, absolute suspense, and  logical conclusions, you have missed a literary treat.<br />  Kaminsky,  writer of such successes as the Toby Peters series, the Lieberman series,  and the \\"Rockford Files,\\" writes most knowledgeably of Moscow and its  politics, its social intrigues, its criminal elements, and he does so most  convincingly with his Inspector Rostnikov, an iconoclast among the Soviet  system and is always one step away from being \\"shipped to Siberia\\" (or  worse) for his independence.  However, his crime solving abilities are so  brilliant that he manages to stay \\"on board.\\"<br />  Rostnikov is a war  hero \\"almost single-handedly stopping a Nazi tank\\" and highly decorated and  praised by his Moscow superiors.  He is left with a mangled leg, however,  and over the course of the year, despite the lingering pain, has overcome  its handicap, primarily by his daily routine of weight lifting, the love  and support of his wife and son, and his own strong will and determination.  His wife is Jewish, and owing to the (still) anti-Semitic attitudes of the  political system there, the inspector continually has to face reality.<br />  He has assembled his own loyal supporters within his office:  Emil Karpo  (the policeman nicknamed \\"the Vampire\\") and  handsome Sasha Tkach, as well  as other acquaintances.  Readers seem to look forward to seeing each of  these in each of the episodes, almost as if they are family members.  Kaminsky has the ability to penetrate the smog, the freezing  temperatures, the long lines at the shops, the graft and corruption  seething ubiquitous-like throughout the Soviet system, and in a way that  perhaps no outsider could do.  It is amazing, especially if you've ever  been to the Soviet Union, how he does this!<br />  In \\"A Cold Red Sunrise\\"  the inspector has been assigned to Tumsk, a far-flung town in Siberia,  \\"where the temperature is forty below on a good day\\"!  His assignment has  come due to one of his clashes with the KGB.<br />  Two people are dead, one  of them the daughter of a famous dissident, and the other a Moscow police  officer sent out to investigate her death.  Now it is Rostnikov's turn to  solve the crime--and the KGB  hopes he won't succeed.  But Porfiry is not  without his own inimitable resources and once again his brilliance as a  police detective emerges.  Naturally, there are implications that go all  the way back to Moscow and somebody's political intrigue there.  But  Rostnikov must  tread lightly, as if one ice, as he knows one mistake and,  war hero or no, he is doomed.  Fortunately for him, his Siberian  assignment is for only one novel!  There is no doubt in the reader's mind  that Rostnikov will find the solution, but the suspense is still there all  the same.  This series is absolutely mesmerizing and, to me, Kaminsky can't  write them fast enough!<br />Billyjhobbs@tyler.neteria,  \\"where the temperature is forty below on a good day\\"!

In the tenth installment of the ever-so-popular Brother Cadfael series, author Ellis Peters proves a winner once again with \\"Dead Man's Ransom.\\"<br />  Set in the year 1141,  civil war runs amok  in Britain between King Stephen and  the Empress Maud, and it appears that the end of the twelve  year old struggle is in sight.  The war has taken its toll in many areas,  as civil wars do, and the people are quite weary of it all.  Maud's forces,  however, now have captured the king himself.  The sheriff of Shropshire,  too, has been taken captive.  This means, in those days, that in all  likelihood an exchange of prisoners will take place.<br />  Alas, one of the  captives is now dead and it is our Brother Cadfael who senses that, indeed,  it is murder, and, just as naturally as Peters would have it, it is he who  is given the responsibility to solve the case and to try to bring about the  release of the king.<br />  Brother Cadfael is the former crusader now a  Benedictine monk, who specializes in herbal medicines, solving murders, and  compassion.  Peters (Edith Pargeter) has developed her Cadfael through this  series of medieval whodunits  into a man of the cloth easily admired and  respected.  He is a man of firm, and devout, principles; a man who seems to  carry the weight of the shire on his own Welch-born shoulders!<br />  Peters has made grand the area of Shropshire, and especially the town of  Shrewsbury there on the Welch borders.  She has also created an exciting  family of literary characters to complement Cadfael:  Hugh Beringar (deputy  sheriff of the shire and Cadfael's closest friend) and his wife Aline,  Abbot Radulfus (the venerable patriarch of the abbey, and other members of  the abbey.  It is not essential that this series be read from the  start (with \\"A Morbid Taste for Bones\\"), as this book could easily be read  first and it would still hold up as a book on its own; however, readers  generally will want to read them in order, as the presentation of  character, of historical events, of character-interaction does show  development in the series' genealogy.

His is a past that at first seems incongruent  with the life of a monk, but God works His<br />wonders in many ways, and, as  no sinner is beyond God's mercy, as Cadfael likes to say, he has now found  his place on earth.  \\"(He) himself found nothing strange in his  wide-ranging career, and had forgotten nothing and regretted nothing.  He  saw no contradiction in the delight he had taken in battle and adventure,  and the keen pleasure he now found in quietude.\\"<br />He is a specialist in  medicinal herbs and is in charge of the herbarium; he is a man of God  gifted in logic and fair-play; he is a man of great understanding and  compassion; and he is no fool.  In \\"A Morbid Taste for Bones,\\"  Cadfael is assigned by his prior to lead a delegation to a small village in  Wales to acquire the bones of their patron saint, Saint Winifred.  As  Cadfael was born in Wales and naturally speaks the language, he is the top  choice of the priory.  But retrieving the relics is no simple task, as  Peters displays, and before long a murder is discovered.  Cadfael's  expertise comes in handy, as \\"his skills as a herbalist are matched by his  prowess as a detective.\\" And with Peters' abilities as a Grade A novelist,  the reader is kept spell-bound until the final pages of this medieval  thriller, a story well-developed and strongly-paced. It is a literary  journey well worth the price!<br />The author is the recipient of the Crime  Writers' Association/Cartier Diamond Dagger Award for her Cadfael books,  and has written a number of other works, including her Inspector Felse  series.<br />Billyjhobbs@tyler.net, as \\"his skills as a herbalist are matched by his  prowess as a detective.\\" And with Peters' abilities as a Grade A novelist,  the reader is kept spell-bound until the final pages of this medieval  thriller, a story well-developed and strongly-paced.

A longtime fan of Rendell's Chief Inspector Wexford series, I  believe this is my favorite, and I've read them all.  Rendell, often called  the \\"Queen of Crime\\" by the Brits (in fairness, so has P.D. James and Ellis  Peters--it depends on which publisher you're reading, I suppose!) presents  her lovable Wexford and assistant Mike Burden  out to solve another crime  in Kingsmarkham.<br />  Police are called when three bodies are discovered  shot at Tancred House; only the seventeen-year-old daughter of one of the  victims survives; it is from her that the police get their initial clues.  As the story develops, of course, not all the clues are what they seem.  Wexford is at his best and as the list of suspects continues to grow, it is  his remarkable powers of deduction and intuition that prevail.<br />  Along  the way, the chief inspector must struggle with a rift he has recently had  with his daughter Sheila--this affects his abilities to see clearly,  too.<br />  The \\"Sunday Times\\" writes that \\"Ruth Rendell has quite simply  transformed the genre of crime writing.  She deploys  her peerless skills  in blending the mundane, commonplace aspects of life with the potent, murky  impulses of desire and greed, obsession and fear.\\"  In \\"Kissing the  Gunner's Daughter\\" she holds the reader spellbound to its explosive end.

Set in Russia amid the rumblings and eventual fall of the  Iron Curtain, the series captures convincingly the Russian atmosphere,  politically, socially, criminally, and with such conviction, especially for  an American writer who has not devoted his life to Russian studies.<br />  In \\"Death of a Russian Priest,\\" Inspector Rostnikov, accompanied by one of  the few individuals he can fully trust, journeys to Arkush to investigate  the murder of a local priest, an outspoken cleric and one whose death has  shocked the local community.<br />  Of course, as with all the Rostnikov  books, nothing is as it seems and it takes the cunning, the skill, and the  intellect of his team to bring all this together.  He and Karpo, known as  \\"the Vampire,\\" are busy solving this murder while meanwhile back in Moscow,  Sasha Tkach, Rostinok's handsome and randy and very married assistant, is  involved in another investigation.  Tkach has a new partner, Elena  Timofeyeva (which opens up other complications!), and they are trying to  find a missing girl and a cold-blooded killer.  Kaminsky manages to tie  these assignments together and quite satsifactorily by the book's  conclusion.  He, once again, has managed to provide humanity in an area  where little is often found!

It appears the villain has been narrowed down to three, but still the suspense lingers on.  And as \\"Drinker of Blood\\" was published in 1998, will there be another episode?  Let's hope so.<br /> That being said, Dr. Robinson's research and knowledge of the Amarna period is well documented.  She is able to carry us on her literary barge with sufficient interest as she continues to explore all the possibilities of the Queen's death.  There are enough enemies about--and Meren is not always certain as to who is who!--that he must tread carefully. Meren's investigations seem thwarted at every move. However, he feels he is making some progress and this frightens his enemies. And such enemies abound that early on, Meren is framed for an assault on the young King Tutankhaten and is on the run for his very life.  Fortunately, he has the loyalty and love of his family, especially his adopted son Kysen and daughter Bener; together they work diligently to assist Meren.<br /> Needless to say, Meren is redeemed before the book is finished and his relationship with the young Pharaoh seems cemented once again.  Now, the responsibility is placed upon the author's shoulders.  It is she who must enlighten us and we await eagerly her next episode, which, perhaps, will present us with the real culprit.<br />(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net) END	2000-05-03

It is up to the Fat Man,  Dalziel, to sort it all out and to direct us, in his inimitable fashion, to  the conclusion. He describes Dalziel with the typical Hill wit: \\"Then he  (Dalziel) smiled benevolently around the listening room like a medieval  pope after a good burning and said, 'Nice to meet old friends, isn't  it?'\\"<br />Along the way, of course, we get caught up in Hill's literary  libations (mainly through Ellie Pascoe's Comfort Blanket, a  for-her-eyes-only \\"mock epic\\" featuring, no less, Odysseus and Aeneas in  the same story!). The author borrows not only from Homer and Virgil but  from Charles Dickens, as his drama sometimes becomes melodrama, and all the  myriad \\"loose ends\\" he's created them are neatly packaged by the time the  novel ends.<br />Still, Hill's characters--helped along by the British TV  series--are memorable ones and the author certainly holds his own in that  pantheon of contemporary British mystery writers. \\"Arms and the Women\\" is a  compelling read (Ellie's Comfort<br />Blanket is WELL worth the read! One  could simply read it as a separate novel and it would work!) and not one to  be missed. Olympian laurels to Hill!<br />Billyjhobbs@tyler.net	2000-05-03

Riveting it is not; mesmerizing it is not; interesting and worth your time, it is.<br /> Thus, readers who journey down the Elizabethan roads of Leonard Tourney's \\"Old Saxon Blood\\" are hereby notified.  In this, the sixth Matthew and Joan Stock novel, we find this venerable duo from  Chelmsford all set to venture out on yet another quest for Crown and  Country.<br />  The aging Queen Elizabeth I (after all, it is 1601  and her days are numbered!) summons the Stocks for an audience and reveals  to them the mysterious death of Sir John Challoner, found drowned on his  estate.  She fears it is more than accidental and requests that the Stocks  investigate.  After their arrival at Thorncombe, the Challoner  estate in Derbyshire, the Stocks soon find that other murders quickly  follow (they have 30 days to settle the issue).  And Tourney leads the  reader to a swift--albeit easy--conclusion.  For readers of historical  fiction, this book is worth the time and effort, although any<br />suspense is  less that compelling!  Still, it's a good read (although perhaps the  author should select another editor, as the book has a plethora of  typographical miscues  and-- horror or horrors--even a grammatical error or  two to spoil the Queen's English!).  In addition, it appears a bit too  pedantic at times (\\"Outdoors, the effulgent moon sufficed.\\").  However,  Tourney does provide us with a realistic view of some of the lifestyles and  accommodations of the period, as well.  (Another interesting note is his  treatment of Sir Robert Cecil, one of the Queen's top advisers and quite  the positive character in this book.  Judith Cooke, in her \\"A Slicing Edge  of Death,\\" portrays him as an odious chief of spies, and a character we  readily despise.)<br /> As in the other episodes of this series, the  author is quite in command of his subject matter and is a delight to  read.<br />Billyjhobbs@tyler.net	2000-05-03

In \\"The Slicing Edge of Death,\\" author Judith Cook takes another look at the death of Christopher Marlowe, and in so doing,  naturally, adds another segment into the death of this renowned Elizabethan playwright.  Long one of England's perplexing mysteries, Marlowe's murder has brought more than a  few theories as to the real reason for his death, much of it to do with one  conspiracy or another.<br />Officially, Marlowe's demise was  ruled as \\"death  by brawl\\" by the Queen's coroner in 1593.  However,  centuries later, the  controversy--even confusion--continues. And historians and novelists have  attempted to solve this historical conundrum.  Judith Cook's version is  well-written and documented, yet, as she maintains, her work is fiction.  Still, the author's style of writing and her ability to keep the reader in  tow are to her credit.  Assembling a cast of real and imaginary characters,  Cook takes us to this ultimate date (May 30) in a systematic, yet  absorbing, manner.  The<br />reader will not want to stray from its pages for  long!<br />\\"There was no reason why anyone, least of all William Bradley,  should have known that 18 September 1589 was to be the lasts day of his  life.\\"  Thus begins this \\"roman a clef\\"--a great narrative hook sure to  snare even the most skeptic of readers.  Thus, in chapter one we meet  Christopher (Kit) Marlowe, playwright and poet extraordinaire, involved in  one of his notorious street brawls.  Marlowe's predilection for such  behavior, as well as for his brilliant plays (\\"Tambourlaine,\\" \\"The Jew of  Malta,\\" \\"Edward II,\\" and \\"Dr. Faustus,\\" principally) and poetry.  A  contemporary--and some say rival, of Shakespeare, Marlowe's short life was  filled with not only his brilliance but his controversial--even for the  Elizabethans!--lifestyle.  In addition, the author downplays the \\"rivalry\\"  between him and Shakespeare, which really is unimportant in this work.  It  is documented, too, that Marlowe had been in the employ of the Queen's  secret service and had, indeed, worked on a number of cases involving the  gathering of secret intelligence for the government.<br />In this book, the  author uses Marlowe as a man who enters--and often exits-- the lives of her  other characters.  It is through the eyes of these characters that we view  much of Marlowe, although he, himself, certainly plays a large--and  vital--role. The environment we are introduced to is that of the world of  the players, the actors and producers of the theatre.  During this time, of  course, London is visited by the plague, intense court intrigue, and other  subterfuge.  All these elements combine to make \\"The Slicing Edge of Death\\"  compelling reading, especially for those readers interested in history  stories.

In her latest Inspector Wexford mystery, Ruth Rendell adds another notch to her string of mystery \\"wins\\"!  While it may (or may not) be her best Wexford installment, her latest \\"Harm Done\\" certainly is one of my favorites.  The author--ever so aware of current issues--does not shy away  from yet another socially significant and controversial issue.  In fact,  she tackles more than one in this thriller.<br />  For starters, a  pedophile is released from prison to live in one of the council<br />houses in  Kingsmarkham.  Naturally, the community is literally up in arms.  And, more  to the point, this novel addresses spouse and child abuse in its various  forms, and the readers cannot escape this thematic approach to another of  our societal aberrations.  Along the way, a policeman is killed by a mob  protesting the pedophile's presence, and, eventually enough, there is a  murder for Wexford to solve.<br />  The inspector is not without his trusty  assistant Mike Burden, and plod they do to solve the case, as much by  intuition as by logic and cold facts.  Wexford has made a reputation for  being able to \\"sense\\" the solution in the previous Rendell books.  Kingsmarkham, too,  has become a regular community in literary geography.  The book begins with the disappearance of a teen aged girl, who,  miraculously re-appears three days later;  in one week, another teenager  disappears, and then re-appears. The third person to go missing, next,  however, is a three-year old child and the community becomes aflame with  violence, as they lay the crime to the pedophile. Mob action follows and in  their \\"reactions,\\" the policeman is killed by a firebomb.<br />  Rendell's  penchant for social issues makes her works worth reading anyway; if nothing  else they raise a sense of social consciousness and awareness.  In \\"Harm  Done,\\" she takes us from one set of family suffering from abuse to another,  but not in the sense that it's overkill (pun intended).  There is a feeling  of disquietude, even depression, as she lays bare the abuse.  This is not a  book that will fill the reader with gaiety and humor; nor should it be. She  is serious about her subject, and it's a subject that her readers,  themselves, should be serious about.  She also makes a stab  irresponsibility of the tabloid press!<br />  Thus, the novel progresses and  subsequently ends.  And another chapter in the Wexford family has been  unveiled.  The inspector is a deeply fair man, one who  firmly and fully  believes in justice and it is his determination to uphold justice that  makes us appreciate him so.<br />  Rendell, who also writes under the name  of Barbara Vine, has been labeled the \\"Queen of Crime,\\" as well as having  been awarded a number of prizes for her novels.  Her works are  thought-provoking and far from simple.  One cannot read her without being  affected in some positive way.  It is a pity that the BBC's \\"Ruth Rendell  Mysteries\\" do not play in America, as most of her Wexford mysteries have  been filmed--and fortunately remain true to her books.

It's the \\"most scholarly\\" of the Hugh Corbett mysteries!<br />  That's easy to conclude, as the setting of this tenth mystery in this series is in the university town of Oxford!  P.C. Doherty has put his super sleuth, actually the \\"king's clerk,\\" Sir Hugh Corbett, to work solving a tiresome  problem for his friend and majesty King Edward I in \\"The Devil's Hunt.\\"  Severed heads of beggars are found in the wood around Oxford --witchcraft,  Satanism, and rituals of the \\"old ways\\" spring to mind and Edward will have  none of it.  In addition, the Bellman has posted several notices around  town warning that his revenge will know no bounds. He is determined to  avenge the death and degradation of de Montfort, Edward's enemy in a civil  war some 40 years earlier.  And corpses of college officials begin  appearing, reflecting the handiwork of this unknown Bellman.<br />  Hugh is  called out of retirement and agrees to help the king.  Thus, with his  trusty assistants Ranulf and Maltote, Corbett strikes out for Oxford and  for what he hopes is a quick solution to the king's problem.<br />  Unfortunately, it is not so simple.  More murders occur and the plot (and  blood) thickens.<br />  Naturally, by the time this tenth installment of the  Corbett series comes to a close, all is well for the king.  There are some  sad turns of events in store for readers who have followed this series,  however.  Doherty's plot seems far more researched, more complicated  than some of the earlier works.  His ability to juxtapose the events of the  late 13th century with modern thought and reasoning--not to mention writing  styles!--is well documented. He clearly is able to make modern audiences  appreciate that time period for what it was--oftentimes cruel, far less  refined, and justice at the caprice of the king.  He captures the tone and  atmosphere of medieval England quite well.<br />  The author, who writes  under a number of other names as well--Michael Clynnes,<br />Paul Harding,  Paul Doherty, Anna Apostolou, to name a few--seems a dedicated historian  and well worth the time spent in reading his exciting--and convincing--  historical mysteries.

Thus, it has proclaimed  that henceforth, only two theatre companies will exist in London.  On top  of that, all acting companies performing in courtyards will be curtailed as  well.  Hence, the Westfield Men face what appears to be the \\"final curtain\\"  of their careers. Their patron, Lord Westfield, has his own misgivings and  is ready to release his sponsorhip.  What to do!<br />  Behind the guidance  of Bracewell, the company decides to build its own theatre and to compete  intensely for the right to perform.  Murder and mayhem follow as the plot  sickens!  One of the actors is found murdered under the pilings of their  new theatre; Nicholas is badly beaten; members of the company are being  lured away by the rival companies, one by one.  Alas, a secret benefactor  appears, ready to save the company and to provide a much needed loan in  order to continue operating and to build the new theatre, named The Angel.  And along the way, there are bits and pieces of romance!  We continue to be  enthralled by the thespian antics of the leading actor, Lawrence Firethorn,  and the other members of the company:  Edmund Hoode, Barnaby Gill, Owen  Elias, and the actors' nemeses:  Sybill and Alexander Marwood (owners of  the Queen's Head, where the company performs).<br />  Marston is able to  sustain the mystery, the interest, the intrigue of this well- researched  novel of Elizabethan England and theatre and it is to his credit that the  storyline carries well.

In \\"Curtains for the Cardinal,\\" the author spins  quite the tangled web in this tapestry of a plot set in Renaissance Italy.  And the vision of dukes and princes and clerics is<br />not altogether a  happy, or pleasing, one!<br />On a visit to the Duke Livio's estate,  Sigismondo, always followed by his half-wit attendant/confidant Benno and  his dog Biondello, is witness to the Duke's famed \\"fit of rage&quot; (some  would call it madness!).  In this one, he decapitates his own son!  Sigismondo seizes the moment and, quick-thinking man he is, spirits away  the Duke's daughter before she also befalls such a fate.  The Lady Minerva  has been promised to another Duke's son in marriage, in what could be  foreseen as a great political coup between the two families!  Minerva is  quickly whisked out of town and safely hidden.<br />We then meet Cardinal  Petrucci.  If ever there was a Church official not deserving of his rank,  this Cardinal is he.  Conniving, lecherous, greedy, the Cardinal gets ready  to further his own causes when, viola, up in flames he goes, the victim of  an assassin.

Historical mysteries  have seemed to appear with a leap and a bound over the past several years, due to the amazing fascination that readers have with this genre.  And Elizabeth Eyre's contribution in 1991 with \\"Death of  the Duchess\\" is a welcomed--and respected--inclusion.  The first of  the series, \\"Duchess\\" introduces us to Sigismondo, an independent solver of  crimes.  Set during the Italian Renaissance, the book quickly captivates  the reader as the daring Sigismondo is commissioned to find out where an  abducted daughter of a local aristocrat.  The daughter is from one of the  leading families of duchy (a di Torre) and it is suspected she is the  victim of a plot by the other leading family, the Bandini, due to an  ages-old hatred.  Earlier, the daughter, Lady Cosima, had been betrothed to  young Leandro Bandini, as per the Duke's command so that the feud could be  ended once and for all.<br />  Not that it is so easy, however, for the  Duke's own wife is found murdered in her chamber.  Young Leandro is found  unconscious in her chamber and it appears that he is guilty of the crime.  Thus, the plot unravels at an alarming rate from this point on.  The  authors introduces us to all kinds of people, and red herrings and other  points of confusion abound.  It is left up to Sigismondo to solve the  mystery and to restore peace once more to the duchy.<br />  A man of mystery  himself, the muscular (and handsome) Sigismondo is also quite intelligent,  witty, and capable of taking care of himself in the martial arts (a true  'Renaissance Man').  He early on picks up Benno, a slow-witted ragamuffin,  as his assistant and servant.  Benno proves to be more than his appearance  allows, however.  The two, and Benno's dog Biondello, will appear in the  next Eyre novels.<br />  This book, while taking on some very recognizable  traits from another Renaissance mystery of \\"two houses divided,\\" is a  delight to read, no matter how familiar the plot.  The author (actually a  pseudonym of Jill Staynes and Margaret Storey) seems well versed in the  period and there is no problem of verisimilitude!<br />The storyline moves  quickly and the characters are convincing.

Macbeth, the local constable, is proud of the fact  that he is not an ambitious soul. Despite the fact that he has solved  thirteen previous murders, he is still a constable.  He refuses to be  promoted as he claims he is too happy in Lochdubh to want to advance to a  larger city.  He is filled with lots of common sense and while often the  villagers give him a hard time (\\"He's too lazy,\\" they claim.), they highly  respet him and have come to his rescue more than once.<br />  He's not  so lucky with his own love life, however, and seems to fall in love with  any woman who shows interest.

Her books  were never much of a success, but this one was picked up by the BBC.  She  is delighted that at long last, fame is coming her way.  She is so  overjoyed that she fails to retain the complete rights to her book; a  screen writer is hired to \\"modernize\\" the plot and characters (in other  words, to add lots of sex and violence to the rather staid Victorian tale).  Disagreements among the TV crew members erupt and, viola, the screenwriter  (an impossible sort, unliked and unloved by anybody, and quite impossible  to work with) is found dead; shortly thereafter, the star of the film (who  is to appear nude in some scenes) is killed when she  \\"falls\\" off a  boulder; her alcoholic husband has also been found dead!

The Macbeth series is a Formula One  ride--little will surprise the devout.  However, that said, Beaton treats  us once again to what we have come to expect from her and Macbeth, the  local constable from the Scottish Highlands village of Lochdubh.  (It is in  this book that we learn that it is pronounced \\"Lock doo\\"!)<br />Basically, we  find Macbeth once again tending his hens and sheep and lazing about; a  newcomer is introduced to us and shortly thereafter is found dead, with  \\"all the usual suspects\\"!  Of course, \\"red herrings\\" is Beaton's middle  name and the reader has to contend with them for the most part.  But no  matter, once again we are reminded of \\"the formula\\" and tolerate these  additives.<br />While certainly a fan myself, this edition, however, I found,  showed us that Ms Beaton was a bit out of her element.  In \\"Addict,\\" she  and Macbeth undertake the world of the drug barons and lords and street  dealers.  Ms Beaton seems out of her element here, as her solutions are way  too simplistic and she would have us think that this world is not any more  wicked or problematic than her own local community murders (usually  committed out of jealousy over some petty quarrel).  The drug world is  different, more complicated, and quite likely far more evil than any of the  other crime settings. The usual Beaton solution is not  convincing.<br />Hamish, of course, solves the situation, meets another woman  he falls in love with (it never takes him long), and by the end of the book  is once more alone.  His long time love, Priscilla Smythe-Burton, keeps  hanging about in all the books (Ms Beaton should \\"fish or cut bait\\" with  her, however.

And in  this novel, Vine departs from her \\"regular\\" thrillers and embarks on a  different route from what we've come to expect from her. Granted, Vine's  ability to capture her reader totally, as in her thrillers, is once again  to the fore.  In this book, famed writer Gerald Candless  early on suffers  a fatal heart attack and one of his daughters, Sarah, is persuaded to write  a biography, a memoir of what it was like to be the daughter of such a  famous writer.  Thus begins the odyssey:  she quickly discovers that  Candless is not her father's real name.  And what she unearths is at once  chilling, emotionally trying, sentimental, and tragic.  Sarah is in for a  long haul.  And Vine is at her best as she lays bear the souls of her  principle characters. Perhaps what keeps the book alive--and the reader so  absorbed--is Vine's penchant for capturing her audience completely.  And  while \\"Chimney's Sweeper's Boy\\" is not a Rendell-mystery, complete with  police procedural revelations, it is a book that is compelling, almost  impossible to put down.  That is the beauty of the work, the genius of  Vine's writing ability.  Vine scores easily in this scholarly,  sophisticated, yet readable, missive.  The characters, in addition to  Sarah, are complete and believable.  Early on, Candless and his Girls play  The Game, an esoteric, snobbish parlor contest.  No rules are explained but  the object is for the players to pass a scissors a certain way and to be  able to explain the move, thus the \\"solution\\" to the riddle.  Few solve it  and Candless and company make buffoons of their guests (which is basically  why they play it), belittling them for their inability to solve The Game.  This turns out to be a metaphor for his own life and for Vine's intricately  written and cleverly presented work. One of Vine's chief characteristics is  the pace she applies to her works.  There is never a doubt whether the  author is in control of the plot development, her characters, or any other  literary aspect.  Nothing goes awry as she orchestrates the book's  denouement and the reader's reactions.  It is a treat to see such writing  and to see such a writer display her command of her prose.  In the  Inspector Wexford novels, Rendell is content to stay within the bounds of  police investigation and solution--and feels quite comfortable in doing  so--and has created one of the best of current British mysteries, but when  she lets loose her writing psyche as Vine, watch out!

Anna Apostolou takes us down History Lane in yet another of Paul Doherty's time-line mysteries, \\"A Murder in Macedon.\\"  And while Doherty's English historical mysteries are exciting, and informative, reading, Apostolou  takes the Oliver Stone approach to revealing the vagaries of the past.  (Apostolou is one of Doherty's pseudonyms.)  It seems to be Stone's premise  that \\"if you thought the real history was exciting, wait until you see how  I dress it up.\\"  And much the same way, Apostolou takes us back to the time  of Alexander the Great of Macedon. We find Alexander, troubled,  quick-to-temper, and eager to be king in his own right, having to deal with  the assassination of his father, Phillip, the Macedonian king.  Between his  own irreverences with his father and the plottings of his mother Olympias,  whom Phillip has recently divorced in favor of a younger, more beautiful  princess, there is reason for Alexander to feel that everyone will believe  that he was involved in the assassination of his father.  Apostolou  introduces us to Hebrew twins Miriam and Simeon, both of whom Alexander  trusts.  Young Alexander is barely 20 and naturally, at first, fears his  own life in the aftermath of the regicide.  Indeed, as Shakespeare's  Henry  V said, \\"Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.\\" His friends come to his  rescue.  Apostolou introduces us to a number of plots, all plausible, of  course.  And it is at the hands of Miriam and Simeon that, ultimately, the  \\"truth\\" is revealed.  Basically, the story is exciting reading; however,  historical scholars won't be quick to embrace the theories offered.  For  instance, Apostolou directly involves Demosthenes in the assassination.  Demosthenes, the great Athenian orator, did oppose Phillip's rule--and  plans--for the conquered Athens and ultimately was exiled when Alexander  later took over; however, no proof exists that he arranged for Phillip's  death.  And while, perhaps, it makes for intriguing reading, I have  problems with fictional writers taking such liberties!  Apostolou does cite  her sources, to give the author some credit, of course. And, of course, the  spellings of the names may alter, owing to different translators' versions.  History should not be altered, or even managed, just to create an exciting  story, however! Otherwise, happy reading.  The story moves well and the  author's presentation of the characters seems adequate in keeping with the  whole intrigue.  In fact, Alexander's portrayal seems partly in keeping  with history.  And, after all, when it comes to interpretation of character  based upon historical research, Apostolou's opinion has to be a credible as  anyone else's.  There is the sequel, of course, as Apostolou concludes this  novel without dispensing of Olympias, the quintessential \\"plotter and  schemer.\\" Some historians claim that Alexander later had her executed for  her involvement in this, and other, nefarious acts.  (She does not seem to  be a person one would love to meet.)  We'll have to wait to see how  Apostolou takes care of her! This book ends, too, just as Alexander is  getting ready to start his campaigns to conquer the known world.

It's a pilgrimage you won't want to miss!  P.C. Doherty adds one more pilgrim's tale in \\"Ghostly Murders\\" to the three previously published and in this series the author definitely makes the literary journey worthwhile.  Doherty's entourage is the same 31  that  Geoffrey Chaucer assembled  in Southwark in London in \\"The Canterbury Tales\\" who are on their  pilgrimage to pay respects to the martyred St. Thomas a Becket at his  shrine in Canterbury in 1389.  From one's own British literature knowledge,  the reader knows that each member is required to tell four tales, two going  and two returning.  In this series of mysteries, Doherty portrays the  travelers much as Chaucer originally did and it is amusing reading to  discover how he weaves Chaucer into this modern day re-telling.  Of course,  Chaucer died before all 124 tales could be \\"told,\\" and so perhaps this is  Doherty's way of completing the series.  Doherty does not write in rhyming  couplets and his narrative prose moves much more quickly; after all,  Chaucer set out to tell his tales and each was required to possess a moral.  Doherty doesn't seem quite so obsessed.  A fifth tale by Doherty, however,  has not appeared. In \\"Ghostly Murders\\" (\\"The Poor Priest's tale of mystery  and murder as he goes on pilgrimage from London to Canterbury\\"), the author  features Father Philip, who, along with his brother Edmund, has just been  assigned his first parish in the village of Scawsby in Kent.  That village  has held a long, and evil, mystery dealing with the Knights Templars, a  holy relic, rumors of lost treasure, evil incarnate, and, of course, a  murder or two.  By the end of the book, Father Philip \\"had learned a great  deal, in his short stay at Scawsby, about good and evil, about the human  will and the need to repair what was broken, for man to answer for what he  did.\\"  This is quite an interesting series.  Doherty writes under other  names as well: Michael Clynes, Paul Harding, Anna Apostolou, to name three.

Signs have been spray painted around town that \\"Benny's Back\\" and that also  unnerves the locals, especially those with young children themselves. Benny  Lightfoot was the chief suspect those years ago but because Dalziel didn't  really believe he was guilty, let him go, and then he disappeared.

In \\"Beulah,\\" however, so many references  are made to \\"Pictures\\" that it helps if one has read that one as well.  Allusions to previous Dalziel/Pascoe investigations are there, which can be  a pain for readers who may have decided to pick this book for its own merit  (Martha Grimes is also quite guilty of this, as well).<br /><br />Hill's prose  remains the same, and he seems determined to make us think he has a bigger  vocabulary than P.D.

He also includes  \\"pendentious\\" but my Webster doesn't carry that one:  perhaps it's a  Yorkshire term.

THE GALLOWS MURDERS by Michael Clynes  \\"The Gallows Murders\\" by Michael Clynes is described as \\"being the fifth journal of Sir Roger Shallot concerning certain wicked conspiracies and horrible murders  perpetuated in the reign of King Henry VIII.\\"  And this fifth episode comes  as no disappointment to Clynes' readers as his champion, Shallot, rides to  the fore and before you can say \\"Bob's your uncle,\\" the 16th century puzzle  is solved!  An interesting character, Shallot describes himself :  \\"I  am not a coward.  I just run very fast.  I am also not a fool,\\" who lives  by his favorite maxim:  \\"He who fights and runs away may get out of  fighting on another day.\\" And author Clynes makes him the ultimate hero of  Tudor England (among his boasts:  being special adviser to King Henry VIII  and Cardinal Wolsey, confidant of Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, and  lover of Elizabeth I and the father of their \\"love child.\\"  He also claims  \\"ownership\\" to several of Shakespeare's best lines.  The Bard, Shallot, and  Kit Marlowe are all drinking and wenching buddies! (An original fairy  tale!)  Whatever.  What Clynes does, however, is weave a yarn that is  entertaining at best; however, the author is quite an authority on medieval  England and his expertise is readily apparent in his descriptions of the  period.  While his concoctions may be historically far-fetched (and far  from actuality!), still, his \\"accounts\\" offer a literary intrigue (if not a  \\"gossipy account\\" of the times!) and an enjoyable tale!  In this  episode, Shallot finds himself involved in another of Henry's  misadventures. The Great Mouldwarp of Merlin's prophecies is ever so  insecure about his own kingship and now messages arrive signed and sealed  by King Edward V (one of the little \\"princes of the Tower\\" of Richard III  fame), demanding that Henry pay extortion fees.

A series of violent murders has gripped Memphis tightly and this capital city on the Nile finds that terror has unleashed its fury on the citizens in the form of The Devourer.  Sent, the people fear, by the gods because of their own dissatisfaction of  the mortals in this sacred kingdom, the retribution is dispersed without  pity and the victims are left horribly disfigured.  Their hearts have been  slashed from their bodies and a white feather is left in their stead.  Clearly the goddess Ammut the Devouress, the Eater of Souls, has come for  vengeance. In Lynda S. Robinson's fourth installment of her highly  successful Lord Meren series, readers are treated to great suspense when  intrigue, politics, and Lord Meren's own personal life come into play in  \\"Eater of Souls.\\" The young pharaoh, King Tutankhamun has been on the  throne for only a short time.  In \\"Eater of Souls\\" the boy king displays  wisdom far above the average 14-year-old and Robinson easily weaves this  \\"wunderkind\\" into her novels as a believable character.  In addition,  she  establishes the strong relationship so important to Meren (his title is the  Eyes and Ears of Pharaoh), whose responsibility is to make certain that the  pharaoh is protected under all circumstances, a chief of security, as it  happens.  He is also one of the king's most trusted and loyal supporters.  As any student of Egyptian history knows, of course, Tut's short-lived  reign was not without despair, which lends credence to Robinson's plots,  intrigues, and  sinister behind-the-back assassinations, real and  figurative.  Through this series the reader, naturally, is waiting for the  inevitable, but Robinson has created such believable characters that the  fiction overrides the reality.  For centuries, the answers to what really  happened to this dynasty has eluded us, although some very real--and very  twentieth century--theories abound and the author is able cleverly to play  on this.  Her books include enough verisimilitude that serious  Egyptologists can find her plots imaginable, believable, plausible.  Dr.  Robinson seems to know her Egypt, thus making the venture into this part of  history, albeit a fictionalized one, an exciting ride.  The Nile has never  been so blue, yet never so complex.

MacDonald introduced his hero, Travis McGee in \\"The Deep Blue Good-by\\" in 1964, readers have looked forward to the next episode of this hero of hue--each McGee title contains a color--and the man Time  magazine calls \\"a knight in tarnished armor.\\" In \\"The Empty Copper Sea,\\" we  find Travis once again setting sail to right the wrongs of the oppressed,  the downtrodden, the underdog in this, the 17th of the series. In this  installment, we find the usual assortment of suspects, friends and other  unique characters and it is up to Travis and friend Meyer to sort  everything out. Hub Lawless is reported to have drowned after falling  overboard at sea, but no one seems to believe this, especially the  insurance company responsible for a $2 million policy payment and certainly  not Travis McGee, whose good friend Van Harder is held responsible for  Lawless' death. And Trav is not one to see his friends wronged. And wronged  Harder is, especially when we discover an anonymously sent photograph of  Lawless sipping beer somewhere in Mexico. Something is rotten in that  state, as well! The plot and characters enter a convoluted trail,  nevertheless, but MacDonald is a master at keeping everything in order and  as the plot is revealed sense is made of all the comings and goings. The  New Yorker has called MacDonald's books a \\"satisfying mixture of gentle sex  and bloody violence\\" and \\"Empty Copper Sea\\" is no exception. MacDonald does  not hold back on his violence (remember, he also wrote \\"Cape Fear\\"!) and  the book cruises on course to its violent--and surprising--climax. It is  the interplay between Travis and Meyer that makes the book more than just  an action novel: Meyer, the renown economist, intellectual, and Travis's  alter ego, and McGee, the Don Quixote of Ft. Lauderdamndale, working out of  Slip F-18 in Bahia Mar aboard his houseboat \\"The Busted Flush.\\" The McGee  books have sold millions and continue to hold their own in bookshelves  today, a fitting tribute to MacDonald's ability to capture themes,  characters, and plots for all time. A number of attempts has been made to  film McGee (the last was a dreadful version of \\"Empty Copper Sea\\" with an  equally dreadful Sam Elliott as Travis, who just couldn't capture the  essence of MacDonald's McGee, no matter how hard he tried!) but so far,  these attempts have fallen short.

MacDonald's 20th Travis McGee book &quot;Cinnamon Skin&quot; reads as well today as it did when published in 1982.  It is one of the very few books I have ever re-read and it was refreshing to find that it is just as  exciting, just as relevant today as it was when I first read it. In  &quot;Cinnamon Skin,&quot; we find Meyer's newly-wed niece Norma and her  husband being murdered aboard Meyer's boat &quot;The John Maynard  Keynes&quot;--and, of course, the circumstances are suspicious.  Was the  explosion at sea revenge for a drug deal gone wrong?  Did it have something  to do with Meyer's own past  (after all, he'd been in Chile a few years  earlier)?  Regardless, it is greatly disturbing to Meyer who enlists his  friend Travis to help.  Meyer's loss is Travis',  after all, Travis is  rough and tough but philosophic,and the ensuing McGee adventure takes the  two on a convulted odyssey from Ft. Lauderdale to Texas to Mexico.  MacDonald holds us spellbound with his plot revelations, but he is also a  master at capturing the local color (especially noteworthy here is his  interesting &quot;history&quot; of Cancun), and of sparking his suspense  with daubs of humor. MacDonald's works frequently touch on socially  significant issues, such as the environment, and especially on the damages  that developers have been plying on the Florida coast, from shabby  construction to irresponsible waste disposal.  He likes to remind us that  we are, after all, in the 20th century.  &quot;Soon the bosses of the  microcomputer revolution will sell us preprogrammed units for each  household which (will provide for everything).  It will be the biggest  revolution of all, bigger than the wheel, bigger than Franklin's kite,  bigger than paper towels.&quot; In his many books, sometimes MacDonald  seems to assume the role of Cassandra outside the gates of Thebes, crying  out his revelations and prophesies, yet he is doomed not to be believed.  Tis a pity. &quot;Cinnamon Skin&quot; carries, brilliantly, the  MacDonald/McGee mystique, and while the series is over thirty years old,  the colors in the titles have not faded; Travis is as relevant today as he  has always been.  MacDonald's prose--if nothing else-- will transport the  reader on a magical, mystical,  enthusiastic ride, well worth the fare.

For lovers of historical mysteries, Janet Laurence's &quot;Canaletto and the Case of the Westminster Bridge&quot; will be a welcomed addition.  For readers who are looking for intriguing suspense, intense plots, clever  developments, thought-provoking incidents, and multi-dimensional  characters, then this book may be a disappointment. Laurence introduces us  to Canaletto, the famed Venetian artist of the eighteenth century, who  arrives in England with his personal fortune (he's been told that it is the  correct time to make a &quot;killing&quot; (as it were!) by directly  investing in English ventures) and his desire to &quot;paint&quot; London.  Upon his arrival at the docks, he is nearly killed by a ruffian.  Enter  Fanny Rooker, who just happens to be meeting the boat.  She saves his life  twice early on in this book.  Fanny is a rather nondescript young woman who  has troubles of her own; she is an aspiring artist and is  &quot;framed&quot; on a trumped up charge of theft. The two &quot;down and  outers&quot; form a team that provides Laurence with her problem solving  modus operandi.  (Laurence does not permit this relationship to develop  into anything romantic, although apparently Canaletto in reality was indeed  quite the lady's man, the author hints.)  Thus the plot thickens and we  find Canaletto, basically, sans fortune and unlikely to find any painting  commissions.  His woes continue, but William Pitt gives him an offer the  Italian cannot refuse--to help Pitt and the English government uncover the  fraud that is keeping the newly commissioned Westminster Bridge from being  completed, at least on time.  Canaletto is instructed to leave no stone  unturned in investigating the problems that have arisen from the quarry  that provides the material for the bridge.  He canvasses closely the usual  suspects and with his keen eyes and excellent perspective, solves the case  and, well, you get the &quot;picture.&quot; Laurence does a very good job  of providing us with a good sense of eighteenth century London.

Reginald Hill then precedes in his opening chapter of &quot;Pictures of Perfection&quot; to capture  completely the reader's undivided attention in this yet another Dalziel and  Pascoe British mystery. However, while irony may be a useful, sometimes  even necessary, literary tool, Hill incorporates another device and carries  it a step  further--he approaches the &quot;theatre of the absurd.&quot;  While using this mesmerizing first chapter to rivet the reader's attention  solidly, longtime--and quite successful--writer Hill cheapens his shots by  ultimately relying on another literary device, the red herring!  And this  red herring is also a very smelly dead horse, to carry the metaphor even  further!  By the concluding chapter, the reader, at least one hoping for  more than just a &quot;high rush&quot; (or catharsis) of satisfaction of  discovering that &quot;all's well that ends well,&quot; is the victim of a  low blow. It seems that Hill simply becomes too involved-- in apparently  something else besides the book-- to afford a sensible, and usual, Hill  ending.  Thus, this reader is left with a feeling of disbelief in one of  his favorite authors!  In fact, it is almost an embarrassing conclusion!  Not that endings can't be simple, of course, but Hill doesn't seem to want  to present another of his provocative endings, one that stays with you.  This time, he perhaps thinks &quot;simple is best.&quot; Granted, the  reliable Dalziel and Pascoe are up to form.  Who cannot like this duo, and  the reliable Sergeant Wield is once again featured, for better or for  worse!  Hill has no difficulty in keeping the readers' interests as his  writing style generally holds true to form.  The remaining characters step  up to carry the plot and his humor is still intact.  And, once again, he  cleverly weaves in the most interesting literary allusions which make his  books always a great challenge to try to stay up with him.  The best line  in the book is offered:  &quot;He wore...a shot-silk scarf just long enough  when he drove at speed to give him something of Isadora Duncan's panache  without risking sharing her fate.&quot; Hill's best books are &quot;Bones  and Silence&quot; (perhaps I treasure it  because it was the first one I  read), &quot;Recalled to Life,&quot; &quot;Child's Play,&quot; &quot;Dead  Heads,&quot; and &quot;Exit Lines.&quot;  No foolishness in these, that's  for certain.  And Hill's style is razor-sharp, perhaps to use a Hill  expression!  And his books--with a bit of poetic license--have made an  excellent British TV mini- series starring Warren Clarke as Dalziel and  Colin Buchanan as Pascoe. However, his style begins to get a bit weary as  he develops his &quot;Pictures.&quot;  He writes, &quot;Beneath this dark  escutcheon ran the equally obscure words 'Fuctata non perfecta.'&quot; This  motto is set to apply to the gentried Guillemard family, but easily  symbolizes the novel!  Hill's prose continues as he describes Wield:  &quot;Others often took it as a sign that the interrupted lycanthropic  process suggested by his face was about to be resumed.&quot;  And then,  &quot;Slowly, he began a circumambulation of the motorcycle.&quot; Not to  be outdone, he writes, &quot;The rejected convoy was moving off in an  accelerando of engines and a brume of fume&quot; and continues with  &quot;Only one word in this mulitfarious menu really registsered on the  biker's brain&quot; and &quot;he placed the coins carefully on a ziggurat  of copper and silver.&quot; But what's in a name, someone once asked, and  Hill continues to bombard us with &quot;but was inhibited by his own  dishabille&quot; and scores the  coup de grace with &quot;It was a coup de  foudre, a surge of longing so intense, he felt as if every ounce of his  flesh was on fire.&quot;  And, finally, &quot;Here was the still center of  the Scudamore household, its domestic and commercial strength and its  tutelary spirit.&quot;  Please, Reginald! `cudamore household, its domestic and commercial strength and its  tutelary spirit.&quot;  Please, Reginald! `	1999-02-18

And probably this is an apt word to describe all the Hamish Macbeth books by British sleuth writer M.C. Beaton (who also  writes the popular Agatha Raisin series).  Beaton's Macbeth books (all  beginning with &quot;Death of a ...&quot;) takes us to the Scottish  Highlands and the village of Lochdubh.  Hamish is a low-keyed police  constable who'd rather be out poaching salmon or chasing the odd deer than  tending to his constabulary duties; in fact, most of the townspeople  consider him a bit lazy and unmotivated.  He refuses to work toward  promotion within the police department and often lets his superiors take  credit for his solutions, which are always the correct ones by the books'  endings..  No matter.  Hamish is happy.  He loves the Highlands, his dog  Towser, and small town life (and here we are talking of VERY small town  life!); however, even small towns fall prey to murderers and, as it has  been in all the Macbeth stories, it is the constable's slow, plodding--but  accurate--detective work that brings the murderer to justice. Beaton's  works are not like the complex books of P.D. James or the skilled  stylistics of Ruth Rendell or the literary awareness of Martha Grimes (all  tremendous writers themselves), but they are worth reading.  She captures,  indeed, an essence of Scotland rarely seen since that earlier Macbeth, in  thunder, lightning, and rain, managed to flood the stage with all those  bodies a few centuries ago!).  Beaton  manages to incorporate just enough  romance into her stories so that readers find themselves genuinely  interested in whether Hamish will EVER be able to settle down and marry  Priscilla,  a high-born lassie with a mind of her own and who often as not  assists in the investigations. Beaton, too, is able to add touches of wry  humor here and there, and, granted, after getting into the series, the  reader is generally able to predict much of the action.  Still, this is a  series that is a delight and shouldn't be missed.  The Brits have begun  filming a Hamish Macbeth series, which should hit the PBS circuit, too, we  hope!f the action.

Reality lurks behind every  page, it seems, of a Donna Leon novel, from the cold, creaking listings of  ages-old buildings almost atop the famed canals to the musty, bone-chilling  foggy days as the &quot;high waters&quot; begin to permeate the once Serene  Republic's confines.  And, of course, thre's a murder or two lurking around  some hidden corner of some fourteenth-century palazzo and naturally, as in  the other works, it is Brunetti's dedication, his loyalty, and above all  else his honesty in seeking out the truth that eventually bring about the  solution.  Leon's conclusions, however, are not always the easiest, most  convenient, or happiest, as she gallops away from the melodramatic and lets  reality win again.  She underscores the fact that there are evil people  about and, yes, occasionally,  they win. Sometimes, by the end of her  books, not all the guilty are punished, but the cases are solved,  nonetheless.  To say Venice, or even Italy itself, is any more corrupt than  any other place is not the question, but Leon, herself an American English  teacher at the University of Maryland extension campus at the U.S. Army's  Vicenza (Italy) post, has spent quite a number of years in Italy, speaks  the language, and captures the nuances of the people and of their daily  lives, it seems; indeed, quite an accomplishment for an outsider. &quot;You  don't want to keep Doctor Semenzato's appointment.&quot;  With this  warning, two men proceed to beat Brett Lynch within an inch of her life.  Thus, the action really begins in this fast-paced book.  We'd met Brett in  the previous Leon book.  Brett is a famed anthropologist (NOT an architect  as the writer in a preceding  review asserts) and is the lover of noted  Italian soprano Flavia Petrelli; she is involved in an extensive dig in  China where she has helped uncover a priceless &quot;find.&quot;  Enter the  art thieves, murderers, and con men. Indeed, from this point, murder and  mayhem do follow and Commissario Brunetti is quick to pick up the case,  indeed, he is eager for it.  For in the previous case, Flavia and Brett had  both been chief suspects in the case.  Since then, Guido has come to  respect them both and, to some extent, even considers them friends.  He is  appalled at the brutality of the assault and fears for Brett's life.  In  the course of this investigation, more than one murder transpires, with  art-world theft as the circulating theme. What has &quot;high water&quot;  (Acqua Alta) to do with the book?  Acqua alta is the dread of every  Venezian, as climatic changes cause the water in the canals to rise above  their normal levels and a city ordinarily accustomed to much water  anyway  finds itself literally being inundated by even more of it!  Thus, like  Sandburg's fog in  Chicago, the water becomes another character, always  looming, always rising, always threatening.  But unlike Sandburg's fog, it  doesn't creep in on little cat's feet.  And it comes not to wash away the  sins but to underscore them.  The end comes with the usual &quot;bang&quot;  and Brunetti is left to ponder the aftermath.  His path of glory indeed  leads but to the grave for his villains, as Thomas Gray might have written  in his &quot;Elegy.&quot; (Leon has pubished her latest--and  seventh--Brunetti novel, &quot;A Noble Radiance&quot; which is not yet  available in the States.

And, yes, Superintendent Richard Jury of Scotland Yard hops on one of the red doubled deckers and rides Bus No. 14 down the Fulham Road toward Fulham  Palace.  (Bus No. 14 is easy to find--you can pick it up in front of  Harrods!)  Indeed, in this book, you are in for a ride! Martha Grimes once  again evokes the landscape and atmosphere of London in yet another of her  intriguing mysteries named after an actual pub in England.  Once again she  compels her readers (in this the 15th in the series) to stay to the very  end with prose that is finely diced and clearly applied--and delightful to  read. Grimes has a particular knack in evoking a profusion of literary  allusions and of creating characters that hold one's attention, fully. In  &quot;Stargazey,&quot; Grimes indeed continues to lead us with her array of  memorable characters as she tweaks and twitches the very nub of British  life--or at least the life of the well-to-do.  And she manages this coup,  customary that it is with Grimes, with a sense of humor that borders on the  unexpected.  This American author spends time, obviously, in the UK for her  research and she knows the country (and countryside) well; she espouses the  vernacular like a native! One important issue, however, is that if you are  a new reader of Grimes, keeping the characters straight and not being able  to understand references to earlier escapades/cases must be confusing.  It  is essential that readers begin with earlier Grimes books for the full  impact of this one; however, it is still worth the read! (Lastly, don't  look for the Stargazey pub anymore.  About three months before the book was  published, new owners/managers took over and changed the name.  The pub's  still there, but it's not the Stargazey.  And the decor has been changed as  well.  Tis a pity.  But the bus ride is well worth the effort, and, if  nothing else, get back off the bus and try the tea at Harrods.  Now THAT'S  worth a trip to England!)arrods.

Peter Carey, the Booker Prize winner of &quot;Oscar and Lucinda,&quot;  brings Jack Maggs to life and in  this new novel of the same name, he  combines a fresh 20th century style with Victorian atmosphere and  resurrects &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and Charles Dickens at the same  time!  And perhaps to the relief of thousands of school children who have  had to read the original!<br />Carey's Mr. Maggs bears the responsibility of  being the protagonist and we meet the former Convict knocking on the door  of an earlier acquaintance (whom we will come to know later in the novel)  in London.  Maggs, as you will remember, was sentenced to life exile in  Australia (it was really &quot;down under&quot; then!) when we last heard  of him in &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; We know from that novel that, via  Dickensian and Victorian melodrama and coincidence, he has shaken his  chains of bondage and become a wealthy (and worthy!) citizen of the Colony,  one who, struck by Pip's kindness in an earlier day, sets the young boy up  anonymously to become a &quot;gentleman&quot; in London society.  Now,  Maggs has dared to return to England (under penalty of death....) to  &quot;meet my boy,&quot; as he says.  Mr. Phipps, Carey has determined, has  really led the life of a gentleman; however, he is not so eager to meet his  benefactor, fearing, for one, that all this &quot;life of leisure&quot;  might be taken away from him!  It may come as a surprise that Mr. Phipps  appears so ungrateful.  Thus, the tragedy begins.<br />The author introduces  us to the &quot;newly-found&quot; technique of hypnotism and we are given  an insight into Maggs through this venue, to discover his fears, his  Phantom, and to learn the real man, tragic as it seems.  Maggs has had to  endure the horrifying experiences of being a convict in the British penal  colony and through his hypnotism we see these torturous moments and come to  understand Maggs the man.  Indeed, he is the product of his environment and  we meet some real Dickens characters here. Carey pays homage to  Dickens--and we see this readily--in a kinder, gentler manner than one  first perceives.<br />Publishers Weekly has called this book  &quot;irresistible&quot; and that descriptive aptly applies.t and  we meet some real Dickens characters here.

Doherty brings to life once more  Hugh Corbett, accomplished  clerk and spy of King Edward I of England.  Doherty, who is an Oxford graduate and history scholar, is a popular author  writing under other names as well and he is able to bring the 14th century  literally to life in an intriguing series that weaves logic, realism, and  romanticism with  medieval European thoughts and actions.  Indeed, Doherty  really does lay bare some of the romantic concepts we're used to, in not  only this book, but the others as well.  Thus, it is Hugh Corbett's  responsibility to save the King once more in this ninth accounting.<br />The  year is 1303 and Edward's nemesis, Philip IV of France, continues to  threaten the very essence of Edward's kingship.  This time, Edward arrives  in York to begin a series of secret negotiations with the Knights Templar.  Following an attempt on his life, the King sends for Corbett and his  faithful servants Ranulf and Maltote (Ranulf has been promoted to  &quot;assistant&quot; by now).  From this point, the book picks up its  always-suspenseful form and the reader is carried to a satisfying,  intriguing end (what else?) in royal fashion.<br />The title comes from the  fact that the assassin in the book uses a mysterious fire to kill his  victims.  This fire seems &quot;unexplainable,&quot; but Corbett (whose  skills in logic seem to leap centuries!) is able to &quot;break the  code&quot; and solve the mystery, as one would expect.<br />Doherty's flair  for evoking the realistic images of the period is no accident, as he is an  accomplished historian who specializes in Edward I.  Doherty also writes  under the  noms de plume of Michael Clynnes, Anna Apostalou, C.L. Grace,  Edward Marston, among others.  Each &quot;name&quot; features a series with  exciting historical characters--none to be missed. An exciting read!	1998-09-03

Kaminsky has the  unique ability to write of modern day Russia with a &quot;feel&quot; that  is at once real and compelling.  The Curtain has fallen on the  political system of the Soviet Union and out of the depths of the ashes  rises not the Phoenix but a complex, confusing, and dangerous atmosphere  that indeed is alarming to its citizens, who, naturally, long for breaths  of freedom.  Who will rule out of this rubble is the mystery!  The  collapse of communism merely has opened up another evil--organized crime.  However, enter Inspector Rostnikov and his team of crime fighters of the  Moscow police..  Throughout the series, readers have come to respect  the wily, one-legged Inspector (known as &quot;The Washtub,&quot; due to  his weightlifting in his freetime), who is a realist at heart, yet both a  sentimentalist and a romanticist.  In &quot;The Dog Who Bit A  Policeman,&quot; Rostnikov's squad faces the destructive forces of two  Mafia gangs, hell- bent to kill each other and to control the country, one  precinct at a time.  Kaminsky's books always carry parallel campaigns and  Sasha Tkach and Elena  Timofeyeva are assigned to hound out the  perpetrators of illegal dog fighting, a fast rising and highly profitable  &quot;business.&quot; Elena's romantic interests with  Rostnikov's  policeman son continue to expand while the &quot;Vampire&quot; Emile  Karpo's task follows more the political line of crime fighting.  He and the  Inspector try to solve a series of gang-related murders but which also  involve high level political figures.  Kaminsky has the ability to  invoke the power of description and episode of modern Moscow and of the  feelings of the general Muscovite. One doesn't have to know first-hand  Mother  Russia to appreciate this series as the author's ability to bring  out the landscape and atmosphere is outstanding and noteworthy.
