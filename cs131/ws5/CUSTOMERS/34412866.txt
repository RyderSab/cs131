I was looking forward to reading her latest release about Evie Garlick (isn't that a cute name) a transplanted American in London.<br /><br />Eighteen year old Evie is an aspiring actress who leaves her parents and mild-mannered boyfriend Jonny in Ohio to take an advanced acting class. She was only supposed to stay a few months.<br /><br />Innocence is narrated from Evie's perspective. The first thing she has to say is her friend Robbie is dead, killed in a horrible car meets body disaster. After this awkward announcement the successive chapters flip back and forth between Evie's first appearance in London and fifteen years later.<br /><br />Evie stays at a boarding home for actors when she first lands. Here's where she meets Robbie who's real name is Alice. Robbie quickly renames Evie, Raven; her stage name and sets the tone for these two characters' relationship. Fifteen years later Evie's living in another group home with new roommates and not much has changed except she doesn't have a boyfriend, she isn't acting and she has a son.<br /><br />In her first life she's into sex, drugs, rock & roll and Jake and his guitar. Her whole purpose for coming to London melts away as does her ability to speak for herself. Then she gets pregnant. In her second life she's into night classes, Alex (her son) and not allowing herself to have fun, a job promotion or a sex life.<br /><br />Around page one hundred her dead friend (who's been gone five years) begins to visit her at work, home and out on the street for no real purpose but to embarrass and berate her.<br /><br />As you've probably figured out I wasn't impressed with this story. Where Elegance was full of one laugh after another, Innocence is seriously lacking. Some of the language doesn't flow right and requires rereading to get the author's message; slowing down the flow. Even the Shakespeare interludes were a hindrance. If I wanted to read Shakespeare I'd grab my Norton Anthology.<br /><br />Tessaro does have a penchant for creating interesting characters, like the morose, drug addicted rock-and-roll-want-a-be lover of Evie's and her land lady elderly widow, Bunny Gold who is part landlady and part grandmother to her current residents. But they are not enough to keep interest alive.<br /><br />My expectations were really high for the release of this novel. I wasn't expecting a cookie cut out of her first release but I was expecting the same calibre of story, tartness and intensity. Maybe it was the opening line, I'm not sure; but it hung with me for the first half of the book and when Robbie came back from the dead to lead Evie to salvation I just rolled my eyes. I'd definitely put my nickels and dimes elsewhere. Review written by M. E. Wood for [...]indrance.

Her father, Jack, is a successful accountant and her mother, Abby, is a dental hygienist. Sara dreams of being a psychiatrist. She's a braniac at school and her proud parents are ecstatic she is bound for Harvard.<br /><br />But they didn't count on her meeting and falling head-over-heels in love with pseudo bad boy Danny Slade. Danny listens to her. She can see it in his green eyes and when he touches her it's electric. Within a short period of time Sara goes from studious to sneaking out of the house at night to be with Danny.<br /><br />Sara becomes pregnant and Danny seems to fall off the face of the earth. She can't find him anywhere and no one will tell her where he is. Her parents find out about the pregnancy too late to do anything about it so they have no choice but to reluctantly see her through.<br /><br />Abby takes Sara to an adoption agency. Keeping the baby is not an option. Her parents won't allow her to ruin her life any further. Sara isn't so sure until the agency official explains 'open adoption' to her. She'd have complete access to the baby but there's one catch, it's only legal in Oregon.<br /><br />Against Abby's wishes Sara chooses open adoption and begins the exhaustive search for new parents. In walks Eva and George Rivers. They are different from all the others and when Sara meets them there's an instant chemistry both ways. She begins to spend almost every waking hour with them and \\"Eva and George acted delighted all the time to do the littlest thing for her.\\" Everything seemed to be going great.<br /><br />Five months after little Anne's birth Eva and George start to become possessive of their new baby, their home and their time. Sara's presence suffocates them and her interaction with Anne makes Eva jealous and they decide, \\"maybe an open adoption could be too open.\\"<br /><br />Events arise and suddenly charges and restraining orders are filed. Sara shows up one day to find an empty house. Eva and George are gone and so is Sara's baby. Once again people she loves have disappeared from her life.<br /><br />Girls In Trouble is Caroline Leavitt's eighth novel. It opens with Sara in labour in the back seat of her father's vehicle en route to the hospital. From the opening scene it doesn't let you go. Leavitt did an excellent job of catching the complexity of emotions during delivery; grabbing reader's attention and delivering them into the life of this teenager struggling for adulthood, love and security. And a relationship with the daughter she never considers a mistake.<br /><br />Initially perspectives travel from Sara to Eva to George and later Danny and Anne allowing us to learn more about the characters' motivation. The only people we never hear from are Jack and Abby which would be disappointing were it not for Sara's quiet observations of their angst for their little baby.<br /><br />The idea of open adoption sounds great but Leavitt opens other doors by exploring human nature and nurture. Humans can not possibly know how they are going to feel or react to a future event no matter how hard they try or believe. Sometimes the deepest primal instincts prevail.<br /><br />Many emotions course through Girls In Trouble: excitement, fear, happiness, love, forgiveness, acceptance, jealousy, and the all powerful anger. With her flowing dialogue and decorative prose, Leavitt draws readers into the life of two families forever connected by one blessed event. Birth. Girls In Trouble moves quickly, settling in the middle momentarily but picking back up until the end. You don't have to worry about boredom creeping in. It won't have time.

To read or hear about it you'd think it was the next big drama out of Hollywood starring Nicole Kidman: One woman against the criminal justice system. Regretfully, it's real life. This is the story of one woman whose life has affected all women without most of them even knowing it.<br />In 1986 Jane Doe was raped by a man who climbed up and broke in through her locked balcony. This man had committed the same crime against five other women in the neighbourhood. The crimes were never reported to the women in the area so they could take extra precautions to protect themselves. In fact to hear Jane tell it, she and the other women in her neighbourhood were used as bait. \\"The police did not issue a warning because of their belief that women would become hysterical and jeopardize the investigation.\\" It's hard to enjoy reading about something like this. As a woman, it's hard not to become emotional and angry with a system put in place to protect.<br />When she called the police for help she was interrogated, then taken to a hospital to be poked and prodded (did you know the majority of rape kit results are never used in trials?). Then interrogated again numerous times by different people about the rape. Each time having to relive the event.<br />There's so much behind the story but basically she and a small group of friends took it upon themselves to warn the community by putting up posters about the rapist. Jane Doe quickly became known as a -trouble maker- amongst the police involved with her case because she was not following their protocol. Shortly after the poster war her assailant was arrested and she was put on trial to convict him. She was put on trial. She was interrogated yet again by the police, prosecutors, and the media.<br />After a strenuous battle, she won the right to be present at her trial instead out of view in the hall. She won the right to watch her attacker being tried. Because of this she learned about the many secrets behind police investigations which violated her rights. After her degrading trial and treatment by the police, she somehow discovered the nerve to sue the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force.<br />Again she had to relive every aspect of her rape and prove she wasn't some hysterical, depressed feminist with a grudge against men.<br />The book is depressing, sure, but I was riveted by her treatment not only as a woman but as a human being. Men, women, lawyers, law enforcement put into question her motives. Surprisingly she was able to find a few people to build a support group. Many did not stay. She was in effect, alone. Her civil suit took eleven years. The stamina this woman must have had to go through this every day for eleven years. She had to wait to be proven right or wrong and have everyone look at her like she was a leper. She didn't have a choice. It was her life and she didn't want anyone else to go through the harassment she experienced.<br />This book is for any woman who has had to think twice about walking into a darkened parking lot, or talking to strangers, or hanging out with a couple of male friends. OK, basically every woman that exists and this books is also for the 3 out 4 men who wouldn't commit rape if they had the chance and could get away with it. This book is a tool against rape and against the system that supports it. The Story of Jane Doe really shows why - 90 percent of the women who are sexually assaulted still choose not to report\\".<br />Throughout you never know the identity of Jane Doe or the rapist. The names are blacked out of the numerous paper clippings included to show media standing. This book isn't just about Jane Doe's story. It educates readers on rape. For educational purposes and to help understand a system run by men, she goes into detail about how the degrees of rape are determined to be violent or non-violent, each carrying a different level of punishment. Because Jane Doe was not stabbed or cut, beator mutilated her rape was considered non-violent. Hello? The man held her down in her own bed, in the privacy of her own home and thrust his penis into her without her consent. Sounds violent to me.<br />The transcripts and journal entries are laced with drawings and sketches, some by Jane Doe and some by Shary Boyle. While some were obvious, others were over my head and made no sense whatsoever but I did get a kick out of the psychologist holding up an ink spot of a vagina.<br />There are two sides to every story as well as individual perspectives. Everyone thinks their side is the right one. Is Jane right? She does use documented data from court reports, news files etc. Her side is believable. I winced at the beginning of the book where a few chapters were written from the perspective of the officers involved in her case. In these chapters Jane Doe speaks from what she felt was their perspective. Obviously no one could know what they were thinking (and she admits to this) but these views actually give more insight into what Jane Doe was feeling by their presence and actions.<br />There were periods where I was lost or bored, like when she spieled on about what is and isn't feminism. Most importantly The Story of Jane Doe raises questions about our legal system, how rape is defined, how law enforcement is trained and how victims and convicts are treated. It shows how women can and should take charge of their lives after an attack.<br />Even though we don't know who she is, these are her words, her story, and after being repeatedly misquoted in the media and elsewhere Jane Doe is finally getting her say. You should pick up a copy and have a listen.  (...)t or mutilated her rape was considered non-violent. Hello?

Stella is an interesting character. Through the author's description and vivid attention to detail we learn about her idiosyncrasies, especially her extreme paranoia. She's obsessive compulsive and afraid to leave the safety of her apartment. So much so her boyfriend or sister do the grocery shopping and in a pinch she'll have lipstick delivered from the pharmacy via taxi.<br /><br />Stella lives with Ivan. A secretive, manipulative man who enjoys oranges and mind games for breakfast. She met him when he came to remove old gas pipes from her apartment. Part of her paranoia revolves around the distinct smell of gas she insist still lingers despite the impossibility.<br /><br />Other characters include Skye, her chain-smoking sister, George, the real love of her life (unfortunately he has four legs and purrs), and a host of nosy clients and neighbours.<br /><br />Tuesday begins with Ivan sporting a gold ID bracelet inscribed with a \\"True Love Forever\\" promise and initials. This little piece of jewellery becomes one of Stella's fixations for the next five days. It also becomes the catalyst for her to transform herself physically into what she thinks Ivan desires. A past love called Sophia.<br /><br />Her agoraphobia isn't obvious at first but becomes painfully so when she attempts to vacate the apartment only to collapse inches from freedom. This is one of the best scenes in the whole book because of Visman's strong attention to detail. I easily felt the anxiety Stella felt.<br /><br />Regretfully, the vividness doesn't provide enough movement through the first two-thirds of the novel. I was quite bored with all the talk of oranges for breakfast, the straightening of jars, folding towels and other seemingly insignificant details. At least until you realize how deep Stella's psychological dilemma is. In retrospect it is quite a sad tale. \\"Yellow\\" attempts to touch on thriller as the secrets of Ivan's past become uncovered, but it falls short and becomes confusing amidst Stella's drama.<br /><br />Did I like this book as a whole? No. Its slow return in and out of reality was not enough to keep this reader entertained. The premise that Stella isn't able to conquer her agoraphobia until she transforms herself into another person is disturbing. I dislike this message - and it all happens within five days.

Jacque's escape is unsuccessful and he ends up murdered. Before his death he manages to leave a cryptic message for his granddaughter Sophie Neveu, a cryptologist. She believes solving the message will lead her to her grandfather's murderer but what she learns will change her life forever. Regrettably the message includes the name of Robert Langton, a symbologist.<br /><br />Robert is called in by the police where he's led through the last moments of Jacques life until the beautiful Sophie appears saying she has a message for him. While she occupies the inspector Robert dials a number Sophie gave him which strangely goes to her personal email. Stranger still is the message she leaves him. He's the prime suspect in Jacques murder and she has a plan to get him out of the museum, past the police and through the embassy doors.<br /><br />Instead of taking the easy way out and hiding under the shield of diplomatic immunity Robert decides to help Sophie crack the secret message her grandfather left which in tern leads to another message and another. Each time giving them insight into her grandfather's secret life with the Priory of Sion a secret religious society which supposedly involved such members as Sir Issac Newton, Botticelli and most importantly the great artist Leonardo DaVinci. During their hunt for the truth they don't know who to trust or who to believe. All they have is one another.<br /><br />By the time I got around to reading this book most of the hype around The DaVinci Code had died down. This was a gift from my sister-in-law so not necessarily a book I would have bought myself.<br /><br />The characters were enjoyable, the story line was easy to follow and it was entertaining. There may be a few new concepts raised about the Grail and religion but really nothing strikingly new but then again it is a work of fiction and I didn't read it expecting to find some new revelation. I read it for the entertainment value, which it definitely has.<br /><br />I enjoyed working on the mini mysteries as Sophie and Robert followed the clues her grandfather left them. The search for these clues are what move the story along. The character interludes are like commercials some are good some are not. Brown's depiction of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals are believable and leave a lasting impression and spark curiosity for further research. I was also impressed with his portrayal of women.<br /><br />What I didn't like was the repetitiveness of some of the scenes. When Brown switched from one character's perspective to another he would repeat information given in the previous scene; as the story picked up momentum this lessened.<br /><br />Overall, I was entertained.

US	34412866	R18MK6JLBC0YZ4	1594630097	563745222	Fat Girl: A True Story	Books	3	3	5	N	N	effectively blunt in describing the suffering of one child	This is not the first autobiographical memoir written by Moore. -Never Eat Your Heart Out- was a mixture of personal history with food factoids. Except for a few pages on being a fat adult most of -Fat Girl- is about Moore's childhood. Low self esteem ruled her life because of her abusive mother and grandmother. Days that were suppose to be filled with laughter, friends and special moments, were filled with routine torments of pinching, hair pulling and name calling. All supposedly because she was her father's daughter. The only sense of well being young Julia experienced was when she ate.<br />It's important to note this book is titled 'Fat Girl' not 'Fat Girls'. This is the story of one fat girl and her struggle to find love and is not meant to be a representation of all fat girls. Although any abused child (fat or not) may find glimpses of their life within these pages. Moore insists, &quot;All I will do here is tell my story.&quot;<br />Moore divulges the history of fat amongst the people in her family but mostly her and her father. Many pages are dedicated to her father's love of food and their struggle with &quot;This will be the last. I'll eat no more,&quot; syndrome. It's obvious throughout that young Judith is searching for and aches for love. Which she never seems to find.<br />The first person account is depressing on so many levels. After the first chapter I debated about not reading any further. In fact, numerous times I thought about quitting. There is a lot of self loathing which becomes quickly unnerving. It's interesting, in a voyeuristic kind of way I guess.<br />Little Judith comes across as neurotic numerous times. When she lived with her grandmother she would sic the dog on the hens and watch them die with &quot;disorienting pleasure&quot;. She also committed two break-and-enters by the time she was 12 for the sole purpose of walking around the homes to look through their personal items and most importantly to eat their food. One moment you're thinking she needs therapy and then the next you're reading about her mother screaming and beating her.<br />I'm sure some will be concerned with further stereotyping of all fat people: they stink, they sweat heavily, and they can't control their eating. More of a concern for me was the negativity around menstruation appearing at various points throughout.<br />There's been so much negativity about our periods for decades I'd hate for some girl to read this and think anything other than positive thoughts about her menstruation. It's important for readers to know some of the things Moore says may relate to all fat people and some of the things she says are just for her. We are not all the same regardless of how similar. The content is definitely for an adult mind.<br />-Fat Girl- almost seems incomplete. While Moore briefly mentions marriage and children there is a whole area of her life that seems ignored in this rather short 196 page, memoir. For what there is, it is effectively blunt in describing the suffering of a young fat girl and while the purpose was not meant to be an inspiration, she did survive and go on to have a productive life. But for such a depressing read whose sole purpose seems to be to shock, I'm not moved to recommend someone put out $25 for it. Try the library first or wait for paper back.<br />Review Originally posted at [...]re thinking she needs therapy and then the next you're reading about her mother screaming and beating her. <br />I'm sure some will be concerned with further stereotyping of all fat people: they stink, they sweat heavily, and they can't control their eating.

Which confirms two things: it's important to women and there are still too many people not listening.<br />What started off as a zine, Fat!So? has been one of the bibles for fat acceptance for a number of years. It shows no sign of waning. Marilyn started the zine after her boyfriend said he was embarrassed by her weight and the insurance company said she was a liability. Anyone over 160 pounds can probably relate. From there, Fat!So? grew into a popular website community and equally popular book.<br />The majority of Fat!So? is divided into four anatomy lessons: The Butt, The Belly, The Chin and The Upper Arm. Within these lessons everything about women and the plus size body is discussed via the ABCs. We even get to see pictures of naked bellies, chins and bums.<br />Like most advocates of fat acceptance she wants people to \\"embrace the F-word.\\" The 3 letter word not the 4 letter one so \\"no one can use it against you ever again.\\" Previous surgeon general C. Everett Koop, his close relationship to the diet companies and a brief timeline of Prescription diet drugs for the last hundred years are discussed. She doesn't like him. She also addresses childhood obesity, how to educate teachers about fat prejudice and making exercise fun, not a punishment.<br />There's an awesome essay titled Fat Kills by Betty Rose Dudley. In it she discusses her experience of visiting a doctor for a cough only to have the doctor deter to the topic of weight loss. Every time. You can read the essay at the Fat! So? website. There are many other essays by women of volume. Without the contributors Marilyn Wann wouldn't have had a book. The insights and experiences of others is what makes Fat! So? so good. Readers are able to see bits of themselves in others as well as learn what other fat people have dealt with.<br />Another favourite section of mine is the -Yeah, Right!- area. If you ever wished you had a comeback for a snide comment directed toward you this area will give you lots of ideas. Skip to this section for an instant boost.<br />As for the negatives there weren't many. Since its printing in 1998, some of the links are now expired but that's to be expected. At times Wann came across as promoting weight gain which I don't think is any better than promoting weight loss. Also the similarities of phrenology (using callipers to measure bumps on the skull) and bariatric medicine (the study of obesity) was a bit tedious and hard to follow. Lastly she encourages fat sex but there is no mention of safe sex. Fat people need to be aware of safe sex too. Especially since the book isn't directed toward adults only. Direction to more information would have been a nice addition to this area.<br />Fat!So? isn't all about the seriousness of being fat, fat acceptance and standing up for ourselves. Wann likes to have a little fun and it shows in a few of her mock essays, bountiful women cartoons from various artists and other extra goodies that take you from reading to interactive play.<br />There are with two cut'n paste projects; 17 fun things to do with your bathroom scale and, my favourite, the Venus of Willendorf Paper Doll. Remember those little flip books you had as a kid? You would flip through the pages and the image would appear to be running or jumping. Well in the top right hand corner is the cover diva shaking her groove thing. It's adorable. I like surprises. It took me until page 49 before I even realized it.<br />Another gem, almost unnoticed at the bottom of every page in very small print is -154 Ways to be a fatso-; like fill your home with fat positive art or refuse to apologize for your size. It's like an added bonus mini book.<br />Although Fat!So? is not the exclusive bible for fat acceptance that it use to be, it's a good read and shows what women have been trying to say for years: Accept me as I am.

Remember those little flip books you had as a kid? You would flip through the pages and the image would appear to be running or jumping. Well in the top right hand corner is the cover diva shaking her groove thing. It's adorable. I like surprises. It took me until page 49 before I even realized it. <br />Another gem, almost unnoticed at the bottom of every page in very small print is -154 Ways to be a fatso-; like fill your home with fat positive art or refuse to apologize for your size. It's like an added bonus mini book. <br />Although Fat!So? is not the exclusive bible for fat acceptance that it use to be, it's a good read and shows what women have been trying to say for years: Accept me as I am.(...)	2005-07-30

Andrea gives new meaning to being in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br /><br />Andy comes from a prim and proper high society family and isn't exactly the jewel of her mother's eye. Don't get me wrong, Cissy loves her to pieces. She'd just love her more is she hadn't missed her coming out party. Didn't wear clothes from bargain stores, wasn't single and had a better job.<br /><br />Cissy is a socialite extraordinaire. Her full time job is volunteering for causes. Andy is one of those causes. Her main goal is to dress her up and find her a husband. Andy's been dating the bashful lawyer from the first book but that's not enough for mum. Especially since the neighbours have been filling Cissy in on the young lawyer's comings and goings. Unacceptable!<br /><br />Poor Andy just wishes her mother whom she affectionately calls \\"Attila the Mom\\" would stop making decisions for her but she keeps putting herself in a position to let her mother do just that. Besides she really likes the perks which usually means some kind of designer dress, purse and shoes.<br /><br />Like Blue Blood, the first chapter introduces a new main character. In this case it's the Martha Stewart wanna-be Marilee Mabry. She's getting set to go live with a new tv show, The Sweet Life with Marilee, only there's been one catastrophe after another; falling beams, poisonous spiders, ex-husbands and a cat fight just to name a few. What's a conceded, bossy, Id woman to do? Especially since she's fired yet another web designer.<br /><br />Cissy, who happens to be a loyal friend of Marilee, enlists Andy to take over the web design (actually, she tells Marilee Andy will do it then she tells Andy, Andy will do). Andy succumbs but only until after the premiere when Marilee will have time to look for a replacement.<br /><br />During the time leading up to the gala celebrating the new show, Andy is able to see Marilee's interaction with her staff, lover, socialites, viewers and her pseudo-suicidal teen daughter Kendall. Andy instantly forms an opinion and is anxious to have her job over with so she can get away from them all.<br /><br />Blue Blood's underlying focus was friendship and while The Good Girl's Guide to Murder still nestles with the bonds of friendship, the real connection here is mother-daughter relationships. There are good relationships and bad relationships and some in between. With this story we're able to witness the dynamics of three relationships: Andy and Cissy, Marilee and Kendall and a new neighbour of Cissy's, Dr. Taylor and Renata.<br /><br />If you read my BlueBlood review you probably know it made me a big fan of Susan McBride and that I fell in love with the characters. I was so excited when I received my copy of the The Good Girl's Guide to Murder. My excitement waned quickly. The story didn't move along at the same tempo as the first, by the end of chapter nine I was thinking \\"this is so slow\\". While Andy's and Cissy's relationship has its interesting moments I felt the focus on their relationship became tedious. Even though the book is from Andy's perspective her mother seemed to be doing the sleuthing. Cissy's character overpowered Andy's. It was bordering on A Dallas Socialite Mystery... with a lot less mystery.<br /><br />I knew there was going to be a murder but it took forever to get there. When it happened I thought, \\"Finally she's dead\\" and I really didn't care who killed her. McBride is an excellent character builder but this release was overpowered with character and missing the mystery. Of course once the murder happened things picked up. The ending came to an amicable conclusion tying up loose ends but leaving room for further story development. This book is complete in itself and is probably great if you're starting here. But you really don't get an idea of how good the characters and McBride are unless you read the first one. I'm hoping for better in the next Debutante Dropout Mystery instalment.t one.

According to the author Lisa Sarasohn, \\"this book is about valuing your body and yourself.\\" Lisa has twenty plus years experience as a yoga teacher, yoga therapist, bodyworker and health educator (some of you may recognize her from her articles Sage Woman or Yoga Journal). Although not explicitly mentioned, elements of yoga and chakra work are evident throughout.<br /><br />The Woman's Belly Book (WBB) addresses some common misconceptions about women's bellies: the fashion of firm abdomens, methods of restricting the belly, and the laziness associated with a fleshy stomach. If we're able to get past these fallacies we'd be able to connect with our bodies and with our true selves. Freeing ourselves involves some interaction on our part.<br /><br />Lisa insists \\"your physical health and your emotional well-being depend on your capacity to breathe deeply.\\" Because of this belief a large portion of WBB is devoted to teaching the reader breath awareness and control; especially deep abdominal breathing. While this section is useful information it does become repetitive and would be better suited with accompanying audio direction (I did noticed however she has a video available on her site). To help explain the language of the belly Lisa likens a women's belly to a bowl wrapped in a tattered cloth and bound with metal bands. A perfect mental image.<br /><br />This is definitely an interactive book. Another aspect is journaling to discover your feelings about your belly, past and present, bridging the barrier between your head and your belly. I know it sounds a bit funny but it is really a metaphor for your inner wisdom; although more corniness ensues with a page of affirmations like \\"I anticipate that loving my belly will sooth me the way a mama bear nourishes her cub.\\" Luckily there are not many but what's there makes it hard to take the content seriously. This is a very small area and can be easily substituted for affirmations of your own or skipped all together.<br /><br />After the breathing comes seven belly energizing moves (with related breathing exercises). They are a part of a series Lisa created and successfully taught in her classes, retreats, and workshops. She also admits to practicing them daily herself. Even though the book's focus is on the belly, the whole body participates and becomes aware of it self. The movements are controlled and non-threatening. They are not about working up a sweat but celebrating the belly.<br /><br />The WBB doesn't come into it's own until page 103. Here, Lisa shares her story; and in my opinion from here on is the best part of the book. She talks candidly about her eating disorder and how yoga was an integral part of her recovery not just with weight issues but life issues. Through the first half of the book I felt something was missing, this was it. I wish the book had started here. She goes on to discuss how our culture and history have affected our view of women both physically and intellectually. And we can't forget what's to come of the future.<br /><br />The Woman's Belly Book has the potential to encourage self awareness of ourselves as women through acceptance of our bellies and our creative nature if we open the door to breath, movement and intention. Or as Lisa says \\"ungirdle our bellies and let ourselves breath and feel.\\" The exercises are easy to follow although the breathing descriptions are so similar it may be easy to become confused which is which. This 125 page book, while not complete in itself, is a welcome addition to the self healing library.<br /><br />Originally Posted at [...]a very small area and can be easily substituted for affirmations of your own or skipped all together. <br /> <br />After the breathing comes seven belly energizing moves (with related breathing exercises).

Whether she's a positive or negative influence for large women depends on the group or individual. Despite her weight, she is the 'it girl' of the moment. She's also just another woman trying to make it through life the best she can. She just happens to be using her butt to do it instead of her breasts.<br /><br />\\"How to Lose your Ass...\\" is not a how-to book as the name suggests but a diary-biography. Each chapter opens with a few excerpts from Kirstie's diary followed by a vignette. Diary entries begin on December 31st, 2003 and end January 1st 2005. A year and a day. There aren't a lot of entries; about 63 ranging from a few lines to a few paragraphs. There's a mix up with dates on two entries that appear on the book flap and then again inside. This is not a tell-all book, just some exciting and sentimental tidbits, a few juicy parts. Each chapter reads like a complete story.<br /><br />Kirstie talks about sex with Tim Matheson (and a few other people), how she first learned about scientology, the secret behind the name Kirstie, her life long self esteem issues, and her assassin Corgi. Doing coke, decorating houses, lying to friends, family and to herself, and bringing 'Fat Actress' to fruition are all open to discussion. She talks about her daughter Lillie and son True and their issues with weight, hers and their own; the personal tragedy that led her to gain weight and the revelation and emotional release she witnessed with Dianetics. How she secretly blames John Travolta for everything, the death of her mother, and one of my favourite topics...airplane seats are all mentioned. The last chapter is the best of funny. I can't tell you why or the title because it would ruin it for you. Let's just say it's something everyone can relate to and leave it at that.<br /><br />Be prepared for some swearing and other vulgar analogies. She doesn't go overboard with them but they are present and may offend the delicate of mind. There's the occasional mention of her first marriage but not a lot about the who, when, what and how of it. There are lots of black and white photos from her childhood, a few of her children and of her beautiful parents. I would have liked more current photos of Kirstie included. Not embarrassing one that certain media like to focus on but something to bring the reader to the present.<br /><br />With Alley's book you are sure to experience some gentle giggles and some heart felt sighs. Her warm sensibility and mild sarcastic tone are reminiscent to a chat with an old friend. [How to Lose Your Ass and Regain Your Life] was an enjoyable look into one of Hollywood's foxiest women.

Cooke is another creative artist from down under. The Australian writer, cartoonist, filmmaker and columnist has a slew of works to her name. She is the creator of Hermoine, the Modern Girl, a colourful caricature who's also featured between the pages of Real Gorgeous.<br /><br />Real Gorgeous is about body shapes, body parts, exercise, plastic surgery, fashion, dieting, advertising, modelling, eating disorders, responding to the body police and so much more. Yes, it's a women's book but it is often directed toward girls too. It touches on so many topics relating to the body and beauty; providing some research, some quotes and some of the authors own opinions. Each chapter has suggestions for further reading.<br /><br />Real Gorgeous isn't a fat book but a body image book. Anyone is sure to find at least one of the anecdotes in the shadow boxes, placed throughout each chapter, to relate to. If there's one thing, this book shows it's that body image issues are more of a global issue than just within our group of friends. Canadians, Australians, and Americans are all dealing with similar issues regarding body image. Body image issues are also not delegated to one body type. Fat people don't have the monopoly on bad body image.<br /><br />It acknowledges the impact of family, friends, media and self perception on body image. Cooke exposes the fashion and diet industry for what they are... People \\"trying to sell you something.\\" She is quick to point out all the money we spend needlessly and what we're really getting for it. A real eye opener.<br /><br />Cooke summarizes a lot of points from others work to back up what she's saying. Not a page goes by without a quote from someone else. Many relevant quotes from Penelope Goward appear. There are quite a few anonymous quotes like, \\"a New York make-up artist says...\\" which I found irritating and at times caused me to question their validity.<br /><br />Sometimes it seems Cooke is checking to see if the reader is paying attention and will stick in nonsense comments, like during a listing of healthy eating she added, \\"Don't stick popcorn up your nose.\\" Silly but unexpected and funny none the less.<br /><br />There's an excellent section called Body Image Boosters the reader can return to again and again for ideas on how to give yourself a break from your own negativity. One of my favourite sections is what to say to the \\"Body Police\\". You know those people who never really have anything nice to say to you or who offer a compliment with a negative tag on the end.<br /><br />Real Gorgeous is an informative, light read with many sections for the stop and start reader. It provides an alternative look at the body and beauty from a personal perspective and that of others.

Bel Barrett is a women in her fifties who works as a New Jersey community college professor. In this instalment she gets more than expected (but not really) when she agrees to teach an extra evening writing class for seniors.<br /><br />Like previous instalments someone dies; in this case it turns out to be one of her students, racing pigeon master, 83 year old Dom Tomaselli. His body shows up frozen in the snow next to the house he shares with his children. An apparent accident. Dom's daughter, Flora (whose also one of Bel's students), doesn't think it was an accident and she's pretty sure her Uncle killed him over a long term debt. Bel soon finds out he is not the only suspect.<br /><br />Bel doesn't work alone on her search for the killer. Her side kicks, I mean best friends Illuminada and Betty are there pretty much every step of the way. Occasionally, she calls on her fianc&eacute; Sol Hecht for back up. The characters didn't stop there and this is one of the regrets for this book. Lots of names are mentioned in the first ten pages. The swamp made it hard to keep them straight and to remember who is who. It didn't get any better as more and more names were introduced throughout. Each chapter started off with an email or an excerpt from one of her student's memoirs. This just added to the who is who confusion.<br /><br />\\"Who cares?\\" was a common thought as I read through the chapter of her surprise wedding. I really didn't care who was sitting with who or knew who. It was a stagnant stop to what little momentum there was to the story.<br /><br />When a book is compared to the likes of Evanovich's Plum series I expect it to be an easy, funny read with some suspense. This book had none of these qualities. It took me three weeks to read while Evanovich's are usually done within two days. This story was dry and drowned out with lifeless characters. The interesting facts about pigeon racing (like the fastest pigeon clocked was 92mph, 49 mph faster than the fastest horse) are lost and seem like they were just stuck in for prosperity's sake. This book is not high on my list for recommendation.<br /><br />This Review was Originally Posted at [...]on racing (like the fastest pigeon clocked was 92mph, 49 mph faster than the fastest horse) are lost and seem like they were just stuck in for prosperity's sake.

Rita Farro worked with what she affectionately calls \\"gifted\\" women (or women any size over 10) for over a decade; first as a fabric store owner, then as a workshop presenter. The knowledge behind Life is Not a Dress Size also comes from her personal experience at being gifted herself.<br /><br />This book is about living in \\"a country that worships thinness\\", \\"developing personal style\\" and \\"learning to value yourself\\". A tall order for this little book. It also boasts a bonus sewing section with a few basic items like a wrap, scarf, belts. It's about working with what you have.<br /><br />Despite being almost ten years from its original publishing date, everything still applies (except the overstated eye clashing outfits...and stirrup pants). She delivers her story and thoughts from the perspective of an old friend instead of someone with a PhD who's never been 20lbs overweight in her life. The tone is conversational, honest and straight forward. Behind each opinion she offers legitimate commentary to back it up. She delves into the realms of low self esteem, fashion, style, sewing and being happy. She gently reminds we all have value.<br /><br />We are our own worst enemies. Farro insists our segregation from society is less to do with the food we eat and more to do with how we dress and carry ourselves in public. Because of Farro's personal voice/style this is an easy and quick read that leaves the reader refreshed instead of in a depressed afterglow. A large majority of the book is about first impressions, body types and how to camouflage them.<br /><br />She briefly touches on the fat stereotypes like, \\"She's fat, she must be lazy\\". Farro says we need to spend more time on our hygiene, clothing, make up and hair. That means no more running out to the corner store without a bra and the inner thigh material eaten out of your pants. Farro also strongly believes we should let go to the fantasy we are going to lose some weight. It's important to live in the moment and wear clothing that fits us now.<br /><br />She lightly mentions the diet industry but weight loss isn't a focal point in Life is Not a Dress Size. Despite the occasional bad clich&eacute; it's entertaining, easy to read, understandable, and educational. The few quizzes are simple and non-threatening. The glossy pages and short chapters make it durable and easy to use as a resource.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]e moment and wear clothing that fits us now.  <br /> <br />She lightly mentions the diet industry but weight loss isn't a focal point in Life is Not a Dress Size.

Peculiar in the sense they are taught from an early age to obsess about it. From early pintails and bobby socks to low-rise jeans and demi bras. Not to mention the money put in to soften, colour, and pluck every inch of our body if need be. No matter how much is done the satisfaction is short lived. It isn't long until the next thing needs to be fixed; like the diet that will finally give the hour glass figure we are all destined to have. Not. Is any woman truly at peace with every inch of her body?<br /><br />Hutchinson spent 17 years teaching workshops on body image. This little handbook is one of the babies birthed from her work. As the name suggests, she provides 200 ways to love the body you have. These \\"tools\\" arouse the senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste and scent. Not only are you given a mental workout you're required to involve yourself physically with breathing exercises, body movements, mediation, lots of visualizations and a whole lot of journaling<br /><br />You'll learn how your inner critic works and to recognize how your body responds to your emotions. If you're familiar with yoga you might be familiar with some of the meditations; like grounding yourself by using tree imagery. Although the tools sometimes seem repetitive, they may have to be to get you to open to the ideas.<br /><br />A really good one is number eleven, \\"Stop Comparing\\". Basically Hutchinson recommends we stop checking out what others have physically that we don't have, i.e. perky breasts, thin thighs; and look for opportunities to find likenesses with others.<br /><br />154, titled Hungry for What, implies changing what we put in our mouths is as easy as making a list of alternative actions. If it were that easy wouldn't there be less obese people? One or two border on corny but overall an interesting, quick and easy workbook.<br /><br />Another quip I have was the constant directions to post results in a prominent location as a reminder. With this repeated recommendation there'd be no place for anything else, like say, family pictures.<br /><br />This book is definitely for someone who can follow through every morning by getting up 15 minutes earlier, opening the book up anywhere and picking a tool at random. Tip: Leave a tiny post-it on the page so the next time you open the book there you know you've done it. Keep doing this until all the pages have a post-it. Then start again but this time removing the post-it for each one you work through.<br /><br />Even though there isn't a lot of text this is not necessarily an easy read. If you choose to work through the activities it forces you to come to terms with your feelings.

After seven years, environmental poet Di Brandt has released her fifth book of poetry. She's won numerous awards for her writing including the CAA National Poetry Prize. Now You Care is a poignant piece with its message beginning with the cover: power lines with green skeletons. You can't help but be effected from beginning to end.<br /><br />Now You Care is potent at times but deceptively safe. Brandt doesn't overstep any bounds into the grotesque. The flow of words is unhampered by periods giving it a feel of a conversation. Her imagery is vivid.<br /><br />Brandt words stab at what we know is true but often ignore because we are so unaffected until our bubble is popped and someone we love or even ourselves is put through an ordeal for lives. While Brandt words can sometimes be harsh and distracting from the real issue they are a wake up call to the world around us. The world we all live in.<br /><br />She talks a lot about breast victimization; it makes me wonder if someone close to her has lived through breast cancer for her to catch this topic by its heart. Now You Care isn't all doom and gloom, ok it mostly is.<br /><br />Throughout I kept wondering if she followed her own advice or if she contributes to the breakdown of the environment like everyone else (I didn't see anywhere that the book was printed on recycled paper for instance.) Everything from the conglomerates to politics is fare game. Especially America and Bush (\\"the enemy, their king will release us from her untimely<br />abandonment, like the Pharoah, like Herod, like Hitler, like Bush...\\")<br /><br />Now You Care is a wonderful read, a reminder of what we've done, what we should do and the cost of ignorance. At times it comes across a preachy but there's no way to approach the subject without that angle. Beautiful words, harsh lessons, worth reading. Reviewed by M. E. Wood	2005-01-13

It is also loaded with small and large photos showing the common aspects of a domestic cat's everyday life. The content is easy to read but entertaining enough for an accompanying adult to enjoy. The heavy pages make them durable for the 4-8 age recommended age group.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment was the listed price of $23.99CAN/15.99US. The bargain sections of any bookstore can usually turn up a substantially larger book for less. But this smaller size would give the child a bigger sense of accomplishment as it would probably only take one or two days to read and examine the photos.<br /><br />It's a good second cat book for young children.	2005-01-13

Harder still is her increasing awareness of her daughter's transformation into a woman and the knowledge of her best friend's marital infidelity. To liven her life up even more, her sex pot ex-husband drops in and smothers her with French compliments, French wine and French kisses.<br /><br />Jess leads an otherwise humdrum existence. She works for Art's Council for Kids and this year the rich mothers want her to organize \\"My Fair Lady\\" in an attempt to bring together the rich and poor kids in one extravagant production. She lives in a nice neighborhood and owns her own home in a New York suburb.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by this amusing read. It was easy to fall in love with Jess' character. She has a Bridget Jones wrong place at the wrong time quality, especially when it comes to her boss Joshua Gordon. She either has food on her face or her clothes twisted around in an inappropriate fashion implying she's not the sophisticated, intelligent woman she is. Despite her brains in being able to organize a troupe of rich bitches she falls short in a parents' sex-ed class when she peels her demonstration banana (yes to eat it) and then is disciplined for it. This scene was such a hoot but do they really make parents take sex-ed classes before their kids?<br /><br />The story didn't go where I thought it was moving and where I wanted it to go. The character of Joshua Gordon (Jess' uptight, business oriented, no manners boss. Who also happens to be gorgeous) seemed to be introduced too late to care about or want him involved with Jess. He was more of an inconvenience despite his pathetic divorce from a two timing wife.<br /><br />The excitement in Jess' life comes from her very rich producer friend Lucy Baldor. Lucy has been having an affair with a TV egomaniac, Hunter Green, whose show she's producing. Jess feels incredibly guilty about the affair because she's best friends with Lucy's husband Dan and their kids are also best friends. On numerous occasions Lucy turns Jess into her alibi. Jess allows her to buy her silence with trips, spa days, shopping sprees and invitations to botox parties. Lucy is a terrible friend and not a likeable character. Her self absorption is perfect for her current lover Hunter Green. The book descriptions describe their friendship as \\"the one true thing they can count on.\\" I didn't see it, feel it or believe it. Jess seemed more to tolerate Lucy as a distraction or form of entertainment. This is supposed to be the story about two women but really it's the story about Jess Taylor and her adventures in the world of the rich and insane oops, I mean rich and famous.<br /><br />Anyone who doesn't watch the TV and isn't up with the latest couture fashions may have trouble with the name and product dropping but this is only mildly distracting.<br /><br />The characters offer an interesting peek into the life of the rich and sort of famous though often scary and definitely not all the tube makes them out to be. I was kind of disappointed by the whole women can't be happy without a man scenario yet again but overall the book is a quick, smooth read balanced with a moderate entertainment value.reen, whose show she's producing.

She's created another episode in the life of Lestat the world's greatest vampire (at least in his mind). Blood Canticle is the tenth novel in The Vampire Chronicles although you do not have to read them in order to enjoy them or know what is going on.<br /><br />The first chapter is all Lestat. Conceded, whiny and all about his me, me, me attitude. Frankly you can skip this chapter as it really has nothing to do with the story. He did a wonderful job of annoying me the whole way through. The real story begins with chapter two. Quinn Blackwood (the focus of book nine Blackwood Farm) a newly anointed vampire by non-other than Lestat is the focus of Lestat's affection this time around. Rice really loves her triangles though and shortly the love of Quinn's life shows up on his doorstep sick and on the verge of her death. Lestat being the wonderful and loyal friend that he is gives Mona the dark gift as a favour for Quinn. She is magically transformed into this lithe of beauty with long curly red hair that is captivating to one and all. Her one flaw is she's extremely emotional and tends toward fits of crying and tantrums. These two characters remind me a lot of Louis and Claudia from Interview with a Vampire.<br /><br />Now we have a dashing trio of vampires. The dilemma put before them is Mona wants to find her child taken away at birth. Her child has the unique gift of being a Taltos, a group of secret people seven feet tall with no bone structure that grow to adult size within a few hours. It was this birth that put Mona (who's also a witch) on her deathbed.<br /><br />As with any good search there are obstacles along the way. The ghost of Quinn's dead mother whom he goes around telling everyone he killed by snapping her neck and throwing her in the swamp. Everyone thinks he's kidding but he's not. There's also the ghost of scary Uncle Julian and the adorable Stella. Uncle Julian is one of the finest characters in this story and is sure to make the hair on your arms stand up. Other obstacles include the Secret People themselves and whether or not they can or want to be found and a band of drug lords, a family of witches and of course the prince of darkness himself.<br /><br />One of the things I love about Anne Rice's books is her attention to detail especially when it comes to scenery. When reading it's obvious she loves New Orleans. Like an artist she paints its beauty, mystery and hidden darkness of the streets, architecture, natural surroundings and residents.<br /><br />Although Lestat is the narrator of this story he's not necessarily mainstream. He's sharing the stage with the other characters, his loves, although I think reluctantly. Lestat is not the gruesome killer he used to be. He's trying to be a reformed vampire. His personal goal is to become a saint and be adored by everyone but his internal demons seem to always get the better of him. If you pick up Blood Canticle you'll be able to witness another Lestat adventure. Most enjoyable.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]e finest characters in this story and is sure to make the hair on your arms stand up.

These are just a few of the questions Seymour Simon answers in Dogs.<br /><br />Dogs is loaded with small and large photos of many different breeds. It would have been nice if they were labeled. The front cover however does break down a few breeds under the five main breed: Hounds, Terriers, Sporting Dogs, Working Dogs, and Herding Dogs.<br /><br />I was disappointed in the size/price comparison of this book. A rather small book for the hefty price of $23.99 CAN. But surprised how much data was contained there in. The content is easy to read, to the point and entertaining enough for any adult that may be following along. The hardcover and heavy pages are sure to be durable for the recommended 4-8 age group.<br /><br />A fine second book if you can find it in your bargain section.	2005-01-13

Water Wings, through the help of one family explores what separates them. Their unique differences and the secrets not shared. Water Wings reads like a slow swim on a calm Sunday morning. It's smooth, even as it switches from one woman's perspective to the next. The family includes two generations; Darlene and her two daughters Hannah and Vivian and Darlene's sister Angie and her daughter Wren.<br /><br />Except for two small entries from Angie, Water Wings is written from the perspective of the three girls. The story begins with Hannah traveling back for Darlene's wedding. As the wedding gets closer we get to see glimpses into the three girls' childhood and how they witnessed and reacted to the people and events around them.<br /><br />Hannah spent a lot time in her own little world. She always wanted to be a Fergus, the family next store. At least until she got to know the dark secret that lived within the house. Hannah remembers days of the week as colours like Saturday is opaque pink, the day her father died. She is the younger of the two and was probably the more spoiled by her father. She takes Vivian's ridicule without question or malice. Hannah is the interesting one. She contains many dark and startling secrets from her childhood never sharing them with anyone, like the day Hannah witnessed Stuart Fergus kill a kitten then made her help bury it. She adored her father Mick and was the one most hurt and confused by his leaving.<br /><br />Vivian is the most like her mother although she doesn't know it and would thoroughly deny it. She struts around in bikinis in front of her mother's boyfriends. She's cold and calculated and her words sting. Especially the way she talks to Hannah. She takes great pride in correcting Hannah and telling her she's wrong. A way very similar to how Darlene treats Angie. Vivian is the stronger of the two. Mostly to counteract her weepy and dramatic mother.<br /><br />Wren was born with a birth defect in her arms giving the appearance of broken wings. She's an old soul with a strong voice to protect herself from the offences of others. During Brownies in which her mother forced her to go they always ended the evening with a circle. No one wanted to hold her hands. Wren feels all life is sacred down to the tiniest insect. She sees everything from a perspective of beauty and love. All this despite her emotionally stagnant mother.<br /><br />One of the biggest mysteries throughout is why Hannah and Vivian's father left. It dwells on the girls' minds, especially Hannah. Their parents seemed devastated by the divorce which confused them even more. The story is anticlimactic but an enjoyable read for passing the time. It's an interesting character study of women and what we do to one another. The secrets we keep and most importantly how each of us view and experience the same events differently.with a birth defect in her arms giving the appearance of broken wings.

Fitch describes the Santa Ana blossoms as desert survivalists as \\"delicate poisonous blooms\\" with \\"dagger green leaves.\\" Throughout this novel the words sing a poetic duet with the reader and, from her opening description, I was humming along.<br /><br />I felt a bit like a Peeping Tom as I spied on Fitch's fictional prose about the early years of Astrid Magnussen. From the beginning, I realized that the relationship between Astrid and her poet mother was unique, if not absurd.<br /><br />Astrid's search for love and affection from a parental figure deepens as she gets caught in the foster care system after her mother is scorned by a man, murders him, and is thrown in jail. Astrid feels responsible for her mother's actions and this man's death. \\"My responsibility. My infection,\\" she says. In fact, she feels responsible for every bad thing that happens to her and the people she chooses to love.<br /><br />This journey of an insecure and extremely talented young girl whose fear of losing her mother and being unloved drives her into relationships destined to fail, is heart wrenching. Bad things seem to follow Astrid wherever she goes. When she labels herself, \\"Nobody's Child\\" my heart fell and I wished I could reach out to help and protect her. In reality, she doesn't need it and if it was offered she would probably refuse.<br /><br />Astrid is strong, in spite of her obsessive love for her mother and the pseudo-replacements she finds at each of the foster homes she's sent to. Ray, the boyfriend of her first foster mother, is Astrid's first obsession. During this relationship, I had to keep reminding myself she was a child and not a woman. Her other obsessions include a prostitute and a paranoid/obsessive has-been actress. The detailed characters are marvelous.<br /><br />Fitch has painted Astrid and Ingrid perfectly. I felt for Astrid as she flip-flopped through her love and hate for her poetic angel, conniving mother. Ingrid, the beautiful, pale goddess has a demonic quality to her. She would rather her daughter live a violent, disdainful life than to have her live one of reasonable happiness. Ingrid's magnetic personality fascinates all who are susceptible to her black widow qualities. Throughout the book I felt a great hatred for this woman but at the same time a sense of curiosity; is there more to who she is? By the end of the book, this was answered. Astrid is definitely the adult in this dysfunctional family and she is wiser and stronger because of her mother.<br /><br />Fitch's use of abundant similes was somewhat distracting at first but once I got over my personal biases I quite enjoyed them. I also liked the Goddess references used throughout, specifically, Astrid's comparison of herself to Persephone when she was taken away for the first time by the social workers, This definitely sets the tone for the darkness that follows.<br /><br />Fitch successfully shows the suffering humans can inflict on themselves and those they claim to love. She transmits the possibility that we can outgrow ourselves and that we have a choice in the person we become despite how our past has shaped our psyche. Simply, this is the journey and survival through one woman's childhood and what she gained from the experience.<br /><br />Overall, White Oleander is enjoyable and the suspense and terror of Astrid's travels through the foster care system are engaging, often alarming and hold interest, if only to find out what else could possible happen to this poor child. If nothing else, you put down this book knowing that your life isn't as bad as you thought and you can deal with whatever it dishes you. Women persevering, I can see why it was an Oprah pick.

Tommy likes drugs and sex together. Tommy likes sex with women. Tommy likes sex with men. Tommy likes sex with himself. Tommy thinks a lot about sex when Tommy is not having sex. Now Tommy wants a child. What's poor Tommy to do?<br /><br />This book wasn't what I expected at all. I don't know what I expected, but this isn't it. This book is cheeky, seductive, gross, indecent, and at times mildly amusing. There I said it. Or did I?<br /><br />The first person dialogue flip flops into the every day life of Tommy, a scrawny adult photographer's assistant who wants to be a carefree teenager while having sex in public washrooms whenever he pleases. The problem is: Tommy is getting older and so are all his friends. Adding further insult, Tommy becomes depressed. Long passages of narrative become repetitive after a while. Tommy never seems to gain any ground. His own epiphanies arise and are ignored, like \\"We all live life so fast these days that we don't even process what we're doing a lot of the time.\\" Bingo!<br /><br />Tommy isn't alone on his journey of self-discovery. Like Chic Lit, there are the stereotypical best friends/roommates and of course one of them is gay. In this case his roommates are Sadie and Bobby and then there's Charlie. Charlie is the closest thing Tommy has to a regular boyfriend but he can't decide if that's the direction he wants to take. Mostly because he's afraid of ruining (or disappointing) Charlie's eight year old son Finn, who's more mature than the adults in his life. Then there's the nerdy boss, Julian, who lives vicariously through Tommy's stories every Monday morning.<br /><br />If you're a homophobe this book definitely isn't for you. There are graphic sex scenes of all degrees between men and women. Seems more like an effort to be shocking then to tell a tale.<br /><br />But even so, one can only read about some raunchy guy having sex with just about anything that moves so many times before it become tiresome. If you read closely, between the sex, drugs and sex he's surprisingly philosophical. Overall, slow action, periods of monotonous dialogue with himself and the reader. A boring foray through the annals of alternative British society.<br /><br />Once you get past the grunge and shock factor of the book there's a young man who's trying to grow up and find himself. He does a lot of thinking (and drugs) along the way. Did I like this book? Afraid not, it just wasn't my cup of tea. I wanted to read it because Alan Cumming, the actor, wrote it and in this case it wasn't enough to improve my impression of the book.<br />(...)closely, between the sex, drugs and sex he's surprisingly philosophical.

She works as a cleaning lady with an ethnic family. Lucky for her, her only duty is emptying the garbage cans. Not a dream job but it pays the bills. \\"Destitute, depressed, and almost universally derided,\\" is how she describes herself. The only positive thing Allison can say is she has a beautiful voice. Her only real wishes are to meet her biological parents and to find a way to get rid of her sex starved, vindictive roommate, Virginie.<br /><br />The one person in her life who is compassionate towards her is Nathan. They work in the same building and meet during breaks to discuss movies, plants and other people who work in the building. They aren't companions or even friends but she has attached her affection to him. He's nothing special, balding and a bit scrawny but he's nice to her. He's her Brad Pitt.<br /><br />One morning she wakes up and her body has been transformed by we don't know what and we never find out. She's now taller, slimmer, blonder...well more like Gwyneth Paltrow with bigger breasts. She seems only mildly shocked by this transformation and after a brief stint of enjoying the feel of her new body she decides she has to show it off immediately in case it disappears at midnight. Her first manner of business was to seduce a construction worker in broad daylight even after he confessed he'd only been married six months and had a baby on the way. I found this hard to swallow as her first desire in her new body.<br /><br />While enjoying the new life (because of new body) she decides to get back at or ruin all the people in her life who've been mean to her. The \\"ugly acts\\" range from minor to serious. Her character definitely isn't likeable in her new form at least not from a reader's perspective. She's suddenly the center of attention wherever she goes. Something she never experienced as the old Allison. She becomes drunk on the affection and attention. Allison isn't so beautiful on the inside anymore.<br /><br />Through Friedman's writing it's easy to hate this character yet root for her when she gets back at everyone (at least until she goes way over board) who was nasty to her for being plump and homely. Most of the other characters are easy to hate too. They're nasty people.<br /><br />This is not my first contact with this author. I also read her poetry book Know Your Monkey which I loved. Regretfully, in the end, Waking Beauty didn't win me over. There is a lack of balance amongst characters. It would have been nice to get to know some nicer people. It may have made this read less dark. In the end, the reader is still left asking why did this happen to this particular girl and how?

Sometimes it seems as though that voice is never quiet. It is constantly telling us things. Usually things we already know. Miguel Ruiz calls this the Voice of Knowledge or the \\"prince of lies.\\" The voice of knowledge knows everything about you and everyone else or so it would like to have you believe.<br /><br />Miguel Ruiz's latest book The Voice of Knowledge focuses on that voice. The majority of what the voice says is negative; even if you think it's positive it probably isn't as positive as you would think. Ruiz wants us to be able to understand how the voice works so we can better control it. Most of what it says is useless information. This negative voice is what causes the majority of people to seek releases elsewhere with alcohol, drugs or even food.<br /><br />To better explain how the voice works, Ruiz uses personal anecdotes. Right from the beginning I was on guard. I have a problem with knowledge being looked at as a bad thing and a great part of the opening was about how bad knowledge is. It wasn't until later he confirmed knowledge isn't the problem, \\"the problem is what contaminates it.\\" Another thing about the opening that bothered me was his comment that his perspective may or may not be true because it was from his perspective.<br /><br />I continued to swim in and out of skepticism as I read. According to Ruiz our head is full of lies and everyone is always trying to inflict their story on us and us on them. I put him in this category as well. He's just another story teller trying to tell us what we are doing wrong with our lives. Supposedly, once we are able to understand this we'll stop trying to control things we have no control over: each other.<br /><br />A big part of his book is about faith. He wants readers to regain their lost faith in themselves, their lives, the world and most of all in love.<br /><br />Half way through I had a Dr. Phil book plug moment when Ruiz brought up his other book, The Four Agreements. This section seemed more like a long advertisement for this book which was disappointing. The information is also available on his website.<br /><br />At certain points the book becomes \\"God\\" preachy but I survived and feel one step closer to quieting the prince of lies. The Voice of Knowledge is a very short book and is very repetitive in trying to get its main points across. Basically knowledge is bad, don't believe yourself and don't believe other people. I felt like he was dancing around what he really wanted to say but that could be me imposing my story on his. Or maybe not.<br /><br />Ruiz didn't offer many suggestions for quieting the voice other than wordless music or prayer (he provided a couple in the back of the book.) He also didn't make any promises that you could. Everyone's different and the way they control their voices I expect it is also different.<br /><br />As you can see I'm a bit resistant to most of the book. On a positive note, I did find myself more aware of my voice. With that awareness I was able to quiet it more than I have in a while. With that there is a feeling of peace. The kind you get when the kids are away for the day and there are no appointments in your day planner. Now that my scepticism has wavered slightly I'd like to re-read The Voice of Knowledge again with my new perspective.<br /><br />If this is something you want to do then this book will help. If you are looking for a miracle to inner peace well I think you'd be better off searching elsewhere.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]t up his other book, The Four Agreements.

Waxworks is her third book of poems and this is my second detour into her mind, the first being her poetry debut Wooroloo. Waxworks carries the same dark blanket of Wooroloo but this one is more fun.<br /><br />Hughes, an artist, created the work for the cover. It features a mystical sculpture of a woman with golden hair with subtle snakeheads at the end. Appropriately, Medusa is the first poem presented and introduces the flavour to follow: \\"She is a gypsy / Whose young have rooted / In the very flesh of her scalp.\\"<br /><br />Eighty more characters from both fiction and non-fiction are examined. Biblical people like Judas, Lazarus, the Horsemen and Satan; some from Greek Mythology like Hera and Circe; tales from Merlin and Morgan le Fey and childhood characters like Cinderella, Rumpelstiltskin. The different genres of tales are split making you go back and forth between them as you read.<br /><br />Just in case you don't know who the characters are, there is a note on each one in the back of the book describing what they are known for. The only poem that doesn't have a description is Satan.<br /><br />Hughes brings alive a few little-known tales like that of Sweeny Todd, a barber who slit the throats of his patrons for the meat pies he sold in a neighbouring business. Then there is Burke and Hare who lured travelers to their boarding house, killed them, then sold their bodies for research just to make a few cents.<br /><br />The dark twisted acts of betrayal, murder or slander are as good as any thriller film and leave a lasting impression like in Jezebel. I found Morgan Le Fey a bit confusing; specifically the last three stanzas where the perspective seemed to switch to Merlin's making me forget I was reading a poem about Morgan. Although this may have been intention since some versions of the tale ascribe they are one in the same.<br /><br />While most of the poems I mention here carry a bit of gore they also carry a moral or metaphor of some kind. I love Hughes interpretation. If you have an interest in any of these themes, I recommend this book. If you can't bear a little darkness within the light then I don't recommend this book. If you've never experienced Frieda Hughes, I recommend this book. If you're a fan of Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes (Frieda's parents), that isn't reason enough to venture into Frieda's mind. Her work stands on its own and should be looked at as such. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]carry a bit of gore they also carry a moral or metaphor of some kind. I love Hughes interpretation.

It's named after a small village in Australia in which Hughes lived for a time, painting. The colourful painting on the cover was Hughes handiwork. She's an award-winning painter and author of six children's books. I suppose it would also be pertinent to mention she is the daughter of Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes, both renowned poets. I didn't find out this latter information until after I read her book. Who her parents were/are should have no bearing on her work and I also think should have no bearing on whether you add this book to your poetry collection. While her relationship with her parents may have affected her writing her voice is all her own.<br /><br />At times, it seems Hughes has an eye for the macabre. You really have to think about the imagery this poet is describing and then it hits you. Like the last stanza of Dead Cow describing the birth of maggots. Fields, farming, foxes and kookaburra's are mentioned often in this collection and give an indication of how the landscape she lived in influenced her. She intertwines nature and the human quotient to carve<br /><br />potent images not soon forgotten.<br /><br />If I had to pick one poem from this collection as my favourite it would be Caesarian. Although dealing with the bloody, she's added a humorous visual of a child not wanting to leave the security of the womb for the noisy atmosphere of our society, especially in the first stanza when she says it's trying \\"To climb right back up again.\\" Again in the third stanza: \\"With its feet on either side/ Of its mothers gaping manhole.\\" In contrast, Hysterectomy provides a powerful bodily emotion of seriousness.<br /><br />Others worth noting are Frances, Rosa, and Winifred which provide intimate character detailing of three old ladies in a hospital.<br /><br />This collection provided an interesting portraiture of life and death and the living in between that was both visually and emotionally stirring. I recommend you take a gander.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]mmend you take a gander. <br /> <br />Review Originally Posted at [...]	2005-01-12

On Blondes is about the people who love it, those who desire it, those who fake it, those who steal it, those who envy it, those who paint it, those who write about it, and those who kill in the name of it. She follows the allure of blonde hair through time from the days of Aphrodite to modern day Hollywood.<br /><br />Each chapter directs the reader through the seductive seven lives of Blonde hair from the Dark Ages to present day. Pitman teaches the extremes that the Romans and Greeks and succeeding generations went to for blonde curls. This self-abuse for blonde went on for centuries to the detriment of health and scalp. Substances as natural as saffron and as toxic as ammonia, bleach and the aforementioned goat urine were used to achieve the desired shade of blonde.<br /><br />The zest for blonde has not always been positive; in fact most of it seemed quite negative. \\"Blonde hair was highly divisive and provoked extreme reactions.\\" Nowhere is this more apparent than during Hitler's reign. Pitman's journey into Teutonic and Aryan history is informative and answered many questions for me on the German philosophy of Blonde hair/blue eyed superiority and how Hitler managed to promote it despite his dark colouring; propaganda. After World War II the world knew of Germany's love of blonde hair.<br /><br />This book reads like a weekly dose of the History channel with each chapter being a new episode in the series of events. In some areas she seems to ramble off topic, going on about relationships or other personal quirks of the personalities. The history of the white flour wigs drags on long after the main idiosyncrasies were driven home.<br /><br />In the afterword Pitman states she approached \\"several American women academics,\\" on the study potential of blondeness and they \\"refused to discuss it at all.\\" Perhaps a sign that they are embarrassed they didn't discover the topic themselves. I'm sure Pitman's On Blondes will be a text in future feminine study.<br /><br />On Blondes left a lasting impression on me. I've begun to question every form of blondeness that I see. From a blonde perspective this is an informative book but I wonder if there would be the same interest with the brunettes and redheads of the world. And for those who may be wondering, yes it is natural.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]scover the topic themselves.

He is a \\"second-generation blue\\" who is constantly battling to establish himself as a reliable and trustworthy officer. His father committed suicide over an unarmed punk dealer he killed, having thought he had a gun. Gurson was a child when it happened, and he's been trying to live it down his whole life.<br /><br />Didi Kane is Gurson's lesbian, African American partner. She's a tough-nosed woman in a white man's world, but she holds her own. At least until her previous partner, Charlene Leone, shows up dead. Not far away, Gurson, out for a walk, happens upon another corpse, psychoanalyst Orville Gretz, dead of supposed carbon monoxide poisoning. Gurson is the only one who doesn't think it's a suicide. Everyone else thinks Gurson is too close to the case and his judgment is impaired because his dad committed suicide the same way.<br /><br />It comes out that Didi and Charlene were lovers and may have fudged some reports. Suddenly Didi is a probable suspect in Charlene's murder. Didi and Gurson decide to keep working together. They begin investigating the sordid lives of Charlene and Orville, two apparently unrelated deaths.<br /><br />Gurson's archrival in this story is Tucker Norville, an Assistant District Attorney whose goal in life is to make everyone miserable, especially Gurson. He's an alcoholic and jealous man, who is determined to break Gurson like he broke his father. He was the man prosecuting Gurson's father and he takes every opportunity he can to bring it up and rub it in Gurson's face. Like father, like son, is Norville's motto when it comes to the Gurson men.<br /><br />An Hour to Kill has a shaky start. The opening scene had a peeping-tom spying on a guy being gratified in an alley. This was followed by a psychoanalyst lusting after one of his patients and copulating with another in his office. It made me wonder if there was going to be a real plot, or just a lot of shock factor.<br /><br />Throughout the book the reader is lead to believe the killer is one character but near the end there are more than a few curves. I realize it's supposed to be a mystery but I felt like the severe turns were more of a deception. Once the change happened it became obvious where the new direction was heading.<br /><br />Another annoyance was the confusing point of view and lack of differentiation among character's dialogue. This occurred throughout. They all spoke with the same short and often incomplete sentences, which also contributed to the point of view problem.<br /><br />Despite these complaints, I didn't stop reading. It's like when you come across a traffic accident. You know you shouldn't gawk but you do anyway. I gawked into a strange world of fetish sex and psychologically dysfunctional people (not your average dysfunctional ones, either.) If you like books with sex, violence and demented characters then I'm sure you'll like this one<br /><br />[...]book the reader is lead to believe the killer is one character but near the end there are more than a few curves.

They have over 30 books to their credit. I am not sure what happened here.<br /><br />Second Sunrise begins on a dark night in the secluded hills of Fort Wingate, New Mexico, when state patrolman Lee Nez's life is forever altered. Lee and his rookie partner Benny interrupt a military ambush massacre. Benny is murdered and Lee is mortally injured. Lee wakes a new man, a nightwalker, which apparently is the Navajo word for vampire.<br /><br />The story jumps to sixty years later. Lee continues to search for the nightwalker who transformed him and to fend off the skinwalkers who want the immortal properties of his blood. Skinwalker is a term for Navajo witches able to shapeshift into wolves.<br /><br />Just when you thought that every vampire story had been told, the Thurlos come out with a fresh twist. Second Sunrise is no Dracula and the Thurlos are no Bram Stoker. I love vampire stories. I didn't like this book, at least not as a whole.<br /><br />There was much about the story that I enjoyed. The supporting character FBI Agent Diane Lopez is strong, confident and can hold her own despite the gravity of the situations in which she finds herself. The premise of Navajo magic and the ancient history behind it and its people is intriguing and well presented, describing cultural cues like finger pointing and waiting outside to be invited in.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found the first chapters slow and tedious. From the jacket cover I already knew someone was going to die and that Lee would become a nightwalker. This section took too long to get to the point. Throughout the novel there was a lot of telling going on. Too much time was spent talking about personality traits instead of showing them through actions. This made it difficult to connect with the lead character positively or negatively, therefore there was no emotional involvement with him, his life or his actions.<br /><br />Second Sunrise was overly repetitive. Benny's death and the young bride and infant son he leaves behind are mentioned four times in the first 83 pages. Totally unnecessary and irritating. The story isn't so involved that the reader wouldn't remember a driving force such as this. There are many other instances of this kind of repetition.<br /><br />The language reflected this redundancy, with overused phrases, unnecessarily mundane details, and facts pointed out to the reader evident within the scene. All these details make it seem as though readers have short attention spans.<br /><br />I believe this could have been an exciting addition to the vampire genre. I just think it was released too soon. So much more could have been done with it. It needs to be tidied up. Perhaps it would have helped to have the point of view in first person. If you want to read a different twist on the vampire story then pick this up but if you want a gripping tale with believable characters you can sympathize with and be moved by, this isn't it.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]verly repetitive.

The emphasis though is not on the writer of The Scarlet Letter or The House of the Seven Gables but on the more personal side witnessed within his journals. This Hawthorne collection features journal writings titled Twenty Days with Julian and Little Bunny, by Papa and three short stories: Young Goodman Brown, The Minister's Black Veil and Rappaccini's Daughter.<br /><br />Auster's voice is relaxed, honest and comfortable to listen to as he continues with Twenty Days, reading Hawthorne's \\"account of a man taking care of his child by himself.\\" Hawthorne wrote about his interactions and observations of his five year old son Julian during a three week period in 1851 while his wife and daughter were away visiting. Auster says the notebook was for Hawthorne's wife Sophia so she could read about what they did while she was away.<br /><br />Hawthorne's reflections are almost reminiscent of Michael Keaton in Mr. Mom. They are light, loving and believable. In-depth descriptions of their activities, meetings, power struggles, walks and meals have a familiar and endearing quality to them. Children in the mid 1800's are surprisingly similar with children of today. Amusing.<br /><br />His journal is full of scenic descriptions, character studies and lessons to Julian. Bits of Hawthorne's personality bleed into the diary. Like his penchant for paranoia shown by his need to deliver a letter to the post himself. He wrote a letter to Phoebe (nickname for his wife Sophia) and handed it over to a visitor who was also going to post. He later wished he hadn't and promised to post another himself because there was no guarantee whether it would be posted. Hawthorne's love of nature is also apparent in his recurring descriptions of their daily walks.<br /><br />Following Hawthorne's diary entries are three strange, dark stories narrated by James Naughton (actor). I was left wondering why they were compiled with the light cheery reflections of Hawthorne's journal. The transition from one reader to another was also unnerving and awkward.<br /><br /> Young Goodman Brown begins with a young married man (Goodman Brown) saying goodbye to his new bride, Faith, despite her begging him not to go. At the beginning of his journey he meets up with a strange man and they walk along a wilderness path (something Nathanial did daily according to Twenty Days). The path seems to be a metaphor for evil. The old man talks about knowing Goodman's father and grandfather and his relationship to the other villagers. There are a few play on words like his wife's name is Faith and at one point he screams, \\"I have lost my Faith!\\" having obvious double meaning. If it's yet not obvious to you what this story is about it is because it wasn't clear to me either but I gather it has something to do with one man's struggle with his conscious good and evil both real and imagined.<br /><br />The Minister's Black Veil is also full of metaphors. Again we see the involvement of the townspeople in this story that's supposed to be a parody. One day Mr. Hopper, a minister, walks about town with a black veil covering his eyes but his mouth and chin remain exposed. All want to know why. The town folk are upset by this change in their friendly minister who even wears the veil during his service causing the folks to read more into his sermon than usual. A man they've known well has suddenly become a man they feel they don't know at all. During the story he attends a funeral, church service and wedding. It's an interesting moral tale.<br /><br />Rappaccini's Daughter is equally as dark. A bored young, Italian writer named Giovanni becomes distracted by a luscious garden and fountain outside the window of the room he rents and most importantly the daughter of the plants' caretaker, Beatrice. This is a strange tale about a girl raised in seclusion by her scientist father among poisonous plants and who has become a poison herself. Slow to start but has a twisted unsuspecting outcome.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Hawthorne's Twenty Day's Diary and was slow to warm up to the short stories mostly because I was expecting them to have the same flair as the journal. Both create different moods but are worthy of your listening time.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]hter of the plants' caretaker, Beatrice.

No one suspected a \\"well-bred, Vassar educated descendent of Puritan Clergy\\" would join a communist party and run \\"two of the most productive spy rings in America.\\" That is exactly what Bentley, code name Clever Girl, did. Equally unexpected was her transformation from spy to FBI informant.<br /><br />It all started in March of 1935 when Bentley was lured to an American League Against War and Fascism meeting by a neighbour. It turned out to be a front for the Communist Party. Kessler's descriptions draw the reader into the setting and give an idea of the atmosphere, as well as Bentley's mentality. Clever Girl attempts to shed light on the motivations of the most important woman to affect the McCarthy Era.<br /><br />Bentley's early dealings with the party made her feel important and independent. She lived in a one room apartment and was unemployed. She was lonely. Going to meetings may have started off as a social event but it turned into something more. A calling. She was impressionable. In the opening chapter I felt she had been brainwashed and lured into the fold because of her loneliness, desire to have a family and ties with others.<br /><br />Shortly after joining, Bentley met and fell in love with soviet handler Jacob Golos whom she affectionately called Yasha. Golos was the glue that attached Bentley to the party for years despite him not being as loyal to her. She let him interpret the world for her through his communist eyes. Regardless of what she gave up for him, it is because of her association with Golos she was able to move up through the ranks. After only 6 years (1935-1941), Bentley was running things.<br /><br />When it was discovered he was no longer in control she had to fight to maintain her status. She quickly became deemed a problem and after Golos death her status was taken away. Although Kessler doesn't come out and say it, I think this had more to do with her being a woman than the fact she was an American in a high ranking, Soviet spy position.<br /><br />When things started to look worse, she decided it as time to go to the FBI for help. In exchange Bentley named hundreds of Americans involved with the party. It is incomprehensible, the number of people who willingly supplied sensitive information from the Treasury Department to the party. It isn't so hard to believe or see the Soviet Union (the US wartime ally) as an \\"evil-doer\\" but what is difficult to believe is that Americans could be spies against their own country.<br /><br />What I found most interesting was not Bentley's plunge into the depths of communism but her relationship with the FBI and media after she became an informant; as well as her flip flop between a secure, independent woman of means and a neurotic paranoid, probably brought on by the alcohol abuse.<br /><br />Bentley played a game with both sides, never winning in either. She survived under a short-lived spotlight in each. Being an FBI informant wasn't as glamorous as being a Soviet spy. As a spy she basically worked alone and had control over what happened to her. As an FBI informant she was constantly scrutinized by the FBI, congress and most indignantly by the media. Her life was never normal. While most days I think she reveled in the limelight I also think that she longed for privacy, but mostly I think she longed for their respect.<br /><br />The stereotypes of this time period are evident and well known. Bentley was a woman in a male dominated society. She held a high-ranking position but she was never really respected for it. Not by the Soviets, the FBI, nor the media who directed lots of name calling her way. If she had been a man I wonder what their views would have been of her and how she would have been handled. Clever Girl shows the life of Elizabeth Bentley, the past she couldn't outrun and the price she paid for the choices she made. Kessler's interpretation of the facts is worth reading both for its historical and entertainment value.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]its historical and entertainment value.  <br /> <br />Review Originally Posted at [...]	2005-01-02

Shave? Get an eyelash out of your eye? When you are walking by a department store window and see a person out of the corner of your eye, how do you know the reflection you are looking at is \\"you\\"?<br /><br />Dr. Julian Keenan, Director of the Cognitive Neuroimaging Laboratory and Associate Professor at the Department of Psychology at Montclair State University, had similar questions and many more during his study of self-awareness. The Face in the Mirror is sort of a summary of that work and the documented research relating to it. Keenan states the \\"purpose of this book is to tell the story of self-awareness\\".<br /><br />Keenan discusses the definition of self-awareness, what it means to us and how to measure it scientifically. Self recognition and Theory of Mind are thoroughly described with wonderful examples to help laymen comprehend them. He details previous studies spanning hundreds of years.<br /><br />A major portion of The Face in the Mirror discusses where in the brain these areas exist. Keenan believes the right hemisphere (generally ignored) holds the key to our self-recognition and self-awareness and he discusses numerous studies he feels proves it.<br /><br />This book is not only for the scholarly, which was what I was expecting. Keenan's writing style is understandable and surprisingly light. He made numerous attempts to lighten the content with personal anecdotes, analogies and humor which also provide a better understanding.<br /><br />The Face in the Mirror forces us to think and question how we see ourselves. It also makes us wonder about the skills we have and often take for granted. While it cannot change our basic construct, it helps us to understand why we are the way we are and shows what, in one researcher's opinion, \\"identifies us as fully human.\\" The Face in the Mirror is successful in explaining its purpose and its arguments are effective and persuasive.

With Flash Jackson around she doesn't have to face her fears or come to terms with her losses. The Adventures of Flash Jackson is written from the perspective of a twenty something Haley. Her nickname, Flash Jackson, stemmed from a game she played with her now deceased father in which they pretended to be stuntmen.<br /><br />Kowalski has written Haley's voice as educated, conversational, witty and without shame. I found myself reading her voice with a light southern twang even though the story takes place just outside the fictional town of Mannville, New York. Haley tells the reader that this is \\"a record of my seventeenth year,\\" and she warns \\"I'm writing this for myself...\\" This kind of tongue in cheek candor is speckled throughout. The fact that her mouth sometimes moves faster than her thoughts is amusing despite the trouble she gets into or the hurt feelings she creates. She struggles to make the things and people around her bend to her will but once she becomes incapacitated she learns she really doesn't have the control she thinks she does.<br /><br />During one of Haley's tomboy adventures she breaks her leg in three places causing her to be bed-ridden. Through her forced immobilization she begins to learn new things about the people in her life that ultimately leads to the realization of her own character and the development of the woman she is to become.<br /><br />Haley is accompanied through her year of reminiscing by her slightly neurotic, lonely mother; her pot-growing, Mennonite grandmother; her schizophrenic friend Frank; her guidance counselor, neighbor Ms. Powell and a host of wildlife, domesticated and otherwise.<br /><br />I was skeptical from the beginning that Kowalski could pull off a feminine character (my bias) but quickly forgot about the writer's gender as I became absorbed in Haley's life and surroundings. Especially when she went off to live with her grandmother in the forest, secluded from people and without what we know as the bare necessities: electricity, running water, and indoor toilet. While with her grandmother Haley learns many things about the natural arts and an appreciation for silence.<br /><br />In the beginning Haley tries to fight the laws of nature but succumbs due to wasted effort and little success. A good example would be bathing. She fought to keep some form of cleanliness but her daily toils prevented her so she gave in and developed an awareness of her new odor.<br /><br />I do not have many complaints about this book save one. The grandmother's dialogue is difficult and slowed down reading unnecessarily. \\"Den varom willst Du k no from ich?\\" I would have preferred a description of her dialect rather than trying to decipher her speech patterns.<br /><br />Witchcraft has saturated the film and TV industry over the last few years. It seems have become a fad in many instances and although it appears in this story it doesn't overwhelm or take anything away from the characters. The magic in Flash Jackson is more than a belief system. It's the everyday magic right in front of our eyes.<br /><br />The Adventures of Flash Jackson is a complete book but I want to know what adventures Haley Bombauer survived after her 17th year. I hope Kowalski will consider serializing Haley. I'm sure you will too.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]bed in Haley's life and surroundings.

Usually, it was something like: I'm a writer of a women's studies book rather than blurting out, \\"I wrote a book about c*&^s. And you?\\" I found the same to be true when asked \\"So, what are you reading these days.\\"<br /><br />Now that I've finished reading Muscio's book, I'm quite happy to tell people about it and freely voice the title. It's not because of any one thing she's said. The book as a whole is a gem once you get past the F-word in every second sentence. It was a distraction in the beginning but not anymore so than the title of the book.<br /><br />The book gives some biology, some current state of affairs, and some history on the weight women have had to bear because they have c-word(s). Muscio wants women, transgenders etc.. to reclaim the word from men. The word is just a metaphor for a bigger picture. C-word(s) haven't been important to women in the last 200+ years but they have earned men an awful lot of money, among other things. Although the bold Muscio is not so gentle with the terminology.<br /><br />Muscio wants women to start regaining their power, not as men bashing feminists but as the intelligent and beautiful goddesses we are. Doing this requires some responsibilities of us. Beginning with taking back the language. Learning about our bodies, self protection. Providing a support network. Muscio covers all these things. I found the passages on bleeding and rape to be especially effective, moving and educational. I wish I had read this book as a teenager.<br /><br />To say some of what Muscio has to say is eyebrow lifting is an understatement. I didn't agree with some of the things she said, especially her idolization of prostitutes into goddesses serving an important role in society. In fact, I found most of what she had to say about whores to be garbage. The profession of prostitution is just one more male dominated form of women abuse. I also refuse to smash my teevee to bits as I'm quite content to be deluded by my one channel.<br /><br />If you are sensitive to swear words and church bashing, this book probably isn't for you. But if you can get past it you might just learn something about your c-word and women as a whole.<br /><br />Serious stuff? Can be at times but Muscio's little life antidotes lighten things up and give perspective on her choices and thoughts. I like how she doesn't claim to know everything but encourages women to discuss the topics in their own circles.<br /><br />This is the book's second edition. It includes a huge afterward of updates on Muscio's previous thoughts not because she feels anything is wrong or out of place but because ideas have evolved. She loses me a bit here when she goes off on politics and Bush (could be because I've been over-Bushed lately). At the end is an incredibly huge section of recommendations for surfing the net. Everything from alternative women's magazines and sex toys to educational resources and all natural pads.<br /><br />So go pick up your book today. Read it and then start talking about it to the women in your life. Share your book with others. Encourage discussion. Only through discussion and understanding can we reclaim our C-word(s) along the other aspects of our lives.<br /><br />[...]ion of prostitution is just one more male dominated form of women abuse.

Along the way they decided to camp overnight in the desert, specifically Carlsbad Caverns National Park. The desert temperature was over 95 degrees during the day. It was suggested to the young friends that they have one gallon of water each. Since they were only planning on an overnight stay, they had 3 pints and a bottle of Gatorade between them. One of the bottles was wasted boiling hot dogs. It was late when they finally set up camp and called it a night.<br /><br />In the morning they packed up and headed back to the car but they never found it. One night turned into three before someone came looking for them. By then David was dead, killed by his best friend.<br /><br />Journal of the Dead explores the making of the friendship, their similar backgrounds, and events leading up to the murder as well as the final fallout.<br /><br />In the introduction Kersten states he presents the details as fact to \\"leave it up to the reader to believe it or not.\\" Kersten poured over testimonies from the trial, a journal found at the scene, physical evidence, interviews and field trips to the murder site. Raffi refused to be interviewed so info is from logged court testimony.<br /><br />From the moment Raffi was found, he maintained the act was a mercy killing. \\"He asked me to do it...\\" for Skepticism is raised from the beginning. David was painted as a friendly, carefree, healthy athletic man who took joy in spending time with his friends, especially Raffi and his girlfriend. While Raffi was supported by David's parents there was always the underlying unanswered question of his true motives. I felt that Raffi's act was that of murder and not a mercy killing. By the end, I felt Kersten did too. The way the \\"facts\\" were presented may have biased my opinion of Raffi but then, he did murder his \\"best friend.\\" The story makes no bones about whether Raffi did the deed but it makes you consider why someone would take it upon themselves to kill a loved one.<br /><br />Kersten's imagery of the friendship, towns, home environment, and the place of tragedy are vivid. He provides background information on the territory and desert survival to accentuate the graveness of the situation the boys found themselves in. Kersten also settled many myths about surviving in the desert, like vultures and drinking one's bodily fluids.<br /><br />Journal of the Dead has all the makings of a mystery/crime novel; keeping the reader's attention, challenging beliefs in right and wrong, and not letting all the important details out before the conclusion. Without coming out and asking, it makes you question what you would do if you were in the same situation. This is a wonderfully written story. It just breaks my heart it is not a piece a fiction. Journal of the Dead is well worth the read.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]you consider why someone would take it upon themselves to kill a loved one.

Miles is no stranger to this form having produced the \\"Guenevere Trilogy.\\"<br /><br />Isolde lives in Ireland with her mother the Queen, a sex addict, and the queen's many knights. She fights with her mother constantly and wishes nothing more than to leave, like most young women stuck at home with their mothers. Isolde's character often comes off as childish and annoying. Not to mention extremely paranoid, something I don't see from a woman trained by a Lady of Avalon.<br /><br />Tristan of Lyonesse is the nephew of King Mark of Cornwall. After Tristan's father remarries a treacherous woman he is asked to leave the family and life he loves. He becomes a knight in his uncle's court where he becomes King Mark's chosen heir because he has no son, much to the dismay of another nephew at court.<br /><br />Britain and Ireland go to battle. Tristan is wounded and separated from his troops and surprisingly (not) is found by Isolde who nurses him back to health. He does not reveal who he is to her and they spend much time together and of course fall in love. There is a lot of foretelling throughout and the story is somewhat predictable.<br /><br />When Tristan goes back to Britain, Isolde feels betrayed and vows never to love again. This oath seems a bit extreme to me as I did not feel the love between them.<br /><br />Tristan is also heartbroken with leaving her behind and indirectly asks King Mark to arrange a marriage with the Queen of Ireland's daughter but Mark confuses the request and plans to wed Isolde himself. Isolde easily gives in to her mother's request to marry King Mark to bring peace to both lands. The king wants Tristan to escort Isolde to Cornwall. Torn, Tristan does as his king requests and travels to Ireland to bring back the future Queen.<br /><br />Worried about the strength of the match, the Queen of Ireland gives Isolde's lady-in-waiting a potion to be given to Isolde and the King the night of their wedding, \\"A drink to make her love her husband and forget the man of her heart.\\" Of course it doesn't go that way because destiny is stronger than any potion. The concoction is mistakenly drunk by Isolde and Tristan and reinforces their love for one another. As if their love wasn't strong enough. Their passion is consummated.<br /><br />You may be thinking I'm giving too much away but I'm not. The story is predictable even for someone who isn't familiar with the tale. I was expecting so much more from this title. The romantic scenes were fluff. The first love scene between Isolde and Tristan was meant to be enchanting and mesmerizing but it came off as laughable. I cringed. I didn't feel the strength of their love but was told about it excessively.<br /><br />The omnipresent point-of-view was confusing most of the time. There was no way of deciphering the changes of POV until well into the paragraph. Reading was slowed down mostly because I had to figure out what head I was in. For a book titled Isolde it seemed to spend a lot of time in other people's heads and took a lot longer to read than it should have.<br /><br />There is an off shoot story about Arthur, Guenevere and the paternity of a young boy that was distracting and provided no fodder for the Isolde storyline other than to show everyone knew everyone else and were friends.<br /><br />Isolde opens with a diagram of the family trees of Cornwall, Lyonesse and Pendragon followed by a crude map depicting the kingdoms. Other helpful appendixes include a brief description of the characters, lists of places with brief descriptions, a comparison of the Celtic wheel of the year and the Christian wheel of the year.<br /><br />Overall, I guess you can tell I was disappointed with the story as a whole. I love stories from this era but this one did not work for me. I didn't love the characters and there was no real action until the last quarter of the book. Would I recommend it? If you're abig fan of the era, probably not. You've probably read better. If you're not, since it's a trilogy, I'd recommend going the library route or paperback.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]Would I recommend it?

He loves his family and his horse. His downfall is his burning temper. A temper so strong he accidentally killed his older brother.<br /><br />No amount of physical torture from his king or his fellow knights is enough to appease the guilt he feels. His father disowned him and his king lost patience with him. His greatest fear is that the rage in him will be released on someone else he adores. Fulk vows never to let his rage run rabid but it becomes increasingly difficult when he meets Jehanne.<br /><br />Jehanne, known to all as the Iron Maiden of Windemere is tall and fair but not your usual lady of silk and ribbons. Jehanne's father wanted a boy and all through her childhood she was treated as such, trained in the fine arts of combat, swords and bows instead of sewing and stitching.<br /><br />Jehanne spent her whole life trying to make her father proud with her skill as a knight but it hasn't worked. As a young woman he seeks to control and change her. She denies every man's affections because she knows it will lead to her succumbing to their rule as all women do. She would prefer never to leave Windemere, \\"a place she loved more than life.\\"<br /><br />Fulk fights in tourneys to raise money for his sister Celine's dowry. During his last battle he throws down his weapon, surrenders his horse and refuses to strike the last rider (Grimald). Doing so he becomes the prisoner of Lord Grimald. This leaves a sore impression of Fulk in Jehanne's eyes but also a curiosity.<br /><br />Grimald is one of the many men Jehanne's father would marry her off to if she would just cooperate. Before the tourney she embarrasses him in front of a crowd. To punish them both, Grimald orders Fulk to Windermere to take it by force with further instructions to make Jehanne his wife and produce an heir. Fulk agrees under order of the King but he wasn't planning on the strength and tenacity of one woman. Neither thinks they are worthy of another's love or that anyone is capable of loving them because of their perceived faults.<br /><br />Fulk and Jehanne have much in common even though they don't know it. Their training in knighthood, belief in honor and chivalry, their love of family and of horses as well as being at odds with their fathers. Both have unresolved conflicts external and internal.<br /><br />This story is what everyone thinks a Harlequin novel is. It has the typical gorgeous man and gorgeous woman who almost come together numerous times but something or someone keeps getting in their way until they work things out in the end. This story is different. It has a great plot; lots of deception and battles. It's not just a sexy novel although there were a couple scenes that were hot. There was an especially erotic wagon scene that made me say \\"Wow.\\" The journey is fun and I think it would make a great movie.<br /><br />The chemistry between Fulk and Jehanne and the plot to frame Fulk and trap Jehanne kept me reading. The supporting characters are charming. Especially the Scot, Malcolm MacNiall, Fulk's best friend (who would follow him to the ends of the earth and back even if it meant he'd lose both his arms in the process) and Fulk's frisky sister, Celine, the Wild Rose of Redware.<br /><br />There was a confusing start after the prologue but from there on in I was hooked. Lots of action, lots of tension. Mild breaks of comedy to lighten the load. This was definitely not what I expected from a Harlequin novel. I learned a lot about chivalry, knighthood and tournaments as well as the treatment of women during the 1200s.<br /><br />My only other complaint is with the title. Jehanne is a major character and I would have liked her to have been mentioned in there somewhere. Overall, an excellent read.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]thinks they are worthy of another's love or that anyone is capable of loving them because of their perceived faults.  <br /> <br />Fulk and Jehanne have much in common even though they don't know it.

US	34412866	R3PWH0SG2NWH7W	0060523034	383484197	I, Richard CD	Books	3	3	4	N	N	"Remember, I'll Always Love You" was excellent.	Elizabeth George is best known for her psychological crime novels. She has 15 books published. This is her first short story collection. Three of the five stories were previously published elsewhere.<br /><br />An introduction before each story informs the listener where the idea originated. I wonder if non-writers are interested in this type of information or would they sooner get to the story. From a writing perspective, I was interested but in some cases felt it took away from the story or gave too much away. Each story and introduction is narrated by Tony Award winner, Derek Jacobi.<br /><br />Exposure - is a rewrite of a previously published story, The Evidence Exposed. A history of British Architecture class at Cambridge University takes a field trip to Abinger Manor to do some research. They get more than they signed up for when one of them is murdered. There is a special appearance by Thomas Lindley, a character from one of George's novels. There are over 10 characters in this, the shortest story in this collection. With so many characters there is barely room for much else. It was more of a character study than a mystery. After listening three times, I still don't get the murder.<br /><br />The Surprise of His Life - The idea for this story came from a story that ran rampant in the media during the 1990s in which a man allegedly murdered his estranged wife and her lover. Intrigued by the story, George hypothesized the original act: what went through the murderer's mind, how he might have planned and executed the murder and what might have gone wrong.<br /><br />Douglas Armstrong is turning 55. He's married to a beautiful woman, Donna who's only 29 years old. A wealthy man, he wants for nothing. On a whim he visits a fortune teller who tells him he will have an \\"external surprise.\\" Douglas focuses on this phrase letting it get the best of his senses. He deciphers it to mean his wife is having an affair, despite the fortune teller's advice, \\"Trust is key. Trust is essential.\\"<br /><br />Douglas hires a PI to follow his wife around and becomes further disturbed when he is shown pictures of her and his brother in a secret meeting. He obsesses further over her unfaithfulness and sets out to plan her demise which does lead him into a shocking external surprise.<br /><br />This story is a wonderful example of how irrational our minds can be and how easy it is to assume we know the truth when in fact it is likely we do not have all the information. Like Exposure, you know there will be a murder before it occurs. I found this story predictable to the finale. No surprises here but good none the less.<br /><br />Good Fences Aren't Always Enough -came out of a \\"walking and hiking tour in Vermont\\" where she heard a tale about an eccentric woman. The title is from a poem by Robert Frost. This story reminded me a lot of \\"The Burbs\\" with Tom Hanks.<br /><br />An elderly woman moves into a family-oriented neighbourhood. She is a recluse, going out to work at the college and little else. Even her groceries are delivered. Willow decides to take it upon herself to \\"make nice\\" with the new neighbour. On route to the woman's front door, Willow discovers rats inhabit the ivy bushes that blanket the yard and house. A meeting is called amongst the neighbours and they decide an intervention is in order since the woman won't admit there's a rat problem. A bloody conclusion causes the woman to move out but not before Willow finds out why the woman befriended rats.<br /><br />I thought the story was over at this point and was happy with the outcome but then it picked up again after 8 months. Willow feels guilty about how the old woman was treated. She decides to track down the woman and apologize. Although the direction was shocking it was not surprising and was somewhat predictable. Still a good story.<br /><br />Remember, I'll Always Love You - Remember, I'll always love you, were the final words Eric Laudon said to his wife Charlie. She blamedherself for the death of her 42 year old husband because she didn't read the signs. During the weeks leading up to his death he had gotten a tattoo and a new Harley. He died a gruesome death, though we don't hear how at first but are led to surmise.<br /><br />Very few people come to the funeral, not even his parents or his daughter. Eric was estranged from his parents and hadn't talked to them in a long time. Charlie was told it was because of a hunting accident as a child in which he tripped and the gun went off killing his brother.<br /><br />Charlie decides to find his parents but she doesn't know much about them or where they live. She finds a receipt behind an old photograph, giving her a lead to start with. Through Charlie's research she begins to realize her husband had more secrets than she cared to believe and that she really didn't know the man she thought she loved. Instead of being a salesman for a pharmaceutical company she learns he is a molecular biologist, among other things. This is the best story in this collection, more suspenseful than the others. I was hooked and curious of the outcome throughout. This one is a winner.<br /><br />I, Richard - Malcolm Cousins is a 49 year old history teacher who gives tours of Bosworth Field. He's been having an affair with his childhood friend's wife for many years not because of the sex twice a week but to assure the legacy of his life work. Malcolm wants to be the first to show Richard the III didn't kill his nephews but tried to save them. Betsy is the key to prove this and he keeps this in mind every time he becomes repulsed by the thought of \\"bonking\\" her.<br /><br />I found the story about Richard III, the mystery of the princes' deaths and the night before the Battle of Bosworth Field more interesting than the characters. This story did more to spark an interest in Richard III. I would have rather heard more about him writing a letter on the Field of Bosworth the night before his death but still it was somewhat amusing and there is a satisfaction in the ending.<br /><br />Jacobi's voice is a little too relaxing. I'd be afraid to drive with this playing for fear of falling asleep and causing an accident. I often found his interpretation of character voices disturbing and confusing. An older woman in one story has the identical voice of a young girl in another.<br /><br />Following the stories is a Q & A with the author. I don't know who the interviewer is but her voice doesn't lend itself to listening to, especially after listening to Jacobi and in comparison to George's eloquent voice. A commentary answering her own questions would have been more enjoyable. There was no interaction between interviewer and interviewee. The interviewer was obviously reading questions that were meant to sound like dialogue.<br /><br />In closing, the last two stories were the best of this collection, although I would be hard press to put out the money for an audio version. If you enjoy rich character stories and want to learn more about how Elizabeth George generates her ideas then you will enjoy this. Also if you are a new writer interested in character study and process this would be interesting and useful. As part of your \\"must have\\" audio collection, I think not.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]o his wife Charlie.

Betsy is the key to prove this and he keeps this in mind every time he becomes repulsed by the thought of \\"bonking\\" her.  <br /> <br />I found the story about Richard III, the mystery of the princes' deaths and the night before the Battle of Bosworth Field more interesting than the characters. This story did more to spark an interest in Richard III. I would have rather heard more about him writing a letter on the Field of Bosworth the night before his death but still it was somewhat amusing and there is a satisfaction in the ending.  <br /> <br /> <br />Jacobi's voice is a little too relaxing. I'd be afraid to drive with this playing for fear of falling asleep and causing an accident. I often found his interpretation of character voices disturbing and confusing. An older woman in one story has the identical voice of a young girl in another.  <br /> <br />Following the stories is a Q & A with the author. I don't know who the interviewer is but her voice doesn't lend itself to listening to, especially after listening to Jacobi and in comparison to George's eloquent voice. A commentary answering her own questions would have been more enjoyable. There was no interaction between interviewer and interviewee. The interviewer was obviously reading questions that were meant to sound like dialogue.  <br /> <br />In closing, the last two stories were the best of this collection, although I would be hard press to put out the money for an audio version. If you enjoy rich character stories and want to learn more about how Elizabeth George generates her ideas then you will enjoy this. Also if you are a new writer interested in character study and process this would be interesting and useful. As part of your \\"must have\\" audio collection, I think not. <br /> <br />Review Originally Posted at [...]	2004-12-27

Its chapters boast topics such as garden design, container gardening, soil, feeding, pruning, pests, flowers and a gardening calendar. I had high hopes for this little book with a rather conceited title.<br /><br />After the intro's mini class on plant biology, the information presented are not hard and fast rules. The writers advise new gardeners to relax and be prepared to break some rules. One of the best chapters is Pruning. There are great diagrams and descriptions providing lots of useable understandable technical data for any newbie.<br /><br />EYNTKAG is loaded with lots of colourful, beautiful, sharp photographs. The problem is most of them are unlabelled. Most viewers, not just would-be-gardeners want to know what the plants are. The photos leave you wondering what they are, which is quite annoying especially for a new gardener.<br /><br />Another problem is the lack of common names. The botanical names are used in most if not all instances. If the book is to be for beginners then common names would have been helpful and possibly recognizable. One of the reasons sited later in the book, is the use of different common names for different regions. Regardless a familiar common name would provide better comprehension than an unrecognizable botanical name.<br /><br />For pests and diseases there is much talk of the bad bugs but nothing about what they look like. Many of the soil techniques illustrated aren't effective or doable with existing gardens. This book is truly for the green gardener starting from scratch. Even then, I'd be hard pressed to recommend this book over the Reader's Digest Illustrated Guide to Gardening. That being said there are useful bits of information buried in the text, but if you were trying to use this for a reference manual you might miss them.<br /><br />My greatest complaint is the lack of common sense in regard to offending the readers. I did not appreciate some of the comments like, \\"If you cut further away from the base of each main stem than 30cm, you're a big girl's blouse and your roses will look silly.\\" A big girl's blouse? As if that wasn't bad enough, a little later when discussing the pruning of nut trees: \\"A woman, a dog and a walnut tree, the more you beat them, the better they be.\\" Maybe it's the culture differences but the comments/sayings whatever you want to call them seem inappropriate, rude and lack common sense for this day and age.<br /><br />I guess if you made it this far you can tell EYNTKAG is not at the top of my gardening list. If you happen to pass it in your bookstore travels have a gander at the photos then buy Reader's Digest Illustrated Guide to Gardening. It's bigger and clunkier but filled to the rim with useful information.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]ng the readers.

One of the strongest ties binding women is the basis of Blue Blood, friendship. I know it's clich&eacute; but not even time and space can affect it. Women have a way of picking up where they left off, even after many years apart. Women don't forget as is the case of Andrea \\"Andy\\" Kendricks and Molly McBride. According to Andy, their friendship was so strong because they envied one another, \\"which sealed our friendship tighter than spit or blood.\\"<br /><br />They met in the awkwards of high school. Andrea from the prim and proper high society and Molly from a low income family. Molly was the private and posh Hockaday School's charity case, having won a scholarship to attend.<br /><br />After high school they shared a flat while attending an arts school in Columbia College. Andy finished and became a web designer but Molly ran off with the dark and mysterious Sebastian to Paris. Their relationship teetered off like most long distant friendships.<br /><br />After ten years of separation Andy gets a desperate call from Molly. She needs help pronto. She's been arrested for the murder of her boss and her son David is stranded at the neighbor's. Wow. So much for \\"Hello, how are you?\\" Andy doesn't think twice but jumps into action. Her first priority is getting Molly a lawyer. Who better to enlist a lawyer than her socialite extraordinaire mother, Cissy. The fact she'll owe her mother big time doesn't stop her from making the call. Her mother is hesitant to help at first but as the novel progresses it's easy to see she's having fun with her daughter.<br /><br />As I mentioned, Cissy is quite the socialite. Her full-time job is volunteering for causes and trying to get Andrea married, much to Andrea's chagrin. She discourages Andy's escapades but she is always there to provide money, a ride, a phone call to a high ranking member of society or to take in Molly's son David.<br /><br />With the lawyer and sitter taken care of Andy has time to get down to business. Clearing Molly's name. Why? Because the police have already decided Molly's the criminal. All evidence points to her. Andy doesn't believe it for a second and sets out to find the real killer by going undercover at Molly's place of employment. Wait for it...as a waitress at \\"Jugs\\". That alone was a hilarity.<br /><br />Susan McBride has created interesting characters that are easy to love (like the shy lawyer hired to help Molly) and a mystery that keeps you guessing until the final chapter. Blue Blood begins with a prologue introducing Molly seconds before her slimy boss corners her after hours. Once you start reading you'll want to know more.<br /><br />What impressed me the most about this Chic Lit mystery was the story wasn't lost amongst \\"poor me\\" dialogue and a whole lot of hot and heavy side relationships with constant interruptions. The story focuses on the mystery, the friendships (new and old) and family. \\"Blue Blood\\" is really about solving the mystery with mild comic relief in between. Blonde moments ensue but not to the detriment of the story. They're more of an interesting sidebar than a distraction.<br /><br />Andy is a role model for young girls and women. She's educated, loyal and willing to try any thing once as she follows her dreams. She's a no regrets kind of gal. Blue Blood is the first in \\"a debutant dropout mystery\\" and I'm looking forward to the next Nancy Drew moment Andy rushes into.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]ready decided Molly's the criminal.

He and girlfriend (a fellow teacher), Sarah Bracknell, expect to spend the rest of their lives together - but there are no picket fences in Johnny and Sarah's future.<br /><br />Johnny drops a food-poisoned Sarah off at home after a date at the fair then jumps into a taxi. Johnny never makes it home; his taxi hits a car head on, throwing him through the windshield into a coma. He doesn't open his eyes again for fifty-five months.<br /><br />Upon awakening he grabs the nurse at his bedside out of reflex. He reassures her, her son will be all right. Later the nurse come back to thank Johnny for letting her know. She had been worried about a medical procedure he was to undergo.<br /><br />The area of Johnny's brain that was cracked when he was a child has become a cavern with this second accident. He sees and feels things deeply, so much sothat it is like he is participating in them. Johnny can see the past, present and future of anyone he touches. These visions begin as flashes then build in intensity as his body recovers from its extended sleep.<br /><br />An unused area of the brain was stirred when Johnny's head made contact with the ice and awakened when his head went through the windshield. It is also the area where Johnny says again and again that the hidden information that he can't see lies, along with the things he has forgotten. He calls this awakened area \\"The Dead Zone.\\"<br /><br />The Dead Zone is the second King novel I have read and so far they are not what I expected them to be. They are chilling, but not because of some ghoulish content. They are scary because of the human quotient.<br /><br />Johnny's character is likeable; like most people he just wants to live his life and do the right thing. After Johnny leaves the hospital he finds it increasingly hard to just live his life. He is bombarded by lost souls looking for answers: where is my long lost brother, mother, husband, dog. Reporters hound him looking for proof he is real - or fake.<br /><br />Johnny's Jekyll and Hyde transformation from trance to waking world scares everyone he comes in contact with.. He despises the looks of horror he gets when he comes out of a trance. He feels isolated and believes his psychic gift is a nightmare. As the visions become more pronounced he distances himself from the few friends and family he has.<br /><br />Despite his forced seclusion the heartaches continue. Johnny visits his mother on her deathbed. The final words of wisdom from mother to son are \\"Do your duty, John.\\" Before she dies he gives in and promises what she asks. His mother's words weigh heavily on him throughout the remainder of the book.<br /><br />He lands a tutoring job and after months of mentoring , Johnny begins to believe that his true gift is teaching. Satisfaction and life purpose feel within his reach.<br /><br />This all changes the day he shakes hands with Greg Stillson, a budding politician. Stillson and the horrific images he witnessed never seem to leave Johnny's mind. He begins to keep meticulous journals on Stillson with his own thoughts lining the margins. One of the nagging thoughts that follow Johnny is whether he should do something or let it be.<br /><br />In Johnny's mind Stillson is reminiscent of Hitler. He begins to ask himself and others \\"What would you do if you could go back in time and have the opportunity to kill Hitler, would you do it?\\" In the answers of others, Johnny hopes to find alternatives to what he knows he must do. After much agonizing he decides that his only option is to assassinate Stillson, but from the beginning we know that things don't go according to plan.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier King is not ghoulish, but he is graphic. I found his images of a dog being brutally kicked to death and the antics of a serial killer unsettling. That being said, I can't imagine another way he could have bestowed the integrity of the characters on the reader.<br /><br />All of King's characters are rich and detailed. Enough information is given to set the tone of the character without being buried in description. They are people we have met and people that we know. King's imagery feels real from beginning to end leaving the reader with a sense of inclusion.<br /><br />I find his books not only entertaining but educational. The Dead Zone is 24 years old and still fits in with what is going on in our society. King's writing is laced with ethical, political and religious issues, never getting in the way of the story. His humourous sarcasm for society is everywhere and despite the content of the story I found myself chuckling. King is unafraid of the questions and provides the reader with his (or his characters) interpretation of the answers. It is well worth the read.<br /><br />[...]on, but from the beginning we know that things don't go according to plan. <br /> <br />As mentioned earlier King is not ghoulish, but he is graphic.

Or how they deal with rejection? Or maybe their personal writing rituals? \\"Bylines\\" lets you see the perspectives of 53 other writers. While providing you with a way to learn about writers and the writing life, it is also a month at a glance and weekly calendar.<br /><br />\\"May your words be profound more often than profane, clever more often than clich&eacute;d, in print more often than in your computer.\\" Those are the words and wishes from publisher, Linda Hagen Miller, for established and aspiring writers. An excellent way to start off this little book of wisdom.<br /><br />The first section is the monthly calendar. One month to a page with a generous notes section underneath. Following this is the weekly calendar with a byline opposite each page. Each byline is divided in two. The first part is a writing sample about their writing life; the second is a short bio and some kind of contact info, be it email or website URL. An accompanying black and white photo of the writer helps fit a face to the words. Every manner of writer is involved in this calendar. Poet, novelist, short story, freelancer. Every week provides a new outlook into the world of writing and a little bit of inspiration to start off your week.<br /><br />Writers can draw inspiration from the likes of Andrew Bill, \\"That pen in your hand is a magic wand and we writers are magicians with spells to tell.\\" The wealth of information doesn't end with the few lines here but continues with links to the writers' website and further resources. There seems to be many writers from Washington. I'd would have liked to see a wider range of locals.<br /><br />In the weekly calendar, birthdays and anniversaries of writers are in the margins: January 25, Virginia Woolf 1882-1941 and April 14, Maya Angelou 1928- just to name a few. Opposite this are the American Holidays. These are small so as not to impede with the writing space.<br /><br />\\"Bylines\\" is an excellent calendar for marking daily writing tasks or as a mini daily journal of your writing life.

It is not necessary to read 1916 and 1921 to follow 1949, although it might help when reference is made to significant events from previous periods, especially if you have little knowledge of Irish history.<br /><br />1949 picks up approximately two years after the Irish Civil War. Red haired, blued eyed Ursula Jervis Halloran is 16 years of age and riding her horse Saoirse (Irish for 'Freedom') in Clare, Ireland, where she grew up on a farm with her father Ned (lead character 1916) and his Aunt Norah. She has received a letter from her pseudo-uncle Henry Mooney (lead character 1921) beckoning her to visit him and his wife Ella in Dublin. Against her fathers wishes she disappears to Dublin without a word to anyone.<br /><br />When Ursula returns to the farm she informs her family she is going away to school in Switzerland, thanks to Ella's kind gift. Ned forbids it but she reminds him she is only his foster child and that she will do as she pleases, a path she follows throughout her life. Despite being adopted she has a strong bond with Ned and is deeply hurt by his anger. She leaves with business left unfinished between them.<br /><br />On arrival in Switzerland, she learns it is finishing school, much to her chagrin. Being of beauty and great personality she nevertheless quickly befriends the upper crust whom she continues to correspond with after she leaves at age 18. She returns to an impoverished Ireland with its strong views on religion and politics.<br /><br />Llywelyn is successful in painting the life of Ursula, a working class woman in a country trying to free itself from \\"foreign domination.\\" With each chapter Llywelyn brings the reader into the fold to watch a girl blossom into a woman. She is strong willed from the beginning. In a society where women are to be seen and not heard Ursula stands on her own two feet in full sun, determined to make it on her own. She does not let anyone push her into the shadows of male servitude. Llywelyn has created a memorable role model for women.<br /><br />Ursula was not without her own role models. Constance Markievicz' who encouraged her to be independent, choose her own path and only trust in herself for courage and honesty. This is true to Ursula's code to life.<br /><br />Ursula is reminded that she is just a woman at every opportunity but she doesn't allow it to sway her own views and desires. While other women's interests revolve around hair and beauty products, Ursula cultivates her strong feminine and political views. Her contacts, interest in politics and occurrences abroad land her a job at the 2RN Radio Station. She is not permitted to broadcast as \\"Only the male voice is really suitable.\\" Her schooling, meticulous letter writing to Henry, and to her acquaintances abroad, contribute to her success at 2RN and later with the League of Nations in Geneva. To work women had to be single or widowed, otherwise they were told to stay home with their children. Ursula vowed never to marry but that didn't stop the love triangle formation between traditional Irishman Finbar Cassidy and extravagant Englishman Lewis Baines.<br /><br />1949 contains plenty of Irish politics as well as British propaganda, and covers the emergence of Hitler and the Second World War from an Irish perspective that is just as horrifying as all others. Llywelyn doesn't focus on the Catholic Church's impact on Irish society like other authors have in the past but its presence is clear. Politics and freedom from state are crucial. Llywelyn's characters are not idle bodies but great thinkers.<br /><br />Tension mounts as the war hits closer to Ursula, affecting her and the people she holds dear. 1949 is not all doom and gloom. Morgan's wit is seen throughout in subtle glimpses as are tenderness, sexual fire and intense anger. One of my favourites is her mention of the \\"traditional Irish savings bank: under the mattress.\\"<br /><br />You can expect to learn a few Irish words like goster (chat; small talk) and seisiun (traditional music session) or learn of Irish traditions like keening (an \\"eerie singsong cadence, and unearthly wail\\" by women for the dead.)<br /><br />Passages of Ursula's life are entwined with passages of Ireland's history. There are large patches without dialogue and I often felt I was getting a history lesson rather than reading a novel but this was fleeting.<br /><br />There is a \\"Dramatis Personae\\" of fictional and historical characters in the first few pages. Another nice feature is the historical date markers. You are never without a doubt as to the timeline. Research and sources appear in the back. Not having grown up in the confines of Ireland's history I found it hard to keep the different groups and parties straight. It would have been nice to have a break down of each party, what they represented, length of existence etc... to refer to. The chapters are short, making it a great book for people on the move with limited time.<br /><br />Llywelyn finishes this story with the inauguration of the Republic of Ireland on April 18th 1949. There are no loose ends but possibilities exist to gently tug the reader into the next book. I look forward to reading about the period leading up to 1972.<br /><br />[...]Irish words like goster (chat; small talk) and seisiun (traditional music session) or learn of Irish traditions like keening (an \\"eerie singsong cadence, and unearthly wail\\" by women for the dead.)

It's small in size, only 5\\"x7\\", with a coil binding that makes it easy to fold back or lay flat. One of the best physical features is the plastic front and back cover protectors. I was very excited by this and thought \\"This is going to be a great cookbook.\\"<br /><br />Flipping through the pages I came to a different conclusion: that I wasn't going to like anything. This was due to the first three recipes being virtually the same other than one ingredient. I felt cheated by the title.<br />These could have fallen under one recipe with a note for variations. Continuing on it amazed me how little text was in this book for ingredients and for directions. I put the book aside for a week due to lack of<br />interest.<br /><br />A couple weeks ago, I decided the least I could do was give some of the recipes a try before I wrote a review. After reading thus far I think you will be surprised with the results, I know I was.<br /><br />Out of the 18 recipes I tried, only one received a rating below 6. I rated each recipe according to my standards. The highest rating was 7. Each recipe was rated for the following: availability of ingredients, clarity of instructions, ease of prep, husband factor, taste, reheatabity, and freezability. One point is awarded for each area. Any area that didn't pass is in brackets. Anything with an extra number was doubly good in the taste category.<br /><br />Quick Stew-6 (doesn't reheat well from freezer)<br />Tortilla Soup-8<br />Broccoli Cheese Soup-8<br />Beef & Mushrooms-7<br />Lasagne-8<br />Sweet and Sour Beef-6 (bland)<br />Shepherd's Pie-7<br />Chicken & Rice Casserole-7<br />Scalloped Chicken-8 (used with Cajun chicken)<br />Whole Cranberry Chicken-8 (better with dark meat)<br />Tater-tot casserole-8<br />Lemonade chicken-5 (husband factor, taste)<br />Orange chicken-6<br />Polynesian pork chops-7<br />Ham & potatoes-7<br />Triple rich chocolate cake-9 (gave an extra point for taste. Mmmm)<br />Pineapple upside-down cake-7<br /><br />A lot of the recipes involved a lot of pre-packaged items but I'd expect the cook would have the common sense not to live off the recipes in this cookbook. They are not for everyday use but for the busy homemaker on a tight schedule. Some of the recipes are high in fat content but substitutions could be easily made. If you are rushed for time or just feeling lazy this little book is a time saver. The greatest surprise was being able to put a cake mix in the slowcooker. Who knew? The intro has two pages of helpful hints if you haven't used a slowcooker before.  The book is sectioned into: Beverages (which I think is a worthless section), Dips & Fondues, Soups & Stews, Beef, Chicken, Pork and Desserts.<br /><br />You'll notice I didn't try anything from the beverage, and dips and fondues section.  My living arrangements don't warrant making a crock pot full of hot chocolate or dip. With any cookbook people generally don't use over half of the recipes. I tried 1/3 of the recipes and would use all but one of them again<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at [...]lot of pre-packaged items but I'd expect the cook would have the common sense not to live off the recipes in this cookbook.

You would think that being a woman would put you at the top of the list of knowing about ourselves. That just isn't the case. There is a lot we don't know about ourselves. Some we just assume, others we just try not to think about.<br /><br />Natalie Angier has thought about them, researched them and comprised a book of them in \\"Woman: An intimate geography.\\" Angier, a Pulitzer Prize Award winner has numerous books under her belt. She's also a regular writer for the New York Times science column.<br /><br />In \\"Woman\\", Angier has divided the body into different areas where she goes into intimate detail. Her discussions include but are not limited to: the female egg, chromosomes, the uterus, menstruating, the clitoris, breasts, breast milk, ovaries, hormones (especially estrogen), female relationships, female aggression, muscles, and psychology. Everything you could think of relating to a woman and maybe some you haven't. To keep things in perspective she hasn't completely left out the men.<br /><br />This has been an interesting read from beginning to end. In some areas the text is way over my head but the book is understandable and provides reams of data that I didn't know about myself and women in general. It also reinforced some things I did know. On a personal note, I learned there is such a great variance in breasts and menstrual bleeding that I'm normal after all. According to Angier, Hornet talk and \\"mastering words and barbed insults are an essential task of childhood.\\" And here I thought we were just surrounded by little bitches.<br /><br />\\"We are all women with many pasts. We are old primates and neohominids. We feel drawn toward other women, we feel a need to explain ourselves to them and to impress them, and we run away from women, we disavow them, or we keep them around only until the real thing comes along. We can do each other mischief, even violence, but we can do each other good as well. Both options are open to us, in the plastic opportunistic flow chart of our strategies and choices,\\" says Angier.<br /><br />I believe she's given us a better vessel with which to understand why we are the way we are and the many different forms of whom and what we are. She is positive. She is honest. No aspect of what she says makes any female form inadequate and unappreciated. Her book is a successful delivery of who and what we are and what we have the potential to become.<br /><br />\\"An Intimate Geography\\" would be of interest to young ladies or senior citizens. We're never too old to learn about our bodies. It provides a framework for discussion with other women and helps to put us at ease with one another and ourselves. The 367 pages are well-worth the time.tions are open to us, in the plastic opportunistic flow chart of our strategies and choices,\\" says Angier.  <br /> <br />I believe she's given us a better vessel with which to understand why we are the way we are and the many different forms of whom and what we are.

US	34412866	R3HL31Y64IGHPB	1582344280	736327466	The Fat Girl's Guide to Life	Books	4	7	7	N	N	doesn't promise any cures for being fat	Wendy Shanker has written for national women's magazines, she's hosted fashion shows, she's traveled far and wide to gather the data she's compiled for the \\"The Fat Girl's Guide to Life.\\" Ok, maybe not \\"far and wide\\" but she has first hand experience. She's 32 years old and she has been fat most of her life. Now she's putting that experience to good use.<br /><br />Being a fat girl myself, I was curious what Shanker had to say. Shanker's style is blunt and to the point. She says it like it is (or at least as she sees it) with a little bit of sarcastic sometimes comedic twist. She isn't degrading like most fat humourists. She is respectful but truthful. Her raw humour made it easy to read. But this book definitely isn't all about humour. It's about being fat in a media infested world.<br /><br />Shanker's book is not what I'd call a step by step guide but a \\"get real\\" guide. It's time to admit you're \\"Fat\\" and then get on with it...Life. Stop dwelling on how you don't have Cameron Diaz's thighs and go have some fun.<br /><br />In the introduction, Shanker doesn't promise any cures for being fat (there are enough of those claiming that already) or for improving your self-esteem. She maintains that \\"I'm not one hundred percent self-satisfied but I'm trying; I'm closer.\\" After years of self torture she can say \\"I know there's nothing wrong with me mentally and physically.\\"<br /><br />Shanker doesn't think we should be afraid to use the word \\"Fat\\" to describe ourselves (for any non-fat person out there: we can call ourselves fat but no one else can). \\"You're here, you're fat, get use to that!\\" she says. She also believes in standing up for ourselves when society is rude. Being an advocate for ourselves is also a necessity. She suggests, if a medical professional says something unprofessional then let them know even if you have to write a letter so they don't do it to the next fat person.<br /><br />She touches on self loathing, binging, the diet industry and the media industry without beating the topics to death. Even Oprah isn't safe from her prying eyes and stinging wit. Everything is fair game for conversation even her lack of bowel movements. She is bold, fearlessly attacking and industry of \\"body image\\".<br /><br />Weight loss programs? Well she can't say enough about them. I like how she compared them to every other product we buy. It is the only product we buy in which we blame ourselves if it doesn't work. She reviews how weight loss companies and fast food chains have invaded our lives, lifestyles and bank accounts. She attacks Weight Watchers head on and how they are designed to keep us coming back. She's the Michael Moore of the fat world.<br /><br />Instead of wasting money on dieting schemes that don't work for the average person she recommends the common sense approach: Stop dieting, eat healthy and exercise. Eat what you want as long as you eat healthy and exercise MOST of the time. She offers no diet plans or exercise routines. \\"We are responsible for our own decisions about our bodies,\\" she says.<br /><br />Obviously, Shanker is just one more opinion in the sea but at least hers floats on an inner tube of common sense. I love this woman! I love the book! I could relate to most of what she said and felt such a relief in reading it. I am no longer alone. I found myself reading sections over again (I won't say which ones because that's personal to my own melodrama and you'll probably have your own favourites). Numerous times I felt she was looking into my head. Yikes! I don't even want to be there half the time.<br /><br />This book isn't just for fat people. It's for the people who love fat people, date fat people, are friends with fat people and for people who just don't understand fat people (a.k.a. the \\"thin\\" people).<br /><br />Shanker is here to let the world know that fat people \\"aren't all jolly, we aren't asexual, we aren't lazy, and we aren't all depressos zoning out in front of the TV sets with ice cream melting down our chins.\\" She wants us all to be able to respect ourselves, our bodies and be able to handle the rude people who aren't comfortable enough in their own lives that they have to try to make someone else unhappy.<br /><br />Through her personal experience and empowering dialogue I think she's setting an example. I'm looking forward to her next book. Perhaps \\"The Fat Girl's Guide to Life: Part II.\\"sets with ice cream melting down our chins.\\" She wants us all to be able to respect ourselves, our bodies and be able to handle the rude people who aren't comfortable enough in their own lives that they have to try to make someone else unhappy. <br /> <br />Through her personal experience and empowering dialogue I think she's setting an example.

US	34412866	RI8GNZ1183JUE	006098824X	956920947	Getting Over It	Books	3	4	4	N	N	characters both easy to love and easy to hate	Twenty-six year old Helen Gayle Bradshaw leads a fairly normal life for a young British girl. She shares a flat with a guy she has adored since forever and her equally adoring cat (as adoring as a cat can be), Fatboy. She's in a long term relationship. She's an assistant for an editor from hell (but not really) by day and by night she gets [drunk] with her fun-loving friends Lizzy, Tina and Luke.<br /><br />Suddenly her world is turned upside down. She breaks up with her emotionally abusive boyfriend but continues to have second thoughts even though she knows he's cheated on her on at least two occasions. Worse still her father dies sending her into a series of events she would probably never relive. Now she's trying to keep her wits about her and keep her mom from ending up beside her father all while trying to find new love or lose it or maybe find it.<br /><br />This story wasn't what I expected. Cosmopolitan compared it to Bridget Jones but this book is really about loss. It isn't about the laughs and it isn't about finding someone to spend the rest of your life with. It's about the deepest and most painful change anyone can go through: the death of a loved one and getting over it. As well, Helen is at an age where she has to decide to give up the ghost and grow up. Throughout you can see her struggle as she matures into a woman she can be proud of.<br /><br />\\"Getting Over It\\" isn't all doom and gloom. It's finely laced with funny interludes with her neurotic controlling mother, a friend who could learn the finer points of regular hygiene, a fashionista, a boss with attitude and the delicious Tom. I cannot leave out Fatboy, a vengeful peeing cat with an err for inappropriate flatulence. Some parts were piss your pants funny and to say anymore would ruin the laughs for you.<br /><br />The only problem I had was warming up to the pseudo diary format. The first person account with an obvious British sound to it that was cumbersome in the beginning for this Canadian. Once I got over it I was able to mesh with the characters. It would have been nice to have a mini-dictionary of terms in the back. [Some were] obvious as we've probably heard it in every British movie in the last fifteen years but there were others that escape me. They aren't excessive but enough to slow reading and make you wonder.<br /><br />Maxted is excellent at weaving characters both easy to love and easy to hate. If you like a well-rounded novel that will make you laugh, cry, angry, cringe and at times think (or if you're in the right age group reminisce) then you'll enjoy \\"Getting Over It\\". I know I loved it.<br /><br />Review Originally Posted at http:largeandlovely.bellaonline.come to mesh with the characters. It would have been nice to have a mini-dictionary of terms in the back.

Elegance is the tell-all bio of a fictional character named Louise Canova. She's an American girl from Pittsburgh living with her gay husband in London. To say Louise is plain is an understatement. Louise is practically invisible.<br /><br />Louise, a 32 year old ticket agent in a theatre playhouse, comes to a crossroad. A series of events beginning with a scrawny friend of her mother-in-law inquiring about her pregnancy (she's not pregnant!) starts Louise on a course for change. She finds a book titled Elegance in a second-hand bookstore she frequents. The book, written in the 1940's by Genevieve Dariaux (also a fictional character), becomes a bible of sorts, a pseudo Dr. Phil treatment plan.<br /><br />Each chapter of Elegance a.k.a. therapy session brings up a past event or interaction Louise relives with the fresh eyes of the person she's become. She creates to-do lists that she takes to the extreme but somehow manages to find a happy medium. Her journey though, is the kicker.<br /><br />There are a host of amusing supporting characters - like her therapist whom Louise has been seeing since she was first married. Her therapist, known as Mrs. P. is a middle age German lady who lacks any fashion sense and seems more dependent on Louise than Louise is on her.<br /><br />Tessaro has written a charming book. She takes the reader through a section of Louise's life and from her perspective laughing and crying are inevitable. Even though Louise is likeable, there were times I wished I could slap her. Throughout I kept thinking things couldn't possibly get any worse. They did. Louise has a unique way of surviving, though, and really that's all any of us want to do. Survive. By the end, I cared what happened to her. Although the book is written from a fictional standpoint there are nuggets of wisdom within that we know, but sometimes forget. Like the importance of friendship is in the quality and not the quantity.<br /><br />With Ally McBeal-esque imagery, Tessaro drives home Louise's personality. Showing a side we can relate to but would never let on about. One of my favourite scenes is when she enters a Starbucks. She stands in line to place an order. She wants to \\"punch through the glass case and grab the whole cake and run howling into the street with it like a creature from a Hammer horror film,\\" but instead she orders a double espresso with no sugar.<br /><br />Louise learns to embrace change. She changes her cohabitation, her image, her friends, her residence and her job. She learns change isn't all that bad, and it doesn't affect the person she is, in fact it enhances it.<br /><br />Elegance is a fun ride. I hope Kathleen Tessaro will produce more books along this line. I would love to see a sequel with this character along with her quirky friends.<br /><br />I was entertained. I laughed, I cried, I cringed. Did I mention I laughed? I will never think of a potato in the same way again, (You'll have to read the book to find out what I'm talking about).<br /><br />[...]e we can relate to but would never let on about.
