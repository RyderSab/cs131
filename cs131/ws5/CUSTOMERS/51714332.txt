Dr. Harry Turtledove is a specialist in writing alternative history, and this somewhat scary and horrifying book is one of his best.<br /><br />Imagine, (Dr. Turtledove asks) that Nazi Germany has won WWII and you are one of the few surviving Jewish families left in Germany.  And further imagine that following Poe's \\"Purloined Letter\\" doctrine, (the best place to hide something is in plain sight) you are actually working for the German government!  That is the basic premise behind this work.<br /><br />Both longtime and casual readers of Turtledove often critcized him for returning over the same ground over and over, (which in all honesty, can be annoying...) but here, that same \\"flaw\\" works.  Why?  Because a Jew hiding and living in the Third Reich would HAVE to constantly remind himself of the possible consequences of his (or her) most innocent action.  Imagine living like that.  One simple mistake and you and your entire family is dead. Dr. Turtledove makes you FEEL the pressure on each page.<br /><br />I don't agree with him at all on the notion of telling the children who they really are at age 10.  From my own expernice with children, that would be far too young to trust a child to keep a secret of this magnitude.  But it doesn't detract that much from the book, (I admit reading that part and thinking, \\"what the hell is he thinking about?\\") And I thought the part of the woman who doesn't succeed in having an affair with the hero badly done, but nonetheless, I award this one 5 stars because the premise is outstanding and Harry Turtledove does such a masterful job of pulling it off.<br /><br />Dr. Turtledove is a truly excellent writer when he chooses to put forth the effort, and this novel is a fine example of that.	2005-09-03

Before I really get into to this, one mild word of warning.  In the past couple of years, I have become friends with noted dog trainer Sarah Wilson, who along with her husband, Brian Kilcommons, have written several dog books, including the one I consider the current reigning and undisputed champ of the \\"how to pick your dog\\" genre, \\"Paws To Consider\\"...it may be worth your while to keep that in mind as you read this...and with that in mind, how does Bash Dibra's \\"Your Dream Dog\\" stack up?<br />Pretty well actually.  Mr. Dibra is well-known dog trainer himself, and to be honest about it, his book does offer a couple of advantages over \\"Paws\\" (although it feels slightly treasonous to me to say that...)To begin with, his breed listing contains more breeds than does \\"Paws\\" (over 160 compared to 147) and some may also find his straight alphabetical listing easier to use than the by lifestyle approach used by Brian and Sarah.  Okay, no more comparisons to \\"Paws\\" or mentioning of other dog trainers...<br />Mr. Dibra does all dog lovers a favor by listing in his dog \\"groups\\" (or types in this case) the most common of all breeds/types/ call it what you will...the common everyday mutt.  And along those lines he echoes the feelings of other noted \\"dog people\\" that the potential new dog owner not be fooled by the current fad of matching one breed or another to a poodle, calling it a \\"something-a-poo\\" (cockapoo, pekeapoo, whatever) and billing it as a new breed.  They not.  Period.  Cute, yes, adorable without a doubt, but folks, these guys are just plain mutts.  Don't pay pure breed prices for a mix.<br />\\"Your Dream Dog\\" also deserves applause for mentioning that your dream dog maybe one of those unfortunates abandoned at the shelter.  Yes you can get pure breds there too, and the number of dogs (and cats) that are killed each year in this country is nothing short of criminal.<br />More credit must be given to Mr. Dibra for including the \\"puppy temperment test\\", a more or less standard test used to be the right puppy for you out of a liter, mentioned in dog books by..er...other dog book authors. (See? No names.)<br />Other pluses includ what to have ready when your new puppy comes home, something so many of us forget, until you raise a frantic shout \\"Oh my god, I forgot to get...(what?\\")  He also lists activties that you can share with your dog, (and there are a lot of them) and the fact that your dream puppy may be and need not be a puppy at all.  Adult dogs can and do bond to their new owners.  Our own West Highland White Terrier( ada \\"Westie), Sally, was five when we got her, and it has been a great match-up.  <br />So what is wrong with the book?  Well, a few things, minor for the most part.  The brief breed description are a little too brief, especially in regard to the diseases that various breeds are subject too.  Mitral Valve Disorder is listed as a problem for the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, with no mention that this problem is a real killer in these cute little fellows. The national breed assocation for the Cavvy estimates that as many as 50% of the dogs may have this.  Breeders are working hard on curing the problem, but starting out so far behind is real handicap.  Skin allegeies are real problem, especially in summer for Westies and their owners, but this is not even mentioned in the breed description, although it is in the appendixes dealing with medical problems, but the potential owner of these dogs would not know that without specifally looking for it.<br />Which brings me to what I think is the major flaw in \\"Your Dream Dog.\\"  There is no index.  I was actually more than a little surprised to see that, since this is a book intended to be used, and used hard.  It's not fair to blame Mr. Dibra for this of course, but someone sure dropped the ball here.<br />Still the book is a worthwhile additon to a dog-lovers library.  \\"Your Dream Dog\\" doesn't merely lecture, it teaches.  All dog trainers, breeders what have you, will agree that research in arugably the most important of the first steps in getting your canine companion and this book will be a good one to begin your search.<br />Would have given it a 5, but since, you know, there ain't no-stinking-index, I took away a point, (actually a half, but Amazon won't let me do that) for a score of 4 1/2	2003-08-01

This is an unusual recommendation from me, for I have never read one of Mr. King's novels. (His work is typically in a genre I avoid) but if \\"On Writing\\" is typical of his work, I may have to try a couple of his books.  Even if you hate King's books, his advice is impossible to ignore, because it is coming from a man who has sold millions of books, so obviously he knows what he is talking about.  About half this book is an autobiography, in which King talks about his life, his problems with alcohol and drugs, and the debt he owes to his wife (and fellow novelist) Tabitha,('Tabby' as he refers to her.)  This takes roughly half the book, and his advice on writing is the other half.(The final chapters deal with his almost fatal accident in '99...) The 'how to write' portion is something like 150 pages but King crams more useful info in those 150 pages than many books of this nature twice as long, and since he IS Stephen King, he makes it stick.  You also get an impression of man who, despite his success, still doesn't take himself too seriously, King defintely has a sense of humor...Wehn speaking of bad books, he says, \\"I should know.  After all I'm the author of \\"Maximum Overdrive.\\" (or words to that effect. the 'Overdrive' book apparently was not one of his better workds, as I said, I haven't read him..)If you want to write, or if you are a Stephen King fan who just wants to know more about your favorite author, you MUST have this book	2002-08-25

Books	3	2	2	N	N	good try, but not very good	The French and Indian War, doesn't get a lot of space in our history books, but it is one of pivotal events of US history.  Ms. Bittner writes in the acknowledgements of this book that it would not have been possible without Alan Eckerts \\"Wilderness Empire\\" but she fails to capture any of the tone of that book.  The single biggest problem, I feel, is that the characters seem to be mere sketches. I never cared about them, it never really mattered to me what really happened.I never not involved with them, and neither did I get any sense of the desperation and the grimness of the war on the frontier. She also uses the Iroqouis as 'The Big Bad Wolf' of the piece, (although there is no clear cut villian in the book...) but in truth, the Iroqouis League (six different tribes) were either allies of the British or at least neutral during the conflict.  Bittner does make an effort to avoid protraying the Indians as savages with no respect for human life, but even this rings a bit hollow...(perhaps this was her point since most of obseravtions take place through the eyes of 16 year old white captive, but it doesn't seem to come across)The French are all evil, with very little redeeming qualities and you read of a lot of the colonists thinking \\"one day we will throw England out too, and govern this land on our own\\" which was most defintely NOT a sentiment that was common in the 1750's...The book is rapidly paced and easy reading, but I honestly can't recommend it.  Perhaps as a romance novel, it's ok,but as a historical novel, forget it.  For GOOD F&I War novels, try the aforementioned Eckert, Kenneth Robert's classic \\"Northwest Passage, or Don Wright's diffcult to find \\"The Woodsman\\"...all are flawed in their own way, but come much closer than this one	2002-06-29

Historical re-enacting has been a part of my life for a very long time,and this book was one of the first guides I had.  And it is still one of the best for the newcomer to the hobby, despite being first published 21 years ago. Basic clothing, tents and tipis, camp behavior, the crafts of 'buckskinning' are all here. One minor criticism from me is that this volume, more so than the others in the series, concentrates on the Western Fur trade era, to the exclusion of the eastern frontiersman, but to be fair, when this book was published most of the interest in re-enacting was leaning more toward the 'mountain man' rather than the 'long hunter'.  Despite this, I highly recommend this book and all its companion volumes (8 total books...)for anyone interested in the wonderful hobby of historical re-enacting...	2002-04-30

I've been an avid Flashman fan since stumbling across the first book in the series waiting for the plane to take me home from Vietnam in 1970 and have eagerly awaited each new volume. This adventure gets 'only' four stars for two reasons: first of all, it is three seperate stories in one book, an unusual format for a Flashman book and two (and most damaging) the title story is just simply not up to the usual standards maintained by Fraser.  Don't get me wrong, it is not bad, by any means, it is just that regular readers of Flashman get spoiled by Fraser's ability to keep you interested and this one just does not quite measure up.  <BR>    The first two stories are very good without being particularly memorable, the first being the best of the book. Flashman deals with peace treaties, then in what is basically a repeat of the second Flashman book 'Royal Flash', finds himself kidnapped by the son of Count von Starnberg, (one of Flashy's more memorable villains)and is embroiled in a plot to assassinate the Kaiser. Telling more would give away to much of the plot, but it is worth reading.  The second story involves a almost unknown in this country Victorian scandal, and you find that Flashman's wife, the beautiful Elspeth playing a central role.  This is defintely enjoyable to Flashman regulars since Elspeth's usual roles are cameo's at best, but the scandal has little interst to Americans.  <BR>    I defintely recommend any of the Flashman books, but you haven't read Flashman yet, I wouldn't suggest you start with this one...(perhaps \\"Flashman and the Great Game\\" or \\"Flashman and the Dragon\\" would be the best starting point, but I think you miss a lot of the flavor if you don't read them all in order...)But do yourself a favor and check out Flashman...you won't be disappointed...	2002-04-30

What would have happened if the Persians had won at Salamis?  What if Alexander the Great had been killed in battle at the age of 21?  What if Charles Martel, aka \\"Charles the Hammer\\" had lost the battle of Tours, and Islam had become the domiant religion of Europe?  All these scenarios, and more, are presented here.  And yes, the ever popular \\"What if the South had won the Civil War?\\" is here too, but if this seems to be a too obivious selection, it is forgivable because that conflict was such a pivotal part of United States history.   The article that really struck me was the one dealing with how we won the Revolutionary War, and how close we came to losing...how, in fact, that we should have lost it, with the US becoming a 'southern' verison of Canada.  We came very close to remaining English as it was...or what of the Aztecs almost capturing Cortes?  If they had, the author of this piece suggests an westward expanding US might have run into a Native American Empire on its borders...What would have happened then?<br />\\"What If?\\" does two of the most important jobs a book has, it makes you learn and best of all, it makes you THINK!!

Easy...it's not long enough.  That is about it.  I guess it would have been nice to have some photos of some of the dogs mentioned, but oh well.  Brian Kilcommons and Sarah Wilson, two well known dog trainers relate some of their experiences, both with client dogs and their own.  The first story, involving a Jack Russell terrier that found a rather unique way to play with his tennis ball, had me laughing out loud. Brian's Rotweiler, Beau, conducting his own version of &quot;chemical warfare&quot; while waiting to go on at a talk show, the lady who was demonstrating to her dog how to go on the papers, Sarah dealing with a blizzard at their kennel, (Brian and Sarah are husband and wife as well as co-authors)while Brian is out of town.  The terrier that was chasing a rabbit in an eighth floor apartment, the Maltese that finally bit off a little more than it could chew, every story is terrfic.  Not all have happy endings, sadly, but every dog owner understands this.  These two have several &quot;must reads&quot; for dog owners out, (with a new one coming soon)and also operate &quot;GreatPets.com&quot; which is rapidly becoming the most popular pet site on the web, if it is not already.  There are two types of people who will like this book: Those who love dogs, and those who don't.  If you fit in either of those categories, check it out I seriously doubt you will be disappointed.	2001-07-10

John Jakes &quot;broke through&quot; with his &quot;Bicentennial Series&quot; aka &quot;The Kent Family Chronicles&quot; and cemented his place with his three volume Civil War series and returns to that conflict with this book.  Instead of concentrating on the soldiers, he follows the exploits of the spys and the behind the scene manuvering that went on during the War. The battles of the War are, as another reviewer said, mere footnotes in this narrative. (Not surprising as Jakes once stated that during his Civil War trilogy he had a note above his desk saying &quot;Not Gettsyburg again!&quot;) This book explores Jakes belief (correct in my opinion) that the other facets of the War are just as interesting as the battles. Several of the interesting footnote people of the era are here,Alan Pinkerton Lafeyette Baker, Rose Greenhow, and John Mosby, the famous &quot;Grey Ghost&quot; of the Confederacy.  Modern espionage had its birth during the Civil War and Jakes depicts that birth vividly.  It does drag a bit here and there, which is why &quot;only&quot; four stars, but well worth reading	2001-05-29

Wilbur Smith returns to the ancient Egypt of &quot;River God&quot; for this one.  Unlike &quot;River God&quot; this one is not told from the standpoint of the slave Tatia, but in the third person. Tatia, now a old man and the warlock of the title, is advisor to pharoah Mamose, the son of Queen Lotsris.  However both Mamose and his Hyskos rival are murdered through some complicated plots, (even a writer of Smiths caliber has trouble pulling this off, since Mamose most trusted advisor, and assasin, is a cousin to one of the hated Hyskos)  The two new &quot;false kings&quot; decide to cement their new union with interstate marriages and the plot becomes far more complicated from there.  As I said, even a master wordsmith such as Wilbur Smith has trouble keeping all this straight, let alone readable, but somehow he does it.  The rapid pacing that is the hallmark of a Smith novel is there, although it is a bit slower, action-wise, than is usual in one of his books.  (River God was also like this.)Any Wilbur Smith is worth reading, since at his worst, Smith is better than 90% of the other writers out there, and Warlock is far from his worst.  This book totally stands alone from &quot;River God&quot;, not being a sequel so much as another book using a few of the original characters. For what its worth, of the three &quot;Egypt books&quot; I would read them in the order they were written... &quot;River God&quot;, &quot;Seventh Scroll&quot; (which takes place in modern times oddly enough), and then &quot;Warlock&quot; since I think you will enjoy &quot;Scroll&quot; a lot more if you read it immediatly after &quot;River God&quot;.  (Those two are far more &quot;connected&quot; that &quot;River God&quot; and &quot;Warlock&quot; are.)  &quot;Warlock&quot; is an excellent Wilbur Smith, which in itself is reason enough to check it out.	2001-05-29

Meaning Kit Carson, his grandaughter, Margo, Skeeter Jackson and the rest of the residents of Time Terminal 86, and this time they have to deal with that unknown &quot;gentleman&quot; of Victorian England known as Jack the Ripper. May as well get a couple of flaws out of the way first...As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, this is in two parts, which is needless. The book would not have been absurdly large had it all been published as a single volume, so to actually complete the story, you'll need to go ahead and buy the second book &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot; as well. There is also some bad writing here in a place or two...a few run-on sentences that just go on and on, to the point you find yourself having to go back and reread the passage more than once to figure out what is meant.This is not really a criticism, but the authors obviously accept the James Maybrick Diary (published a few years ago as &quot;The Diary of Jack the Ripper&quot;) as geniune. There are some convincing arguements in favor of the diary, but just as many arguements, and just as compelling, that it is false. That said, what you are left with is a &quot;ripping' (lousy pun intended) good story. You have a crooked polictian (isn't this becoming just a bit of cliche character now?) with his own agenda, murdering anyone who gets in the way, including his own daugther, who manages to avoid the planned hit with the help of a mysterious private investigator, and flees down the Victorian England &quot;gate&quot; to escape the pursuing hit men, and guess who is waiting on the other side? Actually, the &quot;Whitechapel Murders&quot; forms a second plot, in which a team of investigators are trying to positivly ID the Ripper,but they are in for a big surprise when they do. A pretty good book, but you do have to have both of them...	2001-03-02

What it is about is using postive reinforcement for all training purposes. Postive reinforcement does not mean NEVER correcting the subject, but doing so in a postive way, mostly by rewarding correct behavior. Ms. Pryor shows, by using certain common situations, (kids making too much noise in the car on long trips, dog barking in the back yard all night, etc) how different methods would work or not work, and further adds other examples, with animals that are not usually thought of as &quot;trainable&quot;, how certain behaviors were be easily taught. The author is a big advocate of &quot;clicker training&quot; (as is Sarah Wilson, who I mentioned earlier) but even after reading the book, I really don't understand the &quot;why and how it works&quot; aspect of it, which is why only 4 stars, her explantion just doesn't seem clear enough for someone who is new to the concept. (If half star ratings were allowed, this book would have 4 and a half, since I consider this a minor flaw...) This is a wonderful book which should be on the bookshelf of everyone who does animal training, or for that matter, parents as well...	2001-02-21

Michael Hart rates those who,in his opinion, qualify as the 100 most influential people in history, not the greatest, or the smartest or the nicest, but the most influential.  Impossible to get agreement on, but before you dismiss Hart's rankings, you should read his reasons...Reading over the list of names, it is easy to say, &quot;Oh, that's nonsense!!

It is an interesting mental excerise to change his listing, then defend YOUR choice as clearly as Hart does, (and doing that is tougher than it sounds, by the way). Hart's book does exactly what a book of this nature should do, it makes us THINK and that fact alone qualifes it as an excellent book and one that should not be missed.....	2001-01-18

I've been meaning to write a review of &quot;Once An Eagle&quot; for some time, but being waaaaaayyyyyy behind in both my reading and reviewing, other things always seemed more pressing, but I can hold off on this one no longer. For my money, this one of the truly GREAT novels of our time. The war hero who hates war may be a cliche character, but Myers hero, Samuel Adam &quot;Sad Sam&quot; Damon, is no cliche, but one of the strongest characters in fiction.  From boyhood on a Midwestern farm in pre-WWI America to Indochina, Damon leads men, and leads them not by saying &quot;Forward men&quot;, but with the old infantry credo of &quot;Follow Me&quot;... yet despite his ability as an officer, he is always torn by his own doubts of that ability and by guilt for the deaths he feels he is responsible for. Damon stand as an example of the &quot;perfect officer&quot;, so of course he is required to be opposed by a perfect example of the non-perfect officer, the ambitous and ruthless Courtney Massengale, who is always at least one rank above Damon.  The battle scenes are horribly realistic, and helpness Damon feels, especially in one part when he realizes that he and his command have been betrayed by Massengale, and if he (Damon) can save any of his men, he must do so at the expense of his best friends life, involves the reader to a degree seldom seen in any novel. I have been told that &quot;Once An Eagle&quot; is required reading in the Marine Corps and the Army War College, as an example of all a officer should be, and if true, no book can serve better as a textbook for that than this work of fiction. It grabs you and refuses to let you go, ever. You won't read &quot;Once An  Eagle&quot; just once. It is truly deserving of being called &quot;One of the World's Great Novels&quot;....	2001-01-13

Weber combines excellent plotting, believable (and well developed) characters, technology and fast paced action, laying the ground work for what has become one of the best series in any genre.  Harrington finds herself &quot;banished&quot; to the far reaches of Basilisk Station, a kind of &quot;Siberia&quot; for those commanding officers of the Manticorian Navy who have displeased the &quot;Powers That Be&quot;...(why she has displeased them forms an intrical part of the book, which I won't give away here...), but Honor is determined that the assignment will NOT BE a banishment, and starts making the station an important one and finds herself in the middle of a plot by the &quot;Peoples Republic of Haven&quot; to annex the area...Despite the high regard I have for the book and the series in general, it is not perfect, and two of its flaws are in strong evidence here..1) Weber does wonderful work defining and writing his characters with the curious exception of Honor Harrington herself. Her determination and abilities just are, no attempt to show how Honor &quot;came to be&quot; is shown...the second flaw is Weber constanly throws all sort of techinal digressions at you...perhaps to show that he has done research and his &quot;theoretical facts&quot; (to coin a phrase) have some scienctific background...whatever the reason, I personally find them a bitoverwhelming and (sadly) a bit on the boring side...they definetly distract from the story.

In &quot;Breakthrough&quot; the war finally begins to wind down as the Confederates find themselves unable to fight on two fronts, nor cope with the &quot;barrel&quot; (tanks) tatics that have allowed the U.S. to break through their lines.  After  a false start, a armistice is declared, but now what? In the victorius US, the people are faced with intergrating new territory into their Union, despite partisan activity in Canada, the Socialists are gaining power in Congress, while in the South, the communist revolt of the blacks have been finally crushed (or has it?), leaving a residue of bitterness, and a veteran, (parelling Hitler's rise in post WWI Germany) curses the stay at homes, the office corp and the blacks who caused the defeat and who also kept him from promotion. Dr. Turtledove seems to laying groundwork here for notjust one more book, but at least one more series...This series has been a great read, (and I include &quot;How Few Remain&quot; which isn't supposed tobe part of the series,but is..)and I eagerly look forward to the last book in it, and the next series as well.....	2000-11-12

It is more, far more, than a report on &quot;today I shot this and yesterday I shot that&quot; type of writing one so often sees in books of this nature. Some of Ruark's articles on the Mau-Mau uprising in Kenya are included, as fine a piece of straight reporting as was ever done on the terror of that period, along with a short story with (of course) an African/ Mau-Mau theme included as well. Some may complain about Ruark's apparent racism, but the best answer to that is to remind those critcs that both the English colonial government of Kenya AND its first &quot;native&quot; (black African) government both wound up banning Ruark from entering the country.  When a reporter gets both sides mad at him its usually a sign that he is doing a fairly rounded job.  Robert Ruark loved Africa as he loved no place (and few people), and the articles in this book show that.  Those who disapprove of the sport of hunting will want to skip this book, since safaris make up the biggest part of it, but anyone interested in a view of Africa during the turbulent times of the '50's and early '60's would not want to miss it, and anyone interested the fine writing of the driven, self destructive genius that was Robert Ruark MUST have this book.....	2000-10-16

Mr. West writes an excellent Western novel. The flaws (and admittedly this is a bit of nit-picking) come in some research errors, to wit: The cap-lock rifle, while defintely superior to the flintlock, was not used to any great extent prior to late 1840's.  The mountain men hung on to their flintlocks long after the caplock was proven, the main reason being simply that there was no way to resupply yourself with caps if they became wet or lost, but a piece of flint (or a workable substitute) was relativly easy to find...The other problem here is that the hero, Jim Tracy, a.k.a. Trace McCall, ALWAYS wins...and always with little or no problem...As a 14 year old in the beginning of the book, he escapes Indians, &quot;professional&quot; hit men (so to speak), tops a horse trading con man and always without significant problems.  Despite this (and I admited I was nit-picking remember)the book is well worth reading...the &quot;downfall&quot; of the rendevous system is acturally pictured, and the future adventures of Trace McCall are eagerly awaited...	2000-10-12

Wilbur Smith is my favorite author, and &quot;A Falcon Flies&quot; is one of his best.  You are introduced to the Ballentyne's, Maj. Zouga Ballentyne and his sister, Dr. Robin Ballentyne as they search Africa for their missing father, the famous missonary and anti-slavery cruscader Fuller Ballentyne and have the bad luck to travel to Africa on board the ship of Mungo St.John, who it turns out, is a infamous slave trader himself...With that breathless start, you would expect action and lots of it, and you won't be disappointed.  Duels, attack by slave traders on the Ballentyne safari, and ship to ship battles with thundering broadsides are but some of what is in store for the reader.  Smith has never been afraid to write a strong woman character, and Robin Ballentyne certainly qualifes, coming close to unsympathic, being saved mainly by her constant concern for human life, never hestiating to place her own in jepoardy to help the ill or injured, but always sure of being right and never hestiating to say so.  Neither is Zouga perfect, being more concerned with making the expedition profitable,from gold and ivory, than finding his father.All of Wilbur Smith's books are of the &quot;keep you up late reading it&quot; variety but &quot;Falcon&quot; is ones of his best, which makes it one of THE best, period.....	2000-10-01

In Danger's Path is the longest and ,to me, the most ponderous of the Corp series.  I have been reading it since its debut, and it has been my favorite of Griffin's various series, but this one misses the mark rather  badly.  The usual fast paced action just isn't here and as one previous  reviewer mentioned the focus has moved from the Corp to covert operations.   The plot of this book centers on the weather station in the Gobi Desert,(an  operation refered to in several other books, but now no longer on hold)and  group of American refugees from Japanese occupied China.  One flaw I  noticed is that throughout the books, any one with knowledge of  &quot;Magic&quot; cannot be sent into any situation where they may be taked  prisoner, but apparently this rule does not apply to Capt. McCoy, since at  one point he is asked if he knows what &quot;Magic&quot; is, and replies he  doesn't know but he can guess, which he does accuratly, and is promptly  sent on a dangerous mission anyway.

This book, by investigative reporter Larry Shook is an eye-opening and sometimes horrifying look at what is happening in the world of pure-bred dogs today...  Using his first purchase of a pure-bred as a tragic example,  he begins a search to find what went wrong and finds that we are killing  our dogs with kindness. The popularity of certain breeds has allowed puppy  mills (worth a tell all book in itself) and unprincipled breeders to pass  on gentic diseases and defects that doom the dog from the start, and now,  because of these practices have been allowed unchecked, these same diseases  and defects are not merely common but to be expected in certain animals.   One shocking bit of information is that the AKC has, to a certain degree,  encouraged these practices by allowing &quot;fashion&quot; to rule in the  show ring and simply by the fact the AKC makes money by simply registering  purebreds, healthy or not...(n fairness Mr. Shook also points out that at  the time of the book's printing (1992) the AKC had begun to take some steps  toward correcting this)Mr.Shook details exactly what the potential buyer of  a pure-bred should be looking for, what questions to ask and where to go  for ACCURATE information on the breed you are interested in...Sadly, this  book is out of print now, as it should be required reading for anyone  considering the purchase of pure-bred dog.....	2000-05-21

A small town in West Virginia somehow find themselves displaced, not merely through time, but through location as well and find themselves in the Germany of 1632, right in the middle of the Thirty Years War.  The book  is well paced and the author, Eric Flint, has done a thorough job of  research on the historical aspects of this book.  ( A slight case of hero  worship for the Swedish king Gustav Adolphus is evident, but not to the  point of hurting the book).  Where the problem comes,in my opinion, is the  way this small community rapidly becomes the domiant power in the area.   Granted modern weapons would give a small &quot;army&quot; a tremendous  advantage over a 17th century army, but one thing not considered is that  modern weapons require, unlike the matchlocks and wheelocks of that period,  modern powder, modern bullets,primers and occasional replacement of the  cartridge cases. Even a small &quot;country&quot; town with well stocked  gunshops could not keep even a tiny army actively campaining supplied long,  but yet this does not seem to be a problem here.  What is even more  unbelivable, the whole process (including rescaling their 20th ,or 21st ,if  you prefer, lifstyle) takes only a year or so...no struggle for survial  here....a fast paced and basically well written book but one that stretches  the bounds of crediability even for this genre...	2000-05-16

This is a wonderful and badly needed book.  Most (though not all) of the more popular breeds are represented here, catagorized not by the AKC group, but by where they would fit in with human life-styles.  You will see what  breeds need lots and lots of daily excerise, which breeds have high  grooming needs, shedding problems (or not) temperment, and something most  other books skip over, which genetic diseases are common in which breed.  Input for this book comes not only from the authors, but also from  professional dog trainers and vets so the opinions (or judgements if you  prefer) are not just those of the authors.

First person fiction is not Wilbur Smiths' strong suit,but in a Smith novel, you hardly notice that with the usual break-neck pace of the action. A reader hoping for insights into ancient Egypt will be disappointed, for Smith is not a historical writer and does pretend to be. What he does  deliver, (as always), is rapid paced action packed story. No book by this  author is disappointing, a bad Smith is better than 99% of the other  novelists working today.  The major disappointment here is the main  character, Taita, who comes across as a arrogant know-it-all, by far the  least sympathic main character Smith has ever written.

The myths of buried treasure are dealt with and  by listing some actual &quot;pirate plunder&quot; (in one case consisting  of a load of cod and some rope)demonstates that, in most cases, there was  little to BE buried. Yes there were large treaures taken but for the most  part very very rare,and the list of pirates executed at the end of the book  shows graphically what their usual fate was....Altogether one of the best,  if not the best, introduction to those times available.	2000-04-27

Contary to what was said in another review, the quotes  are all documented, and the reader is shown where the information is if  they choose to verify themselves. All Ms. Marquardt is asking for is a  level playing field rather than the slanted, biased reporting that so often  takes place in our society today.....	2000-04-25

This ones begins with Alexander and ends with the fall of Rome, with some much appreciated side trips to India and China, two areas so often neglected by  our Western educational system.  Side trips are probably not the best way  todescribe the &quot;visits&quot; to India and China, as they (especially  China) take up a large portion of the book.  The birth of several of the  worlds major religons are here as is Confusius (not a especially flattering  portrait b.t.w.) Once again the reader is provided with an excellent  bibilography at the end for further research.  Mr. Gonick, many, many  readers such as myself eagerly await volume 3......	2000-04-25

This book written by the late Professor Havilah Babcock can only be described as a classic of its day.(Although honestly, any of his titles qualify for the same description.)  Some may be offended by what seems to  be a mild racism,ISthere such athing as &quot;mild racism&quot;) but it is  nessary to keep in mind the times in which Babcock lived and wrote...The  series of stories/aricles/essays that make up this book capture a almost  gone subculture of the South and do so in a way only someone who both lived  in it and loved it dearly could do. The writing almost totally deal with  one of two subjects: quail hunting and fishing in lowcountry South  Carolina, with a side trip or two to the love of dogs, and just plain old  gentle happy memories of a man who loved the life he had and wanted people  to know he loved it...In the years to come I have no doubts that this book  will be remember as the classic it is, and it will become more widely read,  and if all that truly comes to pass, it couldn't happen to a better book	2000-04-24

None of these men were born great, but wound up achieving  (in the case of Travis) or having it thrust upon them..(Crockett and  Bowie)All of these men were flawed, Travis and Crockett with irreponsibilty  and Bowie a general disregard for the law. (The book doesn't say this, but  you get the impression that Bowie's death wasn't terribly far ahead of an  arrest warrent..)Crockett had failed in two terms as a congressman, but not  really through any fault of his own in this case. He had angred Andrew  Jackson,and in the election of 1835, told the voters he had done his best  and if they didn't like it,&quot;You can go the hell and I'll go to  Texas&quot; (not &quot;I'll go to hell or Texas&quot; as another reviewer  puts it. Bowie was a land swindler, Travis's marriage had failed...Yet  these three flawed men rose above all faults and failings to become  American heroes.  We need our heroes and this book helps us understand how  ordinary men, feet of clay and all, can and often do become heroes....	2000-04-22

The Traditional Bowyers Bible is the best book on the subject I have read so far on this interesting subject. All 3 volumes are worth having, but this one, the first volume, offers the beginning bowyer a complete course  in building a wooden bow. I disagree with an earlier reviewer of this book  on its value to the beginner. I am a novice bowyer (bow-builder) if not a  novice archer, and I thought the book was especially valuable.  In fact  that seems tobe exactly the person Hamm and the other contributors to this  book seem to have had in mind....All three books come under the heading of  &quot;don't miss&quot;, but this one in particular is a &quot;DON'T  miss&quot;...	2000-04-21

Beautiful color photos are on almost every page of this book, covering the &quot;golden age&quot; of slot cars (roughly coinciding with the '60's)Those of us old enough to remember those glory days (never mind how  old!)will drool over the shots of the Cox, KB, and Monogram cars (and  probably bore to tears those around us with long speeches about how things  were in the &quot;good old days&quot;)The &quot;backbone&quot; of the home  slot racer, Strombecker,is well represented here as its earlier British  counterpart,Scalextric. The fact that remainders of the Cox inventory wound  up in land-fills will bring tears to the eyes of many of us...The book is  worth the price for the photos alone, with the excellent text being icing  on the cake.  Not as comprensive as I would have liked but you can have  everything... one minor criticism being some models are given significant  coverage in the text, with no photos of them presented. But man, this old  slot car racer has loved every mintue spent browsing, and remembering, with  this book....	2000-04-21

This book is actually three previous books by this author combined into a single volume... Mr. Newark has studied his subject well and presents the history of each era in a coherent and interesting fashion... Most of the  names in the book, with a few exceptions, wil not be familiar to the  average reader, for this is not about the kings and emperors of those days,  but about those who truly ruled in those turbulent times.  The book is  profusely illustrated by drawings dating from roughly Victorian England  back to the periods under discussion, along with photos of archological  finds, plus color section done by an excellent historical artist, Angus  McBride.  For the person interested in these periods of history, this book  is well worth the money....	2000-04-16

Imagine a group of 20th century people suddenly transported to the bronze age, c.1250 B.C.  That is the premise behind this book.  The &quot;moderns&quot; are the inhabitants of the island of Nantucket, some  7000 of them and they are now forced to deal with the diffcultly of  adapting to totally alien life style, not to mention  avoiding  starvation... Some of the other reviewers of this book have mentioned  Stirling's liberal viewpoint, and I admit having as a main character a gay  black woman was a bit of a jolt, and the concept of the island just  &quot;happening to have&quot; people with nessary skills seems a bit  far-fetched, but these are no more than ripples in a sea of smooth flowing  narrative. I would have personally prefered to have seen more about the  &quot;Nantucketers&quot; struggle to adapt to their new world rather than  jumping into the actions of renagde William Walker, but I am aware that  that would have slowed the book more...Now that all three books in the  series are available I can say this is one of the masterpieces of the  alternative history genre, from first to last....	2000-04-13

This is a fairly small book (just over 200 pages) which presents a &quot;Readers Digest&quot; verison of England at time of the 1st millennium. It is not intend to be particulary detailed, but a light, easy  to read overview of how England's ( and by extension, our own) culture was  shaped by the events and people of that time, and it does this  admirably...By using illustrations which are copies of those in the  &quot;Julius Work Calendar&quot;. the authors take you through a  &quot;typical&quot; year for the people of that time..No, it is not  in-depth but it does furnish a wonderful starting point for those of you  who, like me, are interested in the history of this interesting but often  neglected period of history....	2000-04-12

The entire series has been excellent, though it  seems as if Mr. Stirling intends at least one more book rather than the  three orginally planned. The &quot;Republic of Nantucket&quot; (the island  of Nantucket mysteriously thrown back to 1200 B.C.)still has to deal with  renagade Coast Guard officer William Walker and his followers, now  scattered over a large part of southern Europe, nothern Africa and what we  call today the Middle East...Stirling leaves  a few loose ends remaining to  be tied up (a reason I think at least one more book is coming)and the  confrontation with Walker is anti-climatic, (Walker himself is almost a  secondary character in this book)One criticism though, one of the battle  scenes in &quot;Oceans&quot; is lifted almost word for word from the movie  &quot;Zulu&quot; with no acknowlegement of the fact and I would have  preferred that a writer of Mr. Stirlings stature would have at least given  a nod of the head to it...an excellent book all around despite that... BUT  (imagine the &quot;Jaws theme playing  in the background) Isketrol  still  rules in Tartessos,McAndrews is still loose in Africa, and Walker's  daugther Althea is riding north with her fathers followers swearing revenge  and that she will not make the same mistakes and she will not &quot;strike  too soon&quot;....	2000-04-12

To add my two cents worth to a comment from an earlier reviewer of this book...Wilbur Smith is the best novelist writing today..period!!&quot;Monsoon&quot;is a worthy sucessor to &quot;Birds of  Prey&quot; and another welcome (but too long in coming...) addition to the  &quot;Smith list&quot; &quot;Monsoon&quot; continues the story of the early  Courntey seafarers, Sir Henry and his sons, Tom Guy and Dorian.  As is  common in Smith's book there is a bit of tension (shall we say) between  some of the brothers. Sir Henry, after 4 years away from the sea, must  undertake, at the crowns request, an extremely dangerous undertaking, and  takes his sons along on the voyage with consequences for all, including  death, loss of fortune and capture and more adventures than any 4 men  should have to undertake. This book takes the Courtney's to Africa for the  first time, and Smith's love and awe for this land shows in every line.When  he describes the beauty and granduer and yes..violence of the &quot;Dark  Continent&quot; you can see and feel it as you find yourself walking along  with his characters..(telling which characters and the circumstances would  be giving away too much of the plot..)If you have never read a Wilbur Smith  book, deny yourself no longer..hurry down to your bookstore or amazon..or  even your library and get this book..then read the other 26 books..and  discover why Wilbur Smith fans are so loyal..but Mr. Smith, if you should  read these lines..PLEASE dont make your readers wait two years for the next  one....	1999-05-10

Stirling's sequel to &quot;Island in the Sea of Time&quot;... and unlike so many sequels, this book is every bit as compelling as the first one. I may as get the bad part  out the way first...I wasn't all that choked up by the cover...&lt;g&gt;  other than that though..the book is first class in every way.  The time is  8 years after the &quot;Event&quot; that propelled the island of Nantucket  into the Bronze Age, and the islanders have adjusted as well as possible.  Some of the characters from the first book who were major figures then are  more or less minor in this one... Chief Jared Cofflin..now the  &quot;chief&quot; of the Republic of Nantucket is only visible now and  again..but other charcters are developing to replace this. The plotting is  excellent..the battle scenes realistic...and the renagade Coast Guard  officer, William Walker, is still a very capable and ruthless villian.(It  is very refreshing to  see a villian who is as intelligent as those who  oppose them..)Some historical people from the Trojan War are around, as are  some ancient (to us in the 20th century that is) empires that figure  largely in the story. Once caution though... if you have NOT read  &quot;Island...&quot; i strongly reccomend you do, as it will add much to  your enjoyment of this book. But I also strongly suggest you don't miss  either book.	1999-04-13
