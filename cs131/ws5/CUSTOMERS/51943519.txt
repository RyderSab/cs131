US	51943519	R20FQKSM3F6DPA	0553584502	303170656	The Taking	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A new face of Dean Koontz	I noticed a lot of unhappy reviews for this book that seem to compare it to Koontz's older novels. It appears they have gotten used to a certain style and genre, and were not prepared to accept a new approach. This novel is different in a few aspects. One difference is that it's got a single viewpoint(Unlike \\"The Face\\", \\"One Door Away From Heaven\\", and others that offer too many viewpoints) Personally, I found that refreshing because it helped me stay focused. Also, there is less drama, more action, and more terror. Koontz explores unchartered territory in this novel that may first strike as clich, but promises more than a few shocking surprises. <br /> <br />Whether or not the idea of the novel appeals to you, the plot is still exciting, intriguing, and fast-paced to qualify it as a top quality work of fiction. Even in the bizzarre realm of this plot, the Dean Koontz flair is evident. The sense of being there, knowing the characters, sharing their environment and experiences is overwhelming. Enhanced by colorful prose, reading this novel was like indulging in a multi-flavored, multi-textured dessert. It pulls you out of the real world and takes you on a journey where you are to find yourself in a storm of wonder, amusement, and most of all, unimaginable terror. Advice: not for bedtime reading. <br /> <br />There are a few dogs in the book (again), but they are not as central as in some of Koontz's other books. Their roles are important, but subtly presented. As with many--if not all--his novels, Mr. Koontz doesn't merely tell a story, but offers readers a message to ponder about. Although \\"The Taking\\" is not long, single-viewpointed, and appears as a straightforward plot, you will have no idea where it's going until, quite literally, the awe-inspiring last page.	2005-08-15
US	51943519	R1K7UGNPRJ07IS	0553802488	607743484	The Face	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Superb plot, though heavy on exposition	Dean Koontz has a knack for creating scenes down to the smallest detail, and character profiles that draw you into the deepest chambers of the character's minds. This is all wonderful, but it comes at a cost of bringing the action to a complete halt. In most of his books, Koontz manages to juggle both exposition and action while keeping the suspense rolling at breathtaking speed. In \\"The Face\\" however, the action was very often interrupted or slowed down by long paragraphs of description in the first three-quarters of the book.    Regardless, Koontz's prose and vivid imagery is delicious when read thoughtfully. As for plot, it was gripping from the start. While the story unfolds, you find yourself completely absorbed by the wonder of a series of bizzarre events. By the last third, you may cancel all appointments and chores for sake of soaking up the story to the very last word. Yes, it is that exciting. Why? In this particular novel, Koontz weaves together a tapestry of crime, suspense, drama, pshychology, humor, then seasons it well with extreme evil and extreme goodness.     Additionally, if you read any of his other books, you would know he has a tendency to lead you to believe in the supernatural only to delight (or disappoint) you with a scientific (or sci-fi) resolution. \\"The Face\\" applies the same technique, though more intensely, tying the loose ends most unexpectedly. This is the type of story that would likely remain memorable for a long time.	2005-08-04

From cover to cover, the entire subject of this book is the six elements of the German training scale: Rhythm and relaxation, suppleness, contact, impulsion, straightness, and collection. In clear and concise language, this book illustrates that you cannot progress to one level before establishing the one before. It proves that before you ask for impulsion, you must have contact, and if you encounter tension in collection, you go back to relaxation. In other words, the authors successfully bring dressage within grips of every rider by providing solid building blocks to progressive dressage training.<br />Each element of the training scale is explained thoroughly. Potential problems are addressed with practical, easy solutions. By absorbing this information, you'll find that dressage is surprisingly simple...hence the title. Beware, though, that there is no intense detail as there is in other dressage books. For example, you won't find a 5-page description of the half-halt. You won't find a step-by-step instruction of the half-pass. You will, however, realze the importance of working by a system and you will see it reflecting on your horse.<br />A beautifully bound book and a joy to flip through with its numerous color photos. Definitely worth reading regardless of your level.	2004-06-06

It is by no means a quick, light read. It's a textbook to be read, studied, and absorbed with dedication. Charles de Kunffy is a master of classical dressage who apparently spent a great deal of effort putting this book together for the serious rider. He has high ideals and evident compassion for the horse, and structures all his techniques and strategies with the welfare of the horse in mind. <br />The 300 pages in this book cover a huge range of topics. Always the philosopher, Mr. de Kunffy writes in thick yet imaginative language, provoking just the right mental pictures. Everything is covered from the rider's seat to competition preparation. You will gain a greater, fuller understanding of correct seat and aids, correct flexion of the horse, lateral work, improving the basic gaits, and further schooling to higher level dressage. He also discusses various equipment and their uses.<br />This is an extremely valuable guide to any serious rider. Beware, though, that it's not for a beginner.	2003-06-09

I bought this book to prove to myself that communicating with animals is not real. But before I reached halfway, I was already a believer. It's real, and it's strange. Nicci Mackay actually speaks her thoughts to animals, asking them questions about their behavior, feelings, etc, and receives answers from them. She's not a horse whisperer like Monty Roberts. This woman can carry on a conversation with any horse (although she can't always persuade them to do things for her!)<br />Nicci's writing is beautiful and captivating. Her book is nicely put together chronologically (unlike some autobiographies which keep jumping back and forth). Her stories can be dreadfully depressing or hilariously funny. Some of her experiences are downright eccentric, though not lacking charm. She has a brilliant sense of humor that caught me off guard in situations where I should have contained my laughter. <br />To sum things up, this book is a gem and I will read it many more times. I wholeheartedly urge you to pick a copy for yourself--regardless of whether you are a believer or not. Niccy Mackay, if you read this, please drop me a line as I would like you to talk to my horse. <br />Reader, what are you still doing reading this review? Buy the book!	2002-04-11

I had read Mark Rashid's two other books, and his name on this one was all I needed to make the purchase. I have already been educated and inspired from 'Considering the Horse' and 'Horses Never Lie' more than I have been from all other horse books put together. I knew 'A Good Horse Is Never a Bad Color' would be as good. I was not disappointed.<br />Unlike the other two, though, this book covers a slightly different subject. While the others mainly discuss training attitude and problem solving, this one focuses on making good horses. It discusses practical issues such as choosing a good horse, imprinting newborns, early training, solving problems that might occur along the way, and even changing a bad horse into a good horse. Of course, Mark never tells you, \\"if you have a problem with that, do this to solve it.\\" Instead, he writes in story format, recalling his experiences as they happened. This charming style guarantees the book unputdownable. Even if you are not into horses, you could read this book as an autobiography.<br />In the last chapter, Mark concludes that it was 'the old man' who had passed on this gift to him. He hopes that through this book, he had been able to pass on the gift to the reader. But really, to learn the gift and use it, you must read all his books. They complete each other and deliver his message to the world: a horse will give his all to the person who talks to him in a language he understands. This book costs only $[money], but I would've bought it even it the price was $500. If you have to read only one book in your life about horses, make it one of Mark Rashid's.	2002-03-31

Teresa's style is captivating and exciting, helping the reader live her experiences. The stories are long-term events rather than specific anecdotes, and they don't all have 'endings'. Her passion for the horse is evident and refreshing because I felt that, hey, I'm not alone after all. However, what I found a little depressing was the emphasis on life and death issues. A brief mentioning would have been okay, but she kept referring back to it throughout the book, making the issue seem more like a ground stone on which the rest of the book is constructed. I should also say that the title of the book is a little misleading. The stories are not about horses the papers would've written about. They are about horses who have influenced lives and taught lessons (and only those who have crossed the author's path). Personally, I loved it and would highly recommend it. I just would've liked a little less emphasis on life and death philosophies.	2002-03-20

Most of the recipes are exotic and use unheard-of ingredients. Despite that, the book jacket specifically claims that the recipes are easy to prepare (which may be true) and the ingredients are easily found in your kitchen cabinet. Not true. I doubt you would find 'trompettes de la mort' and 'hazelnut nougat' handy in your kitchen on any given night. You would need to plan and shop ahead before you attempt a recipe from this book.<br />Beware that the 'one pot' principle is adhered to only if you're willing to wash out the same pot several times to finish off the recipe. The photography is lovely, of course. And some recipes are 'normal' enough for the home cook. Just don't expect to find many chicken and potato recipes. You will find more squid, monkfish (which the author clearly states is an endangered species), foie gras, scallops, and kangaroo(!). I suppose you would find this book useful if you're into innovative cooking and have a lot of time to spare shopping at speciality shops.	2002-03-17

Not so. Chris Irwin presents his subject (which is much broader than you may think) with concrete advice and solid information that he has gathered through his many years of experience with horses. He writes with an honest, down-to-earth style that is guaranteed to both touch your heart and appeal to your mind.<br />The first half of the book is a study of horse psychology in comparison to human psychology. Chris explains the different ways that horses and people view the world using the terms 'prey consciousness' and 'predator consciousness'. Although many horse people are aware that horses view their world from the eyes of a prey, they don't quite comprehend that we approach horsemanship from the eyes of a predator. This is the first book I have read that thoroughly explores this issue and offers solutions and ideas to help us bond with our horses.<br />Chris also runs through identifying equine body language to enable us to effectively understand and communicate with horses. Following that, he uses metaphors and imagery weaved with realistic tips and guidelines to explain the basis of achieving smooth forward movement in the horse, both from the ground and under saddle.<br />The second half of the book I found not particularly useful as I couldn't apply his message to myself. The author devotes an entire chapter to encourage people to get in touch with their inner self, develop a positive attitude, heal their souls, and generally change their outlook on life into a brighter and more productive view. Once he was through with that, he finally discussed the subject of how horses can help us heal from within. The last one-quarter of the book is the most inspirational.<br />Horses Don't Lie is a great read for every horse person willing to take their relationship with their horse one step further. The title of the book is slightly misleading; much more than what it suggests is covered.	2001-11-13

This is a first class page-turner with non-stop action...unpredictable, psychological, and traumatic on your nerves. Although this is one of Dean Koontz's first books, it doesn't lack the suspense which he weaves into every page of his writing. From the very first page, his characters, Joanna Rand and Alex Hunter, took an almost tangible form in an exotic setting that was very realistically painted. <br />The plot was enhanced by being set in Japan. Joanna Rand, a successful business owner, is plagued by crippling phobias that prevent her from leading a normal life. Alex Hunter crosses paths with her during his visit to Japan and finds her situation intruiging. Since he is a detective, he recalls her as a missing person he had been looking for many years earlier. While trying to uncover her story, he discovers that there's a deeper and more frightening dimension to her history. <br />The story is so gripping that I was reading like a machine. At one point I almost got hypnotized myself while reading a scene where the character is hypnotized. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the book took a political twist at the end. I must admit, though, that I was gritting my teeth down to the very last word. Very intense and well worth reading.	2001-09-18

I have read six novels by Dean Koontz before this one and was under the impression that he is more of a science fiction writer than anything else. However, 'Phantoms' proved his skill at creating a story that challenges the sturdiest nerves. I confess that this novel scared the living daylights out of me and left me sleepless for more than a few nights!<br />The story begins with two sisters, Dr Jenny and Lisa, who visit a small town and discover that every person and animal is either dead or missing. From then on, there would be more killings, death, suffering, screaming, mysterious disappearances, and strange forces. As usual, Dean paints realistic characters that are deeply appealing... which I suppose is his way of increasing the tension and having the reader wish the characters would survive. <br />I was surprised by the scientific data that was included in the book. The author's hard work and research is evident in his writing. This makes the novel not only a form of entertainment but a source of knowledge as well. He has amazing creativity and attention to detail. I have seen the movie based on this book but I do not recommend that you watch it - the book is much better.	2001-05-31

I must admit that Mark Rashid is a gift to horses and I sure hope there would be more people like him. I cannot begin to express how inspirational this book had been. Not only is he a great horseman, but he is also a master at writing.<br />'Considering the Horse' is less of a problem solver and more of an attitude adjuster. Don't get me wrong, Mark addresses common problems in this book and provides innovative and effective methods of solving them. It is his suggestions that will be changing many traditional point of views. He does not force his ideas on you, but supports them with logical explanations backed by evidence from real life. Which brings me to the next point: the book's individuality stems from the fact that it is presented in true story format rather than text-book style. I think this format aids in delivering Mark's message in a subtle voice, allowing the reader to absorb the information and start thinking!<br />Mark addresses problems such catching uncatchable horses, picking up feet, stopping unstopable horses, ground manners, loading, headshyness, mounting problems, and balking. He begins by explaining how he decided on his approach and clearly illustrates different situations where different approaches should be taken. From easy quick-fixes to deep-rooted problems.. everything is explained in his entertaining and enlightening stories. He closes the book with a deeply touching story and a lesson for mankind that brought me to tears.<br />I have read his latest book 'Horses Never Lie' before this one and I find both books equally educational. Mark's passion for horses is evident in every word he writes and as I mentioned before, he is also a gifted writer. I believe that he is reaching out to the horse community, offering his knowledge to benefit as many horses in the world as possible. Five stars don't do him or his books justice.	2001-05-22

Horses Never Lie leads the way on horse training, despite the fact that it contains no 'techniques'. Mark Rashid argues against 'training techniques' and shatters the traditional ideal of becoming your horses dominant leader in order to gain his respect. Here, Mark clearly states the difference from becoming your horse's dominant/forced leader to becoming his chosen leader.<br />The stories Mark tells in his book brought tears to my eyes only because they were so inspiring. There really isn't any technique behind the way he trains horses. What his training is all about is 'attitude'. He believes that one would have to earn his horse's trust before any training can progress, then goes on to explain how trust can be earned from your horse. To support his view, he tells tales of problems that were solved based on trust and understanding. Mark states the importance of building a partnership based on trust rather than dominance so as to bring out the best of our horses.<br />His arguments are very logical too. Simply put, horses dislike a forced dominant figure as their responses will be out of fear. This is why we should let our horses choose us as their leaders instead of force our dominance over them. All the ways that this could be achieved are explained in this book. <br />There is nothing wrong with letting your horse have his way sometimes, it goes as far as proving that you are well worth the trust. I will definitely be reading Mark Rashid's other books. The world needs more people like him.	2001-04-29

There are, of course, a few astounding tales told in this book. To state an example: the boy who had never spoken before until he saw a pony and said 'Oh! pony!' <br />Some stories have been contributed by popular equestrian personalities and some others have been written about famous equines. You will find stories of courage, kindness, survival, friendship, and success. I am sure it was a great effort from Kimberly Gatto to put together a book like this.

He does not linger on prose and his usual colorful descriptions - which slows the pace down. Instead, this is a novel that is very fast paced, short, and to-the-point. His innovative plot navigates around a rather simple idea: two innocents persued by a psycho across the continent of the US. The heroes are simple and in this simplicity they were interesting. I was also under the impression that Dean wanted us to sympathize with the villain, which I believe was successfully achieved. He is not Dean's usual blood-thirsty maniac, but is, in fact, seriously disturbed both mentally and emotionally. The novel is not very sharp on the suspense but its fast pace and continous flow of action is what makes it compelling. It ends abruptly, though, with some loose ends; unlike Dean's other books which always have a neat ending. <br />Overall, well worth the 5 stars. It's a light read.. something you could take on a weekend. Will get you thinking too...	2001-04-18

This book defines 'fast paced'. In every page, you will find the sharp thrill of fright, of joy, of suspense, of anticipation. The book is based on an original idea which alone makes this book a gem. <br />The villain is shockingly insane with murder. Torturing living things is his way of living, a pleasurable indulgence. I was gasping and wide-eyed as I was reading his thoughts and attitude and seeing things from his point of view. He's smart and casual and could pass for a very ordinary lad among society, but he leads a secret life and performs his murders just as casually. Dean Koontz gives you entrance into the mind of a psychotic killer in this book... Mr. Vess as he likes calls him. <br />If that is not enough, the persuit will get you right on the edge. The killer gets his hands on two lives and traps them in his lair. Chyna Shepherd is the heroine who tries to escape and free herself not only from the killer, but also from a dark past. With every step she takes towards freedom, she faces another tougher obstacle. There wasn't the usual 'Get to the point, koontz!' in this book - the focus is on the action. <br />This book is everything it claims to be... INTENSE. No review can do it justice, you just have to read it.	2001-03-13

I was impressed by Phil Rickman's writing style and the way he created a sharp sense of time and place for this novel. The plot was good but I think the suspense was weak. I think this novel is more of a mystery rather than a thriller, a real story rather than a fantasy. The characters were interesting enough, but there was an abundance of characters which I found to be a bit confusing. I do not believe the characters were stereotypical; they were realistic with very unique and captivating personalities. Quite frankly, it is the characters who made the story interesting, not the plot. The cover states that it's about exorcism, but no such thing occurs in the story, atleast not of any importance. It is simply about the corruption of the church of England and about strange ideas affecting the younger generation beliefs. It carries a few surprises but will require patience to read.	2001-02-23

Sometimes I was extremely impressed, sometimes deeply disappointed. To get the worst out of the way, let me state the disappointing factors first: Dean Koontz needs to read 'The 38 Most Common Fiction Writing Mistakes' and take a good look at the chapter labeled 'Don't Lecture Your Reader'! I cannot totally attack Koontz though, because sometimes the information he lingers on is important for the story, but for God's sake be brief because it disrupts the flow of events!<br />Now this book is about a gifted young man who can see the evil presence lurking beneath a human disguise. This evil is a physical being - not something of spiritual nature - 'goblins' as he calls them. He stalks them, kills them, and he can also see the misery that they had brought over the earth. Like in all of Dean's books, the story is enhanced by several very real, very compelling characters. And as usual, you'll love and admire the characters. You'll be surprised too, because things will be turned upside down quite a few times, which is what makes this book exciting. <br />I wouldn't say that it is particularly very scary. It is gripping, yes. Thrilling, yes. Even bizzarre. But not enough to classify it as horror. It can be slow at times, which is why it occured to me to give it 4 stars instead of 5, but the way it ended made it worthy of more than 5 stars. It takes a very emotional turn and suddenly you may find yourself so tuned in that time and place seize to exist. I was touched so deeply by this story, deeper than many of the other books I have read for him. <br />Dean is also a great thinker. In a way, he carries a message in this book that is close to saying that he wished he could blame all the misery in the world on the 'goblins'. That we, humans, cannot be entirely blamed on the destruction of our world... wishful thinking of course, but an idea on which he built this book.	2001-02-21

It only goes as far as Novice or Elementary level dressage and covers some jumping techniques. It's a book about the basics to help build some foundations, but if you already know your foundations, then find another book. There are also lots of helpful illustrations and b/w photographs to back up the explanations. If you are a novice or you have specific riding problems, you will find this book quite handy.

The 'basics' does not make this book for amateurs, because even some advanced riders have not had the basics cleared. I was inspired by Herbermann's respect for the horse and his approach on making training more pleasurable for horses. His simple and clear instuction on the essence of classical riding makes it within reach of every rider. The first part of the book focuses on the rider's position and aids. Later on, collection and advanced work is described in detail. He doesn't get into very advanced stages though...flying changes, canter pirouettes, piaffe, passage, etc., are not covered. The book is about getting the basics right. <br />The title of the book very much explains what it is about - the formula that will help you reach new heights with your horse. I recommend this book to every rider willing to give their horse more comfort and joy in dressage.	2001-02-11

A shockingly strange novel yet it was made real by the artistic and imaginative writing of Dean Koontz. As in many of his books, the story starts slow in the first two chapters, but it gains speed as it progresses, and eventually becomes difficult to catch up with the action because you'll find yourself having to skip a few lines as a result of a build up of anticipation.<br />His characters, as usual, will capture your heart. Dean attributes uncommon traits to them, taking them almost to the extreme. The hero has XP, which limits him to living in darkness, and his best buddy, Bobby, is the coolest, most laid back, placid, and yet interesting character I have ever encountered in any novel. I didn't want the story to end because it was like parting with some very dear friends!<br />Dean likes to mess with your nerves. He sets you up to believe something weird or scary is about to happen, then half of the time breaks the suspense with sarcasm. His weapon in this novel is his hero's imagination, which he uses to manipulate your nerves. The dialogue is captivating - achingly funny in occasions where you need a laugh - and indeed so real.<br />This book deserves more than 5 stars. You don't have to be a science fiction fan to enjoy it for I certainly am not. Dean has the ability to scare the living daylight out of you and still keep you laughing. Honestly, I could keep on writing about all the wonders of this book, so do yourself a favor and read it. I sure hope there will be a sequel. Speaking of sequels, this novel is itself a sequel to 'Fear Nothing'. It may be worthwhile to read that one first.	2001-02-06

There are four main characters in this book, the hero being a victim of Xeroderma pigmentosum, a skin disease that limits his life to total darkness. This causes the action to take place mostly during the night - over the course of two nights exactly. I can't say that this is a fast paced story because the actions stops very often when the author pauses to engage in recalls from the past. <br />He had a good plot for this book, but it is actually based on a previous novel titled 'Watchers'. This is not exactly a sequel, but you will find some reference in it to Watchers. There is a dog here too, quite similiar to the dog in Watchers. Koontz has a vivid imagination which proves quite interesting when celebrating the end of the world - figuratively speaking. <br />Another point I would like to make is that you cannot read this book without reading 'Seize the Night' because the story continues. 'Fear Nothing' is simply an introductory novel to the real action packed book 'Seize the Night'. This one is quite wordy too, which can be annoying when you're in the middle of a spine-chilling moment.	2001-01-28

That's not to say there aren't any recipes in the book, because there are, but they're not 'spectacular'. This is the type of book you buy when you want to eat genuinely healthy food while knowing exactly what vitamins, minerals, fibers, etc you are getting into your body. It's divided into chapters, beginning with a detailed explanation of a number of 'bonus foods', telling us what they are good for, how they improve our health, their vitamin and mineral content, and a few recipes in which they could be used. The next chapter focuses on a lot more foods, explaining in less detail their benefit to our health. There is also a section in which you could identify any health problems you might have, then follow their suggestions through a customized diet plan. Brilliant color photography makes this book as enjoyable to look at as it is to read.	2001-01-28

I must say, however, that this is a family cook book. The simplicity of the desserts make them suitable for the kids, a family gathering, etc, rather than a formal event where you would like to prepare something extravagant. The recipes do call for alcohol and not many of them turn out as you would expect even if you follow the recipe to the letter. Some baking timings and temperature are inaccurate as well, so you have to use your own experience and judgement in that matter. A nicely done book over all with an introduction for every recipe. Few photos, though, if you are the type who likes to see the finished product before attempting your hand at it.	2001-01-28

The first book I read for Dean Koontz was Watchers - it was enough to get me hooked on his books. False Memory is an intense plot painted with achingly real characters. Dean enhances the plot with a deeply descriptive writing style which may at times seem puzzling but nonetheless adding flavour to the action. <br />Although this is quite a large book, it reads like a breeze because the actions takes place in a very short period of time. The story reveals itself slowly, increasing the suspense with every page. The mere fact that this is a psychological thriller makes this book one of a kind. <br />What I favored in this book was that not many characters are wasted. There is no excessive frustration at loosing characters that we have become emotionally attached to. Even the most bizzarre behavior exhibited by the characters is convincing - and you will see a lot of that! <br />Dean Koontz has obviously put a lot of research into this book in order to write about complicated aspect of the human mind: total control of the subconscious. I was left in awe at the end of every chapter and I hereby declare it well worth reading.	2001-01-02
US	51943519	R28RPDOTEDWXEF	0425107469	50861192	Watchers	Books	5	37	38	N	N	A dazzling combination of suspense, horror, and romance	You have not read a book until you have read Watchers by Dean Koontz. Why? I will try to be brief.. no book can ever match the powerful beginning of this novel. It was gripping, thrilling, from page 3. There is a lot of description, but Dean has a way of making every description useful and enjoyoyable - unlike some authors who bore you to death with totally irrelevant paragraphs. His characters may be extreme in some ways, nevertheless, they were painted into realistic people that can indeed exist in real life. For the first few chapters.. you will be intrigued at how different incidents can be connected.. then slowly and with a lot of mystery, the story begins to connect and become clearer.<br />Travis, Nora, Einstein, and Vince are the main characters in the book. Dean allows you to see the world from their eyes, which can be fascinating because they are fascinating characters! <br />Einstein, the dog, will capture your heart. Even the evil presence in the story will have you sympathize with it. The plot is structured so well that there is no spot where the action slows down. Given the long time within which the story takes place, this novel is very fast paced and will leave you at the edge of your seat.<br />And I have to confess that Koontz does not leave you unsatisfied or frustrated at any point. The characters will ask the questions that you have in your mind, and the action will keep you fully aware of the current situation. The suspense will leave you shuddering, and the romance will warm your heart. This is a story that is full of emotion.. where there is a lesson at the end for mankind. It will stay in my heart to the end of my life.	2000-12-12

Generally speaking, the advice offered is occasionally useful, but it is more aimed at the totally inexperienced writer who has no clue on how to write a novel. If you follow his advice, you'll probably end up with a novel he would like.. but there are hundreds of very successful novels out there that don't match the requirements he listed in this book. It's a quick read if the book grabs your interest, but personally, I think there are many better books out there on writing fiction.	2000-11-09

There are definitely more sauces in this book than you can possibly try. They are divided and arranged by type and purpose, which makes it easy to pick out the sauce that you need. Some of the ingredients are somewhat hard to find, but most recipes can be prepared with minimal fuss. My favorite part of this book is the marinades chapter.. you can combine a marinade with a similar sauce and end up with something spectacular. Another useful chapter is the fruit sauces chapter, which proved to be very valuable on that special occasion when you wanted to enhance the flavor of your desserts.

I have only tried 3 so far, but each one has been a great success. The book begins by explaining the origins of chocolate, history of chocolate, how it's made, etc., then moves on to explaining how to work with chocolate. There is also a fair amount of detailing and photography on making impressive chocolate decoration for your desserts, which is actually easy to prepare. The book offers recipies for pies, mousses, cakes, cookies, confectionary, ice creams, drinks, and sauces. I must warn you, though, that some recipes call for as much as 300 grams of butter, and some call for 3 cups of double cream. I tried them once and the results were delicious, but not worth the health hazard. <br />Nevertheless, the final results taste great and look great. One you should try if you buy the book: the Striped Cheesecake!	2000-11-06

This book touched me at a very deep emotional level. It is THE best book  written on the subject, covering all aspects of relationships between  humans and animals, from acts of heroism to telepathy to life-long  partnerships. This is not just a collection of stories, but an in-depth  discussion of how our world views animals, and what we can do to improve  conditions for them. I am already a lover of nature and animals, but this  book opened my eyes to things I have not known or seen before. <br />This is  not a recommended reading for someone who does not appreciate the earth,  but for people whose hearts are ready to accommodate the creatures that  share with us the planet and are contributing more to our souls than we  realize.	2000-08-20

However, I was bothered by Grisham's ways of degrading the country in which  most of the story took place. I am not from Brazil or the US, but I do  sympathize with the Brazilians because Grisham has made a definite point of  making it look low, poor, dirty, and full of disease. He described its  people as being isolated from the modern world - and I'm not referring to  the tribes, but to the cities - and living in the past. Stating the facts  is one thing, but deliberate lingering over the negative details was a  turn-off. There is also a general negative tone that is carried throughout  the story, but it is quickly overridden by the fast pace of the action.   <br />It is a good story, interesting enough by taking place in the jungle,  but I don't see why Grisham wants to spread a negative viewpoint about  Brazil; there are other ways to make a story interesting without degrading  other countries.	2000-08-20

The second chapter explained the different genres of fiction, i.e. mainstream, romance, mystery, etc. Further along the book, I  found the book was most practical in its advice on preparing your final  draft and submitting it to publishers. <br />The second part of the book is  basically a biography covering the lives of several authors. Some were  quite interesting as they were compressed into two or three pages, such as  the careers of John Grisham, Stephen King, and Mary Higgins Clark. I do  admit those were very inspirational as well. <br />The disappointment was in  the long, extensive, and detailed biographies of George O'Toole, Steven  Linakis and a few others. I believe this was hardly relevant to the  subject; one may think they were included in the book for inspiration to  the reader, but the amount of detail that is put in there about the  authors' lives may tend to leave you wondering, &quot;He (Oscar) could've  said that in a page, why'd he use up 8 pages?&quot;	2000-06-25
