The projects are interesting and fun.  You can learn things from this book, but will certainly need to know some foundations and basics first.  Other books serve that purpose, however.  This isn't meant to be complex or a book to learn those things, of course.	2004-12-02
US	34469892	R1XYFREFG0XVPO	0596006284	759057457	Linux Pocket Guide	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Just as title promises.	This is a well rounded guide that gets right to the point and serves its purpose well.  With easily referenced material/subjects (that goes into even more detail when needed), you will likely find everything you'll need using in this one book, without the need for a 'bible' with a lot of discussions that are ultimately irrelevant to the information you seek.  A definite for a beginner, and a good reminder or reference on some subjects you may not have touched on over the years for those with experience.  And, for the size, this book has a lot and touches on many topics.  Well formatted and easy to follow.  Recommended.	2004-03-08

I could see this book saving new users a few months of finding out on their own and is a good reference book as well. It covers a lot of the need-to-know type of things. I've been using Linux for many years and still reference it sometimes.	2003-06-14

It really serves what it says it will. It covers a great amount of Perl coding, but like the title says, goes into a lot of networking code, functions and so on. For Perl network programming, you really should have and use this book.	2003-06-14
US	34469892	RYILEZG0XWPZX	0596005164	649415420	The Complete FreeBSD: Documentation from the Source	Books	5	26	28	N	N	This is *the* book to have on FreeBSD.	I've read a few FreeBSD books and coming from a background in *nix and *nix-type flavors, I've been let down before. Other books cover maybe a total of 20 commands and nothing you don't know the first day (and don't even have as much information as the man pages), but this one is different.<br />I wasn't on a *BSD system for a couple of years of mainly using Linux, and I wanted a refresher and for the book to cover new and familiar topics. Useful things, rather than just listing the popular software used on it and not the things you need to know about them, etc.<br />This book covers more than the others in regards to commands, common tasks, installs, configurations and so on. It actually covers the TOPIC (Being the FreeBSD OS). Not a quick and dirty run down of a few commands and a lot of fluff like other books. This gives you what you need to know, be it you have some experience or are new.<br />It doesn't skip around like the other books and only offer maybe a total of one decent chapter on the topic of the book (FreeBSD), it covers many chapters worth. I can't stand when a book only has some information about the title, as much as it does about some irrelevant third party software (and only talks about it as briefly at that).<br />I don't want or need information about anything other than what the book is about--and finally, a FreeBSD book that covers FreeBSD. I was impressed. It may not cover everything, but it sure gets close and is very professional, well structured and informative.<br />Between this book, man pages and online (and up to date) documentation, it's unlikely you will need (much) more information about how to install, configure and use FreeBSD, it's tools and programs and work in it daily and have the information you need. Trust me, this book is far better than the others (see my review on &quot;Absolute BSD: The Ultimate Guide to FreeBSD&quot; to see what I mean).	2003-06-14

Probably more than any other Perl book I've read. It's a great reference or to fill in the gaps other Perl books left out. I am not new to Perl and I have probably 20 Perl books--and being the Perl freak I am, I buy any additional books that have anything I can read--and this book is one of the top 4 or 5 most read Perl books. It covers a great deal of aspects, if you only get one or three Perl book(s) in total, this one is highly recommended.	2003-06-14

This book covers some cool tricks and tips and more efficient coding than some of the other Perl books. Few books I believe actually add to your knowledge and offer ideas and inspiration. For a Perl book after you've got some experience--or even not--this one's pretty good.	2003-05-21

Although I don't use Sendmail anymore, I still reference it when I support a server that runs it and it coveres everything a book shoudl cover about a topic. It doesn't get all generalized and go off into basic installs and configures of other software and things just to waste more trees, it does it's job and does it well. It's *the* Sendmail book.	2003-05-11

There's not a lot to be had from this book. They cover too much and discuss too much generalized topics and never really touch on any real-world working, intelligent firewall fules and uses. Just too much generalized fluff. You'll get more from a 'man page' on iptables and be able to put it to use, at least, compared to this. It is interesting, but there's too much generalization and fluff and not much someone can *use* from it.	2003-05-11

Not much there for C, although it's not too difficult to make use of the Perl topics and covert them to C, it's more geared towards Perl (much more). That's too bad. Still, it's a good book and is very useful for referencing as well as for people looking to learn more about this topic.	2003-05-11

This book is generalized, but in a good way (for once). Instead of a lot of fluff and only touching a little bit on various software and how to do the most basic stripped down installs of things that have little to do with Unix, other than it can \\"run\\" on a Unix system, it actually covers a lot of ground. It covers a lot of topics and aspects, like it should be expected. There's parts that could be improved and it's biased towards some platforms over others, but for general knowledge and insight, it can offer a lot.	2003-05-11

I've you've used BIND much at all and are familair with DNS and how it works a little, and have just read the install, readme, etc. files, you probably won't get much out of this book. BIND has a lot of options and there's a lot to discuss, but this book just covered a lot of basics over a lot of pages. It may be a good source for learning, but I wasn't reading it to learn from start.	2003-05-11

This coveres some aspects, and can be used to learn from--but doesn't cover all the aspects that you'll want to know. For a reference, it's pretty good too. It's a pretty decent book, though has a good mix of information that makes it a little better than average.	2003-05-11

If you are good with regular expressions and understand them, this just gives a lot of more detailed, specific and complex one's. That's not a bad thing, but it's not really something you'd have any reason to use and could be done just as accurately and efficiently with a lot less code. Some of them look impressive, but are just a lot of unneeded code for the sake of looking inpressive. A lot can be had from this book, I just already know regular expressions very well, but it's still inspiring.	2003-05-10

It barely covers much about FreeBSD, the OS and configurations. It covers some basic aspects, which may help someone that's never used a *nix variant--but other than that it covers a lot of basic stuff about Apache, Sendmail, etc.<br />Personally, if I buy a book about an OS, I want it to cover a lot about it. This had a total (what I can recall, at least it seemed) of about 20 commands, basic configuration and the rest was just fluff about Apache, Sendmail, etc.<br />I can't see this book being of much value. Condensed it would be a &quot;decent' one chapter worth of knowledge. This book doesn't have a lot of knowledge or information to obtain.<br />I have been using Linux and *nix variants for about 8 years, doing web server tasks. I haven't been on a FreeBSD system for a while now and got this book to brush up, see the differences, etc.<br />The problem was, even though at this point logging into a FreeBSD server feels a little alien to me, even after all these years since I've used one much, I can refer to this book for anything and I already know it.<br />Don't mistake that for me knowing more about it than I thought--there's a lot I don't know and this book didn't touch any of it. This is way too basic and for the size of it, you'd think it would at least cover more for someone starting in it with more information. I didn't see either value in this book.<br />Again, this book could be condensed into one chapter and it would only be a so-so chapter. It didn't cover any of the commonly used commands, other than ps and top and netstat, etc., it didn't get into anything helpful. Very basic, and very general and too much fluff. I took it back the same day--because flipping through the entire book, there was only a few things I forgot about.<br />It doesn't have much to offer, you can get all this information just as easily in the FreeBSD documentation at the FreeBSD site. This book may be good for beginners, or people like me, that just like to read and own books and try and soak up as much knowledge about the topic as they can, but only for someone very new to this... even then, I wonder the value.	2003-05-10

If you've used Apache without even reading about any detailed configurations, you'd still not see anything new in this book. I can see this book being a little useful for beginners, but even then, it's not really getting into very detailed information about the configurations and whatnot for module installs/additions. I can see someone new still getting frustrated with this book if they run into a problem.<br />I picked it up, well, because I buy every O'Reilly book that comes out (seriously) and thought I might be able to find something interesting, useful or that I wasn't aware of or forgot... maybe even a little tip about efficiency, compiling options or just anything of interest.<br />This is no more useful than the README and INSTALL files that come with Apache's source code. I'm not sure I want to even give this two stars come to think of it. I just don't see the point to this book. A let down coming from O'Reilly.	2003-05-10
