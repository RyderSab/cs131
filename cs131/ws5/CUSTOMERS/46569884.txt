Write from Your Heart is a grief workbook journal that truly helped me to sort my feelings and to write about my love and my loss.The stories, verses and healing activities encourage me.<BR> I'm dealing with individuals who have hurt me with things they have said or done. Our family's loss feels so great to us. I feel as though I am unburdening myself without burdening other family members when I can sort things out in my book. I am stronger using this journal. Writing in and reading this journal is calming for me. <BR>I would like to also recommend this journal for anyone who wants to create a keepsake of a loved one. This book is for anyone who wants to write about their lives, emotions and memories. You don't have to be a professional writer to use this book. It is written in an easy to use format. It also had some helpful healing activities that I am finding useful.<BR>This is a book that requires you to do something which is write and that is what gets you through grief. You must do your &quot;griefwork&quot; if you ever want to begin to heal.<BR>Go ahead and begin to heal with your own copy. <BR>May you all find the healing power of God.	2002-04-17

I can see that the author has come through the loss of her husband, parents, siblings, and other family members and friends and still has a strong faith and courage. <BR>   My life isn't over and I know I have a lot still to experience and to offer others. As is quoted in the book Helen Keller, said &quot;Self pity is our worst enemy and if we yield to it we can never do anything wise in this world.&quot;<BR>   I have my days when I feel down but the journal is helpful to me in many ways. Some days I feel like writing and other days I just want to read the verses and suggestions.<BR>  I am going to send a copy to my friend who just lost her husband. I know she will find comfort using it as I have.<BR>  I was anxious for my book to arrive because I wanted to find comfort. Grief is a process and I think this journal will help me through that process.	2002-03-16

Write from Your Heart, A Healing Grief Journal. It is a grief workbook that we are using at our church grief class.	2002-02-17

Books	2	17	30	N	N	Fiction	I was reading the reviews, and I must agree with the person who wrote that the book tends to come from the fairy tale or New Age slant. <BR>I disagree with some points, and I don't want my children to be misled on such a serious subject.<BR>You don't get to heaven by being good. We could never be that good. How do you know when you are good enough? This is not the true teaching of the Christian faith. <BR>We are saved by grace.<BR>The next point wat that everyone goes to heaven. Where did she come up with these ideas?<BR>Another point I found that ventured too far from the truth was the section with the animals that were seperated from regular heaven by a white picket fence. <BR>I guess if Maria marketed her book under fiction it would be alright to put it out there for the children.<BR>I like Maria, but I have purchased other grief products that dealt more realistically with the subject.<BR>  My children trust me to tell them the truth. This is no time for Easter Bunny stories. The truth is hard, but it is better that they know. There is peace in knowing the truth. It will stand by them the rest of their lives.<BR>  I did like the cover art though. <BR>Give it another try .....	2002-01-26

This one has cocoa and oats with other ingredients. I supervise this recipe because the butter has to be melted.<BR>  I must mention one more fun recipe.

Can you forgive those who let you down?<BR> While at the time people said some insensitive remarks, &quot;aren't you over it yet?&quot; that hurt deeply. Other people came forward that I never expected would. Those special people were a great blessing. I recommend this journal especially if you like to write, or if you want to create a loving memory book or if you just want to get your feelings on paper. It also had some helpful healing activities scattered amongst the prompts.<BR>You will get out of this book what you put into it. Take the time to write.
