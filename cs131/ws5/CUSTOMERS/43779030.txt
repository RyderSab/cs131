The Hero, Gianni, is pompous and full of himself but actually likeable, he has the best interests of a baby girl at heart and even if his ego is extremely battered he still come out looking good. Briana, our heroine, on the other hand was immature, rude to the point of being disgraceful, and completely unable to see that someone else might know best.<br /><br />If this had been the first in the series, I doubt I would have read the rest. However, the others ARE worth reading and highly enjoyable.<br /><br />I do not wish to give too much of the story away but from start to finish Briana is selfish and immature. I found it very hard to find her likable. The passion is great and the love for the little girl is Briana's redeeming quality.<br /><br />3 stars for a series that I liked was disappointed in its end.<br /><br />The books in the series are<br /><br />Keir O'Connell's Mistress (Keir O'Connell's Story)<br /><br />The Sicilian Surrender (Fallon O'Connell's Story)<br /><br />Claiming His Love-Child (Cullen o'Connell's Story)<br /><br />The Sheikh's Convenient Bride (Megan O'Connell's Story)<br /><br />The One -Night Wife (Sean O'Connell's Story)<br /><br />The Sicilian Marriage (Briana O'Connell's Story)	2005-10-02

He wanted to convince a young girl with and obsessive crush on him that he was in love with someone else...<br /><br />But after sharing a room--and a bed--Dan and Megan suddenly become overwhelmingly attracted to each other! In fact, they were so convincing as lovers they'd even made mad, passionate love. The problem was their pretense was supposed to STOP the moment they wer back at work...<br /><br />COMMENTS<br /><br />This was really another story of a girl being mousy and when she makes an effort with her appearence then the Boy takes notice. The characters are likable and you can see why they could be together. The teenage crush is reasonable to the story as well.<br /><br />What made me give this three stars instead of more were the random places that the story went, that just deadended, places that could have been used to futher the story, as the reader thinks its going too, but it ends up going no where.<br /><br />Also the behavior of both Megan adn Dan when the weekend is over is childish and didn't paint either of them in a good light.<br /><br />But the friend Jake, WHom I hope has his own story, is very likable as an unlikely cupid.	2005-09-30

Unlike the other review, I didn't find the heroine Cara whinny, just locker within herself. She was trying hopelessly to not fall apart at the seams and to do that she had to lock herself way from anything that could hurt her. Including the man who loves her.<br /><br />Byron, comes from an overpoweringly close knit family and can not understand that Cara can not cope with it. He tries hard to make her come out of her shell, unsuccessfully. I agree that the book was too short and could only have been better in a longer story. But in the time alotted I did enjoy the story, felt for the characters, cried with Cara at one point, and then cheered for the ending.<br /><br />To me that amounts to 4 stars. There was a lot of growth in the characters, even if some of that growth was forced at the end.<br /><br />Enjoyable quick read.	2005-09-29

But her heart sank when she saw the boss--because she'd met Kane Marshall before....<br /><br />However, Kane hired Jessie there and then; he wanted to get to know her better! But though nine-til-five Jessie was at Kane's bidding, after hours she definitely wasn't for bedding!<br /><br />This is Miranda Lee at her best, slight twists and turns around many a corner, keep her books interesting and fun to read. These characters of Kane and Jessie also have depth to them. Jessie's main concern is working to support her young daughter, who the reader loves immediately. Kane's main concern is that he wants to care for them both.<br /><br />The book starts a bit slowly but if you can get through those first ten pages its speeds along from there. Kane is great at breaking slowly through Jessie's barrier wall and does so with a passion and care that makes me want to work for him.<br /><br />Over all a really good read, for those who love the PRESENTS line.	2005-09-28

He'd given her sweet words of Protection, and trust, and love--and then he'd left her. She was going to tell him about the baby when he came back...but he never did.<br /><br />Now Megan's son is a teenager and Darrow is back in her life! He believes the lie she's told about the husband she never had- she made it up to protect her son and save her pride. But why does the story anger him so much? And what was the truth behind their break up all those years ago?<br /><br />This is one of those books that had potential, but lost it. There was too much the author was trying to accomplish in the 187 pages she had. Everything that happened in this book could have been avoided if one of the two characters had picked up the phone 13 years earlier.<br /><br />This book screams lack of communication. Letters stopped coming so Meg assumed Darrow had broken up with her. She sent a letter saying she was thinking about accepting fictious man's proposal and when no letter came in response she lef the town. She didn't tell Darrow she was pregnant because he has the chance for a scholarship and she didn't want him to turn it down, It was for a year away. Did Meg forget to count that that meant 12 months away and that the baby would be four months old when he returned? Darrow's own mother lived in the same town, yet Meg never goes and talks with her either.<br /><br />To add to this plot, we also have to deal with Meg closing up her dead mother's house, a father she never knew, a son who has been very ill, Darrow not wanting to write anymore and there is more.<br /><br />Darrow is likable though his reason for not writing to Megan, though plausible, doesn't really fly and I wasn't ever certain he had actually broken up with Megan. Megan is too defensive, she bites that her son can do anything but he has just come out of the Hospital, so it's conflicting. The whole book is wrapped up in the last 2 pages including Darrow finding out Luke is his son. I kept thinking there must be missing pages.<br /><br />Personally, there are better books by this author.'s conflicting.

Some of the usual plots used by Harliquin writers but Carol Marinelli gives them abit of a twist.<br /><br />I don't want to give any of the story away, though I believe most readers will of course figure it all out in the first few chapters. But its a story about forgiveness and finding love. Its also about two polar opposites finding each other.<br /><br />As I said this is a different kind of love story one that I think incorporates many of the things that are going on today. If you are looking for a traditional love story this is proably not the one for you. But if you are looking for something new and alittle different with a modern theme then give this one a read.	2005-08-01

This time our Dark Hunter is a Woman, (Hurray finally) Danger and our Hero is Alexion, who can best be described as \\"other\\"<br /><br />`Sins of the Night' follows what happens when Dark Hunters go Rogue or Bad. Alexion is the man who is sent to judge whether they can be saved or if they will die and become Shades. Obviously, this is a love story about Alexion and Danger but the underlying story is powerful and answers many of those questions DH fans have been screaming for.<br /><br />We learn more about the Elusive Acheron and his 'Daughter' Simi. We also learn more about how the who Dark Hunter thing evolved. However, if you are looking for all those old familiar characters from other books you will be disappointed. A few are discussed but only a handful of secondary characters from previous books actually surface in this one.<br /><br />This book had me riveted and I enjoyed it greatly but compare to her other DH books this one isn't one of my top three, but it's a definite keeper for my library one that I am sure I will reread again and again. This book made me laugh, grimace and I definitely cried at the end.<br /><br />Now I can only wait, with baited breath, for the next one to be released.	2005-06-29

Then The Countess (HIS GODMOTHER) quickly lets Carrie know that Luc no longer wants her and that it would be best if she left immediately.<br /><br />OF coarse in any book like this it is rare that the messenger is telling the truth. But so begins the story.<br /><br />Many years later Carrie is forced to go back to the Princes Island to break some news to the Countess, but instead she has to break the news to the prince himself. With in pages Carrie finds herself blackmailed into marriage with the Prince.<br /><br />This book had so much potential and at the beginning, I was pulled in. But very shortly Carrie's acid tongue got to be too much. Yes, she is being blackmailed, but everything is turned into a battle. I love a book with good tension and word play. But Carrie came off as harsh, unkind and full of hot air.<br /><br />Luc on the other hand is caught between state affairs and Carrie. He doesn't trust her and does a lot of underhanded things in the name of country. He is also very naive where his godmother goes.<br /><br />Once you get to the wedding this book is crammed with too much stuff that it makes your head spin. And there is never satisfaction that the Countess has been found out. At least give the reader the chance to see the old bag put down.<br /><br />Okay book wish the last half wasn't so rushed.	2005-04-07

But that was easier said then done when in seemed that the only way to calm a family crisis at Christmas was for Cassie and Nick to pretend to pretend to be engaged!<br /><br />Well, Nick decided it was and Cassie knew she must go along with him, for the sake of their two little nieces. If she, didn't Alice and Emily might have their Christmas ruined.<br /><br />If only Nick wasn't insisting that his mistletoe make-believe with Cassie look as convincing as possible, complete with kisses and a ring. Pretty soon she found herself wishing it was for real after all.<br /><br />MY REVIEW<br /><br />Nick is the perfect alpha Hero. He is protecting everyone and taking charge. He is strong and caring, from the beginning his attraction to Cassie is evident, and her lack of trust in him, is tearing him apart.<br /><br />Cassie through a string of disastrous relationships both her own and around her has very little faith in the male species and none more so then the Seymour brothers. Her Brother in law MAX has treated her sister Julia horribly and Cassie honestly believes that Nick is in love with Julia. While she has had a secret crush on Nick for years.<br /><br />The story revolves mainly around Cassie's lack of trust in Nick. Nick who freely admits to a bout of Puppy love when he was younger for Julia finds it hard to combat the frequent accusations on the part of Cassie about his feeling for her sister.<br /><br />This book is well worth the read, although Cassie's accusations get old after awhile you never quiet feel like she is a weak whinny female. And for once the story didn't resolve it self in the last few pages but took its time to resolve itself little by little.	2005-03-09

But Pippa can't let the barriers drop. She tells herself that all the things that were against them then still hold true now. However, Randal is determined to prove at least one thing--that Pippa wants him too.<br /><br />WHERE DO I START? Let's start with Pippa, a woman who grew up in an orphanage and now cannot seem to take risks. She constantly runs away. When the going gets Tuff Pippa gets running.<br /><br />Then there is Randal who when he first makes a pass at Pippa he is both her boss and he is Married. But what truly makes it hard is that although he proclaims his love early he will not take no for an answer. Even when they are about to have sex she says no, (although we are told her body is saying something else) he doesn't stop he begs.<br /><br />The book revolves around Randal chasing and begging and Pippa promising she won't run and then as soon as his back is turned she bolts.<br /><br />The whole book is resolved in the last two paragraphs. Hardly satisfying, with too many questions left unanswered.	2005-03-08

But, when his family gives him an ultimatum to marry within three months or lose his inheritance, he's forced to find a bride...<br /><br />Louise Trentham is instantly wary when Alex Fabian proposes: he's formidably dynamic, gorgeous__and way out of her league! But the chemistry between them is rresistible. Can Louise take the plunge and say, \\"I do,\\" knowing that, for Alex, she'll always be only his token wife?<br /><br />My Review<br /><br />There is a lot against Alex and Louisa in the beginning mainly they are engaged to other people. So to see them come together and eventually fall in love in 180 pages may seem a stretch but Sara Craven does it well.<br /><br />This book is full of turmoil and tension, lots of uncertainty and finally glowing love.  He must learn to love she must learn to trust again and together they find it. The only fault I have with the book and the reason for it not getting 5 stars, is that I would have liked some closure with her family. They treat her rottenly and that is never settled.<br /><br />Other wise it's a good quick read.	2005-03-08

According to the baby's birth certificate, Jodie was the child's next of kin-- but Morgan knew he was the baby's real father. Unless Morgan acted, Jodie would get custody-- and he would lose his precious son...<br /><br />But the attraction between Jodie and Morgan was overwhelming... the passion explosive. Perhaps there was a way for Morgan to keep his son: Marriage!<br /><br />From the back cover I was some how expecting something totally different then what I got when I read this book. It was a pleasant surprise. Jodie is a woman just leaving her live in relationship with her boy friend in New York and has decided to finally meet her birth father in England event though she hasn't heard from him in the 6 months since he first contacted her.<br /><br />Morgan is living in Sam's, Jodie's fathers, house watching the baby he knows is his but the world thinks is Sam's. The problem is Sam has been in the hospital since his fianc&eacute;e and the baby's mother died in a car accident 5 weeks prior.<br /><br />Problems arise because, Dam does not want to see Jodie, he thinks that Jodie never contacted him, Jodie's is stubborn and Morgan is afraid to lose his son and more afraid to break Sam's heart, Sam having acted like a surrogate father to Morgan as a boy growing up.<br /><br />Given all this the book is a great read full of emotion and passion. The characters are lovable and down to earth. My major two issues in the book are small first if Jodie grew up in America some of the terms she used just aren't used here. For instance \\"Daily's\\" may be the day help in England but that term is almost never used here. My other issue was with Jodie's stubbornness she refuses at one point to leave her fathers house saying that she has more right to be there then Morgan does. She has yet to even meet father yet.<br /><br />Otherwise the book is a quick enjoyable read. That I will probably pick up and reread again.probably pick up and reread again. <br />	2005-02-16

Adam decides to invite him to stay with him at his exclusive Caribbean villa, where the sensual days and steamy nights will surely lead to her surrender.<br /><br />OK the front picture has nothing to so with the book, yes the couple attend the opera but they are there separately and it is before the two are even offically introduced. Two yes he invited her to his Villa but what the back of the book neglects to say is that the invitation is also from his 13 year old daughter.<br /><br />He also is never really infurated by Rosalie.

This is really a great love story one that involved blended familys and learning that family is everything.<br /><br />The best part is the end pure love that Adam had for Rosalie.

But his reaction was devastating...<br /><br />Unraveling old family secrets was the only way Isabelle could get Jacques back. But would anyone be willing to expose the truth?<br /><br />FIRST let me say the back is a bit misleading. Although Isabelle does try to uncover the secrets at the beginning she does little after her secret is out in the open. The majority of the book is Jacques and Isabelle fighting their ever growing attraction to each other because of Jacques loyality to his father. WHom he has always beleived would have been a doctor,instead of a cheese seller, if Isabelle's father hadn't stolen his finace and money from Jacques grandfather.<br /><br />Jacques loyality to his family is the major focus in this story as he try's hard not to love Isabelle. It is as much a story about the family and its mystery as it is a love story.	2005-01-10

All the other reviews give you the run down of the story so I won't go into that again. But what I will say is that this one is another keeper. The more SK writes the better she gets.<br /><br />I love that we saw all our beloved friends from past books and that it felt like it was natural, not like she was forcing the meeting to allow us a glimpse of our favorites. But because of this new reader to SK might get confussed by the every growing list of Characters that spring up.<br /><br />I do believe that you can read this book on its own but personally I would read them in order. Reading Kyrian's book first NIGHT PLEASURES is a must to understand the animosity between Kyrian and Valerius without feeling like Kyrian is just a jerk. (Whom I love of course)Not to mention the fact that our Herione and Kyrian are in-laws because Tabitha's twin sister is married to Kyrian.<br /><br />Tabitha and Valerius might be opposites but they definately attract. Tabitha is proably the strongest of the heroines to date and she would need to be for the battles that SK had instore for her and Valerius.<br /><br />I was interested to see how SK would make a Dark Hunter that had been portrayed in such a way that the reader would hate him in the precious books into a hero we would love. LET ME TELL YOU SHE SUCCEEDED.<br /><br />In this book there is also a lot of set up for up coming novels. Oh I can just taste them.<br /><br />A must read but with the warning that it will be much more enjoyable read in the order it was meant to be read.	2005-01-06

Nick Destry comes to the rescue. He makes certain that she does not forget that this is a marriage in name only.<br />The story starts after the couple has separated; they have been separated since their honeymoon. Much of the story is told in Paige's memory and the entire story in her point of view. I personally prefer a story that lets me see what the Hero is thinking.<br />Because the story is completely in Paige's point of view we never quiet see why she suddenly decides to forgive him his atrocious behavior.  The reconciliation happens as usual in the last 20 pages but we are thrown another twist, which is never completely resolved. They simply seem to through it under the rug.<br />Ms Craven's story is a great writer and you feel for Paige's plight. But she needed at least another couple of chapters to end the book in a way that would have justified it all.	2004-05-20

She is also a woman who trust few and has been scorned in the past.<br />The story starts a bit slow but eventually picks up momentum.  The hardest part of the book for me to take was the princess, who by all accounts is used to getting her way. But her apology for leaving her husband with little more then a note, in the middle of the night, leaves a lot to be desired.  She even goes as far to demand to know why he didn't follow her. My thought, you walked out on him.  HMMMM.<br />Our Heroine does eventually redeem herself and by the end is highly likable and to my thinking finally deserving of our hero.  The story also has some interesting twists that keep the action rising, though the reader will figure most of it out quickly.<br />If you like Victoria Alexander then you will enjoy this one; if this is your first attempt with this Author I would start with one of her other works first.	2004-01-27

It's number nine of the series and fourth from the end.  If you are worried that you need to read the rest of the series to enjoy this one, don't.  This book stands on its own.  There may be a few odd moments where information about the other books is added.  (Each book builds the story of the abandoned then kidnapped baby Lena, all cultivate in the finale Texas...Now and Forever by Merline Lovelace)<br />In this Story we meet Joe, all around good guy, who ends up marrying Ginger, waitress at the Lone Star Country Club, to help her stay in the country.  The love story is charming, he thinks he is too old and she deserves better.  She thinks she isn't worthy of him.<br />The book takes some twists and turns, keeping the reader guessing.  Although some problems seemed to resolve themselves a little too quickly for my taste.  Then again Judy Christenberry can only do so much in such a short amount of pages.<br />If you are a Harlequin \\"Blaze\\" reader this will be a little too tame for your tastes, but if you are looking for sweet, charming story, this is the book for you.	2003-12-10

Although I strongly recommend reading the books that preclude this story, it is not necessary.  The reader will be able to follow the story line with out much fuss.  For those who have read the series this is the finale you've been waiting for.<br />Finally all the secrets are revealed, baby Lena's parents will reunite and rescue there daughter together.  That is of course if Haley can finally tell the truth about who she is and if Luke can forgive her.  But can two people facing the worst of odds, the mafia, Luke's blindness, and deceptions, come together and work if out for the sake of there baby girl?<br />This is an exciting book filled with adventure, intrigue and great love scenes.  The characters come to life and are so likable you would forgive them anything.  Ms Lovelace did a fantastic job sewing up the series and leaving the reader satisfied with the results.<br />I highly recommend the entire series but this book as one of the best.	2003-12-10

Not only are our hero and Heroine, likable and faulted as all good characters are, but they have substance and we really truly see the attraction coming off the pages.<br />Tyler Murdoch one of the Golfing Fab Four from the Lone Star Country Club is heading into the jungle of Central America to rescue his former commanding officer, unfortunately he gets stuck with Marisa Rodriquez.  Tyler does not work with Woman, past history a woman has done him wrong, and Marissa does not trust men, past history a man has done herwrong.<br />But when these two get stranded and have to learn to work together and lean on one another, opinions change rapidly.<br />Set in Central America a location not often used in Romance, it was intriguing and fresh.  I just wish I hadn't read the last two books first.<br />Highly recommend this book and this series.	2003-10-23

Unlike the other books the information given here is not thrown in your face to make you read more.  This book stands on its own.  That being said a reader should definitely get there hands on the rest of the series.<br />Heart Doctor Michael O'Day nearly runs over the feisty Prima Ballerina Susan Wainwright with his car. The Doctor loves nothing better then a feisty woman.  Unfortunately her heart is weak, she needs the best doctor and that is Michael.  The story is a sweet love affair, about an independent woman faced with her own immortality, and the thought of facing a new and different life and her Doctor who is madly and quickly blurring the lines of the Doctor Patient relationship.<br />For those who have read the rest of the LSCC series you will see many a family face for those that this is a first try, I highly recommend giving the other residents of LSCC a try.	2003-10-21

He is not too happy.  There break up was not a good one when she walked out five years ago and seeing her again let alone working together is not going to be easy.  But for the sake of Kidnapped baby Lena he will make it work.<br />This is the 3rd book in the Lone Star Country Club series that I have read, but I believe it is the 2nd to the last in the series itself.  The book has a lot of characters in it that have been introduced in previous stories but this does not distract from the book.  Some readers may feel as if not all the conflicts have been resolved in this story but like a season cliffhanger they are resolved in the next book, Texas...Now and forever.<br />The story itself is a good one the characters are well written and you can understand the paint that they fell although at point the reader may wish to slap one if not both of our leading characters.  The important thing is that the reader cares about the couple.  I personally could not put it down until I found out how they resolved their issues.<br />I would recommend reading the series as a whole but if you don't this is still worth the read.	2003-10-19

Though I think it's the Fifth in the actually series over all. After having read PROMISED TO A SHEIK I am now very anxious to read the rest.<br />The story of the invisible twin taking the place of the more popular and outgoing twin may be one I have seen over and over in Romances but it takes a nice twist in this story as she actually marries the man before telling him who she is.  None of this is a surprise if you read the back cover.  Two twins with the same first name of Elizabeth have been writing to Sheik Omar.  When Fiona gets bored, as she has a tendency to do, Cara, the shy invisible twin, takes over the letter writing. In the process pours her heart and soul out to a man that she is highly infatuate led with and has been since the cotillion several years before. So begins the courtship of Cara and Omar.  Only the problem occurs when Omar arrives to propose to Cara.<br />This is a sweet and tender story that I thoroughly enjoyed.  Not only will I be reading the rest of the Lone Star series but I hope to grab some of this authors other works.<br />Side note if you intend to read only this book there are several references to characters that flow through out the series. Having read the last book first I knew the characters but I felt those who had not read the series might find it a little jarring in the mist of Cara and Omar's story.	2003-10-19

When I heard they were doing an anthology together I thought what could be better.  Well the answer is that all these Novellas should have been full length books.  I really was left wanting more.  That I beleive is a good thing.  If you have never read anything by these three authors this may not be the place to start.<br />All three book pick up hero's from previous books. Lisa Kleypas Charachters come from &quot;Dreaming of you&quot; and &quot;Then came you&quot; Jake is also found in few others, Kinley McGregor's Simon can be found In &quot;Master of Desire&quot; and &quot;Born in SIn&quot;  and Julia Quinn's Hero can be found previously in Spendid and Dancing at Midnight.  SO you might feel as if you  have missed something if you pick up there stories here and quite frankly you have missed something.<br />For those of you who have read the other books its always nice to see favorite characters again and find out what happened to those supporting characters you always liked.  A good read leaving you wanting a little bit more.	2003-10-07

Definately a great surprise.  Ok so our Heroine is a highclass courtesan, but you will need to read the book to find out why and you will fall in love with her.  The duke is also very lovable.  Though very much on his high horse at the beginning. It through his love for Bell and her love for Hawk that they are both able to over come demons and society. I don't want to tell any more then that because it would just give it away.<br /><br />This book has everything I love in a story, likable characters, laughter, tears and frustration.  A great read that you won't be able to put down.	2003-10-07

Though I enjoyed the 1st book in the series, A LADY CHOOSEN there was alot of background needed to get the reader up to speed. I feel with the second book, this book, that SL was able to focus on the story line and the hero and heroine more.<br />As always  Alicia is a strong and independent SL Heroine and is not likely to let our hero Tony come in and just save the day, not with out her knowing what is going on. We get to know more of the members of the Bastion club, sort of wetting our appitites for the books to come.<br />SL also brings back characters from her Cynster series, nice to see characters we love before they are married, as well as the hero and heroine from her book \\"Captain Jacks Woman\\" Though its nice if you have read CJW it is not nessesary to enjoy \\"A Gentleman Honor.\\" If you like SL you will more then like enjoy this book too.	2003-10-06

This is the second of her books I have read and will be the last. First of all someone must not have read the book before they did the art work on the inside cover. First of all the western/Montana scene and dress depicted is not at all what it looks like in New Orleans or Regency England. Ok now to the book. I felt there was too many story lines happening at once, quite frankly i see no reason why the story needed to return to the US. There is really no conclusion where are hero relealizes how he has wronged Amie our heroine, no he just climbs back into her bed yet again and she welcomes him.<br />Holt, our hero treats her like garbage on more then one occasion then ruins her more then once, but never appologizes, heck she never even gets to explain.<br />I felt completely unsatisfied and by the end really couldn't have cared less.	2003-10-06

Set in Medieval Scotland time of arranged marriages and marrying to increase ones clan, or protect it, Scottish bride is just that, two very far fetched lovers thrown together to save a clan and prevent a war. Lillias McGinnis our leading lady seems to put her foot in it at every turn and Iain McLeod our hero after a nine year absence seems unable to see it coming.  I found the story slow and too far fetched.  Not to mention the number of times I became embarassed to be female.	2003-04-24
