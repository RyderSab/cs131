This book is detailed and provides a lot of the inside story, all the while remaining impartial, which was not made known to the public.  Crier's book distinguishes itself from all the other Peterson-related books primarily due to the professional perspective which this was written.<br /><br />One of the most intriguing parts of the book are the photographs used in evidence throughout the trial.  Again, this information was not made public in the duration of the actual trial, so having access to this critical information simply reinforces the jury's verdict that Peterson was guilty of murder.<br /><br />An outstanding, fascinating and enjoyable read!	2005-04-24

Rarely do we hear the behind the scenes story regarding a certain strategy utilized by a specific candidate, but this book divulges just that and much more!<br /><br />A fascinating read for those who enjoy studying the political campaigning processes and history!  One would do well to read this book and to learn from the strategies that worked and didn't work over the years.  This book covers a wide array of domains in the political campaigning process - ranging from the financial aspects of running for office (\\"money is the mother's milk of politics\\" may hold true, but stories here also defy this very notion), the impact of television and media in deciding the fate of certain candidates, how dirty tricks either worked or backfired, how candidates recoup from a setback they've created themselves, and so on.<br /><br />This book holds many treasured stories of the politicians we so revered (or didn't!) and their hearts, minds and souls in action.  A treasure for those who have a passion for political campaigns.	2004-11-09

This is a book that one can truly laugh outloud while reading, only if they've met the following two criteria: 1.)  they've read the DaVinci Code and 2.) they are up to speed on all the happenings in Washington, DC and the political arena.  If you have not met these two criteria, then the book will not seem as enjoyable or as funny.<br /><br />The author has brilliantly masterminded a way to incorporate the similar twists from the DaVinci Code into a political thriller/parody.  This is an easy reading, which can be read in one sitting (well, depending on how many times you have to stop reading because you're laughing so hard...) and is well worth the time!	2004-10-07

Given his own background as a Congressman during the Gingrich era, and his political affiliations, one cannot complete this book and not call Scarborough a true patriot.  He kept his word and served in the House with integrity.  A rare breed these days, unfortunately, and he makes no secret of his disapproval for the way Washington is currently operating.<br /><br />He makes it quite clear that the Republican Party is no longer standing by its own ideological beliefs, but rather is spending astronomical amounts of money to fund programs which are not truly benefitting the American public.  Too much pork-barreling is happening, as well as too much backscratching.  Scarborough was one man who tried to make a difference, but the numbers clearly overpowered him.  The lobbyists, the powerhouses on the Hill, and all those affiliated with special interest groups are the ones really running America.<br /><br />We need more Joe Scarboroughs in Congress.  The more people we can get, who recognize and live up to their duties as legislators, then perhaps the better a chance we stand in turning our country around for the better.<br /><br />It's actually quite scary, to not really know what back door deals are being brokered in the congresspeople's self-interest of being re-elected.  I think all of our legislators need to read this book, and as a supplement, watch \\"Mr. Smith goes to Washington\\" as a refresher for being a honest and admirable public servant.	2004-09-13

The book has been made out of a cardboard style design, with each page in color and horizontal composition.  While this book is not quite as powerful as \\"Maus,\\" it still resonates a strong feeling in my heart and mind regarding September 11th.<br /><br />There are some references to \\"Maus\\" throughout Spiegelman's newest book as he attempts to show some parallels between the eerie atmosphere surrounding NYC and Auschwitz.  This book certainly is bold in some respects, with an image of President Bush and Vice-President Cheney flying on an eagle, and Cheney slitting the Eagle's throat with a boxcutter while Bush sais \\"Let's Roll!\\" and the Eagle saying \\"Why do they hate us?  Why???\\"<br /><br />Spiegelman mostly writes of his journey in locating his teenage daughter at a school 6 blocks from the World Trade Center, but also incorporates some images of life in NYC.<br /><br />This book is, by far, very partisan, as opposed to \\"Maus\\" which is more narrative and does not present such an obvious bias.  \\"In the Shadow of No Towers\\" is an interesting book, to say the least, but not one that I would recommend others read because the substance is lacking, in my opinion.<br /><br />But then again, to each their own.........  Read on and you be the judge!	2004-09-08

Rauch gives excellent pointers, followed by personal examples or experiences, and then goes back to the pointer he was initially attempting to make.<br />Examples of such pointers include:<br />&quot;To win a seat in your local government it is helpful to have distinguished youself by doing something that is a significant sector of the electorate wanted to see done.&quot; (p.3)<br />&quot;It is never good in public life to become angry, especially when you are about to address hundreds to people.  While it is sometimes beneficial to appear to be shocked or outraged, it is a big mistake to let actual anger, which is self-indulgent, overwhelm your tactical saavy.&quot; (p.14)<br />&quot;You cannot win alone.  And the friends you choose to help you win will be yours for a long time, so choose them carefully.&quot; (p. 37)<br />&quot;There is no such thing as noncontroversial money in politics.  If you use your own, you may later be criticized for &quot;buying&quot; the election.  If you use someone else's, you may later be criticized for having been &quot;bought&quot; by your contributor.  Yet it is also said with considerable justification that &quot;money is the mother's milk of politics.&quot;&quot; (p. 47)<br />&quot;Local government is the government that is closest to the people.  Local government officials, then, have the opportunity to make changes that are felt immediately by the people.&quot; (p. 57)<br />&quot;Campaigns test this quality - grace under pressure - as well.&quot; (p. 60)<br />&quot;This is not to say, however, that the little known unfortunate things there are about your opponent should be concealed from the electorate.  Just the opposite.  The more of her dirty laundry that can be hung out, the better it is for you.  It is just that none of it should be hung by you.&quot; (p. 64)<br />&quot;In the end, all you can do is be yourself, and in the end that's all your constituents want you to be.  They can smell a phony a mile away.  And phonies don't get elected.&quot; (p. 111)<br />Those are just a few of the many tips Rauch has shared in the book.

Slowly, but surely, I am learning that there are certain truths in our lives that we will not see in the form of &quot;facts&quot; or the like.  This book is proof in itself, that even a world-renowned psychiatrist who relied on the scientific evidence in his profession for many years was able to see beyond such evidence and actually believe it.<br />The book is a documentation of the journey in discovering past lives, as experienced by a noted psychiatrist and his patient.<br />Beware - extremely logical people will find their own principles defied in this book!

She holds nothing back - and is genuine in the process.  The author certainly has a delightful sense of humor and the mere reading of her book reminds us that we all need to laugh at ourselves from time to time, especially if we want to be happy in our lives.<br />The style of prose is quite humorous and the imagery very vivid.  I intend to have my students read chapters of her book and analyze the writing style - for it is an outstanding model for such a task.<br />Be forewarned, though, not every essay is as intriguing as the others.

The only reason why I read this book is because my mother and father got it as a Christmas gift for me.  Of course, I'd seen this book a trillion times, in the bookstore, but never even thought about reading it because I mostly read non-fiction genre.  However, I basically finished this book in one reading - during my returning flight from New York to California.  I couldn't believe that I actually was going to pass up reading this book!  I phoned my mother as soon as I got into California, to thank her for giving me that book!<br />Basically the book is a suspense novel about the inner-workings of the Secret Societies and the role of such organization(s) as they pertain to a murder which transpired in the Louvre museum.  Once you start reading this book, you cannot possibly put it down!  Granted, there are portions that are quite deep insofar as the level of research involved - especially in regards to the Secret Societies and Art History - however, it is an incredibly fascinating storyline!<br />You do not need to have background understanding of the Secret Societies or Art History, though it would be quite helpful, because the author has eloquently written in a manner which is quite accessible to the &quot;rookie&quot; as well as the &quot;veteran.&quot;<br />Although this book is supposedly in the fiction category, one can't help but wonder how much of the operations of the Secret Societies is actually non-fiction!<br />You be the judge!	2003-12-30

One will find information about sightseeing, shopping, dining, activities, etc.<br />I picked this book instead of Frommer's or any of the other travel books because Grant made it quite clear that she personally went to each and every place that is in this book - so she didn't merely compile the listings of businesses along the Cape, she went and saw them each with her own eyes.  Hence, the book has more of a personal touch to it.  It is quite evident that Grant spent a great deal of time putting together the valuable information which comes in pretty handy for those touring the Cape.<br />An excellent resource indeed!!

Ehrenreich takes a journey in Key West, Minnesota and Maine, to work minimum wage jobs and she writes of her experiences in these positions.  It truly is amazing to read about the things people do to get by in life, to live day in and day out, on minimum wage jobs.<br />While it gives me some hope that welfare reform actually has the potential to succeed, it also is a disappointment to see such reality in the economical gap, especially in America, between the blue-collar workers and others.<br />Now, when I see janitors, hotel workers, and waitresses, I am more careful not to rush to judgement - instead I am thankful for their perseverance in life.<br />It is a very good book - a modern product of muckraking at its best.	2003-06-29

Fact: America is operated by a small group of individuals better known as the &quot;elites.&quot;<br />Granted we may live in a democratic society, but truth be told, it is not the millions of common people who have the power - it is those filthy rich people who have money and connections - that run the country.  James Madison is probably rolling over in his grave, for when he wrote the Federalist Paper #10, he feared what the majority would do to the minority.  Madison had it all wrong - it's the minority that does the controlling of the majority.<br />Mills book is a powerful read!  This is a book that brings a moment of enlightment insofar as to understanding the extent of power the elites possess and the impact of such power in our system.<br />Mandatory reading for all political science majors and people who are interested in pursuing endeavors in the field of politics.	2003-02-18

The book includes intriguing narratives of 50 random individuals, from all walks of life, seeking the ultimate question of life: What is our purpose, here, on this earth?  What is our calling? What do we need to do in order to be true to ourselves?<br />For those who wish to read of others experiences in life, insofar as seeking the answers to what we are meant to do, this book is quite resourceful and enjoyable.  After all, it is in most of us to wonder what truly makes us content with life - so what a better way to embark on the journey by reading thoughts of those who have travelled down similar roads of our own.<br />Granted, some stories are more interesting than others, but all contain worthwhile and thought-provoking questions for us to ponder over.<br />Don't expect to find answers in this book - at least not in the form of &quot;what to do&quot; list - but rather view this book as a tool and a resource to guide us in our own decision making.  Ask yourself the same questions that are being asked in the book and you might find your own answers.	2003-02-17

The tweleve winning secrets, as Carville and Begala deem to be, are: 1.) don't quit, 2.) kick [butt], 3.) kiss [butt], 4.) frame the debate, 5.) understand the difference between strategy and tatic, 6.) be open, 7.) know how to communicate, 8.) work your [butt] off, 9.) turn weakness into strength, 10.) be nimble, jack, 11.) know how to recover when you really screw up, and 12.) know what to do when you win.<br />The book gives the lesson of each secret along with stories and examples which exemplify how the secret proved to be successful in their experiences within the War Room.  It is always fascinating to read the real life applications of such strategies and to be inspired by such action.<br />As usual, Carville and Begala write with such flair and style that it is nearly impossible for a reader not to laugh and love the book!<br />My being a loyal follower of Carville and his work, this book certainly is recommended with the highest regard.	2003-02-10

When I picked up this book, I had no idea that I would be so hooked to Wendy Kopp's story, and feel inspired to be a part of Teach For America.<br />This is an incredible book, written by an idealistic woman who envisioned this program while she was an undergraduate at Princeton University.  The book provides valuable insights to those who want to be in the non-profit sector, and especially to those who want to understand the day-to-day operations of how to keep a non-profit organization afloat and alive!<br />Kopp has written a genuine account of how she made her vision a reality, and described the numerous challenges and obstacles Teach For America faced, all the while remaining optimistic.  She and the participants of Teach For America truly exemplify the spirit of restoring quality education to students in our schools.<br />For all those who have participated in the Teach For America program, I salute you!

Brad Koplinski has written an absolutely superb book on the personal experiences of 28 individuals who ran for the Presidency between the years of 1948-2000.<br />This is the kind of book that provides truly rich inside information, regarding candidate's personal feelings and thoughts.  Koplinski begins each chapter with a brief bio of each candidate, as well as a brief overview of the context surrounding the time the candidate was running for office.  Koplinski then goes on to interview the candidate by asking a wide multitude of questions such as &quot;If you had held an elective office when you ran, would it have helped because your name recognition may have been higher or would it have hurt because you wouldn't have had as much time to campaign?&quot; (interview with Reubin Askew); &quot;Did you find it more difficult running as a black or as a woman?&quot; (interview with Shirley Chisholm); &quot;So there was no ill will towards President Johnson when you announced your candidacy against him?&quot; (interview with Eugene McCarthy).<br />The quality of the interviews were excellent and the manner in which the book was written allows for a smooth reading and a profound insight to the process of presidential elections, and how the human side of the candidate partakes in that grueling process.<br />This is a book that will be used as a resource for generations to come - by political campaigns, educators and interested citizens.<br />Highly recommended!!	2001-01-08

I have read countless books on the Kennedys and I've got to say this is, by far, one of the most valuable books I've read.<br />Amanda Smith, who is Joseph P. Kennedy's grandaughter, did a phenomenal job gathering correspondences between Joe Kennedy and family members, dignitaries, colleagues and friends during the years of 1914-1961.  The manner in which Smith compiled the letters allows for a smooth and enjoyable read of the book.<br />I am quite impressed (and thankful!) that Smith meticulously documented and made footnotes of the individuals who were either the recipient or author of a letter or are mentioned in the correspondence - as it provides the reader with a much better understanding of the context of the letter.<br />I've always had a strong appreciation and interest in reading original documents and writings.  Amanda Smith truly did a fantastic job editing the letters and showing a new side of Joe Kennedy which I never saw before.<br />Definately well worth the cost of the book and most certainly recommended with the highest regard for those who enjoy reading about the Kennedys, political science, or correspondences.	2001-01-04

Though the book is clearly partisan, it presents the information in a meticulous way - with quotes and legislative action (or rather, inaction) on W's part, and the source of the information.  It can't get any better than that.<br />Begala writes in a Carville-ish way, which makes the book quite entertaining to read!  After reading the book, I became gravely concerned about W's intentions of becoming President.  Both James Carville and Paul Begala have a natural ability to present information in an informative, entertaining, straight-forward manner - not some beating around the bush, dragging on and on stuff.<br />Simple, right to the point, and factual, this book should be read by all American citizens who are on the fence about who to vote for in this election.	2000-10-09

It is, by far, one of the most intimate chronicles on the  holocaust.  The symbolic choices of characters (mice- jewish, cat- german)  is incredible, as is the unfolding drama of Art's father's experiences  throughout the holocaust.<br />Truth be told, I knew almost nothing about  the holocaust until I read this book.  Suddenly, it dawned on me that our  history books have seriously overlooked this major event in world history.  I have decided, when I become a classroom teacher, that I will use  &quot;Maus&quot; as a required reading for my history courses.  I believe  it will appeal to the students, for several reasons - the main one being  that the book is written/drawn in a comic strip format.<br />I finished the  book in one night.  The minute I started reading it, the author had me  hooked and my interest totally immersed in what would happen throughout the  story.<br />This is an incredible book - one that appeals to all audiences -  and should be made mandatory reading in the school's curriculums.<br />A  fantastic read!	2000-08-30

The book appeals to those who are in their teens, twenties and thirties -  addressing *the* issues that are at heart of our futures.  Major focus on  the government's spending and how it impacts the present and the future,  related to issues such as medicare and social security.  The book is a  wealth of information which Bagby writes in a &quot;down-to-earth, but  sophisticated&quot; manner.  Bagby's writing style is similar to that of  Arianna Huffington's (&quot;How to Overthrow the Government&quot;) -  investigative, presenting facts, and demonstrating how the government  operates.<br />Bagby's message - the fundamental message she is sending to  the reader is to VOTE VOTE VOTE VOTE!!  Make your voices heard by  exercising your right to vote.  Bagby shows what researchers have found  about the Gen X'ers (as she refers to them) - only 1% being apolitical,  with the vast majority being involved in a way that is not so visible.  Meaning, most Americans view the Gen X'ers as apathetic and not getting  involved with the process and the system, whereas research shows this very  same group is actually quite involved - especially in volunteerism and  community service.<br />Most Gen X'ers are watching out for themselves  nowadays and do not have much faith in the notion of the government helping  them when they are ready to retire.  So most Gen X'ers are preparing their  own retirement security by investing in stocks, getting Roth IRA's,  etc....<br />Bagby's book is a very interesting, intellectually stimulating  and inspiring book.  It is not a boring, preaching book, telling Gen X'ers  what they need to do in order to make a difference in our system - quite  the contrary, it inspires us to realize what a challenging task we have at  hand and what the ramifications are if we choose not to be involved by  voting.....<br />A great book!	2000-08-27

The book is a role  model in many respects - one, for writers who want to captivate their  reader's attention, the writing style and means of collaborating nine  different stories into an interesting read; to young girls who aspire to be  leaders of the next generation; to all citizens alike - men, women, of all  races, ethnic groups, and religious backgrounds - this book is an  inspiration of who we should consider as our role models.  These nine women  of the United States Senate have created a new path, one as Robert Frost  poetically wrote that had not yet been taken, and one that serves as an  excellent example for future generations.<br />The book also reflects the  delicate balance of the social pressures of being a public service official  with the humanity of these nine women and their families.<br />&quot;Nine  and counting&quot; is a book all houses, schools, and libraries should have  on their shelves.	2000-08-22

Although it was written long ago, the themes of the novel still have strong applications to the modern society.  The issues are the same: race  relations, family/single parent, education, customs/heritage, culture,  legal system.<br />Harper Lee's masterpiece gracefully tells the story of a  young girl narrating her experiences growing up in the South.  Reading the  narrative allows for us to remember the kid in our own hearts, and the  playfulness and innocence of such a childhood.  Reading the book also puts  a number of pressing social issues right into our faces, and subconsciously  we find that we are influenced by the work of Harper Lee, in this  respect.<br />I have bought this book for many people, and strongly encouraged  them to read it.

He claims we are holding on to the Bobby legacy - something that we created ourselves. How so [bad]. Truly Bobby Kennedy was so much to the American people, and created a vision for our country which stemmed from optimism that change could happen. The reason why this legacy continues is because since the death of Bobby Kennedy, our country has yet to demonstrate the similar caliber of leadership that Bobby brought to the people, the system and to America. While there appear to be accurate assessments of Bobby Kennedy's personality throughout the book, Steel does nothing but drag Kennedy's legacy through the mud - claiming it was all a myth of some sort. Too bad Steel isn't a believer in change, in making America a better place, as Kennedy was. Steel is continuously critical of the fact that Bobby Kennedy was an evolving man, one who grew throughout his career. I, quite frankly, don't see anything wrong with this at all. I perceive it to be a strength, not a weakness, that an individual - even moreso,a politican,a leader -could demonstrate this healthy kind of growth in their efforts to make the world a better place. I think it is Steel who needs to turn on his lights and see the real picture, and not his own myth.	1999-12-20
