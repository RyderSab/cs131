Beautiful illuminations, drawings, icons, full page reproductions and details from medieval and renaissance art fill the 64 pages.<br /><br />The difficulty I have as a Catholic is that I find the text seems to be attempting a forced denominational neutrality. The word Catholic is barely ever used although, arguably, the entire topic of the book should be acknowledged as the domain of the Catholic Church. After all, would Orthodox Christians include St. Bernadette and St. Thomas Aquinas in their book of saints? Would the Anglicans, who also venerate saints, include St. Elizabeth Ann Seton whom many of them shunned after \\"defecting\\" to the Catholic Church? And Protestants would be surprised to hear that St. Raphael is stated to be mentioned in the Bible (p. 51) when he is only mentioned in the Catholic Bible. At the end of the book a calendar of feast days is presented. This is basically from the new Roman Rite of the Mass. So it is a \\"loud silence\\" to me that the book is not more true to a Catholic understanding of the Saints.<br /><br />Here's an example of text which I have great trouble reading to my son, word for word, on page 7: \\"Mary knew about Jesus' ascension into heaven. Many Christians believe that she, too, was taken into heaven.\\" The trouble that I have is that, as a Catholic, I believe that the Assumption of the Virgin Mary is an article of the true faith which must be believed. Catholics with a devotion to Mary might also be irritated that the author states that Mary was \\"frightened\\" when Jesus was arrested. It's just not the way we generally talk about Our Lady.<br /><br />I feel it a bit of a shame to bring these points up because there is also quite a bit of good stuff in here. For example, Mary is listed as the first saint and the article includes all the major events of Mary's life - her betrothal, her \\"fiat\\", the birth of Christ, the miracle at Cana, etc. It contains great lines like \\"Mary loved Jesus with all of her heart\\". Page 6 is a gorgeous icon of the Madonna and child. Whoever designed this did their homework - that's why I say \\"close, but no cigar.\\"<br /><br />Some more examples follow:<br /> --> St. Peter is said to have become the \\"leader of the Christian church.\\" I agree with this statement; however I would add that Roman Catholics believe that St. Peter is the first Pope. The end of the article reads \\"His tomb is said to lie in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome\\". This would seem to be a bit weak to a serious Catholic before 1950, but after the discovery of the tomb in that year the statement is overly questioning.<br /> --> Most good, Catholic saint books explain that the modern \\"Santa Claus\\" is at best a corruption of the fourth century Bishop and Martyr, St. Nicholas. This book exclaims \\"Today he has become the secret visitor who leaves presents for good children.\\" Ugh.<br /> --> St. Thomas the Apostle: \\"He is said to have been a missionary in India...\\" Again - very weakly put. There are Christians in India who trace their spiritual lineage back to St. Thomas.<br /><br />In conclusion I'm going to take a stab in the dark, a wild guess. Suppose someone originally wrote this the way a crotchety old Cat'lic like me would like. Then an editor came by and said \\"Too Catholic\\". So things were edited for ecumenism's sake and this is the result. The other possibility is that a real sincere effort was made to take a Catholic topic but present it as generically as possible, while still maintaining the reverence and respect that non-Catholic Christians generally have for Catholic devotion. I'm sorry I can't give higher marks for Catholics. Again: I sure love those pictures. But because this is a religious book targeted to children during their formative years I'm holding it up to a higher standard.t, the miracle at Cana, etc. It contains great lines like \\"Mary loved Jesus with all of her heart\\".

This collection contains some of his best stories and illustrations. Because it is a large, hardback book, Mayer's drawings are much bigger and easier to appreciate.<br /><br />Of the six stories, \\"Staying Overnight\\" is one of my favorites. Little Critter's friend's family is wealthy and he makes observations about their lifestyle which are very innocent and matter-of-fact, not overly jealous - although he's fairly amazed at the size of his friend's teddy bear.<br /><br />\\"This is my school\\" is another of our favorites, which showcases Little Critter's excitement about school and learning on his first day.	2005-09-11

The focus is not on traditional concepts of bravery and heroism. Neither is it some type of political statement for or against the Vietnam War or wars in general. Rather the characters, being thrown together as a result of the conflict, form relationships which become the primary threads woven into the unfolding drama. The focus, therefore, is a more personal one, that being the spiritual experiences of the protagonists.<br /><br />I found the characters to be quite compelling. Isaiah Ross and Patric Gallo, the two main characters, are developed in contrast to one another. Both are stubborn, opinionated and headstrong, yet they are different in every other way. Ross is calm and collected - a strong silent type who measures words before he speaks. A contented family man with a loyal wife, he's a picture of the dependable military veteran. The sergeant's character, it should be noted, is an archetype rather than a stereotype; he runs a flower shop with his wife in his retirement and is much more thoughtful and contemplative than your run-of-the mill, order-shouting drill-sergeant. Through the course of the story, Ross, an upstanding man with a very practical morality, often thinks back on his childhood religious training at the hands of harsh, Southern \\"fire and brimstone\\" preachers which had ostensibly had made him doubt that he could be an true adherent of any religion.<br /><br />Gallo, on the other hand, is twice-divorced and hops from job to job, city to city, seemingly searching for himself in the civilian world. He blurts out whatever is on his mind, much to the chagrin of Sergeant Ross. The two are mysteriously bound together by a strange incident with a young soldier, Billy Kern, who is presumed dead though his body is never found. The incident, though formally resolved after a tense climax, retains mysterious elements even beyond the pages of the book.<br /><br />McAuliffe uses a tactic of multiple narrators to give a sort of credence to the story much in the same way that Shelley did with Frankenstein. He's also an accomplished wordsmith and he makes the book read easily with blunt, soldier-style realism. Whether he's describing a old, toothless Vietnamese woman \\"gumming a smile\\" or the Lieutenant \\"field-stripping a cigarette\\" the subjects and scenery are brought to life via his vivid descriptions.<br /><br />At times the dialogue between the characters seems somewhat unrealistic. Sergeant Ross softens a bit near the end and Gallo seems to abruptly lose his faith in Kern's survival, the cause which he had eagerly triumphed throughout the book. But all told, the book accomplishes the task of remaining realistic in spite of the incredible nature of what is revealed.<br /><br />I've read only two other books to which I would compare this one, using a war or military setting to make observations and assertions about the spiritual reality of the human experience. One is \\"I Am the Clay\\" by Chaim Potok, the other is \\"Under Pressure\\" by Frank Herbert. If you enjoyed either of those works, as I did, you'll appreciate Purple Sun as well.pages of the book. <br /> <br />McAuliffe uses a tactic of multiple narrators to give a sort of credence to the story much in the same way that Shelley did with Frankenstein.

We tend to believe someone's self-assessment, their claims of achievement, their resumes, etc. We take it all at face-value because we wouldn't make this stuff up, why would anybody - they might get caught!<br /><br />Well, they wouldn't have been caught by me before, but they will now! I bought this audio book to listen to because I was tired of believing people's lies, but I didn't want to become a paranoid employer who didn't trust anyone I hadn't known for 20 years or more. That would lead to missed opportunities with the many honest people in the world. This book helps you to detect lies, but also to make good decisions about what to do when you suspect someone of lying.<br /><br />All based on the psychological study of human nature, this will provide people with great tools to protect themselves from lies and perpetrating liars.<br /><br />Personally, I have noticed that people who don't want me to find out certain things will begin doing a kind of \\"dance\\" which include \\"dance moves\\" which resemble the liars' techniques described in this audio book. This dance analogy represents my somewhat imaginative perception of things, but I include it to illustrate how this book can enlighten the reader and provide a framework for evaluating the truth value of statements and assertion people make. As you may have guessed, I cannot say enough good things about this book.	2005-09-10

Most of them had a whimsical, even zany style which was a break from Dick and Jane and the like.<br /><br />I picked this book up used from somewhere and found it to be an excellent book about the importance or creativity, flexibility and perseverance to achieve one's goals. The characters are vivid, the pictures are hilarious and the dialogue is blunt and to the point, the way kids like it (my kids, at least). The entire book has a rhyming, lyrical quality which is catchy if not addictive. Sometimes I'll be driving down the road with the rest of my family and we'll start reciting it, laughing.	2005-09-08

(then read the stuff by those other guys)	There are a lot of political books out there and a lot of autobiographies. I find this book to be the most intriguing in both categories. Rich in stories of personal and family experience, you'll find yourself on the brink of tears as Medved relates the hardships of his grandparents in the old country and, if you're like me, you'll crack up laughing at his description of the Hippie wanna-be classmates he studied with at Yale who readily conformed to the 60's \\"nonconformist\\" drug culture like it was the latest fad.<br /><br />Michael demonstrates that his early rejection of the ideas of modern liberals like Hilary Clinton and John Kerry were more values-based than politically based. Most of this early rejection had to do with an skeptical attitude toward \\"coastal elitism\\" gained while hitchhiking across the vast, American \\"fly over country\\", or what we now term the \\"red states\\". On these adventures, he met extremely nice, intelligent and knowledgeable truckdrivers and small town folks who challenged the sheltered existence of his uppity classmates.<br /><br />Modern liberals reading this book might scoff that Medved was always a conservative - a common tactical claim made against many who experience a true conversion. But I believe there are things here with which even they will be forced to agree and plenty they can chuckle about, or perhaps at least crack a smile and admit his point. On the other hand, as a conservative who has made his own \\"right turns\\" and as regular listener of Michael's radio show and a sometimes caller, I love the book dearly and laughed raucously at his wit and wisdom from beginning to end. If you like thoughtful books, stuff like Michael Barone's \\"Hard America, Soft America\\" and Allan Bloom's \\"Closing of the American Mind\\" then you will truly appreciate \\"Right Turns\\" more than the standard cookie-cutter, conservative book club fare.	2005-08-12

Supremely suspenseful as always, this book has a creepy feel, reminiscent of the third book. In my opinion, it's tied with Prisoner of Azkaban for my personal favorite. I detest reading spoilers, so I've limited my review to subjects which I hope will whet the appetite and yet not spoil. I, for one, was absolutely surprised by who the Half Blood Prince turned out to be, and I would not deprive anyone of that.<br /><br />The book begins in the office of the Prime Minister of England as he is expecting a visit from the Minister of Magic. The entire country has been ravaged by the return in strength of the armies of the Dark Lord, his death eaters, dementors - whose breeding is blamed for the gloomy mist which has covered the countryside, wherewolves and giants. Fudge explains to the Prime Minister that he is being replaced by the former chief Auror by the wizarding community who wants to see more action against the Death Eaters.<br /><br />The main plot in the book might be summarized \\"How to destroy Voldemort\\", the question which Harry and Albus Dumbledore. Unlike in Order of the Phoenix, Harry and the Headmaster spend a great amount of time together in this book. Most of it involves the examination of memories people have had of the early life of Tom Riddle, the boy who was to become Lord Voldemort, by means of the pensive. This eventually leads to the revelation of the method used by Voldemort to secure a kind of dark immortality. The discussion of dark magic is extremely spooky, but intriguing. Together, Harry and Dumbledore formulate a plan for Voldemort's destruction based on the theory they develop.<br /><br />At least as intriguing is the question of what Draco Malfoy is up to and to what extent Professor Snape is involved. Harry is almost obsessed with this topic, but Ron and Hermione are doubtful that there is anything to Harry's theories, seemingly based on Harry's mistake at the end of the previous school year and their underestimation of Malfoy's abilities.<br /><br />Interwoven with these main plots are many sub-plots which focus on the love interests of the characters, both teenage and otherwise. These aspects are a little bit less awkward than the dating that goes on in the previous 2 books and a little more enjoyable. Ron and Hermione have the fiercest and most extended row yet and prove that Rowling can produce comedy and romance amidst the greatest tragedy of the series.<br /><br />The humor is superb as always; we learn that in order to pass the apparition exam a student must take care not to leave some of his eyebrows behind, and that Luna Lovegood's career as a quidditch commentator will probably remain at the amateur level. Another high point of the book is the funeral for one of Hagrid's magical beasts which, unfortunately for the Order of the Phoenix, is not the only funeral in this volume which ends on a decidedly dark note.d their underestimation of Malfoy's abilities.

After reading Madhaus's review I could only think that he must never have read the Occultic interpretation involving the Ego, Vedic texts, the Chakras, and all that jazz. Or the more practical insistence that the book is an instruction book for sales people in being persistent with reluctant customers. It's a kid's book, OK?<br /><br />My 3-year-old son likes the book and my father-in-law loves reading it to him. In his interpretation, Sam's \\"customer\\" is stubborn and angry almost to the point of violence which seems to keep my son's attention extremely well.<br /><br />Supposedly, this story is the product of a friendly bet between Geisel and Bennett Cerf that he could not write an entire book using only 50 words. True or not, this anecdote is much more interesting to me than some of the constructions of deep, hidden meanings with which our enlightened friends continue to plague and belabor us.	2005-07-15

It's direct, on point and unapologetic. When you read Hannity, you get one side - his. But what I like is that he's not pretending that he's in the middle; he's an admitted and accomplished conservative pundit.<br /><br />He makes his case well in this book. From taxes to national security he makes his case convincingly that the conservatives have the best plan for America and that the liberals are often offering only tired, ineffective slogans, playing race card after race card and doing anything to get back into power at the expense of true progress.<br /><br />The downside in in my mind is that Hannity is somewhat arrogant in his tone. Because of this he can win an argument, but he has trouble winning converts. Don't get me wrong - Sean is a god at what he does and he works like a dog doing TV, radio, books and tours. If you want to read a really interesting book about a conservative conversion, check out \\"Right Turns\\" by Michael Medved.	2005-07-13

This book deals with the bridges God has made with his people, commonly referred to as \\"covenants\\" and our attempts to build bridges through ecumenism.<br /><br />Of great interest to me is the relationship between the covenants with Israel and Judah and the new Christian covenant. This is dealt with in the sections I, II and III of the book. Section I, \\"Israel, the Church, and the World\\" starts off by demonstrating in the story of the Magi that the world has always looked to Israel and Judah for guidance in some degree. It goes on to explain why Jews should not be collectively blamed for Christ's death and how Christ and his contemporaries who were Rabbi's and Jewish officials didn't really have any argument about the Law, the Torah, but rather primarily the argument was about his proclaiming his divine identity.<br /><br />Section II deals with the Christian belief of the uniqueness and fulfilling nature of the \\"New Covenant\\" as compared to the old covenants. He goes into depth looking at the Eucharistic institution accounts, especially those of Mark and Matthew, and comparing these to the covenant institution at Mount Sinai.<br /><br />The third section is my favorite where he deals with the \\"New Manna\\", the Holy Eucharist. In the institution of the Holy Eucharist we find the only mention Christ makes of the word \\"covenant\\", so it is proper that this be included in the book. It was originally a homily; I wished it could have been longer or supplemented by other material.<br /><br />The fourth section is where the former Cardinal is going to lose some people because of some very technical and scholarly language. He discusses the history of ecumenism and affirms the desire to see all Christians re-unified. He discusses the problems with Jewish-Christian dialogue. His concluding point is profound, he states \\"Let me speak plainly: Anyone who expects the dialogue between religions to result in their unification is bound for disappointment.\\" Anyone offended by this might be tempted to say \\"Speak for yourself!\\" and I think he is; primarily he is speaking of the Roman Catholic Church for which he is a representative.<br /><br />Because this book consists of an assemblage of two lectures, an essay and a homily it is not as cohesive a work as \\"God Is Near Us\\", \\"Spirit of the Liturgy\\" or one of my favorites, \\"The Meaning of Christian Brotherhood.\\" One of those might be a better one to start off with if you are just beginning to read works written by the new pope.

It is set in the style of a fairy tale to communicate the great teaching of the Catholic Church regarding the ultimate importance of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass above all earthly things.<br /><br />The story takes place mostly in a bakery shop where the people of the kingdom seem to prefer to spend their time rather than at church, we are told. The shop owner arrogantly argues with an old beggar woman that her offer to hear Mass for him if he were to give her a small piece of bread is of no value. His lack of faith becomes the occasion for a miracle in which a small piece of paper bearing the words \\"One Mass\\" is shown to outweigh all the items in his bakery. These items, representing the natural goods of this earth, are not able to even lower the scale one bit.<br /><br />The response to the miracle is for the people of the kingdom, including the repentant shop owner, to rush out to attend the royal wedding Mass. The king and queen, of which very little is said, can be seen as an analogy of Christ and his Bride, the Holy Church. The desire of both is not so much to have people admire the grandiose royal wedding cake, but to join their hearts in the celebration of the Wedding Mass.<br /><br />This is a very effective book for teaching kids and reminding adults of the surpassing value of the Mass and God's love for us. I was worried that my 3-year son, obsessed with Bob the Builder and the Veggietales would not appreciate the story, but he likes it very much and requests it at bedtime frequently.	2005-07-08

Most of the concrete evidence shows that these skill games only sharpen what I'd call \\"specialist intellect\\" rather than provide some type of well-rounded intellectual development which would come from reading the classics or learning about world history and culture.<br /><br />The idea that somehow playing games is equal to hard work is probably very attractive to the adolescent mind which is found in many adults, unfortunately. The \\"elephant\\" in the living room which Johnson fails to treat is that kids spend arguably too much of their time and energy playing and mastering video games. Even many like myself who do not believe the gross generalization that \\"society is going down the drain\\" have trouble believeing the benefits from playing games for hours on end can equal those from the same amount of time spent on serious study.<br /><br />This book will gather many \\"Amen, brothers\\" from those who are tired of the fire and brimstone preachers prophesying doom on our society. But the lack of substantive research will ensure this book fails to convert the skeptical who have a hard time believing the word \\"smart\\" and the phrase \\"reality show\\" or \\"popular culture\\" belong in the same sentence.	2005-06-10

If you have converted to the Catholic faith from one of the many Protestant traditions, all of which have some \\"beef\\" with the Catholic church, then you are going to go through some pretty intense emotions. What I like about the Hahn's book is how much they stick to the issues, presenting the intellectual reasons why they were both persuaded and how they worked these out, interpreting them and living the Catholic truths in their lives, for example, being open to life in their marriage, making small sacrifices for lent, etc.<br /><br />Reading some of these reviews some may think that the Hahns' conversions weren't grounded in any type of serious reflection but were merely emotional reactions. But a quick check on how many books both Dr. Scott and Kimberly have gone on to write about the faith should clear up that misconception. My advice to anyone who likes \\"Rome Sweet Home\\" is to read \\"The Lamb's Supper\\" next and then \\"Hail Holy Queen\\", both by Scott Hahn.	2005-06-02

When they heard \\"Kyrie eleison\\" (Lord have mercy) they realized that they were at that moment before the Judgment Throne of Christ on the Day of Judgment itself!<br /><br />We in the 21st century need books like this to make the connection between Christ's Ultimate Sacrifice and Our Ultimate Destiny. Dr. Scott Hahn masterfully connects the Book of the Apocalypse and the Divine Liturgy showing in what manner they are two manifestations of the same reality of the Revelation of Jesus Christ, the Son of God and his message of salvation and how they help interpret each other.<br /><br />This is all shown to be in accordance with the way the fathers and teachers of the Catholic Church have always viewed the Mass. I would recommend this book for non-Catholics who are curious as to why the Catholic church does not make a lot of hay out of \\"end-time prophecies\\" for our own time from Revelation; we see it as signifying something much deeper and eternal.	2005-05-28

Rowling proves to us that the success of the first book was no fluke by giving HP fans another dose of adventure. There's a new mystery this time, new characters and a new attempt by Voldemort to return.<br /><br />We see more revelation in this book about the different characters of the four houses at Hogwart's School, most notably the contrast between Gryffindor and Slytherin. The motives and conflicts of the founders are explained as being behind the present day struggles. The \\"pure-blood\\" prejudice becomes more of a major theme and becomes a defining issue between good and bad wizards.<br /><br />Getting to see more of the Weasley family is a special treat in Book II. Arthur's love of muggles and fascination with \\"muggle artifacts\\" is humorous and provides insights into a humble attitude toward magical gifts which characterizes the good wizards. The growing relationship between Ron and Hermione continues to spawn great dialogue. Mrs. Weasley continues to endear herself as the good mother who is a bit over-bearing at times and the twins continue to be dedicated to the type of mayhem which is all in good fun.	2005-05-25

S. Lewis's work. Rowling's Harry Potter series rates high marks in this regard.<br /><br />I began reading once the first 3 books were in print so it's impossible for me to look at the book purely by itself. Everyone knows the basic story: Harry Potter finds out he is a wizard at age 11, that his deceased parents were also wizards. He is sent for by the famous Wizarding school, Hogwarts, where he begins to learn how to use magic and learn about the magical world, full of good wizards, bad wizards, goblins, spells and all sorts of magical creatures and objects.<br /><br />What distinguishes a good wizards from a \\"dark\\" one? One thing to remember is that Rowling's original title is \\"The Philosopher's Stone\\" which should provide an enormous clue to the author's approach to magic and morality. The one historical character mentioned in the book, Nicholas Flamel, was a Christian Alchemist who alegedly produced the philosopher's stone and used the subsequent proceeds in gold for benevolent ends, e.g., giving money to the poor, etc. Putting Headmaster Albus Dumbledore in league with Flamel is a direct reference to Alchemy which has historically been seen as a neutral study which can be used for good or evil (Sir Isaac Newton was purportedly a \\"dark alchemist\\".)<br /><br />One thing fantasy readers might appreciate about Harry Potter over the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy is the amount of mystery involved in the destinies of the characters; we're always finding characters who might be bad or good or who were good and went bad - the moral development is more dynamic and in process as we see them making good and not so good choices.	2005-05-19

This book made me first hit myself then start saving my pennies to go to Rome a third time \\"videre Petrum\\" - to see St. Peter and check out the man's remains for real this time. A few chapters later, Weigel persuaded me that I also must travel to the Holy Land if to do nothing else but visit the place where our Lord rose from the dead and the Easter mass is celebrated every Sunday.<br /><br />The power of persuasion in this my now favorite of George Weigel's books lies in his development of the theme of the \\"grittiness\\" of Catholicism. The ability to touch, smell, feel, see and taste the relics of our faith which are both bound in time and space and beyond them add a crucial dimension to faith which makes faith more than intellectual assent to certain definitions.<br /><br />Certainly this is no innovation, just a good and sound development upon the theology of the Incarnation of Christ as laid out in St. John's prologue. I believe a firm grasp of this truth will deepen any Catholic's faith and hopefully serve to bring the ideologues on the far left and the far right back to the cross where they can make some real spiritual progress - maybe for the first time in their lives. I would recommend this book for anyone even if he hadn't quoted Flannery O'Connor which always wins an auotmatic recommendation from me.	2005-05-18

It is not a theological or apologetic sourcebook; although it is explanatory in nature it's much more devotional and can be used effectively in one's prayer and meditation. Even so, many scripture verses are provided, references to the fathers and the councils are also to be found in large number.<br /><br />Maybe I like this book so much because Dr. Hahn seems to agree with me that Marian devotion and Marian theology cannot be separated. You have to know a woman to love her (theology), you have to love a woman to want to know her better (devotion). Knowledge of Mary is theological in nature because of her close relation to God the blessed Trinity. This relation is one of deep love - Bishop Sheen named his popular book on Mary \\"The world's first Love\\" - so don't expect a thorough treatment of Our Lady from a \\"purely theological\\" viewpoint.<br /><br />Dr. Hahn includes his own very humbling experiences in this book to demonstrate how the Lord whom he had served as a Protestant was literally dying to introduce him to his mother: \\"Behold thy Mother.\\" This book makes a great gift, especially for those ignorant OR truly curious about the Church and it's teachings about Mary.	2005-05-16

Our Debt to the Catholic Church	Books	5	27	32	N	N	Great reference book, corrects many erroneous opinions	When I was converting to Catholicism I found this book to be a very concise reference book to explain the Catholic view of the scriptures and to provide substantive and historical arguments for this view. As an example, the idea of the ealry Roman Catholic church \\"keeping everything in Latin\\" to prevent common folk reading the scriptures is deftly and dismissively dealt with (all literate people read Latin at the time) along with other issues and objections both simple and complex.<br /><br />As another reviewer pointed out, the only real weakness of the book is that it is not well footnoted with sources for the material. Some might not like the manner in which arguments are presented which is often brusque and matter-of-fact; the book does not pull any punches and I actually appreciate it for that reason. It presents the \\"ascending spiral\\" theory of the canon very well and demonstrates the belief that you cannot have the Bible without the Church and vice versa.	2005-05-10

My three-year-old is captivated by the pictures on each page which include very reverent photographic images, colorful icons and \\"cartoon pictures\\" of a guardian angel explaining different parts of the Mass to a little boy.

Thus begins this unforgettable story of a pre-born baby's life from consciousness through birth. This book is a masterpiece which has a profound effect on both children and adults. Although many non-religious people might dismiss it as fanciful, the idea of a small helpless pre-born baby speaking to an angel is a sensible and comforting belief. A book like this could tend to be sappy or sentimental, but instead the story is very simple and honest.<br /><br />The entire narration is from the child's point of view. This has an absolutely disarming effect. Reading the words of the book will almost assuredly make many parents cry, especially those with small children, so you might want to read this through a few times before reading it to your child.<br /><br />There is a part where the angel explains that beyond the \\"outside world\\" there is an \\"even bigger world\\" that the angel will lead the child into someday. That reminded me of the poem of St. Francis which says \\"Dying we are born to eternal life.\\"	2005-03-16

The other 75% the same old defense of liberalism by using favorite Bible verses and biased interpretations of the same. (This can be done by right-wingers as well using their favorite verses, of course, and it often is.) His false or unproven premises outside the sphere of religion are one of the things that kill his arguments, e.g., the supposed mistreatment of war prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and the supposed military support of Saddam's army which turns out to be 1% of his arms (he got the other 99% from the former Soviet Union.)<br /><br />Another interesting thing to note is that most people who make arguments from the way in which the \\"early Christians\\" lived (33-300 AD) usually pick and choose what they like. The early Christians believed in strict penances for sin, some of them even believing that a Christian could only be forgiven once for a given sin. They also believed celibacy was a higher state than married life, abortion was a grave moral evil and that the Bishop of Rome was infallible when he spoke on faith and morals.<br /><br />I realize that these do not directly touch the subject of this book, but Martos takes the \\"puritan\\" approach by insinuating that development of the just war doctrine was purely pragmatic and we need to take the supposed pacifism of the early Christians to heart yet not their devout Roman Catholicism.	2004-09-08

Lewis surrounded himself with Catholics at Oxford, immersed himself in literature written by Catholics and accepted Catholic teachings that Protestants are not supposed to (like the doctrine of purgatory). So many have wondered why he never converted to Catholic Christianity as did many of his peers. To point to his &quot;Ulster Protestant prejudice&quot; is a natural, but somewhat overly-simplistic, explanation when applied to this remarkable former atheist turned premier Christian apologist. This well-researched and insightful book shows both the points of convergence and divergence between Lewis's brand of Christianity and Catholic doctrine and seeks to unravel the reasons why Lewis never went the way of Newman and Chesterton. Speculative at times but always cogent in his arguments, the Catholic author always deals with C.S. Lewis and his &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; with great respect, demonstrating his vast knowledge of the circumstances Lewis's life and great familiarity with his writings.	2003-12-09

I finally decided to read the book. It's great, well worth reading to get more at the motives, but I was disappointed because some of my favorite scenes were \\"missing\\" (rather the movie added them.) Maybe I would have been mad at the movie if I'd read the book first.<br />I feel like Chili Palmer myself, having watched the movie first and having liked it better. But here's my review: The characters in this story are great. Chili - the too-cool-for-anyone-but-nice-guy ex-mobster, Leo - the pathetic loser dry-cleaner, Karen - the hot, smart, cynical actress, Bo Catlett - the mean, delusional, drug-dealing Hollywood-player-wanna-be. You have no idea what is going to happen next in Leonard's books and the characters really become alive as a result.<br />The book can help bug fans of the movie get more out of the \\"visual fabric\\" of the story. The interactions between Chili and Bo are more developed in the book than the movie, which I appreciated, as well as more insights and discussions about what the movie \\"Mr. Lovejoy\\" is actually about. The meeting between Nikki and Chili is hilarious in the book. And the book focuses on Karen's personality more. My advice is to read it and see it.	2002-11-11

After reading it, my opinion is unchanged. So my original review based on my impression follows. I strongly suggest anybody interested in the Ezzo's methods research the pros AND cons.<br /><br />My sister and brother-in-law abide by this book to the letter. I was able to observe them at my parents for 4 or 5 days. Their first child, a girl, seems fairly normal at 3 years except she is a little manipulative. But their second child, a boy about a year-and-a-half old has a really strange, detached disposition for a little kid. He cries a lot and they ignore him, I imagine in keeping with the Ezzo method which encourages this. They have an unspoken attitude that their own convenience comes first and then the needs of their kids. They act as if their children are \\"learning\\" the schedule but I believe that what is happening is really more like the conditioning that you study in Psych 101, e.g., Pavlov's dog.<br /><br />I have read articles which condemn this method written by credible health experts and I advise everyone to study both sides. In summary I have this to say: 1) Not all children respond to this in the same way. 2) The premise of this method is that your needs come first, your children's second.<br /><br />Also, check out this site for information before following the advice in this book: [...]<br /><br />Update, 3/25/2005: It's now about 3 years since I wrote this review. The boy has minor but chronic health problems, ear infections, neck and back stiffness, etc. He's also kind of small for his age. The parents have abandoned some of the advice of the authors about early reduction of feedings based on the belief that the Ezzo's were wrong about that specifically. They still trust the Ezzo's in general, but they've had 2 other sons who don't share the symptoms of their first son.	2002-04-23

First, Dr. Hahn produces the greatest number of connections I've ever heard between the Old Testament, the apocalyptic passages in the synoptic Gospels and St. John's Apocalypse providing maximum insight to what the early Christians, who were Jewish converts, would have heard in the visions. He proceeds to tie these insights into the events directly experienced by the early Church in the 1st century, culminating in the destruction and fall of Jerusalem in 70 A.D.<br />Secondly, he presents these explanations in a very rich, exciting way which is eminently practical for the lay Christian, the clergy-man or the Theologian. He cites sources regularly for the listener who wishes to dig deeper.<br />Lastly, it is the most even-handed treatment of interpretive views which are not his own. His counter-arguments to other interpretations cite biblical, historical and empirical evidence, not merely denominational or political opinions. For example, he never condemns the Futurist view, believing it to have merit as the other views. However, he gives examples of how often in the past the those who have applied specific prophecies to world events have been proven wrong. Well worth the investment in time and cost; everyone should take away something regardless of interpretive prejudices at the start.	2001-11-01
