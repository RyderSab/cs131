Like many of the stories about the period, it is depressing.  Well, so was living in Ireland then.  Sure, no potatoe famine yet, but war is just as deadly.<br />An interesting story of Donal O Sullivan, one of the men who falls often into the shadow of the other big fellas of the times, Hugh O Neill.<br />Following the Battle of Kinsale (i.e., slaughter, massacre, etc.), the lord of the land, The O Sullivan, decides to lead his people away from the ravaged land northward to the bastion of the remaining &quot;irish&quot;, ironically, to the modern mind, in Ulster.  In the dead of winter, an unusually hard one, with little food and mostly desperation, how do you lead your people to the tentative safety far away?  This paints a vividly bitter picture of the devastation wrought upon the Irish poor by the English army and Foreign Policy.<br />This is an intense story, if a bit thin on character development and plot.  Survival is a plot, even if it doesn't move quickly.  Survival was the goal - physical survival.  But, physical survival was always seen by the lords as concurrent with survival of what was &quot;Irish&quot;.  That seems the bitter truth - in the effort to simply survive, much of what we once treasured is lost to the ravages of time and expediency.<br />Perhaps with the looming shadow of war today, we could read through this and take another look at the geography of the world today - and ask ourselves whether our government is just allied with the English, or acting like their forefathers.	2003-02-18

No, he just complains.  It gets so boring hearing people criticise the Church (whether justly or no), who never expend the effort to<br />think of something to DO to correct the situation.  There is no generosity contained within these covers.<br />Scathing & bitter, yes.  Well written, no.  After 150 pages of Day's disjointed tirades, I simply gave up.  I gave it one star simply because the comparison between what Day perceives as the current music situation and Bauhaus architechture was actually interesting and rather unique.  Otherwise, it would have gotten 0.<br />I must be truly blessed to have spent 37 years as a Catholic across the US and Europe, and only once attended Mass at a church which even vaguely resembled this depiction.<br />Why spend $17?  Pick it up at a book store and read the last 2 and a half pages - the only part of the book truly worth reading:  a 10 point guide to a good music ministry.  (The only concise, well written part of the book, which is concurrently the only part I would endorse.)<br />Day's writing is internally inconsistent, disorganized and occasionally down right offensive.<br />As a Catholic music minister at a parish which subscribes to all 10 of Day's points about good music ministry, I was bored to tears.  I was also struck by the fact that he spent 150+ pages criticising Taste, *not* theological content.  Who actually believes that Taste can be regimented?<br />While repeatedly extolling Germany and Austria as shining examples of Catholic music heritage (as if every single piece of music written there was the equal of Bach or Mozart), he provides a scattered, disjointed argument (I think it was an argument) over 30 or 40 pages about \\"ethnic\\" Catholics in the US and their great music at Masses, but the high mass is awful, or maybe it was the low mass with their great \\"ethnic\\" enthuiasm in their folk music ... but folk music is bad, if it's American folk music ...???<br />Having attended Mass in both Germany and Austria, I can vouch that not every church there plays Mozart/Bach on Sundays.  And, when I was in Vienna listening to the Vienna Boy's Choir at Easter Sunday Mass, not everyone was singing ...<br />Suffice to say that Day's prime book he recommends (Gather III) contains not just one, but all of the music about which Day<br />complains.  Why?  Because the hymnal also contains all the music Day praises - it is well balanced.<br />We are not Catholic because our tastes are Universal - it would be a very boring Church, if that were so.<br />This book is written for people who already share the author's opinion.  Preaching to the converted is not something for which<br />we should strive.  This book will assuredly offend the \\"stunted Divas screeching in microphones\\" and \\"folky\\" liturgical directors, driving them away from any persuasive argument which Day might have offered.  Of course, since he doesn't offer any, the fact that he's offensive to those he ridicules is probably moot.reat \\"ethnic\\" enthuiasm in their folk music ... but folk music is bad, if it's American folk music ...???<br />Having attended Mass in both Germany and Austria, I can vouch that not every church there plays Mozart/Bach on Sundays.

Each character displayed, pinned to a board as one might an insect collection:  to be completely examined and scrutinized for flaws, defects, and identifying characteristics.  Perhaps most appealing is not being innundated with detail at the beginning.  We find the strings along with Alan Turner, secrutiy expert, wondering where they will lead us.  A missing man, Leo Harting, Harting Leo, a German war refugee who returned to his Fatherland, is also a mystery man:  spy, patriot, or simply a nobody?  Nobody seems to know the same version of the man.<br />A skillful display of the politics and social up-heaval in early 60s Germany as a mighty nation struggled to determine its own future once again.  Le Carr&egrave;'s experience working in the very same Embassy in the early 60s no doubt provides the truly realistic vision he paints so skillfully with words.  The entire profession of diplomacy is not painted in a particularly flattering light - the supremecy of the nebulous national goals reigns over the reality of the individual's life.<br />As a first taste of his writing, I am eagerly looking forward to more.	2002-10-28

Markham's little band of not-so-merry men.  Neither fish nor fowl (perhaps like the marines portrayed as neither soldiers nor sailors), this doesn't come across as a wind in your hair nautical adventure (since it pretty much all occurs on land), nor is it a soldier's tale.<br />It was interesting, and while certain combinations of characters are expected (the Gaelic NCO who must be persuaded to the reluctant support of the officer who is thrust without realization into his new role), they aren't completely re-hashed personalities.<br />While Markham doesn't appear to be cut from the same cloth as the rest of the men of the late 18th Century, in his opinions and actions, he and his companions were drawn well.  Many hints of intrigue or seeds for curiosity to draw you to the man (who served in the British army in the Revolutionary War, then the czarist army in Russia, and now is back in the British army and foist onto the RN).  Will his purported cowardice, previous love interests, etc. come back to haunt him in further adventures?<br />Worth reading.  Not entirely sure it's worth pursuing into vol. 2, which the author's postscript indicated was coming.  Obviously the first of a series.	2002-09-27

Llywelyn brings medieval Ireland to the glory of the modern English language.  Taking characters of the Irish sagas, she creates a fleshed-out cast of characters. If you've read Brian Boru's tales before, you'll find this is true to the basic plot.  The story is told of all too human men and women thrust into the heroic situation.  This was written as if it were a biography of the great hero.  Like many of her novels, she paints her hero as a man, first, and a hero second.<br />Set in roughly the 9th Century, the Danes were settling in Ireland on the east coast;  they built cities and were forming settlements.  Not all of the Irish kings were happy about this.  The Danes put a new skew to the Irish vs. Irish fighting, making it the Irish &amp; the Danes vs. the Danes &amp; the Irish.  Brian is called to make more of himself, and eventually tries to gather the Irish to his banner and subdue/evict the Danes.  Both sides are out to stop him, for various reasons.<br />The action will keep you on your seat edge, as will the politicial intrigue going on behind the action.<br />If you like this, definately find Llyewlyn's other earlier heroic works.	2002-09-27

This is the sort of book which has SO much stuff, you will never use it all - but it will (almost) always be able to help you.<br />This is the one reference book I was willing to pay for out of pocket, whether or not my employer paid for it.<br />I found a 1927 copy of this at a used book store a few years ago ... - I still have it, and believe it or not, I do use it. It's got really neat stuff the modern editions don't. Which is why you shouldn't hesitate to drop [money] for one today.

Read both!<br />The Apocalypse:  so many treatises have been written, from John of Patmos to \\"Left Behind\\".  None quite get around to addressing the apocalyptic impact on the rest of the universe:  So what's an Angel to do, after It is All Over?  Really, when it's all said and done, it's just bad for business, this End of the World.<br />There aren't quite any heroes, as we follow the tale of an angel and demon, who have developed quite a good working relationship since that whole Eden scandal.  Both are stunned to realize that everything they enjoy here on Earth (bookstores, Bentleys) is about to come to a screeching halt in 11 years, when the Anti-Christ comes into his Power.  So, they wait at the birthday party when the Hell-hound is due to arrive as a sort of present from the powers below.  And the dog doesn't arrive.  Um ... if this isn't the Antichrist ... ?<br />Overwhelming wit and satire.  And things that one (at least this one) doesn't often contemplate:  so what do demons discuss at their regular staff meetings?<br />A completely light-hearted look at the End of the World As We Know It.  Or is it light-hearted?<br />Through the demon's part of the story, the authors have modernized the picture of evil.  Crawley, the demon, shakes his head and is constantly annoyed at the 14th century minds of demons who think lacivious thoughts are the fulcrum of mortal temptation to sin.  Crawley is a modern chap:  he ties up the entire London phone system for 45 minutes at lunch and just watches the horrors perpetrated by man upon his fellow man spread out like ripples on a pond.<br />Like the advice of Screwtape to his nephew, damnation is just handing the humans enough rope.  They'll do all the hard work for you.<br />While Good Omens is almost incessantly funny, do not let the humor distract you from a vital point:  if we cling to old ideas of the Apocalypse, we'll never see It coming.e, we'll never see It coming.	2002-06-18

Starting with Roman graffiti and ending with modern calligraphy revival schools in California to 8th Century Burma, there's a little bit of everything here.<br />A nice review of western european medieval calligraphy, I rarely use the rest of the book.  It presents well how the different styles are related, the development of modern styles of calligraphy and type fonts, the 20th century revival of more traditional art forms with some froo-froo hat tipping to Victorian style copperplate to bold modern blocky forms.<br />This has it all.  A well written book, it references the copious plates and examlpes while guiding the novice through the years and development of the manifaceted art style known as calligraphy.<br />I would recommend this for intermediate students who are interested in the history of calligraphy, to complement learning how to do it.  This will not teach you how to do calligraphy, it will hopefully teach you how to appreciate it as an art form.	2002-04-23

Very interesting to read the various characters' views.<br />Very long, very detailed book about Colonial life in North Carolina.  This is *not* the gripping, turn-the-page-what's-happening-next of the first book.  Not inherently bad - but you might be in for a surprise if you were expecting more of the same from the first 4 books.<br />Still leaves us wondering what's going to happen to everyone involved.  Unfortunately, it also left me wondering whether or not the next book will be as monumentally huge.  I'm more interested in the direct Clare/Jamie/Fraser story, less about day-to-day life in the Colonies.  Yes, I want the historical details to make the Fraser story believable, but I don't want to read another book that has Fraser stuff thrown in to make the Colonial history good.<br />Too much repetative &quot;development&quot; of the major characters (Clare, Jamie, Brianna, Roger).  But, again Gabaldon shines with her depiction of the many, many other people in the story.  They usually all seem distinct and different and interesting (if not &quot;good&quot;).<br />Definately don't buy in hard back.	2002-04-15

What bizzare and seemingly unrelated event is now going to become critical to the history of this book?<br />An interesting discussion is presented about the OED and dictionaries in general:  why the OED is \\"different\\", what existed before it, etc.  Best of all, at the end of the book was an advert for the OED and a call for volunteers to help with the continued development of it!  Delightful conclusion.<br />The only two reasons I didn't give it 5 stars:<br />Difficulty being able to identify where the author was using artistic license to portray events in a more \\"complete picture\\" and where he was actually citing from verifiable sources.  If the latter doesn't matter to you, please feel free to revel in a well told story.<br />The only complaint was that the chronology of the story wasn't linear - it jumped back and forth in a rather unsetting manner which slightly distracted from the smooth flow of the account.	2002-04-15

Cazaril, Our Hero, is going to ask to be a menial servant, in hopes of finding peace and quiet after a long, hard career as a soldier and now escaped galley slave.  No Hero in Bujold's worlds ever manages to quite achieve peace, much less quiet ...<br />Thrust into the role of royal tutor rather than scullery help, he is equally placed in the midst of treachery, plotting, conniving, and byzantine madness.  Duty, an omnipresent theme in Bujold's work, is stretched:  duty to personal honor, duty to employer, duty to the gods... who gets first dibs?<br />Our Hero continues to swim the blind treacherous seas with almost non-stop action packed adventure.  Good versus Evil:  who wins, and is winning quite so obvious?<br />Bujold manages to introduce with style, flair and tact what few manage in Fantasy (and most avoid in SF): theology and religion.  They are not the forefront of the book, but they are a significant pillar upon which the plot is built.  She manages the role of religion in society, and theology in religion without making it a cooky-cutter copy of something already existing or being pedantic.<br />For die-hard Vorkosigan-saga fans, this is written with less evident humor, but equal style and panache.	2002-01-03

I find this difficult to recommend to anyone under the age of 30 whose native language is not American English.  Ellroy writes as if he were in the 1950s: this is not any story which could be put in 1950 as easily as 2050.  This story is the 1950s.  The style and the content are beautifully anachronistic.<br />The plot is intricate and convoluted.  You tell yourself:  this must all be connected... musn't it?<br />Murder and mayhem clutch again at the heart of the City of Angels:  labor unions, Communists and Hollywood.<br />Young aspiring LA County detective Upshaw, who thrives on the newly emerging science of forensics, is the only person interested in investigating a bizzare murder.  DA Elis Lowe, is capitalizing on persecuting Communism in order to win greater political power.  LAPD Lt Considine signs on to the quest for Commies to win public acclaim to try to gain custody of his son.  LAPD Lt. Smith is out for number one.<br />Omnipresent in the background is the union dissent, movie making, mob violence, drug trafficking, and violence.<br />James Ellroy's writing is so potently real, it will leave you realizing why such cotton-candy fluff as &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; was so popular 50 years ago, as a necessary escape from the reality surrounding LA and Hollywood.	2001-08-23

Leary Commanding.  It is now residing in the box heading towards my local used book store.  I was still interested enough to finsh the book to see if it ended the way I thought it would (it did, no big surprises).<br />Drake continually interrupts his writing to explain the motives of the characters - as if I wasn't paying attention or too dim to pick it up myself.  (I am not speaking of filling in the gaps for those who hadn't read the previous book, which were expected.)  Stylistically, this really disrupts the flow of reading.  Drake can write well and can write good action.  I was disappointed to see the quality of his work disrupted.<br />The overall story line was interesting.  There was a more than satisfactory amount of action, political and military.  I enjoyed the brief descriptions of the various crew members.  They weren't detailed, not being major characters, but they were at least interesting and varigated.  Occasionally to the point that I wonder if the author's acquaintences could put names to them...<br />However, the two main characters (Lt. Leary and PO Mundy) are flat.  Very nicely painted, with much potential, but still flat.  Am I really expected to believe that a physically bumbling and aristocratically arrogant communications officer who knows nothing about, and apparently has made no effort to gain knowledge of, the Navy in which she serves, is supposed to be a welcome crew member?  The rest of the crew is a collection of crack, top-notch sailors, but not her?<br />The book reminds me of some civilians' over-done portrait of the military:  accept the structure presented and don't wonder why it's done that way.<br />Perhaps it is not the characters, but their motivations which are flat.  How many times can Adele Mundy be offended because someone adddressed &quot;A Mundy of Chatsworth&quot; in that manner?  How many times will we read Lt. Leary thinking that &quot;A Leary of Bantry&quot;....??<br />If you want an aristocratic tradition painted into your far-flung futuristic space faring navy, avoid this book and head for another David:  David Weber.quot;A Leary of Bantry&quot;....??  <br />If you want an aristocratic tradition painted into your far-flung futuristic space faring navy, avoid this book and head for another David:  David Weber.	2001-06-11

This isn't only funny, I was laughing aloud while reading it.  This really shows off Ludlum's ability to lead you along a primrose path, only to find you're not really seeing what you thought you were.<br />A law student receives a letter from the U.S. Supreme Court.  Surprising, since he didn't write to them.  They have decided to hear his case involving a breach of contract between the U.S. Government and an Indian tribe.  [apparently, there is a small provision for cases being heard directly to the supreme court without previous judicial consideration]<br />The only catch is - the law student has no idea what they're talking about.  Suddenly the CIA, the FBI, the Department of Defense, and the mafia are all after him.<br />The legal case revolves around the fact that, under U.S. law, any improvements made to real estate which is illegally seized revert to the lawful owner when the real estate is returned.  So, if I steal your farm, spend thousands of dollars improving it, and then you get the property back, I can't ask for restitution or the money back.

The portrayal of the second messiah, God, Jesus Christ, Satan, etc. are quite thought-provoking.<br />This should sincerely make you think about your pre-conceived notions of what heaven/hell &amp; God's relationship with man is all about.

The violence is ripped from the front page of papers (although, in this case, from the front page of 1947).<br />A gruesome murder is the centerpiece for this novel, as a police officer desperately seeking to be a detective cannot cease his obsession with the case.  It overwhelms his life and his career without overwhelming the plot or flow of action.<br />There's an interesting look (in passing) at some aftermath of WWII, and the impact of being German-American or having been friends with Japanese-Americans.<br />The end, when it hits you, will be a left hook worthy of Joe Lewis.	2000-12-29

US	52683755	R1MIN2LWQKDAT2	0385492510	409245980	Gates of Fire	Books	5	3	5	N	Y	Best book I read in 1999	Riveting.  Engrossing.  Detailed.  Sympathetic.  Immediate.  Not being one of the great authors of history, words elude me to accurately describe the impact this had.<br />Gates of Fire brings you immediacy:  right there, in the dust and dirt of the lyceum, in the sweating struggling surge of the line of battle, in the struggle of a young man to chart his course in life despite the fates and forces of man and nature.<br />If Pressfield doesn't know how to use a sword or kill a man with one, it certainly isn't noticable in his writing.<br />Told from the unique point of view of a survivor of the Battle of Thermopylae, this is the epic of a Spartan slave.  Bereft of his home at a young age, Xeones knows that a man without a city is not a man.  He looks at Hellenistic Greece as a cornucopia from which to choose.  Sparta draws him like a siren's song.  He wants to be a warrior, so he heads off to the home of the greatest in Hellas.<br />But life never goes the way you want.<br />Gates of Fire follow his training and beginning as a warrior.  Though not a free man, he trains side by side with them, and is eventually confronted with the fact that even a warrior's life is never as simple as it seems in the training grounds.  The book ends with the Battle of Thermopylae.<br />Do you know how the battle ended?  Read the book anyway.  For, like war, it is not always who won or lost, but how it all came to be which is how one learns.  I actually cried at the end, even though I knew how the story had to end.<br />(I also heard the audio-book.  It is condensed, but very worthwhile.)<br />Be prepared to exert yourself when you read this.  It will draw you in, and is not a quick read.  Definately the best book I read in 1999.	2000-12-28
US	52683755	R1XPHFO7RIGVA6	0842329129	46316172	Left Behind: A Novel of the Earth's Last Days (Left Behind No. 1)	Books	2	4	7	N	Y	Overly simplistic revelation	Intriguing premise (assuming the Book of Revelation is to be taken literally).  Good start.  Obviously supposed to have a sequel, so I didn't like the end.<br />Written for high- or middle-school reading levels.  This is not &quot;high literature&quot; that requires a college education or repeated reading to understand.<br />It is an interesting look at a literal interpretation of parts of the Book of Revelations (a prophesy of the end of the world as we know it as a precursor to the second coming of the Messiah).<br />The characters are not well-developed but do hint at being interesting (again, this is the first installment of a series, it might get better in the next volume).  The plot is fairly obvious.<br />This is light-reading.  Content acceptable for adolescent or older.<br />I can't say I completely agree with the content on a religious level.  How the authors paint armageddon is pretty sterotypic to the more evagelical Protestant groups who subscribe to a literal reading of the Bible.<br />I do applaud the obvious effort to get people to think about and consider their beliefs, and the potential long-term consequences of both belief and action.	2000-12-28
US	52683755	R18ZKXG0PN4V03	044022425X	173145556	The Drums of Autumn	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Back to the Best	Drums of Autumn will leave you breathless.  Whether from the pounding of the titular drums as war rises again on the horizon, or from the tension of suspense, you'll close the last page completely satisfied and wondering why you're exhausted.<br />Our Heroine, Clare, finds herself looking for her past, in more ways than one.  Returning to the 18th Century, she decides that trying to find the love of her life is more important than staying safe and secure in the 1960s.<br />Unfortunately, like daughter, like mother.  Her only child follows her on an expedition to find Jamie, Clare's husband and Bree's father.<br />The action continues in Scotland and migrates to the New World.<br />After having been separated for neigh unto 20 years, both Clare and Jamie have continued their lives, separately.  It is the detailed, sympathetic portrait of them attempting to reconcile their shared past with their current present which will pull at your heartstrings.  They are realistic, which certainly means it isn't the same old thing you've read before.<br />Gabaldon never ceases to amaze with her insight into the workings between men and women, without denigrating either one in the process.<br />This kept me on the edge of my seat, eagerly turning pages like few other books.<br />If you've read Outlander, either stop, or simply buy the next three together.  Dragonfly in Amber and Voyager are definately worthwhile, if for no other reason then to get you to Drums of Autumn.  This and Outlander are her best so far.	2000-12-28

This masterpiece of 1950's noir blows away the stereotypic &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot; image of America and ignores the glitter of Tinseltown, leaving bare the violent reality of society's police force left in the gulch between the law and the law enforcement.<br />A gruesome murder, stolen heroin, a depraved rape tarnish the self-righteous epithet of the City of Angels.  The investigations interweave, as the characters grow on you.<br />The characters are intimately painted in detail, without being heavy or overdone.  Elroy has an amazing grasp of how to paint the ordinary man.<br />The use of language is utterly delightful, with a consistant effort to read like the American English of the 50's.<br />The book is long and heavy.  This is not light summer reading fare or 'brain-candy' for an afternoon.  But, if you want a spectacular American novel, this is it.<br />Movie comparison:  well, seeing the movie certainly won't spoil the book.  The basic plot is the same, but the action is different.  After seeing the film, I sought out the book.  After reading the book, I was even more impressed with how true to the flavor (though not the details) of the film.  The character's relationships in the movie aren't the same as the film - obviously trying to keep the movie under 7 hours.  If you liked it, go get the book.	2000-12-19

Marryat displays his colors in his usual fashion:  &quot;normal&quot; people, real characters, and the tang of salt air in your nostrils as you read.<br />The unacknowledged son of a post captain, young Percival strives to do his duty to achieve his father's/captain's respect.  Adventures ensue.<br />Easy to read.  Less social critique than Mr. Midshipman Easy.  Less gruesome reality than The Privateersman.  Not his best, but it is still a good yarn!	2000-12-18

I found this a delightful observation of society, which from today is even more humorous than it might have been 200 years ago.<br />The language isn't far off from today's (the sailing vocabulary hasn't -obviously- changed).  A good read for just about any age.  Footnotes (in the Heart of Oak edition) to help those unfamiliar with some 19th C. idioms or semi-obscure sailing terminology.<br />If you haven't read Marryat's work yet, this is a good one to get your feet wet.	2000-12-15
US	52683755	R39LCBGB36Q83H	0440212561	983256815	Outlander	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Ignore the fact this is marketed in the &quot;romance&quot; section	Utterly mesmerizing - the saga of a WWII nurse thrown back in time to what appears to be the pre-Culloden Scotland Highlands.  Knowing what she does of history, what is a compassionate Englishwoman to do?<br />Engulfed with the sweeping panorama painted by Gabaldon, you will find yourself cheering for the characters.  Clare, the heroine, is down-to-earth, but doesn't really believe this 18th century stuff is all real.  Jamie, the hero, is painted to be the man most women would want without being artificial (a remarkable feat!).<br />All of the cast of characters are well developed.  The pace varies from sedate to heart-thumpingly fast.  The history and representation of Scottish/English relations appear fairly accurate to a moderatly-well-informed critic.<br />Outlander has a unique conclusion (for a 'romance' novel).  This book stands by itself.  You don't need to read the other Gabaldon books to appreaciate this one.  In fact, not knowing there are other books lends an even sweeter sorrow to this story.<br />Ignore the fact this is marketed in the &quot;romance&quot; section of book stores, and simply accept it as an utterly delightful romp through history with a powerful romantic element woven into the war, politics, intrigue, accusations of witchcraft, treason, and personal drama.	2000-12-13

Can he learn all there is to find, in order to keep on top of his job?  For what is there for the unemployed in Victorian London other than social shame and the poorhouse's cold charity?<br />Forced to seek himself without letting anyone else in on the secret - he appeals to me on multiple levels.  (So many &quot;want to find themselves&quot;, but don't want to admit they're looking.)<br />A gritty, gruesome look at the reality behind the trashy romance novels of our day, Perry gives Dickens a run for his money in attemptying to portray a hand-to-mouth existance cohabitating with the posh luxury of 1850's London.<br />Those familiar with 19th Century literature or who simply have a well-educated vocabulary will have little or no need of linguistic assistance.  The standard American high school education will probably leave you needing a good English dictionary for some of the slang used (or interpreting English currency).<br />It is a toss-up between Face of a Stranger or Sins of the Wolf, as to which is her best book to date (Dec. 2000).	2000-12-13
US	52683755	R3D4D9OYS3J6AH	0061057541	18473604	Byzantium	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	Faith above Accuracy	Byzantium is a story of a man's faith, its failings, and its resurrection.  It is set in a real history, which - like any historical fiction - has been molded to the author's needs.  The specifics may be flawed (as are we all), but the flavor is exquisite.<br />High excitement:  marauding vikings, nomadic arabs, opulent Byzantine cathedrals, byzantine politics, and humble Irish monks on an ecclesiastical quest.  Does the hero live or die?  Will he regain his faith or not?  Will they all make it back to Ireland?<br />I was deeply moved by the depth and feelings portrayed in the hero's struggle with the burdens of a belief in God and the attendant burdens of faith.<br />What is the point of the book?  It is the portrait of a man's faith in God, and the reality that even the saints, martyrs, and holy men of the great ages past were human.<br />Complaints about this book seem to revolve primarily arround historical inaccuracies of fact/language - if you want a history book, I suggest you look somewhere other than the &quot;fiction&quot; section of a bookstore.	2000-12-08

What more could a person want??<br />A departure from the norm of Marrayat, Lambdin, Pope, et al. - our hero isn't in the Royal Navy.  Great shades of Martin Guerre, a no-body shows up in Virginia to settle down to a life of farming.  Fickle Fate denies him, throwing him back to the Sea in defense of his newly chosen home.<br />But ... now confronted with the potentially wonderful life he has found, will his past rise out of Neptune's deep to pull him back again?<br />Obviously designed to allow for further installments, this stands alone without leaving you completely hanging at wit's end for what comes next, so that you can enjoy Nelson's other writings of the Revolutionary era.	2000-12-02

We finally have the flushing out of his character (and others) lacking in the previous book.  Tracing the development of the U.S. Navy from it's tentative nascent beginnings as a rag-tag fleet of fishing vessels through the point of view of a merchant-turned man of war captain, you get the same thrilling chase, wind-in-your hair, reek of gunsmoke as any other series of nautical fiction.  You just get it from the Yanks' point of view.<br />Finally, the Royal Navy is the 'bad guy'.  (The RN isn't painted as as evil, they're just the enemy.)<br />Thankfully, we Yanks finally have a delightful read of our own history, rather than being subjected to a solely British-based view of 18th C. sailing (admittedly, since Britainia then Ruled the Waves, they now rule the pages of literature).  I love Forrester, Marrayat, Lambdin, Pope, et al., but I am thrilled to finally find my own nation's history on the pages of nautical fiction as the focal point, rather than a side bar.<br />Run, do not walk, to the closest bookstore to get this, and the others.	2000-12-02

Vivid.  Almost too vivid (but isn't life?).<br />This is the first of E.George's books I read.  After  reading all of the others (except for In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner),  this is still the best one.<br />Riviting presentation of the plot from an  unexpected view point (one of the suspects).  I find it enjoyable to be  able to read a mystery novel and have the end remain a mystery until I get  there.<br />Reading the books in order might be beneficial for people who  enjoy the character development across several volumes, but isn't necessary  to the enjoyment of the book.<br />If you only buy one of Elizabeth George's  books, this is the one to get.	2000-06-27
