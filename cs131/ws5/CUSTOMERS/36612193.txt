I have read a vast quantity of books in my lifetime and believe that I have come across several great classics that fell through the cracks.  This is one of them.  There is hitch to this!  It is parallel to the fate of The Jungle by Upton Sinclair.  The Jungle was written to agitate social change and hit the literal stomach instead.  The Substance of Civilization was written for light scientific interest and hit the survivalist instinct instead. <br /> <br />I came across this book during the time of Y2K concerns.  This is a pertinant survivalist handbook.  It is how to start an economy from the literal dirt.  I think this book  draws the standard or baseline in answering, \\"How much science  does an adult survivalist need to know?\\"  Some people will find themselves short of science to meet this reasonable standard of scientific literacy.  (I recommend the Beka science text books sold at Christian Liberty starting with the 4th grade.  I think that is the one that teaches you how to measure the temperature through the use of a cricket.  The 4th grade science book without meaning to unwinds those long descriptive garden walks in British 19th century novels. A reader is a little more clued in.)	2005-10-07

It's main purpose is to train the student to write on par with Joseph Addison. It requires The Spectator by Joseph Addison.  I found The Spectator in two volumes on Alibris, excellent condition, J. B. Lippincott Company 1890.  You're to read a piece by Joseph Addison three times and then you attempt to write what you have just read.  Thus it's important to find a copy of the The Spectator that doesn't have any editing by Joe Blow.   <br /> <br />You're expected to know Latin and it is assumed that you do so.    There are interpretations of the Latin at the end of each chapter but it is disruptive.   <br /> <br />It's excellent.  I highly recommend it.  I also recommend the simplified Christian dialect that is the present fad and learning material from Memoria Press to start the Latin.	2005-10-07

It is top quality, intense, and thorough.  The only hitch to this is the \\"3 months.\\"  It requires time.  Pronounciation in size is closer to learning English.  It's big.  Latin is a paragraph, Ancient Greek is a page, French is two pages, German is twenty-four  pages...and english pronounciation is a book (Handy English Encoder Decoder by  Bluedorn) to put this into perspective.  Twenty-four pages of pronounciaion key is a whole lot for the first week.  Can we say *INTENSE*?  I had a semester in college twenty years ago and it isn't helping me here.   I'm in the second year of German with Learnables (I recommend it since the first year can be achieved within a couple of weeks.  Great stuff for the self esteem.) and I'm still working on the 24 pages of Hugo in 3 months pronounciation key.   <br /> <br />What I love about the Hugo in 3 months is that I understand what is being spoken in the German conversations which appear to me to be rather complex.  \\"That's no so easy....Just a moment...You go over the crosswalk, second street....\\"  That is from the 3rd week.   <br /> <br />I bought a wonderful book titled, \\"Beginner's German Reader,\\" ISBN 0-8442-2170-8 <br />that can be achieved swiftly.  It works hand in hand with both Learnables second year and Hugo in 3 Months.  (Another self esteem builder.)	2005-10-07

What will come in the mail is a real cheap looking and slim paper back if you order it. Your first thought will probably be, \\"Oh, more of the dumb down?

Every internal alarm bell will be ringing that you bought \\"2005 garbage\\" and it is the exact opposite dating all the way back to John Milton and his letter on education.  It's an itty handful of vocabulary, a skillful dodge around all that you do not need to know to read ancient Greek, and grammar in increments.  That IS the John Milton educational formula.   <br /> <br />Peter Jones is a British man and oh is he a British man!  Pure British.  Nothing but British in entirety.  There is \\"to be\\" and there is \\"to seem.\\"  He is \\"to be.\\"  One knows that upon opening his book and dating Peter Jones all the way back to John Milton and that letter on education.  It is the 21st century and he does speak to the reader in light modern banter. <br /> <br />This is it folks.  John Milton in all his glory.  Educational system O' John Milton, Jones University, 1644, England.   <br /> <br />(My Milton reference is a used copy of The Portable Milton, edited by Douglas Bush, the Viking Portable Library.

Oh thank goodness I bought this book because I erroneously had \\"La Princesse de Cleves\\" as an antique cutsie. <br /> <br />A Book such as \\"Facets Of A Princess\\" runs the risk in these times of being politically correct revisionism.   In this case an author due to the times could step forward and point out a few obvious things, that no one would want to be the first to say, without losing his career and personal reputation.      <br /> <br /> <br />In the meantime, I'd advise readers to drop any rounds of, \\"Hey has anybody else read La Princess de La Cleves?\\"  First read \\"Facets Of A Princess\\" and know that you're bringing up the topic of masturbation. <br /> <br />I sincerely wish Michael G. Paulson felt called upon to scrutinze \\"The Novellino or One Hundred Ancient Tales\\" edited and translated by Joseph P. Consoli.  A very real expert on the deliberately done sexual symbols in antiquity is needed in my opinion.  These are the tales the Holy Knights of the Crusades read, loved, and retold while on the crusades, which includes the obscene \\"giving the finger\\" used during that time etc.  It's the not so obvious that must be sitting there unnoticed or unmentioned, a Pandora's Box, and like a time capsule for someone to open.  It's that THEY knew the One Hundred Ancient Tales!   Oh, but to have a window open wide on those men, those people out there in that horror, that is accurate, not revisionism, or an attack on Christians!   I'm voting that Michael G. Paulson is that potential expert.   <br /> <br />\\"Facets Of A Princess\\" sort of makes a person want to pull out books like Aucassin and Nicolette, The Novellino, or Old French Romances for a reread as if a person <br />is now up to par enough to notice a few things for him or herself.  It's because the rose tinted colored glasses are gone.  The reader grasps, \\"These authors were people who wrote for people...and are not some twisted combination of cave man/Victorian Era make believe people those in the year of 2005 havethem up to be.\\"  The Novellino readers and Canterbury Tale readers will do fantastic with \\"Facets Of A Princess\\" because they've already caught on that the people of the past were real people as we know people to be.   <br /> <br />What a fine book!  What can I say?  How about, \\"It's semi large print, easy to read, <br />there are some paragraphs in French but it won't matter since you'll next be found at Alibris searching frantically for all the books Madame de La Fayette read thus creating her mind. \\"	2005-08-04

Even readable and with clear stories a person can follow there's no doubt that Norse myths are difficult to feel an affinity towards.   <br /> <br />It is a pure positive \\"can do\\" experience.

It should have been \\"Simple essay on...pick any great.\\"  At least a formal student could sound better standing up in class.  Classical Latin is basically worthless.  It serves only an academic interest thus the topics should have been towards that.  Perhaps some help coming up with a few creative ala Ovid comments? <br /> <br />I felt like I was being asked to go mad listening to the \\"oral proficiency\\" of mother calling her daughter in this supposed \\"life like manner.\\"   <br /> <br />Don't land yourself in a looney bin listening to this stuff.  This treatment of it as if it were Spanish puts my neck hairs up on end.  What is next?  People steal the white bedsheets off the hotel bed in a new and different Jerusalem Syndrome lost in delusions of Ancient Rome?   <br /> <br />It gave me the creeps.	2004-11-02
US	36612193	R32LCX09BEILCV	0879307277	583240818	The Piano Handbook: A Complete Guide for Mastering Piano	Books	2	50	267	N	Y	Problems	I found this book to be a huge basket filled with \\"piano\\" that was dumped on my head seemingly all at once.   <br /> <br />It feeds the ego in that it is very \\"classy\\" in appearance.  Beware of the ego. <br /> <br />Problems: <br /> <br />It does not address the common 61 keyboard.  You will find yourself perplexed staring at TWO possible middle C keys.  You will end up discouraged and on the net searching out a free on-line instruction course to share with you which \\"C\\" it is.  (It is the one on the left.) <br /> <br />It dumps vastly complex material, way over your head and need, right at the start, if are the raw newbie, who didn't know there was such a thing as a \\"middle C.\\"  You don't need to know intricate Italian or Latin wording for months ahead of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star (Which is also missing), and because it is missing you're in for a nasty jolt learning to read the music by sight especially the bass.  It is the British put it this way versus the Americans who express that way...all this for a person who is learning there is such a thing as a \\"middle C?\\" <br /> <br />It is pretentious. <br /> <br />So which shall it be?  Do you want to head into jazz or great classical music?  Never mind that you cannot play Home on the Range.  And you're going to be hard pressed to play Jingle Bells. <br /> <br /> <br />I throw books that fail me in the trash can.  This one was thrown away.  I don't regret having purchased it.  That seems odd in a way.  It isn't.  We all have to start somewhere.  To buy this book is to sit in wreckage.  It's fragments of \\"paino\\" raining down all around oneself.  Some of the fragments were worthy.  How do you even go forth and know what program to buy if you can't \\"discover\\" yourself and those fragments a little bit? <br /> <br />You'll discover that many \\"Play the piano\\" books have problems all of which are different.   <br /> <br />I went through Jan Durrants course (She's an independent out on the web) along with scraps from this book to grasp \\"there is such a thing as a B key.)  They went into the trash can together when I was done.  The point of the trash can for me was, \\"Gee, I can see that I need many rounds of Twinkle Twinkle and Row Row Your Boat to sight read the notes, because timing is hopeless if I don't.\\"  It was onward and forward to a new and different course that is more concentrated on Twinkle Twinkle.  <br /> <br />If you are an adult who was forced to take piano lessons as a kid for YEARS, you bucked it all, and now twenty years later are taking a new look at it-this book is for you.  You won't find it \\"a basket of piano dumped on my head.\\"  You'll know what to do with all these fragments raining down around you.   <br /> <br />If you're a newbie too, well, for whatever reason we're not obtaining professional and valid lessons, but are going the route of the independent.  This is just on par. In with one course and out with another.  A miracle course isn't out there that I have found.  Be sure you find Gilbert DeBenedetti out on the web for those free music sheets of Twinkle Twinkle.  You're going to need those especially for that bass.  (He also has a course which I ordered but it hasn't arrived yet.)  Be sure also to obtain <br />The Secrets to Playing Piano By Ear by Germaine Griggs out on the web.  (You might find the free CD part useless on an XP.)  That is a music theory workbook which is not quite \\"learning how to play the piano.\\"  It fights the dumb down.  He is one of those \\"genius kids\\" we sometimes hear about on the news.  He is about 20 right now.  The true genius (factually) knows how to speak to the people.  You'll learn.  No problems.  You're own version of Twinkle by ear is ahead of you.  If you're going to do this-do it right.  Music theory has to sit right next to your practice sheets of Twinkle.   <br /> <br />I am at the stage in less than a month (And this book was my first) of \\"I know a lot from my own perspective.  Knowing numerous things does not makefor adequate swiftness in reading music.  I am officially way past \\"There is such a thing as a middle C,\\" and this weird looking thing means two beats.\\"  I can pick out a few of the songs from the SSPX church hymn book, and the Lingua Angelica song book.   Scrap timing.  My bass side in sight reading is deplorable beyond description.  On to  <br />DeBenedetti to see if this imbalance, (representing serious cracks), can be fixed.  The fragments raining down all at once created a Frankenstein piano player.  I didn't sign myself up as an independent to be a musical monster.  This was not my goal.  This is how it is turning out for me.	2004-11-02

Uh.  Uh.  Buyer beware on this one. <br />For the money you can buy oh so much better than this one. <br /> <br />I recommend Lingua Latina Familia Romana as a reader to have a ball with.  It is dirt cheap and can be purchased from Angelus Press.  It is one of those \\"soul satisfiers.\\" <br />\\"I have yet to grasp Wheelock Chapter One\\" will have a righteous good time with Familia Romana.  I mean \\"no problem.\\"  Those holding steady will really get into it. <br /> <br />You can't place the two next each other and allow 38 Stories to sell itself as a reader.  It just won't work.   <br /> <br />So far as learning the \\"god and goddess\\" part if that is your crises just head for Bulfinch.  You can obtain it for free from Blackmask on the web in ebook, or you can buy a beautiful paperback copy from Amazon.  38 Stories isn't how to do that.  The wheel doesn't have to be reinvented in bizarre new ways.  You're not going to struggle with recognizing which name in Latin is Minerva once you've enough declensions to head for the real thing.  Fear only fear.  No problem is ahead.  You'll know Minerva when you see her.	2004-11-02

You know that the nation of America has a crises in education.  You know that you're not an exception to this crises.   <br /> <br />You move one hand towards this book and you are a beginner.  Fine.  Buy it.  It is excellent and you don't need a magnifier to read it.  Let me tell you something that I bumped into.  I purchased a 40,000 plus API dictionary searching for a new system of phonetics for english which I am a native of.  I was amazed that I knew every single word in this dictionary.  40,000 plus!  You do too.  You also know those 40,000 plus words.  I promise you that you do, and I do know that the world is not impressed with your articulation and vocabulary.   <br /> <br />No one beyond a beginner has 501 verbs.  Beware of very YOUNG and pretentious <br />reviews concerning this book.  They are victims of the dumb down.  No fault of their own.  They have usually finished \\"Wheelock\\" and speak with an \\"academic perception\\" on this.   They graduated on a beginner level and do not know it.   <br /> <br />You better know these 501 verbs!  You had better know these 501 verbs by the end of that first \\"Wheelock\\" chapter and before you come off pretentious with deep regret later on in your life.  Just keep humble.  You're a \\"newbie\\" and \\"one who is struggling along\\" until you're hand never reaches for this book and you'd die of shame if anyone saw you with it. <br /> <br />You see the truth if you ever come across an API dictionary for those learning English.  40,000 plus words and yet the \\"graduate of Latin\\" is tolerated reaching out for \\"501 verbs.\\" <br /> <br />Umph.  Most absolutely buy this book.  You're in a serious crises landing here.  One thing that dumb down is known for is that it also has a parallel \\"self-esteem\\" social program operating in conjuntion with it.  You can't keep this book.  You'll die of shame.    Learn it all and chuck it.  Competence in Latin is at approximately40,000 plus words.  If you don't believe me-you just go forth out onto the web and purchase for yourself the Heinles' Newbury House Dictionary of American English!  It represents minimum competence level for English.  Not many \\"fancy\\" words exist in it. <br /> <br />Fix yourself.  That is a must if you're intent is to present yourself as \\"educated.\\" It is a repair job and not to be doubted.  A clock does tick on the independents.  You also landed here!  I shall pray on your behalf that you did not tell people you could \\"read\\" or \\"speak\\" Latin.   <br /> <br />Oh, it is a \\"Quick everybody, grab your copy and head for the closet, pull out your flashlights and secretly drill yourself on the 501 Verbs!\\"	2004-11-02

This is shocking.  <br />  <br /> The workbook itself merely alerts you that you have to memorize, as a Bard, exactly word for word, the Wheelock 6e. I kid you not. One slight grammer mention has to be memorized and the work book &quot;tests&quot; you on your Barding skills. You mime Wheelock not Latin. He says; You say. Word for word.	2004-08-02
US	36612193	R1PLSU5LGX4A1	0060956410	889503795	Wheelock's Latin, 6th Edition	Books	2	4	34	N	Y	Snotty	Wheelock deliberately brow beats to the point of rendering the book useless. You begin learning the vocabulary through references to French, German, and musical in the know. You also discover as you start the work book that the introduction in 6e is a three to six week course unto itself, and that with Wheelock you aren't taught to think but are taught that you must memorize the slightest and almost every sentence in 6e. It's a bad book but we're all stuck with it. How this book ever came to be published is a mystery and possibly reveals that personal connections achieve the publication of a book.  <br />  <br /> I had already been using the Rosetti Latin course as an independent. You'll need that too, because you're sure not going to learn months, yes, no, and the complexity of the spoken numbers, etc with Wheelock. On the flip side you won't get any syntax mastery from the Rosetti.  <br />  <br /> It's a nightmare out there for anyone trying to learn Latin as an independent. The material is bad! I don't advise running out and taking a course. The academic schools are producing bad fruit as we can see from the lack of daring people and their audio mp3's.  <br />  <br /> A commercial school might be the wisest choice but only after a long time mastering as much as possible independently first.  <br />  <br /> Wheelock is a waste of money but as I said we're all stuck. Just try to get other methods in as well. I am finishing the Rosetti and waiting for the delivery of Transparent Language. Good grief! For a million dollars in material MAYBE you too can learn Latin! Me? I am still stuck on the French, German, and musical in the know references to sounds. <br />  <br /> Oh it is bad out there. Wheelock is just one more BADLY produced &quot;Learn Latin!&quot; <br />  <br />	2004-08-02
